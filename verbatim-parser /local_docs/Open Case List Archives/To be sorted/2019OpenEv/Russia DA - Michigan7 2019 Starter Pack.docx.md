#### Russian arms sales are [capped]{.underline} now\-\--that [limits the capacity]{.underline} for Russian expansionism

**Bershidsky** 3-12-20**19** -- founding editor of the Russian business
daily Vedomosti and founded the opinion website Slon.ru. (Leonid,
"[Trump Is Winning]{.underline}, [[Putin\'s Losing]{.mark} in Global
[Arms Sales]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Russia is losing [market
share]{.mark}]{.underline} despite Vladimir Putin\'s international
military adventures.," Bloomberg,
<https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-03-12/u-s-is-no-1-in-arms-sales-as-russia-loses-market-share)//BB>

[[Global arms sales are on the increase]{.underline}]{.mark}, consistent
with the growing number of conflicts and deaths brought about by them.
[[The U.S. and its allies have been the main beneficiaries. Russia, by
contrast, is on the decline]{.underline}]{.mark}, a sign that Vladimir
Putin's geopolitical bets aren't turning into long-term influence. The
world has grown significantly less violent since 1950, but [there has
been an marked uptick in the number of armed conflicts]{.underline} in
recent years. The emergence of Islamic State, hostilities in eastern
Ukraine, and the persecution of the Rohingya in Myanmar are just some
examples. The number of fatalities has increased even more dramatically,
according to the Uppsala Conflict Data Program. Between 2011 and 2017,
the average annual death toll from conflict neared 97,000, three times
more than in the previous seven-year period. That helps to explain the
7.8 percent increase in international arms transfers from 2014 to 2018
compared with the previous five-year period seen in the latest data from
the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the global
authority on the weapons trade. The Middle East has been absorbing
weapons at an alarming pace: The flow of armaments to the region
rocketed by 87 percent in the last five years. [Russia took an active
part in the bloodiest of the conflicts, but it doesn't appear to have
been able to convert this into more sales]{.underline}. It was the only
one of the world's top five exporters, which together account for 75
percent of the business, to suffer a major loss in market share. It
remains the world's second-biggest arms exporter. SIPRI has its own,
rather complicated, system for calculating transfer volumes based on the
military value of the equipment traded rather than on its market price.
But in dollar terms, too, Russia trails the U.S. Yury Borisov, Russia's
deputy prime minister in charge of the defense industry, said last month
that [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} "steadily reaches" \$15 billion in
[[arms]{.underline} [exports]{.underline}]{.mark} a year and hopes to
retain that amount. This suggests officials believe sales **[[have hit a
ceiling]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [By contrast, the U.S. closed \$55.6
billion of arms deals in 2018, 33 percent more than in
2017]{.underline}, thanks to the Trump administration's liberalization
of weapons exports. According to the SIPRI figures, U.S. exports were 75
percent higher than Russia's in 2014 through 2018 -- a far wider gap
than in the previous five-year period. For the U.S., Middle Eastern
countries have been especially important -- particularly Saudi Arabia,
the world's largest arms importer, and its major irritant, Qatar. Some
52 percent of U.S. weapons sales were to the Middle East in the last
five years. Under President Donald Trump, the relationship with Saudi
Arabia became even more lucrative for the defense industry. For
[Russia]{.underline}, the Middle East accounted only for 16 percent of
its weapons exports over the same period, with most going to Egypt and
Iraq. Its major [trade partners were India, China and Algeria -- but
sales to India dropped significantly]{.underline} as its government
sought to diversify suppliers and bought more from the U.S., South Korea
and, most painfully for the Kremlin, Ukraine. [[Russia has been losing
key]{.mark} aircraft [tenders]{.mark} in India]{.underline} to the U.S.
[This, along with [the economic collapse of]{.mark} another major
client, [Venezuela, and]{.mark} the current potential for [regime change
in Algeria, all makes a rebound in Russian sales look
**unlikely**]{.mark}. [Arms sales are]{.mark}]{.underline} perhaps [[the
best]{.mark} [reflection of]{.mark} a major military power's
[international influence]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The market
is]{.mark}n't all about price and]{.underline} quality
[competition]{.underline}; [it's [about permanent and situational
alliances]{.mark}]{.underline}. The growing gap between the U.S. and
Russia in exports shows that [[Putin's forays]{.underline}]{.mark} into
areas such as the Middle East [are failing to translate into Russian
influence]{.underline} in the region. [Although Putin's warm relations
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah
el-[[Sisi]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and]{.mark} his alliance with
[Iran]{.mark},]{.underline} which has a lot of influence over Iraq, [are
paying off to some extent, they [**can't quite compensate** for **ground
lost elsewhere**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The U.S.'s allies, France,
Germany and the U.K. among them, have been rapidly increasing their
market share, too. That's a rarely mentioned way in which the security
alliance with Washington is paying off for the Europeans. All the
ethical objections to selling arms to countries such as Saudi Arabia
notwithstanding, European Union member states need markets for their
defense industries, which employ about 500,000 people. Being under the
U.S. umbrella opens doors where Russia and China are less desirable
partners -- that is, in most of the world. Many tears have been shed in
the U.S. about the collapse of the American-led global order. But [if
you take arms sales as a proxy for influence]{.underline}, the U.S.'s
global dominance looks to be resilient. In a more conflict-prone,
competitive world, [[America is doing rather well while its]{.mark}
longstanding geopolitical [rivals stumble]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### The plan leaves a [supply vacuum]{.underline} for Russia to exploit \-\-- they'll use it to [advance geopolitical power]{.underline}

**Bodner 17** -- analyst @ Defense News (Matthew, "Sales target: Russia
sets its sights on the Middle East," *Defense News*,
<https://www.defensenews.com/digital-show-dailies/dubai-air-show/2017/11/09/sales-target-russia-sets-its-sights-on-the-middle-east/)//BB>

The view from Moscow

[[Russia's arms sales]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Middle East do not
take place in a vacuum. While driven by defense industry interests, they
[[are]{.mark} seen in Moscow as [part of a broader Russian effort to
reassert itself as a player of major consequence]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Russia's expert community likes to talk of an emerging multipolar world
order, and Moscow in many ways tries to act as if that is already the
case]{.underline}. But it is difficult to attribute any strategy to its
actions. "Russia is not seeking to displace the U.S. in the Middle East,
just cut it down to size," says Vladimir Frolov, an independent Russian
foreign affairs analyst. "[Russia sees [weapons sales]{.mark} as
additional leverage and a tool to [create dependency on
Moscow]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Sales]{.underline}]{.mark} to the Gulf,
particularly to Saudi, [[are]{.mark} seen as [a tool for]{.mark} other
[foreign policy objectives, to facilitate agreements on political issues
and create stakeholders in relations with Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}."
While arms sales are certainly seen by the government as tools in a
larger game, the arms trade in Russia is a little more complicated than
that. "To a great extent these deals are often worked out
independently," according to CAST's Andrey Frolov. "For example,
deliveries to Syria are handled by the Defense Ministry and taken from
military stores. The state export agency Rosoboronexport has nothing to
do with this." This jibes with the sometimes diffused nature of
decision-making in Russia. Contrary to common perception, Putin does not
preside over everything that happens. He sets the general tone and path,
and hundreds of officials below him try to interpret and act according
to perceived wishes. This makes dealing with Russia difficult, but it
also makes formulating and pursuing broad strategy difficult for the
Kremlin. As far as Russia's competition with the U.S. in the Middle East
arms trade goes, the situation was best described by independent analyst
Vladimir Frolov: "[[Russia's strategy in weapons sales is to sell
everything to everyone with]{.mark} little geopolitical consideration
and [zero human rights concern]{.mark}]{.underline}. And **[[Russians
will]{.underline}]{.mark}** [try to]{.underline} [[**seize every
opportunity** where the U.S. is seen as an unreliable
partner]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Egypt]{.mark} [and Turkey
are]{.mark}]{.underline} just the most [[recent]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[examples]{.underline}]{.mark}."

#### New arms markets are key to [all facets]{.underline} of Russian expansionism

This last potential challenge illustrates that the arms trade is as much
driven by developments in the geopolitical marketplace as it is by
commercial concerns. In turn, the multidimensional nature of the arms
trade suggests that [Russia will make great efforts to ensure that it
remains successful]{.underline} in this industry for decades to come.
[This is likely to involve]{.underline} a concerted effort to ensure
that sufficient domestic investment in productive capabilities will take
place to guarantee that new weapons systems emerge. It is also likely to
involve [policymakers attempting to wield arms exports as a component of
wider foreign policy]{.underline}. Indeed, it is this final point that
deserves greater attention by researchers in the future. If, as Keith
Krause has argued, [arms exports serve as an important tool wielded by
states in pursuit of other foreign policy objectives]{.underline}, then
it is plausible that [Russia's strong position in the global arms
market]{.underline} might be expected to [boost the country's position
in international affairs more widely]{.underline}.90 In addition to the
economic motives behind arms sales, Krause suggests that [arms exports
can help states both in the pursuit of victory in war and in the broader
pursuit of power in the international arena]{.underline}.91 [Both
motives appear to lie behind Russian arms exports]{.underline} in a
number of cases. For Krause, [arms exports]{.underline} can help the
exporting country achieve several objectives in the pursuit of the
beneficiary country's victory in war. They include: guaranteeing
independence of arms supply to ensure military security;
[act]{.underline}ing [as a quid pro quo for military base/landing
rights]{.underline}; [assist]{.underline}ing friends and [allies in
maintaining an effective]{.underline} (and/or common) [defensive posture
against external threats]{.underline}; substituting for direct military
involvement; [and providing testing for new weapons
systems]{.underline}. It is not difficult to find at least prima facie
evidence for these motives playing some role in motivating Russian arms
exports to Armenia, Syria and Tajikistan. When looking at the role arms
exports play in supporting the exporter's pursuit of geopolitical power,
Krause states that [the sale of weaponry can help to: provide access to
and influence over leaders and elites in recipient states in pursuit of
foreign policy objectives; symbolize commitment to the recipient's
security or stability against internal or external threats]{.underline};
[create or maintain a regional balance of power]{.underline}; [create or
maintain a regional presence; and provide access to scarce]{.underline},
expensive or [strategic resources]{.underline}. It is likely that at
least some of [these motives are present in Russia's sales]{.underline}
to countries all over the world. Moreover, [the zeal shown by Russian
firms in expanding arms exports]{.underline} to countries beyond their
traditional client base -- such as to Saudi Arabia, Turkey or the
Philippines -- [is surely]{.underline} as much [to do with]{.underline}
the possibility of [weakening ties between those countries and their
traditional allies in the West]{.underline}. [It is in this respect that
Russia's future performance as an arms exporter might have truly
strategic significance. If Russia is able to expand its
influence]{.underline} **[beyond its traditional markets]{.underline}**,
[we should expect to see Russia's **broader political
influence**]{.underline} in those regions [rise]{.underline}. In this
sense, [the motives underlying the **strenuous Russian efforts to expand
arms exports**]{.underline} might well [go beyond simple commercial
concerns]{.underline} or a desire to place the defence-industrial
complex at the centre of efforts to modernize the Russian economy.

#### Expanded Russian influence leads to nuclear war and collapses the international order

**Gray 17** -- PhD, professor of International Relations and Strategic
Studies at the University of Reading, where he is the director of the
Centre for Strategic Studies (Colin, "Russian strategy Expansion, crisis
and conflict," Foreword, in *Comparative Strategy*, 36.1)//BB, sex

[Short of war]{.underline} itself, [the international political and
strategic relations between Russia and the United States are about as
bad as they can be]{.underline}. Indeed, it [is no exaggeration to say
that]{.underline} the simultaneous [conduct]{.underline} of two air
independent campaigns over Syria [could evolve]{.underline} all too
[suddenly into a war triggered by **accident or by
miscalculation**]{.underline}. [There is little]{.underline}, if any,
[mystery about the broad political purpose fueling]{.underline} Vladimir
[Putin's]{.underline} [conduct]{.underline} of international relations.
Subtlety is not a characteristic of Russian statecraft; cunning and
intended trickery, though, are another matter. Stated directly, [Putin
is striving to recover and restore]{.underline} that of which he is able
from [the]{.underline} late [USSR]{.underline}. There is no ideological
theme in his governance. Instead, [there is an historically unremarkable
striving after more power and influence]{.underline}. The challenge for
the Western World, as demonstrated in this National Institute study in
meticulous and troubling detail, is to decide where and when this latest
episode in [Russian expansionism]{.underline} will be stopped. What we
do know, for certain, is that it **[must]{.underline}** and will **[be
halted]{.underline}**. It is more likely than not that
[Putin]{.underline} himself does not have entirely fixed
political-strategic objectives. His behavior of recent years has given a
credible impression of opportunistic adaptability. In other words, he
[will take what he is able, where he can, and when he can]{.underline}.
However, [there is ample evidence to support]{.underline}
[this]{.underline} study's [proposition that Russian state policy today
is driven by a clear vision of]{.underline} Russia as a recovering and
somewhat restored superpower, very much on the high road back to a
[renewed hegemony]{.underline} over Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
[Putin's international political objectives appear largely open today:
he will have Russia take whatever turns out to be available to take,
preferably if the taking allows for]{.underline} some [humiliation of
the]{.underline} principal enemy, the [United States]{.underline}. A
practical political and strategic problem for Putin is to guess just how
far he dares to push NATO in general and the United States in
particular, before he finds himself, almost certainly unexpectedly, in a
situation analogous to 1939. Just how dangerous would it be for Russia
to press forcefully the Baltic members of NATO? Vladimir [Putin would
not be the first states]{.underline}man \[[person]{.underline}\] [to
trust his luck once too often, based upon unrealistic confidence in his
own political genius and power]{.underline}. There is danger not only
that [Putin could miscalculate the military worth of Russia's
hand]{.underline}, but that he also will misunderstand the practical
political and strategic strength of NATO 'red lines.' In particular,
Putin may well discover, despite some current appearances, that not all
of NATO's political leaders are expediently impressionable and very
readily deterrable. [Putin's military instrument is heavily
dependent]{.underline}, indeed probably over-dependent,
[upon]{.underline} the bolstering value of a whole inventory of
**[nuclear weapons]{.underline}**. It is unlikely to have evaded Putin's
strategic grasp to recognize that these are not simply weapons like any
others. [A single political]{.underline} or strategic guess in
[error]{.underline} [could well place us]{.underline}, Russians
included, [in a world **horrifically new** to all]{.underline}. This
National Institute study, Russian Strategy: Expansion, Crisis and
Conflict, makes unmistakably clear Putin's elevation of strategic
intimidation to be the leading element in Russian grand strategy today.
Putin is behaving in militarily dangerous ways and 'talking the talk'
that goes with such rough behavior. Obviously, he is calculating,
perhaps just hoping, that American lawyers in the White House will
continue to place highest priority on avoiding direct confrontation with
Russia. This study presents an abundantly clear record of the Russian
lack of regard for international law, which they violate with apparent
impunity and without ill consequence to themselves, including virtually
every arms control treaty and agreement they have entered into with the
United States since 1972 (SALT I). [The challenge for the United
States]{.underline} today and tomorrow [is]{.underline} the need
[urgently to]{.underline} decide what can and must be done to [**stop
Putin's campaign in its tracks** before it wreaks **lethal damage** to
the vital concept and physical structure of international order in much
of the world]{.underline}, and particularly in Europe.

## UNIQUENESS

#### Russian arms sales [and]{.underline} their defense industry are [low now]{.underline}

**Stratfor 4-29**-2019 - American geopolitical intelligence platform and
publisher founded in 1996 in Austin, Texas, by George Friedman, who was

2018. Fred Burton is Stratfor\'s chief security officer ("Russia\'s
Defense Industry Finds Itself in a Tailspin," *Strafor Worldview*,
<https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/russias-defense-industry-finds-itself-tailspin)//BB>

[Russia\'s defense industry is face to face with a major
foe]{.underline}, but it\'s not a foreign military power. [The Kremlin
has been striving to modernize all branches of the Russian military, but
the country\'s defense industry is struggling thanks to decreasing
volumes of orders, difficulties in attracting]{.underline} high-skilled
[talent and limits to its]{.underline} technological
[capabilities]{.underline}. According to recent figures, [the
performance of Russia\'s aerospace sector is declining
precipitously]{.underline}. In 2018, for instance, Russian aircraft and
spacecraft makers produced 13.5 percent less than in 2017. And there\'s
been no letup [in 2019]{.underline} either: In the first two months of
the year, [aerospace output plummeted 48 percent]{.underline} year on
year. [The decline in Russia\'s defense output raises concerns about the
competitive strength of Russia\'s defense industry in general, whose
health is critical if the country is to project itself as a military
power]{.underline} in the longer term. Russian Deputy Prime Minister
Yuri Borisov attributed the reduction in output to a slowdown of orders
for military systems, but projections suggest [the slowdown is not just
a short-term fluctuation]{.underline}; in fact, [it\'s expected to
become even worse]{.underline} in the future[. The downturn in oil
prices has taken a bite out of Russia\'s bottom line, squeezing spending
for the military]{.underline} --- all at a time when the country\'s arms
manufacturers have lost their competitive edge in the global arms
market. Together, these factors ensure that [Russia\'s defense industry
will struggle to get out of its funk]{.underline}. Suffering From a
Dearth of Funds This dire picture stands in stark contrast to Russia\'s
frequent presentation of sensational new platforms. In reality, however,
just a few of the big-ticket weapon systems --- such as the T-14 main
battle tank or the Su-57 fighter aircraft --- find buyers, as the rest
remain mere prototypes. Russia has prioritized some hardware, such as
the Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, due to their strategic
relevance to the country\'s overall military posture, but Moscow has
failed to fully develop other programs or only introduced them on a
limited scale. [Under pressure]{.underline} from a limited government
budget, [the Kremlin even started reducing its military
spending]{.underline} in 2017 --- a strong indicator that, despite the
modernization push, Russia\'s financial challenges are taking a toll on
the country ambitions. Economically, the plunge in oil prices at the end
of 2014 hurt Russia\'s bottom line, depriving the country of essential
revenue and forcing it to dip into its reserves to bridge the gap.
Today, more than four years on, Russian oil revenues are rising, yet the
country is continuing to deal with the consequences of the lean years.
Beyond that, low revenues from taxes, which have forced Russia to raise
taxes and the retirement age, and Western sanctions over Moscow\'s
activities in Ukraine and elsewhere, have shrunk the financial pool
available to military planners. Low oil prices, declining revenues from
taxes and Western sanctions have taken a chunk out of the financial pool
available to Russia\'s military and the broader defense industry. But
the Kremlin\'s problems don\'t end there. [In the past, Russia has
benefited from its position as a major global arms exporter to fuel
further military development. During the 1990s, for example, such sales
were critical to the country as it faced severe economic
hardship]{.underline}. While [Russia remains the world\'s second-largest
arms exporter (only the United States sells more), the actual value of
those exports has been **decreasing significantly**]{.underline}.
Between 2014 and 2018, their total value dropped by as much as 17
percent. Again, budgetary limits are somewhat to blame: [In the past,
Russia frequently used arms exports as a political tool]{.underline},
offering weapons at a heavy discount, if not entirely free.
[But]{.underline} with Russia no longer able to offer customers a good
deal on its fighter jets and other defense products, [the country is
**losing business**]{.underline}.

#### US pressure is whittling away at Russians arms markets now

**Khlebnikov 19** - expert on the Middle East at the Russian
International Affairs Council (Alexey, "Russia looks to the Middle East
to boost arms exports," *Middle East Institute*,
https://www.mei.edu/publications/russia-looks-middle-east-boost-arms-exports)//BB

Therefore, Russia's position in the regional and global arms market is
getting more complicated and difficult given Moscow's declining share of
total exports, decreasing imports in Asia and Oceania, and rising
competition in the Middle East. In addition, [growing U.S. pressure on
Russia via its secondary sanctions puts Moscow in a very challenging
situation that will make it harder to sign big new contracts and
increase its arms exports]{.underline}. [Despite all of these
difficulties Moscow is working hard to get new deals]{.underline}, both
in the Middle East --- the world's fastest-growing and the most
attractive arms market --- and elsewhere, [as part of a broader effort
to maintain its status as a leading arms supplier]{.underline}. However,
[given the geopolitical headwinds and intense competition, maintaining
that status looks like it will be an **increasing challenge** in the
years ahead]{.underline}.

#### Russia's defense industry is struggling because of low arms sales \-\-- ripples through supply-chain

**Borshchevskaya 17** - Senior Fellow at The Washington Institute,
focusing on Russia\'s policy toward the Middle East. She is also a Ph.D.
candidate at George Mason University. In addition, she is a fellow at
the European Foundation for Democracy. (Anna, "The Tactical Side of
Russia's Arms Sales to the Middle East," *Jamestown Foundation*,
https://jamestown.org/program/tactical-side-russias-arms-sales-middle-east/)//BB

Ultimately, [the loss of export opportunities not only complicates
Russia\'s efforts to finance its defense industry, it also reduces the
scale at which the defense industry produces, which]{.underline}, in
turn, [decreases scale-dependent savings that accompany higher levels of
production]{.underline}. In effect, [this means that the more Russia
fails to find foreign customers for]{.underline} specific [weapon
systems, the more it will become burdened with a higher relative cost
per unit]{.underline} as it seeks to meet its own needs. [The conundrum,
in turn, will further limit Russia\'s ability to competitively price
weapons systems for export, thereby perpetuating the
effect]{.underline}. This is why, for example, India\'s withdrawal from
the joint development and production of the Su-57 fighter aircraft last
year has cast doubt on Russia\'s ability to sustain the program in a
meaningful way or at an acceptable cost. As a result, Russia has sought
--- albeit unsuccessfully so far --- to export the Su-57 more widely in
an effort to find a partnership that would make the aircraft viable. The
Search for Solutions [Russia]{.underline}, accordingly, [has been
considering]{.underline} other [solutions to safeguard its defense
sector]{.underline} and improve its overall industrial performance. [One
possible remedy centers on]{.underline} what amounts to burden sharing
across sectors. In this, the country is looking to harness the defense
industry\'s strengths for civilian production, similar to the way
Western enterprises such as Boeing or Airbus operate. By [producing
non-military products]{.underline} for domestic and foreign civilian
markets, Russian defense manufacturers could sustain themselves even if
their military goods are earning less revenue. Russia\'s arms industry
faces an even greater problem in the years to come: reduced
competitiveness. [Unfortunately for Russia, the chances that such a
gambit will succeed are low --- even for domestic
consumption]{.underline}. Although Moscow has been pushing an import
substitution program amid the West\'s sanctions, Russian firms continue
to privilege foreign, instead of domestic, components. In 2018, 38
percent of Russian industrial enterprises purchased equipment from
abroad; two years before, the figure was just 6 percent. Ultimately, if
Russian arms producers are failing to find sales for defense customers
at home, they\'re unlikely to find any more of a domestic civilian
market for their wares. [As a great power, Russia has lofty ambitions
for the modernization of its military.]{.underline} Budget constraints,
more [competition from elsewhere]{.underline} and other issues, however,
[mean many of the army\'s most ostentatious projects never make it past
the showroom]{.underline}. And [moving forward, the Russian defense
industry\'s plight is unlikely to improve as it faces a vicious circle
that is leaving it worse for wear]{.underline}.

### U -- econ

#### Russian expansionism is limited now because of insufficient economic resources

**Muraviev 18** -- Associate Professor of National Security and
Strategic Studies, Curtin University (Alexey, "Russia not so much a
(re)rising superpower as a skilled strategic spoiler," *The
Conversation*,

[The Russian defence sector plays its traditional role of both earning
much-needed cash and furthering Russia's geopolitical
agenda]{.underline}. In 2017, Russian arms exports were worth US\$17
billion, while the total portfolio of foreign orders of Russian
armaments and military equipment is about US\$45 billion, effectively
retaining the number-two position in global arms sales. Still, **[Russia
has no means of global economic expansionism]{.underline}**. [It is
**desperately** seeking new economic opportunities and partnerships with
other countries that do not want all the power focused on the
US]{.underline}. This gives China a strategic lead because of its
diversified extensive economic partnerships with the US, Europe and
Asia. Yet it would be premature to crown China as the sole superpower
rival to the US. Unlike Russia, China clearly lacks political and
diplomatic experience -- the ability to play complex games on a global
chessboard. As an incoming superpower with global ambitions but limited
experience in great power politics, China studies carefully the Soviet
and Russian experiences and leaves Russia to fight all the major fights
at international forums. North Korea and the South China Sea are among
the few exceptions where the Chinese show strategic activism. Apart from
its extensive diplomatic experience, China also needs Russia's strategic
nuclear and conventional military might. [Under Putin, the Russian
military managed to close the capability gap with the most advanced
Western militaries and transformed itself from a large, under-equipped
and understaffed army into an effective, highly motivated and
battle-hardened force]{.underline}. [Putin has given the
once-cash-strapped military machine a massive financial boost -- and,
more importantly, full political support]{.underline}. Between 2013 and
2017, Russia landed in the world's top-three nations on defence
expenditure, just behind the US and China. In Europe, Russia has
remained the single largest defence spender and buyer of major combat
systems. From 2012 until early 2017, the Russian military received
30,000 new and upgraded armaments and items of heavy military equipment.
The Syria campaign and Russia's ability to exercise strategic reach has
once again made the military factor supported by active diplomacy one of
the key determinants of successful realising its national strategic
agenda. In short, [Russia is a major global power in outlook and
reach]{.underline}, locked in a values-based confrontation with the
West. [But it still **lacks all elements of a developed
superpower**]{.underline}.

KEY FINDINGS

[Russia wants to behave as a great power, but]{.underline} under its
current leadership [it is sensitive to its economic capacity to do
so.]{.underline} [There are serious restraints]{.underline}, resistant
to policy action, [that limit its economic capacity]{.underline}. While
[the West]{.underline} has no determining influence over the Russian
economy, it [does have the capacity to raise the economic cost to Russia
of inappropriate great power behaviour, and should do so]{.underline}.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

[Russia wants to be recognised as a great power]{.underline}, and has
sufficient economic power and potential to encourage it to behave
accordingly. [However, under its current leadership it recognises that
there are economic limits to its behaviour]{.underline}. [There is a
consistent commitment to budget discipline and a measured allocation of
resources]{.underline} among key claimants --- the social and
development sectors, as well as defence and security. [That limits the
allocation of resources to power projection]{.underline}, [particularly
of the hard variety]{.underline}, even if such allocation is at a level
high enough to cause considerable discomfort in the West. The Russian
economy is subject to particular pressures: stagnant growth even before
the 2014 fall in oil prices, and the budgetary and investment challenges
of lower oil prices and sanctions. The commitment to budget discipline
and a measured allocation of resources has been maintained. However,
there has also been a major rhetorical and policy shift towards a more
'securitised' economy, including import substitution-led industry
policy. There are major features of the Russian environment which
threaten the success of such a policy shift, but which are highly
resistant to policy action. They include much discussed institutional
weaknesses, as well as issues of remoteness, climate, market size, and
industrial location that make it difficult for Russian industry to be
globally competitive. [The West]{.underline} has no determining
influence over the Russian economy. But it [is able to raise the costs
of great power behaviour, through reducing access to
investment]{.underline} and technology, [and should do so]{.underline}.
INTRODUCTION In recent years, [Russia has re-entered the geostrategic
calculations of the West in ways reminiscent of the Cold
War]{.underline}. Russia's actions in Ukraine and Syria and the rhetoric
of President Vladimir Putin, among other things, are symptomatic of this
renewed assertiveness, but they do not explain it. There is no question
that much of this assertiveness can be attributed to the personality of
Putin himself as well as the Russian nationalism that the president has
both fed and fed off. Nevertheless, it does not seem coincidental that
[Russia reasserted itself during a period of rapid economic growth in
the first 15 years of Putin's rule]{.underline}. [This raises the
question of whether Russia can afford to be the great power it clearly
aspires to be]{.underline}. [Russia's desire to be a great power poses a
challenge to Western policymakers. There is, however, a spectrum of
'greatness' along which Russia can place itself]{.underline}. [Although
Russia will attempt to situate itself **as far along the spectrum as it
can afford**, at present it is placed quite modestly]{.underline}. [Its
economic autonomy is tenuous]{.underline}, in terms of policy commitment
and reality. [Its control over its claimed sphere of influence is
limited]{.underline}, certainly when compared to Soviet and even Tsarist
times. [And its activities in the far abroad are limited in scope and
nature]{.underline}. [Russia's position]{.underline} along the spectrum
of greatness [is **predominantly** a matter of economic
capacity]{.underline}. Its economy is not without heft, ranking No 6 in
the world by size (2015 GDP, purchasing power parity).\[1\] Given that
the prosperity of the population is seen by Russia as part of its great
power status, income is as important as the total size of the economy.
However, Russia is still classified by the World Bank as an upper
middle-income country, a category that contains 56 countries ranging
from Albania to Venezuela.\[2\] As this Analysis will show, Russia's
ability to escape this category is likely to be limited. A mismatch
between expectations and economic capacity presents Western policymakers
concerned by recent Russian behaviour with some interesting policy
choices.

### U -- Recapitalization Incentive Program

#### The US will expand the Recapitalization Incentive Program, or *[RIP]{.underline}*, now to poach Russian clients \-\-- eats away at their market share

**Weisgerber** 5-16-20**19** - global business editor for Defense One,
where he writes about the intersection of business and national
security. He has been covering defense and national security issues for
more than a decade, previously as Pentagon correspondent for Defense
News (Marcus, "US: We'll Pay Countries to Ditch Russian, Chinese Arms,"
*Defense One*,
https://www.defenseone.com/business/2019/05/us-countries-well-pay-you-ditch-russian-chinese-arms/157084/)//BB

The State Department wants to go global with a program originally aimed
at ex-Warsaw Pact members. [The U.S. State Department wants to expand
a]{.underline} little-known [effort that offers countries cash to buy
American-made weapons if they give up Russian-made arms]{.underline}.
[The year-old initiative]{.underline}, called the European
Recapitalization Incentive Program, [is already helping six eastern
European countries buy new helicopters or armored vehicles. Now, State
Department officials are looking to take the effort global to get allies
and partners to abandon]{.underline} not only [Russian
weapons]{.underline}, but Chinese ones too. "[The goal is to help our
partners break away from the Russian supply chain]{.underline} \[and\]
logistics chain that allows Russian contractors and service personnel
and Russian-manufactured spare parts onto either NATO allied bases or
partner military bases," a State Department official said this week.
[The effort comes at a time]{.underline} as military officials across
the Potomac River at the Pentagon talk [about great power competition
between the U.S. and Russia]{.underline} and China. [To get the money,
countries must get rid of their Russian weapons, promise not to buy new
ones, and commit some of their own funding to buying
American]{.underline}. "[It's meant to incentivize partners and allies
to put in their own funds to modernize their military and divest Russian
legacy equipment]{.underline}," the State Department official said. "The
idea being, we can put in some U.S. grant military assistance. They
would then put in some amount of partner military \[funding\]." The idea
is to start the foreign country toward buying a substantial number of
whatever weapons are needed. "We're going to build at least an initial
amount," the official said. "We're not just going to buy them one
helicopter or two infantry fighting vehicles." The American cash flows
through a Foreign Military Financing account. "We're not using U.S.
taxpayer money to completely buy this for a partner," the official said.
"This is going in with our partner together to build an overarching
capability." The countries already approved for funding have militaries
that use Soviet-era helicopters and infantry fighting vehicles,
according to the International Institute of Strategic Studies' Military
Balance. In some cases, if a country buys parts for these vehicles and
helicopters, they could face U.S. sanctions. Since the program began
about a year ago, the State Department has pledged \$190 million for six
projects in six countries. The countries are in different stages of
buying the new equipment and State Department officials believe it could
take a few years until the partner nations are able to move ahead with
the purchases. The countries include: Albania, \$30 million for
helicopters Bosnia, \$30.6 million for helicopters Croatia, \$25 million
for infantry fighting vehicles Greece, \$25 million for infantry
fighting vehicles North Macedonia, \$30 million for infantry fighting
vehicles Slovakia, \$50 million for helicopters The Macedonian
government touted the effort as "strengthening the capacities" of its
army by improving its equipment and bringing it in line with NATO
standards. State is looking at a second round of initiatives with
potential for \$50 to \$100 million for new projects, the official said.
Even though the effort is still considered in a pilot or test phase,
[the State Department's fiscal 2020 budget proposal calls for expanding
the effort. U.S. officials are also looking at how to expand the
initiative beyond Eastern Europe "to compete against Russia]{.underline}
and China [and help our partners get away or stay away from
Russian]{.underline} or Chinese [equipment]{.underline}." While
[State]{.underline} has not yet identified countries outside of Europe,
it['s]{.underline} [exploring countries in Central Asia, Southeast Asia
and Africa]{.underline}.

#### Peeling off [even a few]{.underline} clients collapses the Russian defense-industrial-base [absent new markets]{.underline}

Thanks to its large domestic consumption and numerous export deals, the
United States is shielded from dependence on and demands by its clients
in ways undreamed of by any other arms exporter. [Other
weapons-exporting countries rely on relatively fewer
buyers]{.underline}, which means they enjoy less influence over clients,
feel more pressure to transfer technology, and engage in more corruption
to make sales. In his definitive book on the global arms trade, Keith
Krause lays out the consequence of these forces on "[second-tier
producers,]{.underline}" which "are much more prone to sacrifice or
dilute their technological lead in order to maintain their productive
base, and [are]{.underline} much more [reliant upon export
opportunities]{.underline}. They are therefore less likely to demand
end-use restrictions, and hence reliance may not translate into
dependence." Unsurprisingly, [the United States has the most diverse
export portfolio in the world]{.underline}. Its two biggest customers,
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, account for 13 percent and 9
percent of all U.S. arms deliveries since 2012, respectively. Another
thirteen heterogeneous states account for 3-6 percent each. More
surprisingly, [Russia, despite being the second largest global supplier
of weapons, sells weapons to a **very small** group of
buyers]{.underline}. For example, 39 percent of its exports go to India,
and 11 percent each go to Vietnam and China. Similarly, China sends 63
percent of its arms exports to only three countries: Pakistan,
Bangladesh, and Myanmar. **[A shift of]{.underline}** any **[one
country]{.underline}** [away]{.underline} [from]{.underline} Chinese or
[Russian imports would be devastating for its]{.underline} respective
[industry]{.underline}, leaving buyers largely in the driver's seat,
demanding lower prices, more bribes, and larger technology transfer. In
contrast, European suppliers have a relatively diverse group of client
states, if not quite as broad as the United States. That said, nearly
half of recent British exports have gone to Saudi Arabia.

### U -- brink

#### The viability of Russian defense exports is on the brink

**Denisenetsev 17** -- Visiting Fellow @ CSIS (Sergey, "Russia in the
Global Arms Market," CSIS,
<https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/170816_Denisentsev_RussiaGlobalArmsMarket_Web.pdf?VHDgCY.h54QWJm1lPCa2w1Lc.BjElJH)//BB>

[Numerous]{.underline} other [factors have contributed to the decline of
Russian arms exports]{.underline}: • Growing [competition]{.underline}
and the emergence of new arms exporters. Several countries--- especially
China and South Korea, and to a lesser extent South Africa, Turkey, and
Singapore---have increased their arms exports in recent years, reducing
the market share of Russian suppliers. Additionally, the World Trade
Organization has had an indirect impact on the global arms market. WTO
rules have limited the ability of national governments to provide direct
stimulus measures to certain industries and exports, but these rules do
not apply to the arms market because of national security implications.
This is why many governments use subsidies and encourage \"dumping\" on
the weapons market in order to increase their exports. China also
regards arms supplies as instruments of political influence, so Chinese
weapons are frequently offered to African, Asian, and Latin American
buyers at discounted prices as part of a broader Chinese expansion
policy. • • [Falling oil prices]{.underline}. The price of Brent crude
collapsed from \$113 per barrel in the summer of 2014 to \$28 in late
2015.45 This has clearly crippled the ability of Russian defense
customers such as Algeria, Azerbaijan, and Iraq to finance their
imports. Oil prices have recently recovered to \$48---S50 per barrel;
however, they are not expected to rise by much in the near future,
thereby putting a cap on procurement programs in petro- states. Also
worth mentioning is the crisis of the Bolivarian project in Venezuela,
though this was mostly caused by falling oil prices. The collapse of
Libya and the subsequent loss of a \$7 billion defense contract package,
of which \$2 billion worth of contracts had already been signed.46 The
Syrian Civil War. The [sanctions]{.underline} on Iran. Western sanctions
on Russia itself. Russian companies that have been targeted by sanctions
are finding it more difficult to attract credit financing and upgrade
production facilities. It should be noted, however, that the overall
impact of sanctions on Russia\'s arms export programs is not large.47
Yet another factor undermining Russian arms exports is increased
domestic demand for Russian weapons systems. Figure 8 shows Russian arms
exports and domestic defense procurement since 2003. Evidently, orders
placed by Russia\'s own Ministry of Defense (MoD) began to grow rapidly
after the adoption of State Armament Program 2020. As a result of this
growth, [many suppliers have lost their production capacity]{.underline}
and have had to prioritize domestic contracts over export deliveries.
For example, orders placed by the Russian MOD for the S-400 SAM systems
will keep their supplier working until at least 2019, 48 thereby
severely restricting the supplier\'s ability to serve export customers
that are unwilling to wait until 2020. Also, for many weapons systems,
[Russian production capacity has shrunk]{.underline} as a result of the
economic crisis, reforms, and privatizations in the 1990s. In addition
to financial constraints, the SAP-2020 program is facing diminished
production capacity and shortages of qualified defense industrial
specialists. [A combination of all these factors has brought Russian
defense exports to the **brink** of crisis]{.underline}.

### U -- AT allies diversifying to Russia now

#### Sanctions are squeezing Russians arms sales to US allies now

**Thompson 18** -- Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and
International Security (Andrea, "The State of Arms Control with Russia,"
*Statement for the Record Testimony before the Senate Committee on
Foreign Relations*, Lexis)//BB

I would also note that [our sanctions policy is an important element in
maintaining pressure on Moscow to abandon its malign
activities]{.underline}, and that Section 231 of the Countering
America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act of 2017, or CAATSA, is an
important tool in our sanctions toolkit and in our strategic competition
with Russia. [Arms sales are not only an important source of revenue for
Moscow, but also a means of maintaining or growing its political and
military influence around the world]{.underline}. [Ending those sales
not only applies pressure to Russia to change its behavior, but also
helps to curb Russia's access in places where it seeks to maintain or
forge such ties]{.underline}. By mandating sanctions on those who are
engaging in significant transactions with Russia's defense and
intelligence sectors, [CAATSA provides us with leverage in working with
our partners and allied states, so that they reduce their military ties
to Russia, a country that has become an increasingly unreliable and
risky security partner]{.underline}. Thus far, we assess that [our
global campaign]{.underline} to implement CAATSA [has denied Russia's
defense sector several billion dollars in lost sales as states abandon
pending arms deals with Moscow]{.underline}. The Department of State
remains committed to the ongoing full implementation of CAATSA Section
231, including through the imposition of sanctions as appropriate.

### U -- AT Pakistan

#### The Russia-Pakistan deal is [incomplete]{.underline} \-\-- if it does go through it's a [net loss]{.underline} because of a loss of Indian sales

Dangerous Game," *The Diplomat*,
<https://thediplomat.com/2019/05/russias-looming-arms-sale-to-pakistan-sets-up-a-dangerous-game/)//BB>

[On the heels of the recent tensions between New Delhi and Islamabad,
news broke out that Pakistan is set to purchase]{.underline} the Pantsir
[surface-to-air missile system and T-90 tanks from Russia]{.underline}.
[If true, this deal would be Russian industry's biggest ever in its
(to-date minuscule) arms trade with Pakistan]{.underline} and would have
the potential to shift the balance of Moscow's relations with the two
South Asian neighbors and rivals. [One should be **very careful** with
jumping to conclusions on such deals, however]{.underline}. [First, the
media narrative often presents such agreements as if they were destined
to be finalized, ignoring the complex reality of
negotiations]{.underline}. [In the media, memoranda of understanding may
be confused with final deals, and any stage of talks can be presented as
if the ink was already drying down on the paper]{.underline}. In this
case, [the]{.underline} Times of Islamabad [story]{.underline} actually
[mentioned that Islamabad "is now planning to send a delegation to
Moscow to finalize the deal]{.underline}" --- and [an awful lot of deals
have died on the way to finalization, often after years of protracted
and delayed negotiations]{.underline}. As for the [tanks, the news is
that "Pakistan has drawn up a plan to also procure 360 T-90 tanks" from
Russia; there is an **even longer and torturous way** from here to
getting the tanks rolling on the plains of Punjab or Sindh by Pakistan's
border with India]{.underline}. But [there is a second reason to watch
these developments with both an attentive eye and a cool
head]{.underline}. [Such a purchase would cause a small political
earthquake, and its epicenter would be located in India. By allowing its
companies to sell so much weaponry to Islamabad, Moscow would
**jeopardize its**]{.underline} already decreasing **[arms trade
with]{.underline}** its traditional South Asian client: **[New
Delhi]{.underline}**. The Soviet Union, and later the Russian
Federation, kept a strict policy of not selling weapons to Pakistan,
while remaining India's close political partner and selling a lot of
military hardware to New Delhi. This, however, changed beginning in
2014, when Moscow and Islamabad signed an agreement to cooperate in the
area of defense. The deal paved the way for the first-ever purchase of
Russian military equipment by Pakistan: in 2015, the parties agreed that
Islamabad would buy Mi-35M attack helicopters. A lot of eyebrows were
raised in New Delhi, and Russia's clear position on the side of India
was not so obvious anymore. The further purchase of Russian Mi-171E
helicopters attracted less attention but possibly had a significance of
its own. The aircraft were supposed to be of the civilian variant and
destined to be used by the government of the province of Balochistan,
and yet were reportedly used for night vision missions during the
anti-terrorist Zarb-e-Azb operation. All of this was sided with a
visible rise in a number of bilateral visits (a trend that actually
started in 2012-2013) and a commencement of a series of joint
Russia-Pakistan military exercises. And yet so far the numbers are not
astonishing. Russia has actually sold four Mi-35Ms and a few Mi-171Es to
Pakistan. This cooperation is important politically, but constitutes a
drop in the roaring rivers of international arms trade. [I would doubt
if Moscow could suddenly jump from this level to providing hundreds of
tanks to Pakistan without anybody blinking]{.underline}; every large
military deal requires a lot of political backing and maneuvering. The
deals do suggest certain policy changes, however, and a growth of
multilateral attitudes on all sides. On one side there are Russians,
whose overall export options are in fact very limited (and were further
reduced in wake of sanctions that followed Moscow's brutal interference
in Ukraine). Military technology is actually one of the very few areas
where Russia has much to export on offer, and the countries of the
Middle East and Asia remain primary buyers. On the other side there is
Islamabad, for which a limited number of choices on the international
scene is a permanent situation. Pakistan's love-hate relationship with
United States, in which both countries seem to be more forced than
willing to cooperate, got even more cold and complicated ever since
Osama bin Laden was found to be living in Abbottabad. This and a host of
other factors led to a gradual decrease of U.S. financial aid to
Pakistan ever since. For Islamabad, in view of its increasingly troubled
relations with Washington and its already-visible overdependence on
Beijing, it would be natural to at attempt at least some, however
limited, cooperation with Russia. Some have already speculated that
South Asia is heading into a global alliance swap: India would become
the United States' primary partner (including in military affairs),
while Pakistan would side with Russia. But let's face it: the selling of
a handful of helicopters amounts neither to Russia's scoring a
meaningful victory in its attempts to prop up exports nor to Pakistan's
changing its main global partner. The real center of gravity in
Moscow-Islamabad relations lies in New Delhi. It is the growing
cooperation between India and the United States in the area of defense,
I believe, that prompted the Russians to initiate this kind of
cooperation with Pakistan. The signing of a few major Indo-American
agreements of cooperation in defense (such as LEMOA) and a few
big-tickets purchases of American hardware by India (such as the Apache
and Chinook helicopters) caused anxiety and anger in Russia. This was
coupled with a decrease in Moscow's military exports to India and, with
it, Russian companies losing some of the key bids to American, French,
and Israeli competition (Rosoboronexport's Komardin was heard fuming
about this). It is in these circumstances, I think, that Russia decided
to start cooperating with Pakistan in security-related issues. And yet
one additional obvious observation is that [India is simply a bigger
market than Pakistan. It does not make sense for Russia to swap this
market for Pakistan]{.underline}; the trick would be then in either
having both markets open to oneself or retaining a considerable chunk of
the Indian market. New Delhi lately often chose more advanced military
technology when it could, and hence Russian products are less in demand
there than they used to be. Yet, many have competitive prices and some
are technologically still very attractive, not only for poorer states.
The Indo-Russian arms trade still has a lot of potential, and the recent
deals and negotiations between Moscow and New Delhi attest to this (the
recent agreement to sell the S-400 system to India is the best, if
special, example of this).

### U -- AT China

#### Russian sales to China will decline now

[From a distance, Putin's recent large contracts of Russia's most modern
platforms would appear to indicate a positive outlook on future
Sino-Russian military-technical cooperation. However,]{.underline} as
Sukhankin surmises: Selling \[arms\] to China might provide the
struggling Russian economy with a much-needed injection of funds and the
Kremlin with illusory hopes for political support from Beijing. But [the
excited rhetoric regarding these arms sales obscures important negative
trends that Moscow has been ignoring]{.underline}.252 [Specifically,
China's ongoing development of its MIC, rising Chinese arms exports,
Russian arms sales to Beijing's geopolitical competitors, and underlying
Sino-Russian strategic contradictions contribute to the continued
reduction of Moscow's arms sales to Beijing]{.underline}. Due to the
increased capabilities of the Chinese MIC, Beijing no longer entertains
Russian offers to import older systems, but instead demands the most
modern platforms.253 While Russia can still count on Beijing's needs for
niche technologies like aircraft engines and advanced air defense
platforms, [Beijing's wish list of Russian equipment is rapidly
dwindling]{.underline}. As Figure 6 displays, China's imports of Russian
equipment have changed from a wide variety of military equipment
to---with the exception of transport helicopters--- mostly subsystems
needed to outfit domestically-produced equipment. Such changes have also
decreased Russia's share of Chinese imports and, reciprocally, China's
percentage of Russian exports, as Figures 7 and 8 depict. Ultimately, as
Matthew Bodner states, "[Russia has a very limited catalogue of military
hardware that it can sell to Beijing at this point\...Russia has already
sold most everything else]{.underline}."254 Thus, without continued
Russian modernization of its defense industry and development of newer
and more technologically advanced weapons systems, **[Russian arms sales
to Beijing will continue to decrease.]{.underline}** Unsurprisingly, one
of China's objectives in developing it owns defense industry has
remained reducing its dependence on other states, like Russia.258 With
that decrease of dependence on Russian equipment, the potential for
Moscow to leverage arms sales for political or economic benefits also
declines. Such a future outlook, especially in a period of economic
sanctions and continued negative relations with the West, is troubling
for Moscow. China's defense industry has also demonstrated its ability
to adapt to changing circumstances. Unlike Russia's MIC, which requires
massive, top-down oversight to ensure its survival, the Chinese MIC has
continually dealt with changing circumstances and government
requirements with bottom-up solutions.259 Recently, the CCP has created
multiple new initiatives to boost innovation and emerging technology
development through "marketizing" several defense industries.260 Such
[flexibility in the Chinese arms industry bodes well for its future
success and its greater independence from Russian arms]{.underline}.

[India's ongoing attempts to create a domestic MIC]{.underline} also
[**foreshadow a future decrease** in Russian arms sales to
India]{.underline}. New Delhi's first inclinations for self-sufficiency
occurred during the 1990s as Russia slowly retreated from its
international commitments to deal with internal economic issues. The
aforementioned [technical issues with Russian arms imports and slow
response times in procuring repair parts further motivated New Delhi's
attempts at MIC self-sufficiency]{.underline}. Reporting by the
Jamestown Foundation in 1997 stated that "[Indian officials have
reportedly indicated their unease over possible delays in Russia's
export of parts for its military hardware \[and\] suggested that, for
this reason, India is pursuing a policy of self-sufficiency in arms
production]{.underline} that will be based in part on acquiring licenses
to produce Russian weaponry at home."479 India was true to its word.
[Beginning in the late 1990s, larger Russian sales of aircraft and tanks
all included a portion of the transferred equipment marked for domestic
assembly under licensed production agreements]{.underline}.

#### India won't buy from Russia in the future

While [India's domestic production]{.underline} capabilities might take
a long time to build platforms that can compete with Russian equipment,
external competition [immediately]{.underline} [threatens Russia's
domination of India's arms import market]{.underline}. As Stephen Blank
summarizes, "The trend that Russia now faces---of ever greater
competition from other producers---will not be reversed\...[India will
continue to diversify its defense imports]{.underline}."489 Unlike in
China, where Beijing is constructing a highly capable domestic MIC that
challenges Russia's market share, Western countries---such as the United
States, France, and Israel---are the Russian's main competitors for
Indian contracts. [Multiple factors paint a pessimistic picture of
Russia's ability to maintain its dominant claim of the India arms
market.]{.underline} As mentioned previously[, India has had a choice
between vendors since the cancellation of arms embargos following its
1998 nuclear tests.]{.underline}490 Russia's ongoing technical problems
with several of its imported platforms---namely MBTs, aircraft,
submarines, and the Admiral Gorshkov---foment New Delhi's discontent.491
Russia also lacks a competitive advantage over the more inventive and
financially stable Western countries. With Russia's economy declining
and innovative capacity waning, Western countries provide India a better
source of potential technology transfers and defensive production
indigenization, all of which are key factors for India's long-term
strategic MIC goals.492 Current Western sanctions only further impair
Russia's MIC and ability to produce technologically advanced
equipment.493 As such, the Indians certain have several motivations to
look elsewhere for arms vendors. Geopolitical factors also stimulate
India's desire to diversify its arms sales. While Russia's desire for
suzerainty might shade its view of India and consider it a de facto
tributary state, India does not reciprocate such a perspective. Neither
does New Delhi feel that its relationship with Moscow is mutually
exclusive. As Indian Defence Minister George Fernandes said in 2002
during a visit by General Michael Myers, the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, "We are working together \[with both\], and I don't
think there is any conflict of interest between our relations with the
United States and our relations with Russia."494 Furthermore, as Indian
worry rises with China's continual economic growth and military
expenditure increases, [New Delhi will ultimately trust Washington
more]{.underline} to balance China, not Russia, who depends on Beijing
to join in its crusade against American hegemony[. For India, the United
States and its various allies certainly appear as more preferred
partners]{.underline}.

Fourth, [Russia is likely to continue to be seen as a reliable source of
weapons for countries that do not enjoy warm relations with the
US]{.underline}. This means that a wider range of countries are
potential markets for Russian exporters, in contrast with the situation
facing some of their Western competitors. [Russian armaments
producers]{.underline} have the opportunity to **[exploit]{.underline}**
the [**tensions**]{.underline} that exist [between the US and
countries]{.underline} such as Iran, China or Syria, and also those
[that]{.underline} may emerge in countries that
[traditionally]{.underline} [source their weapons from the
US]{.underline}, such as Turkey, Egypt or the Philippines.

The effect of U.S. market power is not absolute and is likely only to
delay the spread of weapons. [As the Egyptian case
demonstrates]{.underline}, [when the United States restricts weapons to
punish what it considers bad behavior, **other countries**]{.underline}
can [**fill the gap**.]{.underline} [The recent removal of many
technologies from the United States Munitions List]{.underline}---a
roster of products subject to controls under the Arms Export Control Act
of 1976---[was driven in part by the American arms industry convincing
the government that it is losing competitive advantage
abroad.]{.underline} Consequently, many weapons transfers may no longer
be subject to rigorous human rights vetting and end-use monitoring by
the State Department. [Eroding American market dominance of higher-end
weapons makes it less likely that the United States will continue to
exercise its traditional policy of "unilateral restraint" in their
sale]{.underline}.

US aid freeze," Lexis)//BB

[Egypt is looking to Russia to supply it with arms now that the US has
frozen much of its military aid to the Egyptians]{.underline}, Israeli
television reported Friday night. The "historic achievement," under
which the US brought Egypt into its orbit in the years since the 1979
Camp David Israel-Egypt peace treaty, is about to "go down the drain,"
the Channel 2 report said. It referred to comments earlier this week by
[Egypt's Foreign Minister]{.underline} Nabil Fahmy, [who said ties
between Cairo and Washington were in "turmoil" and told CNN that Egypt
would have to "find other sources" to meet its national security
needs]{.underline}. By "other sources," said the TV report, [Fahmy was
referring to Russia, with whom Egypt was now looking to conclude a major
arms deal.]{.underline} This would represent a major change of
orientation for Egypt, since its entire army had been built on US
equipment for the past three decades. The news came four days after
reports that Israel had argued "directly and bluntly" with the Obama
administration against US aid cuts to Egypt, telling
[Washington]{.underline} it [was making "a strategic error" in reducing
financial assistance to Cairo]{.underline} in the wake of the military's
ouster of president Mohammed Morsi.

Even in those Asian countries that do not account for a large share of
Russian exports, such as Myanmar, Turkmenistan and Mongolia,
[Russia]{.underline} is often the primary or a prominent source of arms
supplies. In recent years, it [has attempted to enter markets
traditionally dominated by other powers]{.underline}. For example,
efforts to increase sales to Pakistan, traditionally supplied by China
and the US, are beginning to bear fruit.30 Indonesia has tended to
purchase weaponry from European countries, but Russia has also made
inroads into that market and accounted for over 20 per cent of
Indonesian arms imports in 2000--16. Indonesia is now being targeted by
Russia as a potential purchaser of Su-35 aircraft and Varshavyanka-class
submarines.31 [Russia]{.underline} [is]{.underline} also [targeting
countries that have traditionally sourced armaments from the
US]{.underline}. Recently, [it has shown a willingness to
**exploit**]{.underline} the **[deterioration]{.underline}**

Though [its foreign actions are]{.underline} often [opportunistic,
Russia increasingly aims to create a multipolar world in which it plays
a more prominent role]{.underline}. Moscow's national security
establishment broadly supports this international outreach, which will
likely remain an enduring feature of Russian foreign policy. Washington
and its allies must carefully judge Russian actions case by case and
respond in concert when possible. THE KREMLIN'S INTERNATIONAL AGENDA
[Moscow has relied on relatively inexpensive]{.underline} diplomatic,
military, intelligence, cyber, trade, energy, and financial [tools to
wield influence and expand its global footprint]{.underline}. **[The
Kremlin has capitalized on Western missteps]{.underline}** and growing
anti-establishment sentiments in Europe and North America. [Russia will
likely continue trying to fill]{.underline} global [power vacuums
resulting from]{.underline} U.S. President Donald [Trump's]{.underline}
"America First" foreign [policy]{.underline}. IMPLICATIONS FOR U.S.
FOREIGN POLICY Formulating an effective response to Russia's global
activism will be challenging. To do so, U.S. policymakers should
consider four broad points: Ask the first-order question. How do
Russia's actions affect U.S. interests and foreign policy goals? In some
areas, Russian activities have damaged U.S. interests, but elsewhere
their impact has been symbolic rather than substantive. Russian activity
should not be conflated with Russian success. Weigh costs and benefits.
Russia's approach has had mixed results. Its investments in the Middle
East have paid off handsomely. But in Europe, Russian actions have
mobilized Western governments to counter them. Notably, Moscow has fewer
resources than the West, serious domestic problems, and no real allies.
Avoid overreacting. Not every instance of Russian activism threatens the
U.S.-led international order or U.S. security. At a minimum, Washington
and its allies should expose Moscow's tactics. More robust responses are
justified when important U.S. and allied interests are threatened---and
when Washington has realistic, sustainable means to thwart Moscow's
ambitions without exacerbating the situation. Leverage partnerships and
eschew a one-size-fits-all approach. There is no cookie-cutter solution
for countering Russian adventurism. Washington need not bear this burden
alone; it should develop tailored strategies with other actors to deter,
contain, and, if necessary, roll back Russian influence operations.
INTRODUCTION For much of the post--Cold War era, the United States and
Europe paid little attention to Russia's efforts to expand its
political, economic, and military influence abroad. The West saw these
efforts as relics of the Cold War, primarily confined to Russia's
immediate neighborhood but largely absent or at least ineffective
elsewhere. The effects of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia's
internal challenges, and Moscow's stated desire for integration with the
West sharply constrained the Kremlin's interest and capacity to project
its influence on a global scale and diminished the West's interest in
Russian foreign policy and its global activities. However, since
Vladimir Putin returned to the Russian presidency in 2012 after a
four-year stint as prime minister, Russia has engaged in a broad,
sophisticated, well-resourced, and---to many observers---surprisingly
effective campaign to expand its global reach. To advance its diverse
objectives, Moscow has relied on a wide array of diplomatic, military,
intelligence, cyber, trade, energy, and financial tools to influence
political systems, public attitudes, and elite decisionmakers in Europe,
the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. These objectives
include, first and foremost, undermining the U.S.-led liberal
international order and the cohesion of the West; enhancing Putin's
domestic legitimacy by demonstrating Russia's status as a global
superpower; promoting specific Russian commercial, military, and energy
interests; and tweaking the United States' nose in areas of traditional
U.S. influence. Russia has engaged in a broad, sophisticated,
well-resourced, and---to many observers---surprisingly effective
campaign to expand its global reach. The Kremlin launched this campaign
in response to the 2012 mass protests in Moscow, apparently convinced
that Western democracy promotion initiatives had instigated these
demonstrations to destabilize Russia itself and promote regime change.1
In 2014, following Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and the start
of its undeclared war in Ukraine, this counteroffensive intensified and
took on new qualities. Whereas previously the bulk of Russian efforts
had focused on defending Moscow's claimed "sphere of privileged
interests" around its periphery, the new campaign has sought to damage
the international image of Western democracy, exacerbate the internal
tensions within Western political and security institutions, and expand
Russia's global reach at the expense of Washington and its allies by
playing on Western missteps in different parts of the world. [For the
first time since the breakup of the Soviet Union, the United States is
facing a]{.underline} [Russia]{.underline} that is not, in former
president Barack Obama's memorable phrase, a mere "regional power," but
rather one [that is actively trying to project its influence and
establish a presence well beyond its periphery]{.underline}.2 Despite
Moscow's shift in strategy, the United States and its European partners
are increasingly focused on their own domestic challenges and regional
crises in Asia and the Middle East. [Russia is keen to **exploit**
increased opportunities in the]{.underline} resulting
**[vacuum]{.underline}**, using both hard and soft power, [to expand its
influence and presence and to take advantage of]{.underline} Donald
Trump's presidency, marked by his embrace of an "America First" foreign
policy and:3 [a retreat from]{.underline} long-established [U.S.
leadership]{.underline} in upholding the rules-based international order
Washington helped create after World War II; an abandonment of democracy
promotion and rule of law as elements of U.S. foreign policy; a return
to isolationism and a rejection of nation-building efforts to redirect
U.S. resources needed at home; a dismissal of multilateral cooperation
and a devaluation of long-standing U.S. alliances; the worst domestic
political crisis in the United States in many decades; and, most
importantly, a refusal to acknowledge the challenge posed by Russian
adventurism. [Finding examples of Russian global activism is
easy]{.underline}. Assessing its motivations, consequences, and
effectiveness is not. Specifically, it can be hard to tell whether a
given Russian behavior is meant to actively undermine the liberal
political and economic order that has flourished under U.S. leadership
or whether it is designed primarily to shore up Putin's domestic
standing and to create timely economic opportunities for domestic
Russian constituencies that support his regime. Likewise, framing a
coherent and effective U.S. response to Russia's increased global
activism will be challenging. The risk of doing too much or too little
is real, and getting the answer right entails asking a series of
challenging questions. Is Moscow's behavior largely symbolic or does it
threaten the interests of the United States or its closest allies? What
is the cost to U.S. interests of Russia's efforts to gain geopolitical
and economic toeholds beyond its immediate neighborhood? When should
Russian actions trigger a strong U.S. response? Which Russian activities
may risk overreach and pushback? What are the best ways to measure the
impact---both in Russia and the West---of Moscow's recent global
activism? Finding examples of Russian global activism is easy. Assessing
its motivations, consequences, and effectiveness is not. Identifying the
key drivers of Russia's global activism and providing an overview of
Moscow's many efforts to expand its global influence is a useful and
important way to begin formulating appropriate and effective responses
to these behaviors. In some areas, Russian activities have damaged
Western interests, but in others their impact has proven to be more
symbolic than substantive. Not every far-flung Russian initiative should
be viewed as part of a global zero-sum competition between the United
States and Russia, and the costs to Russia of some of these efforts
could exceed the benefits Moscow hopes to gain. Policymakers should seek
to assess the interests that a given Russian behavior is seeking to
advance, which policy tools Moscow is employing, which U.S. interests
are being undermined, and which U.S. policy tools would constitute the
most effective response. THE WEST AND THE REST Russia's global activism
can be divided into four geographic regions. While there may be some
uncertainty about the drivers at play in each of these regions, there is
little uncertainty about the considerable momentum behind these efforts.
In general, Moscow's ordering of priorities aligns closely with the
proximity of the region to Russia, as well as with Russian threat
perceptions. First are Moscow's efforts to retain its influence or
counter Western influence in the states of the former Soviet Union. In
its immediate periphery, Moscow aims to firm up its hold on its
neighbors to prevent additional countries from aligning too closely with
the West, and to preserve a buffer zone of pro-Russian or, at least,
neutral states around it. In countries that have already turned away
from Russia---Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine---Moscow seeks to undermine
their political transitions, court their publics, and prevent their true
integration with Western political, economic, or security structures.
Moscow also is keen to shore up its influence in Central Asia, a region
increasingly dominated economically by China. The second category
consists of Moscow's efforts to undermine the Western and transatlantic
institutions it considers its principal adversaries---the United States,
the European Union (EU), and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO). Moscow has attempted to exploit their internal divisions and
challenges as well as the uncertainty about Washington's commitment to
its allies and partners since President Donald Trump's embrace of the
"America First" agenda. Moscow's anti-Western actions are motivated by a
widely held view in the Russian security establishment that the
administrations of former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush
actively sought to weaken Russia domestically, undermine its influence
internationally, increase its isolation, and carry out regime change
around Russia's periphery and even in the country itself. Russian
leaders apparently have decided to do to the West what they believe the
West has done to them. Third, Russia is engaging in a campaign to gain
or regain influence in other places where the Soviet Union once held
sway. In the Balkans, for example, Russia plays the nationalist and
Christian Orthodox cards to complicate Western efforts to integrate
these countries into European structures. In the Middle East, Russia
seeks to protect its longstanding equities in Syria and to convey its
purported great power status to domestic and international audiences, as
well as its capacity to act beyond its immediate neighborhood and gain a
foothold in what is seen as a traditionally U.S. sphere of influence.
The final category consists of Russian efforts to gain influence in
parts of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Some of these efforts involve
forming coalitions of rising powers willing to challenge the
Western-dominated international system; elsewhere, [Moscow tries
to]{.underline} cultivate authoritarian leaders and **[take advantage of
frictions between the United States and]{.underline}** some of **[its
traditional allies or partners]{.underline}**. In Latin America, in
particular, Moscow hopes to embarrass Washington and show that it too
can make a foray into its main global adversary's backyard.

### L -- HR conditions

#### The plan causes client states to diversify supply through Russia \-\-- the link alone takes out the case \-\--the US will try, [but fail]{.underline}, to regain market dominance after Russia fill the vacuum

**Rounds 19** -- Ph.D. candidate at Georgetown University in
International Relations (Ray, "THE CASE AGAINST ARMS EMBARGOS, EVEN FOR
SAUDI ARABIA," *War on The Rocks*,
<https://warontherocks.com/2019/04/the-case-against-arms-embargos-even-for-saudi-arabia/)//BB>

One area in which U.S. President Donald Trump does not need to worry
about making America great again is international arms sales. [The
United States accounts for 34 percent of all global arms sales (second
place Russia remains]{.underline} a [distant]{.underline} 23 percent),
and has more than 40 defense companies in the top 100 globally. However,
with civilian deaths caused by the Saudi-led war in Yemen estimated at
between 16,000 and 50,000 by the end of 2018, calls for the United
States to suspend arms sales to its largest client --- Saudi Arabia ---
have understandably gained traction in both Congress and the public.
More generally, [several authors have penned articles]{.underline} in
these virtual pages [calling for more selective U.S. arms export
decisions or outright embargos]{.underline}, governed less by economic
motivations and more by concern about blowback, human rights,
dispersion, and reducing technology transfer. [I]{.underline}
respectfully [disagree]{.underline} with all of these recommendations.
Whether it is delayed approval, as in the recent Kuwaiti F-18 purchase,
an outright embargo, like Egyptian F-16s in 2013, or denial of
technology transfer, as in the 2016 Turkish Patriot missile request,
[using the withholding of arms sales as a blunt force
instrument]{.underline} of coercion [is unlikely to produce desired
strategic benefits and often backfires]{.underline}. [Arms exports are
**best** used for]{.underline} maintaining or strengthening
relationships while [limiting adversary access to client
states]{.underline}; a tool of nuanced influence, not outright coercion.
In fact, [threatening to withhold arms sales to coerce a state into
changing its behavior often has the opposite effect, leading clients to
**diversify their arms sourcing** instead of shifting
course]{.underline}. Similarly, calls to restrict technology transfer
and worries about demands for direct offsets mistake what is known as
"design technology transfer" for the much more difficult "capacity"
level of transfer. Both are explained in more detail below, but for now
it is worth noting that design transfer, the level at which most of
these offsets occur, does not lead to the creation of an independent
defense industry, but instead provides the United States with a source
of political power. The United States should not fear technology
transfer, but with the appropriate end-user controls, encourage it.
Additionally, while a large domestic market provides the United States
the luxury of sacrificing financial gains for political influence,
sometimes economics do matter; especially when it comes to preserving
complex production lines for future flexibility. Finally, the United
States should not look to use an arms embargo to coerce Saudi policy
change, not for economic reasons, but simply because it is unlikely to
work. Greasing the Skids, Not Twisting Arms [Arms sales are
useful]{.underline} tools [for]{.underline} maintaining communication,
strengthening relationships, and [keeping potential adversary states at
bay]{.underline}. Conversely, as a blunt instrument of coercion (i.e. if
you do not do X, we will suspend Y), they are likely losers. [Senior
U.S. government officials involved in the arms transfer process that I
interviewed over the past year during the course of my research have
echoed similar sentiments]{.underline}. [This is also borne out by
previous research]{.underline} providing evidence that using arms
transfers as situationally coercive tools is rarely successful.
Interestingly, [coercion attempts using arms transfers are least likely
to be successful when used as a punishment or threat against an
autocratic regime]{.underline}, such as Saudi Arabia. Instead,
[punishments]{.underline} in the form of an embargo can often [push a
client to **diversify sourcing** rather than to change
behavior]{.underline}. [Consider Indonesia and Egypt]{.underline}. [In
2015, Egypt agreed to purchase]{.underline} nearly 50
[Russian]{.underline} MiG-29M/[M2s]{.underline} and more than two-dozen
French Rafales. This represented a shocking turn of events after more
than three decades of purchasing only American-made fighter jets[. It
was also driven largely by the U.S. embargo]{.underline} put in place in
2013, after the Egyptian army's removal of then-President Mohamed Morsi,
who had won the presidency in a 2012 election. The embargo caused
significant tension between the two states driven by "an Egyptian sense
that they were at a point of mortal peril" while the United States was
moralizing about democratic reforms. Remarkably, [the United States
lifted the embargo in 2015 with virtually no change in Egyptian
policies]{.underline}, no official U.S. "democracy certification", and
Egyptian military support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. The U.S. arms
embargo as a tool of coercive change was an abject failure. [A similar
story played out in Indonesia more than a decade prior. A long-time arms
client of the United States with no history of Russian imports,
Indonesia announced a deal with Russia in 2003 to purchase Russian
Su-27/30s]{.underline}. While Indonesia was always far more politically
neutral than Egypt, this remarkable turnaround in arms sourcing
diversification appears to be the result of a U.S. arms embargo
implemented in 1999 in response to Indonesia's apparent human rights
violations carrying out heavy-handed military actions in East Timor.
Furious at U.S. meddling in something the government considered a
domestic issue, Indonesia looked instead to Russia with the specific
intent to "overcome the effects of \[U.S.\] arms sales restrictions." In
other words, Indonesia looked to diversify, not capitulate. [Indonesia
continued sourcing Russian arms even after the United States lifted the
embargo]{.underline} in 2005. Perhaps most remarkably, even after the
United States agreed to give Indonesia 24 F-16s in 2012, the archipelago
state still agreed to purchase 11 Russian Su-35s. The U.S. attempt at
coercion not only failed but continues to perpetuate negative strategic
effects today. Who's Afraid of Technology Transfer? Another argument for
a more restrictive arms export policy concerns direct industrial offsets
(those economic agreements in which a supplier invests in the industry
of a client state directly related to the arms being transferred) and
technology transfer. However, these tools should not be feared.
Technology transfer is unlikely to breed meaningful competition for the
United States where it matters most, in the medium- to high-end markets,
and instead gives the United States a source of political influence. The
problem in many analyses is confusion over the type of technology
transfer. There are three ideal-typical categories of transfer: material
transfer, such as simple diffusion of weapons and machines; design
transfer, like blueprints and schematics; and capacity transfer, which
involves basic scientific knowledge and expertise within the industrial
base. Most technology transfers ultimately fall into the first two
categories, despite what a client state might hope for. Consider the
2003 Polish decision to purchase F-16s from Lockheed Martin with direct
offsets valued at more than \$6 billion. This represented 170 percent of
the program value and the then-largest in commercial history. Despite
this massive investment, Poland does not design and produce their own
fighter jets today, but rather subsections of American-designed systems
under license. In fact, direct offsets provided inroads for U.S.
industry in the Polish defense industry in a manner that strongly
incentivizes the Poles to continue purchasing U.S. aircraft, and indeed
Poland appears poised to purchase the F-35 in the near future. Offsets
and technology transfer may have helped revive portions of the Polish
defense industry and provided some domestic job creation, but it did not
create an independent competitor to the U.S. defense industry. This is
exactly as expected with material and design levels of transfer. While
some of the very largest industrial states, such as India or China,
might eventually create a world-leading defense industry, it will remain
out of the grasp of most states. Consider China, an unquestionable
economic powerhouse of recent decades. [Despite decades of arms
purchases, technology transfer, blatant reverse engineering attempts,
and hundreds of billions of dollars, China still turns to Russia for
help with]{.underline} the most [advanced weaponry]{.underline} such as
fighter jets, helicopters, surface-to-air missiles, radars, and jet
engines. If China, the second largest economy in the world struggles so
mightily, what threat do smaller, less capable states pose? Capacity
transfer, the acquisition of basic scientific knowledge and expertise
crafted over decades, cannot simply be uploaded, emailed to another
state, or hacked. Rather, it takes decades of intentional and costly
investment. For high-end weaponry, where research and development costs
remain a prohibitive barrier to entry, the United States and a handful
of other advanced economies are likely to remain in the driver's seat;
even with generous technology transfer agreements. Finally,
[consider]{.underline} some of the negative second- and third-order
[effects that excessive restriction caused in American unwillingness to
commit to selling the U.S.-made Patriot missile system]{.underline} and
its underlying technology [to Turkey]{.underline}. This was recently
posited as a U.S. export restriction success. However, this restraint
looks less successful each passing day. Even with significant design
transfer, it is unlikely Turkey could obtain the requisite capacity
transfer to be self-sufficient in surface-to-air and anti-missile
defense systems anytime soon. Conversely, by using U.S. technology, the
United States could have legally restricted Turkey's future export of
it. More importantly, [Turkey has since agreed to purchase Russia's
advanced]{.underline} S-400 surface-to-air missile [system]{.underline},
a blow to U.S. and NATO relations with Turkey. The S-400 purchase will
put advanced Russian technology and military advisors inside a NATO ally
and tier-two F-35 industrial partner that is a sole-source supplier on
several F-35 components. As the Air Force Secretary said last year about
Turkey's S-400 agreement, "Sometimes it's the United States that's part
of the problem." [Even worse, the United States has since approved the
sale of the Patriot to Turkey]{.underline}, with the acting U.S. Defense
Secretary recently commenting, "we need Turkey to buy the Patriot." Was
holding back on some surface-to-air missile technology worth the
strategic cost? It appears unlikely.

[ONLY a few months ago, Canadians were earnestly debating whether or not
the country's]{.underline} Liberal [administration was right to go ahead
with executing a \$12bn contract to deliver armoured vehicles to Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}. The government said it would, but acknowledged its
critics' concerns by agreeing to adopt a version of an international
treaty that limits arms sales to rogues (see article). However, things
took a different turn. [It was the Saudis who plunged the deal into
uncertainty]{.underline}. After Canada's foreign minister urged the
release of some political prisoners on Twitter, the Saudi government
declared that all new business with Canada was suspended. This left
Canadians unsure if the kingdom still wants the arms deal. And if the
Saudis do walk away, plenty of other countries will be happy to supply
armoured cars. "They could get their combat vehicles from Turkey, South
Korea or Brazil," says Pieter Wezeman, a researcher at SIPRI, a
Stockholm-based think-tank. In the United States, meanwhile, [Congress
has been pressing the administration to implement the letter of a law
that would force countries to make a hard, instant choice between buying
American or Russian weapons. But]{.underline} the Pentagon is hinting
that [America's huge diplomatic power does not]{.underline} quite
[stretch that far]{.underline}. Defence officials argue it would be
better to accept that some countries will go on buying Russian weapons
for a while, in the hope they will gradually kick the habit. [Both these
developments reflect]{.underline} the volatile (and from a Western
viewpoint, **[barely controllable]{.underline}**) [state of the global
arms market. Total demand is growing, the number of sellers is rising
and]{.underline} the [Western countries that have dominated the business
are less confident of shaping the playing field]{.underline}. Above all,
[buyers are becoming more insistent on their right to shop
around]{.underline}. For the likes of India, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the
United Arab Emirates, "**[this is a buyer's market,]{.underline}**" says
Lucie Béraud-Sudreau of the International Institute for Strategic
Studies, a London-based think-tank. Speak softly and sell a big stick
The numbers show that the [global commerce in conventional weapons is
still dominated by the United States]{.underline}. [But America feels
strangely nervous about maintaining that role, and this year it has
adopted a more aggressive sales posture.]{.underline} Under a policy
proclaimed in April and mapped out in more detail last month, American
diplomats have been told to promote weapons sales more actively and
speed up procedures for approving them. [At first sight, American
apprehensions seem puzzling]{.underline}. There are several ways to
measure the arms market, but America comes out on top of all of them.
SIPRI has studied the volume of cross-border weapon transfers over the
five years to December and compared them with the previous five years
(see chart). The size of the world market rose by 10% between the two
periods. In the more recent one, America's slice of this expanding pie
was 34%, up from 30% in the previous five years. America and its five
nearest rivals (in descending order Russia, France, Germany, China and
Britain), account for nearly 80% of total transfers. Britain, meanwhile,
claims that last year it jumped to third place among global arms
exporters, as measured by the value of their sales. According to the
Defence and Security Organisation, a government body, America bagged 53%
of the global business, its "highest-ever market share". This left 16%
for Russia and 12% for Britain, double the share taken by France. In
part, [the jumpiness in Washington, DC, stems from the entry to the
market of new competitors]{.underline}, especially China. In part it
reflects new products and technologies where America will struggle to
keep its lead. Both these challenges were highlighted by the appearance
at last year's Paris Air Show of a Chinese military drone that looked
very like the American unmanned aircraft that have been used for
assassinations, for example in Pakistan. Hitherto, America has been
willing to share these powerful drones only with close European allies.
A new policy will broaden the range of customers and thus lessen the
risk that China will dominate a market that could soon be worth \$50bn a
year. China has long been better known as a buyer of arms, mainly from
Russia, than as a seller. A big share of its arms deliveries have gone
to close allies such as Pakistan. But it has enormously increased its
capacity to make and sell its own weapons, including ships and
submarines. Meanwhile, [American arms-export policy has been a
**delicate balance** between, on the one hand, seizing]{.underline}
economic and geopolitical [opportunity and, on the other, being
careful]{.underline} not to share technologies which could destabilise
war zones or be used against the United States. **[But]{.underline}**
such **[caution can be counter-productive]{.underline}**. At a panel
discussion in Washington this month, a defence-industry advocate
lamented that, because of America's technology-transfer curbs, France
had won from it a contract to sell airborne radar to India. "I like the
French, but I like American industry even more," he grumbled. In another
Franco-American contest over technology, France is finding it hard to
sell more Rafale combat aircraft to its prize arms customer, Egypt,
because the accompanying Scalp cruise missile incorporates American
know-how, the transfer of which to third parties is barred. France has
promised to develop its own technology, but Egypt may not have the
patience to wait. Egypt's government has also been a keen purchaser of
Russian equipment, including aircraft and attack helicopters. For
defence-equipment manufacturers such as Britain and France, export sales
matter ever more as a way to maintain their own industries. Britain's
edge in military aviation may depend on its sales to Saudi Arabia. And
the Royal Navy's ambitious building programme got a boost when Australia
said it would buy British for a new range of frigates. France wants to
develop a new air-to-air missile, but only, as Florence Parly, the
defence minister, put it, if it can get foreign customers. Such
[desperation adds to the frenzy of market competition]{.underline}. [So
does the utter indifference Russia and China display towards their
customers' human-rights policies]{.underline}. So too does the growth in
the number of countries that have graduated from being mainly buyers of
weapons and knowhow to sellers---Turkey, the Emirates and South Korea,
for example. Japan, which boasts a huge defence industry, is entirely
new to the market. It plunged in when the government lifted restrictions
on arms exports in 2014. It competes, albeit from a fairly weak
position, with China for Asia-Pacific customers. As for
[Russia]{.underline}, SIPRI calculates that its share of the global
market has slipped (to about 22% in 2013-17). But it [offers a blend of
tried-and-tested hardware and, to a few customers, superb know-how,
especially in air defence]{.underline}. [That creates a dilemma for
America]{.underline}, which hopes soon to sell weapons worth \$6bn to
India, but is dismayed by that country's determination to acquire S-400
air-defence systems from Russia: missiles that could ward off potential
threats from China or Pakistan. Other countries intent on continuing to
buy Russian include Indonesia and Vietnam. Jim Mattis, America's defence
secretary, has implored Congress not to be too harsh with Russia's
customers, so long as they pledge gradually to reduce their reliance. In
a letter leaked in July to Breaking Defense, a specialist news service,
he told a congressman: "[We are faced with a **once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity to decrease Russia's dominance in key
regions**]{.underline}." [But that **could only happen if America were
free to sell its own weapons**]{.underline}. For customers, that means
that for the foreseeable future they can keep both American and Russian
weapons in their arsenals.

#### Allowing arms sales to human rights violators allows the U.S. to compete with Russia

[Based on Trump's past statements, including support for known dictators

### L -- Saudi

#### The plan causes Saudi to seek arms from Russia \-\-- completely obviates any benefit of the plan

**Rounds 19** -- Ph.D. candidate at Georgetown University in
International Relations (Ray, "THE CASE AGAINST ARMS EMBARGOS, EVEN FOR
SAUDI ARABIA," *War on The Rocks*,
<https://warontherocks.com/2019/04/the-case-against-arms-embargos-even-for-saudi-arabia/)//BB>

One area in which U.S. President Donald Trump does not need to worry
about making America great again is international arms sales. [The
United States accounts for 34 percent of all global arms sales (second
place Russia remains]{.underline} a [distant]{.underline} 23 percent),
and has more than 40 defense companies in the top 100 globally. However,
with civilian deaths caused by the Saudi-led war in Yemen estimated at
between 16,000 and 50,000 by the end of 2018, calls for the United
States to suspend arms sales to its largest client --- Saudi Arabia ---
have understandably gained traction in both Congress and the public.
More generally, [several authors have penned articles]{.underline} in
these virtual pages [calling for more selective U.S. arms export
decisions or outright embargos]{.underline}, governed less by economic
motivations and more by concern about blowback, human rights,
dispersion, and reducing technology transfer. [I]{.underline}
respectfully [disagree]{.underline} with all of these recommendations.
Whether it is delayed approval, as in the recent Kuwaiti F-18 purchase,
an outright embargo, like Egyptian F-16s in 2013, or denial of
technology transfer, as in the 2016 Turkish Patriot missile request,
[using the withholding of arms sales as a blunt force
instrument]{.underline} of coercion [is unlikely to produce desired
strategic benefits and often backfires]{.underline}.

[Arms exports are **best** used for]{.underline} maintaining or
strengthening relationships while [limiting adversary access to client
states]{.underline}; a tool of nuanced influence, not outright coercion.
In fact, [threatening to withhold arms sales to coerce a state into
changing its behavior often has the opposite effect, leading clients to
**diversify their arms sourcing** instead of shifting
course]{.underline}. Similarly, calls to restrict technology transfer
and worries about demands for direct offsets mistake what is known as
"design technology transfer" for the much more difficult "capacity"
level of transfer. Both are explained in more detail below, but for now
it is worth noting that design transfer, the level at which most of
these offsets occur, does not lead to the creation of an independent
defense industry, but instead provides the United States with a source
of political power. The United States should not fear technology
transfer, but with the appropriate end-user controls, encourage it.
Additionally, while a large domestic market provides the United States
the luxury of sacrificing financial gains for political influence,
sometimes economics do matter; especially when it comes to preserving
complex production lines for future flexibility. Finally, the United
States should not look to use an arms embargo to coerce Saudi policy
change, not for economic reasons, but simply because it is unlikely to
work.

Greasing the Skids, Not Twisting Arms

[Arms sales are useful]{.underline} tools [for]{.underline} maintaining
communication, strengthening relationships, and [keeping potential
adversary states at bay]{.underline}. Conversely, as a blunt instrument
of coercion (i.e. if you do not do X, we will suspend Y), they are
likely losers. [Senior U.S. government officials involved in the arms
transfer process that I interviewed over the past year during the course
of my research have echoed similar sentiments]{.underline}. [This is
also borne out by previous research]{.underline} providing evidence that
using arms transfers as situationally coercive tools is rarely
successful. Interestingly, [coercion attempts using arms
transfers]{.underline} are least likely to be successful when used as a
punishment or threat against an autocratic regime, such as Saudi Arabia.
Instead, punishments in the form of an embargo can often [push a client
to **diversify sourcing** rather than to change behavior]{.underline}.

[Consider Indonesia and Egypt]{.underline}. [In 2015, Egypt agreed to
purchase]{.underline} nearly 50 [Russian]{.underline}
MiG-29M/[M2s]{.underline} and more than two-dozen French Rafales. This
represented a shocking turn of events after more than three decades of
purchasing only American-made fighter jets[. It was also driven largely
by the U.S. embargo]{.underline} put in place in 2013, after the
Egyptian army's removal of then-President Mohamed Morsi, who had won the
presidency in a 2012 election. The embargo caused significant tension
between the two states driven by "an Egyptian sense that they were at a
point of mortal peril" while the United States was moralizing about
democratic reforms. Remarkably, [the United States lifted the embargo in
2015 with virtually no change in Egyptian policies]{.underline}, no
official U.S. "democracy certification", and Egyptian military support
for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. The U.S. arms embargo as a tool of
coercive change was an abject failure.

[A similar story played out in Indonesia more than a decade prior. A
long-time arms client of the United States with no history of Russian
imports, Indonesia announced a deal with Russia in 2003 to purchase
Russian Su-27/30s]{.underline}. While Indonesia was always far more
politically neutral than Egypt, this remarkable turnaround in arms
sourcing diversification appears to be the result of a U.S. arms embargo
implemented in 1999 in response to Indonesia's apparent human rights
violations carrying out heavy-handed military actions in East Timor.
Furious at U.S. meddling in something the government considered a
domestic issue, Indonesia looked instead to Russia with the specific
intent to "overcome the effects of \[U.S.\] arms sales restrictions." In
other words, Indonesia looked to diversify, not capitulate. [Indonesia
continued sourcing Russian arms even after the United States lifted the
embargo]{.underline} in 2005. Perhaps most remarkably, even after the
United States agreed to give Indonesia 24 F-16s in 2012, the archipelago
state still agreed to purchase 11 Russian Su-35s. The U.S. attempt at
coercion not only failed but continues to perpetuate negative strategic
effects today.

Who's Afraid of Technology Transfer?

Another argument for a more restrictive arms export policy concerns
direct industrial offsets (those economic agreements in which a supplier
invests in the industry of a client state directly related to the arms
being transferred) and technology transfer. However, these tools should
not be feared. Technology transfer is unlikely to breed meaningful
competition for the United States where it matters most, in the medium-
to high-end markets, and instead gives the United States a source of
political influence. The problem in many analyses is confusion over the
type of technology transfer. There are three ideal-typical categories of
transfer: material transfer, such as simple diffusion of weapons and
machines; design transfer, like blueprints and schematics; and capacity
transfer, which involves basic scientific knowledge and expertise within
the industrial base. Most technology transfers ultimately fall into the
first two categories, despite what a client state might hope for.
Consider the 2003 Polish decision to purchase F-16s from Lockheed Martin
with direct offsets valued at more than \$6 billion. This represented
170 percent of the program value and the then-largest in commercial
history. Despite this massive investment, Poland does not design and
produce their own fighter jets today, but rather subsections of
American-designed systems under license. In fact, direct offsets
provided inroads for U.S. industry in the Polish defense industry in a
manner that strongly incentivizes the Poles to continue purchasing U.S.
aircraft, and indeed Poland appears poised to purchase the F-35 in the
near future. Offsets and technology transfer may have helped revive
portions of the Polish defense industry and provided some domestic job
creation, but it did not create an independent competitor to the U.S.
defense industry. This is exactly as expected with material and design
levels of transfer. While some of the very largest industrial states,
such as India or China, might eventually create a world-leading defense
industry, it will remain out of the grasp of most states. Consider
China, an unquestionable economic powerhouse of recent decades. [Despite
decades of arms purchases, technology transfer, blatant reverse
engineering attempts, and hundreds of billions of dollars, China still
turns to Russia for help with]{.underline} the most [advanced
weaponry]{.underline} such as fighter jets, helicopters, surface-to-air
missiles, radars, and jet engines. If China, the second largest economy
in the world struggles so mightily, what threat do smaller, less capable
states pose? Capacity transfer, the acquisition of basic scientific
knowledge and expertise crafted over decades, cannot simply be uploaded,
emailed to another state, or hacked. Rather, it takes decades of
intentional and costly investment. For high-end weaponry, where research
and development costs remain a prohibitive barrier to entry, the United
States and a handful of other advanced economies are likely to remain in
the driver's seat; even with generous technology transfer agreements.
Finally, [consider]{.underline} some of the negative second- and
third-order [effects that excessive restriction caused in American
unwillingness to commit to selling the U.S.-made Patriot missile
system]{.underline} and its underlying technology [to
Turkey]{.underline}. This was recently posited as a U.S. export
restriction success. However, this restraint looks less successful each
passing day. Even with significant design transfer, it is unlikely
Turkey could obtain the requisite capacity transfer to be
self-sufficient in surface-to-air and anti-missile defense systems
anytime soon. Conversely, by using U.S. technology, the United States
could have legally restricted Turkey's future export of it. More
importantly, [Turkey has since agreed to purchase Russia's
advanced]{.underline} S-400 surface-to-air missile [system]{.underline},
a blow to U.S. and NATO relations with Turkey. The S-400 purchase will
put advanced Russian technology and military advisors inside a NATO ally
and tier-two F-35 industrial partner that is a sole-source supplier on
several F-35 components. As the Air Force Secretary said last year about
Turkey's S-400 agreement, "Sometimes it's the United States that's part
of the problem." [Even worse, the United States has since approved the
sale of the Patriot to Turkey]{.underline}, with the acting U.S. Defense
Secretary recently commenting, "we need Turkey to buy the Patriot." Was
holding back on some surface-to-air missile technology worth the
strategic cost? It appears unlikely.

Sometimes It's Not Dollars, But Sense

As others have pointed out, the United States can afford to "make
economic \[...\] sacrifices" in order to privilege politico-security
benefits in arms export decisions. As one author recently explained in
War on the Rocks: The United States is so economically advantaged in
making and selling weapons that it can limit conventional-weapons
proliferation \[and\] ... technology diffusion, (and maintain a robust
defense industrial base) while retaining its commanding market position.
This is undoubtedly true. However, on rare occasions economics do
matter. Specifically, maintaining strategic flexibility by keeping a
production line open which would otherwise shutter might sometimes need
to be prioritized. Consider the two recent examples of the F-22 and
F-15. In December 2011, the final F-22 fighter jet rolled off the
assembly line, 554 short of the original program requirement. At the
same time, close U.S. allies such as Japan and Australia made inquiries
about purchasing further increments of the fifth-generation fighter,
which would have kept production going for at least several more years.
The United States rejected the inquiries, shuttering the production line
instead. A 2011 RAND Corporation study estimates the cost of restarting
production and fabricating 75 additional F-22s to be \$17 billion ---
nearly \$227 million per jet. Despite this cost and because of an
evolving international security environment, the US Congress inserted
language into the 2017 defense budget directing the U.S. Air Force to
conduct a "production restart assessment," though the likelihood of a
production restart remains infinitesimally small. Fortunately, the
outcome is different for the F-15. In 2013, Qatar made a request for the
purchase of 70 F-15QAs, worth \$4 billion. At the time, without another
export order the 40-year old F-15 production line was slated to close by
2019, eliminating any future purchases. After delaying approval for
nearly three years, the U.S. administration finally approved the deal in
late 2016, guaranteeing F-15 production into the mid-2020s. Unlike the
F-22, the United States maintains strategic flexibility in F-15 (and
F-18 and F-16) production, largely because of exports. This appears to
be an especially prescient decision, as the FY2020 U.S. Air Force budget
proposal requests money to purchase at least eight (and up to 100)
F-15EX air superiority platforms; a platform one industry reporter
highlighted "is only possible because other countries have spent roughly
\$5B over the last couple of decades to continuously evolve the F-15
into what it is today \[...\] basically, the \[Air Force\] is getting
\[these upgrades\] for free."

What About Saudi Arabia?

In sum, more restrictive arms sales, delivery suspensions, or outright
embargos are unlikely to succeed in policy coercion. [While arms
transfers provide an avenue of influence, embargos often lead to
**diversification**, not desired policy changes]{.underline}.
Additionally, fears of technology transfer and direct offsets creating a
competitor out of every client are generally unfounded in the high-end
market in which the United States generally deals. Finally, while the
large domestic market provides the United States the luxury of
sacrificing financial gains for political influence, sometimes economics
do matter, particularly when it comes to saving a production line for
future flexibility. [These conclusions should therefore inform U.S.
policy on Saudi Arabia]{.underline}. The intent here is not to argue the
moral or ethical responsibility of U.S. leaders in responding to Saudi
Arabia's execution of journalists or tactics in the war in Yemen. It is
natural to see the horror wrought in Yemen and want to take any actions
necessary to stop it. However, I ultimately argue against a Saudi
embargo. This is not because, as the president has argued, it might cost
a few billion dollars and some hundreds of defense industry jobs. As
others have pointed out, the economic impact of Saudi arms purchases on
the U.S. defense industry is relatively small. Rather, [embargoing Saudi
Arabia is unlikely to fundamentally alter Saudi policies, but likely to
further damage U.S. ties with Riyadh]{.underline}. In the near-term,
[Saudi Arabia can substitute other weapons]{.underline}, such as the
Eurofighter and Tornado, and "dumb bombs" instead of U.S.-built "smart
weapons." [The Saudis can]{.underline} also [rely more heavily
on]{.underline} their Emirati and Egyptian partners using [non-U.S.
produced arms]{.underline}. In the medium to long term, [such an embargo
is likely to push the Kingdom to greater arms diversification. If
history is any guide, the United States will eventually lift any
potential arms embargo with little change in Saudi behavior, but **only
after having provided an opportunity for adversary states** such as
Russia]{.underline} and China [to **gain a strategic foothold** in
Riyadh]{.underline}. [Some might counter that it would be extremely
difficult and costly, in both time and money, for the Saudis to
significantly diversify their arms acquisitions away from the United
States. This is absolutely the case]{.underline}. **[However, costly
does not mean impossible]{.underline}**. [Less wealthy states have
already done it. Egypt is one example above; but others such as
Venezuela and even tiny Kuwait --- frustrated at years of U.S. approval
delays --- have significantly diversified their arms
acquisitions]{.underline}. In other words, [with the money and options
available to Saudi Arabia, and few other producers showing a stomach for
a full embargo, it is not unreasonable to believe that the Saudis might
**significantly diversify** their arms acquisitions]{.underline} over
time [in response to a U.S. embargo. Thus, while a U.S. embargo might
be]{.underline} morally compelling and [emotionally satisfying, it is
unlikely to create meaningful change for those most at risk or be
strategically beneficial to the United States]{.underline}. In the
absence of a compelling, evidence-based case that an arms embargo on
Saudi Arabia might produce desired changes in behavior, policymakers
should look elsewhere for solutions to their Saudi problems.

#### Russia fills in to sell Saudi Arabia significant armaments

Whatever the reason, the green-light policy has proved to be a failure.
The United States has not ended up with a close partner in the Middle
East but with a rogue ally drawing America into unnecessary quagmires
and hurting its interests. The question is what to do about it.

[It might feel good for the United States to turn its back on the
Saudis, but that won't enhance U.S. interests or save
lives]{.underline}. The United States has leverage it must use, but that
has to be carefully estimated.

[A divorce will not cause the Saudis to walk away from the war in Yemen
or make up with the Qataris. If anything, the end result will be the
Saudis will be less restrained, because they will no longer feel the
need to acquiesce to U.S. requests]{.underline}. [They will certainly
feel the loss of sophisticated American weaponry, but the **Russians
will step in**]{.underline} [and supply them with **less accurate
weapons** that will likely **just kill more** in Yemen]{.underline} (for
evidence of that, consider Syria). [The United States will no longer be
complicit in problematic Saudi behavior, but that behavior won't
stop]{.underline}.

### L -- Middle East

#### Russia fills in \-\-- uses the plan to sustain their foreign policy ambitions

\-\--empirics + their weapons are good enough

Russia's Arms Sales to the Middle East," *Jamestown Foundation*,
<https://jamestown.org/program/tactical-side-russias-arms-sales-middle-east/)//BB>

Nonetheless, [there is no denying that Putin is making great strides
overall in the MENA region]{.underline} since May 2000,
[and]{.underline} more recently [in the defense sector as part of
Russia's tactic to use weapons sales to garner closer relations with
Arab states at the expense of the U.S.]{.underline} and Europe. Moscow's
military reform efforts since 2008 have clearly paid off, and [arms
sales have been a]{.underline}n effective [tactical tool in Moscow's
foreign policy arsenal]{.underline}. In dollar terms at least, Russian
arms sales to the Middle East continue to increase every year. In
addition, the advantages Russian arms offer to this region continue to
outweigh the disadvantages, both practically and politically. [Russia's
overall economic trajectory is on a slow and long-term path of
deterioration]{.underline}, but still nowhere near a collapse. As a July
2016 NATO Defense College report points out, [the West should not
confuse Russia's weakness with fragility]{.underline}.\[lxxviii\] Even
if Moscow boasts more than it achieves in reality, the Kremlin has been
playing a diminishing hand very well. [While most U.S. defense experts
believe Russia will be unable to produce much next-generation weaponry,
Moscow is making **significant strides** with its existing technology.
Russian arms are sufficient for most of Moscow's
clients]{.underline}---particularly those who cannot afford
top-of-the-line American technology. **[In the context of U.S.
retreat]{.underline}** from the region, **[Moscow has stepped into a
vacuum]{.underline}** [where the Kremlin's efforts generate a
**multiplier effect** of real power]{.underline}. [As long as U.S.
leadership is absent]{.underline} from the region, [Russia's arms sales
to the Middle East and North Africa will remain a **serious problem**
for American interests]{.underline}.

Overall, [Putin's current policy]{.underline} in the Middle East is
succeeding. While some scholars brand him a mere tactician and not a
strategist, he is actually both.657 Not only has he seized initiative in
the Middle East, but he also [has a clear end state in mind---a
polycentric world where Russia has renewed geopolitical strength to
balance the United States]{.underline}. Furthermore, many of
[Russia's]{.underline} tactical [victories]{.underline} in improving
relations with Middle Eastern countries have [come at the expense of
Western influence, specifically America's]{.underline}. [While some of
these victories, like the Western embargo of Egypt, were not part of a
master plan on Putin's part, his actions display a **deft
"opportunistic" touch**]{.underline}.658 It was Putin who flew into
Syria in December 2017, declaring "Mission Accomplished" in regard to
the war versus the Islamic State.659 As Matthew Spence, the former
Deputy Secretary of Defense for Middle Eastern Policy remarked,
"**[power abhors a vacuum]{.underline}**."660 [Putin]{.underline} fully
understands the logic behind Spence's statement. He
[observed]{.underline} the [Obama]{.underline} Administration [beating a
slow retreat]{.underline} from playing the region's "policeman."661 He
then saw the Trump Administration's recent rash of incoherent policy,
such as recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, effectively
destroying America's ability to mediate Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations.662 As such, [he has been able to exploit the void of
American leadership]{.underline} and insert Russia back into a position
of influence in order to, as Vladimir Frolov states, "cut the \[the
United States\] down to size."663 [Putin will continue to capitalize on
Western weaknesses]{.underline} during his ongoing campaign [to foster a
polycentric world and restore Russia's reputation to that of a great
power]{.underline}. [Given the local demand that exists]{.underline} in
the region, [arms sales will remain one of Putin's key tools to sustain
and increase Russian influence in the Middle East]{.underline}. As
mentioned earlier, [the long-term success of Putin's plan will require
additional diplomatic maneuvering]{.underline}, but his current efforts
are laying the foundation for positive future outcomes.

#### Russian influence in the Middle East is [tenuous]{.underline} \-\-- future arms sales are key

After almost two decades of relative political obscurity,
[Russia]{.underline} is back, and [has]{.underline} once more [set its
sights on a global role beyond the classic trade of goods and services
with geopolitcally strategic economies]{.underline}. Then again,
non-economic elements are almost always present when it comes to such a
specific commodity as weaponry. Opinion on this greatly vary.
Subscribers of new cold war rhetoric see Russia as a great threat trying
to dismantle the international security order established by the United
States. We often heard such remarks from Hillary Clinton and her
followers, as well as think-tanks and the media friendly to her. \"I
think [Russia\'s objectives are to stymie and to confront and to
undermine American power whenever and wherever they can,\" Clinton
told]{.underline} the [Brookings]{.underline} Institution in September
2015. [But how far Russia\'s resurgence in the Middle East will
ultimately go remains to be seen]{.underline}. [In any case, Russia\'s
arms sales will play an **important role** in the country\'s
geopolitical plans]{.underline}.

[Beyond mining]{.underline} and other resources, [Russia is]{.underline}
still eyeing [energy sectors in sub-Saharan Africa]{.underline}, as it
promotes nuclear power as a driver of economic development. Its most
prominent move came in 2014, with a landmark but controversial \$76
billion deal for Russian energy giant Rosatom to build two nuclear power
plants in South Africa, which has the continent's only nuclear power
station. Then-President Jacob Zuma personally championed the deal,
bypassing South Africa's parliament. When the deal collapsed in 2017
after a South African court ruled it unlawful, Russia was forced to look
elsewhere in Africa for nuclear energy clients. That search has achieved
some notable success. Last October, Rosatom signed a \$20 billion deal
to construct two nuclear power plants in Nigeria, Africa's largest
economy. Russia is now set to play a leading role in eliminating
Nigeria's chronic electricity shortages, winning it praise. The Nigeria
deal also encouraged Lavrov to negotiate with Angola on the construction
of nuclear power plants, and to forge a nuclear technology-sharing
agreement with Namibia, the world's fourth largest producer of uranium.
[The growing appeal of Russian weaponry has pushed several African
leaders to ask Moscow for help in carrying out counterterrorism
operations]{.underline}. When it comes to security, Russia has focused
chiefly on expanding its array of existing arms contracts and
positioning itself as a useful counterterrorism partner. [Russia has
emphasized its willingness to sell arms to governments **without
discrimination**]{.underline} [on ideological or human rights grounds,
portraying itself as a reliable arms vendor to authoritarian African
leaders]{.underline}. Many of those leaders see proof of Russia's
commitment to noninterference in Moscow's strident defense of former
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe against potential U.N. sanctions in
2008, along with Russian arms sales to Sudan after its president, Omar
al-Bashir, was indicted by the International Criminal Court in 2009.
[This hands-off policy has helped Russia expand beyond its traditional
Soviet-era coterie in sub-Saharan Africa]{.underline}. Since 2010,
Russia has supplied Uganda with 74 percent of its conventional weaponry,
signed a \$1 billion defense cooperation agreement with Angola, and
agreed to a major military-technical cooperation pact with Nigeria.
These deals are likely to continue to expand in the years to come, as
Russia's effective use of air power during its military intervention in
Syria and successful marketing of its S-400 missile defense
system---which it recently sold to Turkey, a NATO member---increase its
influence over international arms markets. The growing appeal of Russian
weaponry to several African countries has also pushed their leaders to
solicit Moscow for help in carrying out counterterrorism operations.
Russia has been especially interested in assisting Nigeria combat the
extremist group Boko Haram, while outlining a strategy to deepen its
overall cooperation with Abuja. Even though the Nigerian military
continues to work closely with the United States against Boko Haram,
Russia's offers have been received positively in Nigeria. Nigerian
Defense Minister Mansur Dan Ali pointed to Russia's potential role as a
counterterrorism partner during his meeting with his Russian
counterpart, Sergey Shoygu, last summer in Moscow. Dan Ali even cited
Moscow's record against the self-proclaimed Islamic State in
Syria---where Russia rarely distinguished between "terrorists" and
opposition forces---as a model for West Africa to follow. As senior
officials in other African countries, like Chad and Somalia, echo the
Nigerian defense minister's praise for Russia, [Moscow could gain a more
prominent role in providing logistical assistance to governments across
the continent facing their own domestic insurgencies]{.underline}. It
isn't surprising that, during his Africa trip, Lavrov capitalized on
Russia's growing reputation by offering military assistance to
Mozambique, which has experienced a wave of attacks by Islamist groups
in the gas-rich northern part of the country. [Even though Russia's
influence in sub-Saharan Africa still **pales** in comparison
to]{.underline} China's---and, for that matter, [the]{.underline}
[United States']{.underline}---[Moscow has paid more attention
to]{.underline} the region in recent years, for its own economic
interests and great power aspirations, and to satisfy [African
countries' desire for sophisticated weaponry. As Russia continues to
expand its network]{.underline} of partnerships and support
counterterrorism initiatives across the continent, [its rising influence
in sub-Saharan Africa could take a U.S. administration that has shown
little interest in Africa by surprise]{.underline}.

While Russian arms are competitive across sub-Saharan Africa, most of
the region's countries are comparatively poor. Defence spending in
absolute terms is therefore too modest for Africa to become a
destination of real commercial significance. This will not change unless
economic growth accelerates at a sustained rate across the region.
Nevertheless, [Russian exporters appear keen to strengthen their
position, with officials from Rosoboroneksport describing Africa as a
'growth market']{.underline}.70 [Russian suppliers appear to be prepared
to tailor their approach to the African market by focusing on the
provision of either older equipment or of service and repair
facilities]{.underline}.71 Regardless of whether the region grows in
commercial importance, [Russia's importance as a supplier of armaments
there means that it could **exploit any political capital**]{.underline}

Though [its foreign actions are]{.underline} often [opportunistic,
Russia increasingly aims to create a multipolar world in which it plays
a more prominent role]{.underline}. Moscow's national security
establishment broadly supports this international outreach, which will
likely remain an enduring feature of Russian foreign policy. Washington
and its allies must carefully judge Russian actions case by case and
respond in concert when possible. THE KREMLIN'S INTERNATIONAL AGENDA
[Moscow has relied on relatively inexpensive]{.underline} diplomatic,
military, intelligence, cyber, trade, energy, and financial [tools to
wield influence and expand its global footprint]{.underline}. **[The
Kremlin has capitalized on Western missteps]{.underline}** and growing
anti-establishment sentiments in Europe and North America. [Russia will
likely continue trying to fill]{.underline} global [power vacuums
resulting from]{.underline} U.S. President Donald [Trump's]{.underline}
"America First" foreign [policy]{.underline}. IMPLICATIONS FOR U.S.
FOREIGN POLICY Formulating an effective response to Russia's global
activism will be challenging. To do so, U.S. policymakers should
consider four broad points: Ask the first-order question. How do
Russia's actions affect U.S. interests and foreign policy goals? In some
areas, Russian activities have damaged U.S. interests, but elsewhere
their impact has been symbolic rather than substantive. Russian activity
should not be conflated with Russian success. Weigh costs and benefits.
Russia's approach has had mixed results. Its investments in the Middle
East have paid off handsomely. But in Europe, Russian actions have
mobilized Western governments to counter them. Notably, Moscow has fewer
resources than the West, serious domestic problems, and no real allies.
Avoid overreacting. Not every instance of Russian activism threatens the
U.S.-led international order or U.S. security. At a minimum, Washington
and its allies should expose Moscow's tactics. More robust responses are
justified when important U.S. and allied interests are threatened---and
when Washington has realistic, sustainable means to thwart Moscow's
ambitions without exacerbating the situation. Leverage partnerships and
eschew a one-size-fits-all approach. There is no cookie-cutter solution
for countering Russian adventurism. Washington need not bear this burden
alone; it should develop tailored strategies with other actors to deter,
contain, and, if necessary, roll back Russian influence operations.
INTRODUCTION For much of the post--Cold War era, the United States and
Europe paid little attention to Russia's efforts to expand its
political, economic, and military influence abroad. The West saw these
efforts as relics of the Cold War, primarily confined to Russia's
immediate neighborhood but largely absent or at least ineffective
elsewhere. The effects of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia's
internal challenges, and Moscow's stated desire for integration with the
West sharply constrained the Kremlin's interest and capacity to project
its influence on a global scale and diminished the West's interest in
Russian foreign policy and its global activities. However, since
Vladimir Putin returned to the Russian presidency in 2012 after a
four-year stint as prime minister, Russia has engaged in a broad,
sophisticated, well-resourced, and---to many observers---surprisingly
effective campaign to expand its global reach. To advance its diverse
objectives, Moscow has relied on a wide array of diplomatic, military,
intelligence, cyber, trade, energy, and financial tools to influence
political systems, public attitudes, and elite decisionmakers in Europe,
the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. These objectives
include, first and foremost, undermining the U.S.-led liberal
international order and the cohesion of the West; enhancing Putin's
domestic legitimacy by demonstrating Russia's status as a global
superpower; promoting specific Russian commercial, military, and energy
interests; and tweaking the United States' nose in areas of traditional
U.S. influence. Russia has engaged in a broad, sophisticated,
well-resourced, and---to many observers---surprisingly effective
campaign to expand its global reach. The Kremlin launched this campaign
in response to the 2012 mass protests in Moscow, apparently convinced
that Western democracy promotion initiatives had instigated these
demonstrations to destabilize Russia itself and promote regime change.1
In 2014, following Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and the start
of its undeclared war in Ukraine, this counteroffensive intensified and
took on new qualities. Whereas previously the bulk of Russian efforts
had focused on defending Moscow's claimed "sphere of privileged
interests" around its periphery, the new campaign has sought to damage
the international image of Western democracy, exacerbate the internal
tensions within Western political and security institutions, and expand
Russia's global reach at the expense of Washington and its allies by
playing on Western missteps in different parts of the world. [For the
first time since the breakup of the Soviet Union, the United States is
facing a]{.underline} [Russia]{.underline} that is not, in former
president Barack Obama's memorable phrase, a mere "regional power," but
rather one [that is actively trying to project its influence and
establish a presence well beyond its periphery]{.underline}.2 Despite
Moscow's shift in strategy, the United States and its European partners
are increasingly focused on their own domestic challenges and regional
crises in Asia and the Middle East. [Russia is keen to exploit increased
opportunities in the]{.underline} resulting [vacuum]{.underline}, using
both hard and soft power, [to expand its influence and presence and to
take advantage of]{.underline} Donald Trump's presidency, marked by his
embrace of an "America First" foreign policy and:3 [a retreat
from]{.underline} long-established [U.S. leadership]{.underline} in
upholding the rules-based international order Washington helped create
after World War II; an abandonment of democracy promotion and rule of
law as elements of U.S. foreign policy; a return to isolationism and a
rejection of nation-building efforts to redirect U.S. resources needed
at home; a dismissal of multilateral cooperation and a devaluation of
long-standing U.S. alliances; the worst domestic political crisis in the
United States in many decades; and, most importantly, a refusal to
acknowledge the challenge posed by Russian adventurism. Finding examples
of Russian global activism is easy. Assessing its motivations,
consequences, and effectiveness is not. Specifically, it can be hard to
tell whether a given Russian behavior is meant to actively undermine the
liberal political and economic order that has flourished under U.S.
leadership or whether it is designed primarily to shore up Putin's
domestic standing and to create timely economic opportunities for
domestic Russian constituencies that support his regime. Likewise,
framing a coherent and effective U.S. response to Russia's increased
global activism will be challenging. The risk of doing too much or too
little is real, and getting the answer right entails asking a series of
challenging questions. Is Moscow's behavior largely symbolic or does it
threaten the interests of the United States or its closest allies? What
is the cost to U.S. interests of Russia's efforts to gain geopolitical
and economic toeholds beyond its immediate neighborhood? When should
Russian actions trigger a strong U.S. response? Which Russian activities
may risk overreach and pushback? What are the best ways to measure the
impact---both in Russia and the West---of Moscow's recent global
activism? Finding examples of Russian global activism is easy. Assessing
its motivations, consequences, and effectiveness is not. Identifying the
key drivers of Russia's global activism and providing an overview of
Moscow's many efforts to expand its global influence is a useful and
important way to begin formulating appropriate and effective responses
to these behaviors. In some areas, Russian activities have damaged
Western interests, but in others their impact has proven to be more
symbolic than substantive. Not every far-flung Russian initiative should
be viewed as part of a global zero-sum competition between the United
States and Russia, and the costs to Russia of some of these efforts
could exceed the benefits Moscow hopes to gain. Policymakers should seek
to assess the interests that a given Russian behavior is seeking to
advance, which policy tools Moscow is employing, which U.S. interests
are being undermined, and which U.S. policy tools would constitute the
most effective response. THE WEST AND THE REST Russia's global activism
can be divided into four geographic regions. While there may be some
uncertainty about the drivers at play in each of these regions, there is
little uncertainty about the considerable momentum behind these efforts.
In general, Moscow's ordering of priorities aligns closely with the
proximity of the region to Russia, as well as with Russian threat
perceptions. First are Moscow's efforts to retain its influence or
counter Western influence in the states of the former Soviet Union. In
its immediate periphery, Moscow aims to firm up its hold on its
neighbors to prevent additional countries from aligning too closely with
the West, and to preserve a buffer zone of pro-Russian or, at least,
neutral states around it. In countries that have already turned away
from Russia---Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine---Moscow seeks to undermine
their political transitions, court their publics, and prevent their true
integration with Western political, economic, or security structures.
Moscow also is keen to shore up its influence in Central Asia, a region
increasingly dominated economically by China. The second category
consists of Moscow's efforts to undermine the Western and transatlantic
institutions it considers its principal adversaries---the United States,
the European Union (EU), and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO). Moscow has attempted to exploit their internal divisions and
challenges as well as the uncertainty about Washington's commitment to
its allies and partners since President Donald Trump's embrace of the
"America First" agenda. Moscow's anti-Western actions are motivated by a
widely held view in the Russian security establishment that the
administrations of former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush
actively sought to weaken Russia domestically, undermine its influence
internationally, increase its isolation, and carry out regime change
around Russia's periphery and even in the country itself. Russian
leaders apparently have decided to do to the West what they believe the
West has done to them. Third, Russia is engaging in a campaign to gain
or regain influence in other places where the Soviet Union once held
sway. In the Balkans, for example, Russia plays the nationalist and
Christian Orthodox cards to complicate Western efforts to integrate
these countries into European structures. In the Middle East, Russia
seeks to protect its longstanding equities in Syria and to convey its
purported great power status to domestic and international audiences, as
well as its capacity to act beyond its immediate neighborhood and gain a
foothold in what is seen as a traditionally U.S. sphere of influence.
The final category consists of Russian efforts to gain influence in
parts of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Some of these efforts involve
forming coalitions of rising powers willing to challenge the
Western-dominated international system; elsewhere, [Moscow tries
to]{.underline} cultivate authoritarian leaders and [take advantage of
frictions between the United States and]{.underline} some of [its
traditional allies or partners. In Latin America, in particular, Moscow
hopes to embarrass Washington and show that it too can make a foray into
its main global adversary's backyard]{.underline}.

#### Russia [pounces]{.underline} on US weakness in Latin America

**Tidd 17** -- Admiral, COMMANDER, UNITED STATES SOUTHERN COMMAND (Kurt,
BEFORE THE 115TH CONGRESS SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE 6 APRIL 2017,
Lexis)//BB

Mr. Chairman, I'll speak plainly: if we care about what's going on in
the South China Sea, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East, it's worth
keeping an eye on Chinese, Russian, and Iranian activity in this part of
the world, too. [For Russia]{.underline}, China, and Iran, [Latin
America is not an afterthought]{.underline}. These global actors view
the Latin American economic, political, and security arena as an
opportunity to achieve their respective long-term objectives and advance
interests that may be incompatible with ours and those of our partners.
[Their vision for an alternative international order poses a challenge
to every nation that values non-aggression, rule of law, and respect for
human rights]{.underline}---the very same principles that underlie the
Inter-American system of peace and cooperation. Some of what they're
doing---while not a direct military threat---does warrant examination.
Even seemingly benign activities can be used to build malign influence.
Now the region's number two trading partner, China has courted Latin
America through economic diplomacy, importing more and more raw
materials, offering loans, and pledging billions in investments in
infrastructure development. It sees its own development as contingent on
the development of other countries, including those in Latin America and
the Caribbean.2 Beijing cooperates with Latin America on space,
potential nuclear power projects, and telecommunications networks, which
could pose security concerns to the United States. China's military soft
power lies in its ability to engage through offers of all-expenses-paid
training, nostrings-attached defense sales and financing to regional
militaries, and donations of equipment and humanitarian aid. China
prioritizes engagement with regional organizations like the Community of
Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) that exclude the United
States, and seeks to leverage regional relationships to reshape
international economic and financial institutions to its advantage.3 [As
part of the Kremlin's aim to regain its status as a global
power]{.underline} and prove its prowess to domestic audiences, [Russia
uses soft power tools in an attempt to challenge U.S. leadership in the
Western Hemisphere and displace traditional U.S. goodwill
initiatives]{.underline}. Examples include the construction of an
international police training facility in Nicaragua that will be used to
provide regional counternarcotics training and the funding of a vaccine
production plant that will supposedly make drugs accessible and
affordable throughout Central America. Additionally, Russia seeks to
discredit the United States through state-owned media like RT-Español
and SputnikMundo, which spread misinformation to create doubts and
distrust about U.S. intentions and policy towards the region and other
parts of the world. [The Russians]{.underline} are also engaging in some
disquieting behavior, such as [providing battle tanks to Nicaragua,
which impacts regional stability and could cause its neighbors to divert
vital resources (needed to fight threat networks and address
developmental challenges) to maintain parity]{.underline}. As a
continuing state sponsor of terrorism, Iranian involvement in the
Western Hemisphere is always a matter of concern. With the easing of
economic sanctions, Iran may be seeking to rebuild its relationships in
the region. Tehran uses cooperative technological, economic, and
diplomatic interests as the centerpiece of its regional diplomacy.
Although on the surface it portrays its actions as innocuous, Iran could
exploit its cultural centers to build networks, which could be leveraged
to extend its influence and advance its interests. Broadly speaking,
some of this outreach is concerning, especially to those of us who care
about advancing human rights and promoting regional peace and stability.
Keep in mind there's no Chinese, Russian, or Iranian equivalent of a
Leahy Law, no comparable conditions on security assistance, no
independent domestic media that carefully scrutinizes their activities.
Their arms sales aren't tied to international protocols or human rights
vetting. Their loans don't come with requirements to follow strict
environmental or anti-corruption standards, or even clear terms and
conditions for repayment. Their unscrupulous business practices and
disregard for rule of law facilitates corruption, reduces trust in
governments, and poses challenges to the norms and values that have
brought prosperity and security for millions of people across our
hemisphere. It's also worth noting that in recent years these actors
have capitalized on the perception that [the U.S.]{.underline} is
disengaging from the region. Our partners plainly see that we are
conducting fewer engagements; holding smaller and less frequent
exercises; and that we have smaller U.S. military presence in regional
embassies and fewer forces and platforms than ever before. When budget
constraints limit our ability to engage with our regional partners, it
sends a message that others can, and do, exploit. And while we should
work harder to understand the true intentions of these actors, whatever
they intend, in most cases our best response is to strengthen our own
security relationships, rather than focus on "countering" or "competing"
with the likes of China or Russia. At times---when it supports our
interests and those of our partners---we should follow avenues for
cooperation. At others, we might find we need to work with our partners
to address negative influence or destabilizing actions. At all times,
[we should focus on **being the best possible partner** to the
region]{.underline}. So it's on us to demonstrate our commitment by
being an equal and principled partner; it's on us to earn, and keep, the
region's trust. It's on us, because we lose relationships not as a
result of any Chinese or Russian actions; we lose them, in large part,
by not demonstrating the depth of our commitment to the region. Our
leadership is weakened not because China or Russia offer compelling
alternatives, but because it's not always clear to our network of allies
and partners what's important to us. [American (and Inter-American)
principles are undermined not because they no longer matter, but because
we]{.underline} and our partners [don't do everything we can to protect
and promote them.]{.underline} Mr. Chairman, it comes down to this: we
have a choice. [Success or failure in this region depends
on]{.underline} us, what we stand for, and [what we do]{.underline},
much more than it depends on anyone else.

Russian President Vladimir [Putin has made no effort to hide his desire
to reestablish his country as a viable power player and competitor to
U.S. influence in the region]{.underline}. Viewed through the lens of
the Gerasimov Doctrine, [this engagement is both rational from the
Russian perspective and dangerous to the United States]{.underline}. So
far, Russia has primarily focused its outreach efforts on allies in the
Bolivarian Alliance, led by Venezuela and including Cuba, Nicaragua,
Bolivia, El Salvador, and Suriname, all of whom share a strong anti-U.S.
ideology with each possessing deeply criminalized governments.1 Often
operating as a sort of "parasite state," the public outreach of the
Putin regime in Latin America is designed to maximize impact at low
cost. To date, this **[approach consists largely of weapons sales and
donations]{.underline}**, high level state-to-state visits, military and
police training in areas of U.S. specialization such as
counternarcotics, and financial assistance in avoiding the U.S.-based
banking system. Within international forums, Russia has used its seat on
the UN Security Council to protect Venezuela and Nicaragua from
international sanctions, and has aggressively moved to open up financial
operations---including banks and a crypto currency---to help its allies
blunt the impact of U.S. and EU sanctions. [The Russian
presence]{.underline}, increasingly accompanied by Russian organized
crime groups operating under the protection of the Russian state, [is
viewed by most U.S. stakeholders as presenting the biggest strategic
challenge]{.underline} of the three countries discussed.

### L -- Arms Transfer Treaty

#### Russia won't sign on, but will fill-in supply vacuums

**Sorensen 15** -- Juris Doctor, December 2014, J. Reuben Clark Law

[The ATT has been described as]{.underline} \"the most
[important]{.underline} \[treaty\] in the history of the United Nations
in the field of conventional arms control standards.\" 8 [But is the ATT
really the solution?]{.underline} UN Secretary General Ban Ki-[moon
opened the 2012 General Assembly stating, \"\[t\]he arms trade fuels
ill-regulated and civil conflicts,]{.underline} destabilizes regions and
expands the capabilities of terrorists and criminal networks. We do not
have a multilateral treaty on global trade in conventional arms. It\'s a
shame.\" 9 [The ATT was designed to \"prevent and eradicate\" this
problem]{.underline}; 10 [but, will it meet this goal?]{.underline}
Whenever States with principled positions attempt to reach an agreement,
some question arises as to the viability of such an agreement. 11 Not
every UN Member State 12 has faith in the ATT\'s ability \[\*239\] to
effectively address the problem. [Russia, one of the world\'s largest
dealers in arms]{.underline}, 13 [believes the ATT is no more than a
superficial Band-Aid on a deep wound]{.underline}. 14 And if Russia does
not get on board with the ATT, then how effective can it really be?
[Russia\'s justifications for abstention from signing on to the ATT have
some merit]{.underline}, as the ATT does not address arms transfers to
private parties. [However, Russia\'s justifications are also likely, in
part, a **ploy to allow Russia to transfer arms to States that might
otherwise be prohibited** under the ATT]{.underline}. [A nation
balancing conflicting interests can be tricky; such is the situation
with Russia]{.underline}, therefore justifying its abstention from the
ATT is complex.

#### Russia will remain outside the treaty system \-\-- ensures fill-in

**Sorensen 15** -- Juris Doctor, December 2014, J. Reuben Clark Law
School, Provo, UT (Joshua, "UNITED NATIONS ARMS TRADE TREATY: RUSSIA\'S
JUSTIFICATIONS FOR ABSTENTION AND THE TREATY\'S EFFECTIVENESS IN
APPLICATION, *11 BYU Int\'l L. & Mgmt. Rev. 237*, Lexis)//BB

First, many States, including [Russia]{.underline}, either [rejected the
ATT]{.underline} or abstained from joining it. 133 Additionally, the
majority of the States who are signatories to the ATT have not yet
ratified it and may avoid ratifying the treaty altogether. 134 Just as
various countries thought it unwise to join the treaty when the largest
producer and seller of weapons was rejecting the treaty, 135 [it may be
unwise to think the treaty will be effective when the second largest
producer and seller is not party to the treaty]{.underline}. [The more
countries that do not feel compelled to abide by the
ATT]{.underline}\--either because they are not party to the treaty or
because they do not feel obligated\--[will equate to **more arms
transfers occurring outside the confines of the ATT**]{.underline}. Nic
Marsh of the Peace Research Institute Oslo 136 stated, \"Having the
abstentions from two major arms exporters lessens the moral weight of
the treaty . . . . [By abstaining they]{.underline} have [left their
options open]{.underline}.\" 137

#### Russian [alone]{.underline} undercuts ATT solvency

**Sorensen 15** -- Juris Doctor, December 2014, J. Reuben Clark Law

JUSTIFICATIONS FOR ABSTENTION AND THE TREATY\'S EFFECTIVENESS IN
APPLICATION, *11 BYU Int\'l L. & Mgmt. Rev. 237*, Lexis)//BB

Additionally, the ATT will not be as effective as it could be. [Without
Russia joining the treaty, the ATT loses]{.underline} some of [its
potential effectiveness. Russia is one of the largest suppliers of arms
in the world, meaning that Russia **alone** could supply arms to many of
the States that the ATT is intended to prevent from getting
arms]{.underline}. Additionally, other States, including China, have
followed suit and avoided becoming party to the ATT. With
[so]{.underline} many [key exporting]{.underline} and importing [States
abstaining]{.underline} or objecting, [the ATT will not be able to
regulate much of the world where the need for such regulation
exists]{.underline}. Further, as long as the ATT does not regulate
transfers to non-state actors, much of the problem the treaty was
intended to address will be left unaffected by the ATT. Lastly, [even
the Member States who are party to the ATT will likely subordinate the
ATT\'s goals to their own State\'s interests]{.underline}.

### L - AT 'arms control' link turn

#### Russia will not agree to arms control

**Gressel 18** -- PhD in Strategic Studies, Senior Policy Fellow on the
Wider Europe Programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations
(ECFR). Before joining the ECFR he worked as a desk officer for
international security policy and strategy in the Bureau for Security
Policy in the Austrian Ministry of Defence (MoD) from 2006 to 2014 and

Austrian MoD from 2003 to 2006. (Gustav, "Under the gun: Rearmament for
arms control in Europe," *European Council on Foreign Relations*,
<https://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/under_the_gun_rearmament_for_arms_control_in_europe)//BB>

[The decrepitude of arms control treaties]{.underline} in Europe [is
becoming increasingly apparent at the same time as Russia continues to
act as a revisionist power. Russia's unpredictability and lack of
transparency is part of its competitive advantage. It will **therefore
not give this up** by returning to arms-control agreements of the late
cold war or negotiating new ones]{.underline}. [Arms control is an
integrated part of Russia's military strategy: to advance its own
military position while weakening that of its enemies]{.underline}. As a
result, it is open to arms-control agreements that would entrench its
military superiority in eastern Europe and prevent the technological gap
between Russia and the West from growing. This logic creates an
opportunity for the West. If Europe engages in rearmament, enhances its
militaries' combat-readiness and capacity to quickly conduct
large-scale, sustainable deployments to eastern Europe, it will deprive
Russia of its relative military superiority. Moscow will then be willing
to talk on arms control. Europeans still need to agree a common approach

[Russian arms control behavior, including the desire to limit U.S.
military capabilities through legally binding agreements while violating
those agreements]{.underline} when convenient, [is an element of
Russia's overall strategy for accomplishing Moscow's expansionist
goals]{.underline} outlined in Chapter One. [Russia sees arms control,
including noncompliance with its treaty obligations, as a tool to be
employed as necessary to obtain military advantage, convey strength,
compel respect as a superpower, deter Western challenges, enhance its
freedom of action and leverage over others, and bolster the regime's
respect and domestic legitimacy by demonstrating toughness and a
willingness to confront the West]{.underline}. [Moscow views arms
control not as a cooperative activity]{.underline} to create a more
benign world. It is another arena in which to reinforce President
Putin's statement that, "It's best not to mess with us."1 [Too often
there is a tendency in the West to dismiss individual Russian arms
control violations as mere "technical" violations that are not
"militarily significant." This approach ignores the broader role that
arms control and a policy of arms control noncompliance play in helping
Russia to achieve its **strategic objectives** and the military
capabilities possible as a result of noncompliance]{.underline}.
Soviet/[Russian arms control violations generally are not accidents,
one-time incidents, misunderstandings or legitimate disputes concerning
the technical meaning of treaty obligations]{.underline}. More often,
[they are directly related to Russian military objectives, which in turn
are related to achieving foreign policy goals such as: 1) recovering
Russia's great power status]{.underline} through enhanced nuclear
capability; [2) extending its sphere of influence over]{.underline}
(i.e., [dominating]{.underline}) [former Soviet space by enhancing
Russia's political and military power in Europe; 3) constraining U.S.
military capabilities; and, 4) undermining NATO's will and capability to
resist. If an arms control commitment]{.underline}---either legal or
political---[comes to interfere with an important Russian objective, it
is simply ignored]{.underline}. [Significantly, Russia has violated arms
control agreements even when it was clear the violations would be
detected]{.underline}.

#### Russia uses arms control to expand military power at the expense of the US

Defense Research and Engineering, Department of Defense; Director of the

[Russian arms control violations are a normal and now predictable part
of Russian practice. This arms control behavior is not ad
hoc]{.underline}, accidental, [or exist in a vacuum. It is linked to
Russian military doctrine]{.underline} and force posture goals, [which
in turn are linked to Russian foreign policy goals]{.underline}.
[Russian noncompliance is directed,]{.underline} at least in part,
[toward achieving military advantages that could help to intimidate NATO
states in peacetime and potentially defeat them in wartime]{.underline}.
Specifically, the capabilities acquired by [Russia]{.underline} as part
of its [noncompliance]{.underline} activities help
[facilitate]{.underline} and enable multiple goals, including: 1)
[recovering Russia's great power status]{.underline} (enabled by the
fear of its nuclear capabilities); 2) [extending Moscow's sphere of
influence and domination over former satellite]{.underline}
[states]{.underline} (resulting from the enhancement of Russia's
military power); 3) [constraining U.S. military
capabilities]{.underline} (exacerbated by creating monopolies in areas
where arms control has reduced or eliminated Western deterrent
capabilities); [and]{.underline} 4) [constraining NATO's will and
ability]{.underline} to counter or defend against Russian expansion by
the threat of nuclear escalation. Apparent covert [Russian nuclear
testing is a prime example of this]{.underline}. Russian nuclear weapons
are a key element of Moscow's defense policy and are seen as the basis
of Russia's great power status. Russian nuclear doctrine holds that
controlled and discriminate first use of nuclear weapons will
"de-escalate" a conventional war. Covert Russian nuclear testing may
help Russia realize such nuclear capabilities. Also largely overlooked
in today's debate is the significance of Russian noncompliance with
chemical and biological weapons treaties. Critically, Russian
noncompliance may have given Moscow a monopoly on biological and
chemical weapons in Europe that it could use or threaten to use in the
event of a major war. [Noncompliance with arms control agreements is
certainly not the sole reason for the quantitative and qualitative
growth of Soviet/Russian strategic forces. It has, however, contributed
substantially to that growth]{.underline}. [The military and political
significance of Russian arms control violations has **largely been**
**ignored** in the West]{.underline}. The military advantages are quite
considerable, especially when viewed in the context of continuing
reductions in Western nuclear and military capabilities. [Moscow's
extensive treaty violations]{.underline} may [increase both the prospect
of conflict and its consequences]{.underline}. Further, its violations
have provided Russia with key military capabilities that are highly
relevant to the current European security crisis, particularly in
Russian eyes. "Global norms" against nuclear, chemical or biological
weapons use may not impact Russian behavior in crises or conflict any
more than "global norms" against violating treaty obligations or
invading other countries and annexing their territory have prevented
Russia from doing so. In 1982, President Ronald Reagan rightly stated:
"[Simply collecting agreements will not bring peace. Agreements
genuinely reinforce peace only when they are kept. Otherwise, we are
building a paper castle that will be blown away by the winds of
war]{.underline}."107

[A smart arms]{.underline} transfer [policy would
**strangle**]{.underline} both [Russia]{.underline}, the number two
exporter, and China, which is trying to take its place.
[Russia]{.underline} in particular [needs arms exports to fund its

(not to mention hard currency for its weak economy). [It is in America's
interests to **choke off** as large a percentage of the Russian export
market as possible]{.underline} in favor of the products of more closely
aligned countries. In terms of both American influence and curbing
proliferation, it is better for countries like Malaysia and Indonesia to
buy German or South Korean submarines than Russian. [This will have the
added benefit of diminishing the quality and]{.underline}, eventually,
[raising the price of the products Russia will export to states, such as

Furthermore, [if weapons sales are the next great game, then China is
barely on the scoreboard]{.underline}. [Alarmists should recognize that
despite China's 143 percent increase in weapons sales over the last five
years, it still only represents 5 percent of the global arms
market]{.underline}. Russia, the world's second-largest producer, has a
27 percent global market share while US exports make up 31 percent. In
fact, from an economic and geopolitical perspective, Chinese weapons
sales are competing far more directly with Russian than American
transfers. Both Russia and China tend to sell weapons known for their
reliability, simplicity, and cost-effectiveness --- putting them in
competition for trade with poorer countries. On the other hand, Cliff
points out that [American foreign policy has effectively "locked up"
many major weapons markets]{.underline}, including South Korea, Israel,
and Japan. [As a result, Russia and China are left to compete for market
space]{.underline} --- and by extension, influence --- among the
nonaligned countries of the developing world. **[Even there, China is
struggling]{.underline}** to corner the market. According to the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, China is currently the
dominant arms dealer in just three African countries: South Sudan,
Tanzania, and Zambia. While weapons sales are hardly the defining factor
in the relationship between two countries, it is clear that even in
South Sudan, where China enjoys an unusually monopolistic relationship
in weapons sales, Beijing's ability to influence decision-making is
limited. In a rare divergence from an espoused policy of noninterference
in Africa, China committed 800 soldiers to South Sudan as part of a UN
peacekeeping mission. Wang Yi, China's foreign minister, said that the
commitment of troops was "the responsibility and duty of a responsible
power and not because of China's own interests." However, a report by
the research group Small Arms Survey revealed that China was also
backing a 700-strong militia in the Unity State --- South Sudan's
oil-producing region --- in order to safeguard an oil field. For
Beijing, an end to the war would be a win twice over, proving to the
world that China is capable of being a geopolitical leader while
restoring a semblance of normality conducive to trade. But despite
repeated attempts at intervention and mediation, China has struggled to
bring its influence to bear in conclusively ending the civil war. Though
[China]{.underline} [is]{.underline} still, [in many ways, taking its
first steps as a world power, its struggling aspirations]{.underline}
for responsible stewardship [in Africa are proof that economic ties are
not the sole pillar of diplomacy]{.underline}. The wariness of nations
in China's own backyard is testament to this. On account of its
vacillations between indifference and belligerence, China's foreign
policy has failed to foster trust with its neighbors. It is unclear to
what extent China has attempted to use weapons sales to cultivate
relationships with neighboring states, but its perceived aggressions in
the South China Sea have certainly had a far more negative impact on
regional relations than "friendship prices" on pistols are capable of
making up for. **[Asian nations don't turn to China]{.underline}** ---
the regional power and a country that they should have every economic
incentive to cooperate with --- [as their sole provider of
weapons.]{.underline} While many of the less wealthy Asia-Pacific
nations buy with a relative lack of distinction between the United
States, China, and Russia, the region's wealthier countries --- and
major players in the South China Sea dispute --- import their weapons
primarily from the United States. And unlike nations that share borders
with the United States and Russia, [no Chinese neighbor,]{.underline}
with the exception of Myanmar, [buys weapons in any significant quantity
from Beijing]{.underline}.

#### China needs Russia to manufacture advanced weapons \-\-- still triggers the link

**Rounds 19** -- Ph.D. candidate at Georgetown University in
International Relations (Ray, "THE CASE AGAINST ARMS EMBARGOS, EVEN FOR
SAUDI ARABIA," *War on The Rocks*,
<https://warontherocks.com/2019/04/the-case-against-arms-embargos-even-for-saudi-arabia/)//BB>

While some of the very largest industrial states, such as India or
China, might eventually create a world-leading defense industry, it will
remain out of the grasp of most states. [Consider China, an
unquestionable economic powerhouse of recent decades]{.underline}.
[Despite decades of arms purchases, technology transfer, blatant reverse
engineering attempts, and hundreds of billions of dollars, **China still
turns to Russia**]{.underline} [for help with]{.underline} the most
[advanced weaponry such as fighter jets, helicopters, surface-to-air
missiles, radars, and jet engines]{.underline}. If [China]{.underline},
the second largest economy in the world [struggles]{.underline} so
[mightily]{.underline}, what threat do smaller, less capable states
pose? Capacity transfer, the acquisition of basic scientific knowledge
and expertise crafted over decades, cannot simply be uploaded, emailed
to another state, or hacked. Rather, it takes decades of intentional and
costly investment. For high-end weaponry, where research and development
costs remain a prohibitive barrier to entry, the United States and a
handful of other advanced economies are likely to remain in the driver's
seat; even with generous technology transfer agreements.

#### The PLA will block the sale of advanced weapons

**Clifford 15** -- undergraduate @ Brown citing Roger Cliff, senior
fellow at the Atlantic Council specializing in Asian security (Edward,
"An Export to Arms: Is China's weapons trade as menacing as it seems?,"
*Brown Political Review*,
http://www.brownpoliticalreview.org/2015/11/export-to-arm-is-chinas-weapons-trade-as-menacing-as-it-seems/)//BB

[So far]{.underline}, it would seem that [the influx of Chinese weapons
has had relatively little effect on the global balance of
power]{.underline}. Even among African nations where China is the sole
supplier, Cliff points out that "these countries don't have a lot of
cash, so you're looking at a small number of weapons." But wars of the
21st Century are rarely fought with the parity of the 20th. As Chinese
weapons and weapon systems --- notably their guided missile technology
--- advance, the impact of China's dealings with more volatile
governments may start to have a larger effect, particularly in domestic
clashes, which have comprised 90 percent of the world's conflicts in the
last 25 years. While this trend may be a relative, if cynical, plus for
geopolitical stability, China's apolitical sale of weapons will continue
to fuel conflicts of the most appalling nature. However, [Cliff warns
that it is "too early to tell" what the effect of China's narrowing the
technological gap will have on the global distribution of weapon
technology, since the People's Liberation Army **continues to block**
the sale of the most advanced weapons outside of China]{.underline}.

#### Even if China captures some of the new markets, Russia [definitely]{.underline} out-competes with states that oppose China

Countries around the world routinely employ militaries to advance policy
goals in other areas. But Moscow's defence diplomacy push in the
Asia-Pacific was noteworthy because it contrasted with the low-profile
approach it took to the region in the decades after the collapse of the
Soviet Union, Muraviev said. Vostok 2018 war games: China's chance to
learn Russia's military lessons from Syria Just 6 million of Russia's
144 million people live in the country's far east, and in the past
Moscow's interests in the Asia-Pacific took a back seat to those in
Europe and the Middle East. However, as markets in Asia boomed and
economies in the West stagnated, Russia became determined to emerge as a
player in the East as well. Russia retains a marked edge with its

in 2012 -- and hastened when Russia's military actions in Crimea and
Syria prompted a flood of sanctions from the West. Yet, without the
economic dynamism of China or the US, analysts say Russia's toolset for
projecting and accumulating influence abroad is limited. Even in the
energy sector, resource-rich Russia has not kept pace in the
Asia-Pacific with exports from China, the US and other regional energy
producers. A strong military is necessary for an independent foreign
policy Vasily Kashin, a senior fellow at the National Research
University in Moscow [Russia retains a marked edge with its

top-of-the-line fighter jets and some of the quietest nuclear submarines
in the world]{.underline}. Much of this firepower is directed as a
strategic deterrent towards the US and its allies. Barring the outbreak
of major hostilities in the East, though, Russia's military assets also
serve to boost Russia's credibility as a regional power, according to
Vasily Kashin, a senior fellow at the National Research University in
Moscow. "A strong military is necessary for an independent foreign
policy," Kashin said. "And an independent foreign policy is associated
with significant economic and political benefits." Chinese military set

economic and political terms, Russia would struggle to compete outright
with China and the US. In turn, Moscow had taken a pragmatic approach to
maximise its opportunities, said Natasha Kuhrt, a war studies professor
at King's College London. Whereas Russia often played a zero-sum game in
other regions such as Europe, it broadly avoided talk of alliances in
the East, Kuhrt said. Instead, [Russia has presented itself as an

for the Philippines]{.underline}, especially as Philippine President
Rodrigo Duterte pursues his own independent foreign policy agenda,
according to Fe Apon, a Russia specialist at the Centre for
International Relations and Strategic Studies in Manila. "Duterte really
wants to develop relations with non-traditional partners for immediate,
tangible benefits," Apon said. "Russia is a natural choice in the
military area." The growing ties between Moscow and Manila were evident
in August, when the Philippine Defence Minister Delfin Lorenzana
announced plans for one of his country's warships to visit the city of
Vladivostok, home to the Russian Navy's Pacific Fleet. The port call was
billed as friendly reciprocation for recent Russian port calls in
Manila, but it will also mark a historic first for a navy that
traditionally operates closer to home. Philippine Navy band members

policy expectations on would-be partners or clients -- such as a
government's attitude to human rights -- Russia has few preconditions
about other countries' domestic affairs. [This was a key selling point
for Indonesia]{.underline}, according to Evan Laksmana, a senior
researcher at the Jakarta-based Centre for Strategic and International
Studies. Indonesia is a former client state of the Soviet Union, and
Laksmana said the country's legacy familiarity with Russian equipment
contributed to Russia's desirability as a partner. Moscow also offers
flexible financial terms on sales, including "soft loans" that carry

Largely as an inheritance from its Soviet past, [Russia has little to
export other than arms and raw materials]{.underline}, because it can no
longer afford to transfer arms freely as did the Soviet Union for many
years. Arms sales are now driven by profits more than purely ideological
interests. At the same time, [Russia's desire to court favor among
anti-Western states is a major factor in its]{.underline} foreign [arms
sales policy]{.underline}. Even though economic necessity is the
fundamental driver behind Russia's promotion of arms sales, it is not at
the expense of foreign policy interests. As long as the political price
is not prohibitive, Russia will pursue lucrative arms sales, even at the
cost of incurring the displeasure of the West. As ideological
considerations have yielded to economic interests in arms sales,
[Russia]{.underline} still [continues to mix foreign policy with arms
sale contracts]{.underline}. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the
oil and gas industry replaced the military industry in importance to the
state, however, [arms sales]{.underline} still [provide important
revenue for the state and are considered a valuable instrument in
conducting foreign policy]{.underline}. [From the initiatives set forth
by Putin, the arms export industry reemerged as one of the primary tools
to advance Russia's national security interests]{.underline}. In 2012,
Putin himself stated, "We see active military technical cooperation
(military exports) as an effective instrument for advancing our national
interests, both political and economic. Growing demand for the goods our
defense industry and related sectors produce brings more money into our
state budget and creates new jobs."25 [This]{.underline} statement
[indicates Putin's desire to]{.underline} not only improve the defense
industry and domestic economy, but to [advance Russia's political
interests through its state arms export program]{.underline}. Hence,
[Putin's military export strategy is inextricably linked to Russia's
overall national security objectives to support its image as a great
power, maintain an independent]{.underline} 10 [foreign policy free from
Western influence, and expand its own influence and political ties with
countries disgruntled or at odds with the West]{.underline}.26 [Putin

reestablishing Russia as a world power. A strong defense industry and
prolific export industry]{.underline} not only represents an image of

industry **is increasingly dependent** on export sales to]{.underline}
emerging and stagnant markets, with [countries **looking for
alternatives to Western manufacturers**]{.underline}. In order to gain
access and political influence into new markets, Russia has resorted to
using economic agreements, barter deals, debt forgiveness, and offset
contracts to promote arms sales around the world.27 With these
practices, Russia has increased its ability to influence and promote
Russian interests.

also socially important, as it accounts for a significant share of

for over 3 per cent of total employment, and around one-third of
employment in manufacturing, with defence-industrial research and

Abstract

Reminiscent of the Soviet era, [military arms exports have once again
become a major instrument for projecting Russian power and influence,
and are integral in]{.underline} bolstering a fragile economy and
[offsetting the damages caused by Western sanctions]{.underline}.
Russia's involvement in the Syrian War on behalf of Bashar Al-Assad
indicates a growing primacy of Putin's willingness to take calculated
risks within the Russian sphere of influence and to use military exports
as a political tool to achieve national security interests. In Syria,
Russia utilized its military exports to enhance its image as a world
power, maintain access, and counter Western influence in the Middle
East. In addition to sending advanced weaponry to Syria, Russia
showcased its military hardware against Western made weapons, sending a
clear signal of Russian reliability and sophistication to nations
wanting to upgrade, purchase or diversify their military inventory. [The
state owned and controlled Russian defense industry remains a
fundamental instrument of national power and supports the achievement of

an important aspect]{.underline} to understanding the potential [for
future Russian adventurism]{.underline}. Hence, future Russian military
expansion in what it considers its sphere of influence, [with Putin's

through looking at Russia's defense export sales. [The inextricable link

Thesis

This paper argues that [Russia has returned to a pseudo-Soviet style
practice of utilizing arms sales as a political instrument to further
its national security objectives.]{.underline} Moreover, this paper
argues part of Russia's decision to commit forces into Syria was to
showcase their military hardware to the world, thereby renewing interest
in purchasing arms. This, in turn, provided Russia additional
opportunities to expand their influence and counter the West. Finally,
this paper argues [there is an **inextricable link** between foreign
military sales and]{.underline} the potential for **[future Russian
adventurism]{.underline}**. [Understanding this link is]{.underline} an
[important]{.underline} aspect [to avoid strategic surprise the next
time Russia commits military forces in its self-proclaimed sphere of
influence]{.underline}.

[The global balance of power is in transition. A global order that was
established after World War II and the collapse of Soviet Union is now
evolving and often dysfunctional]{.underline}. [We are witnessing the
expansion of a multipolar world, and the risk of conflict is
intensifying due to]{.underline} an increase in the number of
[influential players around the world]{.underline}. Ukraine is at the
epicenter of these changes and the interests of many of the world's
major powers. It is the key to balancing Russia's global ambitions.
Since its military aggression in Ukraine in 2014, and even earlier,
starting with its war with Georgia, Russia has continuously tried to
destabilize and diminish the global-security system. This was done with
only one aim: for Russia to reassert itself under a new post--Soviet
sphere of influence with new borders, both physical and psychological.
President Vladimir Putin made this clear in 2007 during his speech at
the Munich Security Conference, where he complained that "the United
States has overstepped its national borders, and in every area." Of the
tools Russia uses to gain geopolitical influence, the most crucial is
the "diffusion of tactics." These tactics involve various methods of
influence, ranging from military conflicts to the manipulation of
national political and economic systems through disinformation and
proxies, as well as cyber warfare. Faced with such threats, Western
political and security systems are vulnerable. Democracy requires public
trust and a bureaucratic consensus to survive. Putin knows this, which
is why he has sought to undermine these pillars of democratic stability.
Similarly, the United States and its allies should respond to the
Kremlin's challenges by attacking Russia where it is most vulnerable:
its exports of fossil fuels and exports of weapons. In the oil and gas
sector, the West has been assertive in countering Russian aggression by
sanctioning Russia's energy industry and exporting shale oil and gas
from the United States. But in the defense industry and defense trade,
on the other hand, there has not been the same level of action by the
West. This is where Ukraine has a critical role to play. There are just
a few countries in the world that have full cycles of defense
production. Only the United States, France, Russia, China, and Ukraine
cover virtually all technological capabilities in the defense space.
**[Russia's arms trade poses threats to global security]{.underline}**.
[The Kremlin uses defense technical cooperation as a means to achieve
its geopolitical]{.underline} goals. [Moscow pursued this policy during
the Cold War by dividing the world into sectors of strategic
influence]{.underline}. [Back then, the United States was the
counterweight to this destructive Soviet strategy, and it **must once
again assume this role**]{.underline}.

This is not to suggest that [Russia]{.underline} should be written off
or ignored. The economy is resilient, as it has demonstrated in
weathering two recent crises. It [is]{.underline} also [of a size and
with a resource endowment such as to encourage it to conceive of itself
as a great power]{.underline}. [In trying to turn conception into
reality it can be aggressive and disruptive of the established world
order]{.underline}. That produces two challenges for [the
West.]{.underline} The first is to arrive at a realistic understanding
of what it [can]{.underline} do, either in the direction of providing
the assistance that would allow the Russian economy to do better, or ---
more topically at the moment --- in the direction of
[restrict]{.underline}ing [economic performance and thereby Russia's
capacity to meet its great power ambitions]{.underline}. In either
direction the West's capacity is limited. The West cannot turn Russia
into a balanced and booming economy; nor can it undermine the economy
and through it Russia's political leadership to the point of irrelevance
and collapse. But even [limited capacity is important]{.underline}. [The
West might not be able to transform the Russian economy, but within
limits it **can play a role** in determining where Russia is on the
great power spectrum]{.underline}. That leads to the second challenge:
what should the West do? That depends on whether one believes Russian
movement along the great power spectrum to be a good or a bad thing. [If
the West feels that Russia's current place on the spectrum is cause for
disquiet]{.underline} and any further movement along it undesirable,
[the capacity to increase the cost to Russia exists and should be
used]{.underline}.

Russian President Vladimir [Putin is mighty proud of his military's
performance in Syria]{.underline}. And, as I have written, [it's become
a central part of a sales pitch: "You can't miss this opportunity to
strengthen our position in the global arms market]{.underline},\" he
told a meeting of Russian defence companies this week. He added that
there was unprecedented desire for buying Russian munitions "thanks to
the effective use of our weapons in real combat conditions including in
anti-terrorist operations in Syria.\" [But while Putin talks a proud
game, it's hard not hear a tinge of desperation here.]{.underline}
[That's because, after years of phenomenal growth, the exports of
Russian-made arms have **stagnated**]{.underline}. [And it couldn't have
come at a worse time, with oil prices devastating the economy in the
midst of a massive military buildup **dependent in large part on those
foreign sales**]{.underline}. Arms exports are a tricky thing to
measure. According to one of the leading experts on the subject, Sergey
Denisentsev, after nearly tripling global sales from 2005 to 2013,
Russia has seen them drop or hold steady each year since. At a recent
forum at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in
Washington, Denisentsev gave some reasons for the Kremlin's struggles.
At the top of the list are changes in military procurement in China and
India, which traditionally counted for about half of Russia's exports.
But there was a downside to those sales: the Chinese in particular are
masters at appropriating the expertise of others, and have now adapted
Russian technology to domestically built planes and ships. "In some ways
the student has already surpassed the teacher,\" said Denisentsev.
India, the world's top buyer, is also building more of its own
equipment. Its first aircraft carrier, the Vikramaditya, was built in
the 1980s by the Soviet Union and purchased in 2004 off the Russian junk
heap. But its second, the Vikrant, is the first in a planned class of
carriers to be built domestically. A deal between the countries to
jointly build a fifth-generation fighter jet have been delayed for seven
years over Indian unhappiness with various Russian proposals. Meanwhile,
the country increasingly finds itself in the US orbit, and this month
reached a deal for \$2 billion in various arms with Israel. Vietnam,
another major market, has been opened to US competition since last year,
when President Barack Obama lifted the ban on sales there. Meanwhile,
low oil prices have hurt Russia indirectly as well as directly. Its big
customers like Algeria and Nigeria have signed contracts for a handful
of planes, but are hardly on a spending spree because their own oil
revenue has dried up. Azerbaijan, a top customer, cut arms imports by
36%. Iran, even freed of many Western sanctions after an international
deal for nuclear monitoring, has a shambles of an economy. And Syria, of
course, has turned from a customer to a charity case---or at best, a
proving ground. The state-controlled Russian press claims there is
interest in fighter sales from several South American countries, but
there's no proof this is anything more than propaganda. Spending in that
region has fallen to its lowest level since 2007. It's hard to believe
Venezuela, where citizens go months without basics such as milk and
eggs, is about to splurge on a bunch of \$37 million Su-30 fighters. A
final problem, as pointed out by Marcus Weisgerber at Defense One, is
that [Russia is struggling to churn out desirable products]{.underline}
in an age of high-tech weaponry. Traditionally, [Moscow has left the top
end of the market to the US]{.underline} and other Western producers,
while focusing on what Denisentsev called "cheap and deadly\" weapons
within the price range of buyers in the developing world. But as former
clients like China and India get wealthier, Russia is being forced to go
upscale. And in developing next-generation jets and missile-defense
systems, [Moscow is losing its competitive advantage. Given American
companies' superior reputations and track records, it makes less and
less sense for aspiring powers to buy Russian]{.underline}. [**The
real-world effect is clear**: After a decade-long military expansion
intended to solidify its rank as a global superpower, **Russia is
slashing its defense budget by as much as 25%**]{.underline} this year.
(Other estimates put the figure below 10%, but either way, it is a sea
change.) [Putin has reason to crow about his military's performance so
far in Syria, but it's not going to do much for his bottom
line]{.underline}.

### IL -- AT aggression inevitable

#### Future adventurism is uncertain \-\-- it's constrained by limited economic capability

**Silwinski 15** -- MA in IR @ UGA (Michael, "Russia's Aggressive
Foreign Policy," *Law Street*,
<https://lawstreetmedia.com/issues/world/russias-aggressive-foreign-policy/)//BB>

Many Russians also believe the entire uprising in Ukraine is the result
of Western actions. A common argument is that Russia has actually
intervened to protect Russian speakers the same as many western
countries do for other minority groups. However, the opinions of
everyday Russians are heavily influenced by the Russian media, which is
indiscriminately run by the state and thus broadcasts the state's
message. **[Russia's next course of action remains up in the
air]{.underline}**. [Economically it would seem obvious that Russia has
to stop being so aggressive and work toward appeasing its Western
creditors]{.underline} and consumers. [Economic sanctions]{.underline}
placed on Russia following its actions in Ukraine [are beginning to be
felt]{.underline}. The main effects of the sanctions have been in
denying Russia credit and access to markets. Nonetheless, as yet another
breached ceasefire implies, Russia doesn't seem content to return
Eastern Ukraine--and certainly not Crimea--back to the original status
quo. Other Foreign Policy Concerns for Russia Along with sanctions, [an
even greater problem for Russia suggests it should curtail its recent
aggressive maneuvering--falling oil prices]{.underline}. At the
beginning of the year, the price of oil dropped below \$50 a barrel.
This is devastating to a Russian economy that is dependent on oil as its
main export. From an economic standpoint this has been disastrous to the
ruble, which has dropped by 17.5 percent compared to the dollar in just
the first two weeks of 2015. The economy in general is hurting, as well,
as it's projected to retract by three to five percent this year. What
this means for people on the street is also troubling. Lower crude
prices mean higher prices for other goods, in particular food stuffs.
[All of these economic woes have negatively impacted another grand Putin
endeavor, the Eurasian Union]{.underline}. As the name implies, it is an
economic union made up of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Armenia, and
Kyrgyzstan that is supposed to rival the EU. However, with falling
prices in Russia and declining currencies at home, all of the members
are already discovering the side effects of allying with a troubled
Russia. The member countries are also wary of sovereignty violations by
Russia as well, similar to the ones that have already occurred in
Georgia, Crimea, and now Eastern Ukraine. It seems unlikely that Russia
will stop pursuing such an aggressive approach, however. As a de facto
dictator, it is crucial for Putin that he keeps his people happy enough
so that they will not revolt. In this regard Putin seems to have been
very successful. In December 2014 he was elected Russia's Man of the
Year for the fifteenth time in a row. Putin's popularity level in fact
has hovered at around 70 percent his entire time in office, spiking even
higher during the invasion of Georgia and following the annexation of
Crimea. It actually seems to Putin's benefit to maintain his strong
appearance in the face of alleged western aggression. While people in
the West may question the authenticity of these ratings, any western
politician would love to have the same kind of popularity. Putin has
also increased spending on the military. Even with the economy in
crisis, military spending actually increased for this year rising to
\$50 billion. The effect of this spending has been evident in increased
navy patrols, air maneuvers, improved equipment and greater activity. It
also included the purchase of dozens of new state-of-the-art nuclear
weapons to replace obsolete models from the Cold War. So, Russia's
policies are working, at least in part. While they have proven very
costly to the average Russian and the economy overall, it has not
dissuaded Putin from his desire to restore Russian prestige. Frankly it
should not be surprising either, with his high approval ratings and the
West's resistance to anything more than soft power tactics. **[The real
question going forward is how much further Russia will go down this
path.]{.underline}** [Will it stop with Eastern Ukraine or go
further]{.underline} and risk overstretching? At some point the West
will likely draw a line in the sand and if Russia crosses it, what will
be next for Russia and the international community it refuses to abide
by?

[The United States is so economically advantaged in making and selling
weapons that it can limit conventional-weapons proliferation, technology
diffusion, and corruption in contracting arrangements]{.underline} (and
maintain a robust defense industrial base) [while retaining its
commanding market position]{.underline}. [Less powerful exporting states
are]{.underline} generally [too constrained by the economics of
production to pursue any goals besides increased sales]{.underline}.
There are a number of ways in which [America's leverage in the area of
arms sales]{.underline} --- and, therefore, its ability to exercise
restraint --- [can further its foreign policy goals]{.underline}. Lower
Levels of Corruption Lead to More Capability America's ability to walk
away from any given arms deal helps reduce several bad behaviors endemic
to the global arms trade. Three-quarters of all international arms
transfers go to countries that, according to Transparency International,
score a "D" or worse in terms of anti-corruption measures in their
defense sectors. Almost two-thirds of American exports go to such
countries, but compare this to the other leading arms dealers. France is
76 percent and the United Kingdom is 85 percent. Russia and China do not
export to any clients graded above a "D." An identical story emerges
when we look at exports to human rights abusers. [The U.S.
military-industrial complex may appear to be a collection of
rent-seeking, war-profiteering, influence-peddling, threat-inflating
sociopaths **until you look at nearly every other country's
version**]{.underline}. [The United States sells most of its weapons
through its Foreign Military Sales program,]{.underline} which
essentially adds foreign orders onto preexisting ones for U.S. forces.
[Foreign Military Sales plays an **unheralded role in global
anticorruption efforts**, since clients pay the same price as the U.S.
military, and most of the contracting is handled by the Department of
Defense]{.underline}. Because the combined domestic and international
orders tend to be large, [economies of scale]{.underline} also [drive
down the cost for foreign clients, which makes for an attractive value
proposition, even with many American strings attached]{.underline}. [By
contrast, when dealing with less stringent regulations in other
countries, buyers are likely to encounter corruption]{.underline} ---
[side payments to "agents" and bribes to officials]{.underline} ---
which ensures the purchasing state is not getting the best value for its
money. [This in turn undermines a fundamental goal of U.S. arms
transfers: enabling partners to provide their own security and to
potentially fight effectively alongside U.S. forces]{.underline}.
Loosening American regulations to increase arms sales may not only
increase corruption levels, but also reduce the value of the product
bought by U.S. allies and partners, making their militaries less
capable.

Russia's Arms Sales to the Middle East," *Jamestown Foundation*,
<https://jamestown.org/program/tactical-side-russias-arms-sales-middle-east/)//BB>

Why Choose a Russian Weapon?

[When countries prefer Russian weaponry]{.underline} over American
systems, [it is usually for evident reasons]{.underline}. **[The U.S.
will not sell weapons to many of Russia's clients]{.underline}** for a
variety of reasons. Russian weaponry is relatively inexpensive and,
generally speaking, often more robust than comparable American systems.
[In some areas, Moscow's systems lag]{.underline} severely behind the
U.S. in terms of quality and capabilities, [but in others, it is a
near-peer competitor]{.underline}. For instance, Moscow is quite good at
building anti-aircraft missiles, such as the S-300 and S-400 systems,
based on lessons-learned from the Kosovo Air War. The American F-35
joint strike fighter can likely currently beat an S-400 (although there
is no way to know for sure unless they engage in direct combat).
However, Moscow is developing the next generation, the S-500, whose full
capabilities are unknown. Russian current-generation aircraft and
ballistic missile defenses are on par with those of the U.S. in terms of
defense technology. Some Russian missiles have as long a range as
American missiles, a few of them even longer. \[xiv\] In addition, the
U.S. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) system is very slow, bureaucratic and
cumbersome, while Moscow takes less time to deliver after a contract is
signed. [Moscow is weak when it comes to follow-up support of
sales]{.underline}, and Russian weaponry is not always as technically
advanced as America's, [but it is good enough for the needs of many
markets, and is often far better than what the purchasing countries can
build themselves]{.underline}. Russian weaponry is also a good choice
for states on a budget. Moscow advertises this fact. For example, in
early October 2015, days after Russia's Syria intervention, Moscow fired
26 cruise missiles from primarily small corvettes in the Caspian Sea to
hit targets in Syria.\[xv\] Moscow made a public display of the event,
not only to demonstrate Russia's own might but also to show other
countries they need not purchase a large expensive warship to achieve
strong naval capabilities, and that Moscow would be happy to help them
achieve this goal. Another practical consideration is that many local
military personnel in the MENA region have trained on Russian weaponry
and feel comfortable operating it. As one American source familiar with
the situation explained it, "If you have an AK-47, why change to an
M-16?"\[xvi\] For example, helicopters are especially crucial to Egypt's
anti-Islamist campaign; and according to first-hand pilot accounts,
Russia' less expensive helicopters fit Egypt's needs well. Overall,
Russian attack helicopters are not necessarily superior technologically,
but they bring heavy firepower to a fight. They may fare worse in a
contested air space, but the Sinai airspace is not contested. The
Russian MiG-29 is a highly advanced aircraft, easier to maintain than an
American one, and cheaper than an F-22\[xvii\] (which the U.S. is
currently not even exporting). [Beyond these advantages, Russian
weaponry comes with few strings attached, in contrast to arms sales from
Washington. Moscow, unlike the U.S., **does not prohibit secondary arms
sales**. This means, for example, that when the U.S. sells weapons to
Egypt, the weapon must stay in Egypt]{.underline}.\[xviii\] [But in
Egypt's context, buying a Russian weapon it can **easily resell** to
someone else for profit may be a preferable option]{.underline}.

the CAT policy requires that every sale be assessed for the risk it may

immutable American value, so let me repeat myself: we will not provide
arms where we believe they will be used to conduct a gross violation of
human rights. For sure, there can be complexities in any sale: for
instance, not all of our partners are as discriminating as we ourselves
are when it comes to the conduct of their military operations. For that
reason, the new CAT policy requires us to work proactively with partners
to reduce civilian casualties in their military operations. We also
regularly use sales as an opportunity to engage with partners to address
the human rights conduct of their military. These are often imperfect
situations, but we always work to reduce the chance of the misuse of
U.S. arms; the same simply cannot be said for most other suppliers of
military equipment. [In terms of proliferation, we]{.underline} also
work to [strike a balance between providing our partners with the
capabilities they need to defend themselves and ensure regional
stability while **limiting the proliferation of new military
technologies** and creating regional imbalances that can lead to an arms
race]{.underline}. In doing so, [we work within the context of the
multilateral regimes to which the U.S. is a party]{.underline}. That
does not mean that some of these regimes do not need updating: for
instance, the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), designed to
prevent the proliferation of missiles, never took into account the role
that unmanned aerial systems now play in both the military and
commercial realms. [In reviewing each sale on a case-by-case basis,
we]{.underline} must [ensure that we are not accelerating the spread of
advanced weaponry and creating opportunities for our
competitors]{.underline} -- economic and strategic -- [to expand the
space for their own defense trade, to our ultimate military and economic
detriment]{.underline}.

[American strategy in the arms trade consists of selling a few
high-technology and ultra-expensive weapon systems to clients that can
pay for them]{.underline}, like the oil producing states. That strategy
may maximize the short-run interests of the industry and the U.S. armed
services, but is it consistent with America's long-run interests? Unlike
many sectors, the arms trade has both an economic and security function
to fill. From an economic standpoint, foreign weapon sales not only keep
workers employed at home, but by extending production lines, can lower
unit costs for the platforms the U.S. armed forces require. [From an
American security perspective, arms sales are a vital tool of influence,
since countries that acquire weapons from Washington are less likely to
use them in a way that would jeopardize future access to American
defense technology. By monopolizing arms sales, the U.S. can also limit
the number of advanced weapons on the world market]{.underline}.

horrific casualties, [neither country's population is likely to be
completely destroyed **by the direct effects of the
blast**]{.underline}, fire, and radiation.8 [The [aftermath could
be]{.mark} **much [worse]{.mark}**]{.underline}: the
[burning]{.underline} of [flammable materials [could send
massive]{.mark} amounts of [smoke into the

-- **[[a nuclear winter]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

According to one model 9 , [an all-out exchange of 4,000
weapons]{.underline}10 [could lead to a drop in global temperatures of
around 8°C, making it **impossible to grow food for**]{.underline} 4 to
[**5 years**. This could leave some survivors]{.underline} in parts of

nuclear weapons]{.underline}, with stockpiles of around 4,500 warheads

suggest that even [[a small regional nuclear war]{.mark} involving 100

civilisation. It should be emphasised that there is very large
uncertainty about the effects of a large nuclear war on global climate.
This remains an area where increased academic research work, including
more detailed climate modelling and a better understanding of how
survivors might be able to cope and adapt, would have high returns.

[It is]{.underline} very [difficult to precisely estimate the

war]{.underline} at present [is between India and
Pakistan]{.underline}.14 [However, [given the relatively modest size of

**[plausibly greater]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} a [conflict between the

increased in recent years and it seems unreasonable to rule out the
possibility of them rising further in the future.

### ! -- revisionism / war

#### Russia will pursue [revisionist expansionism]{.underline} as long as it has the [economic capacity]{.underline} to do so \-\-- [leads to war]{.underline}

Defense and Strategic Studies @ Mo State, \*\*John, PhD, Director of

crisis and conflict," *Comparative Strategy*, 36.1)

[Russia's]{.underline} domestic political [system under Putin is
oriented to expansionist policies and is predicated on recasting Russia
as a de facto empire. The inherent revisionism of Russian policy and its
fundamental anti-liberalism makes anti-Americanism the default option of
Russian policy]{.underline}. Cooperation, where possible is tactical and
instrumental, not a result of a strategic rapprochement. This applies to
arms control accords where Moscow feels free to break inconvenient
agreements. [Russia's overall security policies begin with the
presupposition of conflict with most of its interlocutors and thus
entails a consistent bias toward the militarization of its domestic and
foreign policies]{.underline}. Domestic dissent is equated to treason by
fifth columnists linked to external enemies and virtually all elements
of domestic policy are viewed through this prism.71 [Given these
continuing and strongly rooted factors, Russia's conventional and
nuclear buildup will continue **as long as Russia can afford
it**]{.underline} and Putin retains power, even if he must ratchet back
the level or scope of this buildup as a result of economic pressures.
[The dangerous threat environment]{.underline} for the West described
above [will not change unless there are dramatic changes]{.underline} in
Russia's expansionist goals and Russia's willingness to use any and all
forms of pressure to advance them, i.e., Russia's grand strategy. Absent
such a change in Russia's strategic goals, U.S. and NATO conciliatory
behavior/actions are likely to present an image of disunity and
indecision, and thereby potentially provoke further Russian
belligerence. [The usual Western hope that arms control will address
threats and relieve it of the need to respond more forcefully appears
particularly fanciful now. Putin is little interested in new arms
control and is manifestly willing to violate existing
agreements]{.underline}. As will be discussed in Chapters Two and Five,
Russia has systematically violated the Helsinki Final Act, all the
treaties with Ukraine and other CIS governments on the inviolability of
borders, and the 1994 Budapest Accord with Washington, London and Kiev
on Ukraine's denuclearization; it also has broken the INF treaty, the
CFE treaty (Conventional Forces in Europe) and its political promises in
the Presidential Nuclear Initiatives. Unfortunately, [abundant evidence
points to the continuing mobilization of Russia for a long-term state of
siege with the West, if not actual war]{.underline}, as Moscow continues
to insist that it is secure only if all its interlocutors are not. A
mobilization policy initiated by 2009 has greatly accelerated since
2013. If Russia cannot escape from the Putin regime's anti-Western
hostility and insistence upon hegemony, [the ensuing state of siege will
be a source of crises and conflict for years]{.underline}. [Perhaps most
dangerous is the fact that Putin is not a magician who can control the
nationalism and militarism he has inflamed]{.underline}. As the
then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey said in
July 2014, "If I have a fear about this it's that [Putin may actually
light a fire that he loses control of]{.underline}."72 Indeed, [**crises
and conflict** are the **logical consequences of Putin's expansionist
grand strategy**]{.underline}.

#### Russian expansionism leads to nuclear use

**Payne** and Foster **17** -- \*Keith, PhD in IR @ USC, Professor of
Defense and Strategic Studies @ Mo State, \*\*John, PhD, Director of
Defense Research and Engineering, Department of Defense; Director of the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ("Russian strategy Expansion,
crisis and conflict," *Comparative Strategy*, 36.1)//BB

Russian nuclear and conventional force programs and Russia grand
strategy [Russia clearly attributes]{.underline} political and military
[value to]{.underline} its nuclear arsenal, and the threat of limited
[nuclear]{.underline} [first use]{.underline} more specifically, as a
means to support its efforts to reassert its dominance over the
post-Soviet space. Moscow's strategy is intended to intimidate neighbors
and deter outside interference in Russian activities through the threat
of nuclear first use. [Russia's]{.underline} apparently [low nuclear
threshold raises the stakes in any conflict]{.underline}, and compels
adversaries to confront the possibility that should they become
involved, so too would Russian nuclear weapons. This has been
prominently displayed throughout hostilities in Ukraine, as Russian
nuclear exercises, official statements, and bomber patrols are intended
to intimidate Western states. First and foremost, Russia's strategy
couples multidimensional operations with overt nuclear threats for the
purpose of precluding retaliation by the aggrieved party and/or its
allies---thus giving Russia a free hand to pursue its expansionist
goals. Moscow seeks this seemingly ultimate trump card within its "near
abroad." This use of nuclear weapons is not a replay of Cold War notions
of mutual nuclear deterrence. It is a strategy of nuclear coercion to
support expansionist goals. As noted in Chapter Three, Deputy Commander
of NATO Forces in Europe General Sir Adrian Bradshaw, concluded in this
regard that Russia's "threat of escalation might be used to prevent
reestablishment of territorial integrity."125 Acclaimed Russian analyst
Pavel Felgenhauer agreed, suggesting [Moscow is becoming comfortable
with using the threat of nuclear war to]{.underline} "[scare the
West]{.underline} into concessions."126 This continued approach could
lead to an "emboldened Russia brandishing nuclear weapons each time it
wants something."127 Despite describing its policy as purely defensive,
it is clear that Russia considers nuclear coercion as a great power
instrument to be leveraged during periods of hostilities to protect a
potential fait accompli. If, as seems to be the case, Moscow views this
as a viable strategy, Russia may continue to act more aggressively
toward post-Soviet states, potentially including the eastern portion of
NATO, backed up by nuclear threats. At the very least, if the Kremlin
feels threatened, it will display its nuclear sabre to escalate the
conflict to a nuclear level others would simply be unwilling to match.
During a meeting at the Valdai Club in October 2014, Putin himself gave
a history lesson on the power of nuclear intimidation, stating: True,
the Soviet Union was referred to as "the Upper Volta with missiles."
Maybe so, and there were loads of missiles. Besides, we had such
brilliant politicians like Nikita Khrushchev, who hammered the desk with
his shoe at the UN. And the whole world, primarily the United States,
and NATO thought: this Nikita is best left alone, he might just go and
fire a missile, they have lots of them, we should better show some
respect for them.128 [The danger in this Russian view is obvious:
nuclear brinks]{.underline}man[ship]{.underline} [could trigger a chain
of events that leads to a nuclear]{.underline} confrontation or
[conflict]{.underline}.129 [Should a confident and "bold" Putin severely
miscalculate]{.underline} a NATO response, [he could believe nuclear
escalation of a conflict to be a viable option]{.underline}. In
addition, if a conflict erupts, Russia's flexible and discriminate
nuclear systems may afford Moscow the ability to frustrate NATO
war-planning. By employing specific, specialized systems against
high-value target sets, such as aircraft carriers, critical command and
control nodes, and long-range air bases, Russia could effectively carry
out an offset strategy using both non-nuclear and nuclear means to
negate NATO's conventional superiority by destroying the alliance's most
prized assets. This could cause enormous losses for NATO military
personal and infrastructure, and constrain NATO's ability to conduct
offensive operations to dislodge an occupying Russian force. As is
intended, Moscow's threat to use nuclear weapons could result in
coercive pressure to prevent certain conventional NATO actions during
the course of a conflict as well---essentially a form of intra-war
nuclear coercion.130 This could consist of nuclear threats to prevent
NATO from targeting supply hubs, air bases, or sophisticated air and
missile defenses located just inside Russia's borders, which could be
critical targets during an operation to remove Russian forces. By
threatening nuclear escalation, Moscow could force NATO to choose
between limiting its response or nuclear war. Thus, NATO must prepare
for not just a miscalculated Russian nuclear strike, but a calculated
one as well. Finally, should deterrence fail and a crisis escalate,
Russian leaders could believe that limited nuclear use would localize
and terminate a conflict on advantageous terms, as is suggested by its
nuclear escalation strategy. Moscow appears to believe that it can
control escalation by restraining the types of nuclear weapons used,
their targets, and under what circumstances each weapon is used, while
threatening the possibility of further nuclear escalation, up to global
nuclear war. Essentially, by credibly threatening to break the long
revered nuclear taboo, Russia appears to anticipate being able to coerce
NATO into submission or acquiescence to Russian domination of the
post-Soviet space. In short, Russian nuclear strategy envisions the
threat of and possible employment of nuclear weapons to achieve military
and political objectives. As Sergei Ivanov once told the state Duma, "As
regard to use of nuclear weapons in case of aggression, of course \[we
will use them in this case\]. What else were they built for?131 The
Times of London reported in April 2015 that retired Russian generals,
who had been briefed by Ivanov and approved by Putin, met with a group
of retired U.S. generals and warned that if NATO builds up its forces in
the Baltics, Russia would respond by increasing its "nuclear posture"
and that, "Russia will use its nuclear weapons against NATO."132
However, the core of Russia's nuclear strategy does not appear to
anticipate a general nuclear war with NATO. The Kremlin appears to
believe that NATO's greatest strength is also its most exploitable
weakness: dependence on unanimity among its 28 members.133 Following the
great Chinese strategist Sun Tzu's teaching on the value of disrupting
an enemy's alliances, Russian limited nuclear use threats appear
intended to divide NATO by threatening greater destruction and loss
should the bloc fail to yield during a conflict. The Russian leadership
appears to assume that French, British, American, and German leaders
will be divided in their willingness to risk nuclear retaliation over
distant regions such as Warsaw, Narva, or Daugavpils. As U.S. Amb.
Robert Joseph has noted, "Russia's doctrine assumes an asymmetry of
interests and a lack of willingness on the part of the enemy to risk
nuclear war (emphasis added)."134 A fundamental component of Russia's
nuclear strategy is to challenge NATO's resolve. Indeed, the Russian
leadership has seemingly come to see limited nuclear threats as a viable
policy option specifically fashioned to challenge NATO, based on the
presumption that most NATO members ultimately will be unwilling to
defend their Eastern-most allies in the face of Russian nuclear
escalation threats.135 Conclusion The Russian leadership undoubtedly
views nuclear weapons as an essential coercive instrument to accomplish
both political and military objectives related to securing Moscow's
goals. By developing a spectrum of nuclear threats and capabilities, and
a strategy to employ nuclear weapons, Russia clearly backstops its
expansionist campaigns. Whether it be covering hybrid operations,
intimidating European states, or potentially employing nuclear strikes
to defeat a conventionally superior adversary, [nuclear]{.underline}
[weapons and the threat of their use are likely to]{.underline} remain,
if not [grow]{.underline}, [in importance for Russia]{.underline}. In
short, Russia's nuclear strategy is in line with the Putin regime's
worldview and grand strategy discussed in Chapter One, the goal of which
is to establish a new Eurasian security order based on Russian hegemony
at the expense of NATO, and more importantly, the United States. More
disturbingly, [the Kremlin appears to believe that actual nuclear
employment is a realistic option in support of expansion. Should Putin
determine a major confrontation probable, he could conclude that
launching a limited nuclear strike would be an advantageous option.
Given Putin's]{.underline} apparent [propensity]{.underline} [for
risk-taking and his absolute desire to reestablish a greater Russia, he
could find himself in a situation where he greatly
miscalculates]{.underline} either his own forces' abilities or NATO's
willingness to capitulate. If Russia's nuclear exercises are an
indication, [the threat of Russian nuclear first use is **real** in
a]{.underline} European [contingency that is itself the result of
**Russian expansionism and aggression**]{.underline}.

**Payne 17** -- PhD in IR @ USC, Professor of Defense and Strategic
Studies @ Mo State (Keith, "Russian strategy Expansion, crisis and
conflict," *Comparative Strategy*, 36.1)//BB

This monograph, Russian Strategy: Expansion, Crisis and Conflict, is
based on readily-available and open sources of information, particularly
including numerous Russian publications. [Russian foreign military
actions, defense initiatives, markedly expanded conventional and nuclear
arms programs, internal repression, and egregious arms control
non-compliance appear to be elements of an increasingly assertive and
threatening agenda]{.underline}. In this text, we call out and examine
the apparent grand strategy underlying Russian policies, programs and
behavior. This examination demonstrates that [Russian grand strategy now
includes a deeply-troubling mix of ingredients: increasing hostility
toward the West, including expressed military threats]{.underline} via
statements and nuclear exercises directed against the United States and
NATO countries; [expanding programs to produce advanced weapons and
delivery vehicles, conventional and nuclear; revisions in military
doctrine that place greater emphasis on the employment of nuclear
weapons, including first use; military campaigns against neighboring
states; the first annexation of European territory]{.underline} by
military force [since World War II; increasing military-oriented
incursions in U.S., Canadian, European and Japanese air space; arms
control noncompliance; and increasing domestic repression and
authoritarianism]{.underline}. The December 2014 edition of Russia's
military doctrine identified the United States and NATO as the top
threat to Russia.1 The President of Estonia, Toomas Ilves, described the
current situation in Europe: "Everything that has happened since 1989
has been predicated on the fundamental assumption that you don't change
borders by force, and that's now out the window."2 [Russian hostility
and expansionist goals have been manifest at least since Russia's 2008
military action against Georgia]{.underline}, which reportedly was
backed by an alert of Russian nuclear forces.3 More recent Russian
military actions include the annexation of Crimea, the support of
pro-Russian rebels in Eastern Ukraine with elements of the Russian army,
and unprecedented military operations in Syria. [These developments have
created the potential for escalating]{.underline} political-military
[crises]{.underline} in Europe [and]{.underline} [may be more dangerous
than were Soviet Cold War policies and behavior]{.underline}. In
particular, as is explained herein, contemporary [Russian nuclear
strategy is intended to coerce the West and enforce Moscow's
expansionist moves with nuclear first-use threats and planning that go
well beyond Soviet Cold War behavior]{.underline}. [Until these most
recent developments, the West generally has not considered Russia to be
a security threat]{.underline} and there has been very little focus on
Russia [for two decades. U.S. attention has been elsewhere and the
desire to see Russia as only a past threat has been
overwhelming]{.underline}. Presidential candidate Mitt Romney was
roundly ridiculed when he suggested in 2012 that Russia remained a
priority security threat to the West, and in the same year a former Vice
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff asserted confidently that the risk
of a nuclear confrontation with Russia "belongs to the past, not the
future."4 And, when Russia occupied Crimea in 2014, the United States
was in the process of reducing U.S. military forces in Europe. [Russia
continues to receive limited attention]{.underline}. Indeed, [many still
dismiss the potential for an escalating crisis with
Russia,]{.underline}5 [and the systematic, integrated character of
pertinent Russian policies remains largely unrecognized]{.underline}.6
[This]{.underline} monograph [does not re-create Cold War images of
Russia; it seeks instead to identify and understand emerging realities
and the various threads of contemporary Russian policy and behavior in
the unique context of Russian grand strategy]{.underline}. [Such a
comprehensive understanding of Russian policy and behavior will be
necessary if the West is to formulate an effective counterstrategy and
minimize the potential for crises and conflicts]{.underline} that
otherwise appear inevitable. Herein are hundreds of references and
statements by senior Russian officials. Perhaps the most indicative of
Russia's strategic direction is by former Russian Foreign Minister Ivan
Ivanov, "great powers ...do not dissolve in international unions--- they
create them around themselves." It has become increasingly clear that
the government of Vladimir [Putin is willing to use naked force and
coercion]{.underline} to that end. [A reappraisal of Russian grand
strategy and its elements is long overdue following two decades of
confident Western belief in benign relations with Russia, corresponding
confident claims about the dwindling value of nuclear deterrence and
"hard" power, and naïve expectations of a perpetual "peace
dividend."]{.underline} This monograph is intended to provide an initial
step in that reappraisal. I would like to express my great appreciation
to the Sarah Scaife Foundation for the generous support that made this
monograph possible. I am equally grateful to each of the contributing
authors and the Senior Reviewers who have worked diligently to help
ensure its integrity, credibility and veracity, and to Amy Joseph and

#### Revisionism is the best explanation for Russian behavior

China and Russia are pushing a reluctant West to re-examine its most
cherished assumptions about the shape of the global order.

[Three decades after the end of the Cold War, the parameters of the next
round of global state-on-state security competition are now in full
view]{.underline}. Long after history was declared to be at an end and
America's "unipolar moment" was so lyrically heralded, the world today
looks nothing like such post-Cold War projections. The rules-based
liberal global order has proved to be a chimera while the fundamentals
of economic power as the foundation of military strength have once again
been reaffirmed. Despite decades spent cajoling people to believe that
they owe a higher allegiance to institutions transcending the
nation-state, all too many remain stubbornly unconvinced. [This new era
of great power competition will likely remain with us for the rest of
our lives; rapid escalation and, ultimately, war are no longer merely a
theoretical possibility]{.underline}. This is not to say that the
changes wrought during the preceding decades were all for naught.
Although the core principles of great power competition are as true
today as they have always been, over the past three post-Cold War
decades the distribution of power has shifted significantly across the
globe, and in some regions quite dramatically. The world has become more
complex both in terms of technology and social cleavages, but also more
rudimentary: For America and the West more broadly, questions of
national power, national sovereignty, and ultimately national survival
are now more urgent than they have been since 1945.For America and the
West more broadly, questions of national power, national sovereignty,
and ultimately national survival are now more urgent than they have been
since 1945. The lesson here is not that timing is everything, but rather
that [strategic vision]{.underline}---along with the capacity to expect
the unexpected---[is what matters most when nations approach systemic
inflection points such as those we are at today]{.underline}. The United
States and Europe come to this current round of great power competition
burdened by several serious handicaps. [The confrontation between the
United States and]{.underline} its competitors China and [Russia is
increasingly global]{.underline}, posing a dilemma akin to that of a
two-front war. Even if one does not fall prey to the exaggerations of
China's wealth and technological progress commonly afflicting accounts
of that country's rise, it is nevertheless clear that [the United States
needs to]{.underline} move beyond the "status quo power"
handicap---namely, the reluctance to take risks by [pushi]{.underline}ng
[back against revisionist states, and the attendant desire to seek
accommodation]{.underline}. For almost half a century, analysts have
labored under the delusion that China can be brought into the liberal
international system through economic development, in the process
morphing into an approximation of a Western democracy. The belief that
economic access will somehow "domesticate" the Chinese communist regime
has always been lacking in empirical foundation. Indeed, the examples
invoked by many in political science, such as the political evolution of
South Korea and Taiwan, have been misapplied; in both cases the
strategic imperative of remaining close to the United States shaped
their domestic politics. The fundamental change in our view of China as
a power hostile to the United States, intent on replacing America in the
international order, should be the underlying assumption of any debate
about U.S. global strategy going forward. This means that in the near
term we must make every effort to "onshore" the critical elements of our
supply chain that we have so ill-advisedly farmed out to Asia. We need
to recall the Cold War lesson that technological superiority rests not
only in design but, more importantly, in processes, alloys, composites,
and so on---namely, in our technological culture writ large. During the
Cold War the Soviets could steal Western designs for weapons systems,
but they had to rely on their own technological culture to produce their
versions. In contrast, we have transferred the crown jewels of American
technological know-how to China, the devastating consequences of which
become clear when we compare the parameters of our systems with theirs,
and measure the shift in the balance of power. "If you are in a hole,
stop digging," goes the old American adage. This applies in spades to
our decades-long trade policy, which has allowed China to enter the WTO,
to claim "developing country" status, and to continue to extort American
corporations for their most treasured economic secrets in exchange for
market access. Enough already. Putin's Russia presents a different
challenge to U.S. global supremacy. [Russia is a **revisionist power**
intent on creating a sphere of privileged interest along its periphery,
including in Europe, but it lacks the resources to mount a frontal
challenge to the United States]{.underline}. [However]{.underline},
Vladimir [Putin has repeatedly demonstrated his thorough understanding
of full-spectrum statecraft]{.underline}, including the application of
military force to achieve clearly defined political objectives. [Putin's
ability to selectively invest his country's limited
resources]{.underline}, whether [in new military hardware or in
campaigns such as in Syria and Ukraine, has yielded outsized
results]{.underline}. The key to Russia's successful challenge to the
rules-based order in Europe has been Putin's ability to anticipate the
deeply ingrained risk aversion of key powers in Europe. Hence, despite
having kicked over the table on which the leading states in the European
Union sought to set the future of the European order, Putin still
continues to dangle before them visions of a "grand deal" that would
address Russia's "legitimate security concerns." His gamble in Ukraine,
meanwhile, has polarized the European Union, and especially has widened
the rift over differing threat perceptions between countries like
Germany and France, on the one hand, and the former Soviet satellites
and the Scandinavians on the northeastern flank on the other. The
growing discord within the European Union and NATO has yielded a debate
over what, during the Cold War, would have been considered a mortal
threat to the unity of the West, as seen in today's rather loose talk
about the need for European "strategic autonomy"---as though some of
NATO's most vital European allies were now tracking toward an
emancipatory policy that could ultimately leave the United States
outside. In short, [the challenge to the United States posed by
Russia]{.underline}, notwithstanding the country's relatively weak
economic position [when compared to China's, is much more]{.underline}
intricate and [insidious]{.underline}, for [it threatens to undermine
and dismantle the foundations of the Transatlantic security
system]{.underline}. [The United States is at an inflection
point,]{.underline} one in which [our choices going forward will have a
transformative impact on our security and that of our
allies]{.underline}. This is a "late 1940s moment"---one that requires a
massive adjustment in how we view and interact with other key players in
the international system and what priorities we set going forward. Today
Washington appears to have finally awakened to the reality that
long-cherished assumptions about what the world would look like after
the Cold War were fundamentally flawed. It is almost uncanny that this
most profound redefinition of U.S. foreign and security policy has been
produced during the Donald J. Trump presidency---at a time when American
politics have become polarized to a point few thought possible only a
decade ago. And yet, through its National Security Strategy and its
National Defense Strategy, the Trump Administration has produced
arguably the first coherent articulation since the fall of the Berlin
Wall of the world as it is rather than as we wish it to be, free of
pious shibboleths and expressing a determination to redress past
mistakes. [What needs to happen now is]{.underline} the translation of
these key strategic documents into guidance that will shape the
[restoration of our military capabilities and those of our
allies]{.underline}. This is our "late 1940s moment," a latter-day
version of the reorientation that yielded our present defense
infrastructure and ultimately led to the creation of NATO. The West
needs to pull together yet again. The clock is ticking.

#### Even if they aren't revisionist, that's only because of a lack of economic resources \-\-- plan changes that calculus

**Arshakuni 18** -- MA Candidate @ Davis Center (Nini, "Perspectives \|
Russia\'s Approach to the Global Order: Revisionist or Not?,"
<https://eurasianet.org/perspectives-russias-approach-to-the-global-order-revisionist-or-not)//BB>

Yet [Russia does not and cannot steer global rules because it does not
have the **economic resources**]{.underline}. "[It is important to go
beyond a simple and misleading dichotomy between]{.underline} dominant
and emerging or between [revisionist and status-quo powers because
Russia fits none of these categories. We need to think about Russia as a
restoring or **recovering power**]{.underline}," he said. Discussions of
the global liberal order often fail to acknowledge that the Soviet Union
also contributed to the establishment of that order after World War II,
he pointed out. The USSR helped found the United Nations and led in the
creation of other institutions and norms (today's non-proliferation
regime and international pacts on human rights, for example) fundamental
to the current international order. Russian official discourse still
emphasizes the importance of international institutions. The central
role for the UN and international law has been acknowledged in every
Foreign Policy Concept adopted in Russia since 2000. To explain Russia's
adherence to existing international institutions such as the UN, Istomin
claimed that with the rise of new powers -- such as China, India, and
even the EU, which have their own agendas regarding the shape of
international institutions -- [Russia has less ability to affect
international norms]{.underline}, especially when compared to the
position the USSR enjoyed in a bipolar world. The United States, of
course, faces a similar challenge because it also must consider the
interests of rising powers. Thus, new institutions will be less
reflective of Russian and American interests -- giving the once-dominate
superpowers a reason to cooperate. Istomin conceded that the [existing
discourse on Russia as a revisionist power is not completely out of
touch with reality]{.underline}. "There are institutions in the
international system which Russia does not feel comfortable with," he
said, citing NATO as an example. [Now that Russia has recovered from the
crises of the 1990s, it has pushed back against]{.underline} those
[institutions]{.underline} in which Russia's voice was not heard.
Another reason Russia tries to shape new rules and institutions in the
international system is strategic. "[Russia understands that the rising
powers will continue to rise, and it thus tries to accommodate the
interests of other rising powers in order to secure a better bargaining
position until they get stronger,]{.underline}" Istomin said. The BRICS
-- a forum of countries with very diverse agendas -- exemplify Moscow's
accommodation. "Russia embraced the idea proposed by the rising powers
about the reform of international financial institutions despite it not
being Russia's priority."

The Cold War didn't "end" --- it was won.

--- George H. W. Bush, 1992

As U.S.--Russian relations reach a post--Cold War low, a growing number
of observers have concluded that Western behavior, not Russian
belligerence, ultimately lies at fault. According to this analysis, the
United States and its European allies "humiliated" Russia by enlarging
NATO, undertaking military action in the Balkans, extending trade and
other forms of soft power to the former Eastern Bloc, and generally not
affording Moscow the respect it supposedly deserved as a great (albeit
territorially smaller and militarily weaker than it once was) power.
"The West will find it easier to coexist with this tormented,
intransigent, melancholy and oil-rich neighbor when Russia feels
comfortable with itself, not when its nose is rubbed in its long history
of failure," the British military historian Max Hastings wrote in 2008
after Russia invaded Georgia. Two years later, well into Barack Obama's
"reset" aimed at repairing relations with Moscow, former U.S. ambassador
to the Soviet Union Jack Matlock blamed American hubris for the rise in
tensions. "The collapse of the Soviet Union was seen as a military
victory, which led to a spirit of triumphalism and a feeling of
omnipotence as the 'sole superpower,'" he said. Repeating the word
"triumphalist," which has become ubiquitous in these types of
appraisals, Matlock complained that "a lot of this triumphalist
mythology has come from the neocons whose ideas were rejected by Reagan,
who in the end was more interested in negotiating." So stubbornly is
this historical narrative of Western arrogance and Russian innocence
asserted that it has become impervious to all manner of Russian
mischief, no matter how morally egregious or physically destructive. In
2014, after Russian president Vladimir Putin annexed the Crimean
peninsula in the first armed seizure of territory on the European
continent since World War II, former Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev
denounced NATO "triumphalism" as the culprit, though the military
alliance had expressly chosen not to offer Ukraine a pathway to
membership at its 2008 Bucharest summit. So, too, last year did Odd Arne
Westad, a Harvard professor and the author of a mammoth new history of
the Cold War, accuse America of "post--Cold War triumphalism" that
"promoted a prosperity agenda of market values on a global scale." He
lamented that, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia was
not welcomed into the Western fold. Instead, "ideas and assumptions that
had built up over generations persisted, despite the disappearance of
the Soviet threat." According to these critics of Western
"triumphalism," Washington and its allies repeatedly neglected to take
post-Soviet Russia's legitimate security concerns into account, thereby
making the present impasse all but inevitable. "After the end of the
Cold War, the Euro-Atlantic countries failed to create a regional
security system that would include Russia," Dmitri Trenin wrote in
February. Trenin, a former Soviet army colonel who now works at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, is essentially arguing that
NATO, originally established to resist Moscow, ought to have extended
membership to it. The most recent and prominent airing of this view
appeared in mid May in the pages of The New York Times Magazine, where
Russian-American author Keith Gessen profiled two camps of Washington
"Russia hands." On one side, he wrote, are the hawkish
"internationalists" who impudently act as if the West prevailed in some
long twilight struggle against Soviet Communism. On the other are sober
"realists" who "believe that the intransigent and unchanging one in the
relationship is the United States --- that the country has never gotten
past the idea that it 'won' the Cold War and therefore needs to spread,
at all costs, the American way of life." These critics of Western
"triumphalism" are right that the root of our current problems with
Russia can be traced back to the 1990s. But they have drawn the wrong
lessons from that crucial period. [No proper understanding of
contemporary U.S.--Russian relations can escape the fact that the West
won --- and the Soviet Union lost --- the Cold War]{.underline}. By
"win," one does not mean only that the free world achieved its
geopolitical objectives, liberating Eastern Europe and orchestrating the
downfall of a superpower rival. For the Cold War was more than a mere
struggle over territory and global influence. It was also a moral
struggle between two fundamentally different systems. And it wasn't just
liberal-democratic market capitalism that prevailed over totalitarian
command-economy socialism. What also won was a version of state
sovereignty whereby small nations have as much right to determine their
destiny as large ones do, free from external domination. With the fall
of the Berlin Wall, there triumphed a particular vision of ordering not
just a society but the world. Long before the collapse of their empire,
Soviet leaders endorsed this conception of state sovereignty by signing
the Helsinki Final Act of 1975, which committed signatories to respect
one another's "sovereign equality," the "inviolability of frontiers,"
the "territorial integrity of states," "non-intervention in internal
affairs," and the "peaceful settlement of disputes." Collectively, these
resolutions constituted the act's "first basket" of agreements. The
second basket incorporated trade and scientific cooperation, while the
third committed states to uphold human rights, freedom of emigration,
and freedom of the press. At the time, the Soviets were eager for such
an agreement because it essentially legitimized their post-war
domination of Central and Eastern Europe, where they had installed
Communist puppet regimes (which, along with the United States and its
Western allies, were also party to the Helsinki accords). While the
Eastern Bloc governments had no intention of actually upholding the
act's "third basket," their formal recognition of it came back to haunt
them in the form of dissidents who cited these written commitments in
making their case for great political freedom. So, too, were the Soviets
and their allies taken by surprise when national independence movements
referenced the act's sovereignty provisions to expose the fundamental
illegitimacy of the Warsaw Pact, all along a façade for Russian
colonialism. That the Soviets (and, later, Russians) never intended to
take the human-rights and sovereignty provisions of the Final Act
seriously is a repudiation not of the Final Act itself but of the
leaders who disingenuously signed it. Soviet leaders again endorsed the
principle of national sovereignty when, in 1989, they supplanted the
Brezhnev Doctrine, which permitted Warsaw Pact countries to intervene
militarily against "forces hostile to socialism" in other member
nations, with the "Sinatra Doctrine," whereby Eastern Bloc states could
do it their way. Though it was not Gorbachev's intention, this momentous
decision ultimately led to the peaceful dissolution of the Soviet Union.
The first post--Cold War conflict to erupt between Russia and the West
was in the Balkans, where the United States and its allies intervened
militarily to avert ethnic cleansing carried out by Moscow's traditional
ally, the Serbs. Confronting internal economic and political
instability, and prosecuting a scorched-earth war in Chechnya, Russia
was in no position to challenge NATO in the former Yugoslavia. This
inability to contest Western intervention in what Moscow considered its
imperial backyard bred feelings of resentment among a rising generation
of Russian nationalists, who would later choose to fixate on the Western
military alliance as the greatest threat to Russian security.
[The]{.underline} subject of NATO's post--Cold War enlargement, and more
specifically the [false claim that Western leaders promised their Soviet
counterparts that NATO would refrain from incorporating new members, has
won credibility of late]{.underline}. [Particularly after the Ukraine
crisis, Russia's Western sycophants, seeking to justify Putin's
aggression, trotted out the claim that NATO's "encircling" of Russia had
somehow forced Putin into invading his neighbors]{.underline}. **[It is
remarkable how pervasive this narrative has become]{.underline}**.
Touring the United States over the past year to promote my book about
Europe, I have never addressed an audience in which someone did not
mention, if not endorse, this argument. Assertions of Western
"triumphalism" with regard to NATO enlargement gained strength in
December when an outfit called the National Security Archive at George
Washington University selectively published a series of recently
declassified U.S.-government documents purporting to show, once and for
all, that Western leaders had indeed offered their Soviet interlocutors
a "cascade of assurances" that NATO would not expand. Despite its
official-sounding name, the National Security Archive is a left-wing
organization committed to exposing the Cold War sins, real or alleged,
of America through the highly selective publishing of tendentiously
presented documents, and nothing in the latest dump tells us anything
new. As is already known, James Baker, then the secretary of state,
promised Gorbachev that NATO would not expand "one inch eastward." The
archive attempts to embellish this statement by releasing some
extraneous once-classified documents. But Baker made that pledge solely
in the context of East Germany, a country that, like the Soviet Union,
would soon cease to exist. At the time, it was inconceivable that places
such as Poland or Czechoslovakia (another state not long for this
world), never mind the soon-to-be independent Soviet Baltic republics of
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, might one day join NATO. Russia and its
Western apologists can offer no evidence of a promise not to enlarge
NATO, because such a promise was never made. Gorbachev should have the
final word on this matter: "The topic of 'NATO expansion' was not
discussed at all, and it wasn't brought up in those years," he said in
October 2014. "I say this with full responsibility. Not a single Eastern
European country raised the issue, not even after the Warsaw Pact ceased
to exist in 1991." Only years later would the prospect of former Warsaw
Pact states' joining NATO become a subject of more than academic
discussion, when the alliance offered membership to Hungary, Poland, and
the Czech Republic. In 1997, all three joined. But relitigating what
assurances the West did or did not make to the collapsing Soviet Union
about NATO's future status is a distraction from the more fundamental
question: What right does Russia have to decide whether its former
satrapies can join a defensive military alliance of their own free will?
In the words of the former State Department official Kirk Bennet, "NATO
enlargement was driven by demand, not supply." The newly independent
countries of Central and Eastern Europe all desperately wanted to join
NATO, and given their histories with Russia, it's not hard to understand
why. The practice of invading European neighbors because they stray from
the true socialist path --- employed by the Russians in Hungary and
Czechoslovakia in 1956 and 1968, respectively --- is a model of
interstate behavior that was supposed to have been forever discredited
with the collapse of the Soviet Union. (As events in Georgia in 2008 and
Ukraine six years later demonstrate, however, it has unfortunately been
revived.) The principles of state sovereignty and territorial integrity
initially laid out in the Helsinki Final Act were later enshrined in the
1990 Charter of Paris for a New Europe, agreed to by the Soviet Union
and, following its dissolution, its legal successor state, the Russian
Federation. In 1994, Russia signed the Budapest Memorandum with Ukraine,
Great Britain, and the United States, which saw Kiev surrender its ample
nuclear-weapons stockpile to Moscow in exchange for guarantees of its
territorial integrity. As with practically every understanding it signed
in the post--Cold War period, Russia later violated this pledge.
Throughout the 1990s and well into the reign of Vladimir Putin, the
United States and its allies went out of their way to draw Russia closer
and assuage any fears its government might have had, genuine or
contrived, that the Western alliance harbored aggressive designs. In
1997, the NATO--Russia Founding Act was signed to guide relations
between the West and Russia; among other provisions, the accord limits
the number of troops each side may permanently station in Central and
Eastern Europe. Five years later, the NATO--Russia Council was
established to serve as a forum for "consultation, consensus-building,
cooperation, joint decision and joint action, in which the individual
NATO member states and Russia work as equal partners on a wide spectrum
of security issues of common interest." During the early years of the
war in Afghanistan, Russia and NATO collaborated constructively, with
the former permitting the latter use of its airspace and territory to
transfer supplies to the theater. As late as 2010, the problem that
Russia's then-ambassador to NATO had with the military alliance was not
that it was too belligerent but that it emanated a "mood of
capitulation" with respect to Afghanistan. Further signs of Western
cooperation included granting Russia a place at the table of the G-7
(which thereby became the G-8, until Moscow's annexation of Crimea led
to the suspension of its membership) and admission into the World Trade
Organization. [What provoked the deterioration in relations between
Russia and the West, then, was neither NATO enlargement, nor American
foreign policy, nor anything else that the West did, but **Russian
revanchism and revisionism**]{.underline}. [In 2007, Putin delivered an
anti-American tirade]{.underline} at the Munich Security Conference,
shocking attendees. [Shortly thereafter, Russia launched a cyberattack
on tiny Estonia, and the following year it invaded Georgia]{.underline}.
The French writer Michel Gurfunkiel identifies Putin's four major
strategic goals as reuniting "all the Russian-speaking peoples under a
single nation-state," reestablishing Russia as "the first among equals"
in the "Eurasian community," weakening Europe and the transatlantic
alliance, and restoring Russia as a global power. All of these
objectives are in direct conflict with the understandings achieved by
Western victory in the Cold War and agreed to by Putin's predecessors in
the Kremlin, foremost among them that the consensual model of interstate
relations had replaced the coercive methods of the past. [Putin's
rhetorical embrace of "Eurasianism," an ideology with fascistic and
mystical undertones, and his establishment of the "Eurasian Union" as a
direct competitor to the European Union, signaled the decisive shift
away from cooperation with the West to a strategy of weakening it from
within]{.underline}. [Unlike post-war Germany, which made full amends
for its past militarism and atrocities and committed itself to
multilateralism and nonviolent approaches to resolving international
conflict, Russia never went through a process]{.underline} of
Vergangenheitsbewältigung, or "[coming to terms]{.underline} with the
past." Perhaps this was an unavoidable consequence of the Cold War's
peaceful end --- the Soviet Union, unlike the Third Reich, was not
subjected to a traumatic military defeat and occupation by its
adversaries. But [the consequences of Russia's not engaging in the sort
of critical appraisal of its own history so admirably pursued by
post-Holocaust Germany are visible all around us]{.underline} in the
modern-day cult of Josef Stalin, the veil of silence surrounding
Communist-era crimes, and the popular support among the Russian people
for Putin's military adventures abroad. Following the advice of the
"realists" Gessen so admires and allowing Moscow a veto over the
foreign-policy orientation of former subjects would have indulged
Russia's notion that it is still an empire and invited more aggression.
By this light, NATO's denial of Membership Action Plans for Ukraine and
Georgia indicates how the West failed to reap the benefits of winning
the Cold War. Chief among these benefits ought to have been the welcome
rise of sovereign countries' Western aspirations. Instead, the West
preferred to assuage Russian inferiority complexes and hurt feelings.
Deprived of the argument that it was nonexistent NATO expansion to
Ukraine that "provoked" Russia to invade it, some realists cite the EU's
2013 offer of a trade-and-aid package to Kiev as having justified the
aggression. What this excuse neglects to acknowledge is Putin's 2004
statement "If Ukraine wants to join the EU and is welcome there, we can
only welcome that." Ten years later, he waged war against the country
for trying to do precisely what he had encouraged. 2 [Our present-day
problems with Russia stem from two utterly different, and fundamentally
irreconcilable, understandings of what the end of the Cold War
meant.]{.underline} It wasn't just a side that lost but a whole
understanding of how the world should work. From the assassination of
Archduke Ferdinand to the Sudeten crisis to the division of Germany,
most of the 20th century's major conflicts erupted over border disputes
in Central and Eastern Europe. Vladimir Putin's refusal to acknowledge
that small countries have the same rights as larger ones has pitted a
rules-abiding West against a rules-flouting Russia. Faced with neighbors
wishing to break free of their post-imperial yoke, Russians have not
paused to consider that maybe it's their behavior, past and present,
that has led the former "captive nations" to be wary of Moscow's
designs. Rather, [Russians have internalized, in the words of former
U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Steven Pifer, the attitude that "nobody likes
us, what's wrong with everybody?" For Western policymakers to endorse
such myopia is like **giving car keys to a drunk**]{.underline}. As
Russian troops marched into Crimea under the same pretext as German
forces did into the Sudetenland --- claiming to "protect" the rights and
lives of allegedly threatened ethnic comrades --- German chancellor
Angela Merkel was said to have remarked that [Putin lives in "another
world."]{.underline} He does. [It's a dangerous world where might makes
right]{.underline}, one that successive generations of Western
statesmen, along with courageous Poles, Czechs, Romanians, and countless
others, fought to overcome. [The post--Cold War "ideas and assumptions"
of America]{.underline} and its allies [were not
"triumphalist]{.underline}" diktats [meant to humiliate or "encircle"
Russia]{.underline} by "rubbing its nose" in defeat, but fundamental
principles of sovereignty and national self-determination established to
avert war on a continent repeatedly plagued by it. [Far from being too
"triumphalist" in its dealings with Russia, if anything, the West was
**not triumphalist enough**]{.underline}.

### AT no war

#### Once a [minor conflict]{.underline} starts, it escalates \-\-- neither side has de-escalation measures in place, and both leaders are conflict-prone

**Wood 17** - senior military correspondent for The Huffington Post. His
second book, What Have We Done: the Moral Injury of Our Longest Wars,
based on his Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting on veterans of Iraq and
Afghanistan, was published by Little, Brown in November 2016. (David,
"THIS IS HOW THE NEXT WORLD WAR STARTS,"
<https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/trump-russia-putin-military-crisis/)//BB>

[Putin's favored tactic]{.underline}, intelligence officials say,
[is]{.underline} known as "[escalation dominance]{.underline}." [The
idea is to]{.underline} push the other side until you win, a senior
officer based in Europe explained---to "[escalate to the point where the
adversary stops]{.underline}, won't go farther. [It's a very
destabilizing strategy]{.underline}." Stavridis cast it in the terms of
an old Russian proverb: "Probe with a bayonet; when you hit steel
withdraw, when you hit mush, proceed." Right now, he added, "the
Russians keep pushing out and hitting mush." This mindset is basically
the opposite of how both American and Soviet leaders approached each
other during the Cold War, even during periods of exceptional stress
such as the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. Having endured the devastation of
World War II, they understood the horror that lurked on the far side of
a crisis. "When things started to get too close, they would back off,"
said Miller, the retired Pentagon official. The term of art for this
constant recalibration of risk is "crisis management"---the "most
demanding form of diplomacy," writes Sir Lawrence Freedman, an emeritus
professor of war studies at King's College London. Leaders had to make
delicate judgments about when to push their opponent and when to create
face-saving off-ramps. Perhaps most critically, they had to possess the
confidence to de-escalate when necessary. Skilled crisis management,
Freedman writes, requires "an ability to match deeds with words, to
convey threats without appearing reckless, and to offer concessions
without appearing soft, often while under intense media scrutiny and
facing severe time pressures." A recent textbook example came in January
2016, when Iran seized those 10 U.S. Navy sailors, claiming that they
had been spying in Iranian waters in the eastern Persian Gulf. President
Barack Obama's secretary of state, John Kerry, immediately opened
communications with his counterpart in Tehran, using channels
established for negotiating the nuclear deal with Iran. By the next
morning, the sailors had been released. The U.S. acknowledged the
sailors had strayed into Iranian waters but did not apologize, asserting
that the transgression had been an innocent error. Iran, meanwhile,
acknowledged that the sailors had not been spying. (The peaceful
resolution was not applauded by Breitbart News, headed at the time by
Stephen Bannon, who is now Trump's chief White House strategist. Obama,
a Breitbart writer sneered, has been "castrated on the world stage by
Iran.") [Neither Putin nor Trump, it's safe to say, are crisis managers
by nature. Both are notoriously thin-skinned, operate on instinct, and
have a tendency to shun expert advice]{.underline}. (These days, [Putin
is said to surround himself not with seasoned diplomats but cronies from
his old spy days]{.underline}.) [Both are unafraid of brazenly lying,
fueling an atmosphere of extreme distrust on both sides]{.underline}.
[Stavridis, who has studied both Putin and Trump]{.underline} and who
met with Trump in December, [concluded that the two leaders "are not
risk-averse. They are risk-affectionate]{.underline}." Aron, the Russia
expert, said, "I think [there is a]{.underline} much more [cavalier
attitude by Putin toward war in general and the threat of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. He continued, "He is not a madman, but [he is much
more inclined to use the threat of nuclear weapons in]{.underline}
conventional \[[military]{.underline}\] [and political confrontation
with the West]{.underline}." Perhaps the most significant difference
between the two is that Putin is far more calculating than Trump. In
direct negotiations, he is said to rely on videotaped analysis of the
facial expressions of foreign leaders that signal when the person is
bluffing, confused or lying. [At times, Trump has been surprisingly
quick to lash out at a perceived slight from Putin]{.underline},
although these moments have been overshadowed by his effusive praise for
the Russian leader. On December 22, Putin promised to strengthen
Russia's strategic nuclear forces in his traditional year-end speech to
his officer corps. Hours later, Trump vowed, via Twitter, to "greatly
strengthen and expand" the U.S. nuclear weapons arsenal. On Morning Joe
the following day, host Mika Brzezinski said that Trump had told her on
a phone call, "Let it be an arms race. We will outmatch them at every
pass and outlast them all." And in late March, the Wall Street Journal
reported that Trump was becoming increasingly frustrated with Russia,
throwing up his hands in exasperation when informed that Russia may have
violated an arms treaty. [Some]{.underline} in national security circles
see Trump's impulsiveness as a cause for concern but not for panic. "He
can always overreact," [said]{.underline} Anthony Cordesman, senior
strategic analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies
and a veteran of many national security posts throughout the U.S.
government. "\[But\] [there are a lot of people \[around the president\]
to prevent an overreaction]{.underline} with serious consequences."
Let's say that Trump acted upon his impulse to tell a fighter pilot to
shoot a jet that barrel-rolled an American plane. Such a response would
still have to be carried out by the Pentagon, Cordesman said---a process
with lots of room for senior officers to say, "Look, boss, this is a
great idea but can we talk about the repercussions?" And **[yet that
process is no longer as robust as it once was]{.underline}**. [Many
senior policymaking positions at the Pentagon and State Department
remain unfilled]{.underline}. A small cabal in the White House,
including Bannon, Jared Kushner and a few others, has asserted a role in
foreign policy decisions outside the normal NSC process. It's not yet
clear how much influence is wielded by Trump's widely respected national
security adviser, Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster. [When lines of
authority and influence are so murky, it increases the risk that a minor
incident could boil up into an unintended clash]{.underline}, said
retired Marine Corps General John Allen, who has served in senior
military and diplomatic posts. [To complicate matters further, the
relentless pace of information in the social media age has destroyed the
one precious factor that helped former leaders safely navigate perilous
situations: time]{.underline}. It's hard to believe now, but during the
1962 Cuban missile crisis, for instance, President Kennedy and his
advisers deliberated for a full 10 weeks before announcing a naval
quarantine of the island. In 1969, a U.S. spy plane was shot down by
North Korean jets over the Sea of Japan, killing all 31 Americans on
board. It took 26 hours for the Pentagon and State Department to
recommend courses of action to President Richard Nixon, according to a
declassified secret assessment. (Nixon eventually decided not to
respond.) Today, thanks to real-time video and data streaming, the men
in the Kremlin and White House can know---or think they know---as much
as the guy in the cockpit of a plane or on the bridge of a warship. The
president no longer needs to rely on reports from military leaders that
have been filtered through their expertise and deeper knowledge of the
situation on the ground. Instead, he can watch a crisis unfold on a
screen and react in real time. [Once news of an incident hits the
internet, the pressure to respond becomes even harder to
withstand]{.underline}. "[The ability to recover from early missteps is
greatly reduced,]{.underline}" Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has written. "[The speed of war
has changed, and the nature of these changes makes the global security
environment even more unpredictable, dangerous, and
unforgiving]{.underline}." And so in the end, [no matter how cool and
unflappable the instincts of military men and women]{.underline} like
Kevin Webster, [what will smother the inevitable spark is steady,
thoughtful leadership from within the White House and the
Kremlin]{.underline}. [A recognition that first reports may be wrong; a
willingness to absorb new and perhaps unwelcome information; a thick
skin to ward off insults and accusations]{.underline}; an acknowledgment
of the limited value of threats and bluffs; and [a willingness to
recognize the core interests of the other side]{.underline} and a
willingness to accept a face-saving solution. **[These qualities are not
notably on display in either capital]{.underline}**.

#### No checks on conflict escalation, and Trump is prone to overreact

**Wood 17** - senior military correspondent for The Huffington Post. His
second book, What Have We Done: the Moral Injury of Our Longest Wars,
based on his Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting on veterans of Iraq and

"THIS IS HOW THE NEXT WORLD WAR STARTS,"
<https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/trump-russia-putin-military-crisis/)//BB>

With these issues in mind, I traveled to Germany this winter to talk
with U.S. Air Force General Tod D. Wolters, who commands American and
NATO air operations. We sat in his headquarters at Ramstein Air Base, a
gleaming, modern complex where officers in the uniforms of various NATO
nations bustle efficiently through polished corridors. "[The degree of
hair-triggeredness is a concern]{.underline}," said Wolters, a former
fighter pilot who encountered Soviet bloc pilots during the Cold War.
"The possibility of an intercept gone wrong," he added, is "on my mind
24/7/365." Admiral James G. Stavridis, the commander of NATO from 2009
to 2013 and now Dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University, is more
blunt. [The potential for miscalculation "is]{.underline} probably
[higher than at any other point since the end of the Cold
War,"]{.underline} he told me. "**[We are now at maximum
danger]{.underline}**." [This may sound counter-intuitive,
given]{.underline} President Donald [Trump's extravagant professions of
admiration for Putin]{.underline}. [But]{.underline} the strong
consensus inside the U.S. military establishment is that [the pattern of
Russian provocation will continue]{.underline}---and not just because
the various investigations into the Trump campaign's links with Russia
make détente politically unlikely. [Antagonizing the West is central to
one of Putin's most cherished ambitions]{.underline}: undermining NATO.
By constantly pushing the limits with risky intercepts and other
tactics, Putin forces NATO to make difficult choices about when and how
to respond that can sow dissension among its members. In addition, a
certain belligerence towards the U.S. is practically a political
necessity for Putin. The Russian leader owes his popularity to "the
tiger of patriotic mobilization," said Leon Aron, the director of
Russian studies at the American Enterprise Institute. Given the
country's diminished status in the world and its stalled economy, he
added, militarized fervor for the motherland "is the only thing going
for his regime." Meanwhile,\[2\] 2. According to an analysis by the U.S.
Army War College, "[the top leadership is moving the country onto a war
footing]{.underline}" in response to what it sees as "an arc of crisis
around Russia and a period of great turbulence in international
affairs." since the departure of Trump's first national security
adviser, Michael Flynn, his foreign policy team is now dominated by
officials who advocate a hard line on Russia.\[3\] 3. These include
ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, national security adviser
H.R. McMaster, and senior National Security Council Russia adviser Fiona
Hill. Secretary of Defense James Mattis predicted at his confirmation
hearing that "there are an increasing number of areas where we are going
to have to confront Russia." For all these reasons, Philip [Breedlove,
who retired last summer after three years as supreme allied commander of
NATO, isn't optimistic that Russia will back off]{.underline} anytime
soon. "We're in a bad place and it's getting worse rather than better,"
he told me. "[The probability of coming up against that unintended but
strategic mess-up is, I think, rising rather than becoming less
likely.]{.underline}" When Breedlove's successor, General Curtis
Scaparrotti, took command in May 2016, he grimly warned a gathering of
diplomats and officers of a "resurgent Russia" and cautioned that NATO
must be ready "to fight tonight if deterrence fails." [All of this is
happening at a time when most of the old Cold War safeguards for
resolving tensions with Russia---treaties, gentlemen's understandings,
unofficial back channels---have fallen away]{.underline}. When a Russian
jet barrel-rolls a U.S. aircraft, a senior U.S. official hops in a car
and is driven to the white marble monolith on Wisconsin Avenue that
houses the Russian embassy. There, he sits down with Sergey Kislyak, the
ambassador who has recently attained minor fame for his surreptitious
meetings with various Trump associates. A typical conversation, the U.S.
official told me, goes something like this: "I say, 'Look here, Sergey,
we had this incident on April 11, this is getting out of hand, this is
dangerous.'" Kislyak, the official said, benignly denies that any
misbehavior has occurred. (When I made my own trip to the embassy late
last year, a senior official assured me with a polite smile that Russian
pilots do nothing dangerous---and certainly not barrel-rolls.) [Among
the many senior officers I spoke to in Washington and Europe who are
worried about Russia, there was one more factor fueling their anxiety:
their new commander-in-chief, and how he might react in a
crisis]{.underline}. [After a Russian fighter barrel-rolled an RC-135
over the Baltic Sea last April, Trump fumed that the Obama
administration had only lodged a diplomatic protest]{.underline}. [He
considered this to be a weak response.]{.underline} "It just shows how
low we've gone, where they can toy with us like that," he complained on
a radio talk show. "It shows a lack of respect." [If he were president,
Trump went on, he would do things differently]{.underline}. "You wanna
at least make a phone call or two," he conceded. "\[But\] [at a certain
point]{.underline}, when that sucker comes by you, you gotta shoot. [You
gotta shoot]{.underline}. I mean, you gotta shoot."

### AT war stays conventional

#### Russia will [over-rely]{.underline} on nuclear threats in response to conventional crises \-\-- risks nuclear war

The year 2014 was a major turning point in post-Cold War history when
Russia invaded and annexed Crimea and engaged in an expanded war in
Eastern Ukraine with the objective of extending Russian control and
possibly creating a land bridge to Crimea. As noted previously,
President Toomas Ilves of Estonia has pointed out, "Everything that has
happened since 1989 has been predicated on the fundamental assumption
that you don't change borders by force, and that's now out the
window."62 It was also a turning point in the Russian use of nuclear
threats. In 2014 and 2015, Russia injected nuclear weapons into the
Ukraine crisis, threatening a nuclear response in the event of a NATO
counter attack. As Deputy Secretary of Defense Work has observed, "
...senior Russian officials continue to make irresponsible statements
regarding Russia's nuclear forces, and we assess that they are doing it
to intimidate our allies and us."63 In his August 2014 Yalta speech on
Ukraine, Putin referenced Russia's large and growing nuclear
capabilities, and warned that NATO should not "mess" with Russia.64 In
September 2014, then-Ukrainian Defense Minister Colonel General Valeriy
Heletey said that Russia threatened on several occasions across
unofficial channels to use tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine.65
In a March 2015 "documentary" marking the one year anniversary of the
Russian annexation of Crimea, Putin said he was willing to put Russian
nuclear forces on alert during the invasion.66 As Colonel (ret.)
Vladimir Yevseyev, Director of the Center for Social and Political
Research wrote, "Putin is saying that under certain conditions, Russia
will be ready to use nuclear weapons to defend Crimea."67
[Putin]{.underline} reportedly [has made nuclear threats]{.underline}
through unofficial channels [over Crimea and the Baltic
republics.]{.underline} According to the London Times, Russian generals
present at a meeting in Germany who said they were speaking for the
Russian government indicated that "any military move by the West on
Crimea would trigger a Russian response, possibly involving nuclear
force. 'The United States should also understand it would also be at
risk,"' the generals reportedly said, and the paper noted that
"President Putin is using the threat of a nuclear showdown over the
Baltic states to force NATO to back away from Russia's border."68 [The
fundamental difference in these statements and past Russian nuclear
threats is that Russia is now talking about the first use of nuclear
weapons **in support of Russian aggression and expansion**, not only in
response]{.underline} to an attack on Russia. **[This is an important
shift]{.underline}**. As Lieutenant General Sir Adrian Bradshaw, Deputy
NATO military commander, has noted, Eastern European NATO states face
the risk of a Russian conventional attack backed by the threat of
nuclear "escalation" which would be used to prevent "reestablishment of
territorial integrity."69 [Such overt manifestations of hostility
support the foreign policy goals of restoring Russia's]{.underline}
position as a military force to be reckoned with, expanding Russian
[dominance]{.underline} in Europe, and creating opportunities for
dissension within the NATO alliance. Nuclear bomber patrols In 2007,
Putin announced the start of bomber "patrols," stating, "Combat alert
has begun today. Twenty strategic missile carriers are taking part in
it. The planes that have scrambled will be in the air for 20 hours with
refueling and in interaction with the Navy."70 These patrols continue to
this day and Russian nuclearcapable bombers are deliberately being flown
into the air defense identification zones of the U.S., Canada, NATO
Europe, and Japan. The intent of these flights is clearly to
intimidate.71 In July 2015, Sputnik News, a Russian state-run news
agency, stated the Tu-95 heavy bomber "is capable of striking the United
States with nuclear bombs," and the purpose of the flights was to
"survey the skies around Russian borders reminding everyone that Russia
is a power to be reckoned with."72 In May 2015, NATO Secretary General
Stoltenberg declared, "Russia has also significantly increased the
scale, number and range of provocative flights by nuclear-capable
bombers across much of the globe. From Japan to Gibraltar. From Crete to
California. And from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea."73 He revealed
that NATO had to intercept Russian military aircraft 400 times in 2014,
twice the number that took place in 2013.74 Sweden has reported
"'unprecedented' Cold War-era levels of activity by Russian military
bombers and fighter aircraft over the Baltic Sea area."75 UK Defense
Minister Michael Fallon said Russia was playing a "provocative and
dangerous" game that could result in the destruction of an airliner over
the UK.76 Russia has even said it will send nuclear-capable bombers to
patrol the Gulf of Mexico.77 These flights have become a serious threat
to air navigation safety because the aircraft reportedly fly without
notification or transponders functioning.78 In April 2015, there was a
particularly serious bomber incident. The UK press reported that two
Russian Tu-95 bombers flying over the English Channel were carrying at
least one "nuclear warheadcarrying missile, designed to seek and destroy
a Vanguard \[strategic ballistic missile\] submarine."79 The UK
protested this flight, reportedly over the threat it posed to air
navigation.80 On July 4, 2015, two Russian Tu-95 bombers reportedly flew
within 40 miles of the U.S. and taunted the U.S. pilots saying, "Good
morning American pilots, we are here to greet you on your Fourth of July
Independence Day."81 Since 2013, there has been a significant increase
in threatening flights by nuclear-capable bombers against Japan,
including a reported over-flight of a Japanese island.82 In 2015,
Reuters reported that the Japanese Air Force announced that "Russian
bombers and patrol planes often enter Japan's air space close to Japan's
northern Hokkaido island and close to four smaller islands which are
claimed both by Japan and Russia," and that Japanese fighter scrambles
against Russia and Chinese aircraft had returned to peak Cold War
levels.83 These flights are indicative of an increasingly hostile and
provocative posture toward both the West and Japan, intended to
strengthen Russia's political and military standing in support of
Moscow's national objectives. Russian nuclear exercises While [Russian
nuclear exercises]{.underline} are discussed in more detail in the next
chapter, their increasing [frequency and aggressiveness is a reflection
of growing hostility toward the West]{.underline}. [They]{.underline}
also [demonstrate Russian views concerning the linkage of nuclear
weapons to Russia's expansionism and war planning]{.underline}. Russian
exercises, which mainly focus on fighting the U.S., NATO and Japan,
appear to emphasize nuclear warfighting, starting with Russian first use
of a small number of nuclear weapons and escalating to general nuclear
war.84 The Russians routinely stage major strategic nuclear exercises
and theater war exercises simulating the use of nuclear weapons.85 In
addition to the normal training role these exercises serve, they likely
are intended to influence the actions of NATO states through the
intimidating effect they create. The unusual high-profile publicity
given to nuclear exercises in Russia appears designed to reinforce this
effort at intimidation. According to NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg,
"Russia's recent use of nuclear rhetoric, exercises and operations are
deeply troubling."86 Moreover, he noted that Russia has avoided
reporting on these exercises as required by the Vienna Document, agreed
to by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and
intended to enable confidence-building measures that reduce the risk of
hazardous incidents that can lead to inadvertent conflict. 87 In the
same year that the draft Russian nuclear doctrine was made public,
Russia conducted the Zapad \[West\]-1999 theater war exercise, in which
then-Russian Defense Minister Marshal Igor Sergeyev said Russia
simulated the first use of nuclear weapons: "Our Army was forced to
launch nuclear strikes first which enabled it to achieve a breakthrough
in the theater situation."88 Alexander Golts wrote that "the enemy
looked just exactly like NATO did in Yugoslavia."89 Russian press
accounts stated that Russia responded with limited nuclear strikes using
cruise missiles launched from Tu-95 and Tu-160 bombers "against
countries from whose territories the offensive was launched."90 The use
of strategic bombers with nuclear cruise missiles was repeated in later
Zapad exercises.91 In 2009, the London Daily Telegraph reported, "The
\[Russian\] armed forces are said to have carried out 'war games' in
which nuclear missiles were fired and troops practiced an amphibious
landing on the country's \[Poland's\] coast."92 In this case, the weapon
reportedly used was a tactical nuclear weapon.93 A senior NATO official
told Reuters that Russia's Zapad exercise in 2013 was "supposed to be a
counter-terrorism exercise but it involved the (simulated) use of
nuclear weapons."94 The Russians have also reportedly simulated first
use of nuclear weapons in the Vostok \[East\] exercises and in exercises
conducted in the Indian Ocean.95 Russian strategic nuclear exercises
have become larger and, since 2012, have been presided over personally
by President Putin. In 2013, while Putin hosted a meeting of the G-20
Presidents and Prime Ministers at St. Petersburg, Russia announced it
was conducting a large ICBM force exercise--the timing of which was
hardly coincidental.96 The simulated first use of nuclear weapons is
consistent with Russian concepts of conflict "deescalation," which was
part of the theoretical basis of Putin's nuclear first-use doctrine.97
Writing in May 1999, Major-General V.I. Levshin, Colonel A.V. Nedelin,
and Colonel M. Ye Sergeyev described the concept of "de-escalation of
military operations" as follows: "Fulfilling the de-escalation concept
is understood to mean actually using nuclear weapons both for showing
resolve as well as for the immediate delivery of nuclear strikes against
the enemy ....It seems to us that the cessation of military operations
will be the most acceptable thing for the enemy in this case."98 The
2014--2015 European security crisis triggered by the Russian invasion of
the Ukraine has resulted in a dramatic increase in both nuclear and
conventional Russian military exercises. Russian exercises and what
Russia calls "snap drills" reportedly will reach astounding levels in
2015 (an announcement of 4,000 planned in 2015, including 120 involving
the ICBM force).99 The senior U.S. Army general in Europe, Lt. General
Ben Hodges, says Russia has demonstrated the capability to deploy 30,000
troops and 1,000 tanks "really fast."100 Early in the Ukraine crisis, in
March 2014, the Russian Strategic Missile Troops conducted a nuclear
exercise which reportedly involved a "massive" nuclear strike.101 In May
2014, Russia announced a very large strategic nuclear exercise involving
live launches of tactical and strategic nuclear missiles and missile and
bomber defense interceptors. Russia again said the exercise---in which a
number of Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) Presidents
participated---ended in a "massive" nuclear strike.102 In February 2015,
Russia conducted what was characterized as the largest ICBM exercise
ever,103 involving 30 ICBM regiments operating in six regions of
Russia.104 In March 2015, Russia conducted "snap drills" involving
strategic nuclear missile submarines, strategic bombers, and the forward
deployment of nuclear-capable Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad. Noted
Russian journalist, Pavel Felgenhauer, wrote that the exercise was
intended to send "a clear message: Moscow is not ready to stand down and
is threatening the use of force, including nuclear weapons."105 Russia's
theater exercises with simulated nuclear weapons use have also
threatened Japan. The Russian Vostok \[East\]-2010 exercise reportedly
simulated the use of tactical nuclear weapons and, in part, was fought
in the Kuril Islands claimed by Japan.106 Despite Japan's protest, the
Vostok-2014 exercise, also reportedly involved fighting in the Kuril
Islands and was a nuclear exercise.107 Russia did not even try to hide
the fact that the exercise was directed against the U.S. and Japan.108
Russian sources called it the largest exercise in Russian history.109
These types of exercises go beyond simple defensive military training.
The extent of the simulated use of nuclear weapons is unprecedented and
the geographical reach of these exercises is clearly designed to send a
strong message to the West and Japan. Forward deployment of
nuclear-capable systems Russian officials have frequently made threats
to forward deploy nuclear-capable Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad (a
Russian enclave on the border with Poland). For example, President
Dmitry Medvedev threatened to do so the day after Barack Obama was
elected U.S. President.110 Russia appears to believe that the forward
deployment of nuclear systems makes the threat more credible and, thus,
enhances Russian political and military leverage with the states that
are threatened. The likely goal is to convince these states that
defending themselves against a Russia willing to employ nuclear weapons
to attain its foreign policy objectives is a losing proposition and that
accommodation with Russia is the better part of valor. In fact, Russia
reportedly already has deployed nuclear-capable delivery vehicles to
Crimea, including Backfire bombers and Iskander missiles.111 Russia's
most modern nuclear-capable fighter bomber, the Su-34, also appears to
have been deployed near Crimea.112 And, it is possible that Russian
nuclear weapons have also already been deployed there---the Secretary of
Ukraine's National Security Council has stated that Russia is in the
process of doing so.113 Earlier this year, Russia's nuclear weapons
handling organization, the 12th Main Directorate of the General Staff,
announced that Russia is deploying a nuclear weapons handling unit to
Crimea.114 Additionally, according to Russian press accounts, Russia is
deploying advanced nuclear-armed equipment to Kamchatka, the area of the
Russian mainland nearest Japan, including the new Borei class nuclear
ballistic missile submarine and the S-400 advanced air defense
weapon.115 The Russian military buildup The growing militarization of
Russia is a manifestation of its growing hostility toward the West.
Russian expatriate Alexei Bayer notes that Russia today is "bursting
with negative energy, hatred of the outside world and enthusiasm for
confrontation."116 Confrontation requires military capability, and
Moscow is channeling a significant amount of resources and energy toward
investing in and building up this capability, with military expenditures
now reported to be nine percent of Russian GNP.117 According to former
Duma member, Vladimir Ryzhkov, the Russian media "promotes the idea that
Russia exists in a hostile environment, that it is locked in a
confrontation with the United States and the West---because of which the
country must remain on the constant war footing of a 'besieged
fortress,' arm itself against foreign aggressors and crack down on
domestic enemies ranging from the intelligentsia to ordinary
discontents."118 Russian modernization and expansion of its conventional
and nuclear capabilities (described in Chapter Four) enhance Russia's
ability to implement its provocative threats, particularly in light of
the defense spending reductions that have been underway in the United
States and virtually every NATO state.119 This situation is more ominous
in light of the asymmetry in approaches to nuclear weapons and the
West's lack of emphasis on nuclear deterrence. In 2005, then-Chief of
the Russian General Staff General Baluyevski stated, "at present and in
the foreseeable future the threat to Russia's security from abroad is
fairly small," and hence, he added, Russia would not "increase the
number of our deployed missiles and the weapons they carry" because
"this would have taken us nowhere ..."120 That policy was reversed by
2011. Russia is now expanding its strategic nuclear forces both
quantitatively and qualitatively.121 This force buildup appears intended
to support Russian expansionism via nuclear coercion, not the West's
Cold War concept of stable mutual deterrence.122 Arms control policies,
which are discussed in Chapter Five, have contributed to the feasibility
and the intimidation potential of the Russian nuclear buildup. The New
START Treaty has made it economically possible for the Russians to match
and then exceed U.S. strategic nuclear capabilities in numeric terms. As
former Vice Chairman of the Duma Defense Committee, Aleksei Arbatov has
observed, "It is essentially a treaty on limiting the American strategic
forces ....If we want our strategic nuclear forces---as the basis of the
country's defense capability and of its status in the world---to have
equality with the United States and if parity is important to us, then
the new START Treaty makes it much easier for us to maintain it."123 As
is detailed in Chapter Five, Russia has used arms control and arms
control noncompliance to help obtain nuclear capabilities that underpin
Russian coercive nuclear threats. As the U.S National Intelligence
Council observed in a December 2012 report, not only is Russia expanding
and modernizing its strategic and tactical nuclear forces, but Russia is
"pursuing new concepts and capabilities for expanding the role of
nuclear weapons in its security strategy," while the U.S. is going in
the opposite direction.124 Among these concepts reportedly are precision
low-yield nuclear weapons and special low collateral damage weapons.125
These are the types of weapons that Russia reportedly will have a
monopoly, or near-monopoly on, and which are well suited to Russia's
strategy of nuclear intimidation.126 A now-declassified CIA report in
2000 links Russian nuclear doctrine to its new nuclear weapons:
"Moscow's military doctrine on the use of nuclear weapons has been
evolving and probably has served as the justification for the
development of very low-yield, high-precision nuclear weapons."127 It
also noted that the potential use of subkiloton nuclear weapons by
Russia "could include artillery, air-toair missiles, ABM weapons,
satellite weapons, or multiple rocket launchers against tanks or massed
troops."128 In 1998, Russian journalists Vladimir Kucherenko and Aleksey
Podymov reported the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry was working to
"create highly accurate 'clean' third-generation nuclear weapons
...which can be very compact by containing the equivalent of several
dozen or hundreds of metric tons of TNT."129 There are now reports by
well-known Russian journalists concerning Russian deployment of such
weapons on its [new strategic nuclear missiles]{.underline}.130 In April
2009, Vice Admiral Oleg Burtsev, Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff,
stated, "There is no longer any need to equip missiles with powerful
nuclear warheads ....We can install low-yield warheads on existing
cruise missiles."131 And in 2014, Russian Defense Minister General of
the Army Sergei Shoigu said, "Given the role and significance of
long-range precision weapons in strategic deterrence, the number of
precision-weapon delivery vehicles is expected to increase fourfold
before 2021."132 These weapons appear to [buttress Russian nuclear
threats]{.underline}, including nuclear first-use threats, and Russian
efforts to coerce its neighbors into accepting a renewed
Russian-dominated sphere of influence.133 Russia appears to believe it
can exploit the West's fear of war, particularly nuclear war, to force
Eastern Europeans to accept Russian dominance and
"Russification"134---with Western Europe's coerced acceptance.
Correspondingly, the abrogation of arms control agreements and the
development and deployment of new weapons, both nuclear and
conventional, appear intended to intimidate.135 Russia, for example, has
recently given considerable publicity to the claimed capabilities of its
new Armata tank and new infantry combat vehicles which were recently
shown in the Moscow Victory Day parade.136 Large displays of modern
Russian military equipment are made in the annual Victory Day military
parades, 137 and there is constant reporting in the Russian state-run
media on new and supposedly unmatched Russian weapons capabilities,
including a new long-range, underwater drone weapon armed with a
largeyield nuclear warhead.138 The July 2015 Russian disclosure that
"more than eighty warships and support vessels of various classes" were
on duty at sea is another example of this type of signaling.139
Conclusion [Moscow's confrontational approach toward the
West]{.underline}, including Japan, [is a manifestation of Russia's
overall grand strategy]{.underline} as outlined in Chapter One and its
expressed threat perceptions. [The aim]{.underline} of this policy [is
to recover the great power status of the Soviet Union by creating a
Russian sphere of domination over former Soviet territory]{.underline}.
Mounting Russian hostility toward the West is reflected in increasing
Russian suppression of democracy, the Russian nuclear and conventional
military buildup, its constant military threats, its nuclear threats and
exercises, its military aggression in Ukraine, and its intensifying
pressure on smaller states and neutrals. Russia seeks to exploit the
Western fear of war, particularly nuclear war, by a variety of nuclear
threats, doctrinal statements about the first use of nuclear weapons,
predictions of war, including nuclear war, well-publicized military
exercises involving first use of nuclear weapons against the United
States and its allies, threatened and actual forward deployment of
nuclear systems, threats to deploy new types of super weapons, threats
to abrogate arms control agreements, and actual Russian violations of
existing agreements. The upgrading of Russian military power and the
advertisement of its capabilities by publicity, military exercises,
provocative aircraft flights, and military threats are a key part of
this strategy. [In light of current Russian economic and conventional
military weakness, nuclear weapons and nuclear threats play a central
role in this Russian strategy of intimidation]{.underline}. **[The
potential for miscalculation, crises, and conflict are fully
apparent]{.underline}** [in this combination of Russian goals and
strategies]{.underline}.

For example, the [many official Russian statements claim]{.underline}ing
[Russia's right to deploy nuclear weapons]{.underline} [in
Crimea]{.underline} reflects efforts to intimidate the West from acting
against Moscow and to convey Moscow's determination to retain Crimea,
and thus to deter any action against its overall policies in Ukraine.
Russian nuclear weapons and multiplying nuclear threats---including
long-range bomber patrols against the United States and Europe---aim to
deter any Western action against Russia, and to intimidate the West into
accepting Russian conquests as irrevocable faits accompli. [This
political use of nuclear weapons is not confined to the present
crisis]{.underline}. Similar moves reportedly occurred during the 2008
Georgian war,49 affirming Moscow's belief that if it lacked nuclear
weapons, the West might intervene against Russian aggression in the CIS.
[Russia sees its nuclear arsenal,]{.underline} in part, [as the
instrument that can prevent robust Western responses to its aggression
and occupation of neighboring territories]{.underline}. This is a new
and fundamentally coercive role for Russian nuclear weapons and does not
reflect Western mutual nuclear deterrence notions of the Cold War.
[Russian statements about nuclear weapons have moved beyond the clear
desire to deter and intimidate the West to include potential operational
employment]{.underline}. As the British analyst Roger McDermott has
written, [The Russian military understanding of these weapons and
reliance on them in certain scenarios suggests that they play a
significant role in security thinking, which]{.underline} has grown and
[may continue to grow]{.underline} until Russia can successfully redress
its conventional weaknesses. This is borne out in official statements,
as well as in the role assigned to them in operational-strategic
exercises .... [It is therefore important to understand that Russia
regards these weapons differently than the West: for Moscow they do not
simply have political value, they play a role in military planning that
compensates for conventional weakness, and in certain scenarios are
considered to be operational systems]{.underline}.50 [Thus, Russian
nuclear weapons]{.underline}, whether they be strategic or tactical
nuclear weapons **[could]{.underline}**, in severe circumstances, **[be
used in combat operations]{.underline}**. The apparent Russian
willingness to employ nuclear weapons likely contributes to their
coercive effect.

### AT 'risky business'

#### This article [assumes]{.underline} \[with little evidence\] that there is no Russian national security threat, and admits that their calculation would be different if the threat was proven

**Thrall 18** -- Trevor, "Risky Business: The Role of Arms Sales in U.S.
Foreign Policy," CATO,
<https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#full>

[In sum, the strategic value of arms sales for the United States is very
low given today's security environment. **Different circumstances would
produce a different analysis**]{.underline}. Although [today there is
little reason for the United States to worry about the Russian
threat]{.underline} to Europe, during the Cold War foreign policy
experts agreed that preventing the Soviet Union from dominating the
European continent was critical to American security. As a result, the
United States sensibly provided NATO allies with advanced weapons. This
strategy greatly enhanced the fighting capability of NATO, thereby
bolstering deterrence and ensuring European security.

[Today]{.underline}, **[happily]{.underline}**, [the United States faces
no such threats]{.underline}. For this reason, the argument in favor of
arms sales cannot rest on national security grounds but must rest
instead on "national interest" grounds, that is, on the benefits gained
from helping other nations improve their own security, and from
maintaining conditions generally believed to be in the national
interest, such as regional stability or the prevention of war. This is
already a much weaker position than the conventional wisdom
acknowledges. Even worse for such sales' advocates, however, is the fact
that arms sales are notoriously uncertain tools for achieving those
objectives.

## AT IMPACT TURNS

### AT Russian collapse

#### Putin is resilient

**Miller** 12-29-20**16** -- PhD, associate director of the
Brady-Johnson Program in Grand Strategy at Yale University and the
author of "The Struggle to Save the Soviet Economy: Mikhail Gorbachev
and the Collapse of the U.S.S.R." (Chris, "Why Putin's Economy
Survives," *Wall Street Journal*, Factiva)//BB

[In the late 1980s, as the Soviet economy began to freeze up, Vladimir
Putin was a KGB agent in Dresden, East Germany. Mr. Putin suffered
firsthand from the Soviet empire's demise and vowed never to let such a
catastrophe happen again. The primary lesson he drew was simple: avoid
large deficits and high inflation]{.underline}. [Since taking power in
1999, Mr. Putin has studiously implemented a conservative macroeconomic
policy. This has let him weather crises that many observers expected
would bring down his regime. In mid-2014, oil prices began to collapse,
and the West slammed financial sanctions on Russia]{.underline} for its
invasion of Ukraine. **[But Mr. Putin is still standing]{.underline}**.
Where the Soviets suffered from an exploding budget deficit, financed by
money creation, [today's Russia has pushed through an aggressive
austerity program, slashing spending on social programs and pensions to
balance the budget]{.underline}. The Bank of Russia has hiked interest
rates to double-digit levels, driving inflation down to 6%, a
respectable figure for an emerging market. The Kremlin's budget deficit
will be a bit more than 3% of GDP this year, even though oil---which
previously provided half of government revenues---is now selling for
half its price two years ago. And [Russia's government debt remains less
than 20% of GDP, according to Russian government statistics. America's
public debt, by contrast, is more than 75% of GD]{.underline}P,
according to the Federal Reserve. [This conservative fiscal posture
helps explain why, unlike the U.S.S.R., Mr. Putin's Russia has proven so
**unexpectedly** **resilient**]{.underline}. [Despite Western financial
sanctions, large Russian firms continue to attract the foreign-currency
funding that they need. Despite the commodity crash, Russian oil
production is at a post-Soviet high. Russia's economy is returning to
growth even as Russia's military wages war in Ukraine and Syria. The
Kremlin has mustered the resources that it needs to deploy power at home
and abroad, even amid conditions similar to those that bankrupted the
Soviets]{.underline}. 'Putin has expropriated his rivals, tolerated epic
corruption and sent investors fleeing.' Russia's economic
accomplishments shouldn't be overstated, of course. [Mr. Putin has
expropriated his rivals, tolerated epic corruption and sent investors
fleeing]{.underline}. The Russian state plays a far larger role in the
economy today than it did when Mr. Putin took power---not to provide
useful services such as health or education but to monopolize oil
production and fund his patronage networks. Russian wages grew rapidly
in the 2000s, but growth has since slowed---and even reversed. [Yet on
the economic issues **crucial to the survival of Mr. Putin's regime, the
record is far better**. Macroeconomic stability has underwritten a
decade and a half of relative prosperity]{.underline}. The coming
anniversary of the Soviet collapse won't be widely marked in Moscow.
[The demise of the U.S.S.R. is a period most Russians would prefer to
forget---and a catastrophe that Mr. Putin is determined not to
repeat.]{.underline}

"Russia's plot against the West,"
<https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-plot-against-the-west-vladimir-putin-donald-trump-europe/)//BB>

[The annexation of Crimea and invasion of Eastern Ukraine is a warning
shot]{.underline} across the bow of the West, a message, written in
blood, that the old ways of doing business are over. Less implausible is
Russia's ability to alter the political trajectory of Western politics
in a way that suits its geopolitical aims. Last year in the Netherlands,
a motley collection of Russian expatriates, far-right nationalists and
left-wingers banded together to defeat a referendum on an EU trade
agreement with Ukraine. Though the Dutch intelligence agency could find
no hard evidence of direct Russian government support to the opposition
side, it did conclude that the Netherlands is a target in Moscow's
"global campaign to influence policy and perceptions on Russia," and
that the Kremlin has mobilized a "network of contacts built up over the
years." Speaking of Russia's suspected involvement in this week's
parliamentary election, a Dutch foreign policy analyst told the New York
Times that, "A little effort goes a long way" and could "destroy the
European Union from inside." While waging a nonviolent war against the
West from within, Russia is rapidly building up its military capacities
and engaging in kinetic action along Europe's. Over the course of
Putin's 17-year reign, Russian defense spending has increased 20-fold.
Arms procurement grew by 60 percent in 2015 alone. [Kremlin rhetoric
over the past several years has]{.underline} also [shifted in a
disturbingly confrontational direction]{.underline}. [Putin's recent
justification for the infamous Molotov-Ribbentrop pact between Nazi
Germany and the Soviet Union]{.underline}---stating, alongside a stunned
Merkel, that the infamous agreement which divided up Eastern Europe
between the two totalitarian powers "ensur\[ed\] the security of the
USSR"---[epitomizes the moral failure of Russian elites to come to terms
with the Soviet past]{.underline}. Other Russian officials, meanwhile,
engage in shockingly loose talk about using nuclear weapons and Russian
military exercises frequently end with simulated nuclear strikes on NATO
capitals. The West has neither acknowledged the threat from Russia nor
adequately prepared to defend itself against potential aggression. Only
four European members of NATO commit the recommended 2 percent of their
GDP to defense; so poorly equipped is the Bundeswehr that its soldiers
infamously had to use broomstick handles instead of guns during a
training exercise. This is why [Russia's war in Ukraine is about far
more than Ukraine]{.underline}. The annexation of Crimea and invasion of
Eastern Ukraine is a warning shot across the bow of the West, a message,
written in blood, that [the old ways of doing business are
over]{.underline}. "Protecting" ethnic Russians was never the issue for
Putin; Russian intervention was about exerting a veto over Ukraine's
Western path. Moscow's highly sophisticated execution of hybrid war, a
forecast of conflict to come, belies the haughty complacency of people
like Obama and his hapless secretary of state, John Kerry, who scoffed
that Russia is trapped in "the 19th century." On the contrary, it is the
allegedly backwards Russians who have adapted their war-fighting
capabilities to the future, and the supposedly advanced Westerners who
have been caught in their dust. To quote Lenin again, what is to be
done? [To avert catastrophe, it is imperative that the United States
pivot back to Europe]{.underline}. As a collective political entity,
Europe is America's most important ally, with whom we share values and
interests. Abandoning Europe at this time would create a political and
security vacuum on the Continent, one that would inevitably be filled by
Russia. In response to Brexit, the U.S. election and the rise of
populists across Europe, many in the West are beginning to question the
assumptions upon which the postwar liberal world order stands. While
introspection is necessary, we do not need to rethink first principles.
Protectionism remains wrong, both morally and economically. NATO remains
the bedrock of our security, no matter how many times certain
individuals call it "obsolete." The postwar international system has
benefited America enormously; it's not a rip-off. Lavrov's call for a
"post-Western world order" is not new; Russian leaders have frequently
floated proposals aimed at diluting the Western-led international system
by incorporating a non-democratic Russia into its structures. The West
wants peace and Russia wants victory. These desires are incompatible.
Increasingly, these calls for reassessing the liberal world order are
finding an audience on this side of the ocean, where voices posit that
it has outlived its usefulness. In a combination of astonishing
historical illiteracy and sinister prophecy, the president's senior
counselor says he wants to make the world "as exciting as the 1930s" and
that "strong nationalist movements in countries make strong neighbors."
Meanwhile, a leading figure in what passes for the pro-Trump
intellectual movement, who now serves as a high-ranking national
security official in the administration, asks of NATO, "What is the
alliance for once its original purpose has evaporated?" The original
purpose of NATO was "to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the
Germans down." With exception of that last part about Germany, whose
neighbors want it to play a more assertive role in continental defense
and security, the founding rationale for the Atlantic Alliance endures.
The fundamentals remain; the arrangements we have are working. They need
strengthening, not a redesign. [The West wants peace and Russia wants
victory. These desires are incompatible]{.underline}. Those who cherish
liberal democracy and wish to see it endure must accept the fact that a
Russian regime is once against trying to debilitate and subvert the free
world. While Russia today may not be as conventionally strong an
adversary as it was during the Cold War, the threat it poses is more
diffuse. Russia is as much an enemy today as it was a generation ago,
and we need to adopt a more hardheaded, adversarial footing and
mentality to defeat it. In a globalized world where the cancerous
influences of Russian money and disinformation can more easily corrupt
us than when an Iron Curtain divided Europe, and where the ideological
terrain is more confusing than the Cold War's rigid bipolarity,
containing Russia presents different challenges than it did a generation
ago, not the least of which is maintaining Western unity against a more
ambiguous adversary skilled at fighting asymmetrically. Never during the
Cold War, for instance, was there such a traumatic break within the
Western political alliance as Britain's departure from the European
Union---nor, for that matter, did an overtly pro-Russian leader ever
capture the presidency of the United States. If the Putin regime cannot
live alongside a democratic West, [a democratic West cannot live with
the Putin regime. A genuinely democratic Russia would feel no threat
from Europe, and thus lack the impulse to debase and disrupt
it]{.underline}. To be sure, the illiberal movements currently roiling
the EU would exist regardless of Russia; anyone remotely familiar with
the Continent's bloody history knows that Europeans don't require
outside instigation to fall for the siren songs of chauvinism, populism
and other illiberal forces. But [**only absent the revisionist and
belligerent regime in Moscow** is a Europe whole, free and at **peace
possible**]{.underline}.

### NU -- arms sales

#### Russian arms sales are increasing now

**Savitsky 11-12**-20**18** -- military analyst based in St Petersburg,
Russia. (Arkady, "US Pressure Fails to Affect Russia's Growing Arms
Exports," Strategic Culture Foundation,
<https://www.strategic-culture.org/news/2018/11/12/us-pressure-fails-to-affect-russia-growing-arms-exports/)//BB>

On November 6, Russian President Vladimir Putin chaired a meeting of the
Commission for Military Technology Cooperation with Foreign States. He
noted that "Our capabilities in the military technical sphere must be
used to modernize and upgrade all our industries, to support our science
and to create a powerful technological potential for the country's
dynamic development." The president called for "renewed efforts, not
only, in preserving, but also, in strengthening Russia's leading
position on the global arms market, primarily in the high-tech sector,
amid tough competition." [The US efforts to press other countries into
suspending military cooperation with Russia are
inefficient]{.underline}. [The number of customers, especially in the
Middle East and Africa, is growing. The demand for Russia's military
production is]{.underline} especially [high in the
Asia-Pacific]{.underline} Region, accounting for almost 70% of all arms
sales, including India (35%), China (12%) and Vietnam (10%).Today,
[Russia's overall military exports are equal to around \$15
billion]{.underline}, with the global order book of \$55 billion.
According to Alexander Mikheev, the head of
[Rosoboronexport]{.underline}, the sole state intermediary agency for
Russia\'s defense exports / imports, Russia [has already exported arms
to over 40 countries, signing 1,100 contracts worth about \$19 billion
in 2018]{.underline} -- **[a 25% increase compared to the last
year]{.underline}**. The president's speech coincided with the opening
ceremony of Airshow China 2018 (Nov. 6-11), one of the five largest
aerospace exhibitions in the world, Russian manufacturers scored a big
success. 14 defense producers displayed over 200 units of hardware.
[China has defied US threats to go through with the large deal to buy
S-400 air defense systems and Su-35 multifunctional
fighters]{.underline} (ten jets already delivered). The joint programs,
such as the development of a heavy AHL helicopter and a long-range
powerful aircraft, are in force. The order book of China's imports
exceeds \$7 billion, growing from 5% to 14-15%. The two nations are
involved in a joint project to produce diesel-electric submarines
Amur-1650 (export version of Lada Project 677). [This is a \$2 billion
deal]{.underline}. China confirmed the plan to purchase six Mi-171A2Y
"Ansat" helicopters, which will make a 5,000 km long demonstration tour
across Southeast Asia, including stops at Hanoi (Vietnam), Phnom Penh
(Cambodia), Bangkok (Thailand) and Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia). VKO concern
\"Almaz-Antey\" used the Airshow China 2018 event to introduce the
Viking -- the export version of the Buk-M3 anti-aircraft missile system.
Viking boasts the range of 65 km. 36 targets can be tracked and engaged
simultaneously. It has the capability of striking tactical ballistic and
cruise missiles as well as sea and ground targets. The Radioelectronic
Technologies Company (KRET) presented over 40 exhibits, including the
multipurpose airborne multipurpose radar with AFAR \"Beetle-AME\"
designed to detect and track aerial, surface and ground targets at the
same time. The Russian-Chinese long-overhaul CR929 jet attracted public
attention at the air show. Its basic version will carry 280 passengers
over a distance of 12,000 km. [India has also defied the US pressure and
will start receiving receive S-400s in the fall of 2020]{.underline}.
[The \$5 billion deal was signed in October during the visit
of]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir [Putin to New
Delhi]{.underline}. Russia and Vietnam have signed a \$4.5 billion
package of deals, including the \$1 billion purchase of a batch of
Russian Su-30 MK2 fighters and a \$2 billion agreement on the sale of
six Russian diesel-electric Project 636.1 Varshavyanka (Kilo)
submarines. A Mi-35M attack helicopters deal with to Bangladesh is
expected to be inked soon. In February, Russia signed a \$ 1.14 deal
with Indonesia to supply 11 Su-35 4++ generation fighters. 2018 is rich
in international defense shows. As of November 12, Russia has taken part
in about 20 international exhibitions and forums, such as the Eurasian
Air Show in Turkey's Antalya, International Far Eastern Maritime Show in
Vladivostok and ADAS-2018 defense exhibition in the Philippines (for the
first time). It intends to attend some more large ones till the end of
the year. Russia has also taken part in the Indo Defense 2018 show
(Nov.7-10) to display over 200 systems and equipment units. There were
two weapons presented for the first time ever in Jakarta: the 122 mm
projectile for Tornado-G MLRS and 140 mm projectile for ship-based Ogon
flame throwing launcher. There will be the IDEAS-2018 exhibition in
Pakistan in late November, EDEX-2018 will be held in Egypt in
mid-December, and Chile will host the EXPONAVAL -- 2018 naval exhibition
in early December. Russia will take an active part in all of them though
its presence at Le Bourget Paris air show in June was very limited and
it decided to take no part in Farnborough -- 2018 air show in July.
Moscow prefers the shows where it has more potential customers. This
year, some new systems were offered to potential buyers, such the Viking
and Tor-E2 anti-aircraft missile systems, Sprut-SDM1 light floating
tank, Karakut and Sarsar vessels, Il-78MK-90A aerial tanker and
Il-76MD-90A (E) military cargo aircraft. The Sprut-SDM1 light tank is a
special case. The airborne light amphibious tank with firepower of MBT
has no rivals in the world. [The US-imposed sanctions have failed to
reduce the demand for Russian weapons. China, India as well as many
other countries refuse to bow]{.underline}. New ways to pay for the
deals without dollars are sought. For instance, India will pay for
S-400s in Russian rubles. The talks to get around dollars are underway
with China. Some deals may be temporarily postponed, some talks frozen,
but all in all, [the US policy of using sanctions to reduce Russia arms
exports and thus weaken the competitor has failed]{.underline}. [The
most important agreements, including the S400 deal with Turkey, a NATO
country, have not been affected]{.underline}. This agreement will also
skirt dollar payments. The **[Russian arms sales are on the
rise]{.underline}**.

### NU -- arms sales -- Pakistan

#### Russia recently sealed a new 9 billion dollar deal with Pakistan

**Shabbir 4-19**-2019 -- Ambreen, "Pakistan to Make a Major
Multi-Billion Dollar Arms Deal With Russia: Report,"
<https://propakistani.pk/2019/04/19/pakistan-to-make-a-major-multi-billion-dollar-arms-deal-with-russia-report/>

[For years, China has remained the major arms supplier to
Pakistan]{.underline}, especially after the latter decided to reduce its
reliance on the US. The ties between the two countries have closely
revolved around the defense purchases. It implies that the South Asian
superpower has somewhat monopoly over Pakistan's defense market where
the competition is quite low. [In a bid to turnaround the situation,
Russia is looking forward to making inroads into Pakistan's arms
market]{.underline}. According to a Russian news agency, [Pakistan has
shown interest in purchasing Russian military hardware.]{.underline}
[**The deal is expected to amount \$9 billion** under which Islamabad
would purchase heavy and medium fighter jets, medium and short-range air
defense systems, tanks, combat helicopters, and warships]{.underline}.
Prospects of Pak-Russia Arms Deal [The agency has cited Konstantin
Makienko, the deputy director of the Moscow-based defense think tank
Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies. Makeinko revealed
that two types of Russian military hardware can make Pakistan's shopping
list]{.underline}, i.e., the new Russian fighter jet MiG-35 and the
heavy transport helicopter Mi-26T2.

### NU -- arms sales -- Middle East

#### Specifically \-\-- they are expanding in the Middle East

**Khlebnikov 19** - expert on the Middle East at the Russian
International Affairs Council (Alexey, "Russia looks to the Middle East
to boost arms exports," *Middle East Institute*,
https://www.mei.edu/publications/russia-looks-middle-east-boost-arms-exports)

[According to]{.underline} the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute's ([SIPRI]{.underline}) recently published annual report,
[Russia's share of global arms exports shrank by around one-fifth over
the last decade]{.underline}, falling from 27 percent to 21 percent,
while the U.S. share increased from 30 percent to 36 percent, widening
the gap between the two major arms exporters. [As Russia looks to
reverse this decline, it is focusing on the Middle East, the world's
second-largest and fastest-growing arms market, as a way to boost its
exports]{.underline}. While it is early days, **[the effort seems to be
paying off]{.underline}** so far. According to Russian media reports,
[Russia and Egypt recently signed a new arms deal worth at least \$2
billion]{.underline}. [This deal]{.underline}, which involves the
purchase of over 20 4++ generation Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets
(Flanker-E), [makes Egypt a major importer of Russian arms]{.underline}
and comes on top of previous deals between the two countries for tens of
MiG-29 jets, Ka-52K helicopters, and coastal defense units. [In addition
to the deal with Egypt, Russia is also moving ahead with the sale of the
S-400 anti-aircraft system to Turkey in yet another confirmation of
Moscow's growing focus on the Middle East]{.underline}.

### NU -- military spending

#### Military spending is [already high]{.underline} \-\-- anything contrary is [fudged numbers]{.underline}

**Baev 5-6**-2019 -- PhD, senior researcher at the International Peace
Research Institute (Pavel, "Is Russia Really Cutting Its Military
Spending?," *Eurasia Daily Monitor*, 16.65)//BB

[Military force remains a predominant instrument of choice for Russian
policymakers; yet, state expenditures on the Armed Forces continue to
decline]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} paradoxical [situation was
recently highlighted by]{.underline} the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute's ([SIPRI]{.underline}) latest global military
balance assessment, [which the Russian media eagerly picked
up]{.underline} (Kommersant, April 29). [SIPRI]{.underline} methodology
is long-established and respected by experts. And yet, its [latest
assessment]{.underline} demoting Russia to sixth position in the world
behind France **[looks]{.underline}** not only counterintuitive but, in
fact, **[plain wrong]{.underline}**. Of course, to some degree, the
impression that Russia must still be spending a fortune on its military
is partly shaped by the assertive political rhetoric coming out of
Moscow, which is amplified by official propaganda and reinforced by
exuberant public demonstrations---like the military parade scheduled to
roll over Red Square, on Victory Day, celebrated in Russia every May 9
(Krasnaya Zvezda, April 29). Nevertheless, [significant material
evidence exists to raise doubts about the government's declared 3.5
percent reduction in military spending]{.underline} in 2018. To its
credit, SIPRI does not take the official data uncritically, but even the
best research efforts can only go so far in correcting the deliberate
distortions produced by Russia's main statistical agency, Rosstat
(Kommersant, April 6). [Every year, more and more parameters of the
defense budget have become secret and denied even to the State
Duma]{.underline} (lower chamber of parliament), in violation of basic
legislation (Vedomosti, October 17, 2018). It is also clear that a
direct conversion of expenditures from rubles to US dollars using the
current exchange rate produces serious errors because [the pricing
mechanism in the Russian defense-industrial complex is obscure: the
Armed Forces obtain new weapons for a price substantially different from
what foreign customers pay]{.underline} (RBC, April 29). In
macro-economic estimates, the indicator of "purchasing power parity" is
increasingly used for international comparisons; and a rough (because of
secrecy) application of this method to defense expenditures
approximately triples Russia's stated military budget (Defense News, May
3). President Vladimir Putin excels at praising Russia's military might
and boasting about new technologically advanced weapon systems, such as
the nuclear-propelled underwater vehicle Poseidon (Nezavisimoe Voennoe
Obozrenie, April 26). He used the occasion of launching the nuclear
submarine Belgorod (in construction since 1992), which is supposed to
carry Poseidons onboard, to concurrently supervise the laying of keels
of four other combat ships (Moskovsky Komsomolets, April 23). This
ceremony could not quite camouflage the deep problems in Russian
shipbuilding, however, which struggles with fulfilling orders for the
new Yasen-class nuclear submarines as well as with repairs of Russia's
only aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov, and other Soviet-era
cruisers (see EDM, April 25). The Russian navy received little attention
in the 2027 State Armament Program, which was approved with delays only
in early 2018 because the government insisted on cuts bitterly contested
by various lobbies (Nezavisimoe Voennoe Obozrenie, April 12, 2019).
[Putin often claims that Russia will not repeat the Soviet blunder of
channeling too many resources toward military needs and will pursue the
arms race on the cheap]{.underline} (Forbes.ru, April 29). The economy
is, indeed, stuck in a protracted recession; and discontent caused by
the sustained decline in incomes and increase to the retirement age is
deepening (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, April 25). [Growing public demand for
social benefits thus raises the political need for the authorities to
**hide the real costs of Russia's militarization**]{.underline}.

### No L -- China fills in

#### China, [not Russia]{.underline}, fills in \-\-- they'll sell high quality products to states facing western restrictions \-\-- AND, their products are [cheaper]{.underline}

**Halder** 2-25-20**19** (Ben, "CHINA, THE NEXT BIG SUPPLIER OF
HIGH-TECH ARMS TO EMERGING NATIONS," Ozy,
<https://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/china-the-next-big-supplier-of-high-tech-arms-to-emerging-nations/92647)//BB>

[China is emerging as a **fast-growing** supplier of affordable,
high-tech weapons systems to countries facing]{.underline} sanctions or
[restrictions from the West]{.underline}. [Models donning metallic
outfits and ill-fitting red baseball caps posed at the China
International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition in Zhuhai]{.underline},
Guangdong province, in November 2018. But the star attractions were the
newest arsenal of Chinese weapons systems on display: from mine-clearing
robots and high-speed unmanned helicopters to stealth drones and radar
protection technology for tanks. In all, deals worth \$21 billion were
struck. And [the show was just one sign of China's growing clout in a
field traditionally dominated by the West, Russia and Israel: high-tech
military equipment]{.underline}. [China's]{.underline} rapid expansion
over the past two decades into Africa, Latin America and across Asia has
relied on its growing economic resources and has taken the form of heavy
investments, funding and infrastructure projects. Its military exports
were largely bare-bones equipment. Now, [the world's second-largest
economy]{.underline} is [fast positioning itself as an attractive
supplier of relatively affordable high-tech military
hardware]{.underline} [to]{.underline} an increasing number of emerging
[economies facing sanctions or restrictions from the West]{.underline}.
[The country's arms sales to Africa grew by 55 percent]{.underline}
between 2012 and 2017 compared to the previous five-year period,
totaling \$273 million in 2017. Of those sales, [42 percent of exports
landed in North Africa --- a region long plagued by U.S.]{.underline}
and European [arms embargoes]{.underline} and a more general reluctance
from these suppliers to do business. Today, 80 percent of trainer jets
across Africa are the Chinese-made K-8 planes, and with advancements in
China's aviation industry, particularly the development of an indigenous
jet engine, Chinese aircraft are becoming more attractive to African
customers. China is now marketing its indigenous, armed unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) to potential buyers in Egypt and Nigeria. Closer to
home, China in March 2018 announced a deal to sell Pakistan a
large-scale optical tracking system used to accelerate the development
of intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear
payloads. It was the first example of China exporting sensitive
technology. Pakistan is facing restrictions from the U.S. on weapons
sales because of differences on terrorism and Afghanistan. State-owned
China South Industries Group is aggressively pitching its mine-clearing
laser gun to international customers such as Myanmar, which already
relies on China for 68 percent of its weapons because of E.U. and U.S.
sanctions. And Venezuela, which imports 23 percent of its weapons from
China, showed off a cache of new Chinese-built military vehicles at a
parade in July 2018. China is also pitching a new generation of laser
weapons to Venezuela. These include the China Aerospace Science and
Industry Corp.'s LW-30 laser defense system and China Shipbuilding
Industry Corp.'s vehicle-mounted laser weapon, both launched at the
Zhuhai Air Show in November 2018. "The one advantage that African
countries, and for that matter any other country that considers China as
an acceptable arms supplier, will have is that the number of suppliers
of more advanced equipment is increasing, which improves the bargaining
position," says Pieter Wezeman, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms
Transfers and Military Expenditure Programme. Some of China's earliest
successes in selling high-tech military equipment came earlier this
decade, in the Middle East, with drones. The U.S. has strict rules on
who it can sell UAVs to, and several Middle Eastern nations have had
requests to America turned down. So, "China stepped in and offered its
alternatives," says Wezeman. Since 2014, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Jordan and
Iraq have all bought military drones from China. These UAVs have been
deployed in wars against ISIS and in Yemen. But [the country's
willingness to sell weapons systems to virtually anyone gives China a
distinct edge in carving out a niche for itself in the global arms
market, and its ability to deliver high-tech machines at **cheaper rates
than competitors** also attracts potential buyers]{.underline}. China's
most advanced UAV, the CH-5 Rainbow, costs half as much as the \$16.9
million U.S.-made Reaper. China's base model can be acquired for just
\$1 million. Four of China's Type 054A frigates were recently ordered by
Pakistan at a unit cost of \$250 million, compared to a price tag of
\$466 million for the similarly sized French-built La Fayette model.
Speaking to the Global Times newspaper, one of the Chinese Communist
Party's mouthpieces, Beijing-based military analyst Wei Dongxu claimed
in November that the country's new HD-1 supersonic missile, known as an
aircraft carrier killer, would hit the market at a significantly lower
price than existing products. This includes undercutting the \$2.75
million BrahMos missile, developed by Russia and India.

#### China will [out-compete]{.underline} peers like Russia \-\-- has advanced weaponry and is no longer reliant on ex-Soviet weaponry

While it may not yet be the dominant player, [China's arms export
strategy has proved effective in **taking market share from competitor
nations**]{.underline}.

Is China's arms export strategy really a success story? The first
question is to establish whether there has been dramatic growth in
China's arms exports, emulating the success of its broader commercial
exports. While the picture is not equivocal, there are signs that
something is indeed happening. [Chinese arms sales are
growing]{.underline}. Across 2012--16, they accounted for 6.2 per cent
of the global arms trade, up by an impressive 74 per cent compared to
2007--11. In fact, over 2012--16, China's arms exports raced ahead of
those from Germany, France and the United Kingdom, making China the
world's third biggest arms exporter. [This is not a short-term
aberration, but a long-term trend]{.underline}. Between 2000 and 2015,
Chinese arms exports expanded by a factor of 6.5. In 2016, China shipped
US\$2.1 billion in arms, marginally behind France's US\$2.2 billion, but
well ahead of the United Kingdom's US\$1.4 billion. While China's 2016
market share is well below that of the United States at 33 per cent, the
gap is gradually closing with Russia (23 per cent), and has disappeared
altogether with France (6 per cent), Germany (5.6 per cent) and the
United Kingdom (4.6 per cent). [China's arms exports have been
criticised for lacking global appeal]{.underline} since 72 per cent of
all exports in the last five years went to just three countries:
Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar. [Yet, this criticism is
unfair]{.underline}. Such [dependence on a few core customers affects
both mature and 'new entrant' arms exporters alike.]{.underline} Russia
was the world's second biggest arms exporter across 2012--16 but relied
on just four countries --- India, Vietnam, China and Algeria --- for 70
per cent of those sales. Likewise, 71 per cent of UK arms exports go to
India, the United States and Saudi Arabia (which alone accounted for
half of all UK sales across 2010--15). [Detractors argue that China's
weapons are only attractive to poorer nations because its older weapons
are cheaper. While there is some truth in this argument, it needs
qualification. China has been successful in diversifying its customer
base and now exports arms to 55 countries worldwide]{.underline},
covering Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. Many of
China's clients are indeed developing countries. For example, two-thirds
of the countries situated in the world's poorest continent, Africa,
procure weapon systems from China, and much of it is basic military
equipment. But [times are changing. Chinese arms are **no longer
relics** from a bygone Soviet era]{.underline}. [The PLA has been
replacing old Soviet platforms with improved 'indigenous' models and is
now exporting modernised platforms]{.underline}, including Type-99 MBTs,
J-10 fighters and Yuan-class submarines to Thailand, Myanmar, Bangladesh
and Pakistan. [China has also adapted, innovated and engaged in systems
integration in a determined bid to move up the technology
ladder]{.underline}, developing, for instance, credible and competitive
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and anti-ship cruise missiles. Raised
technological sophistication combined with relatively low procurement
cost has led to increasingly cost-effective arms exports. Their
attractiveness to more discerning buyers has been translated into a
sales portfolio in which 25 per cent of China's customers are now
positioned in the upper middle/higher income country categories,
including Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. [Is there
something different, something special, that distinguishes China's arms
export strategy]{.underline} from its Western counterparts? The answer
is a resounding **[yes]{.underline}**. First and foremost, Western
strategists should not be under any illusion that export revenue is the
primary goal. Rather, [Beijing's end-game is longer-term geo-political
and strategic influence]{.underline}. The search for regional and global
influence is the critical aim of Chinese economic diplomacy. It reflects
a more narrowly focused aspect of Beijing's soft power framework,
embracing foreign aid, foreign direct investment, overseas educational
programs and, importantly, arms sales. China's arms export model
operates according to a carefully-crafted strategy based on three
principles: promoting the legitimate self-defence capability of the
recipient country; strengthening the peace, security and stability of
that country and region; and non-interference in its internal affairs.
Beijing's long-standing approach of linking non-interference to arms
sales rests on the view that a customer's political, military and human
rights record lies outside the contractual arrangements. [The 'no
questions asked' policy attracts the opprobrium of Western states, but
there is no disputing its effectiveness in selling guns and securing
influence]{.underline}. [The policy particularly appeals to]{.underline}
second- and third-tier military [states suffering excessive dependence
on US or Russian weaponry]{.underline}. [Chinese arms offer poorer
states the opportunity to diversify arms sources]{.underline}, regain a
degree of sovereignty over military capability and reduce strategic
vulnerability to arms embargoes. The Chinese arms export model has
several other significant features. From a Chinese strategic
perspective, it leverages strong client-state relationships and in the
process bolsters Beijing's influence, particularly among neighbouring
states. It is no accident that China's arms sales to Pakistan, Sri
Lanka, Bangladesh and Myanmar indirectly act to contain the potential
threat of Asia's other mega-power, India. Chinese arms are also
competitively packaged. Pricing is low compared to Western models.
Chinese drones, for example, reportedly cost 10--20 per cent of the
near-equivalent US version. Finally, China is amenable to technology
transfer through defence offset, supporting client states to indigenise
maintenance, repair and overhaul activities and even produce components.
While it may not yet be the dominant player, **[China's arms export
strategy has proved effective in taking market share from competitor
nations]{.underline}**. [China has also begun to encroach into higher
income marke]{.underline}ts, especially where technological
sophistication is not required. [There is a long-term strategy at work
here]{.underline}, driven by diplomatic and geostrategic objectives, not
commercial gain.

[It is unlikely that Russian arms sales will disappear]{.underline} in
the near future, [but their strategic pull is weakening. Influence and
leverage]{.underline}, as arms export analyst Andrew Pierre notes,
[are]{.underline} indeed [transitory]{.underline} phenomena.687 While
[Putin]{.underline} has successfully integrated arms sales into his
strategy of fostering polycentrism, challenging American hegemony, and
reestablishing Russia's presence globally, his strategic end state of
returning Russia to its former world power status lacks international
attractiveness. Furthermore, his [focus on short-term political gains in
lieu of a more farsighted plan to achieve his strategic end state
has]{.underline} ~~handicapped~~ \[[limited]{.underline}\] [his use of
arms exports]{.underline}.688 In fact, [arms sales have merely
supported]{.underline} multiple [pragmatic relationships, not an
anti-Western coalition]{.underline}, as states seek to maximize their
benefits at the expense of Russia. As Lo observes, Putin's policy "is
frequently held hostage to short-term political and economic
expediency\...and the over-personalization of decision-making."689 Thus,
while [Russia's]{.underline} recent [dispersal of arms]{.underline}
might strengthen the ability of other states to either reduce the power
of the West or promote regional balancing, it [do]{.underline}es [not
mean that Russia's overall strength and influence rise]{.underline}
reciprocally. For [as long as Putin's strategy remains myopic as he
seeks partners in a quixotic quest to renew Russia's grandeur and global
influence, states will continue to gain reverse leverage on
Russia]{.underline}. Recently imprisoned anti-Putin activist Aleksey
Navalny phrased it best in his ominous foreshowing of Putin's future:
This regime is doomed, I've said it and I will repeat it, but of course,
I will not mention specific dates: in the eleventh year I said that they
had a year and a half left, and I will not say anything more. Doom is
obvious, because \[Putin's regime\] is \[a\] feudal power, in the
post-industrial world unthinkable \[sic\]; because it prevents us from
developing, inventing, building, growing, teaching and healing.690 While
Navalny's words might err on the dramatic, there is truth within them.
[Although Putin might still view arms sales as]{.underline} an
[important]{.underline} item inside his political toolbox, [military
exports are quickly becoming a **dull and impractical instrument**
unable to yield the outcomes that Putin desires regardless of the
previous benefits they once provided]{.underline}.

### ! d -- no threat

#### Russia is not a revisionist threat \-\-- their impact is wildly exaggerated

**Götz** and Merlen **19** -- \*Ph.D. in Political Science from Aarhus
University, Post-doc @ Johns Hopkins, \*\*PhD Candidate in IR @ Kent in
UK (Elias and Camille, "Russia and the question of world order,"
*European Politics and Society*, 20.2)//BB

To begin with, [there are a number of reasons to be sceptical about the
'revanchist Russia' perspective]{.underline}. First, [it adopts an
overly deterministic position, which negates the open-ended character of
history by underlining its predetermined course through certain 'iron
laws' and the supposedly unchanging 'essence' of Russia]{.underline}. In
so doing, this perspective effectively denies the role of individual
agency: Whoever the leader is, or whatever the regime may be, Russians
are subordinate to the quest for imperial greatness. This is a view that
incidentally dovetails with that of extreme Russian nationalists, who
see Russian history in similar holistic terms of a 'single stream' that
connects Ivan IV, Peter the Great, Stalin, and Putin. However, Russia
has experienced tremendous upheavals throughout history that
dramatically changed its society and its relations with the outside
world. This happened often at the instigation of one or a few
individuals. Both the beginning and the end of the Soviet Union, for
example, serve as powerful reminders of the role agency plays in
affecting Moscow's internal and external affairs. Furthermore,
[essentialist claims about Russian identity do not offer much insight
into the dynamics of Moscow's approach to the liberal international
order, which has **significantly fluctuated** over time]{.underline}
(Tsygankov, 2016). Second, [Russia's revisionist behaviour **should not
be exaggerated**]{.underline}. [Its intervention in Ukraine has remained
relatively limited, as has its military activity in other post-Soviet
states]{.underline} (Götz, 2016, p. 9). In fact, the scope of Russia's
revanchist aims is a matter of debate. [It is doubtful whether Moscow
has a blueprint for an alternative international order with different
norms and principles than the current one. Nor does its promotion of
conservative authoritarianism seem to constitute a genuine
agenda]{.underline}. As Lewis (2016) writes, '[the export of
conservative social and political values]{.underline} (...) [has so far
not developed into a coherent campaign, but remains a rather ad hoc and
inchoate critique by Russian politicians]{.underline} of
"multiculturalism", LGBT rights and "political correctness" in Europe.'
Furthermore, [the 'revanchist Russia' perspective is **unable to
account** for the numerous instances in which Moscow has adhered to the
norms, rules, and institutions that are associated with the existing
liberal order.]{.underline} While it might be a stretch to describe
[Moscow]{.underline} as a consistent defender of multilateralism (Lo,
2015), it [has supported]{.underline} frameworks such as [the 2015 Iran
nuclear deal. It also acceded to the World Trade Organization in
2012]{.underline} -- after 19 years of talks -- [and continues to be a
member of the European Court of Human Rights. The liberal goals and
supranational methods of these institutions **hardly fit** with a
revisionist imperial agenda]{.underline}. Third, [Moscow's behaviour is
much more in line with that of an ordinary great power than the
'revanchist Russia' perspective makes it out to be. For one thing,
Russia is by no means unique in its quest to establish a zone of
influence]{.underline} in its near neighbourhood. As Carpenter (2017,
January 19) points out, [Russia is hardly the only country to regard the
\[sphere of influence\] concept as important for its
security]{.underline}. Or do U.S. officials believe that Chinese actions
in the South China Sea, Turkey's policies towards Iraq and Syria, and
Saudi Arabia's actions in Bahrain and Yemen do not involve such a
consideration? For another, [interference in the domestic affairs of
other states is something of a habit for great powers]{.underline}.
Whether they are democratic or authoritarian does not seem to make a
difference in this regard. [The United States, for example, has a long
track record of meddling in the internal affairs and electoral processes
of other countries]{.underline} (Levin, 2016). It is therefore unlikely
that a more democratic Russia will substantially change its key foreign
policy objectives and activities. Furthermore, the discrediting of
Russian concerns over NATO enlargement as an 'imagined' threat, rather
than a 'real' one, misses the mark. [Any international relations scholar
worth their salt knows that uncertainty about others' intentions is
central to security dilemma dynamics]{.underline}. [Thus, Moscow's fears
should not be brushed aside as idiosyncratic Russian
paranoia]{.underline}. In conclusion, it seems fair to say that [the
'revanchist Russia' perspective faces an **array of explanatory
challenges and shortcomings.**]{.underline}

#### Russia's actions are [defensive]{.underline}

**Morris 17** -- writer, with bylines @ Vox, Medium, Jacobin and Counter
Punch (Brett, "3 Reasons It's Time to Chill About Russia," Medium,
<https://medium.com/s/just-world-order/three-reasons-its-time-to-chill-about-russia-717e62b0ab1e)//BB>

After Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 election, one of the few
potentially good outcomes was better relations with Russia. Relations
had been souring for years, especially [after]{.underline} Russia's
takeover of [Crimea]{.underline} in 2014. [Hysteria about Russia and its
president, Vladimir Putin, became absurd]{.underline}: A writer for
Forbes asked if Putin was "another Adolf Hitler," and Republicans in
Congress introduced a Russian Aggression Prevention Act. Now, however,
it is mostly Democrats leading the anti-Russian charge, with potentially
devastating consequences. Putin is no doubt an authoritarian leader, and
Russia has numerous human rights problems, but increasing the animosity
between the world's two leading nuclear powers is stupid. But Democrats
are eager to paint Trump as a Russian puppet in an attempt to undermine
his legitimacy as president and obfuscate the real reasons they lost the
2016 election. (Namely, they knowingly nominated a candidate disliked by
a majority of the population and actively worked to undermine her
primary opponent, who would have been more likely to win a general
election against Trump. In addition, during the Obama years, the
Democratic Party lost control of both houses of Congress, the majority
of state legislatures, and the majority of governorships. Clearly, the
Democratic Party's problems cannot be traced back to Trump and Russia
alone.) With Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 election,
relations between the United States and Russia are now at their worst
since the end of the Cold War. For his part, Trump may favor closer
relations with Russia because of some vague admiration for Putin's
authoritarianism, or maybe business dealings --- no one really knows for
sure. (No one really knows what's going on inside Trump's mind.)
Whatever his reasons, [better relations with Russia would be a good
thing for the world]{.underline}. [Much of the political and foreign
policy establishment want to undermine that goal, and a lot of the
hysteria about Russia takes the country and its motives out of
context]{.underline}. [Russian foreign policy is in significant ways a
**reaction** to U.S. foreign policy.]{.underline} And whatever Moscow's
crimes and contributions to global instability, they don't compare to
Washington's. **[It's time to chill about Russia]{.underline}**. Here
are three reasons why.

**[1. Russia Is a Relatively Weak World Power]{.underline}**

At \$69 billion, [Russia's military expenditures are]{.underline} the
third largest in the world. That's a lot. But it's [a fraction of what
the United States spends]{.underline} (\$611 billion) and trails behind
China (\$215 billion). And [that's after years of Putin expanding
Russia's military]{.underline}. In addition, any kind of military
confrontation between the United States and Russia would involve NATO,
whose members spend a combined total of \$918 billion. Members of the
European Union spend a combined total of about \$238 billion, as well.
[Russian military spending is expected to fall
substantially]{.underline} in 2017, to about \$49 billion. (Earlier this
year, President Trump proposed a \$54 billion increase in U.S. military
spending. In other words, just the increase Trump wants in U.S. military
spending would be more than the entire Russian military budget.)
[Russia's economy is weak]{.underline}. Its GDP is worth \$1.3 trillion
(equivalent to just 7 percent of the U.S. GDP of \$18.6 trillion), and
it's ranked below geographically much smaller countries like Italy and
South Korea. Its economy contracted sharply after the decline in oil
prices, since Russia relies on oil and natural gas for most of its
export revenue, and is expected to grow only 1.4 percent this year.
[Russia is furthermore plagued with the problem of a declining
population.]{.underline} In 2016, the number of deaths exceeded the
number of births. At best, Russia can expect to maintain its current
population of 146 million by 2050, but that number is more likely to
decline and could decrease to fewer than 100 million. As Russia's
population declines, so too will its role on the world stage.

**[2. The Russian Hacking Story Has Been Blown Out of
Proportion]{.underline}** (and Ignores Important Context)

It's beyond the scope of this article to review all the evidence
pertaining to Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 election.
Suffice it to say, Russia likely did interfere in several ways to help
Trump get elected, but there is no evidence that the integrity of the
actual vote was interfered with. Like it or not, nearly 63 million U.S.
citizens voted for Donald Trump, and he won a majority of electors in
the Electoral College, making him a legitimately elected president.
However, the media's endless barrage of information regarding the Russia
story has led many to believe that, essentially, Vladimir Putin
personally installed Trump as president. A YouGov poll taken in May 2017
found that 37 percent of U.S. citizens believe that it is "definitely"
or "probably" true that "Russia tampered with vote tallies in order to
get Donald Trump elected President," including 59 percent of Democrats.
Similar to the Iraq WMD story, in which the media irresponsibly parroted
whatever U.S. officials were telling them (leading to a disastrous war),
the media is now sensationalizing the Russia story, leading many to
believe that Putin is some kind of evil mastermind intent on destroying
the United States. As usual, the context of foreign actors is ignored.
Putting aside the truth of however much Russia "hacked" the election, a
key question is almost never asked: Why would Putin want to do this? If
Putin favored Trump, it probably has less to do with what he represented
and more to do with what Hillary Clinton represented: a continuation, if
not escalation, of hostile policy toward Russia. The recent history of
U.S. and Russian relations is what we should examine if we are to have a
more productive policy toward Russia. Of course, none of this justifies
any Russian interference in the election --- but if we can at least
understand Russia's motives and the context for its actions, we can
adjust policy accordingly. (It also leaves aside blatant hypocrisy on
the part of the United States, which has routinely interfered in the
elections of other countries, including the 1996 Russian election.) As
discussed above, [Russia is a weak power compared to the United
States]{.underline}. [Despite this, the United States has been
surrounding Russia with more and more military might since the end of
the Cold War, **causing Russia to act in antagonistic
ways**]{.underline}. A report from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)
explains Russia's ambitions: Putin has sought to reassert Russia as a
great power on the global stage and to restructure an international
order that the Kremlin believes is tilted too heavily in favor of the
United States at Russia's expense. Moscow seeks to promote a multi-polar
world predicated on the principles of respect for state sovereignty and
non-interference in other states' internal affairs, the primacy of the
United Nations, and a careful balance of power preventing one state or
group of states from dominating the international order. In other words,
[Russia does not seek to dominate the United States, but merely wants
more equality in the international order]{.underline}. The report goes
on to note that Moscow "views the United States and its NATO partners as
the principle threat to Russian security" and "the Kremlin's continued
hold on power." The DIA report explains that Russia views "the buildup
of NATO military capabilities closer to the Russian border, the
deployment of U.S. missile defense capabilities in Europe, and the
ongoing U.S. pursuit of strategic non-nuclear precision weapon systems
as a serious threat to Russian security." Supposedly, NATO was founded
as a form of collective defense with the goal of defending its members
from a Soviet attack. Unlike the Warsaw Pact, however, NATO was not
disbanded after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Instead, it has
expanded and now includes countries on Russia's border --- a development
Russia rightfully views as threatening. (Imagine if the Warsaw Pact
still existed and Russia were actively trying to add countries bordering
the United States to its membership.) NATO's expansion to eastern Europe
goes against promises the United States made to Mikhail Gorbachev during
negotiations over Germany's reunification. In return for the Soviet
Union allowing a unified Germany to be part of a western alliance,
policymakers in the George H.W. Bush administration told Gorbachev that
NATO would not move "one inch eastward." The broken promise has caused
substantial mistrust and bitterness on Russia's part ever since. Russian
policies toward its neighbors, including Ukraine and Georgia, are in
large part based on preventing NATO's further expansion. [In
Ukraine]{.underline}, for example, [Russia considers its actions there
as defensive]{.underline}. As international relations specialist Stephen
M. Walt explains: [The Ukraine crisis did not begin with a bold Russian
move or even a series of illegitimate Russian demands; it began when the
United States and European Union tried to move Ukraine out of Russia's
orbit and into the West's sphere of influence]{.underline}. That
objective may be desirable in the abstract, but [Moscow made it
abundantly clear it would fight this process tooth and nail. U.S.
leaders blithely ignored these warnings]{.underline} --- which clearly
stemmed from Russian insecurity rather than territorial greed --- and
not surprisingly they have been blindsided by Moscow's reaction. As Walt
notes, the "[solution to this crisis is for the United States and its
allies to abandon the dangerous and unnecessary goal of endless NATO
expansion]{.underline} and do whatever it takes to convince Russia that
we want Ukraine to be a neutral buffer state in perpetuity."

#### Russia is inevitably weak and desperate \-\-- no risk of a real great power challenge

**Bechev** 2-17-20**19** -- Nonresident Senior Fellow at the Atlantic
Council (Dimitar, "Resurgent Russia: Myth and reality,"
<https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/resurgent-russia-myth-reality-190217060009723.html)//BB>

[Make Russia Great Again. That is the mission]{.underline} Russian
President Vladimir [Putin seems to have adopted]{.underline} in
international politics. Following his return to the Kremlin in 2012, he
took up a more assertive foreign policy, seeking to secure a seat at the
top table of global diplomacy. The effort has paid off. Thanks to its
military intervention in Syria, Russia has graduated from a bystander to
a leading powerbroker in the Middle East. Showing off this newly
acquired status, Putin recently hosted the presidents of Turkey and
Iran, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Hassan Rouhani, to coordinate a joint
response to US President Donald Trump\'s decision to pull US troops out
of northeast Syria. The summit marked the two-year anniversary of the
so-called Astana Process whose professed goal is to bring the bloodshed
in the embattled Middle Eastern country to an end. Conspicuously enough,
the US is not part of the forum. Astana, therefore, might be a harbinger
of a new global order to come: One in which emergent non-Western powers,
such as Russia, China, India and others run the show. [Over the past few
years, Putin has not shied away from confronting the West]{.underline}.
In his early days as leader, he wholeheartedly sided with the US in the
aftermath of 9/11 and even touted the prospect of Russia joining NATO.
But by the time he delivered his oft-quoted speech at the Munich
Security Conference in 2007, Putin had become convinced that the US and
its allies were seeking to dethrone him by fomenting \"colour
revolutions\" across the post-Soviet space. The Arab uprisings in
2010-2011 only confirmed his fears and, as a prime minister, he publicly
denounced then-President Dmitry Medvedev\'s decision not to block a UN
Security Council resolution authorising a no-fly zone over Libya, which
precipitated the British and French air raids and the ultimate downfall
of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. But the rift with the West became
permanent when Russia annexed Ukraine\'s Crimean Peninsula in the spring
of 2014. Since then, Putin has defied both the US and its European
allies, who imposed sanctions in response to the annexation as well as
to Moscow\'s invasion of Eastern Ukraine, where fighting continues until
the present day. [Perceptions of Russia have shifted as a
result]{.underline}. Up until 2014, the US and the EU considered it a
difficult partner but not a full-fledged adversary. Now, the Pentagon\'s
national defence strategy casts Russia as a military threat on a par
with rising China. NATO has deployed troops in Eastern Europe in order
to dissuade Moscow from pursuing aggressive action beyond its borders.
There are, moreover, mounting fears that Russia is using a variety of
tools, ranging from economic blackmail to cyberattacks and from
disinformation to support for populist right-wing and radical leftist
parties to undermine its Western competitors from within. The ongoing
controversy over Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential elections,
along with the pro-Kremlin rhetoric of anti-immigration politicians in
Europe such as Hungarian President Viktor Orban and Italian Interior
Minister Matteo Salvini, never ceases to generate headlines. The EU has
started talking about \"resilience\" against external influence
campaigns, with its eastern neighbour in mind. **[But Russia is not that
powerful]{.underline}** after all. [Its GDP of \$1.57 trillion is barely
8 percent of the US\' and comparable to that of a mid-sized European
country like Spain]{.underline}. The Eurasian Economic Union (EEU),
which Putin finally managed to create in 2014 after years-long efforts,
is no match for the economic juggernaut that is the EU. [Russia\'s
strategic nuclear arsenal, inherited from the once-mighty Soviet Union,
is at the same level as the US\']{.underline}. Yet, despite the
ambitious military reform over the past decade, the Russian conventional
forces lag far behind the US army\'s in terms of capability and
technological sophistication. At \$63bn, Russia\'s defence budget is far
behind that of the US and China, which stand at \$643bn and \$168bn
respectively. [Moscow]{.underline} has become better at fighting limited
wars such as those in Ukraine and Syria but [is not in a position to
project military power globally.]{.underline} Despite its relatively
close ties to China and India, [Russia cannot rely on a stable network
of alliances similar to the ones the US enjoys in Europe, East Asia and
beyond]{.underline}. [In short, the Russian Federation **cannot and will
not** replace the US as the leading power or hegemon in the Middle East
or any other part of the world]{.underline}. Even its dominance in
post-Soviet Eurasia is a tall order. Countries in Eastern Europe, such
as Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova are oriented economically and
politically towards the West. In Central Asia, China is becoming
increasingly the dominant centre of gravity. In a post-American world,
Russia, too, would likely end up as Beijing\'s junior partner rather
than an equal stakeholder. [The essence of Russia\'s strategy
is]{.underline}, to quote the late Russian politician Yevgeny Primakov,
[to \"play a weak hand well]{.underline}\". In some cases, this involves
exploiting an opponent\'s vulnerabilities. Polarised domestic politics
in the West have strengthened Russia\'s hand. This has allowed Putin to
play more effectively a \"divide and conquer\" game. In other cases,
Russia has benefited from being flexible. In the Middle East, for
instance, it has been successfully cooperating with all mutually
antagonistic powers: Iran, Israel, the Gulf, Turkey, the Kurds, etc.
Nonetheless, Putin\'s foreign policy record remains mixed. Sometimes his
gambles pay off, sometimes not. Russia\'s fighter jets, together with
Iran\'s ground troops, saved the Assad regime in Syria. Crimea, too, was
a coup. It sent the Russian president\'s popularity ratings at home to
80 percent or more. If Nicolas Maduro survives in Venezuela, that will
give Russia a further international boost. In Europe, oil and gas endow
Moscow with geopolitical leverage; Germany, for example, has been going
out of its way to push for the Nordstream 2 gas pipeline, to the dismay
of the US. Balkan countries, too, have been eager to host an extension
of the Turk Stream pipeline. [But]{.underline} then again, [there are
limits to Moscow\'s power. NATO is enlarging, despite pushback from
Russia]{.underline}. This year North Macedonia is set to join the
alliance, following in the footsteps of Montenegro. At the same time,
[Putin is not making much headway in Ukraine.]{.underline} The conflict
in the Donbas has long been in a state of deadlock while Kyiv is not
accepting a Russian proposal for a power-sharing constitution which
would effectively give Russia veto power over its foreign policy.
Furthermore, [international success has come at a cost. The sanctions
imposed by the EU and the US are still there]{.underline}. Despite - or
perhaps because of - Donald Trump\'s friendly overtures towards the
Kremlin, the US [Congress has been ramping up punitive measures against
Russia.]{.underline} The Mueller investigation and the alleged collusion
between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin have made a rapprochement
even more unlikely. For much of the past decade, this pursuit of
greatness abroad was paying off domestically, giving Putin legitimacy
and solidifying his grip on power. That appears to be less and less the
case, however. [Foreign exploits are no longer able to boost his
rating]{.underline}. Gains in Syria, the Central African Republic or
Venezuela are not buying the regime popularity. [Russian society is
increasingly focused on immediate challenges at home, like anaemic
growth, the projected rise of the pension age, and debilitating
corruption.]{.underline} Trust in institutions is low, with only Putin
retaining popularity as an individual. [Social discontent is on the
rise]{.underline} and the Western sanctions, in conjunction with
volatile oil prices, are adding to the pain. Certainly, [these domestic
pressures]{.underline} won\'t force the Kremlin to undertake a U-turn
and sue for peace. But they [come as a healthy reminder that the idea
that Russia is a revisionist power capable of upending the world order
and Putin is a leader endowed with superhuman abilities is a **far cry
from reality**]{.underline}.

### ! d -- no US-Russia war

#### No US-Russia war

Russian Threat? Americans Shouldn\'t Be Running Scared of Moscow,\" Cato

<https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/what-russian-threat-americans-shouldnt-be-running-scared-moscow>)

Yet the [fear-mongering is nonsense]{.underline}. Russia's presumed
attempt to influence America's election was more smoke than fire. Moscow
is accused of a private hack which released emails detailing the sleaze
afflicting one of the presidential candidates. Although illegal like
other cyber-attacks, that's pretty mild, especially compared to
Washington's routine interference in other nations' political affairs,
including their elections. Although American officials proclaim their
commitment to democracy, their activities almost always promote parties,
leaders, and movements friendly to the U.S. [More serious are claims
that Moscow poses a security threat]{.underline}. Military capabilities
are more than formal military budgets, but [the [spending disparity
between the U.S. and Russia is vast]{.mark}]{.underline}: [[Washington's
outlays]{.mark} are almost [ten times]{.mark} as much as
[Moscow]{.mark}'s.]{.underline} President Donald Trump just proposed an
annual jump in outlays, \$54 billion, which is nearly as much as Russia
will spend all year. [[Russia lacks the global reach]{.mark} [to
challenge]{.mark} [America]{.mark}. As Putin noted]{.underline} in an
interview with an Italian journalist: ["[Publish a]{.mark} world
[map]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [mark]{.mark} all the [U.S. military
bases]{.mark} on it. [You will see the difference]{.mark} between Russia
and the U.S." [Moscow also lacks]{.mark} [the economic foundation to
match the U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[According to the
I]{.underline}]{.mark}nternational [[I]{.underline}]{.mark}nstitute for
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}trategic [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tudies, ["[One
effect of]{.mark} the country's [deteriorating economic
situation]{.mark} [has been]{.mark}]{.underline} [the [delay
in]{.mark}]{.underline} concluding [the]{.underline} next
[[State]{.underline} [Armament Program]{.underline}]{.mark}; originally
intended to have been started in 2016, this has now been pushed back to
2018." [Russia possesses]{.underline} the world's second most [powerful
nuclear arsenal]{.underline}, capable of destroying America many times
over. [But [even Moscow's sharpest critics don't
believe]{.mark}]{.underline} Vladimir [[Putin plans to commit
suicide]{.underline}]{.mark}. That nuclear threat acts more as Russia's
guarantee against U.S. coercion. [[Neither side can]{.mark}
[allow]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[stakes of]{.mark} any [conflict to
race out of control]{.mark}]{.underline}. Beyond inaugurating nuclear
Armageddon, how does Moscow threaten America? [An invasion seems
unlikely]{.underline}, [since the two countries don't share a land
boundary]{.underline}. An attack across the Bering Strait to retake
Alaska is more than a little unlikely. Which means there is no direct
threat to the U.S. How about isolating America by controlling sea and
air and interdicting commerce? That's almost as implausible. The vaunted
Red Navy is gone. Moscow deploys one decrepit aircraft carrier, no match
for Washington's multiple carrier groups. And the U.S. is allied with
European nations which also possess capable if smaller fleets. Russia is
upgrading its forces, but it lacks the resources to equal America.
Moscow is no more likely to dominate the air above or around the U.S.
Russia's air force is capable and has gained valuable combat experience
over Syria, but remains no match for America's globe-spanning force.
More dangerous may be Russian air defenses, which would ensure that
hostile U.S. air operations were not the cakewalk like in Serbia, Iraq,
Afghanistan, and Libya. Nor is there any obvious reason why Moscow would
inaugurate war with the U.S. Russia's critics notwithstanding, the Cold
War is over. There is only one aggressive ideological power, and that is
America. Putinism is a simpler, practical authoritarian nationalism. The
concerted campaign by Republican hawks like Lindsey Graham and
Democratic partisans of all stripes to turn Moscow into an enemy is not
just counterproductive. It is dangerous. That's obviously not a
congenial home for anyone who believes in America's classical liberal
heritage. The vision of a limited government dedicated to protecting
individual rights has few takers in the Russian Federation. The real
problem posed by Vladimir Putin is not that he's an unpleasant thug, but
that he seems to represent a substantial number---a strong majority if
polls are to be believed---of Russians. Still, Moscow's policy reflects
much more a defensive than aggressive stance. Its role in the world
looks a lot like that of pre-1914 imperial Russia. The Putin government
wants its interests to be respected and its borders to be secure. It
especially doesn't like seeing its friends, such as Serbia, dismembered
without so much as a nod in Moscow's direction. Russia also opposes a
potentially hostile alliance pushing ever eastward, absorbing lands such
as Ukraine that once were integral to the Russian Empire as well as the
Soviet Union. The U.S. (and Moscow's neighbors) might wish that Russia
would accept America's not always so benevolent hegemony. However, Boris
Yeltsen's rule proved to be but a brief interregnum until age-old
Russian nationalism reasserted itself. That Moscow now stands up for
what it considers to be its interests is no cause for alarm in
Washington unless the latter has aggressive designs on Russia itself.
The belief that such a nation and people would voluntarily, even
enthusiastically, submit to American "leadership" always was a fantasy.
Of course, Moscow's policies sometimes run contrary to Washington's
desires, but that doesn't mean Russia poses a threat. Moscow generally
has been helpful in Afghanistan, Iran, and North Korea, all significant
concerns of the U.S. Russia has moved closer to China, despite major
differences between the two, but largely in response to Washington's
hostile policies toward both great powers. In this way the Obama
administration inadvertently reversed Richard Nixon's geopolitical
masterstroke of 45 years ago. Washington is similarly displeased with
Russia's intervention in Syria, but Damascus long has been a Russian
ally. America has no monopoly on the "right" to wage war in the Mideast.
And the U.S. nevertheless remains the region's dominant outside power,
allying with Israel and the Gulf States, maintaining multiple bases in
multiple countries throughout the region, and fighting endless wars for
years. If there is a "Russian threat" to America it must come in Europe,
generously defined to include Georgia and Ukraine. Yet the Cold War
truly is over. [There is no Red Army poised to plunge into the Fulda Gap
and race to the Atlantic Ocean]{.underline}. The very idea of Russian
domination of Eurasia is fantastic. Europe has recovered economically
from World War II and consolidated politically into the European Union.
The continent enjoys about three and a half times Russia's population
and almost 15 times its GDP. Indeed, Germany alone almost has three
times Russia's economic strength. The economies of the United Kingdom,
France, and even Italy are larger than Russia's economy. Despite their
shameless defense lassitude, [[Europeans]{.underline}]{.mark} still
[[collectively spend]{.mark} nearly [four times]{.mark} as much as
[Moscow on]{.mark} the [military]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The UK alone
comes close to Russia's levels]{.underline}. For all of the sound and
fury at recent NATO meetings, [[no one seriously contemplates a Russian
attack on]{.underline}]{.mark} "Old [[Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}," or
even most of "New Europe." [[What would Moscow gain by triggering
a]{.mark} potential [nuclear war]{.mark}]{.underline} while trying to
overrun large populations of non-Russians who would resist Moscow's
rule? Theoretical [capability does not equal intent]{.underline}. Last
year the faculty of [the [Naval War College]{.mark}]{.underline}
assessed the Russian "threat." The NWC subsequently issued a "Sense of
the [[Faculty]{.underline}]{.mark}" report which revealed that a
majority believed "Russia's fear of potentially 'hostile' forces on its
doorstep and within its historical sphere of influence" was "the most
fundamental cause of the Ukraine Crisis." Moreover[, [71 percent
considered the likelihood of an attack on the Baltics to

Washington is [treaty-bound]{.underline} to defend them, an unfortunate
result of the foolish go-go years of NATO expansion. [However, [Russian
aggression is very unlikely]{.mark}]{.underline}.

But [the biggest diplomatic achievement of the past 12 months may have
been the simple fact that Russia and the West avoided a return to a Cold
War-style confrontation]{.underline}. [Having set a collision course
with the U.S.]{.underline} and Europe [over Ukraine in
2014]{.underline}, [Moscow repeatedly courted a further deterioration in
relations]{.underline}. In January, [it unleashed a brutal
offensive]{.underline} by its proxies and covert forces [in eastern
Ukraine]{.underline}, ripping up previous cease-fire agreements in the
process. In September, [it launched its intervention in
Syria]{.underline}, whipping up confusion in Western capitals over its
intentions and, if independent reports are right, adopting a cavalier
attitude to civilian deaths. [Both of these [military gambles could have
sparked a hard-line response from Western
policymakers]{.mark}]{.underline}. In response to the January offensive
in Ukraine, U.S. officials considered plans to arm Kiev, potentially
precipitating a further escalation of the conflict. The Russian air
campaign over Syria inevitably risked an unintentional clash with the
parallel U.S.-led coalition bombing the self-declared Islamic State, a
danger that proved real when Turkey shot down a Russian jet over its
border in November. **[[Despite]{.mark} these [provocations]{.mark},
[the U.S.]{.mark} and its allies [have found ways to de-escalate
tensions with Moscow]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It even seems possible that
[the two sides will settle on a compromise over Syria that]{.underline}
diplomats hope [could lead to broader rapprochement]{.underline},
although the plunge in relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia may now
upset this. [Why did Russia's adventurism not lead to a more serious
confrontation? Three factors have been crucial: European leaders'
caution, the]{.underline} Obama [administration's fierce focus on the
Iran deal, and the threat from the Islamic State and its imitators. [The
Europeans' fear of]{.mark}]{.underline} an uncontrolled
[[escalation]{.underline}]{.mark} over Ukraine [[proved
decisive]{.underline}]{.mark} in the first quarter of the year, as
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande
hastily cobbled together a new cease-fire, the so-called Minsk II
accords, to ease the violence in Ukraine. Washington's urge to settle
the nuclear standoff with Iran shaped diplomatic calculations through
the middle of 2015, as [Russian officials made a point of being
conspicuously helpful in the final negotiations with
Tehran.]{.underline} While Moscow's Syrian campaign threatened to
torpedo relations in the last months of the year, [[the November
terrorist attacks]{.mark} in Paris [transformed Western leaders'
thinking]{.mark}]{.underline} [anew]{.underline}. [[Their priority is
now]{.mark} [maintaining stable relations with Russia as a basis for
extending operations in Syria]{.mark} against]{.underline} the
**[I]{.underline}**slamic **[S]{.underline}**tate, [while all sides seem
willing to accept a slow freezing of the conflict in eastern
Ukraine]{.underline}. As a recent survey by the European Council on
Foreign Relations (ECFR) shows, Russia and its proxies still partially
or wholly ignore many key aspects of the Minsk II bargain. Moscow has,
for example, skillfully modulated its military presence in eastern
Ukraine, deploying multiple armored brigades during the worst of the
fighting while "switching to a smaller force of trainers, special forces
and logistic personnel during calm phases." But [such cosmetic
variations help keep the crisis under control, and although the U.S. and
the European Union maintain sanctions on Moscow, everyone is more
focused on Syria.]{.underline} Critics of Western policy believe that
Russia is simply reaping undeserved rewards for its chronic adventurism.
As I noted in February, Merkel and Hollande's drive for a compromise
with Russian President Vladimir Putin over Ukraine "rehabilitated Putin
as a serious interlocutor, a status he seemed close to losing after the
breakdown of previous cease-fires." Similarly, as I argued last month in
the American Interest, the Russian president has been the beneficiary of
a "vicious cycle" over Syria: "Russia's tactics have repeatedly caused
the war to worsen; each time the situation deteriorates, Moscow steps up
to suggest that it can ease matters through the U.N., a ruse that
President Putin perfected in 2013 with his offer to defuse the chemical
weapons crisis." Moscow has, in short, learned that it can behave like
the proverbial bull in a china shop so long as it promises to help clean
up afterward. Yet it is also possible to claim that [the West has
succeeded in neutering Putin, or at least containing him, by drawing him
back into complex diplomatic negotiations each time that he goes on the
offensive]{.underline}. [Despite its apparent bellicosity, Moscow still
seems to crave the status and security that it garners from diplomatic
bargains]{.underline} such as Minsk II and the current U.N.-backed
negotiations on a Syrian cease-fire. It is arguable, too, [that Moscow's
overall military strategy would make little sense if it could not fall
back on these mechanisms: [Russia lacks the military means to run a
full-scale war]{.mark}]{.underline} in Syria indefinitely [and could not
sustain complete economic isolation from the West]{.underline} over
Ukraine. **[[It suits all parties to stay at the negotiating table
rather than ratchet up tensions further, even if]{.mark} the level of
mutual [mistrust remains]{.mark} very [high]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Some
observers believe that European and U.S. diplomats are still too easily
beguiled by the idea of "positive conversations" with Putin, while
ignoring his ultimate aims. As ECFR's Kadri Liik points out, Russia
wants to be seen as an "equal," and that means "having geopolitical veto
rights and uncritical acceptance of the nature and practices of its
domestic regime." Yet, if continued diplomacy delivers a Syrian
cease-fire and, at least, relative calm in eastern Ukraine through 2016,
[the West's strategy of tolerating Russian adventurism within certain
limits will ultimately look justifiable.]{.underline} Washington and its
allies have already gone some way to granting Moscow extra leverage in
the international system, but will not easily accede to Russia's
ambitions for even greater powers. [Relations will remain profoundly
difficult. But if Putin and his Western counterparts can find just
enough common ground]{.underline} to work together more than they fight
in 2016, [they could still make the world a marginally safer
place]{.underline}.

#### International order is [resilient]{.underline}, the U.S. isn't key\-\--it [adapts]{.underline} and [self-corrects]{.underline}

**Deudney** and Ikenberry **18** - \*Daniel Deudney, Associate Professor

Princeton University ("Liberal World: The Resilient Order," *Foreign
Affairs*, July/August 2018,

Decades after they were supposedly banished from the West, the dark
forces of world politics---[illiberalism, autocracy, nationalism,
protectionism, spheres of influence, territorial
revisionism]{.underline}---have **[reasserted themselves]{.underline}**.
[China and Russia have **dashed all hopes**]{.underline} that [they
would]{.underline} quickly transition to democracy and [support the
liberal world order]{.underline}. To the contrary, [they]{.underline}
have **[strengthened their authoritarian systems]{.underline}** at home
[and]{.underline} **[flouted norms]{.underline}** abroad. Even more
stunning, with the United Kingdom having voted for Brexit and the United
States having elected Donald Trump as president, the leading patrons of
the liberal world order have chosen to undermine their own system.
Across the world, [a new nationalist mindset has
**emerged**]{.underline}, one t[hat views international institutions and
globalization as threats to national sovereignty]{.underline} and
identity rather than opportunities. The recent rise of illiberal forces
and leaders is certainly worrisome. Yet [it is **too soon** to write the
obituary of liberalism]{.underline} as a theory of international
relations, liberal democracy as a system of government, or the liberal
order as the overarching framework for global politics. [The liberal
vision of nation-states cooperating to achieve security and prosperity
remains as vital today]{.underline} as at any time in the modern age. In
the long course of history, [liberal democracy has hit been hard times
before]{.underline}, **[only to rebound and gain ground]{.underline}**.
It has done so [thanks to the appeal of its basic values and its unique
capacities to effectively grapple with the problems of modernity and
globalization.]{.underline} For the first time in history, global
institutions are now necessary to realize basic human interests; intense
forms of interdependence that were once present only on a smaller scale
are now present on a global scale. [The order will endure]{.underline},
too. [**Even though** the United States' relative power is
waning]{.underline}, [the international system]{.underline} that the
country has sustained for seven decades **[is remarkably
durable]{.underline}**. As long as interdependence---economic,
security-related, and environmental---continues to grow, peoples and
governments everywhere will be compelled to work together to solve
problems or suffer grievous harm. By necessity, [these efforts will
build on and strengthen the institutions of the liberal
order.]{.underline} THE LIBERAL VISION Modern liberalism holds that
world politics requires new levels of political integration in response
to relentlessly rising interdependence. But political orders do not
arise spontaneously, and liberals argue that a world with more liberal
democratic capitalist states will be more peaceful, prosperous, and
respectful of human rights. It is not inevitable that history will end
with the0 triumph of liberalism, but it is inevitable that a decent
world order will be liberal. The recent rise of illiberal forces and the
apparent recession of the liberal international order may seem to call
this school of thought into question. But [despite some notable
exceptions, states still mostly interact through well-worn institutions
and in the spirit of **self-interested**, **pragmatic
accommodation**]{.underline}. Moreover, part of the reason liberalism
may look unsuited to the times is that many of its critics assail a
strawman version of the theory. [Liberals are often portrayed as having
overly optimistic]{.underline}---even utopian---[assumptions about the
path of human history]{.underline}. In reality, they have a much more
conditional and tempered optimism that recognizes tragic tradeoffs, and
they are keenly attentive to the possibilities for large-scale
catastrophes. Like realists, [they recognize]{.underline} that [it is
often human nature to seek power]{.underline}, [which is why they
advocate **constitutional** and **legal restraints**]{.underline}. But
unlike realists, who see history as cyclical, liberals are heirs to the
Enlightenment project of technological innovation, which opens new
possibilities both for human progress and for disaster. Liberalism is
essentially pragmatic. Modern liberals embrace democratic governments,
market-based economic systems, and international institutions not out of
idealism but because they believe these arrangements are better suited
to realizing human interests in the modern world than any alternatives.
Indeed, in thinking about world order, the variable that matters most
for liberal thinkers is interdependence. For the first time in history,
global institutions are now necessary to realize basic human interests;
intense forms of interdependence that were once present only on a
smaller scale are now present on a global scale. For example, [whereas
environmental problems used to be contained largely within countries or
regions, the cumulative effect of human activities on the planet's
biospheric life-support system has now been so great as to require a new
geologic name for the current time period---the
Anthropocene]{.underline}. Unlike its backward-looking nationalist and
realist rivals, [liberalism has a **pragmatic adaptability** and a
penchant for institutional innovations that are **vital for responding
to** such emerging challenges as **artificial intelligence**,
**cyberwarfare**, and **genetic engineering**.]{.underline} Overall,
[liberalism remains **perennially** and **universally appealing**
because it rests on a commitment to the dignity and freedom of
individuals]{.underline}. It enshrines the idea of tolerance, which will
be needed in spades as the world becomes increasingly interactive and
diverse. Although the ideology emerged in the West, its values have
become universal, and its champions have extended to encompass Mahatma
Gandhi, Mikhail Gorbachev, and Nelson Mandela. And even though
imperialism, slavery, and racism have marred Western history,
[liberalism has always been at the forefront of
efforts]{.underline}---both peaceful and militant---to reform and end
these practices. To the extent that the long arc of history does bend
toward justice, it does so thanks to the activism and moral commitment
of liberals and their allies. DEMOCRATIC DECLINE IN PERSPECTIVE In many
respects, [today's liberal democratic malaise is a **byproduct** of the
liberal world order's success]{.underline}. After the Cold War, that
order became a global system, expanding beyond its birthplace in the
West. But as free markets spread, problems began to crop up: economic
inequality grew, old political bargains between capital and labor broke
down, and social supports eroded. The benefits of globalization and
economic expansion were distributed disproportionately to elites.
Oligarchic power bloomed. A modulated form of capitalism morphed into
winner-take-all casino capitalism. Many new democracies turned out to
lack the traditions and habits necessary to sustain democratic
institutions. And large flows of immigrants triggered a xenophobic
backlash. Together, these developments have called into question the
legitimacy of liberal democratic life and created openings for
opportunistic demagogues. Just as the causes of this malaise are clear,
so is its solution: a return to the fundamentals of liberal democracy.
Rather than deeply challenging the first principles of liberal
democracy, the current problems call for reforms to better realize them.
To reduce inequality, political leaders will need to return to the
social democratic policies embodied in the New Deal, pass more
progressive taxation, and invest in education and infrastructure. To
foster a sense of liberal democratic identity, they will need to
emphasize education as a catalyst for assimilation and promote national
and public service. In other words, the remedy for the problems of
liberal democracy is more liberal democracy; liberalism contains the
seeds of its own salvation. Indeed, [liberal democracies have
**repeatedly recovered from crises** resulting from their own
excesses]{.underline}. In the 1930s, overproduction and the integration
of financial markets brought about an [economic depression]{.underline},
which triggered the rise of fascism. But it also [triggered the New Deal
and social democracy]{.underline}, [leading to]{.underline} a **[more
stable form of capitalism]{.underline}**. In the 1950s, the success of
the Manhattan Project, combined with the emerging [U.S.-Soviet
rivalry]{.underline}, created the novel threat of a worldwide nuclear
holocaust. That threat [gave rise to arms control pacts and agreements
concerning the governance of global spaces]{.underline}, deals forged by
the United States in collaboration with the Soviet Union. In the 1970s,
[rising middle-class consumption led to oil shortages, economic
stagnation]{.underline}, and environmental decay. In response, [the
advanced industrial democracies established oil coordination
agreements]{.underline}, [invested in clean energy, and struck numerous
international environmental accords aimed at reducing
pollutants]{.underline}. [The problems]{.underline} that liberal
democracies face today, while great, [are **certainly not more
challenging** than those that they have faced and overcome in these
historically recent decades]{.underline}. Of course, there is no
guarantee that liberal democracies will successfully rise to the
occasion, but [to count them out would **fly in the face** of **repeated
historical experiences**]{.underline}. Today's dire predictions ignore
these past successes. They suffer from a blinding presentism. Taking
what is new and threatening as the master pattern is an understandable
reflex in the face of change, but it is almost never a very good guide
to the future. [Large-scale human arrangements such as liberal democracy
rarely change as rapidly or as radically as they seem to in the
moment]{.underline}. [If history is **any guide**]{.underline}, [today's
illiberal populists and authoritarians will **evoke resistance** and
**countermovements**.]{.underline} THE RESILIENT ORDER After World War
II, liberal democracies joined together to create an international order
that reflected their shared interests. And as is the case with liberal
democracy itself, the order that emerged to accompany it cannot be
easily undone. For one thing, it is deeply embedded. Hundreds of
millions, if not billions, of people have geared their activities and
expectations to the order's institutions and incentives, from farmers to
microchip makers. However unappealing aspects of it may be, [replacing
the liberal order with something significantly different would be
**extremely difficult**]{.underline}. Despite the high expectations they
generate, [revolutionary moments **often fail** to make enduring
changes]{.underline}. [It is **unrealistic** today to think that a few
years of nationalist demagoguery will **dramatically undo liberalism**.
Growing interdependence makes the order **especially difficult to
overturn**]{.underline}. Ever since its inception in the eighteenth
century, liberalism has been deeply committed to the progressive
improvement of the human condition through scientific discovery and
technological advancements. This Enlightenment project began to bear
practical fruits on a large scale in the nineteenth century,
transforming virtually every aspect of human life. New techniques for
production, communication, transportation, and destruction poured forth.
The liberal system has been at the forefront not just of stoking those
fires of innovation but also of addressing the negative consequences.
Adam Smith's case for free trade, for example, was strengthened when it
became easier to establish supply chains across global distances. And
the age-old case for peace was vastly strengthened when weapons evolved
from being simple and limited in their destruction to the city-busting
missiles of the nuclear era. Liberal democratic capitalist societies
have thrived and expanded because they have been particularly adept at
stimulating and exploiting innovation and at coping with their spillover
effects and negative externalities. In short, liberal modernity excels
at both harvesting the fruits of modern advance and guarding against its
dangers. [This dynamic of constant change and ever-increasing
interdependence is **only accelerating**]{.underline}. [Human progress
has caused **grave harm**]{.underline} to the planet and its atmosphere,
[yet **climate change** will]{.underline} also [require unprecedented
levels of international cooperation]{.underline}. [With the rise of
**bioweapons** and **cyberwarfare**]{.underline}, [the capabilities to
wreak mass destruction are **getting cheaper**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} ever **[more accessible]{.underline}**,
[making]{.underline} the [international regulation of these technologies
a vital national security imperative for all countries]{.underline}. At
the same time, [global capitalism has drawn more people and countries
into cross-border webs of exchange]{.underline}, thus [making virtually
everyone dependent on the competent management of international finance
and trad]{.underline}e. [In the age of global interdependence, **even a
realist must be an internationalist**]{.underline}. The international
order is also likely to persist because its survival does not depend on
all of its members being liberal democracies. The return of
isolationism, the rise of illiberal regimes such as China and Russia,
and the general recession of liberal democracy in many parts of the
world appear to bode ill for the liberal international order. But
[contrary to the conventional wisdom]{.underline}, [many of its
institutions are not **uniquely liberal**]{.underline} in character.
Rather, [they are Westphalian]{.underline}, in that they are [designed
merely to solve problems of sovereign states]{.underline}, whether they
be democratic or authoritarian. [And many of the key participants in
these institutions are **anything but liberal or
democratic**]{.underline}. Consider the Soviet Union's cooperative
efforts during the Cold War. Back then, the liberal world order was
primarily an arrangement among liberal democracies in Europe, North
America, and East Asia. Even so, [the Soviet Union often worked with the
democracies to help build international institutions]{.underline}.
[Moscow's committed antiliberal stance **did not stop it** from
partnering with Washington to create a raft of arms control
agreements]{.underline}. Nor did it stop it from cooperating with
Washington through the World Health Organization to spearhead a global
campaign to eradicate smallpox, which succeeded in completely
eliminating the disease by 1979. More recently, [countries of all
stripes have crafted **global rules** to guard against environmental
destruction]{.underline}. The signatories to the [Paris]{.underline}
climate agreement, for example, [include]{.underline} such [autocracies
as China, Iran, and Russia]{.underline}. Westphalian approaches have
also thrived when it comes to governing the commons, such as the ocean,
the atmosphere, outer space, and Antarctica. To name just one example,
the 1987 [Montreal Protocol]{.underline}, which has
[thwarted]{.underline} the [destruction of the ozone]{.underline} layer,
has been actively supported by democracies and dictatorships alike. Such
agreements are not challenges to the sovereignty of the states that
create them but collective measures to solve problems they cannot
address on their own. Most [institutions in the liberal order **do not
demand**]{.underline} that their [backers be liberal
democracies]{.underline}; [they only require that they be status quo
powers and capable of fulfilling their commitments]{.underline}. They do
not challenge the Westphalian system; they codify it. The UN, for
example, enshrines the principle of state sovereignty and, through the
permanent members of the Security Council, the notion of great-power
decision-making. All of this makes the order more durable. Because [much
of international cooperation has nothing at all to do with liberalism or
democrac]{.underline}y, when politicians who are hostile to all things
liberal are in power, they can still retain their international agendas
and keep the order alive. The [**persistence** of Westphalian
institutions provides a **lasting foundation** on which distinctively
liberal and democratic institutions can be **erected in the
future**.]{.underline} Another reason to believe that the liberal order
will endure involves the return of ideological rivalry. [The **last two
and a half decades** have been profoundly anomalous in that liberalism
has had **no credible competitor**]{.underline}. During the rest of its
existence, [it faced competition that made it stronger]{.underline}.
Throughout the nineteenth century, liberal democracies sought to
outperform monarchical, hereditary, and aristocratic regimes. During the
first half of the twentieth century, [autocratic and fascist competitors
created **strong incentives** for the liberal democracies to get their
own houses in order and band together]{.underline}. And after World War
II, they built the liberal order in part to contain the threat of the
Soviet Union and international communism. [The C]{.underline}hinese
[C]{.underline}ommunist [P]{.underline}arty appears increasingly likely
to seek to offer an alternative to the components of the existing order
that have to do with economic liberalism and human rights. [If it ends
up competing with the liberal democracies]{.underline}, [they
will]{.underline} again **[face pressure]{.underline}** [to **champion
their values**]{.underline}. [As during the Cold War, they will have
incentives to **undertake domestic reforms** and **strengthen their
international alliances**]{.underline}. The collapse of the Soviet
Union, although a great milestone in the annals of the advance of
liberal democracy, had the ironic effect of eliminating one of its main
drivers of solidarity. [The bad news of renewed ideological rivalry
could be **good news** for the liberal international order]{.underline}.
CORE MELTDOWN In challenging the U.S. commitment to NATO and the trading
rules of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the World
Trade Organization, Trump has called into question the United States'
traditional role as the leader of the liberal order. And with the vote
to leave the EU, the United Kingdom has launched itself into the
uncharted seas of a full withdrawal from Europe's most prized postwar
institution. In an unprecedented move, the Anglo-American core of the
liberal order appears to have fully reversed course. Despite what the
backers of Trump and Brexit promise, actually effecting a real
withdrawal from these long-standing commitments will be difficult to
accomplish. That's because the [institutions of the liberal
international orde]{.underline}r, although often treated as ephemeral
and fragile, [are]{.underline} actually **[quite
resilient]{.underline}**. They did not emerge by accident; [they were
the **product of deeply held interests**]{.underline}. Over the decades,
the activities and interests of countless actors---corporations, civic
groups, and government bureaucracies---have become intricately entangled
in these institutions. Severing those institutional ties sounds simple,
but in practice, it is devilishly complicated. The difficulties have
already become abundantly clear with Brexit. It is not so easy, it turns
out, to undo in one fell swoop a set of institutional arrangements that
were developed over five decades and that touch on virtually every
aspect of British life and government. Divorcing the EU means scrapping
solutions to real problems, problems that haven't gone away. In Northern
Ireland, for example, negotiators in the 1990s found an elegant solution
to the long-running conflict there by allowing the region to remain part
of the United Kingdom but insisting that there be no border controls
between it and the Republic of Ireland---a bargain that leaving the EU's
single market and customs union would undo. If officials do manage to
fully implement Brexit, it seems an inescapable conclusion that the
United Kingdom's economic output and influence in the world will fall.
Likewise, the initial efforts by the Trump administration to
unilaterally alter the terms of trade with China and renegotiate NAFTA
with Canada and Mexico have revealed how intertwined these countries'
economies are with the U.S. economy. New international linkages of
production and trade have clearly produced losers, but they have also
produced many winners who have a vested interest in maintaining the
status quo. Farmers and manufacturers, for instance, have reaped massive
gains from NAFTA and have lobbied hard for Trump to keep the agreement
intact, making it politically difficult for him to pull off an outright
withdrawal. The incentives for Washington to stay in international
security institutions are even greater. Abandoning NATO, as candidate
Trump suggested the United States should do, would massively disrupt a
security order that has provided seven decades of peace on a
historically war-torn continent---and doing so at a time when Russia is
resurgent would be all the more dangerous. The interests of the United
States are so obviously well served by the existing security order that
any American administration would be compelled to sustain them. Indeed,
in lieu of withdrawing from NATO, Trump, as president, has shifted his
focus to the time-honored American tradition of trying to get the
Europeans to increase their defense spending to bear more of the burden.
Similarly, major pieces of the nuclear arms control architecture from
the end of the Cold War are unraveling and expiring. Unless American
diplomatic leadership is forthcoming, the world may find itself thrown
back into a largely unregulated nuclear arms race. The Trump
administration's initiatives on trade and alliance politics have
generated a great deal of anxiety and uncertainty, but their actual
effect is less threatening---more a revisiting of bargains than a
pulling down of the order itself. Setting aside Trump's threats of
complete withdrawal and his chaotic and impulsive style, his
renegotiations of trade deals and security alliances can be seen as part
an ongoing and necessary, if sometimes ugly, equilibration of the
arrangements underlying the institutions of the liberal world order. On
the issues that matter most, Trump's foreign policy, despite its
"America first" rhetoric and chaotic implementation, continues to move
along the tracks of the American-built order. Moreover, despite Trump's
relentless demeaning of the international order, he has sometimes acted
in ways that fulfill, rather than challenge, the traditional American
role in it. His most remarkable use of force so far has been to bomb
Syria for its egregious violations of international norms against the
use of chemical weapons on civilians. His policy toward Russia, while
convoluted and compromised, has essentially been a continuation of that
pursued by the George W. Bush and Obama administrations: sanctioning
Russia for its revisionism in eastern Europe and cyberspace. Perhaps
most important, Trump's focus on China as a great-power rival will
compel him or some future administration to refurbish and expand U.S.
alliances rather than withdraw from them. On the issues that matter
most, Trump's foreign policy, despite its "America first" rhetoric and
chaotic implementation, continues to move along the tracks of the
American-built order. In other areas, of course, Trump really is
undermining the liberal order. But [as the United States has stepped
back, **others have stepped forward**]{.underline} to sustain the
project. In a speech before the U.S. Congress in April, French President
Emmanuel Macron spoke for many U.S. allies when he called on the
international community to "step up our game and build the
twenty-first-century world order, based on the perennial principles we
established together after World War II." [Many allies are already doing
just that]{.underline}. Even though Trump withdrew the United States
from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade deal lives on, with the 11
other member states implementing their own version of the pact.
Similarly, Trump's withdrawal from the Paris agreement has not stopped
dozens of other countries from working to implement its ambitious goals.
Nor is it preventing many U.S. states, cities, companies, and
individuals from undertaking their own efforts. [The liberal order may
be losing its chief patron, but it **rests on much more than leadership
from the Oval Office**]{.underline}. [**THE LONG VIEW** It is easy to
view developments over the last few years as a rebuke to the theory of
liberalism]{.underline} and as a sign of the eclipse of liberal
democracies and their international order. But **[that would be a
mistake]{.underline}**. Although the recent challenges should not be
underestimated, it is important to recognize that [they are closer to
the rule than the exception]{.underline}. Against the baseline of the
1990s, when the end of the Cold War seemed to signal the permanent
triumph of liberal democracy and the "end of history," the recent
setbacks and uncertainties look insurmountable. [In the larger sweep of
history]{.underline}, however, [Brexit, Trump, and the new nationalism
**do not seem so unprecedented or perilous**]{.underline}. [The liberal
democracies have survived and flourished in the face of far greater
challenges]{.underline}---[the Great Depression, the Axis powers, and
the international communist movement]{.underline}. [There is **every
reason** to believe **they can outlive this one**.]{.underline}

### ! t/ - domestic instability

#### Expanded arms sales are key to Russian economic and political stability

**Denisenetsev 17** -- Visiting Fellow @ CSIS (Sergey, "Russia in the
Global Arms Market," CSIS,
https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/170816_Denisentsev_RussiaGlobalArmsMarket_Web.pdf?VHDgCY.h54QWJm1lPCa2w1Lc.BjElJH)//BB

Furthermore, [arms exports are an **important**]{.underline} indirect
[**factor** contributing to **domestic stability**]{.underline}. [This
is because]{.underline}, according to the Russian Ministry of Industry
and Trade, [the defense industry employs more than 1.3 million
people]{.underline}. 7 Since [exports account for]{.underline} about a
third of Russia\'s defense output (more on that in the \"Other factors
of stagnation\" section), [the livelihood of roughly 400,000 Russian
engineers, scientists, and technicians, as well as members of their
families]{.underline}, directly depends on defense exports. As a rule,
[these people form a conservative and patriotically minded electorate
that is staunchly loyal to the Putin administration]{.underline}. As an
election strategy, the Russian president and his United Russia party
indirectly support this electorate through arms export stimulus packages
(credit financing, government-issued guarantees, etc.). [Russian arms
exports]{.underline} and defense relations with other countries [also
serve as important propaganda instruments]{.underline}. Russia\'s
state-owned and pro-government media outlets offer regular and generous
coverage of the latest achievements of Russian defense suppliers in
foreign markets. Such achievements include large contracts signed with
foreign customers and participation of Russian companies in
international arms expos. [The rapid growth of Russian defense
exports]{.underline} in the 2000s [is highlighted as a major achievement
of the Putin era]{.underline}. 8 The media often emphasize the personal
role played in that success story by President Putin himself and by
Sergey Chemezov, head of Rostec (the parent company of the Russian arms
export intermediary Rosoboronexport), who has been a close friend of
Putin since the latter\'s days as a Soviet agent in East Germany.9
[Until recently, the upbeat picture painted by Russian propaganda was
backed by figures]{.underline}. For example, during the Putin
presidency, Russian arms exports skyrocketed by 440 percent, from \$3.4
billion in 1999 (when Vladimir Putin became acting prime minister) to a
peak of \$15.7 billion in 2013.10 In recent years,
[however]{.underline}, that [growth has slowed and then stalled
completely]{.underline}. The focus of this paper is on the current
dynamics of Russian arms exports, the reasons for their steady growth in
the 2000s and early 2010s, their current stagnation, and the outlook for
the coming years.

[Russia's alleged threat to American interests is exaggerated, taken
well out of context by those that would benefit from sustained American
defense spending]{.underline}, and only applicable as it relates to
NATO's expansion in the Baltic States. [The **only real Russian threat**
to American interests is if it should collapse]{.underline}. If you
could not find Abkhazia, South Ossetia, the Donets Basin, Transnistria
or Crimea on a map until Russia intervened, then you've understood the
relevance a Russian challenge represents. Judging by the absence of any
meaningful international response to Russia's incursions, you would also
be in good company. [The regions in which Russia chooses to intervene
militarily simply do not matter to America, or the world]{.underline}.
[This is not because Russia does not have interests in more relevant
areas; it is because Russia **simply cannot** intervene anywhere
else]{.underline}. **[Russia has no reach]{.underline}**. Statistically
Russia possesses the strongest military that can influence Europe, but
strength is relative. Russia is strong because Europe is weak. Europe
has abused America's security spending for decades and has ended up with
papier-mâché militaries that require American leadership and supervision
to work together. European security cooperation is often limited to cost
sharing measures rather than substantial increases to defense
capabilities. Viewed simplistically against such an adversary, Russia's
relative military advantage is formidable, but reversible should Europe
get serious about its own defense. [Russia is at a stalemate against an
arguably inferior military in the Ukraine, and is logistically
constrained to operations in the Donets Basin]{.underline}, close to its
border and overwhelmingly populated by ethnic Russians. The Donets
Basin, and Russia's other adventures in the Crimea, Abkhazia, and South
Ossetia have turned those areas into economic disaster zones that
consume Russian resources and provide little in return. [This hardly
represents the reach or strategic acumen of an American near-peer
competitor]{.underline}. However, [in the context of vital interests,
our Article V commitments to the Baltic 3]{.underline} (Estonia, Latvia
and Lithuania) [represent the only existential, **albeit highly
unlikely**, intersection of competing Russian-American
interests]{.underline}. To America's and Europe's detriment, the Baltic
3 (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) became full-fledged members of NATO in
2004. In return for their numerically insignificant contributions, they
represent NATO's most vulnerable, most feasible targets for Russian
military aggression. [As recent models demonstrate, the Baltic three
would be no match for a concerted Russian assault]{.underline}. Assuming
the model accounted for the mobilization of the tens of thousands of
reservists to compliment the combined 30,000 active Latvian, Lithuanian
and Estonian servicemen and women, predictions are that Russia could
conquer the region in the course of a long weekend. Simulations also
rightly highlighted the absence of armored NATO forces to counter
Russia's strength in that area. Further problems for NATO emerge due to
the sophistication of Russian air defense capabilities. Lastly, and most
alarmingly, the study reminded analysts of the post-USSR change in
Russian nuclear doctrine, now referred to as 'de-escalation', in which
tactical nuclear weapons may be used to respond to a successful NATO
ground assault. However, [the model assumes a hypothetical environment
that places the possibility of such an event into the **realm of the
absurd**]{.underline}. Russia's overwhelming domestic social and
economic challenges suggest that [Russia is **far more likely to
collapse** than it is to take over three nations]{.underline} with an
economic output and population dwarfed by New Jersey\[i\]. Furthermore,
[for all its bluster, the least beneficial circumstance for Russia would
be a war with the world]{.underline}. Western exclusion from the group
of eight (now seven), western sanctions and sagging fuel prices have
been sufficiently crippling. Further indicators that Russia is
relatively unconcerned by security challenges from the Baltic, is that
it has made a clear prioritization of resources to its southern military
district. It is evidently more concerned over jihadist terrorism in the
Caucuses and support for breakaway regions such as Abkhazia, South
Ossetia and the Crimea, than it is in diminishing U.S. influence in the
Baltics. Some analysts point to Russia's operations in Syria as an
example of expanded capabilities. While true, it is still too early to
judge how strategically relevant those capabilities are. Russia's
ability to turn aircraft to execute sorties and launch somewhat precise
cruise missile strikes certainly bear watching and assessing, however,
these operations are relatively simple. They exist in a permissive
environment absent an anti-aircraft threat, and sidestep the complexity
of combined arms land based maneuver and their corresponding sustainment
requirements. Sustaining operations in Syria also required extraordinary
logistical measures, particularly in shipping. Operating airfields as a
guest of a host nation is an apples to oranges comparison to opening a
theater and conducting prolonged ground combat in hostile territory.
[The beneficiaries of an aggressive American foreign policy towards
Russia are manipulating the relevance of the threat it
poses]{.underline}. Unsurprisingly, [they consist of]{.underline} our
allies and our own [parochial strategic thinkers]{.underline}. Europe
(Germany in particular) is still smarting from the departure of almost a
quarter million Americans and their families since 1990. Russia's
existence and their inability to address military problems in their own
back yards (think Bosnia, Kosovo and the Ukraine) are unpleasant
reminders that eventually they may have to spend some of their own money
on their militaries. Nations like Poland and the Czech Republic bear
deep reciprocating, historical scars of occupation, and expended
substantial diplomatic capital to host the American missile defense
system that President Obama scrapped. Both would appreciate the domestic
assurance, and of course financial boon, of hosting thousands of
well-subsidized Americans and their families. [Professional American
Analysts and Strategists include clans of former Euro-warriors for whom
Russia will always be the adversary]{.underline}, and whose hard work
helped construct the international coalitions that proved vital to our
operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. This bloc makes legitimate arguments
about the trust building and interoperability that can only forward
stationed forces can achieve. This argument assumes Europe will have the
stomach and means to join us in another non-article V adventure like
Iraq or Afghanistan. Europe's armies are shrinking in both size and
capability, as is the political will to support such a campaign.
Russia's military deficiencies are unlikely to improve. Assuming the
improbable conditions under which Russia's flagging economy and ageing
population will support planned military reforms, none of Russia's
initiatives really change the situation. Rather than address the
capability gap between its ground combat units and their sustaining
organizations, Russia chose to prioritize improvements such as ICBM
delivery, ballistic missile submarines, and sea-based air defense. In
effect, it has chosen to ignore the problems that limit its strategic
reach in favor of systems that would deter American and Chinese
challenges and intimidate European populations. An understanding of
Russia's broad ambitions is not hard to assess. Russia is hardly an
inscrutable actor playing its cards close to the chest. It is a loud and
boisterous bully whose activities are largely constrained to its home
turf, and whose approach to its neighbors generates derision and scorn
as often as it does awe. As described by Eugene Rumer of the Carnegie
Endowment, Russia is a "security manager in a zone of privileged
interest". Russia still represents a strategic challenge. Through their
operations in The Ukraine and Syria, the Russians will inevitably gain
capacity in asymmetric warfare, and air-ground operations. They already
possess sophisticated cyber-warfare capabilities. Conversely, absent a
concerted Russian effort to enhance long-range sustainment of ground
forces, and a dramatic improvement in Russia's population growth and
economy, Russia will remain an interesting but marginally relevant
challenge to American interests. [Russia has no interest in investing
itself in a large war]{.underline}, when proxy wars will do. [It can
challenge American interests only at great cost to itself]{.underline}
and only under exceptional circumstances. [Viewed in context of its
capabilities, constraints and interests, Russia does not constitute a
significant]{.underline} enough [threat]{.underline} to justify the
reapportionment of America's increasingly limited military force
structure.

[Armaments exports play an **important role** in the Russian
economy]{.underline}. [They account for a]{.underline} small but
significant share of total exports, and for a [substantial share of
manufactured exports]{.underline}. This makes the industry one of the
leading sectors through which Russia is integrated with the global
economy. [Arms exports continue to play an important role in providing
demand for goods and services produced by the defence-industrial complex
in Russia]{.underline}. [Exports]{.underline} are not as important to
the defence-industrial complex as they were in the 1990s, but they
continue to help [keep production lines in service, and thus help
preserve the **full spectrum** of defence-industrial production
capabilities]{.underline}.86 [This might become even more important in
the future if, as planned, defence expenditure is further reduced from
its current elevated level]{.underline}.87 If the scheduled reduction in
spending is indeed sustained, [international arms sales would help

#### The US doesn't solve HR or secondary sales \-\-- [no enforcement]{.underline}

**Hill 17** -- writer and researcher based in the Middle East (Evan,

[Supporters of these sales argue that while these governments may be
ugly, if they don't buy from us, they will buy from the
Russians]{.underline} or the Chinese (or the French), [and selling them
our weapons gives us greater say in how those weapons are
used,]{.underline} and greater insight into how their militaries
operate. If war breaks out, we'll be able to work closely with our
clients because they'll be using our technology. Andrew Exum, a former
deputy assistant secretary of defense for Middle East policy in the
Obama administration, recently argued in this magazine that progressive
politicians should take more credit, not less, for these sales, given
the hundreds of thousands of workers employed in the U.S. defense
industry and the "millions of American mouths" fed by their salaries.
"This might be another area in which progressive elites ... are simply
out of touch with the voters they need to win back control of the
Congress and state assemblies, never mind the presidency," Exum wrote.
But arms sales don't bring home the jobs that supposedly make these
deals worth the angst. The Costs of War project at Brown University's
Watson Institute of International and Public Affairs has found that
"clean energy and health care spending create 50 percent more jobs than
the equivalent amount of spending on the military," while education
spending creates more than twice as many jobs. Boeing's deal to sell 30
passenger jets to Iran will reportedly support 18,000 U.S. jobs, the
same number Lockheed Martin touted for the air and missile defense
systems, combat ships, and tactical aircraft it may sell to Saudi
Arabia. But passenger jets won't be bombing civilians in Yemen. Nor were
Boeing, Raytheon, or Lockheed Martin even willing to hazard a guess as
to the number of jobs Trump's Riyadh proposals might actually create,
when asked by The Washington Post. [In Egypt's case, the provision of
U.S. arms has also not provided the more cynical benefits put forward by
the proponents of such sales. U.S. officials don't]{.underline} always
[know how the Egyptian military uses U.S. weapons]{.underline} in the
Sinai. In a leaked video that appeared in April, Egyptian army and
militia forces appeared to have used U.S. Humvees to transport several
Sinai men to their summary executions. More importantly, treating values
as negotiable based on whether they are effective is a slippery slope.
(The argument against torture as both reprehensible and ineffective, for
instance, raises the question of how we would view torture if it
worked.) Weapons sales to abusive governments tweak our conscience,
supporters argue, but they offer benefits. Thou shall not kill, except
for votes in swing states. In theory, U.S. law came down in favor of
values more than half a century ago, when Congress passed the Foreign
Assistance Act in the first year of the Kennedy administration, banning
security assistance to any government that "engages in a consistent
pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights."
U.S. security assistance, Congress wrote at the time, should be provided
in a way that promotes human rights and avoids identifying the United
States with abusive governments. Fifteen years later, the Arms Control
Export Act set up elaborate procedures to regulate U.S. government and
commercial arms sales and stated that the purpose of such sales should
be limited to essentially three areas: supporting friendly nations'
internal security, legitimate self-defense, or participation in United
Nations-sanctioned actions. The last major piece of legislation, passed
20 years ago by Democratic Senator Patrick [Leahy]{.underline} as an
amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act, [forbids]{.underline} the
United States from training or [equipping any unit of a foreign security
force if there is "credible evidence" that the unit has committed "gross
violations of human rights]{.underline}." **[But this regime of
rights-based restrictions has failed miserably to prevent U.S. weapons
from flowing to abusive governments]{.underline}**, especially in the
lax environment of the seemingly never-ending conflict against al-Qaeda,
the Islamic State, and whatever progeny will take their place. Michael
Newton, a retired Army officer and professor at the Vanderbilt
University School of Law, recently wrote a persuasive argument for the
American Bar Association's Center for Human Rights that arms sales to
Saudi Arabia, based on that country's various abuses both domestic and
international, violate the conditions of the Foreign Assistance Act and
Arms Control Export Act. "Saudi Arabia presents an apparent prima facie
case for the immediate cessation of sales under the FAA," Newton wrote.
Even the Leahy Law, which theoretically enables the State Department to
ban aid to abusive units based on even circumstantial evidence of
violations, is riddled with holes. [A 2016 report]{.underline} on
military aid to Egypt by the Government Accountability Office [found
that the State Department was failing to record human-rights abuses
committed by Egyptian security forces in its internal database, did not
have the organizational charts necessary to identify problematic
Egyptian units and, predictably, could not track some types of aid, like
ammunition, to their final unit]{.underline}. [In practice, the Bureau
of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, which has lead responsibility for
vetting under the Leahy Law, barely has the manpower to sift through the
billions of dollars of arms purchases]{.underline} supported by U.S.
subsidies in the form of foreign military financing, [leaving foreign
military sales---the exponentially larger purchases countries make with
their own cash---almost **unsupervised**]{.underline}.
