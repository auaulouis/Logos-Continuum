**[A postmodern approach to cross-strait relations seeks to locate sites
of disruption where discourses that emphasise territorial integrity and
political sovereignty are laid open to ambiguity and
uncertainty]{.underline}**. The point is to isolate those ongoing
discussions and disagreements over the composition of national identity,
history, and political and cultural legitimacy, in order to expose the
contingency of all national, territorial security discourses. It is in
the exposure of those contingencies that change becomes possible.
Zero-Sum Interests and the Realist State Granting that postmodernism is
seeking out the sources for radical change in and of the Westphalian
sovereign system, how else are sources for rescripting to become
translated into change in the ChineseTaiwanese relationship except via
the nations of China and Taiwan, their respective states, and the
strategic relationship they share with the US? **[Doesn't the Taiwanese
state also protect identity difference from Chinese
repression?]{.underline}** **[Collective identities may be
socially-constructed, but their content can still be
zero-sum]{.underline}**. **[What would it have meant for the individuals
of Taiwan in the 1970s to have refused the national, territorial
security discourses of realism and to have embraced identity tolerance
with China instead?]{.underline}** Certainly the latter could only have
been achieved by embracing China on its own terms, and so **[it would
have involved the political and economic subjugation of the Taiwanese
people to Beijing.]{.underline}** The vast majority of Taiwanese were
already victims of identity intolerance at the hands of the Nationalist
KMT, but they were neither Mandarinspeaking, nor did they identify with
the Chinese mainland. Although the KMT were initially welcomed by the
Taiwanese population as liberators from the Japanese occupation, Soong
notes that 'the expectation that Taiwanese could now share power with
their "mainland brothers" was crushed by the KMT'.54 Clashes and civil
unrest ensued over KMT authoritarianism, corruption, and favoritism, and
in 1947 the KMT declared martial law. The formation of political parties
was banned, the military was given considerable legal and censorship
powers, thousands of opponents were executed, and for the next
thirty-five years Taiwan became a virtual police state dominated by
Mainlanders who insisted that Mandarin be the official language. While
the KMT remained obsessed with returning to mainland China, it was not a
goal shared by many Taiwanese. Those who dreamt of Taiwanese
independence from China developed underground or overseas movements that
later evolved into the DPP. **[There was little desire among the
majority of Taiwanese to embrace identity tolerance with China on the
latter's terms]{.underline}**. **[Simultaneously, there was the
possibility of greater participation in the political institutions of
Taiwan itself.]{.underline}** **[For the Taiwanese, at that moment, to
have refused the national, territorial security discourses of IR in
favor of ambiguity and tolerance would have been to refuse the very
identity and goals that distinguished them from the KMT and mainland
Chinese]{.underline}** (**[and for which many of them had
suffered]{.underline}**). It would have meant a refusal of themselves,
which hardly seems likely or even desirable. As Elshtain puts it, 'we
are dealing with identities, remember, not easily sloughed off external
garments'.55 To say that if the Taiwanese stop thinking of China as a
problem then tensions will dissolve is true in an abstract sense but not
in any practical sense for the vast majority of people who live these
identities. **[It was the Taiwanese desire to embrace statehood and the
parameters of the Westphalian system that, along with US strategic
deterrence, prevented a Chinese invasion of Taiwan]{.underline}**. **[To
argue that the individuals of Taiwan would be safer if they refused
statehood is to ignore the Chinese commitment since 1949 to subjugate
Taiwan according to its own identity parameters]{.underline}**. **[It is
also to ignore the desire of the vast majority of Taiwanese not to be
subjugated]{.underline}** according to those parameters. **[The ROC
would not even exist if it had not been for classic balance-of-power
politics between two nation-states, the US and China, in the context of
the early Cold War]{.underline}**. **[Its evolution into a democracy is
just as indebted to its relationship with the US]{.underline}**, since
it was the US decision to improve its relations with China in the 1970s
that forced the KMT to pursue democratisation as means of national
consciousness. Simultaneously, **[the goal of Taiwanese nation-state
building was to confirm for other nation-states that the ROC had a
legitimate claim to sovereignty]{.underline}** (in opposition to China's
claim that it is only a province), because the ROC government has the
legitimate support of its population. Hence **[the increasing identity
tolerance between Taiwan and China has only been realised through the
avenues and mechanisms of national identity politics and the governing
institutions of China and Taiwan, no outside or beyond
them]{.underline}**. Certainly nations have the option of refusing to
become nation-states, but it would make little sense for nations and the
individuals who comprise them to do so, when those parameters promise
control over a specified territory via intra-national decision-making
institutions. This is why civil wars are endemic to the Westphalian
systerm and why nations will pursue statehood even when they are, in
reIative terms, politically and economically comfortable, **[If we don't
examine particular, historical contexts, identities, and institutions -
that is, if we insist upon, in Morgenthaus words, the \`neglect of the
contingencies of history and of the concreteness of history and of the
concreteness of historical situations -- then we will miss the way in
which radical ideas work through and shape existing institutions and
practices, and are in turn shaped by them]{.underline}**. Thus we will
miss the most essential link between that which changes (namely,
history), and what remains the same (namely. structure).

It is precisely the equation between the state and order that leads
realism, in turn, to question the possibility of such a
de-territorialised posimodern ethics. The postmodern notion of
self-making in a register of freedom\' suggests that individuals can and
want to be free to remake their identity but that they are prevented
from doing so by the state. The problem with such a formulation from a
realist perspective is that individuals do not want freedom from settled
identity; and in any case it is the nation, not the state, that is the
chief oppressor in this regard. Human beings are social creatures whose
humanity is only realisable within the context of a group, and, as a
result, **[human beings]{.underline}** do not embrace identity
ambiguity.3\~ They will **[form groups even when there is no rational
reason to do so]{.underline}**, and group formation means the
demarcation of identity difference from other human beings. **[What
binds a collective of individuals is always the opposition to something
normatively different]{.underline}**, external, and less desirable,
because without this juxtaposition the members of a collective cannot
know who they are and they cannot function as a collective. The need for
order and stability is \`lot a function of the state, then, it is a
function of human sociability that derives, in turn, from the anarchic
conditions of species evolution, Postmodernism is correct to argue that
the act of identity-settling is never complete and the content of
identity contestdble. This is what allows for identity manipulation,
imposition, and subjugation in the name of a greater collective good.
But realism counter-proposes that **[the human need for a settled
identity is stronger than the desire for con- tesability,]{.underline}**
and the voices offering ambiguity and contingency cannot prevail against
those offering clarity of identity difference instead. In contemporary
world politics **[the most pertinent group identity is the
nation]{.underline}**, which subsumes other forms of group identity and
is married to the state as a type of social institution and process for
determining intra- group resource decisions.\~ Individual **[identity is
intimately linked to the state as the primary decision-making structure
for the national collec- tive. A refusal to engage in
this]{.underline}** link analvtically **[means an analytical failure to
recognise how important the state remains for intra-national quarrels
over identity and resource allocation. And to encourage the identity
ambiguity while refusing engagement with the state is to play into the
hands of the forces that post-modernists wish to counter-act: the
builders of territorially-defined nation-states]{.underline}**. It is no
accident, then, that the ROC\'s development into a full- fledged
**[democracy gave pro-independence forces]{.underline}** access to the
Taiwanese state and the **[opportunity to enact policies that encourage
nationalist identity difference]{.underline}**, Early pro-independence
movements were as much about secession from China as they were
opposition to the KMT\'s authoritarian rule over Taiwan between 1949 and
1989, and there was an ethnic link between China and the KMT that was in
opposition to the island\'s Taiwanese majority. **[For many Taiwanese,
they belong to a separate nation that has no more enduring connections
to China]{.underline}** than it does to Japan or even the Netherlands,
its former colonial rulers.h1 This has proven to be electorallv
significant, and the DPP candidate, Chen Shui-bien, won the Presidency
in 2000 and 2004 on a party platform that aligns pro-independence with
Taiwanese ethnicity Taiwanese ethnic identity\' began enjoying a
tailwind of popular support during Chen\'s first term, and the 2004
Presidential election was cast \`as a choice between subjugation to
Communist China and Taiwanese nalionalism.4 Conversely, **[the political
identity of the Taiwanese Nationalists]{.underline}** **[is rife with
ambiguity which works to the political advantage of the
DPP]{.underline}** voting margins from the last two Presidential
elections, to which Chen won by thirty-nine percent and fifty percent,
suggest to electoraI strate- gists that the Nationalists will need to
embrace native Taiwanese nation- alism, and downplay their Mandarin
Chinese ethnic identities, if they wish to prevail electorally.
Meanwhile, Chen and **[the DPP show every sign of pursuing the
nation-state building agenda of]{.underline}** their campaign, which
includes revising the Taiwanese constitution, restructuring its
government, redefining Taiwan\'s territory, and **[changing the ROC\'s
name to the Republic of Taiwan]{.underline}**. According to Van Xuetong,
a foreign policy expert at Beijing\'s Quingha University Chen is
determined to be the founding father of a new nation by 20O8;
**[something which China has vowed to prevent with force if
necessary]{.underline}**. Competitive elections over control of the
state are a driving force in the upsurge in Taiwanese nationalism,
because **[the state]{.underline}** remains the primary resource
allocating institution of contemporary global politics. Hence access to
and control over it ensures the ability to pursue and obtain specified
preferences and agendas, and so it **[is a site where stuggles over
resource control and identity differentiation come together. Failure to
examine the political and national struggles over state control that
occur on a daily basis around the globe, and a preference for the study
of the rnarginalised and ambiguous instead, will get us no closer to
understanding or realising individual identity]{.underline}** or
security; **[either globally or in the Chinese-Taiwanese relationship

Both realism and postmodernism have a problematic relationship with
their conceptualizations of power and its implication in the
possibibilities for structural stasis and historical change. For
neoclassic realism, there is no other way to understand contemporary
global politics except through the institutions and mechanisms that
national groups continue to rely upon to make resource allocation
decisions. Those who control such institutions will have at their
disposal material resources (such as weapons or currency reserves) and
ideational resources (such as the moral legitimacy to ask individuals to
die on behalf of group survival. These can be utilised to pursue
particular agendas and interests those pursuits involve choices both
within and between national groups over who will be allocated what.
Small wonder then, that **[the state remains the primary site of
struggle in world politics]{.underline}** according to realism, since to
those who control the group mechanisms of resource. allocation go the
spoils. Conversely, **[postmodern attempts]{.underline}** **[to
understand global politics inevitably devolve into a study of
conflicts]{.underline}** from within their local, con- tingent and
historicised locations, because postmodernists operate on the assumption
that there is no universal rationality that Can uniformly comprehend and
evaluate the entirety of global politics. However, the power to elude,
resist, or alter realist representational practices of power politics is
always already present within the emergent moment of thought and action.
What else then can postmodemism rety upon except anecdotal instances of
individual/collective acts of resistance and trans- gression to
illustrate the emergence of new forms of international sub- jectivity?
There is no one mode of being or form of subjectivity that can be
deployed as a measure of teleological progression. There is no one
conception of freedom that can be relied upon to evaluate expressions of
self-making. There is no final arbiter, no final measure upon which
determinations of success can come to rest. It is also interesting to
observe that **[there is something eerily sim- ilar in the conclusions
of realism and postmodernism]{.underline}** juxtaposed here. The realist
position cautions us to took at the particulars of historical structure,
while the postmoderrt position draws our attention to the necessity of
thinking more expansively about the structure of historical possibility.
Thus, in our dialogue, the realist and the postmodernist have traded
places; shifting the analytical divide so that in order to understand
stasis and change, the realist insists we study the particu- lars of
history, while the postmodernist insists we study power as an
over-arching, structurally encompassing phenomenon. And **[whether one
deploys the realist term, power, or its postmodem
variant,]{.underline}** power relations, **[both ultimately rely upon an
understanding of power that is rooted in struggle]{.underline}**. Thus
we realise that [our dialogue serves as an analytic of power within
which difference can be recognised and respected, without being absorbed
into a unifying totality]{.underline}. Both realists and postmodernists
discursively fill the content of the \`empty space of power with
referents such as order, discipline, vulnerability survival, uncertainty
and indeterminacy. And in this sense **[the two positions can be viewed
as mirror images]{.underline}**. Postmodemism, as discussed by Ashley
and Walker, is not an anarchical stance where anything goes, but a
process whereby difference can be expressed, negotiated and recognised
Within the disciplined effort of listening, questioning and speaking.
Similarly. **[realism]{.underline}** as dismissed by Morgenthau arid
Bull, **[is not a position whereby violence is sanctioned]{.underline}**
**[and recommended. Rather]{.underline}** it **[seeks to]{.underline}**
**[understand]{.underline}** **[how human difference can exist and be
protected it structural continuity is demanded by human sociability
itself. This is not,]{.underline}** in either case, **[a valorisation of
totalising chaos or violence]{.underline}**. This recognition of
otherness is further implicated in a larger con- textual struggle
involving the tactical and symbolic content that we ascribe to the
concept of power. Drawing upon Newman\'s notion of the empty place of
power enables us to open up the spaces within which power is rendered
visible and determined to beat work: These sites are the sites of
identity/difference, security/insecurity, order/disorder, sell/other,
vulnerability/invulnerability, and uncertainty/certainty. Security is
inextricably linked to power, which both realists and post- modernists
would concede, but what is the content of the security/power nexus?
[Power is already always implicated in the strug- gle to make life go
on, but security is the rationale, which underlies both realist and
postmodern reasons for the desire to exercise, resist or trans- gress
power in the first place]{.underline}. [**Realism and postmodernism
share a similar recognition that life involves struggle, and that the
concept of power serves as both a means and a site of
struggle**.]{.underline} But how we view this struggle is where we part
company and resume our agonistic postures. Postmodernists view struggle
in terms of an agonism, where individuals constitute them- selves as
contending identities\', whereas realists conceive of it as an essential
antagonism reflective of timeless modes of human nature.\~\' Thus we
have returned to a point of discursive incommensurability in our attempt
to conceptualise power\'s productive capacity for ushering in structural
change within the movement and construction of history For
postmodernists the admission and recognition of vulnerability serves as
a tactical way to resist and/or transgress realist power politics,
whereas for realists power can mitigate or lessen vulnerability.
Postmodernists focus on the survival of people in the broadest
definition of the term security, while realists focus on the survival
and security of the state, which they link to the survival of the nation
arid its people. But this return to an incommensurable difference is
precisely the point of our discussion because \`**[once historical
contingency and diversity enter the analysis opportunities for critique
and creativity in discussions of political possibility
increase]{.underline}**.

Power, Structure, History, and Ethics For realism and postmodernism,
power is pervasive and functions as both a capability and an effect.
Beyond these generic similarities, however, lie vast analytical
differences. **[Realism locates power in things -- such as bombs, money,
people, and institutions -- but these things must have an effect on
others.]{.underline}**9 That is, a gun in a closet of which no human
being is aware is not power. Instead, realists know that **[power exists
when it is exercised by an actor]{.underline}** (whether it a state or
individual) that utilises things regarded as powerful in order to impose
their preferences on others who would, in turn, prefer not to have such
imposition. Alternative preferences lead to resistance, the disruption
of the balance of power, and thus the use of power in order to
re-establish such balance. Resources that signal power are used to get
one's preferences or to resist letting others have their way. It is in
its effects that power is made known, thus, as Guzzini notes, realist
'power implies potential change, which in turn implies a counterfactual
situation of potential continuity'.10 **[Control and struggle are also
relevant to postmodern conceptualisations of power.]{.underline}**11
According to postmodernists, these two facets of power manifest
themselves in two distinct yet interrelated ways. First, **[there are
the physical and intellectual structures that impose certain ways of
knowing and doing things. Physical structures include the]{.underline}**
**[institutions of governmentality, such as
bureaucracies]{.underline}**, while the **[intellectual structures are
those which determine how we frame things and our knowledge of the
world.]{.underline}** Such structures are reflective of the productive
and deterministic aspects of power in that they **[produce fixed
identities, territorial grounding, origins of meaning, and
presence.]{.underline}** But the second sense in which power is analysed
emerges within Foucault's understanding of the relationality of power
and the possibilities for resisting structural domination. Since
**[power is conceptualised as fluid, reversible and
non-linear]{.underline}** (i.e., as a network or web), it carries within
it productive possibilities that can serve as resources not only to
resist structural constraints, but to (re)configure them. Within both
perspectives, then, **[resistance to the power imposed by structure is a
key point of analysis]{.underline}**, but realists are more interested
in how alternative preferences, which are embedded in and produced by
alternative and competing structures, **[utilise power in order to
resist one another.]{.underline}** Postmodernists, on the other hand,
are interested in how **[resistance to all structure is an act of power
in itself and has the potential to reconfigure existing physical and
intellectual structures.]{.underline}** Hence while **[both perspectives
concur that power is pervasive]{.underline}** **[and simultaneously a
structural and individual phenomenon, their analytical focus is very
different.]{.underline}** Neorealists and neoclassical realists focus on
state structures, with the former concentrating on inter-state
competition while the latter concentrates on intra-state competition.12
Alternatively, postmodernism is interested in acts of resistance to what
is structurally fixed and disciplinary. Resistance is a power resource
that insists upon being ad hoc and fluid, thereby preventing structures
from solidifying. In other words, **[while realism examines the
competition of structures which want to stay in being, postmodernism
examines resistance to structural ways of being.]{.underline}** In both
instances power is seen as a resource that is capable of simultaneously
maintaining structures and inducing historical change, but what wields
power and why it does so are seen to be very different. For realists,
historical change occurs within a timeless context of competing
structures which wield power against one another either to change the
status quo or maintain it. For postmodernists, historical change occurs
when structural fixity is displaced by acts of resistance, which are a
form of power. Because realists take as given the very structures that
postmodernists see as disciplinary and oppressive, postmodernists regard
realist analysis as part of the problem. Epistemologically realists
separate the analysis of power from its practice, but postmodernists
argue that analysis is practice, and therefore taking structures as
analytical givens only reifies them. Because structure and domination
are intertwined, there is an openly ethical dimension to all postmodern
IR analysis and heeding those voices that contest the disciplinary power
of ostensibly given structures is central to postmodernism's analytical
practice. Such voices are found at the margins of inter- and intra-state
relations. Realism, on the other hand, ignores these voices because it
is skeptical of the ability to displace existing structures, and it
assumes that structural reconstitution in one form or another is a fact
of human existence. What happens after the power of resistance has been
unleashed and existing structures are displaced is a particular worry of
realists, since the opposite of structure is anarchy and newly
constituted structures may be relatively worse than what was
displaced.13 This may explain why realists analyse power as outcome, and
the limitations on power identified by realists involve the relative
inability to exercise power effectively and obtain one's preferences.
Realism focuses on the aftermath of power's exercise, because it is
skeptical and fearful of structural disruption. **[The similarities and
differences between realist and postmodern conceptions of power,
structure, history, and ethics are reflected in our discussion of the
China-Taiwan relationship that follows]{.underline}**. The **[realist
analysis conceives of the China-Taiwan relationship as a power struggle
between three states,]{.underline}** which each have contradictory
preferences: **[the United States (US), the People's Republic of China
(PRC), and Taiwan.]{.underline}** Taiwan's intra-state political
structures are particularly important to this trilateral power struggle
because **[Taiwanese and Chinese preferences are zero-sum, and Taiwan's
electoral politics (and the role of identity formation in these
politics) impacts its relationship with China.]{.underline}** State
structures on both sides of the Taiwan straits reinforce the desire for
settled identities that are ultimately zero-sum, as does the inter-state
relationship between all three states. Thus the possibility of violence
among these three states remains relatively high. **[The postmodern
analysis, conversely, conceives of the ChinaTaiwan relationship as
representing both structural closure and an opportunity for structural
change. State leaders and policy-makers on both sides of the straits are
seen as seeking to impose a closure of identity and thus to foreclose
more ethically acceptable change. Post modernists thus focus on the
voices of resistance to such closures, particularly in Taiwan (and in
contradistinction to realism's focus on its intra-state]{.underline}**
structures). **[These voices must be recognised and thereby encouraged,
since it is in the act of resistance that the possibility of radical
reconfiguration of existing structures may be found.]{.underline}** In
this way the belief that identity relationships are zero-sum and
violence is inevitable may be subverted from within the relationship
itself. We now turn to a dialogue between realism and postmodernism in
order to problematise these conceptualisations of power.

Realist Power Struggle: US-China-Taiwan **[What does it mean to say 'the
China-Taiwan relationship'?]{.underline}** For a structural realist
there is an obvious reality with respect to Taiwan, but it begins
**[with the US and the PRC, which are both concerned with the potential
damage that the other could do to their national security and
economies.]{.underline}**14 These concerns result from **[each
nation-state's desire to dominate the politics and economics of the
region,]{.underline}** and both possess substantial resources in this
regard, including large numbers and types of military weapons, large
portions of their citizenry engaged in their militaries, sizeable
economies, vast networks of trading partners and linkages, and
considerable financial resources and influence. Given the military
resources each possesses, combined with the trade linkages they have
developed with one another, both nation-states seek to avoid direct
military confrontations with one another. **[Yet they also
simultaneously seek to balance one another's military and economic power
in order to avoid any advantage the other might accrue in their
competition for regional domination.]{.underline}** From a structural
realist perspective, **[Taiwan represents a third and relatively weaker
entity in the mix]{.underline}**. For the PRC, Taiwan represents
unfinished business.15 Originally a province of China, Taiwan is an
island 100 miles off the coast of China's Fukien province, and the body
of water that separates them, the Taiwan Strait, is a major commercial
shipping avenue. Taiwan had been annexed to and occupied by the Japanese
from 1895 until 1945 when it was returned to China. When the
decades-long Chinese civil war culminated in a communist victory over
the mainland in 1949, remnants of the US-supported Nationalists
(Kuomintang or KMT) escaped to the island and established their own
government, the Republic of China (ROC). From its inception, the ROC was
intended to be a temporary solution. The Nationalists argued that they
were the sole legitimate government of China and insisted that they
would some day re-conquer the mainland. Meanwhile the PRC made plans to
reclaim Taiwan after it had consolidated power on the mainland. What
prevented this invasion was the US interest in balancing Chinese
aggression in light of the Korean War. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s
Taiwan became the cornerstone in the US Cold War containment strategy in
Asia. The US sent naval forces into the Taiwan Strait several times in
response to Chinese provocations, it supplied the ROC with economic aid,
and it signed a mutual defense treaty with it in 1954. This Cold War
context changed by the early 1970s, however, as China had by then
developed a mutual interest with the US in counter-balancing the Soviet
Union, and the US and China explored the possibility of improved
relations. In 1979 the US established full diplomatic relations with the
PRC, terminated its 1954 mutual security pact with Taiwan, and
reaffirmed the one-China principle that there is only one China and
Taiwan is a part of it. Simultaneously, however, the US adopted the 1979
Taiwan Relations Act, which declared that the US has a commitment to
Taiwan's security and is obligated to sell sophisticated defensive arms
to it. The US has also consistently argued it has a right to pro tect
Taiwan from the PRC, and in 1996 it dispatched two aircraft carrier
groups to the region in response to Chinese military activities in the
strait. The triangular relationship between the US, the PRC, and the ROC
is replete with strategic deterrent calculations. **[The US attempts to
pacify China with regards to Taiwan while also containing China and
protecting Taiwan from it. The PRC attempts to intimidate Taiwan while
preventing direct US involvement in their bilateral conflict. And the
ROC seeks to maintain and increase its independence from China while
being careful not to alienate American support.]{.underline}** This
trilateral structural relationship can also be examined from a
neoclassical realist perspective, which focuses on the domestic politics
of these states. Competing subgroups within the US, the PRC, and the ROC
emphasise either cooperative economic linkages or militaristic policies
in their relationships with one another. The extent to which any of
these particular subgroups are in ascendance results from electoral
competition in the US and the ROC, and internal bureaucratic struggles
in the PRC.16 Taiwan's development into a full-fledged democracy in the
1990s has increased hostilities between the ROC and the PRC, because
democratisation allowed the main pro-independence political party, the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), to gain control over and utilise
state power in the pursuit of its nationalist policies. Given
neoclassical realism's concern with non-systemic variables, the
**[impact of identity formation on intra-state politics in Taiwan is
particularly important. The DPP and other pro-independence groups are
intimately linked to a Taiwanese identity that sees itself as distinct
from that of mainland China.]{.underline}** These Taiwanese, who
emigrated from Mainland China before World War II and may be divided
into two groups (Hoklos and Hakkas) based on linguistic differences,
constitute eighty five percent of the population17 'Mainlanders' are the
Mandarinspeaking KMT who retreated to Taiwan after WWII; they constitute
only fourteen percent of the population. As long as the Nationalists
prevailed electorally, Taiwan pursued a foreign policy with China that
subtly mixed accommodation (including the public acceptance of the
oneChina principle) and resistance (such as pursuing sovereign member
ship in IGOs). Under the DPP, on the other hand, Taiwan has declared its
intention to become a full-fledged sovereign nation-state within the
next ten years; something the PRC has consistently indicated it will use
force to prevent. **[These internal developments make conflict between
the PRC and the ROC even more likely than international structural
considerations alone would have done.]{.underline}** Given US strategic
interests in the region, the Taiwan Strait is, as David Lampton,
Director of China Studies at John Hopkins observes, 'the only probable
place . . . where two big nuclear powers could come into conflict'.18
Postmodern Recognition and Expressions of Doubt From a postmodern
perspective, **[power is already at play in the ways in which a realist
analysis describes and discusses what it has supposedly objectively
framed as a potentially dangerous flashpoint]{.underline}**.19 But how
can postmodernism maintain that power is implicit in the very act of
describing the realist version of 'reality'? Can this exercise of power
be drawn out and made visible? The key lies in explicating **[the
postmodern claim that not only is IR a discursive process, but that it
is 'a process of knowledge as power'.]{.underline}**20 Starting from
this perspective, power is understood in terms of its relational
context. **[Power relations are made known where attempts are made to
bring ambiguity under control, where a privileged interpretation
emerges, or where conduct is disciplined and discourse
limited.]{.underline}**21 Thus **[when we choose to comprehend the world
in a certain way, we thereby impose an order on it which must inevitably
be held in place by power;]{.underline}** a power which simultaneously
produces us as 'knowers' of the world and disciplines us to know the
world in accordance with an established mode of certitude.22 **[Realism
is the established mode of certitude through which we have come to know
the international, and it centers on national security as power
politics.]{.underline}** According to Taiwan's 'Guidelines for National
Unification' issued in 1991, for example, any timeframe for the
unification of Taiwan and China must 'respect the rights and interests
of the people in the Taiwan area, and protect their security and
welfare'.23 **[Realism's national security power/knowledge grid
establishes the order whereby security and welfare are conflated with
the state and deployed to justify the use (or threat) of violence in
order to maintain that discursive equation of state and
security/welfare.]{.underline}** It is this frame of sovereign certitude
that a postmodern analysis seeks to disrupt. **[It is
not,]{.underline}** as George suggests, t**[hat postmodernists are
attempting to somehow move beyond power, but rather that they are
attempting to shift the focus of the knowledge/power grid through which
we represent the world of IR.]{.underline}**24 **[In order to radically
question the singular, irreducible version of reality imposed on the
world via realist politics, we need to look to the various marginal
sites and be attentive to]{.underline}** what Ashley refers to as the
'**[reality of human struggles to make life go]{.underline}** on'.25
**[We need to look at the various local sites where identity and
territoriality have been thrown into radical doubt]{.underline}**. This
**[recognition of radical doubt opens a space for individuals to
question and resist those who would marshal the forces of violence in
the name of territorial certitude.]{.underline}**26 **[This recognition
shifts us from relations of power that define security in terms of
national security, to relations of power that exceed the limited purview
of states. One site to deconstruct is the representation of two titanic
foes,]{.underline}** the US and China, squaring off in a primordial
contest between good and evil. Such a dichotomous representational frame
oversimplifies myriad complexities and **[also encourages political
practices which necessarily categorise actions,]{.underline}** words and
thoughts as either/or. Framing China as a 'looming menace' scripts a
scenario whereby cross-strait relations become denotated as one of the
most dangerous sites in global politics. This script easily roles over
into an attitude of resignation like that clearly expressed by Kurt
Campbell, Director of the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, when he admits that it appears as if almost inexorable forces
are at work in the straits area.27 Disrupting this realist
representation of reality entails drawing out counter narratives.
**[Certainly one marginal site where acts of resistance and
transgression are transpiring is in the movement of Taiwan's indigenous
peoples for recognition and cultural survival.]{.underline}** There are
currently eleven major indigenous peoples in Taiwan who make up less
than two percent of the total population. Prejudice, pressures to
assimilate and a general underprivileged status constitute the context
within which they struggle to make life go on. It is here, in **[their
marginal existence]{.underline}**, that the power deployed to
**[construct an overarching, unified, national Taiwanese identity
becomes visible]{.underline}**. Many of these groups have become
politically active at both the local and national levels in order to
promote the welfare of their communities and to maintain their
expression of difference.28 They fear the narrative power of Taiwanese
national identity, which threatens to subsume and eventually erase their
cultural and historical memory.29 **[These are marginalised sites of
difference, yet they locate a possibility that contests the
inevitability of a move toward the solidification of one homogenising
national Taiwanese identity]{.underline}**. In these sites of struggle
security issues are also of paramount concern, but the security issues
here are qualitatively different than those glimpsed from the
triangulation of US, Chinese, and Taiwanese representations of national
security. These sites are fraught with doubt, contingency and chance,
and they expose how focusing on titanic struggles between competing
national identities and strategic foes is merely an attempt to impose a
simplistic order on the complexity of life itself. It is not that the
state is irrelevant to postmodern concerns, but **[in order to
problematise discourses that presume the inevitability and historical
necessity of the state, we must locate sites of contestation that do not
conflate state security and survival with that of individuals or
communities.]{.underline}** It is the rupture between these paradoxical
positions that postmodernism seeks to explore.30

Realism is What States Do It is not that change is not possible in
realism, or that alternative sites of struggle are not important, but
the parameters of and sites of struggle for change highlighted by
postmodernism seem analytically misplaced. If 'realism' is not simply
explanation by ivory-tower academics but is what states and
policy-makers do (**[it is, after all, Chinese and US officials who
designate one another as menaces, and it is Taiwanese state officials
who equate national security and welfare in their own documents), then
why study the marginalised instead of the states and policy-makers
involved?]{.underline}** Why not talk about change within the context of
state-society politics and among state policy-makers? The state is one
of the ultimate sites of political, economic, and social struggle and
power in contemporary world politics, and it seems counter-productive to
look for and promote change in representative practices while
simultaneously ignoring the state and its relationship to these
alternative sites of representation. If change is both possible and
afoot in our representations of the world, shouldn't it be recognisable
in the politics of and struggle over the state and its functions in
society? The fact that many states, such as the US and the ROC, are
democracies underscores this point, since they have been institutionally
designed to respond to majorities and minorities within their societies.
Even China's totalitarian regime responds to multiple interests
emanating from its society. Hence it is not clear to realists why a
discussion of the marginalised does not also involve understanding the
structural mechanisms whereby doubt and uncertainty are translated into
political practice. Conversely, while there is a great deal of radical
doubt in the world, but not all of it matters to individual security or
territorial violence and competition among nation-states. **[If the
radical doubt engendered by the marginalised (in this case, two percent
of Taiwan's population) is not realised through state structures, then
studying them won't get us any closer to understanding change and stasis
in the ChinaTaiwan relationship.]{.underline}** Wouldn't our
understanding of change in this triangular relationship be better served
by examining how the majority and the minority interact within the
political structures, parties, and interest groups of the US, the PRC,
and the ROC and, in so doing, effect the politics and behavior of the
other states involved? Postmodern Responsibility to Otherness Such
realist queries go to the heart of alterity in postmodern analysis.
There is, **[in the continued realist focus on the state, an underlying
presumption that there is a necessity for stability and order that can
only be maintained with the perpetuation of a state-centric
system]{.underline}**. Perhaps most problematic are the effects of a
realist perspective that would marshal all of its power in an effort to
discipline and limit the individual's prospects for 'self-making in a
register of freedom'.31 Ashley and Walker describe freedom as that which
exists prior to the imposition of limitations, necessity and need. On
one level then, freedom finds its expression in a register or space
which provides an opening to contemplate new ethical modes of behavior
in the conduct of international politics. Thus self-making in a register
of freedom becomes possible amid the recognition of the contingency,
chance and ambiguity of life. Yet, this process of self-making does not
transpire in a relational vacuum, nor is it a freedom in which anything
goes. According to Ashley and Walker, all those engaged in questioning
boundaries and resisting the imposition of limitations share the problem
of freedom. And while no one's paradigm for questioning, resisting and
/or transgressing boundaries should become the universal or standard
paradigm for others to replicate, such freedom enacts an ethics that
'does discipline the active labor of self-making, orienting that labor
not only to respect the uncertainties of every immediate locality but
also to explore the connections across localities upon which the
struggle for freedom depends'.32 Thus **[postmodernism offers its
version of a de-territorialised ethics, which draws its power from an
engagement between individuals across locales who struggle to resist the
sovereign imperative of exclusion in all its various
guise]{.underline}**s.33 An interesting vantage point from which to view
this 'open-ended, always hazardous contest among plural cultural
possibilities' is **[within the contentious debate over the construction
and content of Taiwanese literature]{.underline}**.34 This debate has
engaged scholars on both sides of the straits, and has profound
implications for future cross-strait relations because at its heart lies
issues of self-reflexivity and identity. Nativists advocate the creation
of a Taiwanese national literature distinct from other Asian literary
expressions and traditions. As Tang notes, these scholars and writers
exemplify a 'willingness and desire to identify with and represent the
land of Taiwan'.35 However, this representation trades on the positing
of a nativist identity in opposition to an oppressive Chinese other.
Tang confirms that the nativist '**[objective is to institute and
fortify a new sense of collective identity often through instilling a
victim consciousness, so as to lend cultural and moral legitimacy to the
pursuit for political selfdetermination']{.underline}**.36 Nativist
literature thus reiterates the binding tie between people and territory
while **[relying on the identification of China as a looming, ominous
threat.]{.underline}** This literary debate is the site of disagreement
and contest where **[issues of identity intersect with issues of
originality (self-determination), particularity (authenticity) and
subjectivity (national sovereignty)]{.underline}**.37 The impulse of
some within the nativist camp is to reduce these crosscutting currents
to a simple juxtaposition between separatists and unificationists,
delineating the choice as an either/or determination between those
Taiwanese who are pro-independence and those who favor eventual
reunification with China. For instance, Chen Wanyi criticises the more
exclusionary aspects of nativism and espouses the development of a
literary tradition that includes 'literature written in the Taiwanese
dialect', 'Hakka literature', 'literature of the indigenous people', and
'military compound literature'.38 Ultimately what Tang advocates is
encouraging a fluid exchange of ideas that keeps alive the play of
difference and ambiguity. The point, then, is to open up possibilities
for cross-strait discussions and the exploration of connections that
would recognise the struggles for freedom occurring across these various
locales. **[From a postmodern perspective, the crucial activity is to
question, test and expose the power that lies behind the impulse to
construct and impose an exclusionary version of either Chinese or
Taiwanese identity that would demarcate itself as a bounded, sovereign
territorial space compelled to defend the certitude of its identity by
the threat, or actual use, of force.]{.underline}** Realist Identity and
Reinforcing Structures **[It is precisely the equation between the state
and order that leads realism, in turn, to question the possibility of
such a de-territorialised postmodern ethics]{.underline}**. The
postmodern notion of 'self-making in a register of freedom' suggests
that individuals can and want to be free to remake their identity but
that they are prevented from doing so by the state. The problem with
such a formulation from a realist perspective is that individuals do not
want freedom from settled identity; and in any case it is the nation,
not the state, that is the chief oppressor in this regard. Human beings
are social creatures whose humanity is only realisable within the
context of a group, and, as a result, human beings do not embrace
identity ambiguity.39 They will form groups even when there is no
rational reason to do so, and group formation means the demarcation of
identity difference from other human beings. What binds a collective of
individuals is always the opposition to something normatively different,
external, and less desirable, because without this juxtaposition the
members of a collective cannot know who they are and they cannot
function as a collective. The need for order and stability is not a
function of the state, then, it is a function of human sociability that
derives, in turn, from the anarchic conditions of species evolution.
**[Postmodernism is correct to argue that the act of identity-settling
is never complete and the content of identity
contestable.]{.underline}** This is what allows for identity
manipulation, imposition, and subjugation in the name of a greater
collective good. **[But realism counter-proposes that the human need for
a settled identity is stronger than the desire for contestability, and
the voices offering ambiguity and contingency cannot prevail against
those offering clarity of identity difference instead]{.underline}**. In
contemporary world politics the most pertinent group identity is the
nation, which subsumes other forms of group identity and is married to
the state as a type of social institution and process for determining
intragroup resource decisions.40 **[Individual identity is intimately
linked to the state as the primary decision-making structure for the
national collective. A refusal to engage]{.underline}** **[in this link
analytically means an analytical failure to recognise how important the
state remains for intra-national quarrels over identity and resource
allocation. And to encourage the identity ambiguity while refusing
engagement with the state is to play into the hands of the forces that
post-modernists wish to counter-act: the builders of
territorially-defined nation-states.]{.underline}** It is no accident,
then, that the ROC's development into a fullfledged democracy gave
pro-independence forces access to the Taiwanese state and the
opportunity to enact policies that encourage nationalist identity
difference. Early pro-independence movements were as much about
secession from China as they were opposition to the KMT's authoritarian
rule over Taiwan between 1949 and 1989, and there was an ethnic link
between China and the KMT that was in opposition to the island's
Taiwanese majority. For many Taiwanese, 'they belong to a separate
nation that has no more enduring connections to China than it does to
Japan or even the Netherlands, its former colonial rulers'.41 This has
proven to be electorally significant, and the DPP candidate, Chen
Shui-bien, won the Presidency in 2000 and 2004 on a party platform that
aligns pro-independence with Taiwanese ethnicity. Taiwanese ethnic
identity began 'enjoying a tailwind of popular support' during Chen's
first term, and the 2004 Presidential election was cast 'as a choice
between subjugation to Communist China and Taiwanese nationalism'.42
Conversely, the political identity of the Taiwanese Nationalists is rife
with ambiguity, which works to the political advantage of the DPP.
Voting margins from the last two Presidential elections, in which Chen
won by thirty-nine percent and fifty percent, suggest to electoral
strategists that the Nationalists will need to embrace native Taiwanese
nationalism, and downplay their Mandarin Chinese ethnic identities, if
they wish to prevail electorally.43 Meanwhile, Chen and the DPP show
every sign of pursuing the nation-state building agenda of their
campaign, which includes revising the Taiwanese constitution,
restructuring its government, redefining Taiwan's territory, and
changing the ROC's name to the Republic of Taiwan. According to Yan
Xuetong, a foreign policy expert at Beijing's Quingha University, Chen
'is determined to be the founding father of a new nation by 2008';44
something which China has vowed to prevent with force if necessary.
Competitive elections over control of the state are a driving force in
the upsurge in Taiwanese nationalism, because the state remains the
primary resource allocating institution of contemporary global politics.
Hence access to and control over it ensures the ability to pursue and
obtain specified preferences and agendas, and so it is a site where
struggles over resource control and identity differentiation come
together. **[Failure to examine the political and national struggles
over state control that occur on a daily basis around the globe, and a
preference for the study of the marginalised and ambiguous instead, will
get us no closer to understanding or realising individual identity or
security; either globally, or in the Chinese-Taiwanese relationship
specifically]{.underline}**. And to suggest to individuals and subgroups
within China and Taiwan that their cause will be furthered by embracing
identity ambiguity while simultaneously refusing participation in the
state, is not simply unrealistic; it is an ethical abdication in its own
right, as there is no surer way to marginalise oneself from the sites of
and exercise of power.

#### rethinking assumptions through a postmodern lens allows a multiplicity of views to emerge

Difference and Ambiguity as Postmodern Political Resources The realist
insistence that power is something that has a specific location and can
be possessed is precisely the problem from a postmodern perspective.
Postmodern power is not rooted in material capabilities, in access to
institutional assets, nor in expressions of violent governmental force,
it is rooted in doubt, uncertainty and vulnerability. In opposition to
the centrality of order and unity in a realist analysis, the role of
uncertainty and doubt are crucial to postmodern power. Power constrains
and limits, but it can also be said to constitute and produce certain
modes of subjectivity. Where knowledge is expressed as certitude and
order, as in the modern concept of sovereignty, power functions to
produce docile and disciplined subjects. Knowledge claims imbued with
doubt spawn resistant subjects because uncertainty and multiplicity
encourage 'the undecidability of being and the proliferation of meaning
as effective techniques of power'.45 For Foucault there can be no
exercise of power without resistance because power operates within a
relational web.46 If there were no possibility for resistance then a
totalitarian order would emerge which would foreclose all possibilities
for active, political resistance and all possibility for political
relationships. Hence power functions to produce subjects who are free to
create themselves. **[Doubt gives those confronted with knowledge claims
pause to rethink their presumptions, assumptions and conclusions. Such a
pause opens the space to think things anew and it also provides a space
for a multiplicity of views to emerge.]{.underline}** Together, **[doubt
and multiplicity operate as political resources to resist and transgress
current modes of subjectivity.]{.underline}** The postmodern
conceptualisation of power ultimately relies upon the ability of
individual thought to 'present it \[power\] to oneself as an object of
thought and question it as to its meaning, its conditions, and its
goals'.47 Thought is capable of creating a critical space between itself
and external events, and this is the space where postmodern power
becomes visible. This power is a power immanent only in the present and
in the possibility inherent in the exercise of self-creative freedom.
Power is productive in the immanently local moment wherein the
individual exercises their capacity for critical thought, and they are
empowered to challenge power's disciplinary order because they too can
access power's productive capability.48 Thus the expression of
difference opens the space wherein **[the individual can confront the
existing web of power relations with an expression of that which
it]{.underline}** (the existing set of power relations) **[has yet to
know, yet to discipline within its established set of
practices.]{.underline}** Proliferating sites of difference are the
immanent conditions of possibility for expressions of freedom and
self-making. Difference and ambiguity are political resources that could
serve to move the discussion beyond the confines of nationalist ideology
and realist certitude by drawing attention to the ways in which the
**[constructs of 'Taiwan' and 'China' function as absolute
signifiers.]{.underline}** To return to the example of Taiwanese
literature, nativist discursive framings are open to disruption by
calling attention to the island's varied mix of Malayo-Polynesian,
Japanese Chinese, Dutch, Spanish, American and other cultural legacies;
the struggle of the indigenous peoples for social justice amid
assimilationist pressures; the rise of consumer, environmental, labor,
women's, students, aboriginal and human rights social movements; and the
gay and lesbian counter-culture movements.49 The simple dichotomisation
that would reduce these complex and varied expressions of identity down
to an either or choice between Taiwaneseness or Chineseness would miss
the complexity and nuance of these other contentious identity debates.
Thus, Peng Ruijin, who served as editor of Literary Taiwan, cautioned
the nativists, who are striving to establish a new literary tradition
for Taiwan, that they 'do not have the right to restage a historical
tragedy, to manufacture the authenticity of Taiwan literature and
monopolise the right of interpretation'.50 What has been transpiring
within Taiwanese politics constitutes a paradigmatic expression of the
postmodern play of power. It involves a struggle between competing
iterations of foundational origins, collective memories and
memoralisations that reveal an active and engaged struggle to attach
meaning to the noun 'Taiwan' and its correlate, 'Taiwanese'. This is a
struggle over definition and signification that is shot through with
power. Within this struggle we can witness the contention and
competition among a proliferation of different voices from various
social, political and economic sites. Will this polyphonic discourse
succumb to the pressures of homogenisation and uniformity or will it
remain indeterminately open? How power coalesces around these two
trajectories will inevitably shape not only Taiwan's identity, but also
its relationship with China. In other words, how will the
knowledge/power nexus play out? **[Will the play of power in Taiwanese
politics open up possibilities for the emergence of a new form of
subjectivity?]{.underline}** Postmodernism analyses these possibilities
and **[indicates that the key to a new form of subjectivity lies within
the practices of creativity, tolerance and
self-transformation]{.underline}**. Tang advises those involved in the
debate over the concept of Taiwanese literature to recognise the play of
ambiguity and difference in their own discussions and to be open to the
ambiguity, difference and contestation that is also playing itself out
in China.51 He refuses attempts to impose a monolithic identity on
either China or Taiwan.52 Sebastian Hsien-hao Liao advocates the
cultivation of Taiwan's internal hybridity as a resource in order to
negotiate crossstrait relations. He argues that the cultural drive for a
pure and totalising expression of Taiwanese identity requires the
positing of a contaminated, impure and threatening other. Thus Hsien-hao
Liao concludes, 'If Taiwan's being contaminated by China were no longer
considered a problem, China would not be perceived as a monolith. Then,
and only then, could (the threat of) "China" be "dissolved" . . .
through constructive cross-strait dialogues on the basis of a
recognition of the multiple temporalities inherent in all
socioscapes'.53 In sum, the recognition of ambiguity and difference
within one's own position, as well as that of the other, is a tactical
resource that has the potential to rescript the possibilities for
politics across the region. A postmodern approach to cross-strait
relations seeks to locate sites of disruption where discourses that
emphasise territorial integrity and political sovereignty are laid open
to ambiguity and uncertainty. The point is to isolate those ongoing
discussions and disagreements over the composition of national identity,
history, and political and cultural legitimacy, in order to expose the
contingency of all national, territorial security discourses. It is in
the exposure of those contingencies that change becomes possible.
Zero-Sum Interests and the Realist State Granting that postmodernism is
seeking out the sources for radical change in and of the Westphalian
sovereign system, how else are sources for rescripting to become
translated into change in the ChineseTaiwanese relationship except via
the nations of China and Taiwan, their respective states, and the
strategic relationship they share with the US? Doesn't the Taiwanese
state also protect identity difference from Chinese repression?
Collective identities may be socially-constructed, but their content can
still be zero-sum. What would it have meant for the individuals of
Taiwan in the 1970s to have refused the national, territorial security
discourses of realism and to have embraced identity tolerance with China
instead? Certainly the latter could only have been achieved by embracing
China on its own terms, and so it would have involved the political and
economic subjugation of the Taiwanese people to Beijing. The vast
majority of Taiwanese were already victims of identity intolerance at
the hands of the Nationalist KMT, but they were neither
Mandarinspeaking, nor did they identify with the Chinese mainland.
Although the KMT were initially welcomed by the Taiwanese population as
liberators from the Japanese occupation, Soong notes that 'the
expectation that Taiwanese could now share power with their "mainland
brothers" was crushed by the KMT'.54 Clashes and civil unrest ensued
over KMT authoritarianism, corruption, and favoritism, and in 1947 the
KMT declared martial law. The formation of political parties was banned,
the military was given considerable legal and censorship powers,
thousands of opponents were executed, and for the next thirty-five years
Taiwan became a virtual police state dominated by Mainlanders who
insisted that Mandarin be the official language. While the KMT remained
obsessed with returning to mainland China, it was not a goal shared by
many Taiwanese. Those who dreamt of Taiwanese independence from China
developed underground or overseas movements that later evolved into the
DPP. There was little desire among the majority of Taiwanese to embrace
identity tolerance with China on the latter's terms. Simultaneously,
there was the possibility of greater participation in the political
institutions of Taiwan itself. For the Taiwanese, at that moment, to
have refused the national, territorial security discourses of IR in
favor of ambiguity and tolerance would have been to refuse the very
identity and goals that distinguished them from the KMT and mainland
Chinese (and for which many of them had suffered). It would have meant a
refusal of themselves, which hardly seems likely or even desirable. As
Elshtain puts it, 'we are dealing with identities, remember, not easily
sloughed off external garments'.55 To say that if the Taiwanese stop
thinking of China as a problem then tensions will dissolve is true in an
abstract sense but not in any practical sense for the vast majority of
people who live these identities. **[It was the Taiwanese desire to
embrace statehood and the parameters of the Westphalian system that,
along with US strategic deterrence, prevented a Chinese invasion of
Taiwan]{.underline}**. To argue that the individuals of Taiwan would be
safer if they refused statehood is to ignore the Chinese commitment
since 1949 to subjugate Taiwan according to its own identity parameters.
It is also to ignore the desire of the vast majority of Taiwanese not to
be subjugated according to those parameters. The ROC would not even
exist if it had not been for classic balance-of-power politics between
two nation-states, the US and China, in the context of the early Cold

Observations about a Realist-Postmodern Dialogue **[Both realism and
postmodernism have a problematic relationship with their
conceptualisations of power and its implication in the possibilities for
structural stasis and historical change.]{.underline}** For neoclassical
realism, there is no other way to understand contemporary global
politics except through the **[institutions and mechanisms that national
groups continue to rely upon to make resource allocation
decisions.]{.underline}** Those who control such institutions will have
at their disposal material resources (such as weapons or currency
reserves) and ideational resources (such as the moral legitimacy to ask
individuals to die on behalf of group survival). These can be utilised
to pursue particular agendas and interests, and those pursuits involve
choices both within and between national groups over who will be
allocated what. Small wonder, then, that **[the state remains the
primary site of struggle in world politics according to realism, since
to those who control the group mechanisms of resource allocation go the
spoils.]{.underline}** Conversely, **[postmodern attempts to understand
global politics inevitably devolve into a study of conflicts from within
their local, contingent and historicised locations, because
postmodernists operate on the assumption that there is no universal
rationality that can uniformly comprehend and evaluate the entirety of
global politics.]{.underline}** However, the power to elude, resist, or
alter realist representational practices of power politics is always
already present within the emergent moment of thought and action. What
else then can postmodernism rely upon except anecdotal instances of
individual/collective acts of resistance and transgression to illustrate
the emergence of new forms of international subjectivity? There is no
one mode of being or form of subjectivity that can be deployed as a
measure of teleological progression. There is no one conception of
freedom that can be relied upon to evaluate expressions of self-making.
There is no final arbiter, no final measure upon which determinations of
success can come to rest. It is also interesting to observe that there
is something eerily similar in the conclusions of realism and
postmodernism juxtaposed here. The realist position cautions us to look
at the particulars of historical structure, while the postmodern
position draws our attention to the necessity of thinking more
expansively about the structure of historical possibility. Thus, in our
dialogue, **[the realist and the postmodernist have traded
places]{.underline}**; shifting the analytical divide so that **[in
order to understand stasis and change, the realist insists we study the
particulars of history, while the postmodernist insists we study power
as an over-arching, structurally encompassing phenomenon]{.underline}**.
And whether one deploys the realist term, power, or its postmodern
variant, power relations, both ultimately rely upon an understanding of
power that is rooted in struggle. Thus we realise that **[our dialogue
serves as an analytic of power within which difference can be recognised
and respected, without being absorbed into a unifying
totality.]{.underline}** Both realists and postmodernists discursively
fill the content of the 'empty space of power' with referents such as
order, discipline, vulnerability, survival, uncertainty and
indeterminacy. And in this sense **[the two positions can be viewed as
mirror images.]{.underline}** Postmodernism, as discussed by Ashley and
Walker, is not an anarchical stance where anything goes, but a process
whereby difference can be expressed, negotiated and recognised within
the disciplined effort of listening, questioning and speaking.
Similarly, realism, as discussed by Morgenthau and Bull, is not a
position whereby violence is sanctioned and recommended. Rather it seeks
to understand how human difference can exist and be protected if
structural continuity is demanded by human sociability itself. This is
not, in either case, a valorisation of totalising chaos or violence.
This recognition of otherness is further implicated in a larger
contextual struggle involving the tactical and symbolic content that we
ascribe to the concept of power. Drawing upon Newman's notion of the
'empty place of power' enables us to open up the spaces within which
power is rendered visible and determined to be at work.60 These sites
are the sites of identity/difference, security/insecurity,
order/disorder, self/other, vulnerability/invulnerability, and
uncertainty/certainty. Security is inextricably linked to power, which
both realists and postmodernists would concede, but what is the content
of the security/power nexus? Power is already always implicated in the
struggle to make life go on, but security is the rationale, which
underlies both realist and postmodern reasons for the desire to
exercise, resist or transgress power in the first place. Realism and
postmodernism share a similar recognition that life involves struggle,
and that the concept of power serves as both a means and a site of
struggle. But how we view this struggle is where we part company and
resume our agonistic postures. Postmodernists view struggle in terms of
an agonism, where individual's 'constitute themselves as contending
identities', whereas realists conceive of it as an essential antagonism
reflective of timeless modes of human nature.61 Thus we have returned to
a point of discursive incommensurability in our attempt to conceptualise
power's productive capacity for ushering in structural change within the
movement and construction of history. For postmodernists the admission
and recognition of vulnerability serves as a tactical way to resist
and/or transgress realist power politics, whereas for realists power can
mitigate or lessen vulnerability. Postmodernists focus on the survival
of people in the broadest definition of the term security, while
realists focus on the survival and security of the state, which they
link to the survival of the nation and its people. But this return to an
incommensurable difference is precisely the point of our discussion,
because 'once historical contingency and diversity enter the analysis,
opportunities for critique and creativity in discussions of political
possibility increase'.62

## Threat Reduction

#### cooperation with China makes conflict less likely -- self-interested behavior is suppressed and China's intentions are perceived as benign

The study seeks to explain **[the rise of \"China threat\" arguments in
the United States and Japan]{.underline}** in the 1990s by using three
theories of states behavior- realism, organization theory, and
democratic peace theory. **[The rise of \"China threat\" arguments
occurred]{.underline}** in the United States and Japan **[because of a
convergence of several factors, the most important of which was the
increase of China\'s relative power after the Cold War. The distribution
of power among states strongly affects their intentions and military
capabilities.]{.underline}** The study introduces and suggests **[the
importance of the strategic safety-net in shaping threat
perception.]{.underline}** **[A strategic safety-net emerges when
state\'s survival depends on cooperation with another state. When the
strategic safety-net exists, states suppress self-interested behavior
and the ally\'s intentions are perceived as benign]{.underline}**.
Interviews with former government officials in the United States and
Japan confirmed that strategic necessity restrained U.S. and Japanese
behavior towards China during the Cold War and limited suspicion of
China. **[The fraying of the strategic safety-net led to the advent of
\"China threat\" arguments]{.underline}**. ¶ (cont.) The main difference
between the United States and Japan was that whereas in the U.S. case
threat perception was shaped by a primacy strategy, Japan had to face a
preponderant United States and a rising China at the same time. \"China
threat\" arguments were suppressed in Japan while Japan was unsure about
its relationship with the United States**[. The consolidation of
Japan\'s relationship with the United States led to a surge of\"China
threat\" arguments]{.underline}** in Japan in 2000. The interests of
domestic organizations were not the major cause of the initial rise of
\"China threat\" arguments. The relevant organizations, including the
military services, made \"China threat\" arguments only after they
gained currency within the society. **[The study also finds that
China\'s undemocratic nature did not independently cause the perception
of threat.]{.underline}**

#### the plan restores US-China relations -- cooperation reverses the construction of China as a threat and takes out their internal links

**[The primacy strategy]{.underline}** requires that the United States
continue to prepare itself to fight major powers in the future. If the
primacy strategy succeeds and China is dissuaded, another target may be
necessary to sustain U.S. primacy. However, **[threat arguments involve
costs. This was why we observed a suppression of \"China threat\"
argument]{.underline}**s in Japan in the early- to mid-1990s, and **[a
decline of \"China threat\" arguments in the United States after the
September 11 terrorist attacks. States forsake possibilities of
cooperative relations by making threat arguments.]{.underline}** **[The
opportunity costs and benefits of making threat arguments have to be
weighed carefully.]{.underline}** The study found that in many cases,
military organizations were not the initiators of threat arguments but
were followers. This means that once threat arguments gain certain
currency in the policy making community, threat arguments are more
likely to be used to further organizational interests. More than a
decade has passed since the rise of \"China threat\" arguments in the
early-1990s. When the arguments started, some argued that \"China
threat\" arguments were a fad, soon to disappear. **[However, \"China
threat\" arguments increased in magnitude and intensity, and seem to be
on the rise again in the United States and in Japan
today]{.underline}**. History suggests that there might be an increase
of \"China threat\" arguments in the future. As \"China threat\"
arguments gained currency, more organizations made \"China threat\"
arguments. **[This has resulted in a spread of \"China threat\"
arguments and a deterioration of relations between the United States and
China - and Japan and China.]{.underline}** This trend is likely to
continue. Both in Washington and in Tokyo, \"China threat\" arguments
have become easier to make. This will increase the incentives to make
\"China threat\" arguments and decrease the incentives to argue against
the \"China threat.\" Finally, we can infer from the cases that **[China
will perceive the United States and Japan as threats.]{.underline}** The
United States has aggregate and military power far beyond China\'s.
Japan, while no longer developing rapidly and lacking some critical
military capabilities, also exceeds China\'s power in several areas. In
addition, the combined power of the United States and Japan far exceeds
that of China. Without the strategic safety-net provided by the Soviet
threat, China is likely to view the United States and Japan as threats.
This notion that **[China may be acting based on insecurity is often
forgotten in policy debates.]{.underline}** China is seen to act on its
own initiative rather than reacting to U.S. or Japanese actions. It
should be remembered that past wars have sometimes occurred when the
stronger power felt insecure about the rise of a weaker power. If China
has learned this lesson, it should be very worried about the United
States and Japan. **[It is important to remember that \"China threat\"
arguments that are intended to increase domestic support for security
strategies have audience in China and elsewhere. The consequences of
making threat arguments should be assessed and security dilemmas
minimized.]{.underline}**

Knowing and understanding the relationship between Chinese strategic
language and observable tactical level maneuvering is more a proactive
than reactive task for the United States and cannot be one guided by
latent hostility. **[Goldstein's "cooperation cycles" provide a starting
point by which Beijing and Washington might begin coming to agreement
through key points of concession.]{.underline}** In other words, the
Trump administration will need to "meet China halfway," and update prior
notions of American preeminence to count for the shifting balance of
power in the Indo-Asia-Pacific. Goldstein is right to make note of the
observable power shift and its 128 destabilizing side effects, **[but
the engagement process with China will also require an element of
in-depth intellectual discourse.]{.underline}** China must be engaged on
a deep philosophical level to disallow ambiguity on the tactical level
that inevitably translates from meta-strategic ideas, if Xi in fact
oscillates between the strategic bifurcation of Legalist praxis and
civilizational righteousness embedded in Confucian thought. A way the
U.S. and China might do this is through the collaboration and exchange
of high level officials and scholars to discuss more plainly the modus
operandi of each state's grand strategy. The particulars of tactics need
not be revealed, nor should the two nations agree on some common policy
trajectory, but future talks must be focused on getting at the deep
level questions that make up both American and Chinese first-causal
conceptions of world order. In the words of Oswald Spengler, there must
be an interaction between "the world as happening," and "the world as
history;" Between the "man of action," and "the man of contemplation,"
to engage the diverging philosophic conceptions of world order as they
are distinguished by Chinese and American thought. One might think of
this policy building block 129 as hybrid reflexivity, or an
interdisciplinary framework in which the relationship between truth,
order, destiny, history and policy is elucidated through pointed
dialogue, not simply "trust building." There must be, on the other hand,
a discussion about the "reality of things" not as mere the rhetorical,
archetypical, or symbolic significance they might have to a state's
grand strategy. In short, as Mircea Eliade sought to do in his text
Cosmos and History, policymakers must actively attempt to understand the
"deep meaning" or the "constituting metaphysics" bound up within the
"symbols, myths, and rights," that are habituated into our language.130
For it is within the layers of strategic language, discourse, and their
historicity that tactical ambiguity arises. The reconciliation of two
teleologies and two diverging epistemic conceptions of order rendered in
grand strategic preference, will most likely be disorderly, an
amalgamation of the organic and inorganic as China and the US continue
to engage one another in contested spaces.131 **[Warfare of the minds
must be the focus of future battles between Beijing and Washington,
pressing for a spiral of reassurance and collaboration rather than pure
transaction.]{.underline}** In addition to Goldstein's cooperation
spiral prescription, Xi and the Trump administration might commit to a
contractual form of explanation and understanding of strategic intent.
This proposal underscores what Eric Voegelin terms as man's "obligation
to understand his condition." And "part of this condition is the social
order in which he lives. . . This order has today become worldwide."
**[From these notions of order, meaning emerges and defense policy
follows. 132 Constructing strategic dialogue and exchange, in turn, will
require both Beijing and Washington to face the demanding task of
articulating the continuities in deeply held ideas about world order and
strategy. Only by doing this can both countries "coevolve" and maintain
order that both undeniably benefit from. Such is the distinction between
appeasement and engagement.]{.underline}**

### Solvency: Coop Solves Sec Dilemma

#### US-China cooperation reverses security dilemma logic -- key to avoid great power conflict

Preparing for his second term as U.S. president, Barack Obama has
reshuffled his cabinet, bringing on new secretaries of state and
defense. But despite the personnel changes in the second Obama
administration---as well as in China following its recent
once-in-a-decade leadership transition---the fundamentals of U.S. policy
toward Asia will not change. Yet, that does not mean the two sides
should not work to overcome the strategic distrust that plagues them. ¶
It was just four years ago that strategists such as Zbigniew Brzezinski
floated the idea of a Group of 2 (G2). And people's expectations for
U.S.-China cooperation ran high when President Obama went on a state
visit to China in October 2009, as the two countries declared in a joint
statement that they would endeavor to build a "positive, comprehensive,
and cooperative" relationship. That partly reflected the strong
sentiment at the time that common threats ranging from climate change to
financial crisis to nuclear proliferation would bind the two countries
together. ¶ But many analysts now agree that **[increasing strategic
distrust between China and the United States in recent years has posed
significant challenges not only to U.S.-China relations but also to
regional peace and security at large]{.underline}**. Since the end of
2009, the United States and China have drifted apart. The two powers are
increasingly trapped in an action-reaction cycle, so much so that many
lament that the United States and China are doomed for a "strategic
collision." ¶ Underlying the growing strategic distrust is an emerging
security dilemma---a situation in which one state's efforts to enhance
its own security will lead others to feel less secure---between Beijing
and Washington. Both the Chinese public and elite believe that the Obama
administration's pivot or rebalancing to Asia is a thinly veiled attempt
to restrain and counterbalance, if not encircle or contain, a rising
China. And many U.S. officials and analysts perceive an increasingly
assertive China that does not shy away from flexing its muscles,
"bullying" its neighbors, and pursuing its "narrow" interests
relentlessly. ¶ Numerous moves by the Obama administration have all been
perceived in China as evidence of U.S. hostility toward Beijing. These
moves have included deploying U.S. Marines to Darwin, Australia;
asserting U.S. interests in freedom of navigation in the South China
Sea; bolstering military alliances with the Philippines, Japan, and
Australia; enhancing security cooperation with Vietnam and India;
improving bilateral relations with Myanmar; and beefing up the United
States' ballistic missile defense systems in East Asia. ¶ **[Going
forward, the United States will continue to hedge against the rise of
China and perceived Chinese assertiveness. It will strengthen its
deterrence posture, build up its forward deployment, and reinforce
military alliances and security partnerships in Asia.]{.underline}**
Yet, because of the almost-inevitable shrinking of the U.S. defense
budget, it remains to be seen whether Washington can match its rhetoric
with action. ¶ Interestingly, quite a number of American analysts have
become critical of the Obama administration's handling of the U.S. pivot
or rebalancing to Asia, particularly of the way it was rolled out. Now,
even the administration officials have acknowledged that too much
emphasis was initially put on the military and security aspects of the
pivot**[. In that sense, the U.S. rebalancing strategy itself needs to
be "rebalanced."]{.underline}** It is likely that the second Obama
administration will recalibrate its approach by putting more emphasis on
economic cooperation and people-to-people exchanges in the Asia-Pacific,
including with China. ¶ The way the Chinese leadership transition is
structured and institutionalized ensures continuity and predictability
in China's foreign policy. Around the time President Obama was elected
to a second term, the Chinese leadership too changed. At the 18th
Congress of the Communist Party of China, a new Standing Committee of
the Politburo was elected. Xi Jinping, who has been China's vice
president since 2008, assumed the positions of general secretary of the
Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission. He
and Executive Vice Premier Li Keqiang, respectively, will almost
certainly assume the presidency and premiership at the National People's
Congress meeting next March. ¶ Both men have been in senior leadership
positions for many years. Other members of the top leadership have also
been in senior posts for quite some time. The new Chinese leadership
will maintain strong consensuses on major domestic and foreign policy
agendas, which prioritize the continuation of deeper reform and China's
peaceful development. ¶ Looking ahead, **[the U.S.-China relationship is
entering a challenging period.]{.underline}** How the relationship
between China and the United States is to be managed is a question that
will define the strategic landscape of the Asia-Pacific in the
twenty-first century. **[China and the United States should not allow
themselves to be engulfed by mutual hostility and suspicion, blindness
to the effects their actions have on the relationship, misperceptions,
and the fatalistic pessimism inherent in a hardcore realist mentality.
Rather, they should accurately gauge each other's strategic intentions
and try to increase mutual strategic understanding and trust through
candid discussion and exchanges at the highest level of
leadership.]{.underline}** ¶ **[To mitigate the emerging security
dilemma between the two countries, military-to-military exchanges and
cooperation are critical]{.underline}**. The recent development in
military-to-military relations---including a joint counter-piracy
exercise in the Gulf of Aden, a joint disaster-relief simulation and
exercise, and the United States inviting China to participate in the
2014 Pacific Rim Exercise---are all signs that the U.S.-China
relationship is moving in a positive direction. Increasing these
exchanges will gradually build mutual understanding and trust. ¶ **[In
the medium-to-long run, both countries also need to gradually develop a
shared vision of global affairs through genuine dialogue and
cooperation]{.underline}**. And to **[reverse the trend in both
countries to view the other as "the enemy,"]{.underline}**
people-to-people exchanges, particularly exchanges among young
generations and at local levels, need to be strengthened. ¶ The Chinese
leadership has now proposed **[a "new type of great-power relationship"
as the vision and intellectual framework for resolving a century-old
puzzle in international history]{.underline}**: whether it is possible
for rising powers and established powers to break away from a destiny of
conflict. The concept has been well received in the United States. Now
more creative and forward thinking is needed to further substantiate the
conceptual framework. ¶ **[The two sides must work together to draw a
roadmap for building a new type of great-power relationship between
China and the United States---one that transcends the logic of the
security dilemma and great-power conflict and that makes the world a
safer and better place to live.]{.underline}**

What is interesting about both of these worst-case scenarios is that
they carve out an important role for **[strategic empathy, or
perspective-taking]{.underline}**. Because hegemonic wars depend on the
rising power harboring revisionist intentions, **[debates in Washington
over how the United States should handle a rising China]{.underline}**
--- whether we should engage China and enmesh it in international
institutions (Ikenberry, 2008), **[reassure China by using reciprocal
gestures to reduce tensions]{.underline}** (Steinberg and O'Hanlon,
2014), contain it militarily (Mearsheimer, 2014), or some combination
thereof --- are partially debates about future states of the world (e.g.
how much will Chinese economic growth slow? How much will Chinese
nationalism rise?), but are also debates about what China wants
(Johnston, 2003). At their heart, then**[, American grand strategy
debates over the Asia-Pacific hinge on the fundamental challenge of
overcoming "the problem of other minds" and accurately assessing the
motivations of others]{.underline}** (Morgenthau, 1985; Herrmann, 1988).
As Butterfield (1951, 154) noted when coining what he referred to as the
"irreducible dilemma", **[the same attributional challenge serves as the
core of the security dilemma]{.underline}**. In his influential
discussions of the security dilemma, Jervis (1978, 181) discusses
environmental features that make security dilemmas more likely to occur,
but also explicitly attributes the dilemma to "failures of empathy\",
and notes that "empathy and skillful statesmanship can reduce this
danger\" (p. 212).7 **[An ability to put oneself in others' shoes is
also central to what Booth and Wheeler (2008) call "security dilemma
sensibility\",]{.underline}** crucial to breaking out of the dilemma.
Some of these challenges explicitly implicate strategic empathy at the
level of political elites. For example, if the theoretical literature
referenced above is accurate, **[maintaining a robust diplomatic corps
with deep area-specific knowledge should enable decision-makers to more
accurately understand how the Chinese government perceives their
country's national interests, helping American political leaders make
better decisions in both long-term planning and short-term
crises]{.underline}** (White, 1986). Others, though, also implicate the
mass public, the population we study here. This is obviously the case in
democratic countries like the United States, where the linkages between
public opinion and foreign policy are more solidified than in
non-democratic regimes like China (Holsti, 2004). As Kertzer (2016,
50-51) argues, **[public opinion shapes foreign policy in
democracies]{.underline}** through four pathways. IR scholars typically
focus on the direct pathway (what Aldrich et al., 2006 call "the
electoral connection\"), in which voters punish incumbents for foreign
policy misadventures (Fearon, 1994), but public opinion also exerts
influence on foreign policy through indirect pathways. One is "latent\"
public opinion, in which strategic politicians take expected public
reactions into account ex ante when formulating their policy choices
(Saunders, 2015); this is one reason why troop contributions to foreign
military interventions tend to oscillate with election cycles (Marinov,
Nomikos and Robbins, 2015). Another works through domestic opposition
groups, who are more likely to capsize the president's broader
legislative agenda when her foreign policy is unpopular (Gelpi and
Grieco, 2015). Another works through foreign decision-makers, who know
threats and promises coming out of the White House are less credible
when the mass public is not behind the President (Kertzer, 2016, 51).
**[In the specific case of US-China relations, Pew has found that
negative attitudes towards China have increased by 26 percentage points
in the United States since 2006]{.underline}**,8 and President Trump
made lambasting China a central part of his campaign speeches in the
2016 Presidential election. In experimental research, Tingley (2017)
finds that m**[any members of the American public tend to think of a
rising China using the same commitment problem framing that underlies
models of preventive war]{.underline}** (see also Gries, 2017).
Understanding how susceptible the US public is to security dilemma
thinking is a similarly worthy endeavor. Yet understanding whether
similar patterns exist in Chinese public opinion is also important. One
major concern among Western pundits is that the Chinese Communist
Party's domestic legit imacy is tied to maintaining high levels of
economic growth; as growth rates inevitably slow, the regime may instead
fan the flames of nationalism in the mass public, **[redirecting
discontent away from Beijing and towards foreign actors like the United
States]{.underline}** (Friedberg, 2005, 29-30). It is for this reason
that outside observers have been so fixated on nationalist sentiment in
the Chinese public (Weiss, 2014; Johnston, 2017), particularly if the
Chinese government cultivates nationalist protests at home as a way to
tie its hands in international negotiations abroad (Weiss, 2013, see
also Gries, 2001; Wallace and Weiss, 2015). Ross (2009), for example,
argues that China's maritime buildup is attributable to "naval
nationalism\" in a public that associates great power status with
maritime grandeur. More generally, a recent strand of research on
authoritarian accountability suggests that **[the Chinese government is
sensitive to public sentiment in a variety of ways]{.underline}** (e.g.
Chen, Pan and Xu, 2016; Distelhorst and Hou, 2017; Truex, 2016; Meng,
Pan and Ping, 2017). Indeed, despite maintaining an authoritarian
regime, **[the Chinese government spends considerable effort monitoring
public opinion;]{.underline}** Weiss and Dafoe (2016) note that the
Chinese government employs two million analysts to monitor public
sentiment on Chinese social media, precisely because it is aware of the
outsized role that domestic unrest has historically played in response
to international disputes. Better understanding the dynamics of Chinese
public opinion towards the use of force (e.g. Reilly, 2011; Li, Wang and
Chen, 2016; Weiss and Dafoe, 2016; Bell and Quek, 2018) is thus a
politically consequential task. 1.2 The dark side of strategic empathy
Does **[strategic empathy have the potential to dampen distrust and
mitigate security dilemma thinking between the United States and
China]{.underline}**? Much of the literature in both IR and American
politics summarized above, by pointing to the positive effects of
perspective-taking on building trust and reducing misperceptions, would
answer in the affirmative. If the security dilemma is indeed a "failure
of empathy\", redressing this surfeit should have beneficial effects.
**[According to this conventional wisdom, which we dub the palliative
effects of empathy hypothesis, more strategically empathetic individuals
should be less prone to misperceptions, and more likely to take other
perspectives into account. Encouraging individuals to think about the
situation from the perspective of the other side should lead them to
exercise more caution and prudence.]{.underline}**

### Solvency: Miscalc/Threat

#### US policy on Taiwan key to avoid threat construction

Third, **[in identifying dangerous sources of tension in U.S.-China
relations, scholars also provide policy recommendations that may help to
mitigate those tensions]{.underline}**. One debate includes whether U.S.
military presence in the Pacific acts as a stabilizing or exacerbating
force to regional stability. Christensen (1999) focuses on the security
dilemma in Sino-Japan relations and argues that the U.S. needs to be
mindful about expanding Japanese security role in the region. He advises
that the U.S. pursue development of theatre missile defense on their
own, so as to not abandon Taiwan but also **[avoid fueling
misperceptions of threat]{.underline}** between China and Japan. More
importantly, he highlights U.S. military presence as a stabilizing force
in the region whose sudden withdrawal can propel the region (mainly
Japan and China) into interstate armed conflict. In a follow-up article,
Christensen (2002) continues the discussion by arguing that **[U.S.
policy on the Cross-Strait relations necessitates both deterrence to
prevent the outright invasion of Taiwan]{.underline}**, but at the same
time, **[reassurance that U.S. involvement is not a means to subvert
China's political legitimacy over the island.]{.underline}** However,
Kang (2003) argues against the U.S.-asregional-stabilizer viewpoint,
positing that a strong China has historically coincided with extended
periods of peace and stability in the region. Therefore, **[withdrawal
of U.S. military presence in the Pacific will not inevitably lead to
catastrophe]{.underline}**. Additionally, U.S. military rebalancing
could actually prove counterproductive. Zhang (2011) similarly points to
U.S. demilitarization and less-hawkish political rhetoric as important
methods to moderating the security dilemma with China. **[Scholars
predominantly call for greater cooperation]{.underline}**, military
diplomacy exchanges, multilateral talks, **[and transparency between the
U.S. and China in order to reduce misperception and misinterpretation of
one another's intentions]{.underline}** (Liff and Ikenberry 2014; Zhang
2011; Zhe 2015; Christensen 2002). Johnson (2017) proposes that a more
nuanced understanding of the difference between military capabilities
and military intentions are **[vital in avoiding miscalculation of
threat]{.underline}**. Liff and Ikenberry (2014) argues **[that
recognition of the security dilemma occurring in interstate relations by
practitioners can help states to evade it.]{.underline}** "The United
States must avoid being unnecessarily provocative in its strategic moves
and rhetoric, more proactively explaining the comprehensive (not
military-specific) nature of its growing focus on the Asia Pacific and
linking it explicitly to a stable regional status quo that serves the
interests of all" (Liff and Inkenberry 2014, pg. 89). **[Scholars
highlight the importance of projecting benign intentions, promoting
greater transparency, and obtaining more accurate information to form
correct perceptions and thus, more effective U.S. foreign
policy.]{.underline}** China as a Threat and U.S. Foreign Policy in the
Asia-Pacific **[The discussion regarding the security dilemma in
U.S-China relations can also be situated in the broader
China-as-a-threat discourse.]{.underline}** Moreover, the U.S. pivot to
Asia under Obama's administration exemplifies a recent example of a U.S.
foreign policy response to the China-as-athreat perception, as it pushes
for the shifting of military focus from the Middle East to bases in the
Pacific. In other words, it is a significant example of a U.S. response
to the security dilemma with China, and thus, has generated much
discussion in both mainstream media and academia. A portion of the
China-as-a-threat literature includes assessments and cost-benefit
analyses of the Pacific Pivot, which outlines U.S. economic and military
objectives, challenges, and strategic propositions in order to
facilitate a successful rebalancing initiative (Manyin et al. 2012;
Futter 2015; Nguyen and Hang 2016; Campbell 2016). They argue that the
policy is necessary in maintaining security in the Asia-Pacific region
and frame China as a military and economic threat that must be
addressed. Other articles take more critical positions, as they analyze
the Pacific Pivot's potential impacts on U.S.-China relations, as well
as China's reaction to the increase of U.S. militarization of the
Pacific; they argue that increased military presence will exacerbate
already high tensions in the region, especially following ongoing issues
surrounding the SCS conflict (Swaine 2012; Ratner 2013). Furthermore,
Robert Ross (2012) contends that the "new U.S. policy unnecessarily
compounds Beijing\'s insecurities and will only feed China\'s
aggressiveness, undermine regional stability, and decrease the
possibility of cooperation between Beijing and Washington" (pg. 71). In
essence, he states that the Pacific Pivot will worsen the security
dilemma in U.S.-China relations. In this discussion, scholars address
and problematize U.S. increasing militarization of the Pacific and
high-profile displays of military alliances with countries surrounding
China.

Conclusion The chapter has argued that in most respects Chinese
diplomacy is more accepting of extant international institutions,
international norms (such as they are). and U.S dom-inance of the
international and regional power structure than at any time since 1949.
**[The most obvious and dangerous exception to this status-quo-ization
of Chinese diplomacy is the Taiwan issue]{.underline}**. Here China
reserves the right to use force to change the political and military
\'facts on the ground\'. in an effort to defend its symbolic claim to
\"name" the island of Taiwan. **[In an effort to stake this claim
Chinese leaders have taken military measures that have raised doubts
outside of China about the over-all status quo orientation of Chinese
power in the region.]{.underline}** These doubts have been magnified by
changes in political ideologies and definitions of interests in some key
capitals---Washington, Tokyo, and Taipei in particular. Their response,
in turn. have **[magnified doubts in Beijing that these three other
players will accept China\'s self-perceived legitimate intents on
questions of sovereignty and territorial integrit]{.underline}**y. The
militarization of security interactions among these four players,
**[this mutual construc-tion of adversarial image, is best explained by
security dilemma theory, not by some simplistic characterization of
Chinese revisionism or American hegemonism.]{.underline}** The limited
U.S.-Chinese counterterrorism cooperation after September is has not
changed these dynamics much. The tenor of Sino-U.S. relations improved
some-what after 9/11 as Chinese leaders realized that both countries
shared an interest in defending sovereign states against violent
nonsovereign state actors. There is, accord-ing to press reports, some
limited sharing of intelligence. In addition Chinese leaders were
helpfully low-keyed about Japan\'s unprecedented decision to send a
small naval force to assist the United States in the Arabian Sea. The
United States and China share an interest in seeing a multiethnic, more
or less secular, Afghanistan. China and the United States also have
every interest in seeing Pakistan survive as a unified, moderate Islamic
state. There has been relatively close coordination recently in try-ing
to convince die DPRK to abandon it nuclear weapons program. But
precisely because so much of the U.S. perception of other states\' level
of co-operativeness will be viewed through the 9/11 lens (for us or
against us), the potential for speeding up security dilemma dynamics,
perhaps even for transitioning China\'s interests into more overtly
revisionist ones, is there. If the United States al-lows states to
choose from a wide menu of actions in support of the war against
ter-rorism, then China can offer intelligence or assistance in tracking
the terrorists\' fi-nancial networks. These will be less demanding ten
of China\'s cooperation. A narrow menu of choice will be a tougher test,
one that nukes it more likely that China may "fail.\" In light of the
ongoing debate over the nature of Chinese power, a failure will have
added weight in determining that China is a fundamentally revi-sionist
state. A Chinese \"failure\" will also contrast sharply with my
Taiwanese sup-port for the U.S. war on terrorism, however symbolic that
support may be. Even though it does not appear to be along for any
explicit or short-term quid pro quo for cooperation thus far, **[the
Chinese leadership has to expect that the United States should become
more sympathetic to China\'s \"legitimate\" interests. Yet the U.S.
policies that worry the Chinese leadership most---arms sales to
Taiwan,]{.underline}** closer U.S.-Taiwan political and military
relations, National Missile Defense, the China-directed elements of U.S.
bilateral alliances in Asia, among others---are issues for which there
is strong support in Congress and the Pentagon. Domestic critics of any
strategy of cooperation with the United States will certainly be looking
for, even while not ex-pecting, U.S. concessions on these issues. The
absence any substantial U.S. overtures will be used as evidence of the
failure of a conciliatory approach to U.S. power. This leads to my next
point. It should be noted that the decline in revisionist in-terests in
China does not mean their elimination nor the impossibility of their
reap-pearance. For China, \"globalization\"---a headlong, relatively
unregulated, rush for short-term benefits under the rubric of the open
door policy---has created vast, income discrepancies. These can be
sustained with relatively high rates of absolute growth across
socioeconomic groups. But it is not hard to imagine social unrest
lead-ing to political preferences that are at odds with status quo
interest in the current economic \"division of labor\" within China and
between China and other states. **[China moved from being a
revolutionary \"revisionist\" state to a \"status quo" one in forty-odd
years.]{.underline}** It is not implausible that a more fundamental
\"revisionism\" might emerge from disillusionment with marketization, or
from problems of internal secession, or from the domestic effects of
Taiwan\'s gradual reconstruction as a U.S. ally in the containment of
China. Indeed, because of security dilemma dynamics and the negative
effects of unrestrained marketization, in retrospect we may see the
1980s and 1990s as a period of relative Chinese \"status quo-ness,\"
sandwiched by Maoist revi- sionism and some post-Jiang quasi-fascism.
This leads me to my final point. **[The security dilemma arguments may
best char-acterize the changing nature of the interaction between China,
the United States, Japan, and Taiwan is not a theoretical
breakthrough]{.underline}**. In the policy and punditry worlds, however,
this is a controversial argument because of the pervasiveness of
attribution errors in in-group worldviews. To argue in the policy world
for security dilemma explanation is to argue that all actors are more or
less status quo oriented or at least would prefer to minimize conflict
in the relationship, and that there is at least some moral equivalence
in the actions that promote tensions. This argument is po- litically
unacceptable in the U.S. government (even as, ironically, more and more
peo-ple are making it tentatively in the PRC). In the theory world, the
dynamics of security dilemmas are left fairly under- theorized. It is
assumed that they can be produced by two basic \"facts\"---states want
to maximize their security, and states operate under conditions of
uncertainty. But, in far these two assumptions are loaded theoretically,
and empirically often wrong. They are theoretically loaded because,
**[as Glaser and Wendt have pointed out from two war different
perspectives, there is nothing natural about a security
dilemma]{.underline}**. For Glaser it requires rational security
**[maximizing actors to believe that it is cheaper to achieve security
and to reduce uncertainty through an open-ended arms
buildup]{.underline}** rather than through the exploration of a
codifiable modus vivendi. Why they would believe this---why state
leaders would believe that security is more certain in an arms buildup
than in the search for ways to institutionalize the status quo---when
history suggests that often this belief is empirically wrong, speaks to
die question of why bad lessons are relearned by rational actors in IR.
That is, why are realpolitik lessons of var-ious stripes so persistent
when it is clear that only rarely does a truly revisionist state come
along? For Wendt a security dilemma requites the prior construction of a
Hobbesian or a Lockean culture of anarchy. Moreover, in dynamic is such
that it can create revisionist actors where there once were none.
Standard security dilemma the-ory assumes that the goals, desires, and
level of satisfaction of actors do not change much. Scholars speak of
security dilemmas of status quo stare (a stag hunt gone bad) or security
dilemmas of opportunist states (a prisoner dilemma). They do not tend to
talk about security dilemmas where the interaction shifts from stag hunt
interests to prisoner\'s dilemma interests or worse, deadlock interests
(in the latter case, the conflict is no longer a security dilemma. We
know that shifts can go in the other direction, as experiments in
iterated prisoner\'s dilemma play have Mown (Alker 996). **[Thus the
fact of a security dilemma, and the possibility of an intensifying one,
in Sino-U.S. relations requires an explanation, and it does not come
naturally from as-sumptions of fixed state interests and the inherent
uncertainty of anarchy.]{.underline}** This par-ticilar security
dilemma---its timing, and the issues that are most salient in propelling
it forward---have a lot to do with **[Taiwan\'s status in modern Chinese
nationalism, domestic developments in Taiwan, and Taiwan\'s place in
Sino-U.S. interactions over the last fifty years]{.underline}**. These
are ideational and historical factors that various stripes of re-alism
and an exclusively domestic-politics-focused theorizing do not have much
room for. We need, then, to theorize about the kinds of issues that are
salient in security dilemmas. In particular, does variation in these
issues explain variation in the intensity of a security dilemma? And to
what degree does the social history of a se-curity dilemma actually
change interests in a way that would not have happened ab-sent the
security dilemma? One might expect the literature on enduring rivalries
to help here. But it does not since it too posits a fixed-ness in state
interests through the entire history of the rivalry This is odd, since
**[presumably one of the reasons for an enduring rivalry is the
construction over time of images of self and other]{.underline}** (hence
definitions of the interests of self and others) **[that are dynamic,
not static. The China case suggests that the degree of dissatisfaction
may be in flux and may be related to the is-sue at the heart of this
particular dilemma]{.underline}**. This leads to an interesting
implication for security dilemma theorizing. I think in-ternational
relations theory typically considers a security dilemma as falling
within a **[defensive realist ontology]{.underline}**---it is, according
to this kind of realism, **[a real phenomenon of uncertainty under
anarchy when states are security seekers]{.underline}**. Thus, security
dilemmas are a reason for the reproduction of realpolitik practice and
this is why realists can be confidently ahistorical and a-cultural in
their claims about realpolitik practice. Anar-chy plus (more or less)
status quo states creates security dilemmas. Other realisms (of-fensive)
claim that the presence of revisionist or status quo states (the balance
of interests) is the source of realpolitik practice---revisionists
pursue realpolitik and status quo states have no rational choice but to
respond with realpolitik practice. But **[the emerging U.S.-Chinese
security dilemma suggests something a little different, syn-thesis of
these two realisms that only a socialization perspective can
understand]{.underline}**---namely, that **[security dilemmas can change
state interest]{.underline}**s in "hard realpolitik" directions. One
needs to think a bit more endogenously. 1That is security dilemmas
create features of a Hobbesian anarchy. Security dilemmas may be a
critical (though not the only source---ideology is clearly another) in
death, some kinds of non-status quo states. These states, in turn,
accentuate or sharpen the features of Hobbesian anarchy. Even Robert
Jervis, the most perceptive analyst of security dilemmas, strongly
implies that in security dilemmas interests remain fixed. There is no
security dilemma when one state is so dissatisfied with the status quo
that it is willing to risk survival to change it (an aggressor state).
But he does not suggest that security dilemmas can in fact create these
kinds of actors. It is necessary to view security dilemmas as social
interactions---socializing experiences---in order to understand this
change in funda-mental interests. **[Enduring rivalries are enduring
because the security dilemma features in the early interaction of these
actors creates mutual dissatisfaction with the status quo, hence a
willingness to take greater risks in trying to eliminate the other
rival]{.underline}**. Or put differently, the level (concessions
required to reassure become so great that no side is willing to make
them. **[Charles Glaser hints at the possibility of security dilemmas
creating more revisionist states out of less revisionist ones through a
process of increasing the adversary's "interest in
expansion]{.underline}**." This interest in turn is a function of a
growing perception that the first state is not a status quo state, but a
revisionst (or greedy) state. This perception can be formed by
particular kinds of military buildups by the first state, or by a
self-perception of oneself as clearly status quo oriented. Thus the
other side's buildup can only be aggressive, since one's own motives are
so clearly not a threat to the other side (Glaser 1997). **[This
captures some of the dynamics in the U.S.-China dilemma, but it does not
capture the question of changed interests]{.underline}**. True, U.S. and
Chinese decision makers, or important sectors of them, view the other as
aggressive because they view themselves as inherently peaceful or status
quo oriented. But adding to this dynamic is that the security dilemma
may be leading to an ideational devaluation of the payoffs from status
quo behavior in other areas in the relationship. In other words, there
is a spillover effect. The only major student of war in U.S. IR who
conceptualizes security dilemmas as socializing processes is John
Vasquez. But even Vasquez is ambivalent about whether security dilemmas
change preferences of actors, or change the political power of actors
with realpolitik preferences. He suggests the latter---that security
dilemmas create domestic conditions that are not conducive to the
victory of ideas for cooperative strategies. Hard-liners win out in the
marketplace of ideas. He does not address the possibility that
cooperators actually change their conceptualization of the adversary as
well. **[There is evidence this may be happening in the U.S.-China
case.]{.underline}** Engagers in the United States have not just been
under attack from primacists for being soft on China. But due to this
and Chinese behavior (for instance, in the EP-3 incident) some engagers
are rethinking their conceptions of Chinese intentions. Many propose now
with certainty that China wants to fundamentally alter the balance of
power in the Asia-Pacific, **[yet they cling to the notion that
engagement can perhaps constrain the pursuit of this goal. This creates
considerable tension in their arguments and probably weakens their
voices politically.]{.underline}** But there is nothing particularly
inevitable---certainly nothing inevitable derived from anarchy per
se---about security dilemmas. **[The U.S.-China security dilemma is in
large measure a function of the Taiwan question.]{.underline}** How can
one best understand the salience of Taiwan in this security dilemma? As
a function of specific and politically powerful claims about Chinese,
Taiwanese, and American identity: The political forces in these three
countries most active in supporting behavior that accentuates the
security dilemma are Chinese nationalists with a bias towards military
solutions, Taiwanese nationalists with a bias towards de jure
independence instead of satisfaction with de facto independence, and
American primacists who understand the world in power-transition terms.
This does not mean one should be overly optimistic about the ability of
"agents" to "construct" more peaceful and stable Sino-U.S. relations. I
try to avoid tea-leaf reading. But here I would agree with Aaron
Friedberg's pessimistic conclusion about the future of relations despite
the recent improved tenor in the post-9/11 world (Friedberg 2002). we
disagree about the reasons for this pessimism, however. **[His have to
do with the dominant ontology and epistemology that has helped create
the trope of a rising, dissatisfied China]{.underline}**---mentioned at
the start of the chapter---namely, **[an ontology and epistemology that
accepts that rising powers are inherently dissatisfied because the
"rules of the game]{.underline}**" (and the "distribution of power" that
reinforce them) are set by dominant powers. My pessimism comes from the
possibility that the level of dissatisfaction with the rules of the game
(to the extent these exist and are identifiable) can be rooted in issues
that are nonstructural, that have little to do with distributions of
power or rules of the game per se but have a lot to do with **[how the
concept of "rising powers are inherently dissatisfied" itself becomes a
lens through which these issues are analyzed]{.underline}**. In short,
the China case suggests that **[security dilemmas can turn nonstructural
conflicts into perceived structural ones:]{.underline}** the socializing
experience of **[security dilemmas consists of the amplification of
threats and threat perceptions such that one side begins to only look
for confirming evidence of the other's predisposition to
threaten]{.underline}**. The China-U.S. case suggests security dilemma
theory needs to go more micro, to abandon unitary rational-actor
assumptions, and look at the political, societal, and ideational
implications of treating others as adversaries. By combining the notion
of socialization and the possibility of endogenized changes in interests
with the concept of a security dilemma, we come to a better
understanding of the dynamics of Sino-U.S. relations in the post-Cold
War era by problematizing the notion of a "rising" China's
dissatisfaction with the "rules of the game."

#### arms sales to Taiwan perpetuate the construction of China as a threat

The \'\'China Threat\" Discourse and the New U.S. Containment Policy ¶
**[The discursive construction of the U.S. self and the \"Chinese
threat\" argument are not innocent, descriptive accounts of some
\"independent\" reality]{.underline}**. Rather, they are always a
clarion call for the practice of power politics. At the apex of this pow
is the politico-strategic question of \"what is to be done\" to make the
United States secure from the (perceived) threats it faces. At a general
level, as Benjamin Schwarz proposes, this requires an unhindered path to
U.S. global hegemony that means not only that the United States must
dominate wealthy and technologically sophisticated states in Europe and
East Asia - America\'s \"allies\" - but also that it must deal with such
nuisances as Saddam Hussein, Slobodan Milosevic and Kim Jong II, so that
potential great powers need not acquire the means to deal with those
problems themselves. And those powers that eschew Amer- ican
supervision - such as China - must be both engaged and contained. The
upshot of \"American leadership\" is that the United States must spend
nearly as much on national security as the rest of the world combined.67
¶ **[This \"neocontainment\" policy has been echoed in the \"China
threat\" literature]{.underline}**. In a short yet decisive article
titled \"Why We Must Contain China,\" Washington Post columnist Charles
Krautham- mer insists that **[\"containing China\" and \"undermining its
ruthless dictatorship\" constitute two essential components of \"any
rational policy toward a rising, threatening China.\"]{.underline}** Not
only is a policy other than containment considered irrational, but even
a delay to implement it would be undesirable, as he urges that
\"containment of such a bully must begin early in its career.\" To this
end, Kraut- hammer offers such \"practical\" options as strengthening
regional alliances (with Vietnam, India, and Russia, as well as Japan)
to box in China; standing by Chinese dissidents; denying Beijing the
right to host the Olympics; and keeping China from joining the World
Trade Organization on the terms it desires.68 ¶ **[Containing China is
of course not the only option arising from the \"China threat\"
literature. More often than not, there is a sub- tle, business-style
\"crisis management\" policy]{.underline}**. For example, Bern- stein
and Munro shy away from the word containment, **[preferring to call
their China policy management]{.underline}**.69 Yet, what remains
unchanged in the management formula is a continued promotion of control-
ling China. For instance, a perusal of Bernstein and Munro\'s texts
reveals that what they mean by management is no different than
Krauthammer\'s explicit containment stance.70 **[By framing U.S.- China
relations as an issue of \"crisis management,\" they leave little doubt
of who is the \"manager\" and who is to be \"managed.\"]{.underline}**
In a more straightforward manner, Betts and Christensen state that
coercion and war must be part and parcel of the China manage- ment
policy: ¶ In addressing the China challenge, the United States needs to
think hard about three related questions: first, how to avoid crises and
war through prudent, coercive diplomacy; second, how to manage crises
and fight a war if the avoidance effort fails; third, how to end crises
and terminate war at costs acceptable to the United States and its
allies.71 ¶ This is not to imply that the kind of perspectives outlined
above will automatically be translated into actual China policy**[, but
one does not have to be exceedingly perceptive to note that the \"China
threat\" perspective does exert enormous influence on U.S. policy making
on China]{.underline}**. To illustrate this point, I want now to examine
some **[specific implications of U.S. representations of the \"China
threat\" for U.S.-China relations in relation to the 1995-1996 Taiwan
Strait missile crisi]{.underline}**s and the \"spy plane\" incident of
2001. ¶ Theory as Practice 1: **[The Taiwan Strait Missile Crisis ¶ In
the eyes of many U.S. China watchers, China\'s approach to the Taiwan
question is a microcosm of its grand strategy to dominate
Asia.]{.underline}** The argument is that nowhere is the threatening
ambition more palpable than in China\'s saber-rattling missile tests
near Tai- wan\'s coast in 1995-1996, in addition to its long-standing
refusal to renounce the use of force as a last resort to settle the
dispute.72 While the 1995-1996 missile crisis has been a favorite
\"starting point\" for many pundits and practitioners to paint a
frightening pic- ture of China and to justify U.S. firm response to it,
what is often conveniently overlooked is the question of how the \"China
threat\" discourse itself had played a constitutive role in the lead-up
to that crisis. Limits of space forbid exploring this complex issue
here. Sim- ply put, the Taiwan question was created largely as a result
of wide- spread U.S. perceptions of China as a \"Red Menace\" in the
wake of the \"loss of China\" and the outbreak of the Korean War. To
thwart what it saw as an orchestrated Communist offensive in Asia, the
United States deployed the U.S. Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait as
part of its Cold War containment strategy, thereby effectively pre-
venting the reunification of Taiwan with mainland China. While the
United States abandoned its containment and isolation policy toward
China in the 1970s and the two countries established full diplomatic
relations in 1979, the conventional image of the \"Red Menace\" lingered
on in the United States. **[To manage such a \"threat,\" the U.S.
Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act shortly after the normalization
of U.S.-China relations, renewing U.S. com- mitment to Taiwan\'s defense
even though diplomatic ties with the island had been severed.73
¶]{.underline}** This confrontational policy **[serves not only to shore
up Taiwan\'s defense capabilities but also to induce its independent
ambition and further complicate cross-strait relations]{.underline}**.
As former U.S. defense official Chas Freeman remarked, \"**[U.S. arms
sales to Taiwan]{.underline}** **[no longer work to boost Taipei\'s
confidence that it can work out its dif- ferences with Beijing. Instead,
they bolster the view that Taiwan can go its own way.]{.underline}**\"74
For instance, amid growing sympathy from the Republican-dominated
Congress and the elite media as well as the expanded ties with the
United States, Taiwan responded coolly to Beijing\'s call for dialogue
in January 1995. In June 1995, Taiwan\'s flexible diplomacy, designed to
burnish its independent image, cul- minated in its president Lee
Teng-hui\'s high-profile visit to the United States. This in turn
reinforced Beijing\'s suspicion that the real U.S. intention was to
frustrate its reunification goal, leaving it apparently no other choice
but to prepare militarily for what it saw as a worst-case scenario. All
this constituted the major context in which the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait
missile exercises took place. For most Chinese, the carrying out of
these military exercises, well within their own territory, had little to
do with attacking Tai- wan, much less with challenging U.S. security
interests in the west- ern Pacific. Rather, it was about China\'s
long-cherished dream of national unity, with its \"sabre rattling\"
tactics serving merely as a warning to the United States, as well as to
Taiwan. However, inter- preting such exercises as China\'s
muscle-flexing with direct security implications for the region, with
\"an almost 19th-century display of gunboat diplomacy,\"75 the United
States dispatched two nuclear- powered aircraft carriers to the region
of Taiwan. ¶ While not denying the potential security repercussions of
China\'s missile tests for the region, I suggest that **[the flashpoint
of Taiwan says as much about the danger of this U.S. approach to China
as about the threat of Beijing\'s display of force
itself.]{.underline}** \"Had Bill Clinton projected a constancy of
purpose and vision in China policy \... in 1993-1994,\" David M. Lampton
argues, \"he might not have been challenged in the Taiwan Strait in
1995-1996 with missile exercises.\"76 Indeed, it was primarily in the
context of this U.S. intervention that Zhongguo keyi shuo bu (China can
say no), one of the most anti-U.S. books ever produced in China, emerged
and quickly became a best-seller in the Chinese reading world.77 Mean-
while, some Chinese strategic thinkers were so alarmed by the U.S. show
of strength that they told Helmut Sonnenfeldt, one of Henry Kissinger\'s
close associates, that they were rereading the early works of George F.
Kennan because \"containment had been the basis of American policy
toward the Soviet Union; now that the United States was turning
containment against China, they wanted to learn how it had started and
evolved.\"78 ¶ If such a scary interaction between the United States and
China remained somehow obscured here, it would soon be manifested again
in another standoff in U.S.-China relations; namely, the spy- plane
incident of 2001.

### 2AC/1AR China = Defensive Realist

#### China's island posturing exemplifies *[defensive realism]{.underline}* -- fully understanding their intentions is impossible, but our use of concrete examples solves the downfalls of Western securitization

Sea conflict", European Journal of International Relations, 2018,
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1354066118780996)//RCU

In the following sections, we argue that **[historical analogies from
China's recent past suggest that conflicts over islands can be
interpreted as parts of a strategy of border maintenance]{.underline}**.
That is to say, **[they are best seen as fundamentally symbolic acts to
send diplomatic, albeit aggressive, messages seeking recognition of some
underlying change]{.underline}** in the status quo **[that China
considers advantageous to its interests. The argument]{.underline}** we
make **[is not that the examples introduced]{.underline}** in the
following necessarily **[offer the "right" readings of
China's]{.underline}** strategic **[objectives]{.underline}** today,
**[but that ignoring them as plausible interpretations of what takes
place in the South China Sea deprives Western policymakers of rich
historical resources through which relations with China could be
carefully navigated to reduce the chances of conflict.]{.underline}**
There is all the more reason to discuss these interpretations as they
form part of China's own historical legacy and interaction with the West
in the 20th century. Put differently, **[while Western experiences talk
and resonate to a Western audience]{.underline}**17 and hence their use
in the West is of little surprise, from an analytical perspective, **[it
is imperative to consider Chinese experiences in order to avoid the most
unfortunate of affairs]{.underline}**: **[for the West to exacerbate the
conflict by imposing its]{.underline}** prevailing **[security
imaginary]{.underline}** in its relations with China, an imaginary
**[that may be at odds with China's own]{.underline}** perspectives and
**[motivations]{.underline}** regarding the island conflicts.

China's dealing with disputed islands: **[Two historical
examples]{.underline}**

If we'd occupied the islands, we would have lost the ability to cause
him \[Chiang Kai-shek\] discomfort any time we want. (Mao, quoted in,
e.g., Gurtov, 1976: 93)

The fixation on avoiding appeasement discussed in the previous section
appears somewhat paradoxical when we look at Xi Jinping's (quoted in
China Daily, 2015) claim that "there is no such thing as the so-called
Thucydides trap in the world. But should major countries time and again
make the mistakes of strategic miscalculation, they might create such
traps for themselves." Of course, this statement does not, in itself,
prove anything about China's alleged pacifism when it comes to the South
China Sea conflicts. In order **[to argue that there is an alternative
reading of China's dealings with]{.underline}** its **[surrounding
islands]{.underline}** that differs from the previously discussed
analogies, **[we present two examples from China's past experiences with
the islands at its borders]{.underline}**. We suggest that these
examples offer possible alternative analogies for grasping the meaning
attached to the islands and the strategic objectives that guide China.
What **[these analogies share]{.underline}** is **[the insight that
China might not be aiming for "conquest," but rather that conflict over
islands is just a mechanism for diplomatic signaling and should not be
interpreted as]{.underline}** the first step in **[an expansionist
military agenda]{.underline}**. **[The first example is the 1954--1958
Taiwan crises in which Mao bombarded some]{.underline}** of the
**[offshore islands]{.underline}**. Crucially for our purposes, **[the
point]{.underline}** of doing so **[was not for the PRC to occupy
them]{.underline}**, let alone initiate an expansive military campaign.
By the same token, **[our second example is the 1969 Sino-Soviet border
conflict at Zhenbao Island, in which skirmishes initiated]{.underline}**
primarily **[by Chinese troops]{.underline}** at the border **[did not
indicate]{.underline}** the first phase of a **[war against the Soviet
Union, but were]{.underline}** instead **[intended to send a diplomatic
signal for]{.underline}** various **[political reasons.]{.underline}**
Nevertheless, as we will show, the risks of strategic miscalculation and
military escalation were serious in both cases, which should alert us
all the more to the importance of tactful international diplomacy.

### \-\--Taiwan 

#### Taiwan and the SCS are two sides of the same coin -- their actions are *[defensive]{.underline}* and deeply tied to the desire for unifcation

**Raditio, 19** -- Klaus Heinrich Raditio received his PhD from the
University of Sydney researching on China and the South China Sea. His
Masters of Law in International Relations was awarded by Tsinghua
University, Beijing. (KLAUS HEINRICH, "Understanding China's Behaviour

4.1.4 Taiwan **[Taiwan is of great significance to China]{.underline}**
in many aspects. **[General]{.underline}** Douglas **[MacArthur
perceived Taiwan as "an unsinkable aircraft carrier"]{.underline}** from
which external powers can project their forces along China's maritime
boundary.64 Taiwan's strategic position also enables outside powers to
execute a strategic containment against China. **[The island served the
US intelligence operations against the]{.underline}** People's Republic
of China (**[PRC]{.underline}**) during the Cold War, **[which
underlines how insecure China can be if Taiwan is dominated by a rival
power]{.underline}**. The failure to control Taiwan will be detrimental
to China's ambition of dominating its near seas and becoming a global
sea power.65 **[Beijing has asserted that Taiwan is one of its core
interests]{.underline}**---**[which means it will not tolerate its
independence]{.underline}** from the PRC. Beijing is unsatisfied with
the status quo and is trying to change it in its favour. To accomplish
this, China must dominate the SCS. **[The relationship between Taiwan
and the SCS is]{.underline}** like **[two sides of a
coin]{.underline}**---**[China needs to control Taiwan to break the
containment in the first island chain]{.underline}**. Concomitantly,
**[China also needs to dominate the SCS to ensure Taiwan's return to the
mainland]{.underline}**. Securing of the first island chain, which is
demarcated by an imaginary line stretching from southernmost Japan,
Taiwan, and the Philippines is China's priority. If China cannot control
Taiwan than it cannot realise its ambition to rule the seas within the
first island chain, which are the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, and
the SCS. According to Lin Sixing, a professor at Jinan University, the
fall of Taiwan to external forces means two things: first, there is no
security for the southeastern Chinese coastal region; second, China is
denied access to the Pacific.66 China will be permanently restrained
within the first island chain, and it will lose the opportunity to
realise its ambition to be a sea power.67 The first island chain serves
both as a defensive stronghold and as an offensive projection of China's
power, a posture which is meant to tackle two main challenges.68 The
first is resisting invasion from the maritime boundary with an advanced
maritime defence system, including nuclear arsenals. The second is
securing the maritime routes and maritime interest in far seas. To cope
with the latter, China's strategy should include "offshore defence",
"near seas defence", and "far seas defence" simultaneously.69 In other
words, **[China's maritime strategy cannot be properly executed as long
as Taiwan is not under Beijing's full control. Moreover, since Taiwan is
a core interest, China cannot exert its control over it if Beijing does
not have significant power in the SCS]{.underline}**. The strategy in
the SCS that China needs to apply to prevent Taiwan's independence is
sea denial. Sea denial is a strategy to create the SCS as a no-go zone
for external powers, especially the US. China is uneasy with the US
military operations in the SCS for various reasons. First, it sees the
US military activities as an intelligence operation to collect data on
China's nuclear submarine base in Yulin, Hainan. Second, China also sees
these US activities as a means of containment. Third, **[since the US is
bound by the Taiwan Relations Act to resist]{.underline}** any form of
**[coercion that threatens Taiwan security]{.underline}**, the **[US
military activity in the SCS is seen]{.underline}** by Beijing **[as an
impediment to realising its unification with the
mainland]{.underline}**. Thus, **[China perceives that limiting access
to US military activity in the SCS is crucial to distance Taiwan from
the US and therefore increase the possibility for the mainland to
reunify the island]{.underline}**.70 China perceives Taiwan as its
legitimate territory and this position is shared by most states
including the US. Taiwanese reunification is also a priority in China's
defence and diplomatic agenda. **[From this point of view, securing the
SCS and Taiwanese reunification are inseparable]{.underline}**. **[If
China dominates the SCS, it will be one step ahead in bringing back
Taiwan. On the other hand, if Taiwan is reunified with China, this also
helps China to gain control of the SCS]{.underline}**. Hence, **[from
this perspective China's interest in the SCS is not
offensive]{.underline}**.

### \-\--Contain = Offensive

#### China is *[defensive realist]{.underline}* -- compliance with the Tribunal ruling, de-escalation in the SCS, and self-defeating prophecy -- but, American containment allows for *[offensive circumstances]{.underline}*

**Raditio, 19** -- Klaus Heinrich Raditio received his PhD from the
University of Sydney researching on China and the South China Sea. His
Masters of Law in International Relations was awarded by Tsinghua
University, Beijing. (KLAUS HEINRICH, "Understanding China's Behaviour
in the South China Sea: A Defensive Realist Perspective", Palgrave
MacMillan, <https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-13-1283-0>, 2019)//RCU

In the aftermath of the Tribunal ruling, China shows a reversal from its
offensive realism in two aspects. First is the new wording of its
statement of claim in the SCS as explained in Chap. 3. Second, **[China
granted access to]{.underline}** the **[Philippine fishermen to the
Scarborough Shoal after]{.underline}** the Philippine President Rodrigo
**[Duterte]{.underline}** (who started his term in 30 June 2016)
**[travelled to China]{.underline}**. **[These moves demonstrate that
the UNCLOS Tribunal ruling has a constraining effect on China's
behaviour]{.underline}** to some extent. China's future behaviour in the
SCS depends on a combination of domestic and international factors. In
brief, domestic factors (leadership rivalry, the sense of
exceptionalism, and victimhood) tend to propel China to act in an
offensive realist manner as was evident in the 2012 Scarborough Shoal
incident and the 2014--2015 massive construction of artificial islands.
**[China's behaviour]{.underline}** also **[depends on international
factors such as the US balancing activities against
China]{.underline}**. **[Since the Chinese leadership is aware
of]{.underline}** some **[regional countries' support for the
US]{.underline}** role, **[China is unlikely to adopt an offensive
realist approach]{.underline}** against the US. However, **[the nature
of the defensive realism]{.underline}** world which is **[supported by
the prevalence of international law tends to motivate China to adopt a
defensive realist strategy]{.underline}**. 8.2 Significance for Theory
and Policy **[The main findings]{.underline}** of this thesis **[show
strong support for defensive realism theory]{.underline}**. **[During
the period of de-escalation]{.underline}** (**[1995 until]{.underline}**
between 2007 and **[2009]{.underline}**), **[China had the most advanced
military power]{.underline}** compared to other SCS claimants.
**[However, instead of using force, China extended]{.underline}** its
**[cooperative behaviour]{.underline}** which was successful **[in
de-escalating the SCS]{.underline}** tension. **[China
demonstrated]{.underline}** its **[serious commitment to stabilising the
region by participating in]{.underline}** several multilateral
agreements: **[the 2002 DoC, the ASEAN TAC]{.underline}** in 2003,
**[and the JMSU]{.underline}** in 2005. **[This]{.underline}** fact
**[is at odds with the offensive realism assumption that suggests China
will pursue hegemonic ambition to resolve its dispute]{.underline}**
with other claimants.1 Furthermore, the development of the SCS tension
corresponds to the security dilemma continuum. Mounting evidence shows
that **[instead of pre-meditated actions, the development of the SCS
security dilemma is a result of uncertainty and inadvertency between
China and other claimant states]{.underline}**. **[The same applies to
the tension between China and the US]{.underline}** in the SCS.
Uncertainty is one of the key concepts of defensive realism.2 **[In
contrast, offensive realism suggests that all states aim at power
maximisation and regional hegemony]{.underline}**, **[which creates much
less uncertainty]{.underline}**.3 **[This]{.underline}** assumption
**[cannot stand before the reality of the states concerned in the
SCS]{.underline}**. Evidence in this research also suggests that
**[China is experiencing a selfdefeating phenomenon]{.underline}**.
Self-defeating behaviour is one of the basic tenets of defensive realism
which suggests that a state's attempt to enhance its power does not
necessarily lead to its increased security. **[This is particularly
apparent in]{.underline}** the case of China's Yulin naval base and the
US surveillance activities. **[China's building of the Yulin naval base
in Hainan Island]{.underline}** is **[driven by defensive
motivation]{.underline}**. However, **[this has raised concerns for the
US since the base can be used to launch a nuclear
submarine]{.underline}**, which in turn threatens US naval ships in the
region, **[leading to the growing frequency of
surveillance]{.underline}** and intelligence gathering on flights and
ships, **[which is perceived by China as a threat by the
US.]{.underline}** Having confirmed the nature of China's defensive
realist behaviour in the SCS, this research concludes that China has
defected to offensive realism. Chinese defection behaviours show that a
state could change from one form of realist strategy to the other. By
contrast, offensive realism argues that all states are offensive realist
and offensive realism is the only strategy to guarantee a state's
survival. This presupposition is not in alignment with China's SCS
behaviour. With regard to China's relations with the US in the SCS, this
research finds that China's involvement in the US-led rim of the Pacific
(RIMPAC) since 2014 dismisses the offensive realist argument that China
will expel the US from the first and second island chains. **[Offensive
realism cannot explain China's participation in enhancing the US-led
maritime order in the Pacific]{.underline}**. However, according to
defensive realism, it is logical for China to accept the existing US-led
order. **[In terms of policy]{.underline}**, this research suggests that
**[China should be given the opportunity to reverse its policy towards
other claimants to defensive realism]{.underline}**. **[Dealing with
China using the offensive realism perspective will not]{.underline}**
help to **[stabilise the region]{.underline}**. Evidence shows that
**[China is fundamentally a defensive realist state. However, it can
adopt offensive realist measures under some
circumstances]{.underline}**. This research finds that domestic factors,
that is, political rivalry within the CCP's leadership, plays a
significant role in China's offensive realist behaviour. In addition,
**[the Chinese]{.underline}** population and its
**[leadership]{.underline}** maintain a sense of exceptionalism and
superiority towards other countries. This means that they **[are very
sensitive about their own reputation and dignity]{.underline}**
(mianzi). **[China's sensitivity]{.underline}** about its dignity
**[should be accommodated politically]{.underline}** but not legally.
The rapprochement initiative by the newly installed Philippine President
Rodrigo Duterte has proved to be effective in de-escalating the SCS
tension. However, the Philippines should not withdraw its submission to
the UNCLOS Tribunal or undermine the tribunal ruling on 12 July 2016.
This ruling has given legal certainty on a maritime rights dispute in
the SCS and the future of the SCS should be shaped based on the ruling
of the UNCLOS Tribunal.

### \-\--SCS

#### China's *[defensive realist]{.underline}* -- behavior in the SCS goes *[our]{.underline}* way

**Slenter, 18** -- Fleur Slenter is a recent graduate of the MA
International Relations with a specialization in Global Order in

Previously, she studied at Maastricht University, obtaining a BA in
European Studies. She took part in the ERASMUS+ programme at Essex

**[Throughout its white papers, China reaffirms its commitment to a
peaceful and stable region]{.underline}**. **[The country strongly
believes in cooperation with other actors]{.underline}** involved **[in
the area]{.underline}**. Indeed, it is a shared responsibility to keep
the region peaceful and stable, and it should be kept this way through
dialogue, negotiations and other peaceful means. **[Throughout these
statements flows a defensive realist narrative]{.underline}** that is
**[committed to keep the status quo and balance together with other
states]{.underline}**. Furthermore, **[peaceful means are prioritized
above aggressive ones]{.underline}**. Nevertheless, when other countries
provoke China and overstep territorial boundaries, international and
judicial tools are deemed irrelevant. The country thereby implies that a
breach in its security will be matched in response. The proportion or
the means of this response is unclear, yet it clearly implies that China
will defend itself however possible. **[If its security is breached, it
will consider all options, or so it signals to potential provocative
states. Although the tone is more aggressive, it still pursues security
and not power]{.underline}**. It does not seek expansion of power in its
statements. Indeed, it is seen in practice that when China clashes with
another country it is clear on the boundaries of its territory and that
its neighbours are not welcome within them. Nevertheless, it is also
clear that **[while China is rather aggressive in]{.underline}** such
**[instances]{.underline}**, **[it does not take the opportunity to
escalate]{.underline}** the situation. **[It does not conquer additional
territory and]{.underline}** it **[does not send its fleet to attack the
neighbouring country]{.underline}**. Nevertheless, one must remain
critical. If its statements would be aggressive and violent, its
neighbouring countries would oppose China together. Furthermore, they
would not cooperate and leverage would be little. One should expect that
the statements do not fully match China's intentions. A country will
never fully enclose its interests and intensions. This is where its
actual behaviour on the waters of the South China Sea fill in certain
gaps. China claims the majority of the South China Sea to be theirs and
acts upon it when foreign vessels infringe upon their claimed
sovereignty. In its statements, however, it seems to forget its own
possibly provocative behaviour. Indeed, it built military capabilities
on disputed islands, and expanded them by dredging islands in disputed
areas to strengthen its claim. When other countries do this, it is
classified as provocative. In public, China keeps the narrative running
that it wants to built mutual beneficial relationships with its
neighbours, yet out on the sea one could argue that its behaviour is at
times more befitting offensive realism. Should we then disconnect
strengthening military capabilities and building islands from offensive
behaviours? China has claimed the territories in which it has been
building islands for the past few years. Its neighbouring countries,
although in a lesser capacity, have done the same. China has been
consistent by defending the territory it claims. **[Having many
countries in the area that cannot be considered allies]{.underline}**,
as well as their backing by the US, **[it is rational behaviour to
strengthen military capabilities]{.underline}** when this is possible
**[and defend ones own territory when this is necessary]{.underline}**.
To consider the opposite, China has not used any military capabilities
aggressively outside the territories it lays claim to. Furthermore, it
responds to other countries in a consistent manner. **[It does so by
clearly stating what they believe their territory is and by actively
defending it]{.underline}**. The country thereby does not take the
opportunity to escalate. Rather, it remains open to possible solutions
that are agreeable for all parties involved. Some observers argue that
the current behaviour of China, being cooperative and more cautious of
escalation, presenting itself to be willing to work on solutions on fora
such as ASEAN, is simply a phase. They argue that China is taking its
time to grow economically, and to build ways to make other countries
dependant on it for loans and trade. Furthermore, they argue that China
is taking its time to strengthen and expand its military. China has been
developing and building new weapons, ships and other material to expand
its military capabilities. Indeed, in this they all find arguments that
this perceived defensive behaviour is solely a smokescreen for what
happens next. Nevertheless, the analysis cannot know what happens next.
We are unable to predict the future. The author can only say that it is
fairly possible that China continues to behave the way it does. However,
it might also be possible it does not. The future is a whole other
research question. One that cannot be examined at the moment, but simply
when the future is at present. 5. Conclusion This thesis has examined
China's behaviour in the South China Sea. The research question was the
following. To what extent can Chinese activity in the South China Sea be
explained by both offensive and defensive realism? It has thereby aimed
to remain critical of the motivations of this behaviour, through
employing both theories that regard behaviour in a different manner.
These lenses have been employed on the domestic politics, the 9 dash
line and the activities on and around the islands in question. China's
attempts to accomplish peaceful settlements have thereby taken into
account. By doing so **[this thesis has found that China's behaviour is
largely defensive]{.underline}**. It is clear that China does not allow
others to question its territory even if it is disputed and claimed by
others as well. **[All territory China claimed to be theirs is fiercely
protected. It has done so for decades. Nevertheless, it has been open to
solutions and]{.underline}** has **[remained cautious in situations that
had the possibility to escalate, and]{.underline}** thereby
**[repeatedly prevented potential war]{.underline}**. Indeed, in any
situation that could escalated it clearly stated it wishes not to and
seek solutions that would be suitable for all parties involved. **[China
has preferred to do this through bilateral channels]{.underline}**,
which is more characteristic for offensive countries, as they then have
the ability to be dominant and intimidating. Indeed, China has not been
very keen on intense cooperation with ASEAN, however it did on multiple
occasions accept the opportunity to do so. It must be remembered that in
the ASEAN forum, it is China against a whole group of other countries,
which are often backed by the US. The latter country often gets itself
involved in the region, strengthening military alliances with
neighbouring countries of China and at times even actively proclaiming
that is does not agree with what China is doing, especially with regards
to the South China Sea. One might be sceptical due to **[China's
assertive responses to other countries coming into disputed
territory]{.underline}**. However, this **[is in line with defensive
realism, which holds that a country will always try to protect itself.
This includes other countries invading their territory
and]{.underline}** thereby **[disrespecting their sovereignty, albeit in
territory that is claimed by others as well]{.underline}**.

#### China has a historical basis for their SCS claims -- they're not an offensive realist

**Raditio, 19** -- Klaus Heinrich Raditio received his PhD from the
University of Sydney researching on China and the South China Sea. His
Masters of Law in International Relations was awarded by Tsinghua
University, Beijing. (KLAUS HEINRICH, "Understanding China's Behaviour

MacMillan, <https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-13-1283-0>, 2019)//RCU

This chapter highlighted the importance of a territorial or
jurisdictional claim (or both) in deciding whether a country is an
expansionist or not. **[If a country, because of its growing power,
harbours an ambition to conquer a territory for which this has no
historical or legal basis, then it should be considered
expansionist]{.underline}**. This chapter finds that **[China's SCS
claim precedes the founding of the PRC and]{.underline}** thus **[is not
directly due to its rising power]{.underline}**. **[China has strong
links with the SCS and has grounds to dispute its rights in
it.]{.underline}** Even though China has the right to dispute its rights
in the SCS, in terms of exercising sovereignty according to
international law, its claim is not indisputable. Its activities, as
well as those of other claimants, have been sporadic and inconsistent.

Theoretically, the above points show that **[China is not an offensive
realist nor expansionist]{.underline}**. **[An offensive realist seeks
to maximise]{.underline}** its **[power by conquest]{.underline}** and
expansion.74 This position resembles that of Nazi Germany. However, the
**[behaviour of China in the SCS is a far cry from that of Nazi
Germany]{.underline}**.75 **[Germany had no right to dispute the
territory it invaded]{.underline}** in the World War II
**[and]{.underline}** its claim over the newly occupied territory was
purely based on military conquest. Furthermore, Germany **[had no strong
historical presence to the invaded territory.]{.underline}** In
contrast, China has had a strong historical presence in the SCS and has
inherited the territorial claim from the previous regime. As such, **[a
country like PRC]{.underline}**---**[which has]{.underline}** had **[a
strong historical presence in the SCS and]{.underline}** has
**[inherited the claim from the previous
regime]{.underline}**---**[cannot be characterised as]{.underline}**
that of **[an offensive realist or expansionist.]{.underline}**

#### China's SCS expansion isn't for global domination, it's for *[oil]{.underline}* and *[fish]{.underline}*

**Raditio, 19** -- Klaus Heinrich Raditio received his PhD from the
University of Sydney researching on China and the South China Sea. His
Masters of Law in International Relations was awarded by Tsinghua
University, Beijing. (KLAUS HEINRICH, "Understanding China's Behaviour

**[The presence of natural resources, primarily hydrocarbons and
fisheries, is undoubtedly a factor, contributing to the strategic
importance of the SCS]{.underline}**. However, the strategic value of
these resources depends on their exact extent, their ease of recovery,
and their direct significance to China's (or any other proximal
nation's) needs. In China, coal is the primary energy source, accounting
for about 70% of total energy consumption. However, oil and gas are also
important. In 1993, China became a net oil importer when its crude oil
imports exceeded its export. By 1996, China was experiencing a decrease
in oil production and the demand growth was 5.8% annually, compared to
output growth of 2.8%.1 **[The I]{.underline}**nternational
**[E]{.underline}**nergy **[A]{.underline}**gency **[predicted that by
2030, China would supersede the US as the biggest consumer of
oil]{.underline}**, and its gas market would be bigger than the
countries of the European Union combined.2 China became a net importer
of natural gas in 2007, and the demand for such imports is expected to
rise significantly after 2020.3 **[The growth of its population and its
modernisation agenda will render energy and food]{.underline}**
resources (**[including]{.underline}** fish and
**[seafood]{.underline}**) **[as important for China's sustainable
development]{.underline}**. The US Energy Information Administration
estimates that **[within the SCS there can be found 11 billion
barrels]{.underline}** (1.7 billion tonnes) **[of oil and 190 trillion
cubic feet]{.underline}** (5.4 trillion cubic metres)
**[of]{.underline}** natural gas **[hydrocarbon
reserves]{.underline}**.4 **[China's Ministry]{.underline}** of Land and
Resources **[has more optimistic data]{.underline}**, calculating 23--30
billion tonnes of petroleum resources and 16 trillion cubic metres of
natural gas deposits within the nine-dash line. **[This latter estimate
would mean the total hydrocarbon deposits in the SCS comprise one-third
of China's total oil and gas resources and account for 12% of global
hydrocarbon resources]{.underline}**.5 In brief, there is a considerable
gap regarding the estimation of the hydrocarbon resources between China
and other countries. Accordingly, the SCS should not be considered
simply as having the potential to provide a panacea for China's energy
security problem for at least two reasons. First, it is important to
distinguish between resources and reserves. A resource estimate
indicates the whole quantity of hydrocarbons on site. Reserves are an
element of the resources that may be extractable at the actual market
price. It has been suggested that the recovery factor for the SCS is
10%---which is lower than the conventional rate of 35%---while the
recovery factor for natural gas is assessed to be about 75%.6 The
hydrocarbon resources in the SCS can only help to alleviate China's
energy security problem if it is assessed in terms of production,
instead of the quantity of resources on site. Second, China's energy
security challenge should focus more on managing domestic demand, that
is, increasing its efficiency and encouraging energy conservation.7 The
capacity of the SCS reserves in compensating for the gap between
expected demand and supply is insignificant. It is misleading to posit
that the hydrocarbon reserves in the SCS could alleviate energy security
issues in China or any claimant state.8 **[In terms of fishery
resources, the SCS represents 12% of the world's fish
catch]{.underline}**, and this resource keeps depleting.9 **[China's
fish consumption grew annually at 6%]{.underline}** from 1990 to 2010,
**[and its population consumes 34% of the world's fish food
supply]{.underline}**---almost three times that of Central Asia and
Europe combined and over five times that of North America.10 According
to the World Bank's estimation, China's fish consumption per capita will
reach 41 kg by 2030---which is more than double world's average.11
**[The majority of maritime fishing activities]{.underline}**
(**[78%]{.underline}**) **[take place in China's disputed
waters]{.underline}**, including the SCS.12 Moreover, **[about 15
million people work in the Chinese fishery industry]{.underline}**.13
**[This makes China's effort to secure its purported "traditional
fishing ground" for]{.underline}** its **[fishermen extremely
urgent.]{.underline}**

### \-\--Arctic

#### China's "lay-low" behavior in the *[Arctic]{.underline}* proves it has no global aims -- if it did, they would be equally aggressive in the North

**Ng, 18** -- Ph.D. in Politics and International Relations from the
University of Queensland and Professor, Faculty of International Studies
and Regional Development, University of Niigata Prefecture; citing Leng
Tse-kang, Research Fellow of Institute of Political Science of Academia
Sinica (IPSAS) and Professor of Political Science at National Chengchi
University, Taipei, Taiwan. Professor Leng received his Ph.D. in
Government and Foreign Affairs from the University of Virginia in 1995.
Dr. Leng was a Professor and Chair of Political Science Department of
National Chengchi University. He served as Section Chief of R & D Office
, and Research Fellow of Institute of International Relations at
National Chengchi University. (Ka Po, "Decoding the rise of China:
Taiwanese and Japanese perspectives", Journal of Contemporary East Asia
Studies, 10/23/2018,
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24761028.2018.1535295)//RCU

The last chapter by Leng Tse-kang serves to compensate for the
deficiency in existing discussion of Chinese geopolitics. **[The shift
of attention to the Arctic reflects China's changing global views and
its adoption of a proactive foreign policy]{.underline}**. **[The
aspiration to pursue "relational governance" and the need for energy
resources to fuel economic growth]{.underline}** all **[point to the
north. In that region]{.underline}**, **[China takes a stance in stark
contrast to its behavior in both the E]{.underline}**ast China Sea
**[and]{.underline}** the **[S]{.underline}**outh
**[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea, **[urging cooperation and
observation of international norms and laws]{.underline}**. This thus
far fails to allay suspicions of Artic countries. Leng, however, argues
that **[Chinese Arctic diplomacy has not deviated from the course of
"lay-low" policy and is far from any hint of pursuing
hegemony]{.underline}**. On the contrary, he suggests, **[it will
promote their image as a "law-abiding" member of the international
community]{.underline}**. Successful exploitation of Arctic policy to
overcome suspicion of China rise will facilitate smooth transition of
Chinese diplomacy.

### SCS No Link

#### Link turn -- the aff is a recognition that SCS behavior isn't *[aggression]{.underline}*, but *[responsive]{.underline}* to the West

**Johnson, 18** -- Honorary Fellow in the School of History, Politics
and International Relations at the University of Leicester (James,
"Conceptualizing the United States--China Security Dilemma", The
US-China Military and Defense Relationship during the Obama Presidency,
4/29/2018,
<https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-75838-1_2>)//RCU

A good case in point was **[the U.S. think-tank community's' analysis of
China's alleged 'militarization' of the South China
Sea]{.underline}**.54 Specifically, suppositions
**[inferred]{.underline}** from Chinese construction projects **[that
deployments of military assets]{.underline}** (e.g. combat aircraft and
mobile missile launchers) **[to the disputed islands]{.underline}**
(especially the Spratly Islands) could be expected in the near future,
which **[implied that Beijing intended to use these]{.underline}**
strategic **[outposts as a means to extend its]{.underline}**
anti-access/area denial **[(A2/AD) zone]{.underline}** (or exclusive
zone) **[to achieve aggressive and expansionist ends]{.underline}**. In
his congressional testimony, U.S. Pacific Command's Commander Admiral
Harry Harris asserted: 'China has fundamentally altered the physical and
political landscape in the South China Sea through large-scale land
reclamation and by militarizing these reclaimed features.'55 For
**[China did not consider deployments of 'defensive' military
installations as 'militarization', but rather a necessary response to
U.S. naval]{.underline}** Freedom of Navigation
(**[FONOPs]{.underline}**) **[exercises, and other provocative
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR)
activities]{.underline}** close to China's coastline. In short, the
**[amplification of United States--China divergences over what was meant
by 'militarization' caused both sides to perceive the other as engaging
in 'militarizing' activities, which]{.underline}** in turn **[increased
regional strategic instability]{.underline}** and intensified the United
States--China security dilemma.

### Perm: Don't Reject IR

#### Permutation do both -- mainstream IR shouldn't be rejected on-face if it's not perfect -- *[critically]{.underline}* working inside of them and recognizing it's not Truth generates reflexivity and solves its shortcomings

When Orientalist IR meets Occidental IR, hatred and conflict are
inevitable and will become perpetual practices in world politics. In
that context, the **[mainstream IR perspectives contribute to a culture
of insecurity between rising China and the West]{.underline}** while
they close down the creative space needed to imagine a different way of
engagement. In the dualistic circuit of mainstream IR perspectives, the
Self's epistemological violence toward the Other is often justified in
practice. This way of thinking conditions everyone to regard the
relationship between the Self and the Other as an inevitable clash and
obscures the process of learning that has led both the West and China to
transform themselves. **[There is no need to discard mainstream IR
perspectives altogether]{.underline}**, **[but neither is it useful to
remain boxed inside them when thinking about international
affairs]{.underline}**. Rather, **[we need to use mainstream IR
thought-patterns critically, rather than treating them as purely
objective standpoints that produce Truths]{.underline}**. **[IR
knowledge needs to be produced in a reflective spirit. Critical
knowledge consumption and reflective knowledge production create the
possibility of imagining different modes of the Self/Other nexus in IR
that are]{.underline}** less conflictual, **[more]{.underline}**
democratic, and truly **[global. Through such processes we can gain a
deeper understanding of IR scholarship, introduce greater reflexivity
into]{.underline}** its **[debates, and identify ways]{.underline}** in
which **[its neo-imperialist lacunas might be addressed.]{.underline}**

#### The permutation is best -- Chinese scholarship *[draws from]{.underline}* Western IR and seeks to *[supplement]{.underline}*, not supplant it

**Qin, 18** -- Professor of International Relations at China Foreign
Affairs University (Yaqing, "A Multiverse of Knowledge: Cultures and IR
Theories", The Chinese Journal of International Politics, 2018,
https://academic.oup.com/cjip/article-abstract/11/4/415/5162675)//RCU

In addition, these efforts purposefully aim to engage IR communities the
world over, especially mainstream Western IR theory, for dialog,
discussion, and debate. There is no intent to establish a small fiefdom.
**[Chinese theorists have learned from Western IR theories and been
inspired during this learning process. Although critical of Western IR
theories, they,]{.underline}** at the same time, **[integrate them into
their own discourses and narratives. They publish in
English]{.underline}** in order **[to communicate directly
with]{.underline}** their counterparts in other parts of the world,
especially in **[the West, and to enrich, rather than
replace]{.underline}** or displace, the **[existing IR
literature]{.underline}**. Some style themselves as non-Western and use
a national label. This stems largely from their perceived need to
articulate what is marginalized, represent what is neglected, and
emphatically accent multiplicity and plurality, so to make it more
conspicuously meaningful in the sociology of knowledge.

### China Reps Good

#### Chinese scholarship isn't mutually exclusive with realism -- *[moral realism]{.underline}* proves the same core assumptions are shared when describing China's intentions

**Qin, 18** -- Professor of International Relations at China Foreign
Affairs University; citing Yan Xuetong, distinguished professor and the
Dean of the Institute of International Relations at Tsinghua University
(Yaqing, "A Multiverse of Knowledge: Cultures and IR Theories", The
Chinese Journal of International Politics, 2018,
https://academic.oup.com/cjip/article-abstract/11/4/415/5162675)//RCU

**[Yan Xuetong has developed 'moral realism']{.underline}**. Like Carr,
Morgenthau, and Waltz, **[Yan places particular emphasis on
power]{.underline}**. His **[moral realism takes power as its central
concept and accepts]{.underline}** the **[basic assumptions of realism,
recognizing that anarchy is the nature of the international system, that
national interest is the prime mover of state action, and that struggle
for power]{.underline}** and world leadership **[is the inevitable
reality of world politics. At the same time]{.underline}**, however,
**[it argues that morality plays an important role in]{.underline}**
both constituting and **[exercising power]{.underline}**. 'Moral
realism' seems to be an oxymoron. Carr takes morality as something in an
entirely different category from power, 31 Morgenthau dismisses morality
as an insignificant factor in international politics and defines it
bluntly in terms of national interests,32 and Waltz leaves no room for
morality in his structural realism.33 **[By specifically
using]{.underline}** this key concept of **[morality and forcing it into
the realist narrative, Yan expands the horizon of both classical and
structural realism alike]{.underline}**.

It is obvious that **[Yan turns to traditional Chinese cultural
resources for information, especially]{.underline}** to China's
**[ancient thinkers of the pre-Qin period]{.underline}** (before 221
BCE) **[such as Guanzi, Confucius, Laozi, Mencius, Mozi, Xunzi, and
Hanfeizi, who wrote about power]{.underline}**, political authority,
**[and governance. Drawing on their works, Yan]{.underline}** develops a
realism that centers around world leadership. Inspired mainly by Xunzi,
Yan **[holds that]{.underline}** the international system is
hierarchical and that **[major powers]{.underline}** naturally
**[struggle for world leadership in such a hierarchical
order]{.underline}**. Leadership, however, is not composed of mere
material elements. **[Although economic and military capabilities are
important]{.underline}**, power of and for leadership should contain
strong nonmaterial or ideational elements. **[Morality
is]{.underline}**, thus, **[the key to the power of
leadership]{.underline}**. As Yan interprets Guanzi, '\... to maintain a
stable international order both material power and moral thought are
necessary'.34 In other words, **[material power is
important]{.underline}** but can be significant **[only when paired with
morality]{.underline}** if political leadership is involved and to be
sustained.

Yan tries to interpret the relationship between power and leadership to
answer a key question in politics---what power is most effective in the
successful competition for and sustainable maintenance of world
leadership. **[For him, ideal power is both material and
moral]{.underline}**, and the ideal leadership is Wangdao or humane
authority, which combines power and morality. **[Although these were the
thoughts of ancient Chinese philosophers, they are]{.underline}** highly
**[relevant in today's world wherein humane authority is more
effective]{.underline}** in the competition **[for world leadership than
hegemony]{.underline}**, which can neither be sustained nor endure. Yan
Xuetong published his book entitled Ancient Chinese Thought, Modern
Chinese Power, in which he discusses in detail his moral realism, in
2011.35

#### Our *[defensive]{.underline}* reading of China is in line with the Tianxia system -- they prioritize coexistence instead of self-interest

**Qin, 18** -- Professor of International Relations at China Foreign
Affairs University; citing Zhao Tingyang, professor and member of the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and a senior fellow of Peking
University Berggruen Research Institute. His theory of the Tianxia
System (All-Under-Heaven), a theory of world order, tries to transcend
Huntington's "clashes of civilizations," and advances an alternative to
the Kantian conception of perpetual peace. He has published many books
including The Tianxia System: Reimaging Visions of Global Order from the
Past and for the Future, and The Whirlpool that Produced China: Stag
Hunting on the Central Plains of China. (Yaqing, "A Multiverse of
Knowledge: Cultures and IR Theories", The Chinese Journal of
International Politics, 2018,
https://academic.oup.com/cjip/article-abstract/11/4/415/5162675)//RCU

**[Zhao Tingyang's theory of the 'all-under-heaven
system']{.underline}**, or a genuine worldism, **[is]{.underline}**
mainly **[unfolded in two of his books]{.underline}**, Tianxia System in
2005 and A Possible World of All-under-heaven System in 2016.36
**[Zhao's main concern is]{.underline}** order or **[an order of
perpetual peace throughout the world. Zhao models his Tianxia system on
that of the Western Zhou Dynasty]{.underline}** (1046--771 BCE),
**[which Confucius himself highly commended. Under the supreme rule of
the Zhou Court]{.underline}** and a few **[semi-sovereign
city-states]{.underline}** which, although ostensibly independent,
**[acknowledged and accepted Zhou governance]{.underline}**, the Zhou
thus governed what was known as Tianxia, meaning 'all-under-heaven',
meaning, at least theoretically and conceptually, the world as a whole.
**[As Zhou institutions governed all the states, the
people]{.underline}**, as subjects of the Zhou Court,
**[were]{.underline}**, therefore, **[at liberty to travel to all other
states]{.underline}**.

Zhao argues that the Zhou system is truly a world system because it had
no concept of aliens and its institutions served the system in its
entirety. **[The world today is governed by]{.underline}** the state
system established by the **[Westphalian peace treaties]{.underline}**,
**[wherein all states regard one another as alien. Since today's world
has no monolithic institution governing all]{.underline}**, or that has
political aspirations to cover the whole world, **[it is]{.underline}**
a world **[without a 'worldview']{.underline}** and without institutions
that are of and for all nations and peoples. **[Simply put, it is a
'non-world']{.underline}**. Conflict is then difficult to resolve and
transnational issues are hard to deal with through joint efforts.
Furthermore, the Westphalian international system is based on individual
states that are independent of one another and on interstate
institutions which, by nature and by design, cannot solve transnational
problems and global issues. **[The Confucian 'all-under-heaven system'
is inclusive and eliminates the self-other boundary. It
is,]{.underline}** therefore, all-inclusive or nonexclusive; **[a
constitution in the genuinely global sense, rather than one
that]{.underline}** only **[regulates individual
nation-states.]{.underline}**

**[Zhao's key concept]{.underline}** in his ideal narration of the Zhou
Dynasty and the Tianxia system **[is nonexclusivity]{.underline}**
which, according to Zhao, is far preferable to Kant's path to genuine
perpetual peace, successful governance, and a stable order the world
over. Related to nonexclusivity, **[Zhao's Tianxia system theory rests
on the ontology of coexistence rather than self-existence and on
family-ship rather than on individuality]{.underline}**. **[He
criticizes]{.underline}** the **[existing Western international theories
for their overemphasis on the exclusive existence of the
self]{.underline}** and holds that Western social theory is mistaken in
taking that ontological position, explicitly or implicitly, to interpret
the world, because this renders it a fragmented non-world.

**[The ontology of coexistence]{.underline}** differs. It **[gives
priority to coexistence]{.underline}**, arguing that coexistence comes
before self-existence, to the extent of constituting the prerequisite of
self-existence. Coexistence requires inclusiveness of Ego and Alter as
reflected in a family. Institutions designed and established for such a
nonexclusive system of coexistence are global in the real sense. They,
hence, constitute the prerequisite ontological position for establishing
a truly global system and solving global problems. **[The world
order]{.underline}**, therefore, **[must be based upon genuine world
institutions as embodied in the Confucian worldview]{.underline}** and
practiced by the ancient Chinese Western Zhou Dynasty in its Tianxia
system.

### Coop Solves 

#### A *[relational]{.underline}* view of Chinese behavior is best -- replace Western dualisms with mutual cooperation 

**Qin, 18** -- Professor of International Relations at China Foreign
Affairs University (Yaqing, "A Multiverse of Knowledge: Cultures and IR
Theories", The Chinese Journal of International Politics, 2018,
https://academic.oup.com/cjip/article-abstract/11/4/415/5162675)//RCU

**[Qin Yaqing has developed a relational theory of world politics around
the central concept of 'relationality'. On the basis of the Confucian
cultural community]{.underline}** over millennia, **[it provides a
different approach to understanding relationships]{.underline}** in an
increasingly complex world. **[It conceives the world of IR
as]{.underline}** one **[composed of ongoing relations rather than
discrete individual entities, assumes international actors as
actors-in-relations, and takes processes defined in]{.underline}** terms
of relations in **[motion as ontologically significant]{.underline}**. A
world of relations works in a considerably different way from a world of
atoms. It is one where dynamic relations define the identities and
activities of actors and where actors relate and are related as they
practice. **[It is also a world where politics is more about relations
than power and]{.underline}** wherein **[governance of relations is its
most skilful art]{.underline}**. Furthermore, the relational ontology
requires that relations among actors, rather than individual actors per
se, should be the pivot unit of analysis for social studies.

**[Qin's relational theory uses]{.underline}** as its epistemological
schema the **[Chinese zhongyong dialectics and believes that the
yin-yang relationship is the]{.underline}** meta **[relationship that
represents all relationships in the universe. It assumes]{.underline}**
that **[harmony is the state of nature and]{.underline}** that
**[polarities are]{.underline}** immanently **[inclusive
and]{.underline}** mutually **[complementary; they]{.underline}**,
hence, **[rely on each other for life and work together to generate a
new life. It denies]{.underline}** thus **[any dualistic structure and
dichotomous binary]{.underline}**, using the 'both-and' logic to negate
the 'either-or' way of thinking.37 Although it does place emphasis on
coexistence, it, at the same time, fully recognizes the existence of the
self, denying any pretext through which to subjugate the self in the
name of the collective. Thus, **[it argues for the simultaneity of
self-existence and other-existence]{.underline}**, and of self-existence
and coexistence, **[as with a drop of water and the sea. Neither one
comes before the other]{.underline}**. Ego and Alter are always found in
a relational entanglement and simultaneous mutuality. **[Such
entanglement and]{.underline}** simultaneity of the self and the other,
of self-existence and coexistence, and of self-interest and
**[cointerest represent our global life. We]{.underline}** accordingly
**[need to reconceptualize]{.underline}** certain key concepts of world
politics, for example, **[the ability to coempower rather than to impose
coercively as the optimal expression of power, and amity rather than
enmity as the most meaningful]{.underline}**, but often neglected,
practice and **[relationship in world politics]{.underline}**.

On the basis of relational ontology, it puts forward the logic of
relationality, arguing that social actors base their actions on
relations in the first place. **[The U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates' **[adoption of different policies toward
Britain and North Korea's nuclear weapons is]{.underline}** entirely
**[attributable to]{.underline}** the nature of **[its relationships
with the two]{.underline}** countries. It is only to be expected that a
state treats an ally, a neutral state, and an enemy quite differently
over the same issue.38 Actors are rational to do so owing to the
different nature of relationships. **[Qin's relational
theory]{.underline}** does not deny rationality but **[argues that
rationality is defined in terms of relationality, for without
considering the]{.underline}** nature of a **[relationship, it would be
impossible to define a rational action]{.underline}**. A social actor
needs first to define the relationship between her and the related other
and is then able to decide what action toward the latter is rational. As
Pouliot argues, while it makes sense for a Westerner to be rational when
planning investment in the economic field, 'it is quite nonsensical (and
socially reprehensible) to constantly calculate means and ends with
family and friends'.39 People are rational but relationally rational.
Human rationality in a social setting is always socially defined and
relationally expressed. It is what we may call relational rationality.

On December 2, 2016, US president-elect Donald **[Trump]{.underline}**
tweeted that he **[received a call of congratulations from the president
of Taiwan]{.underline}**, Tsai Ing-wen, and when questioned, defended
himself with these wry complaints: "**[Interesting how the U.S. sells
Taiwan]{.underline}** billions of dollars of **[military
equipment]{.underline}** **[but I should not accept a congratulatory
call"]{.underline}** and "Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their
currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our
projects going into ..."1 **[Whether the call was a calculated stunt or
a diplomatic gaffe]{.underline}**, **[Trump's tweets]{.underline}**
unwittingly **[reveal Taiwan to be "an American
frontier]{.underline}**," to borrow the words of the long-forgotten
**[George Kerr]{.underline}**, US diplomat and military adviser posted
there in the 1940s, who **[proposed to restructure Taiwan under US
guidance]{.underline}**, in effect **[creating an "accidental state" on
the island.]{.underline}**2 Wedged between the United States and China,
since the Cold War days **[this Pacific island-nation has been
positioned as a bargaining chip in the great power
politics]{.underline}**: released from Japanese colonial rule in 1945,
**[it has since been un/willingly framed as a keystone in the western
Pacific anticommunist front, acting as the opposite of the "subhuman,
inhuman, and humanly unthinkable China]{.underline}**"
**[that]{.underline}** allegedly **[threatens American]{.underline}**
happiness and **[greatness]{.underline}**.3 As a US--China frontier and
a military borderland emerging out of Han-Chinese settler colonialism,
Japan's colonial scheme for advancing to Southeast Asia, and US Pacific
imperial cartography,4 **[Taiwan's modern formations are deeply embedded
in these transpacific entanglements]{.underline}**, yet **[its
significance has been disavowed and absented]{.underline}**---indeed,
**[it serves a space of exception]{.underline}** that, **[as US media
are quick to acknowledge]{.underline}**, **[is]{.underline}** "perhaps
**[the most militarily vulnerable US partner anywhere in the world"
despite being a top market for US arms sales in Asia.5]{.underline}**
Our reason for invoking Taiwan here is manifold. As a central "problem"
in US--China relations, **[Taiwan represents]{.underline}** not just a
political concern but, more important for American studies scholars,
**[a]{.underline}** methodological and **[conceptual inspiration for
grappling with the complexities of "China" in the US global
imagination]{.underline}**.6 On the one hand, **[the reign
of]{.underline}** **[Trumpolitics]{.underline}** has **[rendered
Taiwan]{.underline}** \[End Page 443\] more **[visible]{.underline}**,
both **[domestically and internationally]{.underline}**, **[as a space
of exception structurally linked to Guantánamo]{.underline}**, **[Abu
Ghraib]{.underline}**, and **[Okinawa]{.underline}** **[that are
subjected to the regime of extraterritoriality]{.underline}**, **[which
is the]{.underline}** **[norm]{.underline}**---not exception---to
postwar American empire.7 While **[Taiwan]{.underline}** is neither an
incarceral space nor a host of a US military base now, its **[reliance
on US protection]{.underline}** and increasing economic integration with
China **[has locked itself in a state of "in/dependence]{.underline}**,"
**[a conundrum]{.underline}** that **[pessimists]{.underline}** have
**[predicted would be resolved only by war]{.underline}**.8 On the other
hand, **[the way Taiwan has been fronted]{.underline}** by Trump **[as a
bargaining chip reveals how large]{.underline}** **[China looms in the
US global imaginary]{.underline}** now **[and how]{.underline}** central
maintaining and **[managing the Pacific]{.underline}** and other
frontiers still **[is to the project of US imperialism]{.underline}**.
On a more personal level, as two Americanists with roots in Taiwan, we
hope to better comprehend these entangled, conflicting spaces and
politics, with Japan, Korea, the Pacific islands, and Southeast Asia
deeply implicated in complex transpacific dynamism. **[Against the tired
tropes of orientalism]{.underline}** and Cold War divisions, **[we hope
to initiate dialogue between]{.underline}** the rich field of
**[transpacific studies and inter-Asia critique as we strive to imagine
more capacious]{.underline}** and self-critical **[approaches to the
"global" in American studies]{.underline}**. Today, **[US--China
relations are]{.underline}** increasingly **[characterized by
competition, collusion, complicity, and even collaboration on the global
scale rather than]{.underline}** simply **[domination and]{.underline}**
**[resistance]{.underline}** on the Pacific front. **[Through
rearticulating frontier spaces as critical borderlands in their
disparate forms and modalities in this new context, we seek to highlight
critical visions and practices that reorient America's global imaginary
about China as a relational comparativist project toward decolonization
and de-imperialization.]{.underline}** Reconsidering Frontier Today In
his statements about Taiwan, **[Kerr characterizes Taiwan as "a trouble
spot" where]{.underline}** the **["two frontiers]{.underline}**
\[American and Chinese\] **[meet and overlap]{.underline}**," and
considered its national formation similar to the American experience, as
**[a frontier nation settled by "hardy pioneers]{.underline}**, bold and
adventurous."9 **[Kerr's allusion]{.underline}** to Frederick Jackson
Turner's frontier thesis, especially the analogous relation that he
**[draws between Taiwan and the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates**[, urges us to consider state
formations]{.underline}**, including **[postcolonial ones in
Taiwan]{.underline}** and elsewhere**[, as inherently settler colonial

**[The Trump administration's plan to sell more than 60 new F-16 fighter

after Washington and Beijing agreed to restart trade talks. **[Taiwan
formally submitted a request for 66]{.underline}** "Block 70" **[F-16

this year, but the deal took longer than expected to hammer out due to

is to move the sale to the next step by the August congressional recess,
according to one administration official. However, it is not yet a done
deal. The request must be converted into a formal
proposal]{.underline}** by the Defense and State Departments, **[and
then formally notified to Congress. Lawmakers would then have 30 days to
block the sale.]{.underline}** Taiwan already has roughly 140 older

"China's position to firmly oppose arms sales to Taiwan is consistent
and clear," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in
March, after reports emerged that U.S. President Donald Trump's
administration had given tacit approval for the sale. "We have made
stern representations to the U.S. We have urged the U.S. to fully
recognize the sensitivity of this issue and the harm it will cause."

China, reportedly [removing eight

about China's subversive economic practices, stealing of U.S.
technology, ongoing military buildup, and island-building campaign in
the South China Sea. **[Taiwan has]{.underline}** long **[been a flash

declare independence since 1949, when the two split after Mao Zedong's
Communists won China's civil war. The United States does not recognize
Taiwan, but the Taiwan Relations Act obligates the U.S. government to
help the island nation maintain self-defense capabilities. The United
States has long sold weapons to Taiwan. The **[Trump administration

equipment]{.underline}**. If approved, the sale would mark **[one of the
largest]{.underline}** to Taiwan **[in recent years]{.underline}** by
the United States. **[But the new F-16 sale, which would be valued at a
much higher price point, would be significantly more provocative.
Previous administrations, including]{.underline}** former Presidents
George W. **[Bush and]{.underline}** Barack **[Obama, rejected Taiwan's
request to buy new F-16s]{.underline}**, likely so as not to provoke

that an attack by China on Taiwan might come sooner rather than later.
In January, Chinese President Xi Jinping warned that any independence
efforts by Taiwan could be met by armed force, implicitly threatening
the United States if it tried to intervene. "There is a consensus that's
almost bipartisan in Washington that it's time to be a bit more
assertive against China,"]{.underline}** Richard Aboulafia, an analyst
with the Teal Group,

#### The jets jeapordize Xi's political legitimacy - he has no choice but to respond in kind

**Lee 19** - senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, (John, "Why a US
Sale of Fighter Jets to Taiwan Matters,"
<https://thediplomat.com/2019/04/why-a-us-sale-of-fighter-jets-to-taiwan-matters/>,
EM)

In the lead-up to the 1996 Taiwanese presidential elections, mainland
China conducted a series of missile tests to express its displeasure
against the pro-independence leanings of then-leader Lee Teng-hui and
impress on the Taiwanese electorate that returning Lee to office might
lead to war. The United States' response to the so-called [Third Taiwan
Strait
Crisis](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-third-taiwan-strait-crisis-the-forgotten-showdown-19742),
which was to order two aircraft carrier groups to the area, did the
trick. The largest display of American military might since the Vietnam
War forced a humiliating Chinese backdown and persuaded Beijing it
needed to modernize its military to counter the U.S. Navy. The Chinese
move also backfired as Lee's popularity in Taiwan gained a shot in the
arm for standing up to the mainland. Back in 1996, China's [military
budget](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/SIPRI-Milex-data-1949-2017.xlsx)
was only about twice that of Taiwan's and approximately 16 times smaller
than that of the United States. Today, the People's Liberation Army's
(PLA) budget is almost 22 times larger than Taiwan's and over one-third
that of the United States. China's advanced short-range ballistic
missile could destroy every runway attached to Taiwan's six air force
bases and destroy almost all Taiwanese fighter planes in the early
moments of a war. The PLA has established superiority over Taiwan in the
air, and on and under the water. The only thing the PLA cannot achieve
is landing troops on Taiwan without suffering unacceptable losses. In
late March, [Bloomberg
reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-21/trump-aides-said-to-back-selling-f-16-fighter-planes-to-taiwan)
that U.S. President Donald **[Trump's advisers]{.underline}** had
**[encouraged Taiwan to submit a formal request to buy up]{.underline}**
to **[60 advanced F-16V]{.underline}** fighter **[planes.]{.underline}**
Any sale must still be approved by Congress and **[would be the first
major aircraft purchase]{.underline}** from the United States by Taiwan
**[since 1992. During her visit to Hawaii last week, Taiwanese President
Tsai Ing-wen confirmed that Taiwan had requested a purchase of new
fighter jets from the United States. Days later, two Chinese fighter
planes crossed the median line in the Taiwan Strait that divides China
and Taiwan -- the first time this has occurred for 20
years.]{.underline}** Even if the F-16V sale goes ahead, **[Taiwan's new
planes will not alter the military balance between China and Taiwan, nor
dissuade the mainland from further provocations]{.underline}** such as
the median line flyover. **[That is not Beijing's primary concern,
however. The most important calculation]{.underline}** China must make
**[is not the relative capabilities]{.underline}** of the Taiwanese
armed forces **[but how the United States will respond in the event of a
crisis]{.underline}** or conflict **[in the Taiwan Strait. Every
clue]{.underline}** with respect to uncovering U.S. intention **[is
vital because U.S. intervention could tip the military balance against
China]{.underline}** in any such conflict. In any event, it guarantees
the end of any "acceptable cost" outcome in the event of conflict for
China. Under the United States' 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, any attempt
to forcibly determine Taiwan's future is considered "a threat to peace
and security of the Western Pacific and of grave concern to the United
States." To prevent that, **[Washington is obligated to sell "arms of a
defensive character" to]{.underline}** Taipei to allow the latter to
defend itself and **[dissuade China from launching any military action.
Since the Bill Clinton era, administrations have denied Taiwan's request
to purchase new fighter planes on the basis that the grey line from
"defense" to "offense" might be crossed.]{.underline}** Speaking from
Hawaii, **[Tsai let the cat out of the bag [when she
said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/taiwans-tsai-confirms-request-to-buy-new-us-fighters-tanks/2019/03/28/f0af9308-510f-11e9-bdb7-44f948cc0605_story.html?utm_term=.d18767084612)
the purchase of advanced fourth generation fighters would "greatly
enhance our land and air capabilities, strengthen military moral and
show to the world the U.S. commitment to Taiwan's defense." It is the
last line which sends shivers down the spine of mainland
leaders.]{.underline}** Since the Taiwan Relations Act came into force,
**[the United States has deliberately embarked on a policy of "strategic
ambiguity"]{.underline}** with respect to its military commitments to
Taiwan in the event the latter is attacked. **[Whether the United States
intervenes is a matter of political judgment and strategic assessment.
Under the Barack Obama administration, the decision to only offer Taipei
upgrades to its aging F-16 A/B planes suggested to Beijing that
de-escalating tensions arising from differences over Taiwan was the
predominant mindset. In contrast, the Trump administration has shown
unprecedented willingness to escalate tensions with China over
political, strategic, and economic differences.]{.underline}** The
speech by Vice President Mike Pence last October at the Hudson Institute
and the 2017 National Security Strategy pulled no punches in identifying
China as a comprehensive rival to the United States. **[If the sale of
F-16V planes goes through, then, it is evidence that the mindset in
Washington with respect to Taiwan has also changed and is less accepting
of mainland sensibilities and demands. Such a sale would be an
indication that preserving de facto Taiwanese independence is once more
considered critical to U.S. and allied strategy when it comes to keeping
the PLA confined to inside the so-called First Island Chain. That would
be a significant blow to Chinese President Xi Jinping's plans. In a
wide-ranging speech]{.underline}** on Taiwan in January to mark the 40th
anniversary of the "Message to Compatriots in Taiwan" **[delivered to
the 1978 National People's Congress, Xi implied that "reunification"
with Taiwan was a "historic task" he wanted to achieve during his
tenure. A U.S. sale of F-16Vs to Taiwan --- and all it implies --- makes
fulfillment of that task less likely.]{.underline}** Finally, the
strength of American support for Taiwan will influence how other nations
respond to persistent Chinese attempts to reduce international space
within which Taiwan can act as a de facto sovereign entity. The most
important regional relationship for Taiwan is with Japan, which has
emerged under Shinzo Abe as the political, strategic, and economic
leader among democratic Asian nations. On issues such as the
Trans-Pacific Partnership, Tokyo has shown initiative when Washington
has been found wanting. The Japanese leader has emerged as one of the
few regional countries to have established a strong personal
relationship with Taiwan's Tsai and is widely seen as the most
pro-Taiwan leaders amongst U.S. allies in the region. Even then, Abe's
room to move is dependent on the extent to which the United States is
willing to defend Taipei's desire to behave as a de facto sovereign
entity. If it is confirmed that Washington is moving to a more robust
approach with respect to cross-strait relations, Japan, Australia and
others will follow. Xi is already under internal pressure from the
global pushback against his flagship policies such as the Belt and Road
Initiative and "Made in China 2025." China has lost goodwill with
neighboring states over its actions in the East and South China Seas and
along the disputed border with India. It is in the middle of an economic
war with the United States while the European Union and Japan are openly
criticizing China for violations of economic rules and norms, including
the systematic theft of intellectual property by Chinese state-owned
firms and "national champions." Xi took a great risk in abandoning the
rhetoric and diplomacy of China's "peaceful rise," which was promulgated
by his predecessor Hu Jintao. Previously admired for his iron
determination to achieve China's great "rejuvenation," **[Xi is now
being criticized domestically]{.underline}** for overreach and
miscalculation. **[It is speculated that the legitimacy of the Communist
Party would not survive the "loss" of Taiwan. If the United States goes
ahead with the sale of F-16Vs to Taiwan, then the pressure on a
president who has embarked on an unprecedented "anti-corruption
campaign" to silence political enemies and doubters will be
immense.]{.underline}**

#### Escalation is likely - Chinese leaders wont back down or negotiate

**Lopez 6/11** (Linette, senior finance correspondent at Business
Insider, "**[Forget the trade war --- a bigger conflict between the US
and China is playing out right under our noses]{.underline}**,"
https://www.businessinsider.com/us-arms-sales-to-taiwan-bigger-threat-to-us-china-relations?module=topTout&area=links)

**[The world has its eye on the trade war between the US and China, but
a more dangerous confrontation]{.underline}** between the two nations
**[is playing out]{.underline}** in the background: **[the worsening
disagreement over the \"One China\" policy.]{.underline}** Last week,
Reuters reported that Washington was on its way to approving \$2 billion
worth of arms **[sales to Taiwan]{.underline}**. **[The move
indicates]{.underline}** the **[Trump]{.underline}** administration
**[isn\'t trying to create an atmosphere conducive to trade negotiations
and suggests]{.underline}** that **[disputes between the US and China
are more likely headed toward escalation than resolution.]{.underline}**
\"**[Taiwan is the thing the Chinese care most about hands
down]{.underline}**,\" **[said]{.underline}** Susan **[Thornton, a
former assistant US secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific
affairs. \"Anything where the US is interfering with Taiwan hits a
national third rail.\"]{.underline}** The One China policy --- under
which the US acknowledges China\'s claim that Taiwan is not an
independent nation but rather a part of China, without taking a side ---
was developed during the Nixon administration to improve US-China
relations. The idea is central to China\'s identity as a modern world
power, and since President Donald Trump took office the US has
challenged that notion repeatedly. Despite protests from Beijing, Trump
signed the Taiwan Travel Act, legislation permitting high-level talks
between US and Taiwanese officials, last year. In May, the US national
security adviser, John Bolton, met with David Lee, one of Taiwan\'s top
security officials. This meeting came just after Taiwan renamed its
unofficial embassy in Washington the Taiwan Council for US Affairs. The
old name, the Coordination Council for North American Affairs, neglected
to mention Taiwan or the US. The **[Trump]{.underline}** administration
**[has also sold arms to Taiwan before]{.underline}**, as have previous
administrations, **[but this]{.underline}** \$2 billion arms **[sale
digs at a delicate wound during a delicate time]{.underline}**. **[It\'s
a big sale, even in a world where weapons are becoming more and more
expensive]{.underline}**. And though it does not include the US\'s top
fighter jets, **[it is sure to antagonize Beijing before the G20 meeting
at the end of the month]{.underline}** in Osaka, Japan, where US and
Chinese heads of state are expected to meet. On Thursday, **[a Chinese
Foreign Ministry representative,]{.underline}** Geng **[Shuang,
responded to the news of the arms sale with a warning,]{.underline}**
according to the Chinese state media outlet Xinhua. **[\"We urge the US
side to stop arms sales to Taiwan]{.underline}** and sever their
military ties, prudently and properly handle Taiwan-related issues,
**[to avoid serious damage to China-US relations]{.underline}** as well
as to the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait,\" Geng said. It\'s
just imagination In January **[2017, China]{.underline}** --- most
likely aware that the incoming US president was unfamiliar with the
complexities of US-China relations --- **[clarified its position on
Taiwan in a]{.underline}** rare US media **[interview by the Chinese
Foreign Ministry official]{.underline}** Lu **[Kang]{.underline}**.
\"**[Because this issue touches upon China\'s core
interest,]{.underline}** **[by no means is this something that could be
negotiated or used as a bargaining chip,\"]{.underline}** he told NBC.
\" One China policy, 100%.\" **[The fight over Taiwan\'s status started
in 1949 after the Nationalist leader]{.underline}** Chiang **[Kai-shek
left the mainland for the island when he was defeated by Mao Zedong\'s
Communist forces. To the Chinese, the island\'s independence is both a
product and a reminder of China\'s century of
humiliation,]{.underline}** when China was carved up by foreign powers
and then thrown into decades of chaos and civil war after the end of the
Qing dynasty. \"It\'s the mythology they\'ve told themselves for
years,\" Thornton said. In that way **[the One China policy and China\'s
economic nationalism are tied together in the Chinese political
imagination]{.underline}**. That may seem foreign to the US, where one
set of technocrats handles economics and another handles national
security, but the merging of the two interests are a response to the
China\'s lost century. And both are being tested by the Trump
administration. This despite the fact that **[the conflict has all the
trappings of the Cold War era]{.underline}**. **[China sees US
interference in Taiwan as an encroachment on its sphere of
influence]{.underline}**. And the US sees Chinese involvement in the
Caribbean similarly.

#### Nationalism subsumes any other consideration 

**Mearsheimer 14** (John J, R. Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service
Professor of Political Science at the University of Chicago, "Say
Goodbye to Taiwan," 2-25,
<https://nationalinterest.org/article/say-goodbye-taiwan-9931?page=0%2C3>)

There is a second reason the United States might eventually forsake
**[Taiwan]{.underline}**: it **[is an especially dangerous
flashpoint]{.underline}**, **[which could easily precipitate a
Sino-American war]{.underline}** that is not in America's interest. U.S.
policy makers understand that **[the fate of Taiwan is a matter of great
concern to Chinese of all persuasions and]{.underline}** that **[they
will be extremely angry if it looks like the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[is preventing unification]{.underline}**.
But that is exactly what Washington will be doing if it forms a close
military alliance with Taiwan, and that point will not be lost on the
Chinese people. It is important to note in this regard that **[Chinese
nationalism]{.underline}**, which is **[a potent force]{.underline}**,
**[emphasizes how great powers like the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[humiliated China in the past]{.underline}**
when it was weak and appropriated Chinese territory like Hong Kong and
Taiwan. Thus, **[it is not difficult to imagine crises breaking out over
Taiwan or scenarios in which a crisis escalates into a shooting
war]{.underline}**. After all, **[Chinese nationalism will surely be a
force for trouble in those crises, and China will]{.underline}** at some
point [**have the military wherewithal to conquer Taiwan, which will
make war even more likely.** **There was no flashpoint between the
superpowers during the Cold War that was as dangerous as Taiwan will be
in a Sino-American security competition**]{.underline}. Some
commentators liken Berlin in the Cold War to Taiwan, but Berlin was not
sacred territory for the Soviet Union and it was actually of little
strategic importance for either side. Taiwan is different. **[Given how
dangerous it is for precipitating a war and given the fact that the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates will eventually reach the
point where it cannot defend Taiwan, there is a reasonable chance that
American policy makers will eventually conclude that **[it makes good
strategic sense to abandon Taiwan and allow China to coerce it into
accepting unification]{.underline}**.

#### Interdependence doesn't check 

**White 13** --- Hugh White, Professor of Strategic Studies at the
Australian National University, former Intelligence Analyst with
Australia's Office of National Assessments and Senior Official with
Australia's Department of Defence, 2013 ("Power and Ambition," *The
China Choice: Why We Should Share Power*, Published by Oxford University
Press, ISBN 9780199684717, p. 50-53)

Interdependence **[The view that China's economic interests will
preclude it challenging America in Asia is often buttressed by a broader
argument about the consequences of economic
interdependence]{.underline}**. Kant predicted over 200 years ago that
as trade among countries increased, the costs of conflict would grow
too, while the motives for conflict would dwindle. Eventually trade
would make rivalry and war disappear. Some people think he has been
proved right since the end of the Cold War. For twenty years, relations
between the world's major powers have been notably stable and peaceful,
coinciding with unprecedented globalisation and economic growth. It has
been tempting to see this as the sign of a new international reality:
globalisation causes the peace, and globalisation is irreversible, so
peace in future is assured, at least between major powers. Certainly,
the more countries trade and invest with one another, the greater the
economic cost of conflict and the stronger the incentive to keep the
peace. America and China today are more interdependent economically than
any two comparably powerful states have ever been before, and this will
certainly restrain ambition and rivalry on both sides. The question is
whether the restraints will prove stronger than the pressures going the
other way. **[If interdependence does trump strategic and political
ambition, we should be seeing it happening between the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and China now -- but
we have not seen much evidence of that yet. So far the two countries
seem to be acting very much as strong states in the past have acted as
relative power shifts from one to the other. Pessimists]{.underline}**
like John Mearsheimer and Niall Ferguson **[remind us that before war
broke out in 1914, the great powers of Europe had grown more
economically interdependent than they had ever been before, and than
they would be again for almost a century]{.underline}**. 12 The lesson
to draw is that **[interdependence increases the incentive for leaders
to subordinate political ambitions and ignore nationalist sentiments,
but it does not remove the need for them to take these bold and
politically risky steps. The hard choices still have to be made. It is
easy for leaders to see that economic interests require them to
compromise their countries' aspirations for international status and
power, but it is harder for them to acknowledge that to their people,
and harder still to put their economic interests ahead of strategic and
political ones when a choice has to be made]{.underline}**. In fact,
**[most often people see it as shameful to put economic concerns first
when issues of power and status are engaged. What president would tell
the American people that their country will compromise its position
on]{.underline}** an issue like **[Taiwan in order to protect America's
economic interests? What Chinese leader could make the same argument to
the Chinese people? When a choice has to be made, especially when it has
to be made in the glare of an international crisis, it is very hard to
put economics first]{.underline}**. In some ways **[the obvious
importance of economic interdependence increases rather than limits the
risk that rivalry will escalate]{.underline}**, **[because of the way it
can affect one country's view of the other's priorities]{.underline}**.
There seems to be a pattern here: **[each side believes that the
imperatives of interdependence will press more heavily on the other.
That inclines both governments to assume that the other will compromise
to protect the economic relationship, so they do not have to do so. In
Washington they expect China to back down from its challenge to America
once Beijing understands the economic risks of rivalry. In Beijing they
think America will blink. That makes both of them less inclined to
compromise their own position -- which makes escalation more
likely]{.underline}**. Ultimately, **[faith in the power of
interdependence boils down to faith in the power of money to trump other
emotions and motivations. That is a risky proposition. We cannot assume
that Chinese leaders will always choose rationally to maximise China's
objective benefits. They are no less liable than the leaders of any
other country to allow what may be, or may seem to us to be, irrational
desires for status and influence to trump the rational calculations of
national interest]{.underline}**.

#### Conflict goes nuclear

THE PROSPECTS for avoiding intense military competition and war may be
good, but **[growth in China\'s power may]{.underline}** **[nevertheless
require some changes in U.S. foreign policy]{.underline}** that
Washington will find disagreeable\--particularly **[regarding
Taiwan]{.underline}**. Although it lost control of Taiwan during the
Chinese Civil War more than six decades ago, **[China still considers
Taiwan to be part of its homeland, and unification remains a key
political goal for Beijing]{.underline}**. **[China has made clear that
it will use force if Taiwan declares independence]{.underline}**, and
much of China\'s conventional military buildup has been dedicated to
increasing its ability to coerce Taiwan and reducing the United States\'
ability to intervene. **[Because China places such high value on Taiwan
and because the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and
China\--whatever they might formally agree to\--have such different
attitudes regarding the legitimacy of the status quo, the issue poses
special dangers and challenges for the U.S.-Chinese relationship,
placing it in a different category than Japan or South Korea. A crisis
over Taiwan could]{.underline}** fairly **[easily escalate to nuclear
war, because each step]{.underline}** along the way
**[might]{.underline}** well **[seem rational to the actors
involved.]{.underline}** Current U.S. policy is designed to reduce the
probability that Taiwan will declare independence and to make clear that
the United States will not come to Taiwan\'s aid if it does.
Nevertheless, **[the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[would find itself under pressure to protect Taiwan against any sort
of attack, no matter how it originated]{.underline}**. **[Given the
different interests and perceptions of the various parties and the
limited control Washington has over Taipei\'s behavior, a crisis could
unfold in which the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[found itself following events rather than leading
them]{.underline}**. Such dangers have been around for decades, but
**[ongoing improvements in China\'s military capabilities may make
Beijing more willing to escalate a Taiwan crisis]{.underline}**. **[In
addition to its improved conventional capabilities, China is modernizing
its nuclear forces to increase their ability to survive and retaliate
following a large-scale U.S. attack]{.underline}**. **[Standard
deterrence theory holds that Washington\'s current ability to destroy
most or all of China\'s nuclear force enhances its bargaining position.
China\'s nuclear modernization might remove that check on Chinese
action, leading Beijing to behave more boldly in future crises than it
has in past ones]{.underline}**. **[A U.S. attempt to preserve its
ability to defend Taiwan]{.underline}**, meanwhile, **[could fuel a
conventional and nuclear arms race]{.underline}**. Enhancements to U.S.
offensive targeting capabilities and strategic ballistic missile
defenses might be interpreted by China as a signal of malign U.S.
motives, leading to further Chinese military efforts and a general
poisoning of U.S.-Chinese relations.

#### The plan recalibrates Taiwan's defensive posture - an elastic denial-in-depth strategy is the best of both worlds

**Hunzeker and Lanoszka 18** (Michael and Alexander,
<http://csps.gmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/A-Question-of-Time.pdf>,
EM)

**[The cornerstone of any deterrence posture is its ability to impose
unacceptable costs on an adversary]{.underline}** if it attempts to
attack, either through denial or punishment. **[To date, Taiwan has
largely hedged in a manner that emphasizes high-end, highvisibility
platforms, largely on the assumption that]{.underline}** the
international community in general---and **[the United
States]{.underline}** in particular---**[will intervene in a worst-case
invasion scenario. We think this assumption is dangerous]{.underline}**
for reasons already discussed. **[Moreover, although China might appear
content with maintaining the status quo for now, its strategic calculus
is surely based, in part, on its beliefs about Taiwan's ability to
impose unacceptable costs on an invasion force.]{.underline}** **[To the
degree that Taiwan continues over-investing in a small number of
expensive and exquisite platforms, it will likely continue to find
itself at both a qualitative and quantitative disadvantage. The more the
gap widens, the more Chinese leaders may be tempted to resolve the
"Taiwan problem" by force of arms.]{.underline}** To develop a more
effective conventional deterrence posture, Taiwan must ruthlessly
question its assumptions about China. For example, three assumptions
frequently came up during our interviews. Each is problematic. The first
assumption is that China does not need to be deterred. According to this
line of reasoning, Chinese leaders are unwilling to use force against
Taiwan because they are more interested in economic advancement and
increasing their power ahead of any military confrontation. **[The
problem is that Chinese calculations can change over time, and Taiwan
cannot take it for granted that China will remain internally focused.
Taiwan must prepare now to sufficiently deter China. A second assumption
is two-fold: that the United States will intervene and that receipt of
the latest U.S. weaponry signals U.S. resolve to China. This assumption
is perhaps even more dangerous because determining exactly how the
United States might respond to an invasion scenario is difficult. The
United States has long maintained a policy of "strategic
ambiguity."]{.underline}** Although some scholars point to a
historically robust amount of weapons sales to Taiwan since 2008 as
evidence of deterrence, others suggest that the United States strives to
avoid direct military intervention.172 **[The fact of the matter is that
it is anyone's guess whether the United States would risk nuclear
conflict with China over Taiwan. At a minimum, enough uncertainty
surrounds how the United States might react that Taiwan's defense
planners should not build Taiwan's deterrence posture on the assumption
that the United States can--- or will---intervene]{.underline}**. The
third assumption is that the most advanced fighter jets patrolling the
skies will embolden the population to keep up the fight. Polling already
indicates more than 30% of those in Taiwan do not think military force
should even be used to stop China from reunifying. As discussed in the
last chapter, little evidence suggests Taiwan will be able to launch
their fighters in the midst of a conflict.173 Perhaps more accurately,
however, a number of officials pointed to China's fear as the primary
source of deterrence. During the interviews, a number of political,
military, and academic leaders suggested **[Chinese government
officials]{.underline}** were self deterred because they **[are afraid
of a long, drawn out conflict and the uncertainty it would
create.]{.underline}** After all, the longer a military conflict with
Taiwan drags on, the more likely it is that the United States will
intervene. Those interviewed also indicated Chinese leaders might also
be afraid of domestic unrest in response to high numbers of casualties,
potentially exacerbated by the one-child policy, which might make
Chinese families particularly casualty-averse. **[With this in mind, the
following discussion focuses on lengthening any potential conflict and
causing high rates of casualties on the invading force.]{.underline}**
Ideally, with effective signaling to China, these recommendations would
lower the probability of conflict. **[We]{.underline}** again
**[recommend that Taiwan rebalance its investments to emphasize its
war-fighting capabilities even if this shift constrains its ability to
counter]{.underline}** Chinese **[provocations in the grey
zone.]{.underline}** We think that it makes more sense for Taiwan to
accept risk in its peacetime presence, because such capabilities will
not deter China from invading. Of course, as argued in the preceding
chapter, Taiwan cannot and should not completely divest itself of all of
its high-end air and naval platforms, since these have an important role
to play in countering China's most likely threats.174 However, we
believe that **[Taiwan can "do more with less]{.underline}**" in this
area. **[Cutting investment]{.underline}** in the IDS program,
Aegis-like destroyers, and the amphibious shipping force **[will yield
more resources to invest in truly asymmetric capabilities. Ultimately,
Taiwan is better off deterring a worst-case invasion---even if it means
living with increased grey zone incursion---than the other way
around.]{.underline}** And a military optimized to counter grey zone
threats will be particularly vulnerable to an invasion scenario. Beyond
emphasizing its war-fighting capabilities over its grey zone
capabilities, **[we believe that Taiwan should focus on acquiring a
particular set of weapons and on developing a particular set of
strategies for using them. Specifically, we argue that Taiwan should
primarily invest in an unconventional force structure, which it should
plan to employ asymmetrically. We call this approach "elastic
denial-in-depth."]{.underline}** It is built around the use of an
unconventional layered force posture that **[emphasizes four denial
zones: in the air, at sea, on the ground, and within
society.]{.underline}** In the air and at sea, **[Taiwan should focus on
acquiring large numbers of relatively low-cost, dedicated
counterinvasion capabilities. On the ground, active duty army and
repurposed marine forces should prepare for long-range coastal defense,
counterattack, and fighting retrograde missions. Finally, we suggest
that Taiwan begin serious planning for social denial. In practical
terms, Taiwan should restructure its sizeable reserve force to prepare
it to conduct a prolonged insurgency campaign in urban, jungle, and
mountain settings.]{.underline}** While this strategy is primarily
concerned with deterring an invasion of Taiwan itself, the capabilities
recommended above will also be effective in preventing a smaller land
grab of Taiwan's outlying islands.  Although such an attempt would
constitute a substantial escalation, China could potentially seize the
outlying islands to improve invasion staging or to exert political
pressure on the Taiwanese government.  Ultimately, these outlying
islands will remain vulnerable and well inside China's A2/AD envelope,
so hardening the islands with dispersed, asymmetric defenses (the same
ones recommended for Taiwan itself ) to impose costs on any potential
invasion will maximize Taiwan's ability to deter such a land grab. It is
also important to remember that the loss of its outlying islands will
not represent an existential threat to Taiwan. **[Although Taiwan
already possesses many of the capabilities needed to execute this
layered, asymmetric, and unconventional approach, they are not currently
fielded as part of a holistic and integrated strategy. These
capabilities can include not only traditional forces such as mobile air
defense and antiaircraft missile launchers but also transformative
technologies such as 3D printing and drones]{.underline}** in addition
to a comprehensive restructuring of their Reserve Command.

#### Asymmetric capabilities are more effective yet less inflammatory

**[includes 108 M1A2T Abrams tanks, 250 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles

Monday's announcement comes amid ongoing discussions between Washington
and Beijing over the trade war the two are waging and just days before
Taiwan's president, Tsai Ing-wen, prepares for a trip to North America,
which has also angered the Chinese government. **[But a much bigger deal

it **[sent a letter of request]{.underline}** to Washington **[to buy 66
F-16V fighter jets]{.underline}** from Lockheed Martin, which would give
the small independent island a fleet of the most advanced 4th generation
fighters in the world. If the deal goes through, it would be **[the
first major aircraft sale]{.underline}** to Taiwan **[since
1992]{.underline}**, through [there are serious
doubts](https://time.com/5564773/taiwan-fighter-jet-sale-trump-china/)
the Trump administration would sign off on the deal while it is involved
in delicate trade negotiations with Beijing. **[There is]{.underline}**
also **[the question of what role the F-16s could play in any potential
conflict with China. Facing off against China's]{.underline}** J-20 and
J-31 **[5th generation fighters may be]{.underline}** a **[daunting
task, and the F-16s would]{.underline}** likely **[be]{.underline}**
useful "in less than all-out scenarios, but probably highly
**[vulnerable in an early, all-out missile strike and aerial
bombardment]{.underline}**," said Scott Harold, associate director of
the RAND Center for Asia Pacific Policy. "**[Beijing will kvetch about
anything]{.underline}**," Harold added, "**[but]{.underline}** would
probably complain **[more about F-16Vs primarily because these would
be]{.underline}** a **[politically embarrassing]{.underline}** sale
**[for Beijing.]{.underline}**" **[The Stinger sale, however, might be
an indication that Taiwan is truly adopting a more asymmetric
approach]{.underline}** to self-defense, as the shoulder-launched weapon
is easily moved and allows soldiers to fire and flee quickly. While the
\$2 billion spent on Abrams tanks has raised some eyebrows --- "you
would struggle to find anyone that can make an operational case for the
tank sale," said Eric Sayers, an Indo-Pacific export at the CNAS
thinktank here-- it's still "another positive sign of how arms sales are
moving away from the large package approach of Bush and Obama and
towards considering Taiwan's requests on a case by case basis." More
**[critical for]{.underline}** Taiwan's self-defense and **[deterrent
capability are ground-to-air weapons, submarines, and electronic warfare
systems.]{.underline}** "I could find a more effective way to spend a
billion dollars -- a huge portion of Taipei's \$11 billion defense
budget -- to enhance cross-strait deterrence," Sayers added. The
Stingers are more intriguing however, and "are a great weapon if they
can target the PLA's airframes," Harold said, "though I don't know how
effective they would be against stealthy platforms like the J-20 or
J-31." The sales, and the debate over shipping the F-16Vs to Taiwan,
comes amid a regular stream of US warships sailing in international
waters between Taiwan and mainland China, and just as US, Australian,
Japanese, and Canadian forces kick off the massive Talisman Sabre 2019
exercise.

#### Policymakers ought to tolerate grey zone intrusions - the alternative is an outright invasion 

**Hunzeker and Lanoszka 18** (Michael and Alexander,
<http://csps.gmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/A-Question-of-Time.pdf>,
EM)

**[China seems to prefer]{.underline}** challenging Taiwan in **[the
grey zone.]{.underline}** For the foreseeable future, provocations,
subversion, and disinformation will remain a more likely threat than
missile strikes, a naval blockade, or an invasion. To counter this grey
zone challenge, Taiwan needs conventional platforms that can operate in
a permissive, peacetime environment. Most U.S. analysts who propose that
Taiwan should focus on acquiring unconventional platforms tend to
overlook this need, forgetting that weapons systems and platforms are
often as useful for performing political and symbolic roles as they are
for war-fighting purposes. With respect to the grey zone threat, open
ocean-going ships, modern fighter jets, and other conventional weapons
signal resolve to domestic and international audiences. Moreover,
conventional weapons fill this important role in a way that
unconventional systems such as missiles, mines, and patrol boats cannot.
For these reasons, Taiwan's Navy and Air Force should not pursue a
purely unconventional/asymmetric naval and air posture. Taiwan must
maintain an inventory of conventional ships and fighter aircraft to
counter China in the grey zone. **[And yet Taiwan should not invest too
much in conventional air and naval force structure.]{.underline}**
First, **[Taiwan is already well within the range of China's longrange
strike systems. The characteristics that make conventional ships and
fighter jets valuable in grey zone contexts---high visibility and
technological capability--- become liabilities in a wartime
scenario.]{.underline}**149 China will unquestionably target these
weapons in the earliest stages of a conflict. Moreover, because advanced
conventional platforms are expensive, budget constraints and political
realities mean that Taiwan cannot afford large numbers of
high-performance conventional weapons. **[China will find it relatively
easy to locate, target, and destroy most of them before they can "get
into action."]{.underline}** Second, **[China cannot compel Taiwan via
grey zone operations alone. Although China can use]{.underline}** grey
zone **[provocations to influence public opinion, to challenge Taiwan's
red lines, or to collect intelligence, they do not existentially
threaten Taiwan.]{.underline}** China can invade Taiwan without
conducting grey zone operations, but the reverse is not true. Third,
**[it may be in Taiwan's best interests to let China engage in some grey
zone operations. China likely prefers grey zone challenges because it
wants to avoid the risk of a conflict that escalates out of control. If
China's leaders think Taiwan has effectively eliminated the grey zone,
then they may become more willing to engage in more escalatory types of
actions.]{.underline}** Some readers might argue that ceding in the grey
zone would only whet China's appetite. Alternatively, they might assert
that doing so would create new operational advantages for China such
that it would be better positioned to launch the inevitable assault. We
find such rebuttals unpersuasive. To begin with, Taiwan does not face
the same uncertainty as British leaders might have faced when they met
with their Nazi counterparts in Munich in 1938. As far as we are
concerned, China has unlimited aims with respect to Taiwan.
**[Taiwan]{.underline}** should definitely not cede the grey zone in the
belief that doing so would placate China. Rather, it should cede the
grey zone because it **[faces major opportunity costs in decisions
regarding its force posture. In a resource-constrained world, every NT
spent on small numbers of expensive conventional platforms for
demonstrating resolve]{.underline}** and responding to grey zone
challenges is an NT that **[cannot be used to develop and field large
numbers of unconventional capabilities that deter against
invasion]{.underline}** because too many of them would exist for China
to knock them out. Moreover, ceding the grey zone could enhance
deterrence if done correctly. Taiwan could express itself more clearly
and credibly that it will defend its vital interests. **[By pursuing
more militarily effective investments, Taiwan could make China pay a
much higher price if it mounts a large-scale assault.]{.underline}** We
thus recommend that Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense rebalance its
force modernization plans. It should consider maintaining just enough
conventional capability to 'push back' against grey zone aggression. By
reducing or eliminating investments in producing and acquiring new
conventional weapons systems, Taiwan can free additional resources to
invest in a wide range of truly unconventional counterinvasion weapons
and capabilities.

#### And, offensive Arms sales aren't effective deterrents -- the plan's reduction would signal a change in U.S. posture or affect China or Taiwan's perception of U.S. commitment but boost relations

**Chen et al. 17** \[Ping-Kuei, assistant professor at the Department of
Diplomacy, National Chengchi University, Taiwan, Scott L. Kastner,

The analysis above suggests that ending arms sales to Taiwan would be
destabilizing if doing so had enough of an effect on p and cc to push R
to the right of the status quo. However, there are reasons to question
whether ending sales would indeed have such a large effect. On the one
hand, **[as the balance of power in the Taiwan Strait continues to shift
in China's favor]{.underline}**, **[it is not obvious that the arms
themselves have a large impact on that shifting power
balance]{.underline}**. **[Whether the sales do in fact have a
significant effect]{.underline}** in this regard, moreover,
**[will]{.underline}** likely **[depend]{.underline}** heavily **[on the
types of weapons the United States would be willing to sell to
Taiwan]{.underline}** (and which weapons Taiwan would be willing to
buy). For instance, some have suggested that Taiwan's efforts to
purchase high-profile and **[expensive packages]{.underline}** **[such
as the F-16]{.underline}**C/D **[fighter are
counterproductive]{.underline}** **[given their high cost and the PRC's
growing air capabilities]{.underline}**; according to these analysts,
**[more mundane]{.underline}** (and cheaper) **[systems are likely to be
more effective at countering PRC capabilities]{.underline}**. **[Whether
ending arms sales has a significant effect]{.underline}** on p and cc ,
then, **[will hinge]{.underline}** in part **[on what types of weapons
the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[would sell Taiwan
if arms sales were to continue]{.underline}**. Likewise, **[it is not
self-evident how large of a signaling effect arms sales
have]{.underline}**. As we show in the next section, **[US arms sales
send the clearest signal of US support for Taiwan when the sales are
costly for the United States to undertake]{.underline}**. Yet **[it is
quite clear not only that the sales do not appear to be]{.underline}**
especially **[costly for Washington but also that many]{.underline}** in
the United States actually **[benefit]{.underline}** economically and
politically **[from the sales]{.underline}**. When the Obama
administration was considering the F-16C/D package in 2011, for
instance, a large number of US senators signed a letter to the president
urging the sale to go forward; often, the signatories represented states
that stood to benefit economically from increased demand for the fighter
jets.21 In other words, **[so long as Chinese retaliation against the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[for selling weapons
remains limited]{.underline}**, **[the costs of the policy to Washington
do not appear especially high]{.underline}**. Thus **[it would not
appear to us that arms sales represent an especially strong
signal]{.underline}** **[of US commitment to Taiwan]{.underline}**,
**[meaning that ending the sales would not necessarily lead Taiwan and
China to dramatically alter their assessments of likely US behavior in
the event of a cross-Strait conflict]{.underline}**. It is also worth
emphasizing that many factors besides US arms sales to Taiwan determine
the value of p and cc , including Taiwan's indigenous military
capabilities, the PRC's capabilities, the level of economic integration
across the Taiwan Strait, and so forth. **[The rapid growth in
cross-Strait economic integration and cooperation]{.underline}** in
recent decades, **[combined with China's]{.underline}** general
**[integration into global markets]{.underline}**, for instance,
**[suggests that the costs for China of a cross-Strait military
confrontation are probably quite high]{.underline}**---**[even if the
PRC would likely win such a confrontation]{.underline}**. **[Compared to
these costs]{.underline}**, **[the dent]{.underline}** to cc **[caused
by reduced arms sales could actually be quite small]{.underline}**.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, ending arms sales to Taiwan could
actually increase cc in some ways. While critics sometimes suggest that
ending arms sales might simply whet the appetite of China and encourage
further demands on the United States, it is also conceivable---as
proponents such as Glaser argue---that **[ending arms sales would lead
to significant improvement in the US-China relationship]{.underline}**.
Furthermore, **[whether the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[sells weapons to Taiwan or
not]{.underline}**, **[it is hard to imagine a strong and cooperative
US-China relationship withstanding PRC coercion against the
island]{.underline}**. Therefore, **[if the PRC values a stable US-China
relationship]{.underline}**, **[and if ending arms sales to Taiwan does
in fact lead to an improved Sino-American relationship]{.underline}**,
**[then ending arms sales to Taiwan will]{.underline}** also **[mean
that the PRC will have more to lose]{.underline}** (in terms of a strong
US-China relationship) **[by initiating conflict]{.underline}** in the
Taiwan Strait. If this sort of effect outweighs the direct effect of
ending arms sales on China's costs of war, then **[ending arms sales
could help to reinforce a stable status quo]{.underline}**.

**[The time has come for the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[to consider ending the sale of upgrades for
F-16 fighter aircraft to Taiwan and instead shift military
sales]{.underline}** and cooperation **[to emphasize anti-access
capabilities and concepts of operation]{.underline}**. U.S. policy
toward Taiwan has always been a delicate dance. The United States
supports a "one China" policy and it maintains a strategic relationship
with Beijing, but Washington is legislatively required to support
Taiwan's "sufficient self-defense capabilities" thanks to the Taiwan
Relations Act. A certain amount of diplomatic savvy is required to
simultaneously pursue such seemingly contradictory policies. Against
this backdrop, **[decisions relating to F-16 sales have become a leading
indicator of U.S. intentions vis-à-vis Beijing and
Taipei.]{.underline}** **[If the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[sells new F-16s to Taiwan, Beijing may
perceive it as a threat to the Sino-U.S. strategic
relationship]{.underline}** and the PRC's position in the region. **[If
the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[refuses to arm
Taiwan at all, it would not only be found in violation of
the]{.underline}** **[T]{.underline}**aiwan **[R]{.underline}**elations
**[A]{.underline}**ct, **[but Taiwan would then be forced to make the
grand strategic assumption that it no longer has U.S.
support]{.underline}**. The Obama administration has continued the
delicate dance of its predecessors, offering an interim solution of not
shipping F-16s to Taiwan but instead offering to help modernize Taiwan's
existing fleet. **[Such a Goldilocks solution has helped keep the peace,
but it cannot continue indefinitely]{.underline}**. **[F-16s are already
outmoded by current generation fighters,]{.underline}** and there are
realistic limits to how much you can simply maintain and upgrade an
existing fleet as it ages; eventually new kit will be necessary. Yet by
the time the United States is "forced" **[to again sell F-16s to
Taiwan]{.underline}**, it will inevitably be in the context of having
refrained from selling Taiwan F-16s for decades --- this **[will
predictably stir the ire of Beijing, far more so than if U.S.
administrations had simply sold new F-16s to Taipei
regularly]{.underline}**. **[But there's an even bigger problem with the
kabuki theater surrounding F-16 sales and upgrades]{.underline}** ---
**[it's a feckless capability that in fact does not provide Taiwan with
"sufficient self-defense capabilities,]{.underline}**" as law requires.
**[The reality of the military balance between the PRC and Taiwan is
that the former overwhelms the latter in the air]{.underline}**. Taiwan
has no chance of air superiority on its own. So **[arming Taiwan with
inferior fighters in fewer numbers than their most likely adversary
doesn't restore a military balance in the air domain]{.underline}**;
**[it quixotically wastes Taiwan's limited defense
budget]{.underline}**. **[China has long been opposed to F-16 sales to
Taiwan]{.underline}**, and more vocal about it than other categories of
arms sales. So, **[I say, offer this symbolic concession for the sake of
Sino-U.S. relations,]{.underline}** **[but do it in parallel with a
shift in the U.S.-Taiwan defense program]{.underline}**. As I've argued
before Congress and in recent policy analysis for the Center for a New
American Security and the National Bureau of Asian Research, **[helping
allies and partners in Asia move toward a more defensive military
orientation can be more cost effective than trying to ensure
offense-dominance]{.underline}**, **[and it puts the region on a more
stable footing. This logic applies to Taiwan as well]{.underline}**.
**[Taiwan's ability to defend itself doesn't require the ability to
project power]{.underline}** or achieve superiority in any warfighting
domain; that's a very U.S.-centric construct for how to win in combat.
**[Instead, Taiwan defense requires denying a larger and more advanced
adversary its objectives]{.underline}**. **[For Taiwan, the most
efficient means of doing so is through an anti-access military strategy
that strings together relatively low-cost systems --- such as undersea
mines, drones, air and missile defense]{.underline}**, **[and land-based
anti-ship cruise missiles]{.underline}**, to name a few **[--- with
defensively minded concepts of operation designed to nullify PRC
advantages]{.underline}** or impose costs on any attempts by the PRC to
project power. **[The F-16 dance puts U.S. policy in a precarious
position, and is eventually destined to become the worst of both worlds:
angering Beijing while failing to actually equip Taiwan with what it
needs]{.underline}**. Taiwan's security is best assured by being less
tiger and more turtle. Such a shift doesn't require F-16s; it requires
an anti-access strategy.

### Internals: Xi Cred

#### The sale is a big policy shift that will humiliate Xi

**Lee 19** - senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, (John, "Why a US
Sale of Fighter Jets to Taiwan Matters,"
<https://thediplomat.com/2019/04/why-a-us-sale-of-fighter-jets-to-taiwan-matters/>,
EM)

In the lead-up to the 1996 Taiwanese presidential elections, mainland
China conducted a series of missile tests to express its displeasure
against the pro-independence leanings of then-leader Lee Teng-hui and
impress on the Taiwanese electorate that returning Lee to office might
lead to war. The United States' response to the so-called [Third Taiwan
Strait
Crisis](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-third-taiwan-strait-crisis-the-forgotten-showdown-19742),
which was to order two aircraft carrier groups to the area, did the
trick. The largest display of American military might since the Vietnam
War forced a humiliating Chinese backdown and persuaded Beijing it
needed to modernize its military to counter the U.S. Navy. The Chinese
move also backfired as Lee's popularity in Taiwan gained a shot in the
arm for standing up to the mainland. Back in 1996, China's [military
budget](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/SIPRI-Milex-data-1949-2017.xlsx)
was only about twice that of Taiwan's and approximately 16 times smaller
than that of the United States. Today, the People's Liberation Army's
(PLA) budget is almost 22 times larger than Taiwan's and over one-third
that of the United States. China's advanced short-range ballistic
missile could destroy every runway attached to Taiwan's six air force
bases and destroy almost all Taiwanese fighter planes in the early
moments of a war. The PLA has established superiority over Taiwan in the
air, and on and under the water. The only thing the PLA cannot achieve
is landing troops on Taiwan without suffering unacceptable losses. In
late March, [Bloomberg
reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-21/trump-aides-said-to-back-selling-f-16-fighter-planes-to-taiwan)
that U.S. President Donald **[Trump's advisers]{.underline}** had
**[encouraged Taiwan to submit a formal request to buy up]{.underline}**
to **[60 advanced F-16V]{.underline}** fighter **[planes.]{.underline}**
Any sale must still be approved by Congress and **[would be the first
major aircraft purchase]{.underline}** from the United States by Taiwan
**[since 1992. During her visit to Hawaii last week, Taiwanese President
Tsai Ing-wen confirmed that Taiwan had requested a purchase of new
fighter jets from the United States. Days later, two Chinese fighter
planes crossed the median line in the Taiwan Strait that divides China
and Taiwan -- the first time this has occurred for 20
years.]{.underline}** Even if the F-16V sale goes ahead, **[Taiwan's new
planes will not alter the military balance between China and Taiwan, nor
dissuade the mainland from further provocations]{.underline}** such as
the median line flyover. **[That is not Beijing's primary concern,
however. The most important calculation]{.underline}** China must make
**[is not the relative capabilities]{.underline}** of the Taiwanese
armed forces **[but how the United States will respond in the event of a
crisis]{.underline}** or conflict **[in the Taiwan Strait. Every
clue]{.underline}** with respect to uncovering U.S. intention **[is
vital because U.S. intervention could tip the military balance against
China]{.underline}** in any such conflict. In any event, it guarantees
the end of any "acceptable cost" outcome in the event of conflict for
China. Under the United States' 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, any attempt
to forcibly determine Taiwan's future is considered "a threat to peace
and security of the Western Pacific and of grave concern to the United
States." To prevent that, **[Washington is obligated to sell "arms of a
defensive character" to]{.underline}** Taipei to allow the latter to
defend itself and **[dissuade China from launching any military action.
Since the Bill Clinton era, administrations have denied Taiwan's request
to purchase new fighter planes on the basis that the grey line from
"defense" to "offense" might be crossed.]{.underline}** Speaking from
Hawaii, **[Tsai let the cat out of the bag [when she
said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/taiwans-tsai-confirms-request-to-buy-new-us-fighters-tanks/2019/03/28/f0af9308-510f-11e9-bdb7-44f948cc0605_story.html?utm_term=.d18767084612)
the purchase of advanced fourth generation fighters would "greatly
enhance our land and air capabilities, strengthen military moral and
show to the world the U.S. commitment to Taiwan's defense." It is the
last line which sends shivers down the spine of mainland
leaders.]{.underline}** Since the Taiwan Relations Act came into force,
**[the United States has deliberately embarked on a policy of "strategic
ambiguity"]{.underline}** with respect to its military commitments to
Taiwan in the event the latter is attacked. **[Whether the United States
intervenes is a matter of political judgment and strategic assessment.
Under the Barack Obama administration, the decision to only offer Taipei
upgrades to its aging F-16 A/B planes suggested to Beijing that
de-escalating tensions arising from differences over Taiwan was the
predominant mindset. In contrast, the Trump administration has shown
unprecedented willingness to escalate tensions with China over
political, strategic, and economic differences.]{.underline}** The
speech by Vice President Mike Pence last October at the Hudson Institute
and the 2017 National Security Strategy pulled no punches in identifying
China as a comprehensive rival to the United States. **[If the sale of
F-16V planes goes through, then, it is evidence that the mindset in
Washington with respect to Taiwan has also changed and is less accepting
of mainland sensibilities and demands. Such a sale would be an
indication that preserving de facto Taiwanese independence is once more
considered critical to U.S. and allied strategy when it comes to keeping
the PLA confined to inside the so-called First Island Chain. That would
be a significant blow to Chinese President Xi Jinping's plans. In a
wide-ranging speech]{.underline}** on Taiwan in January to mark the 40th
anniversary of the "Message to Compatriots in Taiwan" **[delivered to
the 1978 National People's Congress, Xi implied that "reunification"
with Taiwan was a "historic task" he wanted to achieve during his
tenure. A U.S. sale of F-16Vs to Taiwan --- and all it implies --- makes
fulfillment of that task less likely.]{.underline}** Finally, the
strength of American support for Taiwan will influence how other nations
respond to persistent Chinese attempts to reduce international space
within which Taiwan can act as a de facto sovereign entity. The most
important regional relationship for Taiwan is with Japan, which has
emerged under Shinzo Abe as the political, strategic, and economic
leader among democratic Asian nations. On issues such as the
Trans-Pacific Partnership, Tokyo has shown initiative when Washington
has been found wanting. The Japanese leader has emerged as one of the
few regional countries to have established a strong personal
relationship with Taiwan's Tsai and is widely seen as the most
pro-Taiwan leaders amongst U.S. allies in the region. Even then, Abe's
room to move is dependent on the extent to which the United States is
willing to defend Taipei's desire to behave as a de facto sovereign
entity. If it is confirmed that Washington is moving to a more robust
approach with respect to cross-strait relations, Japan, Australia and
others will follow. Xi is already under internal pressure from the
global pushback against his flagship policies such as the Belt and Road
Initiative and "Made in China 2025." China has lost goodwill with
neighboring states over its actions in the East and South China Seas and
along the disputed border with India. It is in the middle of an economic
war with the United States while the European Union and Japan are openly
criticizing China for violations of economic rules and norms, including
the systematic theft of intellectual property by Chinese state-owned
firms and "national champions." Xi took a great risk in abandoning the
rhetoric and diplomacy of China's "peaceful rise," which was promulgated
by his predecessor Hu Jintao. Previously admired for his iron
determination to achieve China's great "rejuvenation," **[Xi is now
being criticized domestically]{.underline}** for overreach and
miscalculation. **[It is speculated that the legitimacy of the Communist
Party would not survive the "loss" of Taiwan. If the United States goes
ahead with the sale of F-16Vs to Taiwan, then the pressure on a
president who has embarked on an unprecedented "anti-corruption
campaign" to silence political enemies and doubters will be
immense.]{.underline}**

### AT: Jets Good

#### Jets have minimal operational utility - yet they constitute a political nightmare for Beijing 

**McLeary 19** (Paul,

it **[sent a letter of request]{.underline}** to Washington **[to buy 66
F-16V fighter jets]{.underline}** from Lockheed Martin, which would give
the small independent island a fleet of the most advanced 4th generation
fighters in the world. If the deal goes through, it would be **[the

the Trump administration would sign off on the deal while it is involved
in delicate trade negotiations with Beijing. **[There is]{.underline}**
also **[the question of what role the F-16s could play in any potential
conflict with China. Facing off against China's]{.underline}** J-20 and
J-31 **[5th generation fighters may be]{.underline}** a **[daunting
task, and the F-16s would]{.underline}** likely **[be]{.underline}**
useful "in less than all-out scenarios, but probably highly
**[vulnerable in an early, all-out missile strike and aerial
bombardment]{.underline}**," said Scott Harold, associate director of
the RAND Center for Asia Pacific Policy. "**[Beijing will kvetch about
anything]{.underline}**," Harold added, "**[but]{.underline}** would
probably complain **[more about F-16Vs primarily because these would
be]{.underline}** a **[politically embarrassing]{.underline}** sale
**[for Beijing.]{.underline}**" **[The Stinger sale, however, might be
an indication that Taiwan is truly adopting a more asymmetric
approach]{.underline}** to self-defense, as the shoulder-launched weapon
is easily moved and allows soldiers to fire and flee quickly. While the
\$2 billion spent on Abrams tanks has raised some eyebrows --- "you
would struggle to find anyone that can make an operational case for the
tank sale," said Eric Sayers, an Indo-Pacific export at the CNAS
thinktank here-- it's still "another positive sign of how arms sales are
moving away from the large package approach of Bush and Obama and
towards considering Taiwan's requests on a case by case basis." More
**[critical for]{.underline}** Taiwan's self-defense and **[deterrent
capability are ground-to-air weapons, submarines, and electronic warfare
systems.]{.underline}** "I could find a more effective way to spend a
billion dollars -- a huge portion of Taipei's \$11 billion defense
budget -- to enhance cross-strait deterrence," Sayers added. The
Stingers are more intriguing however, and "are a great weapon if they
can target the PLA's airframes," Harold said, "though I don't know how
effective they would be against stealthy platforms like the J-20 or
J-31." The sales, and the debate over shipping the F-16Vs to Taiwan,
comes amid a regular stream of US warships sailing in international
waters between Taiwan and mainland China, and just as US, Australian,
Japanese, and Canadian forces kick off the massive Talisman Sabre 2019
exercise.

## Deterrence

### Deterrence Collapse/Pivot k

#### Taiwanese deterrence is collapsing - only a pivot to elastic denial-in-depth can stave off an attack

**Hunzeker and Lanoszka 18** (Michael and Alexander,
<http://csps.gmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/A-Question-of-Time.pdf>,
EM)

**[The cornerstone of any deterrence posture is its ability to impose
unacceptable costs on an adversary]{.underline}** if it attempts to
attack, either through denial or punishment. **[To date, Taiwan has
largely hedged in a manner that emphasizes high-end, highvisibility
platforms, largely on the assumption that]{.underline}** the
international community in general---and **[the United
States]{.underline}** in particular---**[will intervene in a worst-case
invasion scenario. We think this assumption is dangerous]{.underline}**
for reasons already discussed. **[Moreover, although China might appear
content with maintaining the status quo for now, its strategic calculus
is surely based, in part, on its beliefs about Taiwan's ability to
impose unacceptable costs on an invasion force.]{.underline}** **[To the
degree that Taiwan continues over-investing in a small number of
expensive and exquisite platforms, it will likely continue to find
itself at both a qualitative and quantitative disadvantage. The more the
gap widens, the more Chinese leaders may be tempted to resolve the
"Taiwan problem" by force of arms.]{.underline}** To develop a more
effective conventional deterrence posture, Taiwan must ruthlessly
question its assumptions about China. For example, three assumptions
frequently came up during our interviews. Each is problematic. The first
assumption is that China does not need to be deterred. According to this
line of reasoning, Chinese leaders are unwilling to use force against
Taiwan because they are more interested in economic advancement and
increasing their power ahead of any military confrontation. **[The
problem is that Chinese calculations can change over time, and Taiwan
cannot take it for granted that China will remain internally focused.
Taiwan must prepare now to sufficiently deter China. A second assumption
is two-fold: that the United States will intervene and that receipt of
the latest U.S. weaponry signals U.S. resolve to China. This assumption
is perhaps even more dangerous because determining exactly how the
United States might respond to an invasion scenario is difficult. The
United States has long maintained a policy of "strategic
ambiguity."]{.underline}** Although some scholars point to a
historically robust amount of weapons sales to Taiwan since 2008 as
evidence of deterrence, others suggest that the United States strives to
avoid direct military intervention.172 **[The fact of the matter is that
it is anyone's guess whether the United States would risk nuclear
conflict with China over Taiwan. At a minimum, enough uncertainty
surrounds how the United States might react that Taiwan's defense
planners should not build Taiwan's deterrence posture on the assumption
that the United States can--- or will---intervene]{.underline}**. The
third assumption is that the most advanced fighter jets patrolling the
skies will embolden the population to keep up the fight. Polling already
indicates more than 30% of those in Taiwan do not think military force
should even be used to stop China from reunifying. As discussed in the
last chapter, little evidence suggests Taiwan will be able to launch
their fighters in the midst of a conflict.173 Perhaps more accurately,
however, a number of officials pointed to China's fear as the primary
source of deterrence. During the interviews, a number of political,
military, and academic leaders suggested **[Chinese government
officials]{.underline}** were self deterred because they **[are afraid
of a long, drawn out conflict and the uncertainty it would
create.]{.underline}** After all, the longer a military conflict with
Taiwan drags on, the more likely it is that the United States will
intervene. Those interviewed also indicated Chinese leaders might also
be afraid of domestic unrest in response to high numbers of casualties,
potentially exacerbated by the one-child policy, which might make
Chinese families particularly casualty-averse. **[With this in mind, the
following discussion focuses on lengthening any potential conflict and
causing high rates of casualties on the invading force.]{.underline}**
Ideally, with effective signaling to China, these recommendations would
lower the probability of conflict. **[We]{.underline}** again
**[recommend that Taiwan rebalance its investments to emphasize its
war-fighting capabilities even if this shift constrains its ability to
counter]{.underline}** Chinese **[provocations in the grey
zone.]{.underline}** We think that it makes more sense for Taiwan to
accept risk in its peacetime presence, because such capabilities will
not deter China from invading. Of course, as argued in the preceding
chapter, Taiwan cannot and should not completely divest itself of all of
its high-end air and naval platforms, since these have an important role
to play in countering China's most likely threats.174 However, we
believe that **[Taiwan can "do more with less]{.underline}**" in this
area. **[Cutting investment]{.underline}** in the IDS program,
Aegis-like destroyers, and the amphibious shipping force **[will yield
more resources to invest in truly asymmetric capabilities. Ultimately,
Taiwan is better off deterring a worst-case invasion---even if it means
living with increased grey zone incursion---than the other way
around.]{.underline}** And a military optimized to counter grey zone
threats will be particularly vulnerable to an invasion scenario. Beyond
emphasizing its war-fighting capabilities over its grey zone
capabilities, **[we believe that Taiwan should focus on acquiring a
particular set of weapons and on developing a particular set of
strategies for using them. Specifically, we argue that Taiwan should
primarily invest in an unconventional force structure, which it should
plan to employ asymmetrically. We call this approach "elastic
denial-in-depth."]{.underline}** It is built around the use of an
unconventional layered force posture that **[emphasizes four denial
zones: in the air, at sea, on the ground, and within
society.]{.underline}** In the air and at sea, **[Taiwan should focus on
acquiring large numbers of relatively low-cost, dedicated
counterinvasion capabilities. On the ground, active duty army and
repurposed marine forces should prepare for long-range coastal defense,
counterattack, and fighting retrograde missions. Finally, we suggest
that Taiwan begin serious planning for social denial. In practical
terms, Taiwan should restructure its sizeable reserve force to prepare
it to conduct a prolonged insurgency campaign in urban, jungle, and
mountain settings.]{.underline}** While this strategy is primarily
concerned with deterring an invasion of Taiwan itself, the capabilities
recommended above will also be effective in preventing a smaller land
grab of Taiwan's outlying islands.  Although such an attempt would
constitute a substantial escalation, China could potentially seize the
outlying islands to improve invasion staging or to exert political
pressure on the Taiwanese government.  Ultimately, these outlying
islands will remain vulnerable and well inside China's A2/AD envelope,
so hardening the islands with dispersed, asymmetric defenses (the same
ones recommended for Taiwan itself ) to impose costs on any potential
invasion will maximize Taiwan's ability to deter such a land grab. It is
also important to remember that the loss of its outlying islands will
not represent an existential threat to Taiwan. **[Although Taiwan
already possesses many of the capabilities needed to execute this
layered, asymmetric, and unconventional approach, they are not currently
fielded as part of a holistic and integrated strategy. These
capabilities can include not only traditional forces such as mobile air
defense and antiaircraft missile launchers but also transformative
technologies such as 3D printing and drones]{.underline}** in addition
to a comprehensive restructuring of their Reserve Command.

#### Policymakers ought to tolerate grey zone intrusions - the alternative is an outright invasion 

**Hunzeker and Lanoszka 18** (Michael and Alexander,
<http://csps.gmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/A-Question-of-Time.pdf>,
EM)

**[China seems to prefer]{.underline}** challenging Taiwan in **[the
grey zone.]{.underline}** For the foreseeable future, provocations,
subversion, and disinformation will remain a more likely threat than
missile strikes, a naval blockade, or an invasion. To counter this grey
zone challenge, Taiwan needs conventional platforms that can operate in
a permissive, peacetime environment. Most U.S. analysts who propose that
Taiwan should focus on acquiring unconventional platforms tend to
overlook this need, forgetting that weapons systems and platforms are
often as useful for performing political and symbolic roles as they are
for war-fighting purposes. With respect to the grey zone threat, open
ocean-going ships, modern fighter jets, and other conventional weapons
signal resolve to domestic and international audiences. Moreover,
conventional weapons fill this important role in a way that
unconventional systems such as missiles, mines, and patrol boats cannot.
For these reasons, Taiwan's Navy and Air Force should not pursue a
purely unconventional/asymmetric naval and air posture. Taiwan must
maintain an inventory of conventional ships and fighter aircraft to
counter China in the grey zone. **[And yet Taiwan should not invest too
much in conventional air and naval force structure.]{.underline}**
First, **[Taiwan is already well within the range of China's longrange
strike systems. The characteristics that make conventional ships and
fighter jets valuable in grey zone contexts---high visibility and
technological capability--- become liabilities in a wartime
scenario.]{.underline}**149 China will unquestionably target these
weapons in the earliest stages of a conflict. Moreover, because advanced
conventional platforms are expensive, budget constraints and political
realities mean that Taiwan cannot afford large numbers of
high-performance conventional weapons. **[China will find it relatively
easy to locate, target, and destroy most of them before they can "get
into action."]{.underline}** Second, **[China cannot compel Taiwan via
grey zone operations alone. Although China can use]{.underline}** grey
zone **[provocations to influence public opinion, to challenge Taiwan's
red lines, or to collect intelligence, they do not existentially
threaten Taiwan.]{.underline}** China can invade Taiwan without
conducting grey zone operations, but the reverse is not true. Third,
**[it may be in Taiwan's best interests to let China engage in some grey
zone operations. China likely prefers grey zone challenges because it
wants to avoid the risk of a conflict that escalates out of control. If
China's leaders think Taiwan has effectively eliminated the grey zone,
then they may become more willing to engage in more escalatory types of
actions.]{.underline}** Some readers might argue that ceding in the grey
zone would only whet China's appetite. Alternatively, they might assert
that doing so would create new operational advantages for China such
that it would be better positioned to launch the inevitable assault. We
find such rebuttals unpersuasive. To begin with, Taiwan does not face
the same uncertainty as British leaders might have faced when they met
with their Nazi counterparts in Munich in 1938. As far as we are
concerned, China has unlimited aims with respect to Taiwan.
**[Taiwan]{.underline}** should definitely not cede the grey zone in the
belief that doing so would placate China. Rather, it should cede the
grey zone because it **[faces major opportunity costs in decisions
regarding its force posture. In a resource-constrained world, every NT
spent on small numbers of expensive conventional platforms for
demonstrating resolve]{.underline}** and responding to grey zone
challenges is an NT that **[cannot be used to develop and field large
numbers of unconventional capabilities that deter against
invasion]{.underline}** because too many of them would exist for China
to knock them out. Moreover, ceding the grey zone could enhance
deterrence if done correctly. Taiwan could express itself more clearly
and credibly that it will defend its vital interests. **[By pursuing
more militarily effective investments, Taiwan could make China pay a
much higher price if it mounts a large-scale assault.]{.underline}** We
thus recommend that Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense rebalance its
force modernization plans. It should consider maintaining just enough
conventional capability to 'push back' against grey zone aggression. By
reducing or eliminating investments in producing and acquiring new
conventional weapons systems, Taiwan can free additional resources to
invest in a wide range of truly unconventional counterinvasion weapons
and capabilities.

#### Arms sales are an ineffective "costly signal" 

**Hunzeker and Lanoszka 18** (Michael and Alexander,
<http://csps.gmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/A-Question-of-Time.pdf>,
EM)

The second argument concerns signaling. **[A number of interviewees
suggested that when the United States sells advanced aircraft to Taiwan,
it sends a clear signal to China that the United States will intervene
in a conflict.]{.underline}** As one interviewee succinctly put the
matter, **["when you sell us the latest fighters, it lets China know
America would intervene on our behalf in a conflict." In essence, the
argument is a variation on the theory of "costly
signaling."]{.underline}** This theory implies that the best way for a
state (like the United States) to signal credibly that it really will
make good on a threat (such as coming to the aid of an ally or partner)
is to engage in actions that are expensive to undertake. The logic is
that a state would not incur those costs unless it is actually willing
to carry out the threat.153 When the United States wants to credibly
signal that it will intervene on an ally's behalf, it usually does
things like base American troops on an ally's territory. Such actions
are costly both in terms of financial expense and the fact that forward
deployed troops may not be available for other contingencies. The fact
that the United States is willing to bear these costs tells potential
adversaries it is serious about acting to protect its ally. **[There
are]{.underline}** two **[problems with treating]{.underline}** the sale
of **[advanced fighter jets like a "costly signal."]{.underline}**
First, the idea that Taiwan should buy expensive fighter jets to
buttress public resolve overlooks the opportunity cost associated with
such a strategy. Ideally, Taiwan would have a defense budget large
enough to afford a sufficient number of advanced fighter jets to both
maintain parity with the PLAAF and to ensure that a large number could
survive the missile strikes that will surely precede any invasion
attempt. Unfortunately, Taiwan's defense budget is severely constrained.
It already spends 12.6% of its defense budget just to maintain and
operate the F-16s, F-CKs, and Mirages that it already has.154 Buying and
maintaining the F-35 would prove even more costly. Thus, even if every
NT spent on advanced fighter aircraft enhances public resolve, that
resolve comes at a severe cost to actual war-fighting capability. Worse
yet, **[the strategy of trading resolve for capability could easily
backfire.]{.underline}** Few things will sap citizens' collective will
in a war than seeing their limited arsenal of exquisite weapons
destroyed in their bunkers or in the skies over Taipei. Second, **[it is
not clear that selling weapons to a partner necessarily makes it more
likely that the seller is then willing to fight a war on its buyer's
behalf.]{.underline}**155 **[Weapons sales are the opposite of a costly
signal, because selling weapons is actually quite profitable. Since
Chinese leaders know the United States makes money on weapons sales,
they might believe that weapons sales signal little more than a U.S.
President's desire to support America's defense
industries.]{.underline}** To be fair, Taiwan's leaders likely see
weapons sales as the next best alternative to basing U.S. troops in
Taiwan, since cross-Strait dynamics seem to prevent the United States
from sending traditional costly signals. Nor are weapons sales costless
for the United States. At a minimum, they demonstrate that the United
States is willing to tolerate the Chinese indignation and retaliation
that usually follow each U.S.-Taiwan foreign military sales
announcement. Nevertheless, **[we think it is risky for Taiwan to spend
its limited defense budget on expensive U.S. weapons systems on the
tenuous assumption that it signals American willingness to go to war on
Taiwan's behalf.]{.underline}** The issue of whether the United States
would intervene in a war between Taiwan and China remains contentious.
**[From a historical perspective, the U.S. commitment to Taiwan has been
waning from the days of the Mutual Defense Treaty with Taiwan. Although
public and elite opinion on the matter has ebbed and flowed over the
past four decades, the general trend appears to cast increasing doubt on
U.S. intervention.]{.underline}** Many U.S. citizens appear to think
that the United States should use Taiwan as a bargaining chip to improve
relations with China.156

### No Asymmetry Strategy Now

An Asymmetric Approach **[It is not new to suggest that the ROCArF could
benefit from adopting a more asymmetric military posture.]{.underline}**
**[Instead of expending great amounts of wealth on purchasing and
operating hundreds of fighter aircraft, that monetary amount could
instead be used to buy a larger number of highly mobile SAMs and radar
systems]{.underline}**. Crew and costs meant for two dozen major surface
combatants could instead be used for large number of highly mobile land
based AShMs, small fast attack missile boats, minelayers, and perhaps
even miniature submarines. **[The military goal of an asymmetric
warfighting strategy would be to exact the greatest amount of casualties
from the PLA in event of a conflict]{.underline}**. Asymmetric forces
tend to be smaller in terms of logistics footprint, more mobile, and
greater in number than conventional forces. For example**[, a tactical
fighter wing presents a much larger target than spending the equivalent
amount of money on multiple mobile SAM units]{.underline}**. **[For the
ROCArF, adopting an asymmetric military posture should theoretically
complicate PLA targeting against ROCArF forces due to the greater number
of individual units, smaller size and logistics footprint, and overall
lower visibility that asymmetric forces tend to enjoy]{.underline}**. It
would also make sense for the ROCArF to develop their Army and ground
forces in a manner that seeks to exact maximal casualties in the event
of a successful PLA amphibious invasion, at a beneficial opportunity
cost for Taiwan. **[This could mean purchasing a greater number of man
portable anti-tank missiles such as Javelin in lieu of additional attack
helicopters or main battle tanks]{.underline}**. **[If the political and
societal will is present during peacetime, it could also mean seeking to
mobilize more of Taiwan's population to be willing to fight an
asymmetric ground campaign including large-scale urban
warfare]{.underline}**, where the PLA is less able to bring firepower
superiority and advantages in ISR into play. Politics of Asymmetry No
military is ever "fully" asymmetric or ever "fully" conventional or
symmetric. **[It is very possible for the ROCArF to seek a balance
between more asymmetric capabilities while retaining some conventional
forces as well.]{.underline}** For regular peacetime duties, it is
likely that a fleet of fighter aircraft will be necessary for airspace
policing and a regular surface naval force necessary for having a
presence at sea in Taiwan's territories and near maritime features that
it claims. **[However the degree to which expenditure on conventional
forces may be otherwise spent on asymmetric forces is also very much a
political question with potential repercussions on Taiwan society and
morale]{.underline}**. For most of its modern history, the Republic of
China has enjoyed a significant degree of qualitative military
superiority against the forces of the PLA. The PLA may have enjoyed an
overall quantitative military advantage in domains such as manpower and
ship count; **[however, the overall balance of combined qualitative and
quantitative forces was such that the ROCArF until recently would have
enjoyed very beneficial kill/loss ratios and forced the PLA to lose
substantial numbers of qualitatively inferior aircraft and ships in
event of a conflict]{.underline}**. **[Adopting a more asymmetric
military force would likely require a certain level of political courage
and societal resilience]{.underline}**, because the cultural and social
effects of having such a military is effectively an admission that
possessing a conventional force may be more detrimental to Taiwan's
military goals. The effect of adopting an asymmetric force on the morale
and resolve of Taiwan's populace to fight a conflict with China would
have to be carefully monitored. No military in the world chooses to
adopt an asymmetric force if they possess the political will, wealth,
and technology to develop a conventional force that can prevail against
the enemy. Instead, asymmetric strategies become necessary to improve
one's survivability in the face of superior conventional forces from the
opposing side, but **[it is also an admission that significant
casualties may also be expected]{.underline}**. **[Current and
foreseeable ROCArF military procurement has sent mixed signals as to
their commitment to asymmetry, despite government white papers publicly
declaring the intent to adopt asymmetry.]{.underline}** Some recent
efforts such as developing a new small displacement fast attack boat are
consistent with an asymmetrical posture, but other **[indicators are
not, such as some recent ROCN aspirations to develop a new generation of
destroyers and frigates and even amphibious assault ships like
LPDs]{.underline}**. The program to develop indigenous SSKs is also
likely to be costly, given the intended goal at this stage is to create
proper SSKs displacing up to 3,000 tons rather than miniature
submarines. **[Similarly, recent efforts to buy new fighter aircraft
such as F-16Vs also casts doubt as to what plans Taiwan has for the
future of its air fleet.]{.underline}**

## Nationalism/Legitimacy

### Internals: Nationalism = CCP Collapse

#### Nationalist pressure is the most likely scenario for CCP collapse. 

**Cookson 15**

(John Richard Cookson, Assistant Managing Editor of The National
Interest, 2015 "The Real Threat of Chinese Nationalism," *The National
Interest*, August 28^th^, Available Online at
<http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/the-real-threat-chinese-nationalism-13729?page=show>)

All of this comes on the eve of a state visit by Chinese president Xi
Jinping to the United States in September. Xi lands in Washington as the
leader who has, according to President Obama, "consolidated power faster
and more comprehensively than probably anybody since Deng Xiaoping.\"
**[No force has been more important in Xi's power grab than nationalism.
He has presided over a country that has stoked patriotic fervor as well
as antagonized its neighbors and the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. **[The most immediate result of stirring up
national sentiment has been to strengthen Xi's power within
the]{.underline}** seven-member **[P]{.underline}**olitburo
**[S]{.underline}**tanding **[C]{.underline}**ommittee. With this
backstop of popular support, Xi has steadfastly pursued a set of
programs, even amid some opposition. For example, his anticorruption
purge has continued even after an authority as prominent as former
president Jiang Zemin warned against it becoming too ambitious.
**[Nationalism has worked for Xi. So far]{.underline}**, patriotic,
**[mass support has protected him from a strong]{.underline}**, public
**[challenge by the military or the party. But nationalism in China has
an uncertain and]{.underline}** at times **[combustible relationship
with the]{.underline}** Chinese Communist Party (**[CCP]{.underline}**)
**[and its leaders]{.underline}** in Beijing. In China, **[street-level,
unchecked nationalism]{.underline}**---nationalism en masse---**[is a
precarious threat both to the CCP and to regional and global stability
overall]{.underline}**. In 2012, Xi took control of a China unthinkable
without Deng Xiaoping. By opening up its economy and jettisoning Mao-era
programs, China created an average of 10 percent growth per year over
the thirty years beginning with 1980. Millions were brought from
subsistence living to a point where median income now approaches a
"middle-income trap." As if to acknowledge this change, Xi reiterated
his commitment to Deng's "socialism with Chinese characteristics"
shortly after coming to power. But this phrase, "socialism with Chinese
characteristics," is by now, of course, "nonsense," China scholar
Roderick MacFarquhar said at the time. Communism no longer connects the
nation; it is no longer a unifying ideology. Instead, China now has \"No
ideology. No sense of what the country is about. And the only way, and
it is a very dangerous way, that they can achieve some kind of unity
between party, state and people, is the dangerous route of
nationalism.\" Over the last two-and-a-half decades, and with the strict
tenets of communism shed as a unifying ideology, nationalism has been
paired with robust economic growth in China to legitimize the country's
leadership. Both contributed to an "authoritarian resilience," as China
scholar Jessica Chen Weiss describes it. Now, **[nationalism and
economics have begun to decouple as growth has slowed]{.underline}** and
stocks have tumbled. **[Comparisons with Deng have turned from
complimentary of Xi to concerning for China as a whole]{.underline}**.
"**[The country is now going through a crisis of
transition]{.underline}**, **[unparalleled since Deng]{.underline}**
Xiaoping set out to put clear water between China's future and the Mao
era," **[writes]{.underline}** George **[Magnus, an associate at Oxford
University's China Centre]{.underline}** and senior advisor to UBS, in
the Financial Times. What connects the faltering economy with the
animosity between China and Japan is that antiforeign protests are some
of the only forms of mass, organized protest that have been permitted to
take place in China. As Weiss points out, while anti-Japanese
demonstrations were repressed in the 1990s and 2000s, they nonetheless
flared up in 1985, 2005, 2010 and 2012. Moreover, she notes, the 1985
anti-Japanese protests were early precursors of the pro-democracy
protests of 1986 and 1989, giving participants much needed experience in
mass mobilization. Weiss explains what **[the CCP knows
well]{.underline}**, **[that "\[e\]ven strong authoritarian governments
may have difficulty reining in protests that are widely seen as
patriotic and legitimate.\"]{.underline}** History shows that Chinese
officials quickly repress demonstrations about domestic issues. This is
less the case with antiforeign protests, which not only can have an
intrinsic, patriotic legitimacy leaders find difficult to counter, but
also, as Weiss argues, can have a value for China's leaders to signal
resolve in diplomacy. In a statement released for the anniversary of the
end of World War II on August 15, Japanese prime minister Abe said that
his "heart is rent with the utmost grief" about the damage done by his
country. But he also emphasized that "\[w\]e must not let our children,
grandchildren, and even further generations to come, who have nothing to
do with that war, be predestined to apologize." This statement joins a
list of recent perceived slights, including a row this summer over the
treatment of the war in Japanese textbooks, that irk many Chinese.
Chinese-Japanese tensions have eased somewhat since the worst days of
2012, which Weiss says saw the largest anti-Japanese demonstrations
since relations were normalized in 1972. Of the 287 prefecture cities
Weiss and a colleague studied in 2012, nearly three-quarters saw street
protests. Should Xi tolerate another spate of anti-Japanese protests, he
would be using popular sentiment to signal to Japanese officials that
China's avenues for compromise are few. Importantly, this wish to signal
resolve in diplomacy is weighed against the threat that such protests
will spiral out of control, turning to domestic grievances and turning
against Beijing. In this way, any anti-Japanese protests ostensibly
about the Second World War are a potential rallying point for discontent
about the present. "In current American usage," the scholar Bernard
Lewis noted, "the phrase 'that's history' is commonly used to dismiss
something as unimportant, of no relevance to current concerns." Not so
in much of the world, and not so in China now. **[China's
leaders]{.underline}**, Xi chief among them, **[can wield nationalism
for their own ends]{.underline}**. And now, leaders may wish to double
down on nationalism as both the economy and the legitimacy the
government has gained in the post-Deng era from a strong economy weaken.
**[But nationalism isn't an easy tool to control]{.underline}**. As
Weiss points out, \"**[the past two Chinese governments fell to
nationalist movements that accused them of failing to defend the country
from foreign encroachments]{.underline}**: the Nationalists under Chiang
Kai-shek and the Manchu leaders of the Qing dynasty.\"

### Impacts: CCP Collapse Bad

#### The impact is an unprecedented global disaster --- multiple scenarios for conflict and escalation

Political Science and Vice Dean for Centers and Programs at the Johns
Hopkins University, 2008"China: Collapse of a Great Power," Catastrophic
Consequences: Civil Wars and American Interests, pg online)

While some American policymakers would greet the prospect of a China
mired in internal conflict with relief, ~~a crippled~~ \[**[an
undermined]{.underline}**\] **[China presents]{.underline}** its own
**[threats to American interests]{.underline}**, threats **[that
are]{.underline}** in many ways **[more dire than those posed by a
rising China. American and Chinese economies have become closely
intertwined]{.underline}** with huge amounts of American investment in
China and even larger Chinese purchases of American bonds. **[If
domestic unrest undermines this relationship, any hope of China becoming
prosperous would be dashed, while the American economy would be thrown
into recession---or worse. China is a great power with a population of
1.3 billion]{.underline}** people, **[bordering]{.underline}** on **[14
countries. Its collapse would threaten the stability of
close]{.underline}** American **[allies such as South Korea and Japan,
create opportunities for mischief by Russia and North Korea, and produce
a humanitarian catastrophe unprecedented in world history. Should China
choose to stave off internal unrest through aggressive actions against
Taiwan, prospects for a Sino-American military confrontation become all
too real. Precisely]{.underline}** \[end page 116\] **[because China
needs good relations with its neighbors and the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[to continue on its path of economic growth,
there is reason to hope that the Chinese leadership would not
deliberately opt for bellicose policies. If China is wracked with
instability, however, Chinese leaders may not be able to control what
happens within and outside their borders, endangering key American
concerns]{.underline}**. Understanding the consequences of a failing
China for the United States requires first grasping why a stable China
is so important to American concerns. As will be seen, **[China plays a
central role in American economic and strategic
interests]{.underline}**. Why China, despite its seeming prosperity and
progress, may fall victim to civil unrest is then examined. Unlike
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico, **[China forces us to confront what
the collapse of a great power would be like]{.underline}**. Far from a
welcome occurrence, **[the implications of such an event are potentially
catastrophic for America, China's Asian neighbors, and the world
community]{.underline}**. American Interests in China **[The
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[cares about what
happens in China, because America's prosperity and well-being rests on
China remaining stable. China is the second largest trading partner of
the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates (after Canada), **[a
relationship whose disruption would be disastrous for both
countries]{.underline}**. The low cost of Chinese exports has kept
inflation down in the United States, while delighting consumers with
\$40 DVD players and \$20 digital cameras. **[These
benefits]{.underline}**, while highly visible, **[pale in comparison to
the critical role played by Chinese purchases of American
securities]{.underline}**. China holds over one trillion dollars in
foreign reserves, one of the largest holders of such reserves in the
world. Because China exports so much and imports so little, it
accumulates huge amounts of dollars. This would normally cause the
Chinese currency (yuan) to gain in value, thus reducing its exports and
its mammoth reserves. To preserve its critical export sector, however,
China has not allowed the yuan to float freely and instead has kept its
value relatively constant by buying dollars to the tune of \$20 billion
per month, ensuring that its reserves will continue to grow.
Approximately 70% of these reserves are in U.S. dollars, with the great
majority in U.S. treasury bonds, widely seen as the most secure
investment one can make, since they are backed in full by the American
government. **[A major reason why interest rates in the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[have been kept low is
because China buys so many of these bonds. These low interest rates are
central to the health of the American economy, fostering economic
expansion and high home prices]{.underline}**. The housing market is
especially critical, as it has been the major engine of growth for the
American economy over the past several years, as \[end page 117\]
homeowners (many of whom have saved little) borrow against the ever
rising values of their houses, stimulating the economy with their robust
consumer spending. **[If China stops buying American treasury bonds or
dramatically slows down their purchase, American interest rates would
need to increase in order to attract other buyers, making business
expansion more costly, houses much more expensive, and dramatically
cutting consumer spending]{.underline}**.3 China displayed its economic
clout the day after the Democrats won control over both houses of
Congress in November 2006, when the head of China's central bank
declared that the Bank would diversify more of its reserves into
nondollar currencies. This prompted an immediate worldwide sell-off of
American dollars, which dramatically cut the dollar's value. If such a
seemingly benign announcement could produce this effect, **[one shudders
to think of the impact of a major Chinese sell-off of American bonds on
the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates.4 **[Some have taken
solace in the view that Chinese self-interest would prevent Beijing from
acting in ways that would harm the American economy]{.underline}**. If,
for example, China halted its purchase of American securities, China too
would suffer as the value of the bonds in its possession would also
decrease. **[If China is convulsed with domestic disorder, however, it
would be unable to purchase the American bonds, plunging the U.S.
economy into crisis]{.underline}**. **[An unstable China]{.underline}**
also **[presents major strategic concerns for the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. Since the death of Mao in 1976, China has
largely cooperated with the United States on key foreign policy goals.
China has been a prime player in talks with North Korea, striving to
contain the damage done by Pyongyang's development of nuclear weapons.
In part because of China's concerns about its own Islamic minority,
Beijing has worked with Washington after 9/11 to confront terrorism.
China has become a major international player in the United Nations,
contributing more troops to peacekeeping missions around the world than
any other Security Council member.5 With Washington's endorsement, China
joined the World Trade Organization, where it is expected to play a
major role in lowering tariffs and establishing rules for free trade
that the world (and it) will follow. To be sure, the United States and
China do not agree on everything. The United States is concerned about
China's lack of democracy, overlooking of human rights abuses in Darfur
and elsewhere, border disputes with its neighbors, close ties with Iran,
and continuing claims to Taiwan. Nevertheless, **[in a world
increasingly divided between those fostering terror and instability and
those seeking to maintain order and enhance prosperity, China clearly
belongs in the latter camp, much to America's relief. If China is beset
by internal disorder, however, there is no telling what kind of regime
might emerge in its wake. The brutal civil]{.underline}** \[end page
118\] **[war in China in the late]{.underline}** 19**[40s gave birth to
an equally brutal government that made life miserable for its neighbors
and America for decades. A twenty-first-century civil war could well
bring about the emergence of a hostile, expansionist China that, armed
with nuclear weapons and a strong economy, posed an even greater threat
to American interests and world stability than its Maoist
predecessor]{.underline}**. **[A strong China is necessary to preserve
Asian stability, a vital interest of the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. **[The prosperity of Asian nations is directly
linked to the surging Chinese economy]{.underline}**. In the 1990s,
Asian nations produced goods largely for non-Asian countries,
particularly the United States. By 2005, more than half of all regional
exports were to other states in the region, with China the most likely
destination. **[China is the number one trading partner of such Asian
powerhouses as South Korea and Japan]{.underline}**, both of which now
provide more direct investment to China (over \$5 billion per year) than
even the United States.6 Moreover, **[China has emerged as the major
player in Asian multilateral organizations, including]{.underline}** the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (**[ASEAN]{.underline}**),
**[the]{.underline}** Shanghai Cooperation Organization
(**[SCO]{.underline}**), **[and]{.underline}** the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum (**[APEC]{.underline}**). **[None of these
organizations could meet their goals of fostering economic and political
interdependence without the active cooperation of China. Insofar as
economic interdependence and international institutions promote peace
and security, the continued economic growth and stability of China is
essential for Asia]{.underline}**.7 **[The importance of a stable
China]{.underline}** to American strategic interests **[is best seen by
considering what might happen if China unraveled. One of the first
consequences would be millions of refugees pouring from China's borders,
unsettling its neighbors. The stability of key American allies such as
Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan would be severely tested as they try to
cope with this massive human flow along with the economic shockwaves of
China's dissolution]{.underline}**. Nor would the United States be
immune, as many Chinese may take advantage of corrupt officials or
professional human smugglers ("snakeheads") to make their way to
America's shores.8 **[North Korea]{.underline}**, unpredictable under
normal circumstances, **[may flex its military muscle along its borders
with China and South Korea, with dreadful results. Ethnic
minorities]{.underline}** in provinces such as Tibet and Xinjiang
**[might seize the moment to attempt to break away from Beijing's
domination, fostering even greater instability. China's control of its
more than 200 nuclear weapons]{.underline}**, usually very secure,
**[may be compromised, with the arms eventually falling into unknown
hands. The territorial disputes that China has with Russia, Vietnam,
India, and others could well degenerate into armed warfare as China
loses control over its own military forces and its neighbors seek to
take advantage of its internal strife]{.underline}**. \[end page 119\]
As Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping remarked (following the 1989 Tiananmen
demonstrations), the collapse of Chinese rule would have terrible
effects that would go far beyond China's borders: "And if a civil war
broke out, with blood flowing like a river, what 'human rights' would
there be? If civil war broke out in China, with each faction dominating
a region, production declining, transportation disrupted and not
millions or tens of millions but hundreds of millions of refugees
fleeing the country, it is the Asia-Pacific region, which is at present
the most promising in the world, that would be the first affected. And
that would lead to disaster on a world scale."9 While Deng may have had
reason to exaggerate the effects of the toppling of the Chinese regime,
his concerns ring true. **[American relations with China would be
severely damaged in the wake of Chinese unrest. The Chinese regime might
single out the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[as an
enemy in order to stifle civil strife by fostering anti-American
nationalism]{.underline}**. If China violently suppressed protests, as
it did during the 1989 Tiananmen demonstrations, the American Congress
might retaliate with economic sanctions, further escalating tensions
between China and the United States. Especially if China takes actions
against groups favored by the United States, such as Chinese Christians,
the American leadership is likely to react harshly against Beijing.
Chinese leaders already worry about the United States exploiting
internal unrest to remove them from power. Actual American support of
insurgent groups even if it is confined to expressions of sympathy,
could be taken as a sign that Washington had joined with the rebels,
throwing Sino-American relations into crisis. **[China would very
quickly turn from an erstwhile ally into a superpower
adversary]{.underline}**.10 **[The deterioration]{.underline}** of the
American relationship with China **[would be especially dangerous
regarding Taiwan. Under the best of circumstances, Taiwan presents a
flash point in the]{.underline}** Chinese-American
**[relationship]{.underline}**. China's claims that Taiwan is a renegade
province belonging to the People's Republic fly in the face of America's
commitment to protect Taiwan, a democratic and prosperous ally. **[So
long as Taiwan does not declare its independence, the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and China can agree to
disagree about Taiwan's future, but should internal unrest engulf China,
this uneasy and informal accommodation could unravel. If China falls
victim to widespread instability, the pressure to act against Taiwan
would be enormous. It would give China the excuse to impose martial law,
improving its abilities to suppress any budding revolt. China's claims
to Taiwan enjoy near unanimous approval among the Chinese people. Acting
against Taiwan would enable the Chinese leadership to fan the flames of
nationalism, one of the few means at its disposal to rally support for
an otherwise illegitimate regime]{.underline}**.11 \[end page 120\] **[A
Sino-Taiwanese confrontation could also come about inadvertently if the
Chinese leadership decided to provoke a crisis over Taiwan only to find
itself at war as popular emotions prevented a peaceful resolution of the
crisis. If a Taiwanese leader decided to exploit Chinese unrest by
declaring independence, the Chinese government might have no choice but
to launch an attack]{.underline}**. As the political scientist Susan
Shirk argues, **[no Chinese regime can stand aside and allow Taiwan to
announce its independence without going to war if it expects to survive
in power]{.underline}**.12 **[Whether through miscalculation or
brinksmanship, war with Taiwan producing a Sino-American confrontation
could well be the unintended outcome of Chinese civil
conflict]{.underline}**. China is well prepared to take forceful action
against Taiwan if it decides to do so. China has been constantly
upgrading its air and sea capabilities for a possible invasion across
the Straits of Taiwan.13 If China chooses not to invade, it could launch
the hundreds of ballistic missiles deployed on its coast against Taiwan
or it could blockade its two principal ports. Given that Taiwan is
critically dependent on foreign trade (75% of its GDP) and imports of
fuel for energy consumption (95% of its energy needs come from outside
the country), either of these actions would cripple the island state.14
It is difficult to see the United States remaining indifferent to a
brutal assault against one of its allies. Perhaps most worrisome, **[we
simply do not know all of the effects that the collapse of China would
bring]{.underline}**. The prospect of civil unrest in China threatens an
existing great power poised perhaps to become the major power of the
twenty-first century. **[The impact of civil conflict in China cannot be
isolated to]{.underline}** one or **[a handful of consequences. As seen
in the French Revolution]{.underline}** of 1789--1799 **[and the Russian
Civil War]{.underline}** of 1918--1920, **[great powers do not suffer
civil violence quietly, or alone. Given China's central role in the
world economy, enormous population, nuclear arsenal, and growing
international influence, the unraveling of China cannot help but be
shattering for the world]{.underline}**. Change can be beneficial, and
the weakening of a prospective superpower competitor would be celebrated
in some American quarters. Nevertheless, **[an uncontrolled, cataclysmic
transformation in China would threaten American interests as much as, if
not more than, the purposeful designs of Maoist China a generation
ago]{.underline}**.

where, **[Beijing could manufacture external crises with opponents
against whom nationalist fervor, a major characteristic of contemporary
China, can be channeled.]{.underline}** **[In past
decades]{.underline}**, **[the CCP has on several occasions tapped into
public outrage to distract a disgruntled population, often by
encouraging (and when necessary containing) protests against external
opponents, namely Japan and the United States]{.underline}**. While
serving as a convenient outlet, domestic protests, even when they turned
violent (e.g., attacks on Japanese manufacturers), were about as far as
the CCP would allow. This self-imposed restraint, which was prevalent
during the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, was a function both of China's focus
on building its economy (contingent on stable relations with its
neighbors) and perceived military weakness. Since then, **[China has
established itself as the world's second-largest economy and now
deploys, thanks to more than a decade of double-digit defense budget
growth, a first-rate modern military. Those impressive achievements
have, however, fueled Chinese nationalism, which has increasingly
approached the dangerous zone of hubris.]{.underline}** For many, China
is now a rightful regional hegemon demanding respect, which if denied
can --- and should --- be met with threats, if not the application of
force. While it might be tempting to attribute China's recent
assertiveness in the South and East China Seas to the emergence of Xi
Jinping, Xi alone cannot make all the decisions; **[nationalism is a
component that cannot be dissociated from this new phase in Chinese
expressions of its power]{.underline}**. As then-Chinese foreign
minister Yang Jiechi is said to have told his counterparts at a tense
regional forum in Hanoi in 2010, "There is one basic difference among
us. China is a big state and you are smaller countries." This newfound
assertiveness within its backyard thus makes it more feasible that, in
times of serious trouble at home, **[the Chinese leadership could seek
to deflect potentially destabilizing anger by exploiting some external
distraction.]{.underline}** Doing so is always a calculated risk, and
sometimes the gambit fails, as Slobodan Milosevic learned the hard way
when he tapped into the furies of nationalism to appease mounting public
discontent with his bungled economic policies. For an external
distraction to achieve its objective (that is, taking attention away
from domestic issues by redirecting anger at an outside actor), it must
not result in failure or military defeat. In other words, except for the
most extreme circumstances, such as the imminent collapse of a regime,
the decision to externalize a domestic crisis is a rational one:
adventurism must be certain to achieve success, which in turn will
translate into political gains for the embattled regime. Risk-taking is
therefore proportional to the seriousness of the destabilizing forces
within. Rule No. 1 for External Distractions: **[The greater the
domestic instability, the more risks a regime will be willing to take,
given that the scope and, above all, the symbolism of the victory in an
external scenario must also be greater]{.underline}**. With this in
mind, we can then ask which external distraction scenarios would Beijing
be the most likely to turn to should domestic disturbances compel it to
do so. That is not to say that anything like this will happen anytime
soon. **[It is nevertheless not unreasonable to imagine such a
possibility. The intensifying crackdown on critics of the CCP, the
detention]{.underline}** of lawyers, journalists and activists,
**[unrest in Xinjiang, random acts of terrorism, accrued censorship ---
all point to growing instability. What follows is a very succinct (and
by no means exhaustive) list of disputes]{.underline}**, in descending
order of likelihood, which Beijing could use for external distraction.
**[1. South China Sea]{.underline}** The South China Sea, an area where
China is embroiled in several territorial disputes with smaller
claimants, **[is ripe for exploitation as an external
distraction]{.underline}**. Nationalist sentiment, along with the sense
that **[the entire body of water is part of China's indivisible
territory and therefore a "core interest," are sufficient enough to
foster a will to fight should some "incident," timed to counter unrest
back home, force China to react]{.underline}**. Barring a U.S.
intervention, which for the time being seems unlikely, the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) has both the numerical and qualitative advantage
against any would be opponent or combination thereof. **[The Philippines
and Vietnam, two countries which have skirmished with China in recent
years, are the likeliest candidates for external distractions,
as]{.underline}** the **[costs]{.underline}** of a brief conflict
**[would be low]{.underline}** and the likelihood of military success
fairly high. For a quick popularity boost and low-risk distraction,
these opponents would best serve Beijing's interests. **[2. Jammu and
Kashmir, Arunachal Pradesh Although Beijing claims that it is ready for
a settlement of its longstanding territorial disputes with
India,]{.underline}** the **[areas remain ripe]{.underline}** for the
re-ignition of conflict. **[New Delhi accuses China of occupying 38,000
square kilometers in Jammu and Kashmir, and Beijing lays claim to more
than 90,000 square kilometers of territory inside the Indian state of
Arunachal Pradesh]{.underline}**. A few factors militate against the
suitability of those territories for an external distraction, chief
among them the difficult access in winter, and the strength of the
Indian military, which would pose a greater risk to PLA troops than
those of Vietnam or the Philippines in the previous scenario.
Nevertheless, **[memories of China's routing of the Indian military in
the Sino-Indian War of 1962 could embolden Beijing.]{.underline}**
Though challenging, the PLA would be expected to prevail in a limited
conflict with Indian forces, and China would have taken on a greater
regional power than Vietnam or the Philippines, with everything that
this entails in terms of political benefits back home. **[3. East China
Sea and Japan Sparking a war with Japan, presumably over the disputed
Senkaku/Diaoyu islets, would represent a major escalation on Beijing's
part]{.underline}**. **[Assuming that rational actors are in control in
Beijing, a decision to begin hostilities]{.underline}** with the modern
and skilled Japan Self-Defense Forces **[would only be made if domestic
instability were serious enough]{.underline}**. **[Still]{.underline}**,
**[high resentment]{.underline}** of the Japanese stemming **[from
Japanese aggression]{.underline}** before and during World War II **[and
the competitive nature of the bilateral relationship]{.underline}**
**[make Japan]{.underline}** the **[perfect]{.underline}** candidate for
an external distraction. More than any other conflict, **[hostilities
with Japan would rally ordinary Chinese to the flag and tap into hatred
that the leadership knows it could exploit if necessary.]{.underline}**
**[Although the chances of prevailing would be much
smaller]{.underline}** than in the South China Sea or Indian scenarios
(**[especially if the U.S. became involved]{.underline}**), the
**[dividends]{.underline}** of victory against Japan --- anything from
teaching Tokyo a lesson to redressing historical injustices --- **[could
be]{.underline}** such as to become a major factor in **[appeasing major
domestic unrest in China]{.underline}**. Unless the CCP were on the
brink of collapse, it is unlikely that the leadership in Beijing would
escalate tensions with Japan beyond the disputed islets. In other words,
military action probably would not extend to other parts of Japan's
territory, unless, of course, the conflict widened. Containing the
conflict by limiting it to the Senkaku/Diaoyus would therefore be part
of Beijing's strategy. **[4. Taiwan The "reunification" of Taiwan
remains a so-called "core interest" of China and a major component of
the CCP's legitimacy with the public.]{.underline}** Despite
rapprochement in recent years, a substantial component of the PLA
remains committed to a Taiwan contingency. **[Although the risks of war
in the Taiwan Strait are low at the moment, China never shelved its
plans to annex the island by force if necessary, and has vowed to do so
should Taipei seek to unilaterally change the status quo by declaring de
jure independence.]{.underline}** Under Xi, **[Beijing]{.underline}**
has also signaled that while it is willing to be patient with Taiwanese
and would prefer to use financial incentives to gradually consolidate
its grip on Taiwan, it **[does not intend to be patient
forever.]{.underline}** In other words, foot-dragging on Taiwan's part,
or the election of a political party that is less amenable to
rapprochement than the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), could prompt Beijing to
choose a more aggressive course of action. **[Serious unrest on the
island could also provide Beijing with the "justification" it needs to
involve the PLA, which would be deployed to "protect" Taiwanese
"compatriots."]{.underline}** Given that definitions of progress on
"**[reunification" are very much Beijing's to decide, any incident could
theoretically warrant the use of force against Taiwan]{.underline}**,
**[especially if major domestic unrest compelled the CCP to seek an
external distraction]{.underline}**. Militating against such a decision
is the fact that anything short of a full invasion of the island would
probably forever kill any chance of "peaceful unification" with Taiwan,
as the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait missile crisis demonstrated. **[A limited
military campaign against Taiwan is therefore probably not a good option
for an external distraction, as the backlash against aggression would
undo years of calibrated Taiwan policy and destroy hopes of unification,
which would greatly discredit the CCP with the Chinese public, not to
mention the PLA. A full invasion of Taiwan would then provide greater
chances of success]{.underline}**, at least **[if we measure success by
its impact on public opinion amid serious unrest]{.underline}** in
China. **[However, the growing power imbalance in the Taiwan Strait
notwithstanding, invading the island would be an extraordinarily
difficult --- and costly --- task; talk of a "quick, clear war" remains
just that, and pacifying the island would be a formidable
challenge.]{.underline}** Should the conflict drag on, as it most
certainly would, whatever advantage the CCP may have accumulated by
tapping into nationalist sentiment could dwindle and further contribute
to resentment against the party. **[Consequently, unless the CCP were on
the brink of collapse, Taiwan would be an extremely poor candidate for
external distraction, worse even than Japan, where the chances of
success in a limited campaign are higher. 5. United
States]{.underline}** The last, and least likely, candidate for external
distraction would be for the PLA to turn its sights on U.S. forces in
the Pacific. For obvious reasons, **[such a course of action would be a
last resort, a last-ditch effort to prevent the complete collapse of the
CCP due to domestic factors.]{.underline}** The chances of prevailing in
a direct military confrontation with U.S. forces in the region would be
next to nil. **[A decision to attack the U.S. would qualify as
irrational, a departure from the realm of calculations that would
buttress decisions in any of the alternative scenarios discussed
above]{.underline}**. Still there are examples of countries that
embarked on what, in hindsight, can only be described as suicidal
adventures by attacking a much more powerful enemy. **[Japan
demonstrated that this is possible during World War II. A likelier
source of conflict between the PLA and U.S. forces would be indirect,
such as U.S. involvement in limited hostilities between China and any of
the countries mentioned above (with Japan and Taiwan as the
likeliest).]{.underline}** As the PLA is configured not to take on the
U.S. military directly but rather asymmetrically, **[China would
increase its chances of scoring domestic points by playing to its
strengths --- by inflicting damage on U.S. forces with its
anti-access/area-denial, or A2/AD. Sinking an aircraft carrier on its
way to the East China Sea or towards the Taiwan Strait, for example,
could do wonders in terms of public opinion and provide temporary cover
for an embattled CCP.]{.underline}** Ultimately, however, the costs of
taking on the U.S. military, added to the extremely low likelihood that
Chinese troops could secure the kind of victory that would be necessary
to rescue the CCP from internal strife, mean that the U.S. is an
especially bad candidate for external distraction.

Economics is just part of the story of peak China. **[Years of promoting
the idea that China would develop into a pillar of international order
has run aground on the rocks of national interest and territorial
disputes]{.underline}** in the seas around China. While far from the
only nation to assert territorial claims through land reclamation in the

shocking]{.underline}**. **[The P]{.underline}**eople's
**[L]{.underline}**iberation **[A]{.underline}**rmy **[is creating new
military bases in the contested Spratly Islands for power projection and
further intimidation]{.underline}** of its smaller neighbors. Beijing's
stated intention to defend the "sovereignty" of its 12-mile maritime
territorial limits around newly built islands poses a threat to free
navigation. An Asian ambassador in Washington asserts that **[China is
attempting to present the Obama administration with a new status quo in
Asia]{.underline}**. Even President Obama, who just concluded another
annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue with top Chinese officials, has
called **[Beijing's actions in the South China Sea
"aggressive]{.underline}**." Far from being seen as a factor
contributing to stability in Asia, **[a more assertive and confident
China is]{.underline}** perceived as **[a]{.underline}**
**[destabilizing element]{.underline}**. As in the economic realm,
decades of the world encouraging a larger Chinese role both regionally
and globally has resulted in Beijing feeling emboldened to define its
interests in opposition to the rules-based political order that promotes
free exchange. Even if **[China]{.underline}** claims that it is simply
protecting its national interests in the South China Sea, and
**[is]{.underline}** thus not a threat to those around it, no such
assertion can be made about its **[predatory cyberattacks on some of its
biggest trading partners]{.underline}**. The Japanese government has
stated that it suffered approximately 10 billion cyberattacks from
Chinese sources in 2014, 40% of the national total. Meanwhile, **[the

files of U.S. government workers were breached by Chinese
hackers]{.underline}**. U.S. Congressional sources put the figure at
upwards of 30 million, including those Americans holding security
clearances. It is increasingly hard to claim that China is a partner
when it is writing a new history of cyberaggression. **[Behind all these
dangers lies one common factor]{.underline}**: **[an unreconstructed
Communist Party determined to hold on to absolute power]{.underline}**.
Unable to stop the stock slide, and **[facing growing

**[adventurism abroad to deflect attention away from

#### Cyber attack is the [highest probability]{.underline} scenario for nuclear use. 

**Lawson 9** (Sean, Assistant professor in the Department of
Communication at the University of Utah, Cross-Domain Response to Cyber
Attacks and the Threat of Conflict Escalation, May 13th 2009,
http://www.seanlawson.net/?p=477)

Introduction At a time when it seems impossible to avoid the seemingly
growing hysteria over the threat of cyber war,\[1\] network security
expert Marcus Ranum delivered a refreshing talk recently, "The Problem
with Cyber War," that took a critical look at a number of the
assumptions underlying contemporary cybersecurity discourse in the
United States. He addressed one issue in partiuclar that I would like to
riff on here, the issue of conflict escalation--i.e. the possibility
that **[offensive use of cyber attacks]{.underline}** could **[escalate
to the use of physical force]{.underline}**. As I will show, his
concerns are entirely legitimate as **[current U.S. military cyber
doctrine assumes the possibility]{.underline}** of what I call
"**[cross-domain responses]{.underline}**" to cyberattacks. Backing Your
Adversary (Mentally) into a Corner Based on the premise that completely
blinding a potential adversary is a good indicator to that adversary
that an attack is iminent, Ranum has argued that "**[The best
thing]{.underline}** that **[you could]{.underline}** possibly **[do if
you want to start World War III is launch a cyber attack]{.underline}**.
\[\...\] When people talk about cyber war like it's a practical thing,
what they're really doing is messing with the OK button for starting
World War III. We need to get them to sit the f-k down and shut the f-k
up." \[2\] He is making a point similar to one that I have made in the
past: **[Taking away an adversary's ability to make rational decisions
could backfire]{.underline}**. \[3\] For example, Gregory Witol cautions
that "attacking the decision makerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to perform rational
calculations may cause more problems than it hopes to resolveÃ¢â‚¬Â¦
**[Removing the capacity for rational action may result
in]{.underline}** completely **[unforeseen consequences]{.underline}**,
including longer and bloodier battles than may otherwise have been."
\[4\] Ã¯Â»Â¿Cross-Domain Response So, from a theoretical standpoint, I
think his concerns are well founded. But the current state of U.S.
policy may be cause for even greater concern. It's not just worrisome
that a hypothetical blinding attack via cyberspace could send a signal
of imminent attack and therefore trigger an irrational response from the
adversary. What is also cause for concern is that **[current U.S. policy
indicates that]{.underline}** "**[kinetic attacks]{.underline}**" (i.e.
physical use of force) **[are seen as]{.underline}** potentially
**[legitimate responses to cyber attacks]{.underline}**. Most worrisome
is that current **[U.S. policy implies that a nuclear
response]{.underline}** is possible, something that policy makers have
not denied in recent press reports. The reason, in part, is that the
U.S. defense community has increasingly come to see cyberspace as a
"domain of warfare" equivalent to air, land, sea, and space. The
definition of cyberspace as its own domain of warfare helps in its own
right to blur the online/offline, physical-space/cyberspace boundary.
But thinking logically about the potential consequences of this framing
leads to some disconcerting conclusions. If cyberspace is a domain of
warfare, then it becomes possible to define "cyber attacks" (whatever
those may be said to entail) as acts of war. But what happens if the
U.S. is attacked in any of the other domains? It retaliates. But it
usually does not respond only within the domain in which it was
attacked. Rather, responses are typically "cross-domain responses"--i.e.
a massive bombing on U.S. soil or vital U.S. interests abroad (e.g.
think 9/11 or Pearl Harbor) might lead to air strikes against the
attacker. Even more likely given a U.S. military "way of warfare" that
emphasizes multidimensional, "joint" operations is a massive
conventional (i.e. non-nuclear) response against the attacker in all
domains (air, land, sea, space), simultaneously. The possibility of
"kinetic action" in response to cyber attack, or as part of offensive
U.S. cyber operations, is part of the current (2006) National Military
Strategy for Cyberspace Operations \[5\]: Of course, the possibility
that a cyber attack on the U.S. could lead to a U.S. nuclear reply
constitutes possibly the ultimate in "cross-domain response." And while
this may seem far fetched, it has not been ruled out by U.S. defense
policy makers and is, in fact, implied **[in current U.S. defense policy
documents]{.underline}**. From the National Military Strategy of the
United States (2004): "The term WMD/E relates to a broad range of
adversary capabilities that pose potentially devastating impacts. WMD/E
includes chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and enhanced high
explosive weapons as well as other, more asymmetrical 'weapons'. They
may rely more on disruptive impact than destructive kinetic effects. For
example, cyber attacks on US commercial information systems or attacks
against transportation networks may have a greater economic or
psychological effect than a relatively small release of a lethal agent."
\[6\] The authors of a 2009 National Academies of Science report on
cyberwarfare respond to this by saying, "Coupled with the declaratory
policy on nuclear weapons described earlier, this statement implies that
**[the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[will regard
certain kinds of cyberattacks]{.underline}**against the United States
**[as being in the same category as nuclear]{.underline}**,
**[biological]{.underline}**, **[and chemical weapons]{.underline}**,
**[and thus that a nuclear response to certain kinds of
cyberattacks]{.underline}** (namely, cyberattacks with devastating
impacts) **[may be possible]{.underline}**. It also sets a relevant
scale--a cyberattack that has an impact larger than that associated with
a relatively small release of a lethal agent is regarded with the same
or greater seriousness." \[7\] Asked by the New York Times to comment on
this, U.S. defense officials would not deny that nuclear retaliation
remains an option for response to a massive cyberattack: "Pentagon and
military officials confirmed that the United States reserved the option
to respond in any way it chooses to punish an adversary responsible for
a catastrophic cyberattack. While the options could include the use of
nuclear weapons, officials said, such an extreme counterattack was
hardly the most likely response." \[8\] The rationale for this policy:
"Thus, the United States never declared that it would be bound to
respond to a Soviet and Warsaw Pact conventional invasion with only
American and NATO conventional forces. The fear of escalating to a
nuclear conflict was viewed as a pillar of stability and is credited
with helping deter the larger Soviet-led conventional force throughout
the cold war. Introducing the possibility of a nuclear response to a
catastrophic cyberattack would be expected to serve the same purpose."
\[9\] Non-unique, Dangerous, and In-credible? There are a couple of
interesting things to note in response. First is the development of a
new acronym, WMD/E (weapons of mass destruction or effect). Again, this
acronym indicates a weakening of the requirement of physical impacts. In
this new definition, mass effects that are not necessarily physical, nor
necessarily destructive, but possibly only disruptive economically or
even psychologically (think "shock and awe") are seen as equivalent to
WMD. This new emphasis on effects, disruption, and psychology reflects
both contemporary, but also long-held beliefs within the U.S. defense
community. It reflects current thinking in U.S. military theory, in
which it is said that U.S. forces should be able to "mass fires" and
"mass effects" without having to physically "mass forces." There is a
sliding scale in which the physical (often referred to as the "kinetic")
gradually retreats--i.e. massed forces are most physical; massed fire is
less physical (for the U.S. anyway); and massed effects are the least
physical, having as the ultimate goal Sun Tzu's "pinnacle of
excellence," winning without fighting. But the emphasis on disruption
and psychology in WMD/E has also been a key component of much of 20th
century military thought in the West. Industrial theories of warfare in
the early 20th century posited that industrial societies were
increasingly interdependent and reliant upon mass production,
transportation, and consumption of material goods. Both industrial
societies and the material links that held them together, as well as
industrial people and their own internal linkages (i.e. nerves), were
seen as increasingly fragile and prone to disruption via attack with the
latest industrial weapons: airplanes and tanks. Once interdependent and
fragile industrial societies were hopelessly disrupted via attack by the
very weapons they themselves created, the nerves of modern, industrial
men and women would be shattered, leading to moral and mental defeat and
a loss of will to fight. Current thinking about the possible dangers of
cyber attack upon the U.S. are based on the same basic premises:
technologically dependent and therefore fragile societies populated by
masses of people sensitive to any disruption in expected standards of
living are easy targets. Ultimately, however, a number of researchers
have pointed out the pseudo-psychological, pseudo-sociological, and
a-historical (not to mention non-unique) nature of these assumptions.
\[10\] Others have pointed out that these assumptions did not turn out
to be true during WWII strategic bombing campaigns, that modern,
industrial societies and populations were far more resilient than
military theorists had assumed. \[11\] Finally, even some military
theorists have questioned the assumptions behind cyber war, especially
when assumptions about our own technology dependence-induced societal
fragility (dubious on their own) are applied to other societies,
especially non-Western societies (even more dubious). \[12\] Finally,
where deterrence is concerned, it is important to remember that a
deterrent has to be credible to be effective. True, the U.S. retained
nuclear weapons as a deterrent during the Cold War. But, from the 1950s
through the 1980s, there was increasing doubt among U.S. planners
regarding the credibility of U.S. nuclear deterrence via the threat of
"massive retaliation." As early as the 1950s it was becoming clear that
the U.S. would be reluctant at best to actually follow through on its
threat of massive retaliation. Unfortunately, most money during that
period had gone into building up the nuclear arsenal; conventional
weapons had been marginalized. Thus, the U.S. had built a force it was
likely never to use. So, the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s saw the development
of concepts like "flexible response" and more emphasis on building up
conventional forces. This was the big story of the 1980s and the "Reagan
build-up" (not "Star Wars"). Realizing that, after a decade of
distraction in Vietnam, it was back in a position vis-a-viz the Soviets
in Europe in which it would have to rely on nuclear weapons to offset
its own weakness in conventional forces, a position that could lead only
to blackmail or holocaust, the U.S. moved to create stronger
conventional forces. \[13\] Thus, the question where cyber war is
concerned: If it was in-credible that the U.S. would actually follow
through with massive retaliation after a Soviet attack on the U.S. or
Western Europe, is it really credible to say that the U.S. would respond
with nuclear weapons to a cyber attack, no matter how disruptive or
destructive? Beyond credibility, **[deterrence]{.underline}** makes many
other assumptions that are problematic in the cyber war context. It
**[assumes an adversary capable of being deterred]{.underline}**. Can
most of those who would perpetrate a cyber attack be deterred? **[Will
al-Qa'ida be deterred]{.underline}**? **[How about a band of
nationalistic or even just thrill-seeker]{.underline}**, **[bandwagon
hackers for hire]{.underline}**? Second, **[it assumes]{.underline}**
clear lines of command and control. Sure, some hacker groups might be
funded and assisted to a great degree by states. But ultimately, even
cyber war theorists will admit that **[it is doubtful that states have
complete control over their armies of hacker mercenaries]{.underline}**.
How will deterrence play out in this kind of scenario?

#### China is governed by [defensive realism]{.underline}

EM)

However, **[since the 1970s China's policies have shown less revisionist
tendencies. The country has increasingly become a state that is
embracing defensive realism.]{.underline}** One thread of this evidence
is that **[China has toned-down its revolutionary rhetoric. It
is]{.underline}** also **[not supporting insurgencies]{.underline}** in
other countries. The second thread of evidence is that **[since the late
1970s China has increasingly pursued a cooperative security approach in
its relations with regional neighbours and in the international arena.
By and large, China has tried to forge friendly relations]{.underline}**
with its neighbours. It **[includes ameliorating relations with states
like India]{.underline}** which is traditionally a rival. Their
relations did become strained in 2017 when there was a standoff between
the Indian and the Chinese forces on the Doklam plateau. Dhoklam is a
territory claimed both by Bhutan (aligned with India) and China.
However, Indo-China relations improved as the two **[countries held an
informal summit in China in April 2018.]{.underline}**30 **[The two
countries even held a joint military exercise]{.underline}** in December
2018, **[called Hand-in-Hand.]{.underline}**31 Over the years, China has
also managed to resolve border issues with so many neighbouring states.
It has **[settled border disputes with]{.underline}** countries like
**[Myanmar, Nepal and Pakistan]{.underline}** initially **[and recently
with Russia]{.underline}**, bordering the Central Asian States **[and
Vietnam.]{.underline}**32 **[Moreover, China has territorial disputes
with]{.underline}** India and Japan but **[it has never made these
disputes a hurdle in forging friendly ties]{.underline}** with these two
countries. **[Avery Goldstein dubs it a neo-Bismarckian grand
strategy]{.underline}** of China **[whereby it is pursuing its interests
by reassuring those who may feel threatened and may form anti-China
alliances.]{.underline}**33 This, in his opinion, **[has resulted in a
security environment that is conducive for China as well as for the
region as a whole. Another indication]{.underline}** that China does not
show aggressive behaviour in its policies **[is that China has
increasingly engaged and integrated with the international
community.]{.underline}** Over the past 30 years, China has amply
demonstrated this by its increasing membership of international
organisations and institutions as well as membership of treaties since
the 1980s. China has increasingly participated in the regional
multilateral institutions over the years. **[In the last few decades,
East Asia has seen a number of regional institutions being formed.
Foremost among those are]{.underline}** the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (**[APEC]{.underline}**); the ASEAN Regional Forum
(**[ARF]{.underline}**); ASEAN plus 3 **[and the East Asia Summit. China
is part of most of these multilateral institutions as well as an active
member of the]{.underline}** Shanghai Cooperation Organisation
(**[SCO]{.underline}**). China was also a key player in the
sixparty-talks in getting North Korea to halt and roll back its nuclear
and missile programmes. On the global front, China sought participation
in global institutions like the World Trade Organisation (WTO). **[China
is also playing a very active role in the UN.]{.underline}** According
to one figure, **[China's membership of international governmental
organisations doubled (from 21 to 52) during the years
1977-1997.]{.underline}** In the same time period, its membership of
International Non-Governmental Organisations (INGOs) increased from mere
71 to an impressive 1,163.34 Similarly, according to another account,
China signed less than 30 per cent of the arms control accords it was
eligible to join in the 1970s compared to 80 per cent by mid-1990s. 35
**[China has actively taken part in the treaties of the nuclear
non-proliferation regime as well as those of aimed at non-proliferation
of biological and chemical weapons.]{.underline}** It has also become a
part of the voluntary non-proliferation groups like the Nuclear
Suppliers Group (NSG) in 2004 and exercises strict export control
policies. Since 2004, China has also shown interest in joining the
Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). This is an indicator of
China's willingness to participate in international institutes and
regimes, increasing comfort towards norms of interdependent behaviour
among states. It has also exhibited the desire to somewhat shape the
rules of the game for regional cooperation. This is definitely an
indication of its tendency towards the status quo. It also advances
China's national interests and helps dispel concerns about its
increasing economic and military power.36 This is also an indicator that
China is willing to work in the existing Western-dominated systems of
international institution and regimes rather than challenge the system
or seek to break it up. Moreover, China consciously pursued a good
neighbour policy. The pursuit of good relations with its neighbour is
the foundation of its strategy for economic development. It has the dual
benefit of attracting foreign trade and investment while, at the same
time, it reassures its neighbours that it does not present a threat for
them. Deng Xiaoping laid two paths for China's foreign policy in 1990 ─
anti-hegemonism and establishment of a new multi-polar international
order of politics and economics. This meant that China adopted a policy
of active defence of China's interest ─ of minding its own business and
be neither a leader nor a challenger but a participant or co-builder of
the westerns international order.37 This remains the foundation of
China's foreign policy today. **[Many analysts,]{.underline}** however,
**[argue that participation in]{.underline}** the international
**[institutions is not an adequate indicator]{.underline}** but
compliance with the norms, rules and goals of these institutions is a
better indicator of whether a country is a status quo state or not.
**[Along these lines,]{.underline}** Alastair **[Johnston considers
China's compliance with]{.underline}** five **[global normative
regimes:]{.underline}** these include sovereignty, free trade,
non-proliferation and arms control, national self determination and
human rights.38 **[As far as sovereignty is concerned]{.underline}** he
writes: "Today **[China is one of the strongest defenders of a more
traditional absolutist concept]{.underline}** (of sovereignty)."39
Similarly, free trade is another international norm that is seen as an
indicator of status quo behaviour. China has moved to support the norms
of global free trade. China's **[membership of WTO]{.underline}** in
2001 **[is a testament to its support for free trade.]{.underline}**
China's **[tariff rates have declined from over 40 per cent in 1992 to
less than 20 per cent in 1997.]{.underline}**40 In 2015, the tariff rate
was 3.4 per cent.41 China has gradually embraced global capitalist
institutions and system. In the Belt and Road Forum that China held in
May 2017, hosting 30 world leaders, it released a communiqué, which was
signed by all 30 world leaders present on the occasion that emphasised
the need to "build an open economy, ensure free and inclusive trade
(and) oppose all forms of protectionism."42 However, the ongoing trade
war with the US has forced China to increase its tariffs. Since 2017,
the US had imposed three rounds of tariff on the Chinese products worth
US\$250 billion. China has retaliated by imposing US\$110 billion on the
US goods. Beijing has accused the US of starting the "largest trade war
in economic history." 43 This damages the global free trade regime.
**[China has gone even a step further and initiated projects like the
China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which is envisaged as a journey
towards economic regionalisation.]{.underline}** The CPEC is a framework
of regional connectivity which is expected to be beneficial for China
and Pakistan as well as the regional states like India, Iran,
Afghanistan and Central Asia. Its primary aim is to promote geographical
linkages and improve infrastructure connectivity. It would also result
in a higher flow of trade and businesses in the region.44 Its ultimate
aim is to have a well-connected region, promote harmony and accelerate
economic development. This is also a **[clear indication that China is
focused on economic development and regionalisation instead of
displaying aggressive hegemonic behaviour. As far as China's
non-proliferation record is concerned, it has a fair record, with no
blatant violations of international nuclear non-proliferation
norms.]{.underline}** The prevailing concerns mostly centred on the
transfer of missile technology and components to Pakistan in the 1980s
and early 1990s. However, China has not signed the 1987 MTCR, so it does
not amount to any violations of China's treaty obligations. On the
positive side, in 1996, China signed the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty
(CTBT), which a major nuclear non-proliferation proponent like the US
has not done till date.45 It has been cooperating with the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty Organisation (CTBTO) and has installed four new
International Monitoring System (IMS) stations, bringing the total
number of certified stations in China, to five. Furthermore, it is also
a part of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) since the time that
it was signed. Moreover, along with Russia, China has long been trying
to get a treaty negotiated to ban the stationing of offensive weapons in
outer-space. For nearly two decades, now there have been the Chinese and
Russian efforts to negotiate a treaty for Prevention of an Arms Race in
Outer Space (PAROS). Many proposals have been put forward including the
two Chinese working papers and a joint China-Russia working paper in the
Conference on Disarmament (CD). However, PAROS remains blocked due to
the US refusal to negotiate any such treaty because it goes against its
missile defence and space plans.46 China **[has]{.underline}** also
**[played a stabilising role in the North Korean nuclear issue. It acted
as a lynchpin in hosting and conducting the six-party talks, which were
meant to solve the North Korean nuclear issue.]{.underline}** Even after
the breakdown of the six-party talks in 2009 and the recent high
tensions on the Korean Peninsula in 2017 with the US, China played the
role of a stabiliser, urging both sides to show restraint and
emphasising that war was not an option for any country. China has, thus,
helped strengthen the international nuclear non-proliferation norms.
Also, China's growing soft power47 or its "charm offensive" in Southeast
Asia and elsewhere is another indicator that it is not an aggressive,
power maximising state. Its economic progress has been accompanied by
its increasing cultural and diplomatic influence around the globe. Its
growing soft power is not only evident in Southeast Asia but also in
Beijing's economic partnerships in Latin America and Africa.48 The fact
that China is able to attract and appeal the states in the region
through its soft power is an indicator that its neighbours are
increasingly viewing China as less of a threat. However, this has
stirred the concerns of waning the US influence in the region. In many
parts of Asia, Africa and the Latin America, the "Beijing Consensus"
which advocates a mix of authoritarian government and market economy, is
overtaking the "Washington Consensus" of market economics and democratic
government which was popular in the past.49 With signs that the US is
placing emphasis on hard power under President Donald Trump, China seems
to be positioning itself as a champion of globalisation and economic
integration. It seems to be placing an emphasis on soft power.
**[Taiwan]{.underline}** issue **[is one instance where China's policies
are viewed by the West as a non-status quo. However, the issue can be
seen in terms of a security dilemma between the US and China. In the
last few decades, America continued selling advanced weapons to Taiwan,
mainland China considers these developments to encourage Taiwan's
independence and a threat to its interests.]{.underline}** According to
Yiwei Wang, "on the Taiwan issue, **[America's logic is that peace comes
from "balance of power." China has time and again protested the matter
of arms sales to Taiwan with the US but to no avail. China sees these
moves as an effort to change the distribution of power in the region. In
turn, China has threatened Taiwan against moves for independence and
deployed missiles on the mainland as well. Consequently, this makes the
US suspicious of China's revisionist intentions towards Taiwan --
locking the two powers in a security dilemma. Another area where China
has been accused of displaying revisionist tendencies is in the South
China Sea.]{.underline}** The dispute centres on territorial claims over
two island chains the Paracels and the Spratlys and surrounding oceans.
The area provides valuable trade passage and fishing ground, as well as
holds hydrocarbon resources ranging from 25,000 Mboe to 260,000 Mboe.51
China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei all have
competing claims. The **[dispute has existed for centuries but things
got tense in the last few years.]{.underline}** China has been
island-building since 2014 and has also increased naval patrols. **[It
can be argued that China's actions are defensive in nature. The US has
had increased interference in the area. Under the garb of "freedom of
navigation" operations, the US sent planes and ships in the disputed
area to keep access to key shipping and air routes]{.underline}**.52 In
February 2017, the US deployed the aircraft carrier, Carl Vinson, strike
force to the South China Sea under the garb of "freedom of
navigation."53 Another week-long US and British Naval exercise took
place in January 2019.54 These are meant to send a signal to China to
rescind claims over the disputed area. **[These exercises have angered
China. China does not have expansionist or hegemonic designs in the
South China Sea. It claims over the two island chains are not something
new. Beijing has adjusted its strategy to safeguard its interests, as it
becomes increasingly powerful. However, a military conflict over the
dispute is not an option. Moreover, the US influence over other
claimants of the territory complicates matters for China. This has
resulted in China acting more assertively in the South China Sea in
order to defend its interests. In fact, the US would act more
aggressively if any country was to interfere in matters close to its
borders. Overall, from the above analysis, it can be summarised that
China has so far behaved more as a status quo power rather than as an
aggressive]{.underline}** revisionist **[power.]{.underline}** This is
apparent in China's engagement with its neighbours, its participation in
the regional and international institutions, it is in compliance with
most of the international norms as well as its emphasis on projecting
its soft power. The claims of Mearsheimer's offensive realism are in
contrast with Waltz's defensive realism on several points. While
Mearsheimer claims that great powers act aggressively and aim to gain so
much power that they are the ultimate hegemons in the system, Waltz's
defensive realism sees the states as acting defensively to maintain
rather than upset the balance of power. For Waltz, the **[states are
primarily concerned with maintaining "their position in the
system."]{.underline}**55 Defensive realists argue that
**[offence-defence balance favours the defence.]{.underline}** 56
**[Therefore, a robust defence and careful balancing should deter any
aggressive impulses from great powers.]{.underline}** Defensive realism
argues that great powers are concerned with maintaining the status quo
rather than maximising their power because often the **[cost of
expansion outweighs the benefits.]{.underline}** Defensive realism sees
security dilemmas as a problem where an increase in the power of one
state increases the insecurity of the other causing the latter to
increase its power. Under the conditions of defensive realism, great
powers would try to alleviate any security dilemmas rather than
exacerbate it. China's current policy seems to be firmly rooted in
defensive realism. Its policy seems to be aimed at maintaining the
balance of power rather than upsetting it. As the earlier section has
argued, China is not a revisionist power but a status quo one. The
analysts like Shiping Tang are convinced that China's security strategy
flows out of its realisation of the security dilemma whereby the
**[Chinese leaders have understood that an aggressive expansionist
strategy would just lead to counterbalancing alliances.]{.underline}**
"This recognition has led China to adopt a defensive realism-rooted
security strategy emphasising moderation, self-restraint and security
cooperation."57 Moreover, China's military modernisation, its Taiwan
policy and its increased policies in the South China Sea also make more
sense if seen through the lens of defensive realism. China's Taiwan
policy may be more geared towards preventing redistribution of power in
the region. Since the US is providing arms assistance to Taiwan, China
may be averse to the US aiding Taiwan's independence ─ the latter issue
is one where China has made clear that independence is not acceptable to
China. Similarly, there is good evidence that China's military
modernisation programmes and training exercises since the Taiwan Strait
Crisis of 1996 are aimed partially at dealing with the issue of the
Taiwanese separation.58 On the question of whether China is balancing
against the US, Johnston says, "There seems to be little doubt that
China's military modernisation programme since the mid-1990s has been
aimed in large measure at developing capabilities to deter or slow the
application of the US military power in the region."59 It would then
seem that China is not concerned with gaining power or projecting its
powers but with balancing against a predominance of the US power in the
region. **[China has not shown any signs of hegemonic behaviour as a lot
of Western analysts feared]{.underline}**. Instead of guided by
offensive realism, China's policies seem to be guided by defensive
realism where it is concerned with survival and with maintaining its
position in the system. Just as the US fears China's hegemonic rise,
China also fears the increase of the US influence in the region and its
talk of containing China. China's policy may change in the future to
display hegemonic tendencies. However, at present, **[there is not much
evidence to support the theory of offensive realism.]{.underline}**

**[Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense submitted its]{.underline}**
2015 **[report on]{.underline}** mainland **[China's
military]{.underline}** to the Taiwanese legislature yesterday. **[The
report noted a variety of scenarios under which]{.underline}** China's
People's Liberation Army (**[PLA]{.underline}**) **[might invade
Taiwan]{.underline}**, and outlined the possible attack strategy. The
MND report noted that leaders in Beijing are concerned about the 2016
presidential elections in Taiwan. Tsai Ing-wen, the candidate for the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is currently leading in
the polls, and Beijing has not-so-fond memories of the previous DPP
president, Chen Shui-bian. The MND suggested that recent PLA drills
seeming to simulate an attack on Taipei, Taiwan's capital, were a direct
result of Beijing's worries. The report said that **[Beijing might
decide to invade Taiwan under a number of circumstances: if Taiwan
declares independence or takes steps toward de jure independence; if
Taiwan obtains nuclear weapons; if foreign troops are deployed in
Taiwan; if there is extreme civil unrest or other internal chaos in
Taiwan; if foreign forces interfere in Taiwan's affairs; or if Taiwan
delays cross-strait negotiations on eventual
reunification]{.underline}**. In 2005, when **[Beijing]{.underline}**
was concerned about the possibility of a move toward Taiwanese
independence under President Chen, it **[passed an "Anti-Secession Law,"
which made it clear that Beijing will use "non-peaceful means" if it
believes that Taiwan is moving toward independence. The law also allows
for the use of force against Taiwan if "possibilities for a peaceful
re-unification should be completely exhausted."]{.underline}** It's that
last point that has always worried Taiwan's leaders -- the possibility
that Beijing could order an invasion simply because it believes talks on
reunification are going nowhere. As for how China would attack Taiwan,
the MND said **[the PLA would]{.underline}** probably **[use a
combination of military threats and a blockade against Taiwan to
intimidate Taiwanese. Then Beijing would move to use missiles against
Taiwan's military and political centers]{.underline}**. According to the
MND, the PLA's Second Artillery Crops currently has 1,500 missiles
deployed against Taiwan. **[After missile attacks, the PLA would use
both aircraft and amphibious vehicles to mount an actual
invasion.]{.underline}**

Realist Power Struggle: US-China-Taiwan What does it mean to say 'the
China-Taiwan relationship'? **[[For a structural realist there is an
obvious reality with respect to Taiwan]{.mark}, [but it begins with the
US and the PRC]{.mark}, which are [both concerned with]{.mark} the
[potential damage]{.mark} that the other could do to their national
security and economies.]{.underline}**14 **[[These concerns result from
each]{.mark} nation-[state's desire to dominate]{.mark} the politics and
economics of [the region,]{.mark}]{.underline}** and both possess
substantial resources in this regard, including large numbers and types
of military weapons, large portions of their citizenry engaged in their
militaries, sizeable economies, vast networks of trading partners and
linkages, and considerable financial resources and influence. **[Given
the military resources each possesses, combined with the trade linkages
they have developed with one another, both nation-states seek to avoid
direct military confrontations with one another. Yet [they]{.mark} also
simultaneously [seek to balance]{.mark} one another's military and
economic [power in order to avoid any advantage]{.mark} the other might
accrue [in their competition for regional domination.]{.mark} [From a
structural realist perspective]{.mark}, [Taiwan represents a]{.mark}
third and relatively [weaker entity]{.mark} in the mix. For the PRC,
Taiwan represents unfinished business.]{.underline}**15 Originally a
province of China, Taiwan is an island 100 miles off the coast of
China's Fukien province, and the body of water that separates them, the
Taiwan Strait, is a major commercial shipping avenue. Taiwan had been
annexed to and occupied by the Japanese from 1895 until 1945 when it was
returned to China. When the decades-long Chinese civil war culminated in
a communist victory over the mainland in 1949, remnants of the
US-supported Nationalists (Kuomintang or KMT) escaped to the island and
established their own government, the Republic of China (ROC). From its
inception, the ROC was intended to be a temporary solution. The
Nationalists argued that they were the sole legitimate government of
China and insisted that they would some day re-conquer the mainland.
Meanwhile the PRC made plans to reclaim Taiwan after it had consolidated
power on the mainland. What prevented this invasion was the US interest
in balancing Chinese aggression in light of the Korean War.
**[Throughout the 1950s and 1960s [Taiwan became the cornerstone
in]{.mark} the [US]{.mark} Cold War [containment]{.mark} strategy [in
Asia.]{.mark} [The US sent naval forces]{.mark} in[to]{.mark} the
[Taiwan]{.mark} Strait [several times in response to Chinese
provocations]{.mark}, it supplied the ROC with economic aid, and it
signed a mutual defense treaty with it in 1954.]{.underline}** This Cold
War context changed by the early 1970s, however, as China had by then
developed a mutual interest with the US in counter-balancing the Soviet
Union, and the US and China explored the possibility of improved
relations. In 1979 the US established full diplomatic relations with the
PRC, terminated its 1954 mutual security pact with Taiwan, and
reaffirmed the one-China principle that there is only one China and
Taiwan is a part of it. Simultaneously, however, the US adopted the 1979
Taiwan Relations Act, which declared that the US has a commitment to
Taiwan's security and is obligated to sell sophisticated defensive arms
to it. The US has also consistently argued it has a right to protect
Taiwan from the PRC, and in 1996 it dispatched two aircraft carrier
groups to the region in response to Chinese military activities in the
strait. **[[The triangular relationship between the US, the PRC, and the
ROC is replete with strategic deterrent
calculations.]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[The US attempts to pacify
China]{.mark} with regards to Taiwan [while also containing
China]{.mark} and protecting Taiwan from it.]{.underline}** The PRC
attempts to intimidate Taiwan while preventing direct US involvement in
their bilateral conflict. And the ROC seeks to maintain and increase its
independence from China while being careful not to alienate American
support. **[[This trilateral]{.mark} structural [relationship
can]{.mark} also [be examined from a]{.mark} neoclassical [realist
perspective]{.mark}, which focuses on the domestic politics of these
states.]{.underline}** Competing subgroups within the US, the PRC, and
the ROC emphasise either cooperative economic linkages or militaristic
policies in their relationships with one another. The extent to which
any of these particular subgroups are in ascendance results from
electoral competition in the US and the ROC, and internal bureaucratic
struggles in the PRC.16 Taiwan's development into a full-fledged
democracy in the 1990s has increased hostilities between the ROC and the
PRC, because democratisation allowed the main pro-independence political
party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), to gain control over and
utilise state power in the pursuit of its nationalist policies.
**[[Given]{.mark} [neoclassical realism's concern with non-systemic
variables]{.mark}, [the impact of identity formation on intra-state
politics in Taiwan is particularly important]{.mark}. The DPP and other
pro-independence groups are intimately linked to a Taiwanese identity
that sees itself as distinct from that of mainland China.]{.underline}**
These Taiwanese, who emigrated from Mainland China before World War II
and may be divided into two groups (Hoklos and Hakkas) based on
linguistic differences, constitute eighty five percent of the
population17 'Mainlanders' are the Mandarinspeaking KMT who retreated to
Taiwan after WWII; they constitute only fourteen percent of the
population. As long as the Nationalists prevailed electorally, Taiwan
pursued a foreign policy with China that subtly mixed accommodation
(including the public acceptance of the oneChina principle) and
resistance (such as pursuing sovereign membership in IGOs). Under the
DPP, on the other hand, Taiwan has declared its intention to become a
full-fledged sovereign nation-state within the next ten years; something
the PRC has consistently indicated it will use force to prevent. These
internal developments make conflict between the PRC and the ROC even
more likely than international structural considerations alone would
have done. Given US strategic interests in the region, the Taiwan Strait
is, as David Lampton, Director of China Studies at John Hopkins
observes, 'the only probable place . . . where two big nuclear powers
could come into conflict'. **[Postmodern Recognition and Expressions of
Doubt [From a postmodern perspective, power is already at play]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} the ways in which a [realist analysis]{.mark} describes and
discusses what it has supposedly objectively framed as a potentially
dangerous flashpoint.]{.underline}**19 But how can postmodernism
maintain that **[[power is implicit in the very act of describing the
realist version of 'reality']{.underline}]{.mark}**? Can this exercise
of power be drawn out and made visible? The key lies in explicating the
postmodern claim that not only is IR a discursive process, but that it
is 'a process of knowledge as power'.20 Starting from this perspective,
power is understood in terms of its relational context. **[[Power
relations are made known where attempts are made to bring ambiguity
under control]{.mark}, where a [privileged interpretation
emerges]{.mark}, or where conduct is disciplined and discourse
limited.]{.underline}**21 Thus when we choose to comprehend the world in
a certain way, we thereby impose an order on it which must inevitably be
held in place by power; **[[a power which simultaneously produces us as
'knowers' of the world and disciplines us to know the world in
accordance with an established mode of
certitude]{.underline}]{.mark}**.22 **[[Realism is the established mode
of certitude through which we have come to know the international, and
it centers on national security as power
politics.]{.underline}]{.mark}** According to Taiwan's 'Guidelines for
National Unification' issued in 1991, for example, any timeframe for the
unification of Taiwan and China must 'respect the rights and interests
of the people in the Taiwan area, and protect their security and
welfare'.23 **[[Realism's national security]{.mark} power/knowledge
[grid establishes the order whereby security and welfare are conflated
with the state and deployed]{.mark} [to justify]{.mark} the use (or
threat) of [violence in order to maintain that discursive equation of
state and security]{.mark}/welfare]{.underline}**. It is this frame of
sovereign certitude that a postmodern analysis seeks to disrupt. **[[It
is not]{.mark},]{.underline}** as George suggests, **[[that
postmodernists are attempting to]{.mark} somehow [move beyond power, but
rather]{.mark} that [they]{.mark} are attempting to [shift the focus of
the knowledge/power grid through which we represent the world of
IR]{.mark}.]{.underline}**24 **[In order [to radically question the
singular]{.mark}, irreducible [version of reality imposed on the world
via realist politics]{.mark}, [we]{.mark} need to [look to the various
marginal sites]{.mark} and be attentive to what]{.underline}** Ashley
refers to as **[the 'reality of human struggles to make life go
on'.]{.underline}**25 We need to look at the various local sites
**[[where identity and territoriality have been thrown into radical
doubt]{.mark}. This [recognition of radical doubt opens a space for
individuals to question and resist those who would marshal the forces of
violence in the name of territorial certitude]{.mark}.]{.underline}**26
This recognition shifts us from relations of power that define security
in terms of national security, to relations of power that exceed the
limited purview of states. **[[One site to deconstruct is the
representation of two titanic foes]{.mark}, [the US and China, squaring
off in a primordial contest between good and
evil.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[Such a]{.mark} dichotomous
representational [frame oversimplifies myriad complexities and also
encourages political practices which]{.mark} necessarily [categorise
actions]{.mark}, words and thoughts [as]{.mark}
[either/or.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Framing China as a 'looming menace'
scripts a scenario whereby cross-strait relations become denotated as
one of the most dangerous sites in global politics. This script easily
roles over into an attitude of resignation like that clearly expressed
by Kurt Campbell, Director of the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, when he admits that it appears as if almost inexorable forces
are at work in the straits area.27 Disrupting this realist
representation of reality entails drawing out counter narratives.
Certainly one marginal site where acts of resistance and transgression
are transpiring is in the movement of Taiwan's indigenous peoples for
recognition and cultural survival. There are currently eleven major
indigenous peoples in Taiwan who make up less than two percent of the
total population. Prejudice, pressures to assimilate and a general
underprivileged status constitute the context within which they struggle
to make life go on. It is here, in their marginal existence, that the
power deployed to construct an overarching, unified, national Taiwanese
identity becomes visible. Many of these groups have become politically
active at both the local and national levels in order to promote the
welfare of their communities and to maintain their expression of
difference.28 They fear the narrative power of Taiwanese national
identity, which threatens to subsume and eventually erase their cultural
and historical memory.29 These are marginalised sites of difference, yet
they locate a possibility that contests the inevitability of a move
toward the solidification of one homogenising national Taiwanese
identity. In these sites of struggle security issues are also of
paramount concern, but the security issues here are qualitatively
different than those glimpsed from the triangulation of US, Chinese, and
Taiwanese representations of national security. **[[These sites are
fraught with doubt]{.mark}, [contingency and chance]{.mark}, and [they
expose how focusing on titanic struggles]{.mark} [between]{.mark}
competing [national identities and strategic foes is merely an attempt
to impose a simplistic order on the complexity of life
itself]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[[It is not that the state is
irrelevant to postmodern concerns]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but **[in
order to problematise discourses that presume the inevitability and
historical necessity of the state, [we must locate sites of contestation
that do not conflate state security and survival with that of
individuals or communities.]{.mark}]{.underline}** It is the rupture
between these paradoxical positions that postmodernism seeks to
explore.30 **[[It is not that change is not possible in
realism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[or that alternative sites of struggle
are not important,]{.underline}** but the parameters of and sites of
struggle for change highlighted by postmodernism seem analytically
misplaced. **[If 'realism' is not simply explanation by ivory-tower
academics but is what states and policy-makers do]{.underline}** (it is,
after all, Chinese and US officials who designate one another as
menaces, and it is Taiwanese state officials who equate national
security and welfare in their own documents), **[then why study the
marginalised instead of the states and policy-makers involved? Why not
talk about change within the context of state-society politics and among
state policy-makers?]{.underline}** The state is one of the ultimate
sites of political, economic, and social struggle and power in
contemporary world politics, and **[[it seems counter-productive to
look]{.mark} [for]{.mark} and promote [change in representative
practices while]{.mark} simultaneously [ignoring the state and its
relationship to these alternative sites of representation]{.mark}. If
change is both possible and afoot in]{.underline}** our representations
of the world, shouldn't it be recognisable in the politics of and
struggle over the state and its functions in society? **[[The fact that
many states]{.mark}, such as the US and the ROC, [are democracies
underscores this point]{.mark}, since [they have been institutionally
designed to respond to majorities and minorities within their
societies.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Even China's totalitarian regime
responds to multiple interests emanating from its society. Hence it is
not clear to realists why a discussion of the marginalised does not also
involve understanding the structural mechanisms whereby doubt and
uncertainty are translated into political practice. Conversely, while
there is a great deal of radical doubt in the world, but not all of it
matters to individual security or territorial violence and competition
among nation-states. **[[If the radical doubt engendered by the
marginalised]{.mark} (in this case, two percent of Taiwan's population)
[is not realised through state structures, then studying them
won't]{.mark} [get us]{.mark} any [closer to understanding
change]{.mark} and stasis in the China-Taiwan
relationship.]{.underline}** Wouldn't our understanding of change in
this triangular relationship be better served by examining how the
majority and the minority interact within the political structures,
parties, and interest groups of the US, the PRC, and the ROC and, in so
doing, effect the politics and behavior of the other states involved?

#### Classical discourse surrounding international relations has been weaponized against china to protect the racialized American psyche -- in the face of hegemonic discourse the affirmative engages in a logic of interpretation which ruptures hegemonic thought processes -- only though this process can we demonstrate how our threats are in fact constructed

International Relations and imagery: from estrangement to conciliation
As already noted, this book speaks primarily to the **[[IR-dominated
policy lit]{.mark}erature]{.underline}**, the principal silence of which
is that it **[[has]{.mark} traditionally [neglected to examine the role
of American images of China in the enactment of]{.mark} US China
[policy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This paucity of attention is explained
largely by the historical tendency of IR to ignore the significance of
representational processes to the daily mechanics of global affairs. Yet
when John King Fairbank noted that 'the "truth" about China is
\[always\] in our heads', he pointed to the central role of imagery in
providing any number of possible realities about that country and its
people.52 He argued, in effect, that **[[China is an imaginative
geography]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[The world is a product of
interpretation]{.mark}, and interpretations are [vulnerable to
disagreement and conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline}**53 Accordingly, the
evil and threatening Fu Manchu represents a particular truth about China
in equal measure to the genial and Americanised Charlie Chan. **[[This
precludes a]{.mark} strictly positivistic logic of explanation, the
purpose of which is to search for a [singular]{.mark}, definitive
[understanding]{.mark} [of]{.mark} what [China]{.mark} represents at any
given moment]{.underline}**. Instead, **[[a logic of
interpretation]{.mark}, [which concerns itself]{.mark} less with
identifying causality within international relations than it does [with
interrogating the consequences of representational processes,]{.mark}
[is required.]{.mark}]{.underline}**54 This is what enables the
transference from 'why' to 'how' questions described in the
introduction, since **[[the principal concern is not why]{.mark} the
United States has chosen to engage in certain practices towards China,
[but how those practices have been made possible through]{.mark} the
[historical production of subjective truth]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Social constructivist and postcolonial IR scholars are now among the
most active in formulating the types of ('how') questions about
representation and the interrelations of power and knowledge around
which this analysis is conducted.55 A key source of inspiration is
Edward Said's Orientalism, in which it is argued that, **[for centuries,
[the identity of the global East has been constructed and
reconstructed]{.mark} (as exotic, threatening, technologically inferior,
etc.) so as [to enable its domination by the
West]{.mark}.]{.underline}**56 As such, the Asian region (like any
other) is less an objective, natural reality than it is a product of
Western imaginations.57 It exists for the West, or so it appears in the
mind of the Orientalist. **[[The imaginative geography of China
has]{.underline}]{.mark}** always **[[been constructed within American
imaginations]{.underline}]{.mark}**, for American imaginations, **[[to
enable particular courses of US China policy.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Yet
while China has always been the product of American discourse and
representation, **[[the argument]{.mark} here [is not that ideas are the
primary]{.mark} or even singular [drivers of international
affairs]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[Crucially, [the intention is to
emphasise the co-constitution of the ideational and material
worlds]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As Alexander Wendt explains, the claim is
not that ideas are more important than power and interest, or that they
are autonomous from power and interest. **[[Power and interest
are]{.mark} just as [important]{.mark} and determining as before. [The
claim is rather that power and interest have the effects they do in
virtue of the ideas that make them up]{.mark}.]{.underline}**58 **[[To
suggest]{.underline}]{.mark}**, then, **[that American understandings
about China simply shift and evolve as a result of external
developments]{.underline}** -- most notably of China's behaviour, which,
as illustrated in the review of the literature above, has been a strong
tendency of many authors -- **[[and thus that they can be attributed
little or no consequence to the dynamics of]{.mark} Sino-US relations
and [the formulation of]{.mark} US China [policy, is fundamentally
misguided]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Increases in **[China's military
capabilities today]{.underline}**, for example, **[do
matter]{.underline}** (see Chapters 5 and 6). **[What is important,
however, is not simply the emergence of those capabilities, but that
China -- which so many people (rightly or wrongly) consider potentially
dangerous -- now possesses them]{.underline}**. Like China, India has a
large standing army, nuclear weapons, an increasing defence budget and
so on, but it is rarely perceived as a threat to the United States. The
UK's 500 nuclear weapons are considered less threatening to American
interests than North Korea's (unsophisticated and unreliable) five.59
Unavoidably, then, identity also matters. **[[Discourses]{.mark} and
imagery [define]{.mark}, to varying extents, [what China 'is' and how it
must be approached, regardless of its intentions]{.mark} or observable
behaviour]{.underline}**. Discourse and imagery: constructing the
reality of China American images of China are understood here to be the
products of discourse about that land and its people. Michel Foucault
described discourse as 'the general domain of all statements',
representing either a group of individual statements, or a regulated
practice which accounts for a number of statements.60 American
discourses of China are thus envisioned as the articulation of ideas
about that country in the broadest possible sense. Ultimately,
**[[American images of China constitute the discursive construction of
truth or reality about it]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Of course, imagery in
the form of art or photography, for example, is overtly visual rather
than discursive, yet, like that of the world around us, its meaning will
always be interpreted and articulated through language. For the purposes
of this analysis American images and representations of China are
considered synonymous. This is an assumption reinforced by Szalay et
al., who argue that 'images are selective, often affect-laden
representations of reality'.61 Peter Hays Gries explains that
**[[Americans look at China]{.mark} [as]{.mark} though staring at the
[inkblots of a Rorschach test]{.mark}, [revealing more about
themselves]{.mark} than about China itself.]{.underline}**62 This
central role of American identity in the construction of China is
reiterated by Jesperson: '\[American\] images of China have largely come
from Americans' assumptions about themselves', he argues.63 As outlined
already in this chapter, the relevant literatures as a whole do little
to support this claim. However, the identity of any actor is meaningless
without the presence of another because meaning itself is created in
discourse.64 **[This mutual constitution of opposing identities, of self
and other, is]{.underline}** articulated by David Campbell: '**[identity
-- whether personal or collective -- is not fixed by nature \... rather,
identity is constituted in relation to difference. But neither is
difference fixed by nature]{.underline}** . .. **[[Difference is
constituted in relation to identity]{.underline}]{.mark}**.'65 While the
extent to which discourses remain stable over time varies, **[[American
images of China]{.mark} -- [whether enduring or not]{.mark} -- [have
been manufactured from perceptions of]{.mark} [the identity of the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [itself]{.mark}]{.underline}**.66
However, the four key constructions of China examined with particular
focus throughout this book -- Idealised, Opportunity, Uncivilised and
Threatening China -- are examples of **[[images which have endured
because]{.mark}, to reaffirm, [their production and reproduction can be
traced to among the most intrinsic components of American
identity.]{.mark} [These]{.mark} types of [images can be likened
to]{.mark}]{.underline}** Said's notion of '**[[Latent
Orientalism']{.underline}]{.mark}**: **[[an]{.underline}]{.mark}**
underlying and 'almost **[[unconscious']{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[collectivity of shared ideas]{.mark} and beliefs [about the global
East which has preserved a]{.mark} '[unanimity, stability and
durability]{.mark}' [of representation]{.mark}.]{.underline}**67 As will
be shown, Idealised China became established from understandings about a
more scientifically enlightened and advanced United States.
**[Uncivilised [China has always been produced in relation to]{.mark}
presumed [superior]{.mark} standards of [American
civilisation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Opportunity China exists primarily
for particular American ideals of free international trade and open
markets. Threatening China has been produced to confirm the need to
secure the United States from external threat. In a broad sense, the
identity of the United States has traditionally been defined in part by
an imagined commitment to the values of democracy, personal liberty and
the free market.68 **[[This constitutes]{.mark} what has been termed a
[democratic-capitalist]{.mark} ideology, or
[ethos]{.mark}]{.underline}**.69 It is shown that images of China have
frequently been produced from these understandings, such as Uncivilised
China, which has been conceived as uncivilised because it lacks these
commitments and qualities. In addition, historically the United States
has been conceived as a predominantly White/Caucasian society.70 This
constitutes another powerful site from which China and the Chinese, as
'non-White', have been produced.71 Robert Blauner vividly describes the
power and longevity of the 'race issue' within the United States,
likening it to a 'gritty old boxer who just won't stay down'.72 **[[The
dominance of the White American population]{.mark}, he argues, [has
resulted in the 'internal colonialism' of non-Whites like the Chinese
who]{.mark}, to varying extents, [inhabit imbalanced power
relations]{.mark} which favour the former.]{.underline}**73 This
analysis shows that Chinese in America have been historically beholden
to political and economic arrangements over which they have had little
control. In Orientalism Said argued that during the nineteenth century,
all Europeans were racist or ethnocentric.74 The argument here is not
that the Chinese have been the consistent and uniform victims of
American racism; it is that race is a political, rather than a natural,
category, and powerful discourses have racially objectified the Chinese
as a non-White other without necessarily implying racist sentiment. Of
course, classificatory labels such as 'White' and 'non-White' are often
unhelpful and even meaningless. Indeed, Homi Bhabha challenges neat
delineations between cultures on the basis that they exist in a state of
perennial 'mixedness'.75 **[Yet identities are frequently and crudely
contrasted with others and, to reaffirm, American images of China
(racial or otherwise) need not be informed and/or sophisticated to
circulate]{.underline}**. What is important is that they do circulate,
with the capacity to represent selected realities about China and its
people. This analysis also demonstrates the historical persistence of
embedded understandings -- even into the twenty-first century -- that
China represents a cultural inferior of the United States. Such
perceptions have not been unique, uniform or timeless, yet, as Michael
Shapiro observes, **[the process of making others foreign most commonly
ensures their status as less-than-equal subjects]{.underline}**.76
Ikechi Mgbeoji argues that **[[Western]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(particularly European) **[[colonialism habitually propagated the
truth]{.mark} [that the only route for the non-West to become less
inferior was to aspire to the standards of the
West]{.mark}.]{.underline}**77 A comparable dynamic is revealed
throughout the chapters that follow, through ingrained expectations that
China must lessen its imagined inferiority by conforming to American
expectations. In this sense, **[[American images of China have]{.mark}
often [been produced within a paternalistic structure, wherein the
actions of the latter]{.mark} as the parental authority are understood
to [represent the best interests of the former.]{.mark}]{.underline}**78
These enduring assumptions are explained in part with reference to
implicit American understandings of 'exceptionalism', and of the United
States as a 'redeemer nation' with a responsibility to advance its
Enlightenment values abroad.79 American governmental papers, notes Bruce
Kuklick, have always advanced a vision of the world rooted in
Protestantism and the Enlightenment.80 **[In this analysis, [American
exceptionalism is most emphatically demonstrated by the construction of
China through negation]{.mark}, a strategy used [to deny the history of
foreign others]{.mark} [and construct (or deconstruct) their geographies
as]{.mark} a [blank spaces]{.mark}, or tabula rasas, [waiting to be
filled]{.mark}.]{.underline}**81 Ultimately, it is demonstrated that
across the history of Sino-US relations particular discourses of China,
like those outlined above, have become naturalised statements of fact
and accepted simply as what is.82 This has generated common sense, a
form of knowledge that goes unquestioned since it is assumed to be a
true reflection of reality.83 **[[Common sense knowledges are almost
unconsciously reproduced and rarely scrutinised or
challenged]{.underline}]{.mark}**.84 This was evident throughout much of
the late nineteenth century and during the early Cold War, for example,
when Threatening China seemingly posed a danger to White America (see
Chapters 2 and 3 respectively). **[[The naturalisation of discourses
means that they have never been free or unrestricted, but]{.mark},
rather, moulded and [constrained as the product of systemic regulations
which promote selected ideas and suppress
others]{.mark}.]{.underline}**85 Foucault refers to these regulations as
societal 'rules of exclusion'.86 This ensures that discourse is always
'controlled, selected \[and\] organised' so that the ideas of some are
accepted, whereas those of others are ignored or rejected and considered
beyond the lines of acceptable argument.87 Walter Lippmann put it
another way, suggesting that 'in the great blooming, buzzing confusion
of the outer world we pick out what our culture has already defined for
us'.88 As certain discourses of China have been promoted as common
sense, others have inevitably been marginalised and silenced. For much
of the Cold War, for example, discourses of Opportunity and Idealised
China were subdued within American imaginations as Threatening and
Uncivilised China became dominant. Yet **[[discourse is a site from
which power can be challenged and undermined]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[meaning [the logic that discourses of China claim to advance
can]{.mark} always [be questioned and opposed]{.mark}]{.underline}**.89
'\[W\]here there is power,' argued Foucault, 'there is resistance'.90
Resistance is a highly contested concept, especially within postcolonial
IR, but here resistance discourses are those which challenge the most
powerful and established American ideas about China, exposing their
vulnerability and introducing alternative modes of thinking. Discourses
may be 'buried or masked' by rules of exclusion and deemed inferior,
naive or inadequately articulated.91 'Unofficial' or 'subjugated'
knowledges about China, however, always have the potential to
reappear.92 Moreover, **[[discourses are not discrete or isolated units
of analysis]{.mark}. [Their peripheries are open, overlapping and
constituted by others]{.mark}.]{.underline}**93 In this analysis it is
shown that the four key constructions of China have often coexisted, and
have on occasions become mutually reinforcing. Discourses of China
should also not be essentialised, and throughout the chapters that
follow it is shown that while such **[[constructions as Threatening and
inferior China have resurfaced]{.mark} in recognisable forms, [they
have]{.mark} always [been in a perpetual state of
flux]{.mark}.]{.underline}**94 **[They have evolved and been modified to
meet new circumstances and new frames of reference so that
today]{.underline}**, for example, just like in the nineteenth century,
the assumption remains that China should conform to the (superior)
standards of Western civilisation, yet it is no longer brazenly referred
to as 'uncivilised' and the relevant imagery is advanced in more subtle
forms (see Chapter 6). Ultimately, the discursive production of American
images of China, and the resulting construction of truths and realities,
means they have been the historical subjects of classification
strategies. The process of classification relies upon stereotypes, or
'controlling images', whereby individuals and groups are imbued with
quick and easy representations for the purpose of identification.95
Importantly, then, and as the term 'controlling image' implies, those
representations have always been imbued with a form of power. The power
of representation: **[[political possibility]{.mark} and US China policy
Power in global affairs [is not merely the capacity of states to exert
material force; it exists in less conventional forms and
spaces]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In IR it is now a widely contested
concept, becoming increasingly denaturalised, dispersed and ultimately
devoid of an assumed centre.96 Power is understood by Foucault to be
inextricable from knowledge, such that one cannot be advanced in the
absence of the other.97 **[[The result is a power/knowledge nexus which
precludes the advancement of discourse and the establishment of truth as
neutral or dispassionate endeavours]{.mark}.98 This means that [American
discourses and imagery of China have never been produced
objectively]{.mark} or in the absence of purpose and
intent]{.underline}**. **[[Their dissemination must be acknowledged as a
performance of power, however seemingly innocent or
benign.]{.mark}]{.underline}** As will be shown throughout the chapters
that follow, American representations of China have regularly been
advanced with a clear agenda. This occurred during the latter half of
the nineteenth century when ideas about a China 'threat' were promoted
by those who openly favoured restrictions against Chinese immigrations,
and during the Cold War when propaganda depicted 'Red' China in highly
threatening terms in support of the United States' communist containment
policy (see Chapter 4). Equally, and as Fairclough argues, common sense
discourses may represent an 'ideological sleight of hand' by advancing
an opinion or point of view which is disguised as truth or fact.99 That
which becomes common sense is largely determined by comparatively more
powerful actors.100 Thus, **[imagery can be circulated with an explicit
motivation but, and as already suggested, it can also be reproduced
almost unconsciously]{.underline}**. In line with Said's notion of
Latent Orientalism, ideas can become naturalised and accepted 'fact', as
Gramsci's organic intellectuals across society engage in their promotion
and continuation because as 'truths' they appear so unproblematic.
Historically, Sino-American relations of power have been dominated by
the United States both in terms of material capability and of ideational
forces or power/knowledge. **[As 'a circulating medium', however, [power
is not inevitably suppressive, nor is it the possession of individuals
or institutions. It is everywhere, working productively through social
relations and in the construction of reality as much as of the actors
within it]{.mark}.]{.underline}**101 Accordingly, while the power of
representation may appear readily observable in late nineteenth century
American newspaper articles which vehemently opposed Chinese immigration
to the United States, for example, it was just as inextricable from the
arguments of those who wrote positively of a more civilised land and
people. It would be erroneous to suggest, then, that China and the
Chinese have been the perpetual victims of American power (discursive or
material). Material forces are only attributed meaning for use as a
result of certain knowledges about them.102 In other words, **[[it is
discourse -- or power/knowledge -- which ensures that material
capabilities can be utilised, and in what manner]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
As Doty explains, the fact that the United States claims unrivalled
material power is undeniably important. **[However, the US does not
consider invading every country over which it boasts military
superiority or, indeed, against which it exhibits
grievance]{.underline}**.103 **[[That military power is constituted by
understandings of identity, and of who to invade (among other things)
and who not.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Discourse, notes Obeyesekere, 'is
about practice.. . . Insofar as discourse evolves it begins to affect
the practice'.104 **[International relations, therefore, represents an
arena of power that is both political and discursive, wherein discourses
create certain political possibilities and preclude
others.]{.underline}**105 Yet such a reassessment of power does not
entirely preclude an appreciation for those which preceded it.106 To
reiterate, the suggestion is not that ideas are more important than, or
distinct from, material power. Material power is affective as a result
of the ideas of which it is constituted.107 David Campbell explains that
foreign policy is an extension to the international realm of the human
tendency to identify unfamiliar others as alien and foreign.108 Richard
Ashley similarly notes that modern statecraft is more accurately termed
'modern mancraft'.109 Such societal discourses of foreignness are
discourses of separation and difference by which states are made foreign
from one other in a 'specific sort of boundary producing political
performance'.110 **[[It is argued here that the production and
dissemination of American images of China constitutes this
performance]{.mark}, [and represents the]{.mark} ubiquitous [process by
which China and the Chinese are made foreign]{.mark} from the United
States [for the purpose of enabling US China
policies]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As Campbell puts it, foreign policy
represents the international 'inscription of foreignness'.111 **[[This
analysis will demonstrate that the most stable and enduring images of
China]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Threatening, Uncivilised, etc.) **[[have
traditionally been comparatively active in this regard]{.mark}, [to
explain not why particular]{.mark} American [foreign policies towards
China have occurred, but how they have been made
possible.]{.mark}]{.underline}** As outlined in the introduction, this
study shows that **[[American images of]{.mark}
[China]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- including those which circulate in the
present day -- have frequently been those of an inferior or unequal land
and people expected to conform to the superior values of American
identity such as democracy and capitalism. **[[The construction of
foreign others as]{.mark} barbaric, [uncivilised]{.mark}, etc., [has
historically enabled and legitimised the appropriation of]{.mark}
(particularly [non-Western]{.mark}) [lands]{.mark} and resources, as
well [as the subjugation and extermination of
people]{.mark}.]{.underline}**112 Ellingson agrees, noting that the
historical construction of non-Europeans as 'lower' peoples has been at
the heart of the establishment of a global European hegemony.113 The
study also shows that China's imagined inferiority has commonly been
articulated through racial discourse and imagery. Race here represents
an especially powerful site of identity construction from which images
of a nonWhite China have been produced, and is shown to have been an
integral component of the foreign policy process at numerable historical
junctures.114 Glazer and Moynihan, for instance, argue that immigration
has long been, and remains, the most important determinant of American
foreign policy because it responds so powerfully to the ethnic
composition of the United States.115 Jan Pierterse describes racism as
'the psychology of imperialism', with the capacity to justify overseas
domination.116 **[[American discourses and imagery of China]{.mark},
then, [have consistently determined the boundaries of the politically
possible by being]{.mark} inextricable from, and [complicit
within]{.mark}, [every stage of the formulation, enactment and
justification of US China policy]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} The
nature and purpose of that policy, however, must be reconsidered. In the
previous section it was shown that throughout the relevant literatures
US China policy has been conceived in relatively restrictive terms as a
'bridge' between two states.117 This analysis further draws from the
work of Campbell, who argues that foreign policy not only represents the
international inscription of societal discourses of separation and
difference, but actively reaffirms them.118 Acts of foreign policy, in
short, impose particular interpretations of the world, thereby
reproducing them.119 US China policy is shown here to be a political
performance active within the construction of China's identity as well
as that of the United States, perpetuating the cycle of discursive
difference so that the production of imagery continues. **[For example,
[the]{.mark} possibility of US involvement in the nineteenth-century
[opium wars was not only]{.mark} introduced by [discourse and
imagery]{.mark} of Uncivilised China, [it was also an act which itself
reinforced the representational processes of which it was
constituted]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} Specifically, and as shown
in Chapter 2, it reproduced Uncivilised China in comparison to the more
civilised United States by affirming the requirement of the former to
modernise to what were considered more enlightened Western practices and
values. It makes no sense to assume that the enactment of US China
policy signals the end of discourse's capacity to construct reality and
social actors. Instead it carries on, reproducing the understandings
upon which policies rely and in which they are framed, to be relied upon
again in the future. Related to this point, this book also demonstrates
that **[US China policy has consistently worked not only in the
construction of identity, but also in the protection of the identity of
the United States when seemingly threatened by that of
China.]{.underline}**120 **[Danger can be ascribed to otherness wherever
it may be found.]{.underline}**121 Yet not all potential dangers are
interpreted as such. The designation of threat is therefore at least
partly constitutive of representational processes which determine what
is dangerous and what is not.122 As Wendt explains, every state in the
world does not represent a danger to every other, and so international
threats must be constitutive of particular ideas which make them
interpretable as such.123 **[This means that [Sino-US relations must be
understood as boundary-producing rituals in which 'dangers']{.mark} from
China, when identified, [are not merely from calculations of material
threat, but are partly the result of subjective
interpretation]{.mark}.]{.underline}**124 In this book it is argued that
**[[a key purpose of depicting China as a threat has been to protect the
components of American identity]{.mark} (primarily racial and
ideological) [deemed most fundamental to its being]{.mark}. As such,
[representations of a threatening China have most commonly been advanced
by]{.mark}, and served the interests of, [those who support]{.mark}
[actions to defend that identity]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It is shown
that this has included politicians and policymaking circles, such as
those within the administration of President Harry Truman which
implemented the Cold War containment of the PRC (Chapter 4). It also
exposes the complicity of other societal individuals and institutions,
including elements of the late-nineteenthcentury American media which
supported restrictions against Chinese immigration to the Western United
States (Chapter 2). **[To some extent, [dangers in the international
realm always constitute threats to identity]{.mark}]{.underline}**.125
In the analysis which follows, **[it is shown that [this has been
especially evident during moments of crisis (or 'rupture') to American
identity]{.mark} [which demonstrate most emphatically how dangers are
socially constructed]{.mark}]{.underline}**.126 **[[Crises of identity
occur when the existing order is considered in danger of
collapse.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The prevailing authority is seen to be
weakened and rhetoric over how to reassert the 'natural' identity
intensifies.127 The Cold War represents one such moment of crisis for
American identity, as Washington's containment policy functioned to
protect the latter from the 'threatening' values of communist Red China,
which conflicted with those of the democratic-capitalist United States.
**[This is not to suggest that danger is non-material. Indeed,
representational processes separate 'us' from 'them' through a logic of
difference which determines the relative salience of material factors in
the assessment of external threats]{.underline}**.128 Yet as Hixson
asserts, '\[f\]oreign policy plays a profoundly significant role in the

identity',129 and **[[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has]{.mark}

practices for understandings about its

**[[Rethinking the terms of the debate]{.mark}]{.underline}** Chan et
al. (2018, 23) argue that, **[as social and political constructions, the
[labels of 'revisionism' and the 'status quo' 'are often intended to
frame discourses intended for political persuasion and mobilization,
and]{.mark} sometimes [bear little correspondence with what the
pertinent states have said and done']{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[The
ideas [these labels]{.mark} bring, they suggest, can [exert power and
influence on our understandings about the world even when grounded upon
questionable evidence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This article has argued
that **[the [IR concepts of revisionism and the status quo]{.mark}, as
they [are]{.mark} typically deployed, are [constructions in the form of
'ordering narratives' of morality and progress]{.mark},
[constituting]{.mark} long-established and, to a significant extent,
[autobiographical stories]{.mark}---or conceptual narratives---[of a
Western dominated discipline]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[[Through]{.mark}
their [selectivity of characters, plotlines and sequences of events in
stories of an essentially benevolent and progressive Western world
order,]{.mark} [these narratives have framed and constrained debate
across historical waves of study,]{.mark} their broadly unchallenged
logic now being transposed on to a 'rising' China.]{.underline}** As
modes or methods of enquiry, these narratives have promoted
understandings of world order and of the characters within it. To
varying extents, Morganthau, Gilpin and others---as both scholars and
narrators---articulated conceptions of international revisionism and the
status quo which (albeit often subtly) privileged the Anglo-American,
and later the wider Western, world in the making of an essentially
benevolent and progressive system, simultaneously entrenching stories of
external others who came late to threaten its achievements. **[[Coated
in the subliminal Eurocentism]{.mark}]{.underline}** described by
Hobson, **[[the]{.mark} potential [analytical value of these concepts
has]{.mark} always [been stifled]{.mark}]{.underline}**; **[formulated
as inherently problematic and misleading descriptors of international
actors and behaviours]{.underline}**, **[[they have reinforced overly
simplistic conceptions of a Western Self versus a non-Western
Other]{.mark}, [promoting]{.mark} rather than addressing suspicions and
[tensions in the international arena]{.mark} and pervading wider public
narratives such as those of the current US
administration.]{.underline}** To reiterate, **[[the argument is not
that China should be omitted from the study of structural
changes]{.mark} to twenty-first-century global affairs]{.underline}**,
nor is it todeny challenges associated with China's authoritarian model
of governance and development. **[[Yet, as we have seen,
assessments]{.mark} and classifications of revisionism [are contingent
and narrativized]{.mark} and, traditionally, authored principally [in
the West]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Those who directly examine whether
'rising' China exists as a revisionist actor broadly agree it does not.
However, **[[China remains the primary focus of study of international
revisionism]{.mark}, [while]{.mark} [actors like the EU escape such
attention]{.mark} despite seemingly fulfilling revisionist criteria
formulated by some IR scholars themselves.]{.underline}** Neither, then,
is the argument that the terms 'revisionism' and 'status quo' should
necessarily be removed from the lexicon. It is that **[[examinations of
their disciplinary formations]{.mark} [and the conditions from which
they derive meaning help us recognize them as contingent constructs and,
from a position of greater self-reflection, enable efforts to resolve
the problems and contradictions they bring.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The
bias towards upholding conventional IR wisdom is increasingly being
interrogated. Stephen Walt speaks of history as 'a set of competing,
overlapping, but still distinct narratives ... The past does not reveal
itself to us openly; it is interpreted, debated, and constructed for us
by historians of various kinds and by society as a whole' (Walt 2018).
In doing so, he emphasizes the role of narratives in the production and
perpetuation of 'truths' of how the world came to be. Walt also connects
the tendency of IR 'to reinforce the stale bipartisan consensus behind
"liberal hegemony" and the necessity for "U.S. leadership"', or, in the
words of the Trump administration, the US as a 'responsible steward' of
order (Ministry of External Affairs 2017). In their explication of
conceptual or scholarly narratives, Somers and Gibson (1994, 62)
**[argue that [researchers should]{.mark} seek to '[develop a social
analytic vocabulary that can accommodate]{.mark} the contention that
[social life, social organizations, social action, and social identities
are narratively]{.mark}, that is, [temporally and relationally
constructed']{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[The duty of IR]{.mark}, then,
[should be to work for an analytical logic and language that recognize
the narrativized nature of international revisionism]{.mark} and the
status quo, [and of international order itself]{.mark}]{.underline}**. 7
**[[Attempts at such vocabularies]{.mark} so far [problematize]{.mark}
either [geographical/historical or conceptual boundaries and
binaries]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In his call for a global IR, for
example, Acharya (2014) urges scholars **[[to look beyond the
Westphalian model]{.mark} of order [to]{.mark} those of historical
periods and regions, as well as [different frameworks of relations
including alternative forms of regionalism]{.mark}]{.underline}** (see
Ling and Nakamura 2019; Chen and Shimizu 2019). Critiquing IR for
overlooking peaceful interactions and bidirectional learning between the
West and non-West, Acharya points to a resulting loss of mutual respect
(Acharya 2014, 656). **[[Scholars]{.underline}]{.mark}** such as
Stuenkel (2016) and Hobson (2004) **[[critique]{.underline}]{.mark}**
what they consider **[[false dichotomies between the West and
non-West]{.mark}, [and their accompanying narratives of Western-derived
modernity]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In other words, **[[without entrenched
and historically inaccurate binaries between 'a moral and progressive
West' and an 'immoral and uncivilized rest']{.mark}, equally
[established notions of revisionism and status quo would be exposed as
more problematic]{.mark}. [Seeking to break or expand conceptual
boundaries, scholars offer 'new' imaginaries or
vocabularies.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Womack, for example, proposes
replacing 'status quo' (the situation of the present) and our
understanding that it represents the norm, with 'status ad quem', 'the
situation to which (we are moving in the future)'. In his understanding,
discussions on whether China supports the 'status quo' or not are
misplaced, as world politics is not a static or fixed condition.
Accordingly, 'a "status ad quem power" would be one whose policies were
appropriate and sustainable in the emerging new order' (Womack 2015,
135). Ling (2018) explores US--China relations through different
theoretical, ontological and even 'spiritual' lenses, including 'Daoist
trialectics', while Pan (2018) develops a 'holographic relational
ontology' of China's rise. Kavalski (2018) uses the notion of guanxi to
advance existing relational approaches by focusing on the
interconnectedness of knowledge production in the West and 'non-West'.
**[[Collectively, these approaches offer more complex narratives of
China's 'rise' than the 'binary scenarios of either a hegemonic
challenge to the Western-dominant order or a linear integration into
it']{.underline}]{.mark}** (Pan 2018, 19), **[in which both [China and
'the West' are treated as 'self-enclosed and self-interested units of
power]{.mark}']{.underline}** (Ling 2018, 5). While increased complexity
is probably not in high demand with policymakers who favour simpler
accounts, **[[we find one of our central tasks as
scholar-narrators]{.mark} [in exposing what we see as problems with
dominant accounts and in highlighting alternative
voices]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As noted by Kavalski (2018, 3): 'IR
theorizing \[still\] needs to learn and employ different languages if it
is to offer a richer and more nuanced account of the complex and
heterogenous global life it seeks to comprehend.'

#### Thus The Plan: The United States federal government should substantially reduce its Foreign Military Sales and Direct Commercial sales of arms from the Untied States to the Republic of China.

**[[China's rise as holographic transition]{.mark}]{.underline}** 4.1
China in the world and the world in China **[[From a
Cartesian]{.mark}/Newtonian ontological standpoint, [it is easier to
understand what 'China in the world' means]{.mark} than to grasp how the
world is also in China.]{.underline}** But it is crucial to understand
the latter equation since otherwise we see only a partial picture of
China's ontological being. [**[China qua China]{.underline}**
**[is]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[always [a dynamic constellation of
relations, and the holographic relational ontology affords us a fresh
perspective on the holographic nature of those relations]{.mark} which
together constitute what we see as 'China's rise' today]{.underline}**.
Indeed, I argue that **[the rise of China is a prime example of how
China is being transformed through its ongoing holographic entanglements
with the world.]{.underline}** To highlight China's contemporary rise as
holographic transition does not mean that China was not a holographic
being before. Rather, **[China's rise represents a significant new phase
of it, which has yet to be more fully examined]{.underline}**. In this
section, I sketch out a first-cut account of China's rise in holographic
terms. **[From the beginning, '[China']{.mark} [may be seen as a
self-conscious holographic project]{.mark}, [modeling itself on
tianxia]{.mark} (All under Heaven). [With that holographic
self-imagination, it was open]{.mark}, for example, [to]{.mark} Buddhist
[influence]{.mark} from India]{.underline}**. Under the rule of the
Mongols, **[China was introduced to Islamic and Persian
medicine]{.underline}**. It is noted that in their study of China,
French scholars started to unravel India and Central Asia (Chandra,
1998), meaning that **[[inside the socalled 'China' there were traces of
Indian and Central Asian cultures]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Tu (1994, 4)
**[[thus likens 'Chinese culture' to 'a majestic flowing
stream']{.underline}]{.mark}**, arguing that many 'great outside
influences altered this stream at various points'. But the terms
'stream' and 'outside influences' still do not go far enough in
conveying the inherently holographic nature of China's being/becoming.
In fact, the term China (**[[Zhongguo]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Chinese)
**[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[largely absent in traditional Chinese
canons]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For example, **[[it exists neither
in]{.mark} the [Confucian]{.mark} classic [text]{.mark} Analects
[nor]{.mark} the [Daoist text]{.mark} Daodejing, [whereas]{.mark} by
contrast the word '[tianxia]{.mark}' [appears 23 and 60 times
respectively]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As Rey Chow (1998, 6) points out,
**[the obsession with China and Chineseness among Chinese intellectuals
was largely a product of recent world history]{.underline}**, **[which
[it]{.mark}self [testifies to China's modern holographic emergence in
the Eurocentric world of nationhood and
nationalism]{.mark}]{.underline}** (see also Zhao, 2005, 8, 13--14).
Given that China has always been a holographic part of its changing
worlds, **[[it is no longer adequate to cast its contemporary rise
merely in terms of change in power balance; it must]{.mark} also [be an
ongoing process of holographic transition]{.mark}, emergence, worlding,
or enfolding]{.underline}**. The existing literature has made much about
a rising China with increasingly global presence (Shambaugh, 2013;
Wortzel, 2013). Yet, the same literature continues to treat China in
'national' terms (for a critique, see Pan, 2014). While China's rise has
no doubt cast a large shadow on the world, its ability to do so is
precisely due, at least in part, to its changes within (Zhang, 1992,
428), many of which reflect the effects of its global connections. That
is, **[[China not only has gone global, but]{.mark} also many [elements
of 'the global' have simultaneously gone inside 'China', thus creating a
further globalized China]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Zweig, 2002; Zhang,
2003; Pan, 2009a; Carlson, 2015). **[In this ongoing process of mutual
implication between 'China' and its multiple worlds, [China is never
confined to, or merely defined by, itself]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In
this sense, Aihwa Ong (2005, 18) is right that 'When a book about China
is only about China, it is suspect'. To understand China entails
considering its global holographic relations. At first sight, the notion
of China as a holographically global state flies in the face of its
reputation as a stubbornly Westphalian state, impervious to (especially
political) change hoped by the West (Mann, 2007). But as noted earlier,
**[[holographic transition is never meant to be]{.mark} mere
[Westernization]{.mark}. [If we look only for rapid change in
China]{.mark} mostly [in our own image, we are likely to overlook or
downplay China's opening up to the wider worlds]{.mark} and to their
goods, resources, capital, science and technology, information, norms,
cultures, fashions, crises, challenges, among other
things]{.underline}**. **[[Emanating from these]{.underline}]{.mark}**
extensive relations **[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** not the
intensification of two-way transactional flows in trade, investment,
people, and ideas between an otherwise static China and the rest of the
world, but **[[a China that has been simultaneously transformed in the
complex images of its multiple worlds]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Such
holographic transition, by no means always positive, can be illustrated
through the holographic nature of the 'Chinese' economy, the 'Chinese'
state, and 'Chinese' society

#### Dialectics inform violence -- Westphalian IR cannot come to a linguistic understanding of Chinese intentions or the capacity to rise -- the discrepancy between commonplace theorization and Qin dialects becomes the justification for interventionism and otherization -- the convert or die mentality is applied to china on a subconscious level and creates forms of internal and external violence

**[A dialectical alternative]{.underline}** Still, a different voice has
emerged recently. It draws on what the author,
**[[Qin]{.underline}]{.mark}** Yaqing, **[[calls Chinese dialectics to
redefine international society]{.underline}]{.mark}**:

> **"[[Society]{.underline}]{.mark}** is not a self-enclosed,
> self-contained entity. Rather, it **[[is]{.mark} a process, [an open
> process of complex social relations in motion]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
> **[[Rules, regimes, and institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}** are not
> established to govern or restrain the behavior of individual actors in
> society, but to **[[harmonize relations among members of
> society.]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[This
> understanding]{.underline}]{.mark}** of society **[[is based upon the
> relational thought process and the complementary
> dialectic]{.underline}]{.mark}**, both of which originate in the
> Chinese philosophical and intellectual traditions. **"**

**[[Because Chinese dialectics 'does not seek
certainty']{.underline}]{.mark}**, Qin explains, **[[it could not
sanction hegemony for China or any other state.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
44 **[[Contra Hegelian/Marxian dialectics, Chinese dialectics 'stresses
change and inclusiveness']{.mark}, [leading to a dynamic co-production
of identity]{.mark} or what Qin calls 'co-thesis or inter-thesis
complementation']{.underline}**.45 From this basis, **[the peacefulness
of China's rise will not depend on China alone]{.underline}**. Nor does
it necessitate conformity or adaptation to the norms, rules, and
practices of today's international society. Rather, international
society reflects 'a complexity of relational networks'; consequently,
the nature of China's rise will involve an 'interaction between China
and international society, the United States, and other members of the
international community'.46 In short, China's rise unfolds in a context.
And it is China's engagement with this context that will shape the
agenda for global politics, not an unchanging set of 'deep and durable
practices' that emanate from a fixed 'international society'. But here
lies the problem. **[[Westphalian IR cannot accommodate Qin's
dialectics, despite its palliative appeal]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
**[[Had Qin embedded his approach in Hegelian
dialectics]{.underline}]{.mark}** or Marxist doctrine, **[[Westphalian
IR could have relegated it]{.mark} [to a]{.mark} well-known, albeit
[dusty, corner of intellectual history]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[But
coming from Chinese dialectics, Qin's approach literally has no referent
in Westphalian IR]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Like a colonial household,
Westphalian IR cannot admit 'unreformed' non-Western Others into the
formal sitting room of IR theory]{.underline}]{.mark}**, to engage in a
discourse among equals, even though nonWestern labour, resources, ideas,
and practices are sneaked in daily through the back door.47 How else
could the House of IR sustain itself ? Equality between the theorists
'upstairs' and the native informants 'downstairs' would 'roil the
waters' of IR's epistemic hierarchy. **[Only the Westphalian Self can
theorise about the rest, not the other way around. [There is no
reciprocity in Westphalian IR.]{.mark} [Westphalian IR thus entrenches
the 'China threat' thesis.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[Not only does it
exclude alternatives, but [Westphalian IR also rationalises the colonial
binary of conversion vs. discipline: convert to be like us or suffer
discipline from us.]{.mark}]{.underline}**48 **[In this way,
[Westphalian IR normalises a condition of constant, mutual
mistrust]{.mark} [and hostility]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Each nationalist
camp expects the other to attack and/or conquer through hard or soft
power. State elites subsequently hinge all negotiations on the
supposedly inviolable signposts of Westphalian IR like sovereignty,
borders, and national security, regardless of any actual collaboration
that takes place on an everyday, concrete basis.49 **[[Both camps
enhance their military capabilities]{.mark} to prepare for worst-case
scenarios. Military [expenditures increase]{.mark}, [along with]{.mark}
predictable socioeconomic [adjustments and sacrifices]{.mark}.
Westphalian IR's eager and intimate partner, [the m]{.mark}ilitary
[i]{.mark}ndustrial [c]{.mark}omplex, [gears up for]{.mark} another
round of mega-million [profits]{.mark} while the rest of us brace for
the future.]{.underline}**50 **[[Violence sets in, both internally and
externally]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[On the Chinese side, the belief
that great power status can remove accusations of a 'China threat'
serves only to underscore the pitfalls of Westphalian
education.]{.underline}** Postcolonial studies fully detail how a former
great power like Britain threatened all it encountered, including its
own populations like the Irish and the Scots, or the working class.51
Why less so the Chinese state?52 **[As for 'rational nationalism', how
does a state manage it without descending into mob rule, jingoism,
and/or demonisation? [History]{.mark} amply [shows the tendency for
nationalism to run amok]{.mark}, especially under conditions of war or
its imminence.]{.underline}**53 And what are the checking mechanisms to
prevent 'superficial enmity' from sliding into 'real enmity'? On the
US/Western side, attempts by the English School to maintain an
international society or liberal world order further affirm the hegemony
of the West and, by extension, Westphalian IR. No one is fooled and many
are angered, leading to alienation, rejection, and worse, reproduction.
As for realists, laments of the 'tragedy' of great power politics have
not deterred them from rationalising power for power's sake at every
turn and to the world's detriment.54 The late Chalmers Johnson cautioned
precisely against such myopia-cum-hubris. With distinguished careers in
government, the military, and academe, particularly regarding the
Asia-Pacific, Johnson was the ultimate establishment 'insider'. Yet in
his last book, The Sorrows of Empire, he warned against an American
'empire of bases' that occupied other peoples' lands and impinged on
their sovereignty. This **[[implicit imperialism]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
Johnson stressed, **[[threatens the]{.mark} very [democracy that the US
claims to represent and seeks to export]{.mark} overseas. 'We had
mounted the Napoleonic tiger',]{.underline}** Johnson wrote in 2004,
shortly after the Bush Administration invaded Iraq. 'The question was,
would we -- and could we -- ever dismount?'55 Sorrows, indeed, flood
this New York Times report from 2008. The reporter recounts what she
observed of US troops in Afghanistan on the ground in their camps:

> **"**'I hate this country!' \[the young sergeant\] shouted. Then he
> smiled and walked back into the hut. 'He's on medication,'
> \[26-year-old Capt. Dan\] Kearney \[commander of the unit\] said
> quietly to me. Then another soldier walked by and shouted, 'Hey, I'm
> with you, sir!' and Kearney said to me, 'Prozac. Serious P.T.S.D. from
> last tour.' Another one popped out of the HQ cursing and muttering.
> 'Medicated,' Kearney said. 'Last tour, if you didn't give him
> information, he'd burn down your house. He killed so many people. He's
> checked out.'56**"**

No less sorrowful are the 'desire industries' that swarm around military
bases, infecting buyers, and sellers alike.57 America's traditional
allies in Asia mentioned by Fargo in his 'rebalancing' strategy --
Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Australia -- have all
served as centres of prostitution for US military bases since World War
II, especially during the Korea and Vietnam Wars. His 'rebalancing'
strategy would not only revitalise these centres but also add new ones
like India, Malaysia, and Singapore to the roster. **[As for the
communities in which military bases are located, rarely do they receive
due compensation for confiscated land or due justice when local women
and girls are raped and assaulted by US military
personnel.]{.underline}**58 Even deviation from the 'China threat'
thesis bears a catch. Those who abide by Westphalian IR but disagree
with the thesis can only do so by denying the problem in the first
place. **[[It is not that the 'China threat' thesis is wrong or
inaccurate; it is that China does not (yet) qualify as a
threat.]{.underline}]{.mark}** One implication, of course, is to keep
China from qualifying. This warrants a whole host of policies and
strategies that either portents violence or induces it.59 Even more, the
analysis begs the question: what should happen when China, eventually,
does qualify as a so-called threat? No stable or safe future can be in
the offing. Significantly, any suggestion of reform or even
introspection within the West must come sotto voce, lest it annoy
Westphalian IR. But what if we were to take Chinese dialectics
seriously?60 How would this approach reconfigure the 'China threat'
thesis? Following, then, is a thought experiment. It applies the root of
'Chinese dialectics' -- that is, Daoist dialectics -- to USChina
relations, specifically, and world politics, generally. What results
from this brief thought experiment is necessarily preliminary but also
instructive. To begin, let us review what is meant by dialectics and the
dao **[Daoist dialectics in IR: reconfiguring the 'China threat'
[Dialectics provide a method of cognition]{.mark} or reasoning
[that]{.mark} systematically [interrogates 'the interrelations among
constituent parts and part-whole relations']{.mark}]{.underline}**.61 No
categorical 'black box' can survive in dialectical thought. All is
subject to examination because all comes from dynamic interactions with
others, whether positive or negative. In IR, according to Shannon
Brincat, '\[d\]ialectics offers \[sic\] **[nothing less than a means to
reframe the social ontology of world politics, from one of alleged
stasis and immutability, to one of process, change and the social
relations that generate them'.]{.underline}**62 Brincat adds:

> **"**What makes social-relational dialectics such a capable method for
> understanding processes is how it informs on particular phenomena
> within the totality of social relations rather than their isolation or
> abstraction . . . \[**[[Dialectics]{.underline}]{.mark}**\]
> **[[provides the contextual analysis of these social relations,
> rendering the interconnetedness between such phenomena and the
> immanent tendencies for social transformation that this
> engenders.]{.underline}]{.mark}**63**"**

Daoist dialectics, however, differ in one key respect: internal
co-implication, or **[[what Qin]{.underline}]{.mark}** Yaqinq
**[[calls]{.underline}]{.mark}** '**[[co-thesis or inter-thesis
complementation]{.underline}]{.mark}**'. **[[Whereas HegelianMarxian
dialectics may posit that polarities]{.mark} -- for example,
'[master']{.mark} [and]{.mark} '[slave']{.mark} -- are mutually created,
[Daoist]{.mark} dialectics [place this co-implication within the
polarities as well: that is, the]{.mark} '[master]{.mark}' [within
the]{.mark} '[slave']{.mark} [and the 'slave' within the
'master']{.mark}]{.underline}**. Change and transformation operate
internally as well as externally, rendering unnecessary, for example, a
forcible synthesis of the polarities through violent revolution.64
Rather, **[[Daoist dialectics teach non-coercive
action]{.underline}]{.mark}** (wuwei) **[[since a natural order of
change operates from within.]{.underline}]{.mark}** To Daoists, a new
regime unfolds naturally and organically to redress the ills of an old
regime, thereby eliminating the need for forcible revolution. (In this
sense, Marx was more Daoist and Mao more Leninist.) In this way, the
Daodejing advises**[[, we arrive at the new with minimal violence to the
old]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Until now, **[despite increasing attention to
relationality]{.underline}** in the social sciences
**[and]{.underline}** emerging interest in **[quantum theory in
IR]{.underline}** (Der Derian, 2013; Wendt, 2015), **[[holographic
relationality remains understudied]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Milovanovic,
2013, 1). Wendt's book (2015) briefly examines the state as a
holographic system. But in his own words, that book 'is all philosophy',
rather than IR (Wendt, 2015, 2). Yet, **[[holographic ontology provides
a new and exciting way of theorizing IR and doing IR
research.]{.mark}]{.underline}** As Wendt and Duvall (1989, 55) note,
**[social ontologies 'have conceptual and methodological consequences
for how theorists approach those phenomena they seek to
explain']{.underline}**. **[[From]{.mark} the [holograph]{.mark}ic
relational ontolog[y]{.mark}, [I draw]{.mark} the following [conceptual
and methodological implications for IR]{.mark} in general and
[for]{.mark} understanding [China]{.mark}'s rise [in
particular]{.mark}.]{.underline}**4 These implications do not amount to
a full-fledged theory on China or IR; rather, they intend to exemplify
some broad promises of 'quantum theory as an interpretive tool for the
social sciences' (Der Derian, 2013, 583n7). In this spirit, I hope
**[[this can help generate further research in this still largely
uncharted terrain.]{.mark}]{.underline}** First of all, **[[to the
extent that i]{.mark}nternational [r]{.mark}elations [contain
parts]{.mark}]{.underline}** (such as states) **[[and
wholes]{.underline}]{.mark}** (such as international society and the
global economy), **[[their relations are
holographic]{.underline}]{.mark}** relations. **[[As such,
states]{.underline}]{.mark}** (or non-state actors for that matter)
**[[are not fixed]{.mark} or essentialist things with their own
intrinsic properties.]{.underline}** **[[We can still talk about states
and their characteristics,]{.mark} [but]{.mark} to make good sense of
them, [we need to look at their holographic roots]{.mark} in their wider
worlds [and understand how such entanglements enable a state to become
'the way it is', not as an essential being, but always as holographic
becoming]{.mark}]{.underline}**. All states necessarily emerge from, and
contain information of, multiple worlds, and in this sense, their
relations are not merely inter-national relations or foreign relations.
With world politics grounding in a holographic ontology, **[[it is
possible and indeed imperative to perceive and practice IR in a more
dynamic, holistic, and cooperative way]{.underline}]{.mark}**. 'Foreign
policy' as a concept, no doubt befitting a Cartesian/Newtonian ontology
of self and Other, may give way to global public policy of empathy and
shared responsibility in dealing with challenges arising from such
holographic relations. **[[Poststructuralist, postcolonial, and feminist
IR literature has usefully deconstructed the essentialist, binary
oppositions]{.underline}]{.mark}** of identity/difference, self/Other,
inside/outside, and West/Rest. **[[But]{.mark} [the holographic ontology
provides a new perspective on why such dichotomies are fundamentally
untenable given their inevitably common holographic
entanglements]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This does not mean that all states
are like-units (Waltz, 1979). The world is not an ideal-type holographic
system within which each part equally shares the same properties of
their holographic whole. Second, insofar as holographic relations in
global politics are constituted largely through informational and
discursive connections, **[[discourse analysis can help trace the
lineage and genealogy of norms and ideas which make global society hang
together]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Thus, in a methodological sense, the
holographic relational ontology has much in common with the
poststructuralist discursive ontology. Yet, while the latter sees things
as constructed by discourse, it says little on the being of discourse
itself. **[The [holograph]{.mark}ic relational
ontolog[y]{.mark}]{.underline}**, on the other hand, **[[treats
discourse as existing in as well as constitutive of holographic
relations]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The holographic relational existence
of discourse, implied in notions such as discursive formation and
intertextuality (Merrell, 1991, 193; Pitts, 1995, 302--303), can explain
why discourse cannot be attributed to a single author and why it (and
its associated power effect) appears at once to be everywhere and
nowhere. Thanks to their holographic ontology, **[discourse and power go
capillary]{.underline}** (Foucault, 1980, 142). Third, given the
existence of holographic relations in both spatial and temporal terms,
**[[understanding a part requires paying attention to both its
holographic relationality in/with the past as well as in the present, so
as to avoid both ahistorical analysis and historicist
determinism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. History is not destiny in that we
are not bound by ancient hatred or have to mechanically repeat
time-honored great power tragedy, but nor is it something which we can
completely transcend (aka the 'End of History'). We are a holographic
part of space and time, our ontological wholes. Jawaharlal Nehru, for
example, knew too well his country's historically situated holographic
'identity':

> **"** \[T\]he history of India is a long history of her relations with
> the other countries of Asia. Streams of culture have come to India
> from the West and the East and been absorbed in India, producing the
> rich and variegated culture which is India today. At the same time,
> streams of culture have flowed from India to distant parts of Asia. If
> you would know India, you have to go to Afghanistan and West Asia, to
> Central Asia, to China and Japan and to the countries of South-East
> Asia (Nehru, 2011, 315). **"**

In short, **[while Cartesian/Newtonian-inspired theorizing favors
'simplifying']{.underline}** (Waltz, 1979, 6), **[holographic ontology
highlights a strong quantum characteristic of complexity, uncertainty,
and indeterminacy about global life]{.underline}**. Instead of a
teleological process of homogenization, holographic transition is more
multifaceted and dynamic. Moreover, **[[scholarly discourses are part
and parcel of holographic relations]{.mark} in IR, and [rather than
merely a neutral analytic tool]{.mark} independent of the world they
describe, they are an inherently participatory factor in how holographic
relations take shape and evolve]{.underline}**. Consequently,
holographic reality is necessarily protean and complex, and our
theorizing effort ought to reflect it accordingly.

#### In the face of a binaristic world structured by international relations the aff's imagination becomes an organizing point for discourse that escalates to a dissolution of Westphalia.

4 **[Advaitic-daoist IR: a pool of multiple worlds]{.underline}** With
water as metaphor, **[[world politics becomes a pool of fluid, multiple
worlds]{.underline}]{.mark}**.23 **[[Each world represents a node of
epistemes that ripples outward, melting at the edges with other
concentric spills of epistemes.]{.mark}]{.underline}** These circulate
communal modes of thinking and doing, being and relating that have
evolved over millennia. **[Like water, multiple worlds must flow freely
to stay vibrant; [in IR terms, this means interacting with Difference
and hybridizing with Others]{.mark}]{.underline}**.24 Nonetheless,
**[the nodes run deep: that is, multiple worlds do not lose their
distinctive characteristics]{.underline}**. These reflect and sustain
legacies of history and tradition, sentiment and practice transmitted
through language, memory, storytelling, and rituals. Indeed, in every
ancient civilization, myth accounts for the origin of these nodes. Like
raindrops from Heaven, they simply descend upon the pool one day. At the
same time, these nodes do not stay the same forever. **[Past currents
fill the present as much as present circulations wash the
past]{.underline}**. Our brief excursion into darsana, dharma, and
ayurveda indicates a sense of how epistemic border-crossings effect
transformations both communally and individually. **[[In this pool of
multiple worlds, 'China' qualifies as one node among
many]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Its size and weight may affect the current
more than most but all nodes, no matter how big or small, form
concentric circles that ripple outward to merge with others, no matter
how far or near. As mentioned, the pool's water comes from and reflects
systemic dynamics beyond the pool: e.g., the sky and other environmental
elements (like climate change) that could disturb the pool's
tranquility; ripples that evaporate over time (like stories and
memories, prayers and traditions) only to return as new raindrops (like
innovations, trends, and revolutionary developments); and other,
unforeseen events (like inter-galactic contact). Sameness (globalities)
and difference (localities) thus co-exist, copenetrate, and co-produce.
**[[The very multiplicity of nodes, ripples, and circulations in the
pool of multiple worlds ensures a mutual balancing that evens the
flow]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- if left alone as wuwei advises. With
dynamic forces at play, water can stay fresh and vital; otherwise,
stagnant water like epistemic violence/epistemicide can spread
life-threatening disease (e.g., ecological disaster, economic
depression, ceaseless warfare) through mosquitoes (e.g., corrupt
bureaucracies, predatory capitalism) or some other vermin. Still, one
centripetal force applies: the heart. How else could we awaken wisdom
and enact selfless compassion? In Chinese medicine (zhongyi), the heart
organ 'rules' the body25; in ayurveda, as noted, the heart chakra alone
connects the lower three vortices of physical health with the upper
three of spiritual well-being. The entire system hinges on the heart.
The critical reader may interject: Where lies the heart or spirituality
in water? Here, I return to Laozi's respect for water. **[Daoism treats
[water]{.mark} as if it [has volition]{.mark}]{.underline}**. That is,
**[[water's transformative qualities]{.underline}]{.mark}** ('meekest in
the world'/'strongest in the world') **[[come from an inherent integrity
and agency]{.underline}]{.mark}** ('benefits everything', 'dwell in
places loathed by the crowd'). For this reason, water not only reflects
but also enables the dao. Like the human body, **[[our world-of-worlds
encases a multitude of life-forces operating in dynamic
tension]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The deepest, most concrete chakras of
safety, sexuality, and nourishment can rise to the higher, more abstract
ones of creativity, intuition, and cosmic consciousness, just as the
upper chakras can reach down into the lower ones. Indeed, if the
principle of wuwei presides, **[[each]{.underline}]{.mark}** chakra
**[[flows naturally and organically into the other, stabilizing and
strengthening the whole.]{.mark}]{.underline}** What does this mean in
terms of real-world policies and strategies? Let us consider the
implications of daoist water, ayurvedic chakras, yin/ yang trialectics,
advaita connectedness, and Buddhist duality with nonduality for
understanding 'China's rise'. 4.1 **[[China's rise
re-appraised]{.mark}]{.underline}** As a thought experiment, let us
designate 'China' as yin and the 'West' as yang. (The specific
designation doesn't matter since the process remains the same.) **[[With
daoist water as metaphor, we see that the initial dichotomy of 'China'
and the 'West' as two fixed binaries cannot hold]{.underline}]{.mark}**;
instead, each principal flows into the other in all ways and at all
levels, ranging from the 'micro' to the 'macro'. **[[A trialectical
effect takes place, highlighting a heterotopic-third domain that
connects the principals while creating a new
hybrid.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Zen Buddhism's five-rank protocol shows
how: 1. The first two ranks recognize that **[[a China-yin exists within
a West-yang]{.mark} [as much as a West-yang exists in a
China-yin.]{.mark} One prominent example comes from immigrant
communities in both places.]{.underline}** For now, let us date these to
the 19th-century: say, the Chinese diaspora in the West and Western
missionaries/merchants/expatriates in China. Each group may not only
assimilate into its new environment but both also retain their
distinctive features. **[Here, [we begin to break down the nationalistic
confines of the Westphalian state]{.mark} [to recognize the
transnational communities that make world
politics]{.mark}.]{.underline}** These include neighboring sites like
Southeast Asia that also have a longstanding Chinese diaspora and,
similarly, British colonial 'ex-pats' in South and Southeast Asia. In
this way, we unlock the Westphalian trap of prioritizing powerful 'Great
Gamers' to the exclusion and at the expense of the rest of the planet.
Breaking this colonial bondage enables us to pay attention to crucial
connections with and across the global South. 'Epistemic violence' and
'epistemicide' begin to dissipate. 2. The third rank posits that the two
principals, **[[China-yin and West-yang, can come together.
Communication becomes key]{.mark}. [Not only would the two communities
have the most at stake to engage with each other directly but also with
compassion]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Elsewhere (Ling and Pinheiro,
forthcoming), **[[we develop a model of dialogue called Creative
Listening and Speaking]{.underline}]{.mark}** (CLS). **[[It mandates
listening with the courage to speak and speaking with the humility to
listen; otherwise, neither listening nor speaking alone could dismantle
hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Again, commonalities surge forward,
transforming pre-existing conflicts and contradictions into a
trialectical heterotopia.26 3. **[The fourth rank urges action based on
this insight. [We do not need to list here specific policies and/or
strategies]{.mark}. [The two principals' internal
entwinements]{.mark}]{.underline}** (yin-within-yang, yang-within-yin)
**[[can guide action based on the imaginations and interests of the
communities themselves and in their own context rather than anything an
outsider or lofty principles could provide]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The
fourth rank underscores, also, the value and relevance of these
transnational communities for the state. They have the
**[[expertise]{.mark} in language, cultural knowledge, and assimilative
experiences [to help the state transcend hackneyed dichotomies like
'China' versus the 'West'.]{.mark}]{.underline}** 4. The fifth rank
affirms 'unity attained'. Perhaps a ceremonious event may suffice but it
performs a necessary function to declare 'there is no more duality'. The
event, moreover, will need to resonate contextually to attain its full
meaning; otherwise, community members will (rightfully) regard it as a
cynical move to mask hegemony in 'friendlier, gentler' guise.27
**[[Water as metaphor offers innovative strategies for inter-state
conflict]{.mark} as well]{.underline}**. For instance, an ayurvedic lens
on China's regional conflicts would attribute these to a fixation with
the lower chakras only, thereby forcing hostilities due to a classic
(in)security dilemma. **[[Each state seeks to protect or enhance its own
security (safety) by making hypermasculine-militaristic poses
(sexuality) that spiral everyone's sense of
insecurity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Meanwhile, the population's ability
to feed itself (nourishment) suffers, as national security consumes more
and more resources, even as the state claims to protect all aspects of
the supposed 'heartland'. However, the upper chakras can guide the lower
ones to reach a healthier, happier, more sustainable outcome. The fifth
chakra of creativity, for example, could inspire use of the arts and
humanities to broaden, not to mention deepen, sovereign relations among
peoples in both states (Ling and Nakamura, 2017). The governments and
societies of China and Japan could re-appreciate what each has meant to
the other from ancient times to 'catch-up' modernity (Ling, 2016b). With
two millennia of history together, China and Japan cannot -- should not
-- risk everything on the past 200 years. **[[The region, furthermore,
abounds with strategies for conflict resolution that pre-date
Westphalia]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Chong, 2012). **[[Why not draw on
these precedents?]{.mark}]{.underline}** The highest chakras help these
strategies reach fruition. With intuition and cosmic consciousness, we
gain a sense of 'awakened wisdom and selfless compassion'. **[[We have a
reason, method, and ideal to dissolve Westphalia's deadly deadlock of
narrow, nationalistic interests set in immutable, binary
oppositions]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[From this basis, world politics
no longer divides into Self-aggrandizing, hypermasculinized 'Great
Gamers' versus invisibilized, feminized 'small fry'. From 'epistemic
violence' and/or 'epistemicide']{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[world
politics can embark, instead, on engagement, learning, and mutuality:
that is, Interbeing.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[China's rise: implications for IR]{.underline}** Today's China still
disturbs. It may no longer sponsor anti-Western revolution at home or
abroad, and has transformed, instead, into a bastion of neoliberal
capitalism for almost forty years. **[But [the People's Republic still
unsettles the West]{.mark} mainly [due to its integration, or lack
thereof, into the 'international community']{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Economist, 25 January 2018). What exactly, many worry, is or will be
China's role in world politics? **[[To Liberal
Westphalians]{.underline}]{.mark}** like Barry Buzan (2010) and G. John
Ikenberry (2011), **[a [rising China could destabilize]{.mark} or
consolidate the status quo, depending on the willingness of leaders in
Beijing to cooperate with the Western-led, liberal world order -- and
how much the West can insist on or entice such
cooperation.]{.underline}** To Chinese Westphalians like Yan Xuetong
(2011), China will invariably alter the status quo regardless of
leadership inclinations. The country's demographic and territorial size,
not to mention its historical import, will make a difference. Another
source of convergence comes from Classical Westphalians and Chinese
Constructivists. The former, like Henry Kissinger (2011), propose that
China and the West should just get together, like the Pope and the Kings
of Europe did in the 16th-century. They divided the world among
themselves, then ruled accordingly. Stability and order ensued -- at
least for the principals involved. (That such comity initiated five
centuries of violence and brutality against those not privy to the
bargain seems to have escaped Classical Westphalians -- or they don't
care.) Chinese Constructivists like Qin Yaqing (2010, 2011, 2016) and
other members of the 'Chinese School of IR' (Zhang and Chang 2016) make
a slightly different argument. Chinese norms and values, they believe,
will naturally interact with the world to effect changes that remain, as
yet, unanticipated. Together with the West, Qin suggests, China will
form a new global order. 2.1 Critique **[[Neither camp questions
categories]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[like 'China', the 'West', the
'interstate system', or even the 'Westphalian state']{.mark}. [All
presume that states will remain the central unit of IR analysis,
functioning as self-enclosed, self-interested units of
power]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Even Qin Yaqing imposes a
statist--nationalist frame onto a philosophical and normative tradition
-- yin/yang dynamics -- that had no such intention or purpose in the
first place.6 Despite the systemic dynamics that he himself has
introduced, **[[anything outside the China/West matrix remains an
afterthought or a playground for the powerful]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Yan Xuetong puts it more directly: so far, only 'small fry' like Vietnam
and the Philippines have complained about China's moves in the South
China Sea -- meaning there is no "real" opposition from a major power
like the United States, Europe, or Russia (Huang, 2016). So China has
nothing to worry about. (He conveniently omits China's standoff with
Japan in the East China Sea.) Both camps also unite in their patriarchal
proclivities (Ling, 2016c). **[Whether it's Brotherly Love under
Confucian tianxia]{.underline}** (All-underHeaven) **[or a more perfect,
machine-like Artificial Man in Hobbes' Leviathan, the Chinese School and
their Westphalian counterparts partake in what is effectively a
gentleman's club.]{.underline}** Some, like the English school, may
appear in top hat and morning coat; others, like the Chinese school, may
dress in changpao magua. 7 But all revel in a common, hypermasculine
camaraderie: that is, they regale one another with clever chatter or
perhaps a zinger or two while being served, silently and efficiently, by
those whom they will never know or even acknowledge but whose labor and
resources make their 'club' possible in the first place. **[[Not
surprisingly, these hypermasculine theorists discount anything smacking
of the non-masculine]{.underline}]{.mark}** (e.g.,
postcolonial-feminism), **[[non-heteronormative]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(e.g., **[[queer theory]{.underline}]{.mark}**), **[[and especially
non-secular]{.mark}]{.underline}** (e.g., '**[[gods and
spirits']{.underline}]{.mark}**).8 **[[There is no room in the IR club
for such 'distractions'.]{.mark} [Herein lies the nub of Self-delusion
in Westphalian IR.]{.mark} [History has shown]{.mark}, time and again,
[that society's so-called 'servile' and 'inferior' classes can make new
worlds despite generations of racism--sexism--imperialism entrenched by
hierarchy and privilege,]{.mark} colonialism and
imperialism]{.underline}** (Kataneksza et al., 2018). As Andean activist
Humberto **[[Cholango declared to Pope Benedict XVI in a letter in

people\] **[[are still here']{.underline}]{.mark}** (Cholango quoted in
Cadena, 2010, p. 335). **[[Despite centuries of
control]{.underline}]{.mark}**, if not genocide, the people of **[[the
Andes -- like other feminized, colonized subjects throughout the globe
-- have survived and they did so by 'learn\[ing\] how to merge our
beliefs and symbols with the ones of the invaders and
oppressors']{.underline}]{.mark}** (Cholango quoted in Cadena, 2010, p.
334). Such is epistemic compassion.9 **[I [turn]{.mark} now [to advaita

trialectics]{.underline}]{.mark}**: **[[connectedness and
compassion]{.mark}]{.underline}** 3.1 **[Advaita monism]{.underline}**
Most cite Shankara (c. 8th century BCE) for articulating advaita. It
relates to but differs from two other branches of the subcontinent's
vedas ('knowledge'): dvaita (dualism) and vishishtadvaita (qualified
monism or holism).the **[[The concept of Advaita]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(literally meaning non-dual or nonsecondness) **[[pre-supposes a monist
epistemology that]{.underline}]{.mark}**\...**[[ties
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** perceiver
(**[[subject]{.underline}]{.mark}**) **[[and the]{.underline}]{.mark}**
perceived (**[[object]{.underline}]{.mark}**) **[[together with a
globe]{.mark}]{.underline}** marked with 'single hidden connectedness'
or Brahman (Shahi and Ascione, 2015, p. 2). From this basis, Shahi and
Ascione construct **[[an advaitic-monist model]{.mark}]{.underline}** of
world politics. It **[[suggests an 'ever-transient' but 'perpetually
connected' global system]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Shahi and Ascione,
2015, p. 15). Just as 'theorist' and 'theory' fuse into an ultimate
reality encompassed by Brahma so, too, **[advaitic-monist IR would
highlight 'an unbreakable and irreversible "micro--macro linkage" or
ontological nexus between diverse individuals, nation-states and the
world.]{.underline}**..' (Shahi and Ascione, 2015, p. 15). They
conclude: The intellectual realization of 'connectedness' can make a
powerful case for reinterpreting diversities in political identities,
thereby creating new ethical space for condemning divisive domestic,
international and global politics (Shahi and Ascione, 2015, p. 15). I
applaud this articulation of an advaitic-monist IR. **[[It brings us
closer to a world politics beyond Westphalia. Dichotomies like 'China'
versus the 'West' begin to dissolve.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Advaita
monism's dynamic, perpetual connectedness alerts us to the ties that
bind even when conflicts and contradictions seem to pull us apart.
Accordingly, **[[our analysis of China and the West cannot abide by IR
conventions]{.mark} like the three 'levels of analysis']{.underline}**
(Waltz, 1954) **[or 'structure versus units']{.underline}** (Waltz,
1979). We need to consider how all the 'constituents of the globe'
(Shahi and Ascione, 2015, p. 15) interrelate and interact. Even if
national governments may quarrel, various actors
('individuals,\...classes, communities, cultures, peoples') as well as
the context in which they operate ('ecology and the world') still have a
mediating impact, 'reveal\[ing\] the hidden connectedness across
diversities' (Shahi and Ascione, 2015, p. 15). Yet, **[[this
intellectual and heuristic agenda]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as Shahi and
Ascione (2015, p. 15) underscore, **[[remains an 'unrealized
intellectual quest'. It compels further
exploration]{.underline}]{.mark}**. I could not agree more. Nonetheless,
I raise a cautionary note. We need to resist falling into the Cartesian
trap of highlighting advaita monism in contradistinction to its two
partners in philosophy: dvaita dualism and vishishtadvaita holism.
Analytically, each branch of thought could not be without the others.
Note, for example, how people live their lives, demonstrating the
fluidity between these categories fixed by Western social science. I
focus on three cases, in particular: darsana, 10 dharma, 11 and
ayurveda.12 The first two show how advaita--dvaita--vishishtadvaita
cross epistemic borders between the divine and the mundane; the last,
the body and the mind. All three link the individual with the community,
the environment with the cosmopolitical. **[These underscore humanity's
undeniable thirst for spirituality, not just ethics. [Epistemic
compassion thus takes place]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

## 2ac ---Specific Ks

### 2ac -- Anti-Blackness

#### The kritik has the wrong starting point because it focuses solely on the social relations which uphold antiblackness without interrogating what produces those relations in the first place -- antiblackness is reified by the actions of bodies who affectively invest in racial signifiers which they uphold. The impact is ontological gridlock. That limits the radical possibilities of becomings for the black identity and encases it within a structural container -- this is our definition of how violence happens along the Westphalian hierarchy.

**[[might]{.underline}]{.mark}** such a thinking **[[transform]{.mark}
our understanding of [the relation of blackness to history and
its]{.mark} specific [capacity to "think \[its\] way out of the
exclusionary constructions" of history]{.mark}]{.underline}** and the
thinking of history (Moten 2008a: 1744)? **[[Existing ontologies]{.mark}
tend to [reduce blackness to a historical
condition]{.mark},]{.underline}** **[a "lived experience," [and]{.mark}
in doing so effectively [eradicate its unruly character]{.mark} as a
transformative force.]{.underline}** **[Deleuze and
Guattari]{.underline}**, I think, offer a compelling way to
**[think]{.underline}** of **[this unruliness]{.underline}** when they
write, "**[What [History grasps]{.mark} of the event is]{.underline}**
its effectuation in states of affairs or in **[[lived experience, but
the event in its becoming]{.mark}, in its specific
consistency]{.underline}**, in its self- positing as concept,
**[[escapes History]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (Deleuze and Guattari 1994:
110). **[[To bring this relation]{.mark} between blackness and
becoming]{.underline}** further into the open **[--- [toward]{.mark} an
[affirmation]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[of the
unexpected]{.underline}**]{.mark} insinuation of blackness signaled by
the use of Jackson's line as an "**[event in its
becoming]{.underline}**" --- a few more words need be said about
Deleuze's method. The use of Jackson's writing is just one instance of a
procedure that we find repeated throughout Capitalism and Schizophrenia,
where **[we constantly encounter unexpected injections of]{.underline}**
quotations, names, and **[ideas]{.underline}** lifted from other texts,
**[lines that appear all of sudden as though propelled by their own
force.]{.underline}** One might say they are deployed rather than
explained or interpreted; as such, they produce textual events that
readers may choose to ignore or pick up and run with. **[Many
names]{.underline}** are proposed for this method ---
"**[schizoanalysis]{.underline}**, **[micropolitics]{.underline}**,
**[pragmatics]{.underline}**, diagrammatism,
**[rhizomatics]{.underline}**, **[cartography]{.underline}**" (Deleuze
and Parnet \[1977\] 2006: 94) --- **[but the crucial issue is to [affirm
an experimental practice that opposes itself to]{.mark} the
[interpretation]{.mark}]{.underline}** of texts, **[proposing
[instead]{.mark} that [we think of]{.mark}]{.underline}** a book as "a
little machine" and ask "**[[what it functions
with]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in connection with what other things does
it **[[or does it not transmit intensities?"]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(Deleuze and Guattari \[1980\] 1987: 4).8 Studying how Soledad Brother
functions in Deleuze's books, connecting Jackson's line to questions and
historical issues that are not always explicitly addressed in those
books, involves one in this action. And further, it opens new lines
where the intensities transmitted in Jackson's book make a claim on our
own practice. **[This method can be seen as an effort to disrupt the
hierarchical opposition between theory and practice]{.underline}** and
to challenge some of the major assumptions of Western Marxism. In an
interview with Antonio Negri in the 1990s, Deleuze (1997: 171) clarifies
that he and Guattari have "remained Marxists" in their concern **[to
analyze the ways capitalism has developed]{.underline}** but that their
political philosophy **[makes three crucial distinctions
with]{.underline}** respect to more **[traditional theoretical
approaches]{.underline}**: first, a thinking of "war machines" as
opposed to state theory; second, **[a "consideration of minorities
rather than classes"]{.underline}**; and finally, **[the study of social
"lines of flight" rather than the interpretation and critique of social
contradictions]{.underline}**. Each of these distinctions, as we will
see, resonates with Jackson's political philosophy, but as the passage
from Anti-Oedipus demonstrates, the concept of **[the "line of flight"
emerges directly in connection]{.underline}** to Deleuze and Guattari's
encounter **[with Soledad Brother]{.underline}**. **[[The concept
affirms]{.mark} those [social constructions]{.mark} that would
[neither]{.mark} be [determined by preexisting structures nor caught
in]{.mark} a [dialectical contradiction. It names a force]{.mark} that
is [radically autonomous from existing ontologies,]{.mark} structures,
and historical accounts]{.underline}**. **[It is]{.underline}** above
all **[for this reason]{.underline}** that **[D]{.underline}**eleuze
**[and G]{.underline}**uattari **[insist that [society]{.mark} be
[thought of not as]{.mark} a "[structure" but as]{.mark} a
"[machine,"]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[because such a concept enables
the thinking of]{.mark} the [movements]{.mark}, energies, [and
intensities]{.mark}]{.underline}** (i.e., **[the lines of flight) [that
such machines transmit. The thinking]{.mark} of machines [forces
us]{.mark} not only [to consider]{.mark} the social and historical labor
involved in producing society but also the [ongoing potentials of
constructing new]{.mark} types of [assemblages]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(agencement). **[[One of the key adversaries]{.mark} of this machinic
approach [is]{.mark}]{.underline}** "interpretation" and more
specifically **[structuralist interpretations of society [in terms of
contradictions]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} According to Deleuze and
Guattari (\[1980\] 1987: 293), **[[structuralism]{.mark} persisted in
the "submission of the line to the point" and as a result [produced a
theory of subjectivity, and]{.mark} also an account of [language]{.mark}
and the unconscious, [that could not think in]{.mark} terms of [movement
and construction]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[[Defining lines
only in relation to finite points]{.underline}]{.mark}** (the subject,
the signifier) **[[produces a calculable grid]{.mark},]{.underline}** a
structure that then appears as the hidden intelligibility of the system
and of society generally. Louis Althusser's account of the "ideological
State apparatus" as the **[[determining structure]{.mark} of
subjectivity [is]{.mark}]{.underline}** perhaps **[[the
extreme]{.underline}]{.mark}** expression of this **[[gridlocked
position]{.underline}]{.mark}** (an example we will come back to in a
later section). **[Opposed to this theoretical approach,
[diagrammatism]{.mark}]{.underline}** (to invoke one of the terms given
for this method) **[maps vectors that generate an open space and the
potentials]{.underline}** for giving consistency to the latter.9 In
other words, **[rather than tracing the hidden structures of an
intolerable system, D]{.underline}**eleuze **[and
G]{.underline}**uattari**['s method aims to map the ways out of
it.]{.underline}**

#### Specifically, the perm is black becoming. The cultural production of slavery is creolized, already rhizomatic. They uphold the West which bases itself upon an ontology of sameness, making racialized violence inevitable. Nomadic subjectivity shatters that dynamic. Further it's a modality through which non-black individuals can become not anti-black.

Rhizomic politics A multiply located, non-unitary subject position
**[and a rhizomic politics of relations is]{.underline}** also
**[recommended by]{.underline}** the Deleuzian philosopher **[Edouard
Glissant. He develops an effective rhizomatic poetics and
politics]{.underline}**, **[taking as his point of reference the
historical experience]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** the
**[specific location of Africans and West Indians caught in the
transatlantic slave trade]{.underline}**. **[Glissant foregrounds the
importance of memory and the productivity of mixity as the centrepieces
of his theory of Relation]{.underline}**. **[He argues that [even an
experience as devastating as slavery produces specific forms of
knowledge and subjectivization that transcend the burden of the
negative.]{.mark} The]{.underline}**re are several **[important
feature]{.underline}**s at stake in Glissant\'s remarkable position; the
first **[is the]{.underline}** **[primacy of the Relation]{.underline}**
over any of its terms, **[including the negative ones]{.underline}**.
**[A relation functions through the middle, the
\'milieu\']{.underline}** (more on this in the next chapter). **[People
who are]{.underline}** culturally and ethnically **[positioned in the
middle - like the Caribbeans or West Indians]{.underline}** - **[have a
head start in understanding the crucial importance of the
relation]{.underline}**. **[[They also have]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
however, **[[a historical legacy of destruction and violence]{.mark},
[which is hard to transcend]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[in that it
includes]{.mark} both [the erasure of]{.mark} the [original culture
and]{.mark} the [forceful absorption of the colonizing
culture.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[In response to
this]{.mark}]{.underline}** ethical and political **[challenge,
[Glissant actively theorizes]{.mark} the [becoming-minoritarian or
becoming-rhizomatic of blacks]{.mark}, Creoles, descendants of slaves
and colonized peoples]{.underline}**. **[This is described as [a
spiritual]{.mark} but also logistical [shift in the structure of the
subject in the direction of openness towards both self and
other.]{.mark} [Glissant\'s position includes a]{.mark} sharp [critique
of the West]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[which is based on the ontology
of Sameness]{.underline}]{.mark}** or **[the rule of One.]{.underline}**
This includes a dualistic relationship to the rest of the human race.
There exists a dominant mode of nomadism in Western culture - in the
form of epic journeys of discovery, which find their historical apogee
in colonialism. **[The power of Sameness]{.underline}** **[in the west
is best described in terms of monolinguism, or [the illusion of a single
cultural and linguistic root]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.
**[Glissant]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[,]{.underline}** in a very
Deleuzian mode, **[[plays the rhizome]{.mark} [against the root]{.mark}
and advocates global polylinguism]{.underline}**. This includes **[the
deconstruction of the hubris of European master cultures and the
arrogance with which they consider their languages as the voice of
humanity]{.underline}**. **[[This universalistic pretence is]{.mark}
[one of the mechanisms supporting colonialism]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
**[It also entails the reappraisal of minor languages,]{.underline}**
dialects and hybrids, in a phenomenon that Glissant describes as
**[creolization: [\'Poets from the Caribbean, the Maghreb and]{.mark}
[other parts of Africa are not moving toward that elsewhere]{.mark} that
is the aim of projectile movement, nor are they returning toward a
Centre. [They create]{.mark} [their works in metropolitan
regions,]{.mark} [where their peoples have made a sudden
appearance\']{.mark}]{.underline}** (Glissant 1997: 31). **[Glissant
offers a striking example of the poetics of relation in his analysis
of]{.underline}** **[how, [in]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[the Caribbean
colonized territories]{.underline}**]{.mark}, **[[the French
colons]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[spoke their own homegrown
dialects]{.underline}]{.mark}** - Norman or Breton - **[[rather
than]{.mark} the high and noble language [of the]{.mark} [French
nation]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[It]{.underline}** **[is [this
bastardized language that mingles with that of the local
population]{.mark}, [creating a crossover]{.mark} between two distinct
but analogous forms of linguistic non-purity]{.underline}**.
Creolization, therefore, cuts both ways and it differs from the master
langue in its very structures. The thought of relation as a form of
philosophical nomadism stresses the importance of the middle, in this
mode of non-origin, non-purity and not-Oneness. Glissant defines this
productive multiplicity as \'echoes of the world\' - modes of resonance
of the great vitality of human biodiversity at both the biological and
the cultural level. **[They reconnect us to [the living chaos of the
world]{.mark} as living matter [in
transformation]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[a hybrid, dynamic resilient
bios/zoe force of [global creolization]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}
**[[Glissant captures this]{.mark} vitality and [honours it as a
poetics]{.mark} or [an ethics of rhizomatic
interconnections.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Contrary to what some
ungenerous critics suggested (Gedalof 1996, 2000; Boer 1996; Felski
1997; Pels 1999), **[[my nomadic subject pursues the same]{.mark}
[critique of power]{.mark} [as black and post-colonial
theories]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[not in spite but because of the
fact that it is located somewhere else.]{.mark} Philosophical nomadism
addresses]{.underline}** in both a critical and creative manner t**[he
role of the former \'centre\' in redefining power relations. [Margins
and centre shift and destabilize each other]{.mark} in parallel, albeit
dissymmetrical, movements.]{.underline}** **[My position
is]{.underline}** equally **[[resistant to]{.mark} the [identification
of the centre as]{.mark} [inertia and]{.mark} self-perpetuation and to
the aporetic [repetition of Sameness]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[The
challenge is to destabilize]{.mark} dogmatic, [hegemonic,]{.mark}
exclusionary [power structures at the very heart of the identity
structures of the dominant subject through rhizomic
interventions]{.mark}.]{.underline}** If we are to move beyond the
sociology of travel and the breast-beating of critical thinkers crushed
by white guilt, **[[we need]{.mark} to enact a vision of the subject
that encompasses [changes in the deep structures]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
The point is not just mere deconstruction, but the relocation of
identities on new grounds that account for multiple belongings, i.e. a
non-unitary vision of a subject. This subject actively yearns for and
constructs itself in complex and internally contradictory social
relations. **[To account for these [we need to look at the internal
forms of movement that privilege processes rather
than]{.mark}]{.underline}** essences and transformations, rather than
**[[counter-claims to identity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
**[sociological variables]{.underline}** (**[gender, class,
race]{.underline}** and ethnicity, age, health) **[need to be
supplemented by a theory of the subject that calls into question the
inner fibres of the self.]{.underline}** **[These include the desire,
the ability and the courage to sustain multiple belongings in a context
which celebrates and rewards Sameness and one-way
thinking]{.underline}**. In chapters 4 and 51 will address this
challenge further, which is an ethical as well as a political
enterprise. It is my contribution, as a European nomadic subject moving
across the variegated landscape of whiteness, to a debate which black,
anti-racist, post-colonial and other critical thinkers have put on the
map.

#### Here's a psychoanalytic justification for our theory of race as a product of affective investment in certain signifiers. 

**Seshadri-Crooks 2K** (Kalpana, Professor of English at Boston College,
"Desiring Whiteness: A Lacanian Analysis of Race", Routledge Press 2000)

-if race only pertained to the imaginary, then it would have nothing to
do with the symbolic.

-anti-blackness doesn't structure the symbolic; the symbolic structures
anti-blackness.

Racial identification and imaginary ideology

I emphasise the register of **[the symbolic order]{.underline}** because
**[we must never lose sight of it,]{.underline}** although it is most
frequently forgotten, **[although we turn away from it in
analysis]{.underline}**. Because, in the end, what do we usually talk
about? What we go on and on about, often in a confused, scarcely
articulated fashion, are the subject's imaginary relations to the
construction of his ego. We talk all the time about the dangers, the
commotions, the crises that the subject undergoes at the level of his
ego's construction. That is why I started by explaining the relation
O-Ó, the imaginary relation to the other. (I: 179) It is commonplace to
utilize Lacan's early essay on the mirror stage to analyze
identification as a function of ideology. **[Althusser]{.underline}**'s
much cited essay "Ideology and ideological state apparatuses" (1972),
through its allusions to Lacan, **[construes ideology as a form of
specularity]{.underline}** **[whereby the subject]{.underline}** (with a
small **[s) is subjected to the capitalized Subject in a relation of
mutual recognition]{.underline}**. **[Althusser maps this
"mirror-structure of ideology"]{.underline}** (1972:180) on a dual
plane, **[and suggests that such "duplication" constitutes the
méconnaissance that guarantees the hegemony of the ruling
classes.]{.underline}** Such an appropriation of Lacan's mirror stage
could potentially be extended to resolve the conundrum of race as a
(scientifically groundless) fraught looking. Insofar as racial
differences are understood as being inscribed on the body as skin color,
hair texture and bone structure, it seems inescapable that we should
analyze race within the paradigm of identification. In fact, Lacan's
emphasis on misrecognition as constitutive of the child's nascent ego as
a "little other" seems to lend itself to the constructionist view of
race as a "mistake" of or in the looking glass.11 **[This is a powerful
method of reading, and [Fanon is]{.mark}]{.underline}** perhaps **[the
[exemplar of such a deployment of Lacan for
race]{.mark}]{.underline}**.12 **[[In]{.underline}]{.mark}** a long
footnote in **[[Black Skin, White Masks, he speaks of racial
identification]{.mark} as it occurs in white and black children: It
would]{.underline}** indeed **[be interesting, [on the basis of
Lacan's]{.mark} theory of the [mirror period,]{.mark} to investigate the
extent to which the imago of his]{.underline}** **[fellow built up in
the young white]{.underline}** at the usual age **[would undergo an
imaginary aggression with the appearance of the Negro]{.underline}**.
**[When one has grasped the mechanism described by Lacan]{.underline}**,
**[one can have no further doubt that the real Other]{.underline}**
**[for the white man is]{.underline}** and will continue to be **[the
black man]{.underline}**. **[The Other is perceived on the level of the
body image]{.underline}**, absolutely as the not-self---that is, **[the
unidentifiable, the unassimilable]{.underline}**.
(**[Fanon]{.underline}** 1967:161) **[Just as the white child constructs
its ego]{.underline}** ideal **[on the basis of an
exclusion]{.underline}**, the child in the Antilles, who looks in the
mirror, also excludes its own color. **[[Fanon
contends]{.mark}]{.underline}** that **[when Antilleans are asked to
recall their mirror image, "invariably they reply: 'I had no
color'"]{.underline}** (1967:162). **["In the Antilles perception always
occurs on the level of the imaginary. [It is in white terms that one
perceives one's fellows]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (163). Further, "the
Antillean does not think of himself as a black man; he thinks of himself
as an Antillean" (148). **[[For Fanon,]{.mark} the [blackness]{.mark} of
the Negro's body [is a brute fact]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[and must
found]{.mark} the subject's [identification]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
not be displaced by identification with nation or ethnicity. **[Such
misplaced identification for Fanon]{.underline}** (he terms it **[the
"mirror hallucination]{.underline}**") **[is caused by the ideological
power of]{.underline}** French cultural **[imperialism]{.underline}**.
**[Ideology then pertains to the positioning of
blackness:]{.underline}** **[for the black child, disavowal---the
inability to accept its own blackness]{.underline}**, **[and for the
white child]{.underline}**, **[phobia]{.underline}**---**[the inability
to introject the other's image.]{.underline}** **[[The above analysis of
race]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[based]{.underline}** as it is **[on a
simple reading of the mirror stage, [discloses several fundamental
problems]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the common-sense attitude towards
racial practice. **[[1 If we reduce racial practice to
racism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[defined as power's agency to
hierarchize and discriminate]{.underline}**, **[[we must accept race as
an a priori fact]{.mark} of human difference]{.underline}**. The concept
of **[race as a system that fixates on arbitrary marks on the body
becomes neutralized,]{.underline}** **[and racism becomes the
enemy]{.underline}**. In other words, **[there is no possibility of
interrogating the structure and constitution of the subject of
race.]{.underline}** **[The question ["How]{.mark} do [we become white,
black]{.mark}, brown, or [yellow]{.mark}?"]{.underline}** **[[will be
foreclosed]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[[We]{.underline}]{.mark}** will
**[[fail to discern racial practice]{.mark} [as stemming]{.mark} [from
race]{.mark} rather than from racism]{.underline}**.
**[[2]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[By [locating]{.mark}]{.underline}** our
reading of **[[race on]{.underline}]{.mark}** the ostensibly dual plane
**[of [the mirror relation alone]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[which leads
to the simpler opposition]{.underline}** now entrenched in cultural
studies **[between the "self" and the "other,"]{.underline}**
**[[we]{.mark} risk [confin]{.mark}ing [race to a notion of the ego as
false consciousness]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Race, we will then be led
to assert, is an illusory, narcissistic construct, and racism is an ego
defense.]{.underline}** [**[3]{.underline}** **[If the order of
race]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[or Whiteness [pertained only to the
subject's]{.mark} assimilation of his/her [ego
ideal]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[then race]{.underline}**]{.mark} as
such **[[would]{.mark} seem to [have nothing to do with the
symbolic]{.mark}]{.underline}** or the real of the unconscious, **[that
is, with the psychical structure of the subject.]{.underline}** **[It
would seem to be free of the effects of the signifier, thereby rendering
language "neutral" and free of "race."]{.underline}** As **[Fanon
implies]{.underline}**, **[racial visibility must be distinguished from
the moment]{.underline}** when **[the subject introjects an ego ideal as
a coherent body image]{.underline}**. **[But by marking the temporal
difference in the constitution of the bodily ego and the raced
body]{.underline}**, **[we will see that]{.underline}** **[the
anxiety]{.underline}** that **[Fanon refers to is not caused by the
ideology of blackness, but by the structure of Whiteness.]{.underline}**
Less cryptically: we will see that **[racial anxiety,]{.underline}**
**[the unconscious anxiety that is entailed by the sight of racial
difference]{.underline}**, **[has its cause not in
ideology]{.underline}**, **[but in the structure of race
itself,]{.underline}** **[and in the functioning of its master
signifier, "Whiteness."]{.underline}** In the following, I return to the
theory of the mirror stage, and examine the process of the integration
of the bodily image to magnify the role of the symbolic in subtending
the body image. I undertake this brief elaboration of Lacan's notion of
the imaginary, which will be familiar to many readers, to clarify my
claim that **[race cannot be mapped onto the simpler theory of
misrecognition and ego identification]{.underline}**, and that one can
do so only through an inadequate understanding of the imaginary, and of
the raced subject. The most extensive discussion of the mirror stage can
be found in Lacan's Seminar I, where he proposes, significantly, a
"substitute" for the mirror stage in an optical experiment (I: 74). In
between a concave mirror and a plane mirror, a vase out of the line of
vision is inverted below a box, with a bouquet of flowers placed upright
above it. The concave mirror reflects a "real" image which projects the
vase upright with the flowers in the vase, with the image itself seeming
to appear behind the mirror as with plane mirror images. Lacan utilizes
this fairly commonplace optical experiment, in several variations, to
characterize the mirror stage as both a "moment in development" and an
"exemplary function," that reveals "the subject's relations to his
image, insofar as it is the Urbild \[prototype\] of the ego" (I: 74,
emphasis added). In other words[, **[the mirror stage
is]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[not yet,]{.underline}** properly speaking,
**[the self-present moment of the total integration of the bodily
ego,]{.underline}** or what Lacan will term **[the ego
ideal]{.underline}**. **[Rather, it is [a]{.mark} [contingent
moment]{.mark} when the primitive "ideal ego" is projected outside as
the outline of a form that promises unity]{.underline}**. **[It is a
projection of a real image but not as yet a reintrojection of the image,
which will]{.underline}** **[necessarily have to be "libidinalized and
narcissised"]{.underline}** (I: 153) in an exchange with the image of
the other, as the bodily ego. **[[The ego ideal]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
as **[distinguished from the ideal ego]{.underline}**, **[is the site of
secondary identifications]{.underline}**, **[and is a]{.underline}**
characteristic **[function of imaginary relations]{.underline}** **[that
literally [enables the subject to see his "libidinal being"]{.mark} [in
relation to the]{.mark} [other]{.mark}]{.underline}** (I: 125--6). This
is primarily **[[because]{.underline}]{.mark}** **["for man [the other
has a captivating value]{.mark},]{.underline}** **[on account of the
anticipation that is represented by the unitary image]{.underline}**
**[as perceived]{.underline}** either in the mirror or in the entire
reality of the fellow being" (I: 125). **[This captation by the
other]{.underline}** **[is also the process of the birth of the bodily
ego,]{.underline}** which is always mediated by desire. **[The
subject]{.underline}** **[originally]{.underline}** **[locates and
recognises]{.underline}** **[desire through the intermediary not only of
his own image, but of the body of his fellow being. [It's]{.mark}
exactly [at that moment]{.mark} [that]{.mark} the human being's
[consciousness]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in the form of consciousness of
self, **[[distinguishes itself]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It is in so far
**[[as he recognises]{.mark} [his desire]{.mark} [in the body of the
other]{.mark} [that the exchange takes place]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It
is in so far as **[his desire has gone over to the other side that he
assimilates himself to the body of the other and recognises himself as
body]{.underline}**. (I: 147) **[Identification,]{.underline}** then**[,
is always mediated by desire,]{.underline}**13 **[and clearly, one's own
desire emerges in the Other]{.underline}**. One consequence of this
formulation is that the body is "factitious" (I: 147), insofar as human
consciousness, which is bound to it, can nevertheless conceive of itself
as distinct. Also, this ability of man to conceive of himself "as other
than he is...entirely structures his fantasy life" (I: 79). The body is
constituted in a see-saw movement of desire. In fact, **[there can be no
imaginary relation or ego function without desire]{.underline}**, and
**[[when]{.mark} we invoke the term "[desire,"]{.mark} [we are
always]{.mark} [in the realm of]{.mark} language and the
[symbolic]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[The symbolic, then, is pivotal for
the very existence of the mirror stage.]{.underline}** The optical
experiment that Lacan invokes to clarify the mirror stage concept
emphasizes the importance of perspective. It is possible that the image
may not be successfully produced if the mirror were to be inclined in
one way or another. For Lacan, this is an indication of "the uneasy
accommodation of the imaginary in man" (I: 140). As he says, "everything
depends on the position of the subject. And **[the position of the
subject]{.underline}**...**[is]{.underline}** essentially
**[characterised by its place in the symbolic world,]{.underline}** in
other words in **[the world of speech"]{.underline}** (I: 80). This
schema then suggests that **[[neither the imaginary nor the mirror stage
can]{.mark} legitimately [claim]{.mark} an [anteriority]{.mark} to the
symbolic]{.underline}**. Even though we tend to schematize "psychical
development" chronologically, probing the structural relation of the
three levels of **[the imaginary, the symbolic and the
Real]{.underline}** reveals that they **[are imbricated in one
another]{.underline}** in an inextricable fashion. In other words, it's
the symbolic relation which defines the position of the subject as
seeing. **[It is speech, [the symbolic relation]{.mark}, which
[determines the]{.mark} greater or lesser [degree of]{.mark} perfection,
of [completeness,]{.mark} of approximation, [of the
imaginary]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[This representation allows us to
draw the distinction between the]{.underline}** Idealich and the
Ichideal, between the **[ideal ego and the egoideal.]{.underline}**
**[The ego-ideal governs the interplay of relations on which all
relations with others depend]{.underline}**. (I: 141, emphasis added)
**[The interplay of relations]{.underline}** with others **[is governed
by desire]{.underline}**---**[a desire that is always of the
Other]{.underline}**. **[[Desire must be understood]{.mark} in its
[mediating]{.mark} role bet[ween the image of the other and the
consciousness of one's own body]{.mark} which the image
engenders]{.underline}**. That is, **[[the subject cannot
recognize]{.mark} his/her [desire except as manifested by the
other]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[as his/her own "ideal
form"]{.underline}** (I: 176). **[Thus it is always alienated from the
subject.]{.underline}** In the human subject, desire is realised in the
other, by the other.... That is the second moment, the specular moment,
the moment when **[the subject]{.underline}** has integrated the form of
the ego. But he **[is only capable of integrating]{.underline}** it
**[after a first swing of the see-saw when he had precisely exchanged
his ego for this other desire which he sees in the other]{.underline}**.
From then on, **[the desire of the other]{.underline}**, **[which is
man's desire enters into the mediation of language]{.underline}**. It is
in the other, by \[par\] the other, that desire is named**[. It enters
into the symbolic relation of I and you]{.underline}**, **[in relation
of mutual recognition]{.underline}** and transcendence, into the order
of a law which is already quite ready to encompass the history of each
individual. (I: 177) Insofar as **[the subject as ego cannot come into
existence except in a symbolic relation]{.underline}** (**[which always
implies desire]{.underline}**), **[it is logically impossible to isolate
the imaginary or ego function from the realm of the
signifies]{.underline}** **[Thus to speak of
identification]{.underline}**---sexual, **[racial]{.underline}**,
etc.---in **[terms of a mirror relation]{.underline}**, **[as pure
image, is to produce an untenable opposition between the image and the
signifier]{.underline}**, or a specious sense of "development" from the
imaginary to the symbolic. Consequently, the body cannot be pure image,
an ego identification produced in the mirror of error; it is, as Bruce
Fink has insisted, "written with signifiers and is thus foreign, Other"
(1995:12). **[[The signifier that constitutes the]{.mark} subject's
[body emerges from the Other]{.mark} as the expression of recognition or
ratification of the mirror image, thereby enabling the image to be
introjected]{.underline}**. The imaginary body has a symbolic status.
**[[As a creature of desire]{.mark}, [the subject invests in the
signifier]{.mark} which marks it, and locates it within a matrix where
"the body" is engendered in submission to the logic of the
signifier.]{.underline}** **[[Thus to believe that we "have" particular
bodies]{.mark} on the basis of a simple visibility [is to ignore
the]{.mark} function of the [signifier]{.mark} in the production of the
seeing subject]{.underline}**. Thus **[the subject's corporeality is
itself constituted as]{.underline}** a **[coherent]{.underline}** image
**[through the intervention of the signifier]{.underline}**. As Lacan
recommends, "One should always work at the level of the alphabet" (I:
35). In other words, **[we must hunt down the signifier behind the image
if we wish to discern the subject of race,]{.underline}** or to put it
even more precisely, we must grasp the contours of the lack that the
signifier stands for, which in turn supports the body image.

#### Racism is not a totalizing dialectic, but operates through regimes of facialization. White supremacy silences race's threatening viscosity by confining it to static definitions of oppression. The aff flows like water.

Spatiality, viscosity, machinism There is an explicit or implicit notion
of space imbricated in any ontology. Thus, Doreen Massey has
consistently attacked the static, nonrelational conception of space of
the modern masculine tradition (Massey, 2005). But neither is the
spatiality Massey defends one of pure flux, in which there are no
\`points\' (compare Doel, 1998). **[What is needed is a concept of space
in which fixity can emerge from flux under certain
conditions]{.underline}**. This is **[different from]{.underline}**
saying that there is **[perpetual vacillation]{.underline}** at infinite
speed **[between two poles,]{.underline}** **[fixity and
flow]{.underline}**, like in some postmodern dialectic or like Derridean
undecidability, even if the poles are effects of the vacillation. Real
process is not vacillary; it is irreversible and messy. **[To evoke the
continuous but constrained dynamism of space, I want to propose the
figure of viscosity. [Neither perfectly fluid nor solid, the viscous
invokes surface tension]{.mark} and resistance to perturbation and
mixing. Viscosity means]{.underline}** that the **[physical
characteristics of a substance explain its unique
movements.]{.underline}** **[[There are local]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
**[[temporary thickenings of interacting bodies, which then collectively
become sticky]{.mark}, capable of c[apturing more bodies like
them:]{.mark}]{.underline}** an emergent slime mold. **[[Under]{.mark}
certain [circumstances, the collectivity dissolves]{.mark}, the
constituent bodies flowing freely again. [The world is an immense mass
of viscosities]{.mark}]{.underline}**, becoming thicker here, and
thinner there. In Genesis, Michel Serres tries to understand emergence,
how unity can emerge from the background noise of multiplicity. At one
point he writes of the \`\`chain of contingency\'\': \`\`No, the
contingent chain does not break, its links slide over one another, as
though viscous. They touch because they are adjacent, they touch like
sailors\' hitches or the loops of motorway cloverleaves are stacked upon
one another. It is not a linkage, but a local pull, by way of little
frictions. The local pull induces global movement very seldom, although
it can happen. This is not a solid chain, it is simply a liquid
movement, a viscosity, a propagation that wagers its age in each
locality\'\' (\[1982\] 1995, page 71, his italics). [**[Race must
similarly be conceived as a chain of contingency,]{.underline}** **[in
which]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the [connections between]{.mark} its
[constituent components]{.mark} [are not given,
but]{.mark}]{.underline}** are made **[[viscous through local
attractions.]{.mark} [Whiteness]{.mark},]{.underline}** for example,
**[[is about the sticky connections between property, privilege,
and]{.mark} a paler [skin]{.mark}. [There is no essence of whiteness,
but]{.mark}]{.underline}** there is **[[a relative fixity]{.mark} that
inheres in all the \`local pulls\' of its many elements in
flux.]{.underline}** **[Emergence and viscosity are
complementary]{.underline}** concepts, **[the first pertaining to the
genesis of distinctions, the second to the modality]{.underline}** of
that genesis. **[Race\'s spatiality is emphatically not about discrete
separations between \`races\'. [Nobody \`has\' a race, but bodies are
racialised]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Gilroy asks: **[\`\`if \`race\' is a
useful way]{.underline}** 18 A Saldanha **[of classifying people, then
[how many \`races\' are there]{.mark}?]{.underline}**\'\' (2000, page
37). **[This question [betrays a logic of solids and
grids]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The concept of race is not for taxonomic
ordering, but for studying the movements between human bodies, things,
and their changing environment. The concept of race is like the concept
of subculture, or diseaseönobody wants to know how many subcultures or
diseases there are, but how they come to be. **[What [are the
constituent components of race? Potentially
everything]{.mark},]{.underline}** but certainly strands of **[[DNA,
phenotyp]{.mark}ical variation, [discursive practice]{.mark}s (law,
media, science), [artefacts]{.mark}]{.underline}** such as clothes and
food, **[and]{.underline}** the distribution of
**[[wealth]{.underline}]{.mark}**. How these are connected is entirely
immanent to the way certain humans behave in certain circumstances.
Sarah **[Whatmore]{.underline}** (2002) **[might call
race]{.underline}** intrinsically **[more-than-human, [irreducible to
either biology or culture]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Deleuze and
Guattari\'s A Thousand Plateaus can be understood as a conceptualisation
of irreducible and immanent heterogeneities like race (though they do
not explicitly confirm that race is such a heterogeneity). **[They call
these heterogeneities [machinic assemblages]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
**[\`\`Taking the feudal assemblage as an example, we would have to
consider the interminglings of bodies defining feudalism: the body of
the earth]{.underline}** and **[the social body]{.underline}**; the body
of the **[overlord,]{.underline}** the **[vassal,]{.underline}** the
**[serf]{.underline}**; the body of **[the knight]{.underline}** and
**[the horse]{.underline}** and their new relation to the stirrup;
**[the weapons]{.underline}** and tools **[assuring a symbiosis
of]{.underline}** bodiesöa whole **[machinic assemblage]{.underline}**.
We would also have to consider statements, expressions, the juridical
regime of heraldry, all of the incorporeal transformations, in
particular, oaths and their variables (the oath of obedience, but also
the oath of love, etc.): the collective assemblage of enunciation. On
the other axis, we would have to consider the feudal territorialities
and reterritorializations, and at the same time the line of
deterritorialization that carries away both the knight and his mount,
statements and acts. We would have to consider how all this combines in
the Crusades\'\' (Deleuze and Guattari, \[1980\] 1987, page 89). **[A
machinic geography of bodies asks what immanent connections they forge
with things and places,]{.underline}** how they work, travel, fight,
write, loveöhow **[these [bodies become viscous, slow down]{.mark}, get
[into certain habits]{.mark}, into certain
[collectivities]{.mark}]{.underline}**, like city, social stratum, or
**[[racial formation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Machinism is wary of
mediation: it prefers connections and viscosities. **[Machinism asks how
incredibly diverse processes]{.underline}** (such as agriculture and
sexuality, religion and property law) **[interlock, [like cogs and
wheels instead of signifiers and signifieds]{.mark}.]{.underline}** But
machinism is not physicalism. It understands entities not as perfectly
knowable cause \^ effect sequences, but as bundles of virtual
capacities. Approaching phenotype machinically means being prepared for
the unpreparable: **[phenotype connects in infinite ways.]{.underline}**
Living, social machines are not machines in the narrow sense, because
they lack a preconceived \`function\' and are constantly evolving. **[A
quick return to Fanon to elucidate the machinic assemblage of
race.]{.underline}** Another well-known quote: \`\`The native town is a
hungry town, starved of bread, of meat, of shoes, of coal, of light. The
native town is a crouching village, a town on its knees, a town
wallowing in the mire. It is a town of niggers and dirty arabs. The look
that the native turns on the settler\'s town is a look of lust, a look
of envy; it expresses his dreams of possessionöall manner of possession:
to sit at the settler\'s table, to sleep in the settler\'s bed, with his
wife if possible. The colonized man is an envious man. And this the
settler knows very well; when their glances meet he ascertains bitterly,
always on the defensive \`They want to take our place\'. It is true, for
there is no native who does not dream at least once a day of setting
himself up in the settler\'s place\'\' (\[1961\] 1967, page 30).
Reontologising race 19 Numerous **[authors have theorised about the
intersection of possession, sexuality, urbanism and race]{.underline}**
(for example Low, 1996). **[[The machinic geography]{.mark} of
phenotype, however, [takes issue with the Hegelian self/other
scheme]{.mark} [that supports much of \[Fanon's\] work, and studies
instead how certain bodies stick to certain
spaces]{.mark},]{.underline}** how they are **[chained by hunger,
cold,]{.underline}** darkness, mud, poverty, crime, glances **[full of
envy and anxiety]{.underline}**. **[[The segregation between colonists
and colonised is the]{.underline}]{.mark}** apparently **[[binary
result]{.mark} of many]{.underline}** nitty-gritty **[material
processes]{.underline}** **[which, [when analysed, render it a lot less
binary]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This also means **[race is devious in
inventing new ways of chaining bodies. Race is creative, constantly
morphing,]{.underline}** now disguised as sexual desire, now as la
mission civilatrice, all the while weaving new elements in its wake.
Deleuze and Guattari might say that **[[what defines race is not
rigidity]{.underline}]{.mark}** or inevitability, **[[but its \`\`lines
of flight\'\']{.mark}.]{.underline}** Race can be as stark as apartheid,
but mostly it is fuzzy and operates through something else. The social
sciences literature on race (urban geography, postcolonial theory, film
studies) remains relevant from the machinic perspective. **[[Race is
shown to exist through ghettoes, travel writing, and Hollywood
cinema]{.mark}. What this literature shows is precisely race\'s plastic,
emergent, and more-than-human spatiality]{.underline}** (for example,
Anderson, 1991; hooks, 1992; Jackson and Penrose, 1993; Jacobs, 1996;
Robinson, 1996). Still, more geographical and anthropological work needs
to be done to theorise the biocultural imbrications of race. For
example, in the introduction to the collection Race, Nature and the
Politics of Difference it is argued that \`\`both
**[[race]{.mark}]{.underline}** and nature
**[[are]{.mark}]{.underline}** historical artefacts: **[[assemblages of
material, discourse, and practice irreducible to a single timeless
essence]{.mark}.]{.underline}** By charting the ways in which race and
nature work together, and by tracing key disruptions in their busy
traffic, we emphasize the cultural labors required to maintain them as
they are. \... **[[We write against racisms -- not against
\`race\']{.mark} [but against the exclusionary effects produced through
its invocation]{.mark}, deployment, and reproduction\'\']{.underline}**
(Moore et al, 2003, page 42). But the full implications of the term
assemblageöthat it includes biological and other nonhuman forcesöstill
need to be explored. There is some work being done that quietly
disrespects the disciplinary boundaries of modern epistemology.
Anthropologically inclined medical research has the potential to offer a
critical approach to the biocultural aspects of racial division (Wade,
2002, pages 117 \^ 122). Luca Cavalli-Sforza maps human migration using
genetics and physical anthropology as well as archaeology, linguistics,
and history (Cavalli-Sforza et al, 1994). This research deserves
theoretical attention, so that more rigorous studies of the discursive,
technological, and economic embeddedness of phenotype can be imagined.
Zack (2002) has recently argued that physical anthropology can only
account for variation through heredity, not the folk (taxonomic)
conception of race as such. She therefore continues to define \`race\'
as an essentialist social construction which has no basis in the science
of phenotype. **[[What is needed]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, **[[is
to highjack the]{.mark} folk c[onception]{.mark} and rethink race as
culturally embedded phenotype.]{.underline}** **[Saying that race has no
basis in biology is different]{.underline}** from saying that phenotype
plays some role in racial differentiation. **[[Phenotype is a crucial
element]{.mark} in the assemblage called race,]{.underline}** **[and,
[because phenotype is already]{.mark} nondiscrete and [shaped by
culture, race cannot be an essentialist concept]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
**[Now, [what does this nonessentialism mean to antiracist
politics?]{.mark}]{.underline}** A thousand tiny races **[[Every time
phenotype makes another machinic connection, there is a stutter. Every
time bodies are further entrenched in segregation]{.mark}, however
brutal, [there needs to be an affective investment of some sort. This is
the ruptural moment in which to intervene]{.mark}.]{.underline}** 20 A
Saldanha **[[Race should not be eliminated, but proliferated,]{.mark}
[its]{.mark} many [energies directed at multiplying racial
differences]{.mark} so as [to render them joyfully
cacophonic]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Many in American critical race theory
also argue against a utopian transcendence of race, taking from W E B Du
Bois and pragmatism a reflexive, sometimes strategically nationalist
attitude towards racial embodiment (compare Outlaw, 1996; Shuford, 2001;
Winant, 2004). **[[What is needed is an affirmation
of]{.mark}]{.underline}** race\'s creativity and virtuality: **[[what
race can be.]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[Race need [not]{.mark} be ab[out
order and oppression,]{.mark} [it can be wild,]{.mark}
far-from-equilibrium, [liberatory.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[It is not
that everyone becomes]{.mark}]{.underline}** completely Brownian (or
[**[brown]{.underline}**!]{.mark}), completely **[[similar,
or]{.underline}]{.mark}** completely **[[unique. It
is]{.underline}]{.mark}** just **[[that white supremacism becomes
strenuous as]{.mark} many p[opulations start harbouring a similar
economic,]{.mark} technological, [cultural productivity as whites do
now, linking all sorts of bodies]{.mark} with all sorts of wealth and
all sorts of ways of life.]{.underline}** That is, **[[race exists in
its true mode when it is no longer stifled by
racism.]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[\`\`The race-tribe exists only at the
level of an oppressed race, and in the name of the oppression it
suffers; there is no race but inferior, minoritarian; there is no
dominant race; a race is defined not by its purity but rather by the
impurity conferred upon it by a system of domination]{.underline}**.
Bastard and mixed-blood are the true names of race\'\' (Deleuze and
Guattari, \[1980\] 1987, page 379). In \`\`A thousand tiny sexes\'\',
Grosz (1994b) follows a well-known passage of Deleuze and Guattari to
argue for non-Hegelian, indeed protohuman feminism that utilises lines
of flight of the gender assemblage to combat heterosexist patriarchy.
\`\`If we consider the great binary aggregates, such as the sexes or
classes, it is evident that they also cross over into molecular
assemblages of a different nature, and that there is a double reciprocal
dependency between them. For the two sexes imply a multiplicity of
molecular combinations bringing into play not only the man in the woman
and the woman in the man, but the relation of each to the animal, the
plant, etc.: a thousand tiny sexes\'\' (Deleuze and Guattari, \[1980\]
1987, page 213). Similarly, **[the molecularisation of race would
consist in its breaking up into a thousand tiny races.]{.underline}** It
is from here that cosmopolitanism should start: the pleasure, curiosity,
and concern in encountering a multiplicity of corporeal fragments
outside of common-sense taxonomies. \`\`We walk the streets among
hundreds of people whose patterns of lips, breasts, and genital organs
we divine; they seem to us equivalent and interchangeable. Then
something snares our attention: a dimple speckled with freckles on the
cheek of a woman; a steel choker around the throat of a man in a
business suit; a gold ring in the punctured nipple on the hard chest of
a deliveryman; a big raw fist in the delicate hand of a schoolgirl; a
live python coiled about the neck of a lean, lanky adolescent with
coal-black skin. Signs of clandestine disorder in the uniformed and
coded crowds\'\' (Lingis, 2000, page 142). **[Machinism against racism
builds upon a gradual, fragmented, and shifting sense of corporeal
difference, that of course extends far further than the
street.]{.underline}** **[[Responsibility, activism, and antiracist
policy will follow only from feeling and understanding]{.mark} [the
geographical differentials]{.mark} that exist between many different
kinds of bodies: [between a Jew and a black soldier, between a woman in
the Sahel and]{.mark}]{.underline}** a woman in **[[Wall Street, between
a Peruvian peasant and a Chinese journalist]{.mark}.]{.underline}** A
machinic politics of race takes into account the real barriers to
mobility and imagination that exist in different places; cosmopolitanism
has to be invented, not imposed. It may seem that machinism is as
**[utopian]{.underline}** and open ended as Gilroy\'s transcendent
antiracism. **[It is not, because [it is empirical, immanent, and
pragmatic]{.mark}. The machinic geography of phenotype shows that racism
differs from place to place]{.underline}**, and cannot be overcome in
any simple way. **[It shows that [white supremacy can subside only by
Reontologising race]{.mark}]{.underline}** 21 **[changing the rules of
education, or the financial sector]{.underline}**, or the arms trade, or
the pharmaceutical industry, **[or whatever. For machinic politics, the
cultural studies [preoccupations with]{.mark} apology,
recognition]{.underline}**, politically correct language and
**[reconsiliation,]{.underline}** **[or else [cultural
hybridity]{.mark},]{.underline}** pastiche, and ambivalence,
**[t[hreaten to stand in the way]{.mark} of really doing something about
the global structures of racism.]{.underline}** **[A thousand tiny races
can be made only if it is acknowledged that racism is a material,
inclusive series of events, a viscous geography which cannot be
\`signified away\'.]{.underline}** Miscegenation, openness to strangers,
exoticism in art, and experimentations with whiteness can certainly
help. But ultimately cosmpolitanism without critique and intervention
remains complacent with its own comfortably mobile position. In a word,
ethics encompasses politics, and politics starts with convincing people
of race\'s materiality.

#### The alt can't solve the case and anti-blackness doesn't explain anti-Asian violence. Our argument isn't that their impacts aren't important, but that their exclusion of our theorization is unproductive.

**[The reality of race in the U.S. has always been more complicated than
black/white.]{.underline}** The initial exclusionary laws concerning
testimony in court, as mentioned earlier, grouped \"blacks, mulattoes,
and Native Americans.\" The **[[Chinese laborers brought to the
West]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[in the 1800\'s]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[had specific]{.mark} rulings and [ideological justifications]{.mark}
[used against them]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[restricting]{.mark} their
[right]{.mark}]{.underline}** not only **[[to
vote]{.mark}]{.underline}** or **[own [property]{.mark}]{.underline}**
but even **[to [marry other Chinese]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[This
latter ruling outlasted slavery]{.underline}** and was **[justified by
invoking images of Asian overpopulation]{.underline}**. To avoid
reproduction, **[[Chinese women were allowed to come as prostitutes but
not as wives]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a restriction no other group faced.
**[The Mexicans]{.underline}** defeated in the Mexican-American War
**[were portrayed as cruel and cowardly barbarians]{.underline}**, and
although the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo ratified in 1848 guaranteed the
Mexicans who stayed in the U.S. full rights of citizenship, like the
treaties with Native Americans **[neither local govern ments nor the
federal courts upheld the Mexicans right to vote]{.underline}** **[or
respected the land deeds]{.underline}** they held before the Treaty.18
By the time of the Spanish American War of 1898 **[the image of
barbarism]{.underline}** used against Mexicans **[was
consistently]{.underline}** attributed to a Latin-Catholic heritage and
**[expanded]{.underline}** for use **[throughout Latin American and the
Caribbean]{.underline}**, thus subsequently **[affecting the immigrant
populations]{.underline}** coming from these countries **[as well as
justifying U.S. claims of hegemony in the region]{.underline}**.19
**[The]{.underline}** **[so-called Zoot Suit riots in L]{.underline}**os
**[A]{.underline}**ngeles **[in 1943]{.underline}** **[targeted Mexicans
and their ethnically specific style of dress]{.underline}**. The
**[attempts]{.underline}** made **[to geographically
sequester]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** also to
**[forcibly]{.underline}** and totally **[assimilate Native American
groups]{.underline}** **[were not experienced by any
other]{.underline}** group, **[and had their own ideological justifi
cations that combined contradictory images of the Great Chain of Being
with the romanticized Noble Savage]{.underline}**. Native peoples were
represented as vanquished, disappearing, and thus of no account. **[The
paradigm of an antiblack racism]{.underline}** intertwined with slavery
**[does not]{.underline}** help to **[illuminate these]{.underline}**
and other specific **[experiences of other nonwhite
groups]{.underline}**, **[where ideologies]{.underline}** often relied
**[on charges of evil, religious backwardness, horde mentalities, being
a disappearing people, and other projections not used in regard to
African Americans. [The hegemony of the black/white
paradigm]{.mark}]{.underline}** has **[stymied]{.underline}** the
**[development of an adequate account of]{.underline}** the **[diverse
racial realities in the U.S., and [weakened the general theories of
racism]{.mark}]{.underline}** which attempt to be truly inclusive.
**[This has had a negative effect on]{.underline}** our ability to
develop **[effective solutions]{.underline}** to the various forms
racism can take, to make common cause against ethnic and race based
forms of oppression **[and to create lasting coalitions]{.underline}**,
and has recently played a significant role in the demise of affirmative
action. I will support these claims further in what follows. **[Critics
of the black/white paradigm]{.underline}** have **[argue]{.underline}**d
**[that, although]{.underline}** all **[communities of
color]{.underline}** have **[share]{.underline}**d **[the experience of
political and economic disenfranchisement]{.underline}** in the U.S.,
**[there are significant differences between the causes and the
forms]{.underline}** of this disenfranchisement. **[Bong Hwan Kim, a
Korean American community leader]{.underline}** who has worked both as
the Director of the Korean Community Center of East Bay in Oakland, CA,
and as Director of the Korean Youth and Community Center in Los Angeles,
b**[lames the black/white binary for disabling relationships among
people of color]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** even for
**[creating the conditions leading to the Los Angeles civil disaster of
April 1992]{.underline}**, **[in which 2,300 small Korean owned busi
nesses were destroyed by mostly Latino/a and African American
looters]{.underline}**. Kim cites the xenophobia marshaled by African
American leader Danny Bakewell before the looting occurred, and argues
that the Korean Amer ican community had been and continues to be
systematically rendered incapable of responding to such rhetoric because
they are not recognized in the media as a player in racial politics.20
Elaine Kim explains: It is difficult to describe how disempowered and
frustrated many Korean Americans felt during and after the sa-i-ku
p\'ok-dong (the April 29 \"riots\"). **[Korean Americans]{.underline}**
across the country **[shared the anguish and despair of the Los Angeles
tongp\'o (community),]{.underline}** **[which everyone seemed to have
abandoned]{.underline}** - the police and fire departments, **[black and
white political leaders]{.underline}**, the Asian and Pacific American
advocates who tried to dissociate themselves from us because our tragedy
disputed their narrow and risk-free focus on white violence against
Asians \... the Korean Americans at the center of the storm were mostly
voiceless and all but invisible (except when stereotyped as hysterically
inarticulate, and mostly female, ruined shopkeepers .. .).21 Similar to
the Mexicans in Texas, the **[Koreans have been denied the legal or
socially recognized category of being a politicized group]{.underline}**
at the same time that they are made **[subject to group based
scapegoating]{.underline}**. Moreover, as **[this event
demonstrates]{.underline}**, **[the black/white paradigm]{.underline}**
of race **[is incapable of theoretically]{.underline}** or politically
**[addressing racism]{.underline}** among communities of color, or
racism, in other words, which is not all about white people. **[A
response to this line of reasoning might be that]{.underline}** it is
**[white supremacy]{.underline}** which **[is at the root]{.underline}**
of the conflictual relations among communities of color, **[and
responsible for their acceptance of stereotypes manufactured by a white
dominant power structure]{.underline}**. Thus, on this reading, what
occurred in Los Angeles can be reductively analyzed as caused by white
supremacy. Although I do find explanatory arguments that focus on
political economy often compelling, **[it is far too
simplistic]{.underline}**, as I think Karl Marx himself knew, to imagine
cultural conflict as the mere epiphenomenon of economic forces with no
life or grounding of their own. **[[To blame only white
supremacy]{.underline}]{.mark}** for what occurred in Los Angeles
**[[would]{.mark} also [deny power and agency to any groups but the
dominant]{.mark}, which is increasingly untrue.]{.underline}** [**[We
must all accept our rightful share of the blame]{.underline}**,]{.mark}
whatever that turns out to be in particular instances, **[[and resist
explanations]{.mark} [that would]{.mark} a priori [reduce]{.mark} that
[blame to zero for communities of color]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Supporting the arguments of both Elaine Kim and Bong Hwan Kim, Juan
Perea argues that because of the wide acceptance of the black/white
paradigm, \"other racialized groups like Latino/as, Asian Americans, and
Native Americans are often marginalized or ignored altogether.\"22 He
points out that the concerns of Asian Americans and Latino/as cannot be
addressed through immigration legislation because all are not
immigrants, which is one of the reasons to reject the claim of some
ethnic theorists that these groups will follow the path of European
immigrants in gradual assimilation and economic success (the other
reason to reject this claim is their racialization).23 Roberto Suro
argues that the black/white binary disadvantages Latino/as and other
people of color who are not African Americans by forcing them to adopt
the strategies of civil rights litigation even though it was \"not
particularly well-suited to Latino/as\" who are a much more diverse
group.24 For example, any meaningful redress of economic discrimination
affecting Latino/as and Asian Americans will need to disaggregate these
groups, as some \"target of opportunity\" programs today in fact do,
since the gap between median incomes in Filipino and Japanese
households, or between Puerto Rican and Cuban households, makes aver
aging these incomes useless as an indicator of economic success. Richard
Delgado argues that \"If one\'s paradigm identifies only one group as
deserving of protection, everyone else is likely to suffer.\" Current
civil rights legislation, in Delgado\'s view, has provided legal
advantages for African Americans, unwittingly perhaps, over other people
of color. I do not take Delgado to be implying that the legislation has
effectively benefited the African American population and been applied
forcefully and universally, but that the language of the law, however
much it has yet to be applied, identifies only one group and this is a
problem. Just as the protection of the right of property advantages the
propertied, and the protection of free speech increases the influence of
those who are articulate and can afford microphones, TV air time, and so
on \... the Equal Protection Clause produces a social good, namely
equality, for those falling under its coverage - blacks and whites.
These it genuinely helps - at least on occasion. But it leaves everyone
else unprotected.25 **[Put in more general terms, these arguments can be
summarized as follows:]{.underline}** **[1) [The black/white paradigm
has disempowered]{.mark} various [racial and ethnic groups from being
able to]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[define their]{.underline}**]{.mark}
own **[[identity]{.mark},]{.underline}** to **[mark their difference and
specificity beyond]{.underline}** what could be captured on **[this
limited map]{.underline}**. Instead of naming and describing our own
identity and social circumstance, we have had descriptions foisted on us
from outside. **[2) [Asian Americans]{.mark} and
Latino/as]{.underline}** **[[have historically been
ignored]{.mark}]{.underline}** or marginalized [**[in]{.underline}**
t]{.mark}he **[[public discourse]{.mark} in the U.S. on race and
racism]{.underline}**. This is a problem for two reasons, first, because
it is simply unfair to be excluded from what concerns one, and second,
because **[it has considerably weakened the analysis of race and racism
in the mainstream discussions]{.underline}**. **[To explain the social
situation of Asian Americans or Latino/as]{.underline}** **[simply in
terms of their de jure and de facto treatment as
nonwhites]{.underline}** **[is to describe our condition only on the
most shallow terms]{.underline}**. We must be included in the
discussions so that a more adequate account can be developed**[. 3) By
eliminating specificities within the large \"black\" or nonwhite
group,]{.underline}** **[[the black/white binary]{.underline}]{.mark}**
has **[[undercut the possibility of developing]{.underline}]{.mark}**
appropriate and effective legal and political
**[[solutions]{.underline}]{.mark}** for the variable forms that racial
oppression can take. A broad movement for civil rights does not require
that we ignore the specific circumstances of different racial or ethnic
identities, nor does it mandate that only the similarities can figure
into the formulation of protective legisla tion. I will discuss an
example of this problem, one that concerns the application of
affirmative action in higher education, at the end of this essay**[. 4)
Another]{.underline}** major **[disadvantage of eliminating
specificities]{.underline}** **[within the]{.underline}** large
\"black\" or **[nonwhite group]{.underline}** **[is]{.underline}** that
**[one cannot then either under stand or address the real conflicts and
differences within this amalgam of peoples.]{.underline}** The
black/white paradigm proposes to understand all conflicts between
communities of color through anti-black racism, when the reality is
often more complex. **[5)]{.underline}** For all these reasons, **[[the
black/white paradigm]{.underline}]{.mark}** seriously
**[[undermines]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[possibility
of]{.underline}** achieving **[[coalitions.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Without being a conspiracy theorist, **[it is obvious that keeping us in
conflict with each other and not in coalition is in the interests of the
current power structure.]{.underline}** I would add to these arguments
the following two. **[6) The black/white binary]{.underline}** **[and
the]{.underline}** constant **[invocation of all race]{.underline}**
discourses and **[conflicts as between blacks and whites has produced an
imaginary of race in this country in which a very large white majority
confronts a relatively small black minority,]{.underline}** **[which has
the effect of reenforcing the sense of inevitability to white
domination.]{.underline}** **[This is not the reality of racial
percentages]{.underline}** in almost any major urban center in the
country today. **[Nonwhites outnumber whites]{.underline}** in New York,
NY, Miami, FL, Chicago, IL, Atlanta, GA, and Los Angeles, CA, and come
very close in San Francisco, CA, Dallas, TX, and Washington DC. The
original intent of the electoral college was to protect small states and
create a buffer between the hoi polloi and the U.S. Government, but the
current effect of the electoral college given these changed demo
graphics has the added \"advantage\" of disenfranchising the occupants
of cities generally and people of color specifically from influencing
national electoral outcomes. If the popular vote determined elections,
the cities would have the determining numbers of votes, since this is
where the majority of U.S. citizens now live and where the trend of
movement is toward. The numbers and concentrations of people of color in
the U.S. means that we are quickly moving past the politics of
recognition, where people of color clamor for recognition from the all
powerful majority, and reaching the politics of power negotiation, where
we can negotiate from a position of power rather than having to rely
exclusively on moral appeals. **[The white majority will not maintain
its near hegemonic political control as new configurations of alliances
develop.]{.underline}**26 Moreover, the white majority is far from
monolithic, splintering most notably along gender and class lines: the
gender gap has widened in electoral politics along with the gap between
union and non-union households (the two largest gaps in the last
presidential election), with droves of white women and white union
members voting the same as the majority of people of color. Thus,
thinking of race in terms only of black and white produces a sense of
inevitability to white domination which is not empirically supportable.
I believe this issue of imagery is very significant. Whites must come to
realize that maintaining white dominance for much longer is simply not a
viability, short of fascism, or significantly expanding the fascist
treat ments that many communities already experience. By maintaining the
black/white binary we only persist in falsely representing the realities
of race in the U.S.; by opening up the binary to rainbow images and the
like we can more accurately and thus helpfully present the growing and
future conditions within which political action and contestations will
occur. This is in everyone\'s interests. For this reason, the
increasingly high profile of Asian Americans, Native Americans, and
Latino/as is all to the good. It may also someday lead away from the
imagery of oppositionality, or mutually exclusive interests, which the
very terms black and white have long conveyed, and move toward an
imagery of pluralism (which has some of its own problems, I realize, but
which can more readily recognize the diverse ways in which alliances and
differences can occur**[). 7)]{.underline}** The next argument that I
would make in regard to **[[the black/white
binary]{.mark}]{.underline}** is that it **[[mistakenly configures
race]{.mark} imagistically [as exclusively having to do with
color]{.mark},]{.underline}** **[as if color alone determines racial
identity]{.underline}** (which has not been the case even for African
Americans), **[and it makes it seem as if between African Americans and
European Americans]{.underline}** **[all]{.underline}** the **[other
races]{.underline}** **[must be lined up]{.underline}** somewhere **[on
this continuum of color since \"white\" and \"black\" clearly represent
the polar extremes]{.underline}**. **[[There is certainly a racist
continuum of color]{.underline}]{.mark}** operat ing in this and in many
countries, **[[but this]{.mark} continuum [is not the only axis]{.mark}
by which racism operates]{.underline}**. Some have taken the horrific
reality of the hierarchy of adoption prefer ences in the U.S., that runs
basically from white to Asian to Latino/a to black, as indicative of the
existence of this continuum of color. Related to this idea is **[the
claim made by some that Asian Americans and Latino/as will eventually
\"become\" white]{.underline}**, so let me address this first. The claim
that Asians and Latino/as will become white is first of all premised on
the assumption that we have two choices of racialized identities: white
and black. If a group is not economically and politically located at or
near the bottom of the society, which the black/white paradigm associ
ates exclusively with \"blackness,\" then such a group is assumed to
have achieved \"whiteness.\" What this claim forgets, among other
things, is the significant racial and class variety within each of these
large amalga mated groups. Moreover, the discrimination faced by Asian
Americans and Latino/as will not likely lose its focus on language and
cultural issues; the more Latino/as there are, the more virulent
\"English Only\" campaigns become. The claim also ignores the
overwhelming evidence showing that most Latino/as persist in their
identities for multiple generations, against their own economic
interests.27 And it seems inapplicable entirely to Asian Americans, who
may be represented as having some so-called white attributes, but who
have never been legally or socially accepted here as white.28 **[[There
are]{.mark} three [major differences between]{.mark} the [groups who
have]{.mark} [had \"success\" in becoming white, and]{.mark} Latino/as
and [Asian Americans]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[The groups I am
referring to]{.underline}** here, and about whom there is some very good
historical research emerging, **[are the Irish and (white Anglo) Jewish
Amer icans]{.underline}**. **[Whether Jews have wholly made it is
debatable]{.underline}**; they seem to move back and forth, as they did
in Germany. For the Klu Klux Klan, still influ ential in many parts of
the U.S., Jews are not white. And even the U.S. mainstream, one might
suggest, seems able to accept an Alan Greenspan as \"finance czar\" but
not a Jewish President of the U.S.29 The U.S. has already had Irish
presidents. In regard, however, to the differences between Irish and
Jews on the one hand and Asian Americans and Latino/as on the other,
**[[the first]{.mark} obvious significant difference [is]{.mark} in
their racialized differences [based]{.mark} largely [on]{.mark} color
and physical [appearance]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[The Irish
and Jews can \"blend in\" to U.S. society in a way that Asian Americans
and]{.underline}** most **[Latino/as cannot]{.underline}**. The
**[admission of the Irish and Jews into]{.underline}** the category
**[\"white\" did not require]{.underline}** **[challenging the idea that
superior characteristics come from European societies]{.underline}**,
and that superior characteristics are **[correlated to light skin
color]{.underline}**. If nonwhites or non-light-skinned people were to
become white, white ness would begin to deconstruct, perhaps mutating to
a cultural and ethnic designation which still is marked by superiority,
but it is not obvious that whiteness is on the threshold of
deconstruction. Thus, to admit Asians and Latino/as into the category
would cause necessary changes that were not necessary for the Irish and
Jews. **[[The second]{.mark} difference [is
historical]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[The Irish and Jews
represent bad memories within Europe, memories of colonialism and
genocide,]{.underline}** **[and thus they operate as the symbolic
representation of Europe\'s moral failings.]{.underline}** The **[Irish
and Jews do not have that symbolic meaning in the U.S,]{.underline}**
and in fact may carry the opposite symbolic meaning in **[representing
the idea that \"anyone\" can make it]{.underline}** and be accepted
here, **[even those who were despised in Europe.]{.underline}** **[In
contrast, African, Mexican and Native Americans, most
notably]{.underline}**, among others, **[represent a symbolic reminder
of the hollowness of claims to white moral superiority]{.underline}**.
**[[The Irish and Jews are not a psychic threat to the ideological
supremacy of white]{.mark} identity]{.underline}** in **[the same way
that many Latino/as, Asian Americans, and]{.underline}** certainly
**[African Americans are[. A third]{.mark} major difference [concerns
perceived assimilability]{.mark}]{.underline}**, although here the Irish
and Jews must separate. The Irish are perceived as entirely assimilable;
Jews only partly so because of religion (which is another reason Jews
tend to be moved back and forth). Latino/as, to the extent they are
European, come from a Spanish Catholic culture considered pre modern and
less civilized, and to the extent they are also indigenous, come from a
culture perceived as totally different than Anglo-European. **[The
symbolic]{.underline}** **[opposition between \"east\" and
\"west,\"]{.underline}** **[or the Orient and the
Occident,]{.underline}** is well-known to be a major prop of the
Anglo-European self-image fomenting a plethora of such dichotomies as
between **[\"individu alism versus collectivism,\" \"democracy versus
despotism,\" and future oriented versus backward oriented
societies.]{.underline}** **[The very definition of Asian culture given
in these orientalist constructions is to be non-western and incapable of
assimilation.]{.underline}** The possibility of synthesis is not
considered. This issue of assimilability has become more rather than
less important in recent years, with political theorists such as Peter
Brimelow and Samuel Huntington making open claims to continue the
dominance of European cultural traditions, against liberal immigration
laws and cultural integra tion, and asserting that the very survival of
\"western civilization\" is at stake.30 **[Because of these three major
differences, I cannot see Asian Americans and Latino/as \"becoming\"
white; it is still proving difficult enough to be seen as
\"American.\"]{.underline}** Thus, the claim that Asian Americans and
Latino/as will become white ignores the issue of color and other
differences, takes no notice of the varying symbolic meanings
represented by these groups, and forgets the problem of
\"assimilability.\" It returns us to the problem of misidentifi cation
discussed earlier, refusing to recognize the complexity by which people
can be vilified. To give another example of this complexity, Asians and
Jews can be grouped together in the ways that their cultures have been
seen as in some respects superior, threatening, and monolithic. In other
words, unlike for African Americans and Latino/as, Asians and Jews are
not seen as having inferior intelligence or primitive cultures, yet they
are seen as essentialized groups with collective goals to take over the
world and/or evil intent toward those outside their groups (the \"yellow
peril\" and \"Jewish world conspiracy\"). This kind of ideology requires
specific analysis, because it operates differently vis-a-vis, among
other issues, affirmative action concerns in regard to higher education.
**[The most recent issue that has arisen since September
11,]{.underline}**2001, **[involves the representations of Arab
Americans]{.underline}**, a group that is very much
**[racialized]{.underline}**. **[Yet again, their racialization works in
specific ways mediated by ideological claims about]{.underline}** their
**[cultures and most notably]{.underline}** **[the religion of
Islam]{.underline}**. **[[Racial oppression works on multiple
axes]{.underline}]{.mark}**, I would argue, **[with [color]{.mark} being
the most dominant and currently most pernicious]{.underline}**. **[But
color is not exhaustive]{.underline}** of all the forms racial
oppression can take. **[The most pejora tive terms used against Asian
Americans]{.underline}** **[often have a racial connotation but without
a color connotation - \"Chinks,\" \"slant-eyes,\"]{.underline}** and for
the Vietnamese, **[\"gooks.\"]{.underline}** These terms denigrate a
whole people, not a partic ular set of customs or a specific history,
and thus **[parallel the essentializing move of racist discourse that
universalizes negative value across a group that is demarcated on the
basis of visible features.]{.underline}** The two most **[pejorative
terms]{.underline}** widely **[used against Latino/as]{.underline}** in
this country **[have been the terms \"spic\"]{.underline}** - **[whose
genealogy references]{.underline}** people who were **[heard by
Anglos]{.underline}** as saying **[\"no spic English\"]{.underline}** -
**[and \"wetback.\"]{.underline}** The first invokes the denigration of
language**[, the second denigrates]{.underline}** both **[where people
came from and how they got here:]{.underline}** **[from Mexico across
the Rio Grande]{.underline}**. **[Mexican Americans were also called
\"greasers\" which connoted the condition of their hair]{.underline}**,
not their skin color. Thus, these terms demonstrate the possibility of a
racial ization and racism that works through constructing and then
denigrating other racialized features and characteristics besides color.
**[We might think of these as two independent axes of racialization that
operate through phys ical features other than color, and through
genealogies of [cultural origin]{.mark}. There is, then, the color
axis]{.underline}**, the physical characteristics other than color axis,
**[and the cultural origin axis]{.underline}**. The discrimination
against Asian Americans and Latino/as has **[also]{.underline}**
operated **[very strongly on a fourth axis of
\"[nativism.]{.mark}\"]{.underline}** **[Nativism is a prejudice against
immigrants;]{.underline}** thus it is distinct, though **[often related
to, xenophobia]{.underline}** or the rejection of foreigners. Rodolfo
Acufia explains that historical nativism is also distinct from
anthropological nativism, which refers to a \"revival of indigenous
culture,\" because historical nativism refers to the belief of some
Anglo-Americans that they are \"the true Americans, excluding even the
Indian\" because they represent in their cultural heritage the \"idea\"
of \"America.\"31 On this view, **[the problem with Asian Americans and
Latino/as is not just that they are seen as foreign; they are seen as
ineluctably foreign]{.underline}**, **[from inferior
cultures]{.underline}** (**[morally and politically if not
intellectually]{.underline}**), **[incapable of]{.underline}** and
unmotivated toward **[assimilation]{.underline}** to the superior
mainstream white Anglo culture. **[They want to keep their
languages]{.underline}**, demand instruction in public schools in their
primary languages, and they often maintain their own **[holidays,
cuisines, religions, and living areas]{.underline}** (the latter
sometimes by choice). Despite the fact that Mexican Americans have been
living within the current U.S. borders for longer than most
Anglo-Americans, **[they are all too often seen as squat ters on U.S.
soil]{.underline}**, **[interlopers who \"belong\"
elsewhere]{.underline}**. **[This \"xenophobia]{.underline}** directed
within\" has been especially virulent at specific times in U.S. history,
during and after both world wars for example, and **[is enjoying a
resurgence now with the war fever and hysteria against Arabs or anyone
wearing a turban]{.underline}**, the serious erosion of civil liberties
for racially profiled groups, the political rhetoric of **[Pat
Buchanan]{.underline}**, the right wing disc-jockeys ho m**[ake jokes
about beating up illegal immigrants]{.underline}**, and the
\"scholarly\" best-selling books like Alien Nation that warn
\"Americans\" that their loose immigration laws will forever alter the
racial make-up of the U.S. if left unchecked, and that altering our
racial identity will have the dire consequences of undermining the basic
cultural and democratic values that make the U.S. what it is. Another
feature of nativism is its use to justify claims of differential rights
for various minority groups. In my view, **[there is no question that
African Americans]{.underline}** **[together with American Indians have
a moral claim on this country larger than any group]{.underline}**,
**[and that the redress]{.underline}** made **[thus far]{.underline}**
**[is completely inadequate toward repairing the present inequities that
persist as a legacy of]{.underline}** past state-organized **[mass
atrocities]{.underline}**. Some may believe that a kind of nativist
argument would provide further justification for these legitimate claims
to redress, on the grounds that these groups\' forbears were here longer
and/or their labor and ingenuity contributed a great deal to the wealth
of this country. More recent immigrants, it may be thought, \"deserve\"
less by way of protected opportunities or government assist ance. **[The
issue of nativism is thus important to address in relation to the
differences and potential conflicts among communities of color, since
many Asian Americans and Latino/as are post-1965
immigrants]{.underline}** (when the restrictions on immigration based on
geography were lifted). One might well ask, what is wrong with nativist
arguments, and is the critique of nativism based ultimately on group
self-interest?

On December 2, 2016, US president-elect Donald **[[Trump tweeted that

defended himself with these wry complaints: "**[[Interesting how the
U.S. sells Taiwan billions]{.mark} of dollars [of military equipment but

"Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard

gaffe, [Trump's tweets unwittingly reveal Taiwan to be "an American
frontier]{.mark}]{.underline}**," to borrow the words of the
long-forgotten George Kerr, US diplomat and military adviser posted
there in the 1940s, who proposed to restructure Taiwan under US
guidance, in effect creating an "accidental state" on the island.2
Wedged between the United States and China, since the Cold War
days **[[this Pacific island-nation has been positioned as a bargaining
chip in the great power politics]{.mark}: released from Japanese
colonial rule in 1945, [it has]{.mark} since [been un/willingly framed

opposite of the "subhuman, inhuman, and humanly unthinkable
China]{.mark}"]{.underline}** **[[that allegedly threatens
American happiness and greatness]{.underline}]{.mark}**.3 As a US--China
frontier and a military borderland emerging out of Han-Chinese settler
colonialism, Japan's colonial scheme for advancing to Southeast Asia,
and US Pacific imperial cartography,4 Taiwan's modern formations are
deeply embedded in these transpacific entanglements, yet its
significance has been disavowed and absented---indeed, it serves a space
of exception that, as US media are quick to acknowledge, is "perhaps the
most militarily vulnerable US partner anywhere in the world" despite
being a top market for US arms sales in Asia.5 **[Our reason for
invoking Taiwan here is manifold. [As a central "problem" in US--China
relations, Taiwan represents not just a political concern but]{.mark},
more important for American studies scholars, [a methodological
and conceptual inspiration for grappling with the complexities of
"China" in the US global imagination]{.mark}.]{.underline}**6 On the one
hand, **[[the reign of Trumpolitics has rendered
Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[End Page 443\] **[[more visible,
both domestically and internationally, as a space of
exception structurally linked to Guantánamo, Abu Ghraib,
and Okinawa that are subjected to the regime of
extraterritoriality, which is the norm---not exception---to postwar
American empire]{.underline}]{.mark}**.7 While Taiwan is neither an
incarceral space nor a host of a US military base now, itsreliance on US
protection and increasing economic integration with China has locked
itself in a state of "in/dependence," a
conundrum that pessimists have predicted would be resolved only by war.8
On the other hand, **[[the way Taiwan has been fronted by Trump as a
bargaining chip reveals]{.mark} how large China looms in the US global
imaginary now and [how central maintaining and managing the Pacific and
other frontiers still is to the project of US
imperialism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. On a more personal level, as two
Americanists with roots in Taiwan, we hope to better comprehend these
entangled, conflicting spaces and politics, with Japan, Korea, the
Pacific islands, and Southeast Asia deeply implicated in complex
transpacific dynamism. Against the tired tropes of orientalism and Cold
War divisions, we hope to initiate dialogue between the rich field
of transpacific studies and inter-Asia critique as we strive to imagine
more capacious and self-critical approaches to the "global" in American
studies. **[[Today, US--China relations are increasingly characterized
by competition, collusion, complicity, and even collaboration on the
global scale rather than simply domination and resistanceon the Pacific
front.]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[Through rearticulating frontier spaces

Today In his statements about Taiwan, **[Kerr characterizes Taiwan as
"[a trouble spot" where the "two frontiers \[American and Chinese\] meet
and overlap]{.mark}," and considered its national formation similar to
the American experience, [as a frontier nation settled by "hardy
pioneers]{.mark}, bold and adventurous]{.underline}**."9 Kerr's
allusion to Frederick Jackson Turner's frontier thesis, especially the
analogous relation that he draws between Taiwan and the United States,
urges us to consider state formations, including postcolonial ones in
Taiwan and elsewhere, as inherently settler colonial projects. As both
Turner's thesis and growing scholarship on US settler colonialism make
clear, **[[Euro-American settlement, made possible by the genocide and
dispossession of indigenous]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[peoples,created the conditions for racial capitalism and liberal
democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}**.10 **[[In this context, frontier

paper currency and]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[End Page 444\] **[[wild-cat
banking" go hand in hand with racism, war, genocide, and the
dispossession of native land]{.underline}]{.mark}**.11 The frontier in
the American mind is thus also a space of danger and opportunity that
elicits excitement, caution, and opportunisticcalculation: it is
something to annex or maintain control when profitable, and to leave
behind if the costs outweigh benefits. **[[As the playground of imperial
white masculinity and supremacy, the frontier is inherently a precarious
space; it is also a liminal and impossible space that is haunted,
potentially assimilable, and always disavowed by the imperial
power]{.underline}]{.mark}**.12 In the contemporary context, **[[the
metaphor of frontier helps us identify nodes of contention and spaces of
exception obscured by dominant knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Equally
important, **[[it urges us to move beyond its conventional usage
by activating critical visions and practices that put pressure against
such occlusion, rearticulating frontiers as borderlands where political
and cultural contestations against imperial rivalries and collaborations
point to different political possibilities]{.underline}]{.mark}**.13

inside/outside distinction (Walker 1992) in the Westphalian states
system, there is also an inner/outer aspect to the Confucianism-informed
tribute system. However, what is considered close/near or distant/far in
the latter follows a logic different from that of the former. As Wang
Hui (2011, 235) has noted, the tribute system allows a 'significant
degree of ambivalence and flexibility between inner and outer', whereas
**[[the principles of Westphalian sovereignty require a clearer
demarcation between inside and outside, producing 'an absolute
opposition between independence and unification, with no inbetween grey
area allowed']{.mark}.]{.underline}** Although such ambivalence and
flexibility had enabled Ming--Qing China and Tokugawa Japan to maintain
peaceful relations over Ryukyu for more than two-and-a-half centuries,
the existence of this grey area was increasingly hard to tolerate for
the new Meiji government. To borrow from Fukuzawa Yukichi's well-known
remarks, **[[it was imperative for the 'half-civilized' Japan not to be
mistaken as another China or Korea by the European imperialist
powers.]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[Meiji leaders and intellectuals
started narrating their Asian neighbours in the light of
Westphalian]{.mark} international [law so as to present their nation as
equal to the European powers]{.mark}, [and, in so doing, turned
themselves into imperialists]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Myers and Peattie,
1987). In December 1871, **[[54 out of 66 Ryukyuan survivors of a
shipwreck accident in southern Taiwan were killed by the aboriginal
Kuskus tribe]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The remaining survivors were
rescued and compensated by local residents and Qing officials, and they
were escorted to Ryukyu's trading mission in Fuzhou and later back to
Naha in July 1872. **[While shipwrecks and similar incidents in this
area were not uncommon in the nineteenth century, [this tragedy was
appropriated by the Meiji government to reinforce its sovereignty claim
to Ryukyu]{.mark}]{.underline}**. When Yanagiwara Sakimitsu (who later
became Japan's minister to China) was sent to question Zongli Yamen (the
foreign affairs office of the late Qing dynasty) ministers Mao Changxi
and Dong Xun about the killings, his Chinese counterparts replied that
'**[[there are two kinds of savages on this island. One type has come
under our rule, which we called "ripe savages", and the other is beyond
our influence, and we have no means of controlling
them]{.underline}]{.mark}**' (cited in Suzuki 2008, 150); **[[since 'all
the murderers are "\[raw\] savages", so we regard them as beyond the
reach of civilizing, and thus difficult to rule
properly']{.underline}]{.mark}** (cited in Wang 2011, 236). The Qing
officials were merely stating that some 'savages' at that time were
beyond China's influence (and thus the Qing court was not liable for
their wrongdoing); the highly flexible inner/outer distinctions actually
meant that 'raw savages' could become part of China once they accepted
Confucian teaching. For Yanagiwara, the aforementioned admission that
some Taiwanese aborigines were outside Chinese influence indicated that
**[[some parts of Taiwan might not be within Chinese sovereignty, and
thus might be open to colonial conquest: 'Taiwan was in danger of being
occupied by foreign powers wanting to punish the savages]{.mark} ...
posing a threat to our southern waters and islands.]{.underline}** For
this reason, we are preparing to send an expedition \[to Taiwan\]
immediately' (cited in Suzuki 2008, 151). In the aftermath of the 1874
Taiwan Expedition---the first overseas use of force by the Meiji
government---a treaty was concluded to end the standoff between China
and Japan, and Qing officials accepted that the expedition was a 'just
act' to redress the grievance of 'Japanese citizens' who were 'wantonly
harmed' by Taiwanese aborigines. **[[Japan speeded up the process of
eliminating the 'grey area' by prohibiting Ryukyu from sending tributary
missions to China in 1875 and eventually turned it into Okinawa
Prefecture in 1879]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The Mudanshe Incident
likewise prompted the Qing to strengthen its administration in southern
Taiwan and its controls over the aborigines, a step towards place the
entire island under Chinese sovereignty in accordance with the
Westphalian standard (Lin 2006). Narrating Ryukyu as an integral part of
Japan's sovereign territories was not without resistance. Ryukyuan
officials were among the first to urge the Meiji government not to
disrupt the existing Qing--Ryukyu rescue assistance mechanism and
refused to justify the Taiwan Expedition by withholding a memorial
service for the deceased Ryukyuans. **[[Following the termination of
tributary relations with China and the abolition of the kingdom]{.mark},
Ryukyuan envoys to Beijing frequently petitioned Zongli Yamen and
carried out hunger strikes calling for China's
intervention]{.underline}**. In protest against a pending treaty between
the Qing court and Japan whose ratification would lead to the partition
of Ryukyu,1 one of these envoys, Rin Shiko, went so far as to commit
sui- cide (Hiyane 2015). Although Rin's hope to restore the kingdom
through external interventions diminished following China's defeat in
the First SinoJapanese War, the fact that the Japanese state had to
continue its consumption of the Botansha Incident decades after the
establishment of Okinawa Prefecture in the construction of Ryukyuans'
Japanese identity reaffirms **[[Foucault's observation that where there
are social interactions, there are relations of power which traverse
what is happening and produce effects unexpected by those seeking to
dominate.]{.mark} [An example of such consumption is the relocation of
the victims' graveyard to downtown Naha in 1899]{.mark}. [Rather than
offering]{.mark} his [prayer]{.mark} for them or expressing his sorrow,
Okinawa Governor Narahara [Shigeru]{.mark} in the epitaph [only
described]{.mark} the [victimization]{.mark} of 54 Okinawans in Taiwan
and the heroic action of the imperial military in punishing the crime
committed by the villains]{.underline}** (Matayoshi 2018, 278). In the
first memorial ceremony (and those that followed on 4 April annually as
a prefectural event), Narahara praised the Taiwan Expedition (which led
to Taiwan's eventual annexation and turned those savages into 'Japan's
slaves') and stressed that his audience shoud 'contribute to the
country' (Matayoshi 2018 279). The discursive construction of Taiwan as
an 'undeveloped land' (mikai no ji) and a 'demons' island' (oni ga
shima), and of Taiwanese aborigines as 'headhunters' (kubikarizoku) and
'barbaric savages' (yaban), started to take root in Okinawa (Matayoshi
2018), which worked to justify Japan's colonization of Taiwan and (as
will be discussed later) to create hierarchy among those at the margins
of the Japanese empire. **[[If the Taiwanese aborigines are represented
as barbaric and backward in the Meiji Japanese
narratives]{.underline}]{.mark}**, those of the history textbooks
approved by the ROC and the PRC are resolved and vigorous. **[[Both
narrate the Mudanshe Incident as modern Japan's first armed invasion of
Taiwan as a violation of Chinese sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(Satoi 2006; Sung and Wu 2013).2 The instruction manual of the
second-grade junior high school Chinese history textbook (2002 edition)
edited by the Eastern China Normal University, for example, describes
that Taiwan had belonged to Fukien Province since Emperor Kangxi's
'retaking' of Taiwan from Koxinga's successors; moreover, its 'rich
resources' and 'important strategic location' made it a target for
Western colonial powers (Satoi 2006, 59--60). The US was said to have
territorial ambitions on Chinese Taiwan as early as the 1840s and,
following an 1867 shipwreck incident in southern Taiwan and the killing
of its seven remaining members of crew, the US Navy dispatched 181
marines to Hengchun, only to be 'expelled by Taiwanese people'. And
Japan allegedly imitated this approach to invade Taiwan (Satoi 2006).
**[The Chinese possession of Taiwan's sovereignty is narrated as a
naturalized and timeless fact, and the contemporary PRC--US--Japan great
power rivalry is projected back to the nineteenth century. Similarly,
several junior and senior high school history textbooks published in
Taiwan highlight aboriginal tribes' 'fierce resistance'. The 2003
edition published by Chienhong specifically praises aborigines' 'heroic
resistance', which 'eventually secured \[Chinese\] sovereignty over
Taiwan']{.underline}** (Satoi 2006, 63). **[[Narrating them as patriotic
warriors is not only anachronistic]{.underline}]{.mark}** (throughout
Qing rule the notion of citizenship never took root in Taiwan); **[[it
also glosses over the fact that the same people were considered 'raw
savages' by Qing officials.]{.mark} [Dominant as these mainstream
state-centric representational practices may appear, counter-narratives
generated by members of the relevant local communities and beyond have
been emerging, reminding us that where there is power, there is
resistance]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Edkins 2019). For instance, Hua
A-tsai (aboriginal name: Valjluk Mavaliu) collects accounts of the
unfortunate encounter between the Kuskus tribe and Ryukyuan shipwreck
survivors from local (Kuskus) perspectives. Contrary to the barbaric
'headhunter' image in mainstream narratives, Hua argues that Ryukyuans
were provided with food, water and shelter by the tribe upon their
arrival, and the tragedy occurred only after they escaped at night,
which was seen as an insult to the host (Miyaoka 2017, 299). In her oral
history research Kao Chia-hsing (Lianes Punanang) maintains that, from
the locals' standpoint, it was the intruders' violation of their
traditional customs and communal laws combined with miscommunication
that led to the tragedy. Furthermore, the Mudanshe Incident did not end
with Japan's victory'; it was heavy casualties on both sides that pushed
them to end the state of belligerence. **[[Rather than representing a
shameful episode in Taiwan's modern history, for Kao, Sinvaudjan
ancestors succeeded in defending the aboriginal community and earned
their honour]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Kao 2008a; 2008b). **[[Their
counternarratives seek to turn some historical baggage into an
educational and tourism resource that reconnects local residents with
various actors in Taiwan and Okinawa.]{.underline}]{.mark}** These
include exhibitions and symposiums, dance and stage plays, picture
books, meetings with the victims' offspring to seek reconciliation, and
a memorial park that expresses remorse for the Ryukyuan victims and pays
respect to the ancestors who died defending the homeland (authors' field
visit, 19 March 2018; Miyaoka 2017). Considering the emergence of
various 'history issues' that have plagued relations among East Asian
states since the end of the Cold War (Gustafsson 2014), such
reconciliation efforts by and between the margins merit more systematic
attention in IR (for a recent example in anthropology, see Kamizuru et
al 2017). The next section will turn to how narrative power operates in
the headline-catching Sino-Japanese island dispute and to what effect.

3.4 **[[Daoist trialectics]{.mark}]{.underline}** The Daodejing (Classic
of the Way) **[[posits two ontologically equal
opposites]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- yin (the female principle, colored
in black) and yang (the male principle, colored in white). **[[Each
faces the other with internal entwinements in
tow]{.underline}]{.mark}**: that is, **[[yin-within-yang,
yang-within-yin.]{.mark}]{.underline}** 17 Graphically, an S-like border
differentiates the white sphere-yin from the black-yang. Their internal
entwinements show up as a white dot in the black sphere, and a black dot
in the white. **[[Daoist yin/yang relations thus encompass simultaneous
interaction between the two principals and their internal
entwinements.]{.underline}]{.mark}**18 Together, **[these account for
[continuity and change, connections and conflicts, masculinity and
femininity, duality and non-duality]{.mark}]{.underline}**.19 Systemic
health, by extension, requires balance among contending, opposing forces
through their mutual embeddedness. Water exemplifies the dao. 'The
highest efficacy', the Daodejing quotes Laozi,20 'is like water' (Ames
and Hall, 2003, p. 87). Endowed with inherently transformative
capabilities, water can turn from hot to cold, soft to hard, or calm to
stormy at a moment's notice. Water also swishes in a multi-layered,
multi-dimensional milieu. Flowing from centers to margins, depths to
surfaces, and back again, water dwells in places 'loathed by the crowd'
as well as loved by it (Ames and Hall, 2003, p. 87). Despite being a
porous, malleable substance, water can break rocks. 'The meekest in the
world/Penetrates the strongest in the world' (Laozi quoted in Thompson,
1998, p. 17). The dao, accordingly, never discriminates between the
yin-female principle and the yang-male principle. Each has its time,
place, and circumstance. Water thus reminds the powerful and the weak
alike not to presume too much. Power seems eternal -- until it is washed
away, flooded by the undeniable life-force that is water. It evidences,
in short, the futility of control. For this reason, daoism teaches that
the highest ideal of social action for the individual and the collective
is wuwei or non-coercive action.21 Continuing with the metaphor of water
breaking rocks, Laozi notes its implications: As nothingness \[water\]
enters into that-which-has-no-opening, Hence, I am aware of the value of
non-action \[wuwei\] And of the value of teaching with no-words. As for
the value of non-action \[non-coercion\], Nothing in the world can match
it (Laozi quoted in Thompson, 1998, p. 17). 3.5 **[Non-duality with
duality]{.underline}** One example comes from Zen Buddhism's non-duality
with duality. **[[Non-duality refers to a condition whereby 'subject and
object are not opposed to each other, the one excluding the
other']{.underline}]{.mark}** (Hori, 2003, p. 15). Still, non-duality
cannot eliminate duality; otherwise, non-duality itself would impose
another kind of duality. Japanese Zen master Eihei
**[Dogen]{.underline}** (1200--1253) **[identifies [a trialectic of
thinking to facilitate non- duality with duality]{.mark}]{.underline}**:
thinking (shiryo), not-thinking (fushiryo), and non-thinking (hishiryo).
**[[Transitioning from one to the other helps the mind journey from the
conventional to the ineffable.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Dogen cites this
example: An ancient Buddha said: 'Mountains mountain, waters water.'
These words don't say that 'mountains' are mountains, they say that
mountains mountain. This being the case, we should study 'mountains.'
When we investigate mountains in this way, mountains mountain (Dogen
quoted in Tanaka, 2013, p. 326). In other words, Dogen exhorts us to
remove the self when considering others, including that which may seem
inanimate. **[[When we think of mountains as 'mountains' only, then we
are prioritizing ourselves]{.mark} -- that is, [our preconceived notion
of a mountain -- in our understanding of it]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To
not think about the mountain, in turn, would erase something that
obviously exists. Both cases would violate the mountain. But **[[when we
perceive that a mountain mountains, we begin to relate to it on its own
terms and in its own context]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[We are entering
the realm of nonthinking. We begin to experience the
mountain]{.underline}**.22 In this way, we emancipate ourselves from
preconceptions or other normalized ways of thinking. We begin to realize
the world as it seeks/needs to be realized and our (minuscule) role in
it. Buddhism's **[five-rank protocol specifies a method for [integrating
nonduality with duality]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The first two ranks --
(i) [**[recognizing 'the relative within the absolute']{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} (ii) '[**[the absolute within the
relative]{.underline}**']{.mark} -- caution, in effect, that appearances
can be deceiving. **[[Things]{.mark} may seem different on the
surface]{.underline}** (e.g., yin versus yang) **[but they [share a
common condition or essence underneath]{.mark}]{.underline}** (e.g.,
yin-within-yang, yang-within-yin). Even so, the commonality between
different things does not negate each entity's unique qualities (e.g.,
yin is still the female principle; yang, the male). From these two
ranks, the third one -- (iii) '**[[coming from within the
absolute']{.underline}]{.mark}** -- **[[becomes
possible]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Here, we begin to see and treat the two
parts, relative (e.g., yin) and absolute (e.g., yang), as one (e.g., the
dao). From this basis, compassion arises and enlightenment becomes a
possibility. A fourth rank -- (iv) '**[[arriving at mutual integration'
-- urges action]{.mark} [based on this insight]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
'At this stage, the absolute and relative are integrated, but they're
still two things' (Loori, 2009, p. xxvii). For this reason, we need a
fifth rank -- (v) 'unity attained' -- to affirm '\[t\]here is no more
duality. \[The entity\] is one thing -- neither absolute nor relative,
up nor down, profane nor holy, good nor bad, male nor female' (Loori,
2009, p. xxvii). From thinking to not-thinking, we reach Dogen's
non-thinking or wuwei. **[[So with advaitic-daoist
IR]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Integrated into a post-Westphalian,
postdichotomous IR**[[, it urges engagement with hegemonic conventions
like 'China' versus the 'West']{.mark}]{.underline}** with the
'ever-transient' yet 'perpetually connected' nature of our
world-of-worlds. Otherwise, where would systemic transformation come
from? Buddhism's five-rank protocol helps us excavate 'the hidden
connectedness across diversities'. **[[We witness, accordingly, the
making of our world-of-worlds by different actors and communities in
their local and global contexts]{.underline}]{.mark}**. More pointedly,
an advantic-daoist IR adds one more element: spirituality.
