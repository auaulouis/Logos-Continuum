### Counterfactuals

#### Counterfactual engagement improves contingent judgement and decision making -- hindsight bias ignores contingencies and alternate histories

**Lebow 1** (Richard Lebow, "What's so Different about a
Counterfactual?", World Politics. Vol. 52. No. 4. July 2000,
 <http://www.jstor.org/stable/25054129>)\\\\AK

The disciplinary tendency to privilege structural explanations is re
inforced by the \"certainty of hindsight bias.\"23 Baruch Fischoff has
demonstrated that \"outcome knowledge\" affects our understanding of the
past by making it difficult for us to recall that we were once unsure
about what was going to happen. [Events deemed improbable by experts
(]{.mark}for example, peace between Egypt and Israel, the end of the
cold war[) are often considered \"overdetermined\"]{.mark} and all but
inevitable after they have occurred.24 [By tracing the path]{.mark} that
appears to have led to a known outcome, [we diminish our sensitivity to
alternative paths]{.mark} and outcomes. We may fail to recognize the
uncertainty under which actors operated and the possibility that they
could have made different choices that might have led to different
outcomes. Many psychologists regard the certainty-of-hindsight effect as
deeply rooted and difficult to overcome. But the [experimental
literature suggests that counterfactual intervention can assist people
in retrieving and making explicit their]{.mark} massive but largely
latent [uncertainty about historical junctures,]{.mark} that is, to
recognize that they once thought, per haps correctly, that events could
easily have taken a different turn. [The proposed correctives use one
cognitive bias to reduce the effect of an other]{.mark}. Ross et al.
exploited the tendency of people to inflate the per ceived likelihood of
vivid scenarios to make them more responsive to contingency. [People who
were presented with scenarios describing pos sible life histories of
post-therapy patients evaluated these possibilities as more likely than
did members of the control group who were not given the
scenarios]{.mark}. This effect persisted even when all the participants
in the experiment were told that the post-therapy scenarios were en
tirely hypothetical.25 Philip E. Tetlock and the author conducted a
series of experiments to test the extent to which counterfactual un
packing leads foreign policy experts to upgrade the contingency of in
ternational crises. In the first experiment one group of experts was
asked to assess the inevitability of the Cuban missile crisis. A second
group was asked the same questions but was given three junctures at
which the course of the crisis might have taken a different turn. A
third group was given the same three junctures and, in addition, three
argu ments for why each of them was plausible[. Judgments of contingency
varied in proportion to the degree of counterfactual
unpacking]{.mark}.26 There is every reason to expect that [scholars
exposed to counterfactuals]{.mark} and, better yet, forced to grapple
with their theoretical [consequences will also become more open to the
role of contingency i]{.mark}n key decisions and events.

[This year Congress is **expected to pass**]{.underline} [a piece of
legislation that deeply affects the lives of all Americans and
**determines** the **strategic positioning** of the **U**nited
**S**tates in **global ag**riculture]{.underline} for the next five
years. The Farm Bill influences the food we eat, how we grow it, and the
lives of the farmers who do so. [Funding for
**ag**]{.underline}ricultural research and development
(**[[R&D]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [only makes up a **tiny sliver** of the
Farm Bill's budget]{.underline}---about 0.2 percent in the 2014
bill---[but]{.underline} it [[has **profound consequences** for]{.mark}
U.S. agricultural competitiveness and **[global food
security]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The United States has historically been
at the forefront of agricultural science and innovation, but our
leadership is slipping: China has been outspending us 2 to 1 on
agricultural research since 2013. Q1: What is the Farm Bill, and what
does it have to do with agricultural research and development? A1: The
first Farm Bill was dominated by farm support programs meant to ease the
blow of the Great Depression. Since then it has evolved into an enormous
omnibus bill that addresses a wide range of issues, spanning nutrition
assistance, rural development, international food aid, and more. The
legislation falls under the jurisdiction of the House and Senate
Agriculture Committees and sparks strong opinions from diverse interest
groups ranging from maritime unions to commodity associations. The 2014
Farm Bill authorized a projected \$489 billion in mandatory federal
spending between 2014 and 2018. Just four of the bill's 12
titles---nutrition, crop insurance, conservation, and farm commodity
support---make up 99 percent of its mandatory authorizations. Funded at
over \$390 billion, nutrition programming alone accounts for roughly 80
percent of the budget, with the bulk of this funding earmarked for the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), previously known as
food stamps. In comparison, the portion of the bill that supports
agricultural research and extension received \$800 million over five
years. Despite this small share, [these [funds determine]{.mark}
priorities for **ag**ricultural **[science]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[related to **crop diseases**]{.mark} and **pests**]{.underline}, farm
**[[animal health]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [natural [**resource
management**,]{.mark} [**food safety**, **nutrition**, and]{.mark}
countless [other areas **critical** to]{.mark} U.S. agricultural and
**[food systems]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [The]{.underline}]{.mark} [Farm
[Bill is the **primary**]{.mark} **source** of federal [**funding** for
**ag**]{.mark}**ricultural [science]{.mark}**]{.underline}. With these
resources, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) funds the work of
its three in-house research agencies---the Agricultural Research
Service, the Economic Research Service, and the National Agricultural
Statistics Service---as well as its extramural research wing, the
National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which funds research through
land-grant universities, state agricultural experiment stations, and
other institutions at the state and local levels. The 2014 Farm Bill
also authorized \$200 million to establish the nonprofit Foundation for
Food and Agriculture Research, which matches federal funding with
private-sector donations to award grants for public-private
collaborative research partnerships. Q2: What are the trends in U.S.
public investment in agricultural R&D that impact our leadership
position? A2: Despite a 40 percent return on investment, growth in U.S.
public-sector funding for agricultural R&D slowed in the early 1980s,
flatlined in the 1990s, and turned negative as of 2011.
Inflation-adjusted public investments in agricultural R&D fell by 20
percent between 2008 and 2013. These trends are troubling on their own
but even more so in light of the global context. As the United States
steadily chipped away at agricultural research funding, rapidly growing
economies---like China, India, and Brazil---did the opposite. As a
result of these inverse patterns, the U.S. share of global public
agricultural R&D investments fell by nearly half between 1960 and 2011,
from 20 percent to 11 percent. Meanwhile, China ramped up spending
almost eightfold between 1990 and 2013, overtaking the United States as
the biggest investor in public agricultural R&D in 2008. U.S. federal
funding for agricultural science has also deteriorated relative to other
research areas. In 2012, the National Institutes of Health (one of the
foremost federal biomedical research centers in the world) outspent USDA
nearly 15 to 1 on research and development. There is no question that
human health is a high priority for R&D dollars, but ensuring an
adequate, healthy, and safe food supply plays a critical part in
improving health outcomes. Q3: Why is public agricultural R&D important
for U.S. agriculture? A3: American agriculture is competitive because it
is productive. U.S. agricultural output grew by a staggering 268 percent
from 1949 to 2007. Expanded agricultural production was due almost
entirely to productivity growth, a metric for how efficiently inputs
(land, labor, and other resources) are turned into outputs (crop and
livestock yields), rather than an expansion of our agricultural
footprint. [[R&D]{.underline}]{.mark}, paired with systems that bring
discoveries from the laboratory to the field, [[is the **principal
driver** of productivity]{.mark} growth]{.underline}. American farmers
have benefited from a flood of breakthrough technologies and
innovations---like high-yielding, drought-tolerant seeds and more
efficient equipment---that have transformed farming as we know it. They
have experienced first-hand how investments in public R&D can allow them
to maintain their competitive edge both at home and abroad. Expanded
output also suppresses consumer food prices, with particular benefits
for low-income households, who typically spend a greater share of their
income on food. U.S. annual agricultural productivity growth peaked at a
rate of about 2 percent in the mid-1980s and has been slowing ever
since. [This is **especially concerning** [in the face of]{.mark}
**global agriculture's** myriad **new challenges**: **[climate
change]{.mark}**, [unfamiliar]{.mark} **pests** and [**diseases**, and
**rising**]{.mark} **production [costs]{.mark}**, to name a few. Given
such threats, **[U.S. ag]{.mark}**riculture [will require "**maintenance
research**]{.mark}" just to **sustain current** levels of
**productivity**, let alone boost yields]{.underline}. With continued
public-sector R&D divestment, slumping productivity growth is likely to
persist. Stagnant productivity has negative implications beyond our
domestic food supply. In the long term, losing ground on investments in
agricultural R&D to other countries means losing our competitive edge to
them, too. Failing to invest in the next generation of scientists would
hamstring our scientific workforce well into the future, further
diminishing our long-run leadership in global agricultural research.
America's competitive advantage is rooted in being on the cutting edge
of scientific discovery. Q4: What are the global implications of U.S.
agricultural R&D? A4: [[The **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [has
long been a **leader** in]{.mark} advancing the frontier of
**[ag]{.mark}**ricultural **[science]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [American
scientists]{.underline}---often in partnership with international
research institutions like CGIAR---[tackle issues relevant to both
domestic and **global ag**riculture]{.underline}. [Transformative
techniques and [innovations]{.mark} born of this research
**[flow]{.mark} from the U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[[to the **rest of the world**]{.underline}. [In **poor
countries**]{.underline}]{.mark} [that cannot afford to undertake their
own agricultural research, [these]{.mark} discoveries [help farmers **do
more with less**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [When U.S. agricultural
scientists partner internationally, it often produces **dual wins** for
both **domestic** and **global stakeholders**]{.underline}. For example,
in the last decade, USDA-funded scientists worked in collaboration with
international researchers to address a virulent wheat stem rust, Ug99,
which wrought havoc on wheat yields across Africa and Asia. Eighty
percent of the global wheat supply was vulnerable to Ug99, including
U.S. production, posing a potentially devastating threat to global food
security (wheat accounts for 20 percent of calories consumed globally).
But by using CGIAR breeding lines, scientists stopped the spread of the
disease. By partnering with scientists internationally to address global
challenges like wheat rust, [[the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[safeguards]{.underline}]{.mark}**
domestic **[agriculture]{.underline}** [against **future
threats**]{.underline}, [[while]{.underline}]{.mark} simultaneously
[**[bolstering resilience]{.underline}** [and **productivity** **around
the world**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Consumption growth coupled with
dietary changes driven by increased incomes will boost demand for
agricultural products from 60 percent to over 110 percent in the coming
decades. [Agricultural productivity growth is key to satisfying this
rising demand, but it must be harnessed in a **sustainable manner** to
safeguard the environment]{.underline}. However, productivity growth is
not on course to meet forecasted demands and is especially lagging in
developing countries, where population and consumption growth is
concentrated. [[Increased]{.mark} investments in agricultural [**R&D**
and **knowledge transfer**]{.mark} systems [will]{.mark} [be
**essential** to]{.mark} **ensure [food security]{.mark}** [in the
**developing world**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The **Farm Bill**
could]{.underline}]{.mark} [help to [**chart** a]{.mark} **more [food
secure future]{.mark}** [by fostering **international**]{.mark}
**research [collaboration]{.mark}** that supports the strategic
interests of both the United States and our partners]{.underline}. For
example, Section 1402 of the Farm Bill, which covers agricultural
research, extension, and education, could be enhanced by adding language
that incentivizes international scientific collaboration through USDA.
The ***[Lugar]{.underline}*** Center ***[agrees]{.underline}***. The
first point in its Principles for Public Investments in Agriculture
Sciences, published this week, states "both domestic and international
research need to work together on common goals."

of [these]{.mark} elements [will be triggered by]{.mark} competition

2008]{.underline}. [The rapid increase in grain prices and prevailing
food insecurity in many states is linked to the outbreak of protests,
food riots and the **breakdown of governance**]{.underline}. [Widespread
food insecurity is a driving factor in creating a disaffected population

food]{.underline}]{.mark} and water [[security]{.underline}]{.mark} and

### Turns Case -- Inequality

**Resource wars massively increases inequality.**

**Ballard '17** (Charles L. Ballard, a professor at Michigan State
University\'s Department of Economics where he specializes in
econometric analysis of trends in income inequality in different regions
of the United States. "Many of Trump\'s policies will further intensify
income inequality"
<http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/economy-budget/318941-many-of-trumps-policies-will-further-intensify-income>
)

On a per-capita basis, the U.S. economy is more than twice as large as
it was in 1973. But the average man, who works full time, year-round,
earns less now than in 1973, after adjusting for inflation. [Meanwhile,
the share of income going to the most affluent one percent of American
households has skyrocketed]{.underline} from about nine percent in the
1970s to more than 20 percent in recent years. That's a redistribution
of more than one trillion dollars per year. [This unprecedented
disconnect between the average family and those at the top of the
economic pile has generated tremendous discontent. Both]{.underline}
Donald [Trump and]{.underline} Bernie [Sanders tapped into that
discontent during the 2016 presidential campaign. Since [Trump]{.mark}
has now moved from campaign rhetoric to policy making, this is a good
time to assess which of his policies are likely to help working
American]{.underline}s, and which are likely to hurt. Trump's appeal to
working Americans has overwhelmingly emphasized the effects of import
competition and immigration. This has clearly been effective
politically, but the economics behind these arguments are another story.
It is certainly true that many American workers have suffered from
import competition and/or immigration. However, other factors are more
important than either imports or immigration, in terms of explaining the
rise of inequality. On the campaign trail, job losses in the American
manufacturing sector are often blamed exclusively on imports, but
changing technologies actually play a bigger role. In yesterday's
factory, large numbers of workers performed simple, repetitive tasks.
Today, computer-driven robots do a lot of the work. Also, some
[**proposed "[solutions]{.mark}" run the risk of [mak]{.mark}ing [things
worse]{.mark}**. If we slap high tariffs on imports, history suggests
that other countries will retaliate by imposing tariffs on American
exports.]{.underline} Based on the campaign rhetoric, it would be easy
to conclude that trade is strictly a one-way street. In fact, American
exports are substantially more than \$2 trillion per year. A [full-scale
[trade war could lead to a]{.mark} global [recession]{.mark}, and that's
not good for American workers. Finally, it's worth noting that
**[tariffs raise prices for]{.mark} American [consumers]{.mark}**. When
we look to other, more important sources of rising inequality, the
**[Trump]{.mark}** administration **[appears]{.mark} likely
[to]{.mark}** do little, or to **[push for policies that]{.mark} will
[exacerbate the divergence between]{.mark} those at [the top]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} those in the **middle and** at [the **bottom**]{.mark}**.**
One of the biggest sources of increased income inequality is the
financialization of the U.S. economy]{.underline}, described in Rana
Foroohar's excellent book, \"Makers and Takers.\" Deregulation of the
financial-services sector transferred trillions of dollars to a small
number of financiers, and it set the stage for the worst economic
downturn since the Great Depression. [The Dodd-Frank bill,]{.underline}
while imperfect, [established some common-sense protections for
consumers, and it reduced the risk of another financial crisis. The
[Trump]{.mark} administration **[appears eager to rip out]{.mark}** much
of **[Dodd-Frank]{.mark}**. This will be fabulous for Wall
Street]{.underline}, at least for a while, but the average citizen could
be forgiven for wondering what's in it for him or her. If enough
regulations are removed, [**[another financial crisis will
become]{.mark}** nearly **[inevitable]{.mark}**]{.underline}, although
it's hard to predict when it will hit. [When it comes, a repeat of the
meltdown of 2008-09 won't be good for the average American. Another
major source of rising income inequality is that the education and
skills of American workers have not kept pace with changing
technologies.]{.underline} In the economist's jargon, the demand for
highly skilled labor has grown faster than the supply of highly skilled
labor. [Judging from Mr. Trump's appointments in education, it appears
that the next few years will be good for private, religious, and
for-profit schools. Unfortunately, there is little reason to believe
that this will produce much benefit for the next generation of American
workers.]{.underline} Mr. [Trump campaigned for a major income-tax
cut.]{.underline} Most taxpayers would receive a modest tax cut, but
**[the biggest reductions --- by far --- would be for the most
affluent]{.underline}**. The top one-tenth of one percent would see
their taxes slashed by about \$1.1 million per year, on average. Mr.
[[Trump's tax plan would]{.mark} also eliminate the estate tax,
providing a windfall for the wealthiest two-tenths of one percent of the
population.]{.underline} Income inequality decreased dramatically in the
middle decades of the 20th century, largely as a result of policies that
were designed to help the bottom 99 percent of the population more than
the top one percent. Those policies included strong support for
education, a highly progressive tax system, strong financial
regulations, protections for labor unions, and the minimum wage. Income
inequality has increased in the last 40 years, largely because earlier
policies were diluted or reversed. So far, the [**main thrust of policy
proposals from President Trump is to** maintain, and even
**[accelerate]{.mark},** the **[anti-egalitarian policies]{.mark}** of
recent decades.]{.underline}

[[The shift]{.mark} in the House of Representatives from Republican to
Democratic control [may give House Agriculture Committee Chair Mike
Conaway an additional incentive to try to shepherd the farm bill]{.mark}
through the lame-duck session of Congress.]{.underline} To do that would
certainly involve a compromise with the Senate over increasing work and
work-reporting requirements for SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program---formerly known as food stamps) benefits. [The shift certainly
gives Ranking Member Collin [Peterson and Democrats more leverage in
making that change]{.mark}.]{.underline} The changes to SNAP proposed by
the legislation before the House would affect all able-bodied adults
18-59 years old who are not caring for a pre-school child. The rationale
for these cuts was made clear by Ag Secretary Sonny Perdue when he told
reporters that SNAP was "supposed to be a hand-up, not a continual
dependency." To continue to receive SNAP benefits, those affected by
this legislation would have to engage in a combination of work and job
training totaling 20 hours per week beginning with fiscal year 2021. The
number of hours per week increases to 25 beginning in fiscal year 2026.
In addition, they would have to report their hours on a weekly basis.
Those who violate these requirements would lose their SNAP benefits for
a year and further violations would result in a three-year loss in
benefits. The reality is that a large number of people receiving SNAP
benefits are already employed and would gladly snap up more hours at a
higher wage if they were available. With more working hours, they would
not need SNAP benefits. [In an [Associated Press
report](https://tinyurl.com/ydhop9nc) by Steven Karnowski, [Peterson is
quoted as saying]{.mark}, "There isn't any reason why this thing can't
get done.... [The only thing I care about between now and the end of the
year is getting this farm bill don]{.mark}e." [Conaway]{.mark} has
indicated that he, too, [is committed to completing work on the farm
bill before the new Congress comes into session. Senate Majority Leader
Mitch McConnel has said that]{.mark} one of his [priorities for the
lame-duck session is the passage of the farm bill.]{.mark}]{.underline}
He also indicated that the farm bill will contain a provision legalizing
the growing of hemp. With the exception of the World War II period, the
growing of hemp has been illegal since the adoption of the Marijuana Tax
Act of 1937. Prior to that industrial hemp had been grown in the U.S.
since colonial times. Industrial hemp can be used in the production of
rope, paper, biofuels, textiles, and a wide range of other products.
Hemp could compete with corn, soybeans, and cotton for acreage,
providing a short-term boost to crop prices. Support for limiting SNAP
benefits is not limited to the House of Representatives. The Trump
administration has also called for additional restrictions on SNAP
benefits, raising the possibility that the president might consider
vetoing a farm bill without additional limits on the SNAP program. [Then
again, [the president has yet to veto his first piece of legislation. In
addition, if the farm bill is not adopted during the lame-duck session,
the House Democrats will enjoy increased leverage over the
policies]{.mark}, including SNAP benefits, embedded in any farm bill
adopted in the new Congress that will be seated on January 3, 2019[.
Because rural and agricultural areas overwhelmingly voted for
Republicans in the House of Representatives, farmers may find themselves
with decreased leverage when it comes to policies like payment
limitations, environmental compliance, and other environmental
provisions.]{.mark}]{.underline}

legislation.]{.underline} A Peterson aide on Friday confirmed the Nov.
12 meeting. The House and Senate are scheduled to be back Tuesday. "I

become chairman," Peterson said during a Thursday interview on the North
Dakota-based Adams on Agriculture radio broadcast. "We're going to get
together next Monday, Mike and I. I want to get this thing wrapped up."
[[Negotiators from the two chambers tried to reach a compromise on the
pending farm bill legislation, but negotiations stalled over several
provisions including the GOP demand for expanded work requirements for
people who receive benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program]{.underline}]{.mark}. With the midterm elections handing the
House majority to Democrats, Peterson said he does not think House
Republicans have any bargaining edge to press for expanded work
requirements and other changes to SNAP, formerly known as the food stamp
program. A farm bill with those provisions could not pass the Senate in
the lame duck because of Democratic opposition and a Democratic House in
the 116th Congress would keep them out of a farm bill. "Now \[with\]
what's happened with the election, the leverage, whatever leverage they
did have on the SNAP stuff, I don't see that they have any leverage
anymore," Peterson said. He said he favors cutting back on federal
waivers to states that ease existing work requirements for SNAP
recipients, but Peterson added that he does not think the Senate would
accept such restrictions. Peterson, Conaway and Senate Agriculture
Chairman [Pat
Roberts](https://www.rollcall.com/members?195&utm_source=memberLink?utm_source=memberLink) and

Stabenow](https://www.rollcall.com/members?247&utm_source=memberLink?utm_source=memberLink) left
for recess in October with an agreement to try to have a compromise
ready by Nov. 14. Peterson said it is unclear if they can make the
deadline to resolve differences between their respective 2018 farm
bills. The House and Senate passed bills differ significantly on SNAP
and on the future of a major conservation program and on farm subsidy
payment rules. The 2014 farm bill expired Sept. 30, but major farm
programs for crops and dairy won't begin expiring until December. In the
radio interview, [Peterson said staff from both committees continued to
meet during the recess to resolve differences and the [Congressional
Budget Office provided cost estimates for various proposals. "It's a
matter of making a decision on what will be in a final bill," Peterson
said. "I think we're close, but I'm not in charge of
anything."]{.mark}]{.underline}

**Congress can't focus on multiple issues, and new, unexpected
legislation sets-off partisan fights that de-rail legislation**

**Madonna et al 12**

Anthony, Assistant Professor University of Georgia, et al Richard L.

and Collateral Damage: Assessing the Impact of Supreme Court Nominations
on Presidential Success in the U.S. Senate," pg online @
http://spia.uga.edu/faculty_pages/ajmadonn/Presidential%20Capital.pdf

It is "often overlooked" that presidents "operate in a world they do not
control" (Beckmann 2010, 13). Supreme Court vacancies yield important
(and often unexpected) additions to the president's "to do" list.
Despite the president's power to influence the legislative agenda and
achieve confirmation for his judicial nominees, [[unanticipated]{.mark}
exogenous [shocks]{.mark} can [distract from]{.mark}]{.underline} these
[[priorities]{.underline}.]{.mark} [**These** events]{.underline}
**[[divert lawmakers' efforts to new concerns at the expense of]{.mark}
preexisting [agenda items]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Exogenous shocks
[cost]{.mark}]{.underline} president's [**[time, resources, and
attention]{.mark}** previously devoted to other endeavors]{.underline}.
We theorize that Supreme Court vacancies and the nominations that follow
function as exogenous shocks to the presidential agenda and influence
success in both the legislative arena and the lower court confirmation
process.8 [Political scientists have established that exogenous events
influence]{.underline} presidential [success]{.underline}, but their
interest has been devoted primarily to major domestic or national
security crises (Beckmann 2010; Lebo and Cassino 2007). Those events
often, but not always, demand immediate and ongoing attention. Despite
the substantive differences between Supreme Court nominations and other
types of exogenous events, we argue that they share many of their
characteristics. Once a Supreme Court justice leaves office or declares
her intention to do so, the president is responsible for selecting her
successor. The vetting and confirmation processes require presidents'
attention and time, both of which are scarce goods for political elites
(Jones and Baumgartner 2005; Oppenheimer 1985). The amount of time and
political capital spent on a Supreme Court nominee is largely dependent
on the ideology of the president and key legislators (Johnson and
Roberts 2004, 2005). Presidents want to select nominees in line with
their own ideological preferences, but must take into account the
preferences of key senators (Moraski and Shipan 1999). The statement by
Senator Reid suggests that Supreme Court nominations can distract
legislators despite rational selection behavior by presidents. As a
result, Supreme Court nominees can occupy time that would be allocated
to different priorities. **[[Time is a valuable commodity in the
Senate]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Its value has increased as the number of
bills introduced has grown, obstruction has become commonplace, and
party polarization has increased]{.underline}. In other words,
[[senatorial time]{.mark} has been [filled by]{.mark} two major sources:
[the]{.mark} sheer [volume of bills]{.mark}]{.underline} (many of which
are trivial but must be considered) **[[and more extensive time spent
debating the bills that are controversial]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[Eventually, [these]{.mark} increased [demands on the time]{.mark} of
Congress [have policy consequences]{.mark} because [sessions expire
before i]{.mark}mportant [legislation can be considered]{.mark} and
passed]{.underline} (Oppenheimer 1985). [Majority party leadership in
the Senate lacks the ability to issue restrictive floor rules and small
groups or individuals from either party can obstruct the legislative
process]{.underline}. Despite the presence of a cloture rule allowing
three-fifths of the chamber to end debate, [incidents of obstruction
have increased fairly dramatically]{.underline} in the latter half of
the twentieth century (Binder 1997; Koger 2010; Wawro and Schickler
2004, 2006). [Even when the Senate majority can muster a supermajority
for cloture, the process is still fairly time consuming]{.underline}.
The vote on a cloture petition can occur only after it lies over for two
calendar days. Then, an additional 30 hours of debate and amending
activity can occur before a final vote is taken on the measure. Given
the large number of judicial nominations, moving cloture on all or many
of them is untenable. As Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) noted
in 2010, "there isn't enough time in the world -- the Senate world, at
least -- to move cloture on every one of these \[judicial nominations\]"
(Wilson and Murray 2010).

Congress reconvenes for a lame-duck session next week and [[funding
for]{.mark} President Trump's border [wall with Mexico will be front and
center]{.mark} as lawmakers turn to unsettled budget items for the
current fiscal year]{.underline}. After turning up the volume on
immigration issues in the run-up to the midterm vote, [Trump signaled
this week that he still wants funding for a wall]{.underline}. "We need
the money to build the wall, the whole wall, not pieces of it," Trump
said at a combative press conference Wednesday. [[Democrats aren't
likely to grant Trump's wish but the parties will need to find a way to
address the issue]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Money for the border wall could
become a key sticking point as lawmakers face a deadline for seven
appropriations bills that cover funding for about 25 percent of the
federal government]{.underline}, including the Department of Homeland
Security. The continuing resolution currently providing funding expires
on December 7. How many billions? House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy
(R-CA) introduced a bill last month that would provide about \$23
billion for a wall, close to Trump's demand for \$25 billion, but few
saw it as a viable proposal. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell
(R-KY) is reportedly eying an appropriation of as much as \$5 billion,
in line with what the House has put forth and more than the \$1.6
billion the Senate approved in its version of the Homeland Security
spending bill earlier this year. But [[any new bill will require the
cooperation of]{.mark} Senate [Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s, who have sent mixed
messages]{.mark} about how they plan to handle the
negotiations]{.underline}. Earlier this week, Senate Minority Leader
Chuck [Schumer]{.underline} (D-NY) said [he had little interest in
negotiating with Trump over immigration]{.underline}. "The president's a
very poor negotiator on those issues. He sort of backs off so we're sort
of dubious of the president,\" Schumer said Wednesday. But Schumer also
said that negotiations among lawmakers were making progress and that
"there are good agreements on border security and other things that are
in the Homeland Security appropriation." Complicating factors:
Immigration activists are pressuring resurgent Democrats to reject wall
funding entirely. "No more walls, agents, or detention centers are
needed," Vicki Gaubeca of the Southern Border Communities Coalition told
reporters Thursday. And Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), the leading candidate to be
the next House speaker, said just before the election, "Why would we
compromise on the wall now?" The status of the Deferred Action for
Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program further complicates the picture,
providing an opportunity for both compromise and conflict. Earlier
efforts to negotiate a wall-for-DACA deal quickly fell apart, and with
[Democrats preparing to take over the House in January, it seems less
likely that they'll be interested in a making a deal]{.underline}. The
bottom line: **[[It all adds up to what could be a fierce budget
battle]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- budget expert Stan Collender said
**[[we should prepare for "lame duck madness"]{.mark}]{.underline}** ---
with the possibility of a partial government shutdown looming in the
background. Asked about the possibility of a shutdown over wall funding,
Trump said earlier this week, "I can't commit to that, but it's
possible."

In remarks to reporters Wednesday, [Peterson]{.underline} said he
[remains skeptical about Trump]{.underline}\'s trade war, which has
resulted in retaliatory tariffs against U.S. farmers. Assuming he gets
the chairmanship of the House Committee on Agriculture, [Peterson will
have sway over large federal programs]{.underline} involving the farm
sector as well as hold hearings and help shape policies involving
agricultural trade, nutrition programs such as food stamps, rural
development and conservation, as well as the large farm bill. \"The
president is doing his thing,\" said Peterson. \"I [don\'t agree with
what he\'s doing as it relates to agriculture]{.underline}.\" That said,
Peterson agrees that there are some \"problems with China\" as it
relates to fair trade. \"But I think we\'re being held hostage by
something I\'m not sure is going to be resolved in our favor in the end
anyway. I don\'t see any scenario where agriculture is going to be
better off than we were before all this started with China.\" In the
case of China, American soybeans have been a major target of Beijing\'s
tariffs. About 60 percent of the soybeans grown in Minnesota are
exported, and about half of them in recent years have gone to customers
in China. Minnesota\'s agriculture industry also relies heavily on
exports to Canada and Mexico. Together, the two U.S. allies account for
nearly half of Minnesota\'s agricultural exports, according to Kevin
Paap, president of the Minnesota Farm Bureau Federation. Despite the new
trade deal announced with Canada and Mexico, known as the United
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the two allies continue to have
retaliatory tariffs on products in response to Trump\'s duties on
imported aluminum and steel. Peterson said Wednesday he planned to
support the replacement deal for the North American Free Trade
Agreement. \"Ag exports are really important economic drivers,\" said
Paap. \"Our biggest concern in agriculture is that once you lose the
market, it\'s really hard to get it back. And we don\'t want to lose
those markets, those relationships.\" The Trump administration has
offered about \$6 billion in initial relief to U.S. farmers affected by
retaliatory tariffs to help them weather the trade war. \"The farm
bureau certainly prefers trade over aid,\" said Paap, who grows soybeans
and corn in southern Minnesota. Paap also said it was welcome news for
Minnesota\'s agribusiness that Peterson would chair the agriculture
panel in the House. \"That is extremely important and very valuable,\"
the farm official said. \"We saw Mr. Peterson as chairman of the House
Agriculture Committee prior, so he\'s not an unknown commodity.\" Paap
continued, \"We\'ve seen over the years, whether you\'re chairman or
ranking member, a lot of agriculture things coming out of the ag
committee are written in a bipartisan manner.\" At the same time,
**[[Peterson]{.underline}]{.mark}** also [[is]{.mark} one]{.underline}

[[conference committee]{.mark} tasked with negotiating differences over

**[[didn\'t]{.mark} [include]{.mark} stricter [working

Times:
https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/government-funding-border-wall-await-lame-duck-congress/articleshow/66601683.cms)

For their last act, Republicans will try to deliver on Trump\'s promise
to fund the border wall, which could spark a partial federal government
shutdown in weeks. Newly emboldened Democrats are in no mood to
cooperate over wall money. Instead, they\'ll be pushing to protect
special counsel Robert Mueller\'s probe from acting Attorney General
Matt Whitaker, who has criticized the investigation into Russian
interference in the 2016 election. All sides must agree to a federal
funding bill to prevent a partial government shutdown from beginning on
Dec. 7. \"House Democrats are anything but lame ducks,\" Democratic
leader Nancy Pelosi wrote Monday to colleagues, saying Democrats are
\"flying high and taking pride\" in the greatest Democratic sweep of the
House since the Watergate election of 1974. They picked up at least 32
seats, with several races still undecided. \"We have great opportunity,
and therefore great responsibility to get results for the American
people,\" [Pelosi]{.underline} [wrote]{.underline}. Democrats \"need to
be unified, find common ground with Republicans in our legislative
engagements, but [stand our ground]{.underline} when we must.\" Against
this backdrop, dozens of new House lawmakers and a handful of new
senators arrived for a whirlwind orientation session. They will take
their official photos, meet colleagues and take what could prove to be
the toughest vote of their early careers --- electing their leadership.
Several new Congressional Progressive Caucus members held their first
news conference Monday. \"I hope that we are ushering in a new era,\"
said Rep.-elect Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass. Their majority lost, House
Republicans will start the task of rebuilding. Retiring Speaker Paul
Ryan will begin to transition out of power and next-in-line Kevin
McCarthy of California is favored over conservative Rep. Jim Jordan of
Ohio, a leader of the Freedom Caucus, to win the job of incoming
minority leader in leadership elections Wednesday. GOP Whip Steve
Scalise of Louisiana is expected keep his spot unchallenged. And new to
leadership will be Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the daughter of former
Vice President Dick Cheney, in the No. 3 position of conference chair.
\"We\'ve got to change the way that we operate and really in some ways
be more aggressive,\" Cheney, running unopposed, told The Associated
Press. Senators will also select their leaders, but few surprises are
expected. On the Democratic side, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York is set
to return as leader, even though the party lost several seats in the
election. Schumer suggested Democrats would use the lame-duck session to
fight to protect special counsel. \"People are really concerned about
this,\" Schumer told CNN. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has
predicted a \"lively\" lame-duck session. The Kentucky Republican has
said legislation to protect Mueller is \"unnecessary\" because the
investigation is \"not under threat.\" McConnell is poised to again lead
Republicans, but term limits are pushing GOP Whip John Cornyn of Texas
out of the No. 2 spot, making way for South Dakota Sen. John Thune to
move up. Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso and Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri will
round out the team, and Cornyn will still have a seat at McConnell\'s
table of counselors. McConnell is also trying to add a female senator to
a lower leadership spot, seeking to address the optics of having an
all-male leadership slate in a year that brought a record number of
women to Congress. The biggest leadership race is Pelosi\'s bid to
return as the first female House speaker, a contest she says she\'s
\"100 percent\" confident she will win despite a public campaign by some
incumbent and newly elected Democrats to oust her. Preliminary voting
won\'t unfold for House Democrats until after Thanksgiving. Amid the
leadership shuffle, [[lawmakers have **several pieces of legislation**
they want to finish]{.underline}]{.mark} by year\'s end, [including [a
**farm**]{.mark} policy **[bill]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and
**[legislation]{.mark} [overhauling]{.mark}** Congress\' [handling of
**sexual harassment**]{.mark} claims]{.underline}. The Senate will [try
to [confirm]{.mark} more of **[Trump\'s]{.mark}** judicial and
administrative **[nominees]{.mark}**]{.underline}, including [[a
vote]{.underline}]{.mark} this week [[on]{.mark} Michelle [Bowman
to]{.mark}]{.underline} be a member of [[the
Fed]{.underline}]{.mark}eral Reserve\'s board of governors. But first
[[they]{.underline}]{.mark} [appear]{.underline}ed [[headed toward a
**showdown over Trump\'s wall**]{.underline}]{.mark} along the
U.S.-Mexico border. Trump spent weeks ahead of the midterm election
rallying fears over a migrant caravan heading toward the border and
promised voters that Republicans would bring tougher border security.
House Republicans have already approved \$5 billion for Trump\'s wall,
but in the Senate, where Republicans need Democratic support to prevent
a filibuster, a bipartisan bill allocates \$1.6 billion. McCarthy upped
the stakes by introducing legislation for the full \$25 billion the
White House wants in border funds as he tries to shore up support from
conservatives ahead of the GOP leadership election. It\'s unclear how
hard Republicans will be willing to fight for the wall, given that
dozens of House GOP lawmakers are serving their final days in Congress
after retiring or losing their re-election races. Ryan had promised a
\"big fight\" over the border money and McConnell said a mini-shutdown
may be necessary to help Trump \"get what he\'s looking for\" on the
wall. Rep. Nita Lowey of New York, who is set to chair the House
Appropriations Committee, said Democrats \"have our boxing gloves on\"
to spar with Trump and other Republicans. The top Democrat on the Senate
Appropriations panel, Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, on Monday told
reporters Trump is the only person in Washington who seems to want to a
shutdown. Firefighters battling California wildfires, police officers
and other emergency responders all would be hurt by a shutdown, he said.
[[If]{.mark} Republicans insist that \"[it\'s the wall or
nothing]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [then]{.underline}
[they]{.underline}]{.mark} are going to [[get
nothing]{.underline}]{.mark},\" Leahy said.

#### The countries that [matter]{.underline} for their impact are [resilient]{.underline} and [institutional responses]{.underline} prevent escalation

However, **[[current research does not]{.underline}]{.mark}** yet
**[[indicate a]{.mark} clear [link between]{.mark}]{.underline}**
climate change, **[[food insecurity and conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
except perhaps where rapidly deteriorating water availability cuts
across existing tensions and weak institutions. But a series of
interlinked problems -- changing global patterns of consumption of
energy and scarce resources, increasing demands for food imports (which
draw on land, water, and energy inputs) can create pressure on fragile
situations. **[Food security -- and food prices -- are a highly
political issue]{.underline}**, being a very immediate and visible
source of popular welfare or popular uncertainty. **[But their link to
conflict]{.underline}** (and the wider links between climate change and
conflict) **[is indirect]{.underline}** rather than direct. What makes
some countries more resilient than others? **[[Many countries]{.mark}
face [food price]{.mark} or natural resource [shocks without]{.mark}
falling into [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Essentially, the two
important **[factors]{.underline}** in **[determining their resilience
are]{.underline}**: First, **[whether food insecurity is combined with
other stresses]{.underline}** -- issues such as unemployment, but most
fundamentally issues such as political exclusion or human rights abuses.
**[We sometimes read]{.underline}** nowadays that the 2006-2009
**[drought was a factor in the Syrian conflict,]{.underline}** by
driving rural-urban migration that caused societal stresses. It may of
course have been one factor amongst many but **[it would be too
simplistic to suggest]{.underline}** that **[it was the primary
driver]{.underline}** of the Syrian conflict. Second, **[whether
countries have strong enough [institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}** to
fulfill a social compact with their citizens, **[[provid]{.mark}ing
[help]{.mark} quickly [to citizens]{.mark} affected by food
insecurity]{.underline}**, with or without international assistance.
**[[During the]{.underline}]{.mark}** 2007-20**[[08]{.mark} food
[crisis, developing countries]{.mark} with low institutional strength
[experienced more]{.mark} food price [protests]{.mark}]{.underline}**
than those with higher institutional strengths, and more than half these
protests turned violent. **[This]{.underline}** for example, **[is the
difference in the events [in]{.mark} Haiti versus]{.underline}** those
in **[[Mexico or the Philippines]{.mark} where far greater
[institutional strength existed]{.mark} to deal with the food price
shocks and protests did not spur deteriorating national
[security]{.mark} or widespread violence]{.underline}**.
