Indeed, **[[in exactly the same way as other consumer products, women of
different skin colours, ethnicities, ages, sizes, body shapes,
personalities and 'styles of performance' are displayed in
catalogues]{.mark}, also [on Internet pages, in the time-space
compressed world]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} [Whether
[consumers]{.mark} are seeking virtual pleasure or real-life excitement,
they [are offered a choice]{.mark} -- of 'Noble Savages' and 'Sable
Queens' of Africa, 'Tahitian Beauties' or 'Oriental Temptresses' --
[comparable to the wide range of foods and drinks available on an
international buffet table]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a matter of fact, as
Kemadoo (1996: 76) aptly concludes[, the ['sex industries today depend
upon the eroticization of the ethnic and cultural "other"'. Fuelled by
the explosion of global exchange of people, products and images,
consumers seeking sexual pleasure can opt to 'go ethnic' to satisfy
their globalized fantasies.]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[Just as we would

wild in the borderless capitalist sex market]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The
World Sex Archives page claims that its members are 'seasoned travelers
who have been around the world experiencing the finest pussy on the
planet" (http://www.worldsexarchives.com/ demo/, retrieved 28 November

diversity is now commonplace also in physical form, especially in
cosmopolitan cities worldwide. [[On his sex tour of Hong Kong, JustJoe
came into contact with 'poor Chinese women', 'Filipino maids', 'Thai
girls', 'China girl' and 'Hong Kong girl']{.underline}]{.mark}. He
shares his 'scientifically-proven' philosophy about having sexual
contact with women of different cultural backgrounds with the Web
readers (http://hongkong.worldsexarchives.com/, retrieved 28 November

find women of other cultures (especially Asian) so delicious to fuck and
compelling and addictive? Well, there might be a clue in something
called [[a genetic diversification strategy]{.mark}\.... Maybe we're
driven by (it) to foreign countries to fuck their women, not only
because it's fun, but also because [we're fulfilling some drive that
much deeper]{.mark}. So maybe [we're not driven by only what's in our
jeans, but what's in our genes]{.mark}.']{.underline} (JustJoe, 2007) In
addition to cultural diversity, women of differing body features,
personalities and levels of sophistication are made available. [[In

women are increasingly perceived as commodities, like world music or
ethnic cuisines, to be ordered and consumed anywhere and anytime.
Marketing strategies anchor on sexist and racist stereotypes.
'Non-Western' women are often considered to be more satisfying compared
to their 'Western' counterparts (http://www.worldsexarchives.com/demo/,

will walk down the street and have her replaced in less than 15
minutes]{.mark}. Accordingly, when you tell your non-Western girlfriend
to start sucking she knows she better do a real good job!]{.underline}
This website is about finding those types of women.' Women of diverse

While varying in technical details, this plethora of technological
developments has engendered a new spatiality in the operation of the sex
industries. [[**Sexual predators and pimps consume and deal, exploit and
harm women and children quickly and anonymously, and even in the privacy
of their homes and at work**, rather than requiring them to expose
themselves in pornographic stores or theatres, while images and
descriptions of the service providers are being displayed and
discussed]{.mark} more and [more publicly.]{.mark}]{.underline} Virtual
sex might give an impression that the women would be better protected
from abuse due to the physical distance between users and service
providers. In fact, [researchers have revealed that [abuse in the cyber
sex space is common]{.mark}. In an e-mail a sex worker writes, '\...
it's pretty bad working at \[an\] adult \[web\]site\... the abuse is way
beyond what goes on at strip clubs\...]{.underline}' (Hughes 2003: 115).
[[While]{.mark} [technically a sex worker can click away]{.mark} their
clients [when interactions are abusive]{.mark} and unpleasant, [it is
seldom performed because of the need to earn and the control of
supervisors]{.mark}]{.underline} (Do¨ring 2000). The Internet also
enables abuse to take place without the victims' knowing[. [Some women
may not realize that their photographs and videos]{.mark} (sometimes
taken without the women's knowledge or consent) [are posted and sold on
pornographic websites. Descriptions and discussions about their
appearance, bodies and 'performance' in the world wide forum]{.mark},
which by the way is [dominated by male users]{.mark}**, [intensify
humiliation and trauma involved in the sex business]{.mark}**[, which
has always been marked by immense power difference between consumers and
service providers]{.mark}]{.underline}. These hundreds of publicly
accessible chatrooms and websites provide a space for pornographic
consumers to normalize and legitimize their abusive hobby, and reinforce
their attitudes with their peers, creating a support community. Hughes
(2003) expresses her worry that the accessibility of such material would
lead men and boys to search for increasingly violent and extreme
pornography, and travel to places where they can exploit and abuse women
and children without likelihood of arrest. In a similar vein, the United
Nations Children's Fund has also underlined their concern that, 'Digital
technology, with its obvious attractions for children, often facilitates
recruitment of kids into these practices. It can also be seen as a safer
form of prostitution' (The Manila Times 2005).

Giving voice to the individual experience has added new dimensions of
understanding to feminist theories by recognising the agency, autonomy
and resilience of individual women. [Abusing the vulnerability of women
should be confined to situations where there is \'no real and acceptable
alternative but to submit to the abuse involved\']{.underline} (Travaux
pr6paratoires, 2000). Do adult migrant sex workers who consent to engage
in this work really want to be treated as trafficked and be
rehabilitated? **[[The \'rescue and rehabilitation\' strategy promotes a
gender essentialism that fails to take into account multiple and
contradictory subject positions. Such strategies do not empower women
but actually add to controlling women and policing their

be to acknowledge consent, protect women\'s labour rights in the sex
industry and reduce exploitative practices in the work environment. In
the end, the UN trafficking protocol adopted a coercion-based definition
of trafficking. [Even \'[abuse of vulnerability\' should be interpreted
as a psychological and non- physical form of coercion or

**Immanentforms 15** (blog on American racial phenomena, "Whiteness is a
Weapon", Immanentforms: Thinking About it, August 21, 2015,
https://immanentforms.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/whiteness-is-a-weapon/)

I had an interesting conversation with TJ last night about a very
challenging post on his site titled, bluntly, "[There are no 'good white
people]{.underline}.'" TJ is wrestling here with how [[the]{.mark}
American (and European) [concept of "whiteness" and the national
environment of white-supremacy distorts all of u]{.mark}s]{.underline}
(white people and PoC) [[as individuals and pollutes the relationships
we have with one another]{.underline}]{.mark}. He concisely brings out
the real, devastating and (for the foreseeable future) inescapable
consequences of the fiction of race--the social reality of the invented
category--and he points out the privileged asymmetry through which
people marked as white can pretend to escape white-supremacy (this is
the other side of the burden of knowledge that Baldwin and Coates
elegantly describe). I encourage you to read TJ's post in its entirety,
but I will quote the opening here: Sometimes I wonder if white people
know what a constant state of grace and forbearance they get from people
of color every day. I think so many white folk like to imagine that
they're the "good ones," that they don't do fucked up or racist things,
and that they're not bad and wouldn't seek to marginalize or hurt POC
ever. But honestly, we live in a society where things are tilted for you
every damn day. At any point, any of you can turn on us. Lovers,
friends, family, colleagues. Any of you. [As TJ and I discussed
yesterday, this is,]{.underline} in some ways, [a statement of our
general human condition]{.underline}: goodness isn't a location you can
arrive at or an object you can come to possess. Goodness is an active
principle, and you are only ever as good as your present actions. Hannah
Arendt describes human qualities like goodness, courage, etc. as
"virtues" in Machiavelli's sense of virtue: goodness (etc.) is an action
performed among other human beings, and you are only good when you are
giving a virtuosic performance. Jay Smooth puts it more simply: being
good (being anti-racist, for instance) is like brushing your teeth; you
have to do it every day. Going back to TJ's terminology, [there are no
good white people because you have to perform your role as an ally every
day. You never arrive at the point where you don't have to think about
it or where you can be a little bit racist because you earned your "good
white person" badge]{.underline}. The reality of that continuous
responsibility comes through with painful clarity in TJ's point that
"[At any point, any of you can turn]{.underline} on us." If you think
being constantly on your toes as a white ally sounds demanding,
[[imagine being a person of color who can be betrayed by allies and
intimates at any moment]{.mark}.]{.underline} If white allies live under
a constant moral imperative, people of color live under a constant
threat of injury that could arrive without warning from any direction.
**[[White supremacy is racial terrorism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, even in
its most genteel forms; [it shapes lives through the threat of violence,
even when things appear calm.]{.underline} [As white allies, we have to
recognize that **[whiteness is a weapon]{.mark}.** [We are born with
this weapon, we cannot put it down, and we injure people with
it]{.mark}]{.underline} when we forget it is in our hands. [The national
(and international) structures of white supremacy gave us these weapons
to use for our own benefit]{.underline}. [It designed the weapon of
whiteness to]{.underline} hobble people of color and [give us an
advantage over them in life[.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**It designed its
weapon to** exploit, control and **destroy black bodies for the benefit
of white people**]{.underline}]{.mark}. We can renounce those designs
and live our lives against the grain of white supremacy, but--and this
is a tragedy for everyone involved--[[as long as we live within an
environment structured by white supremacy, we cannot put the weapon
down]{.mark}.]{.underline} We cannot put it down because we are the
weapon: [the structure of white supremacy engraves whiteness into our
bodies, and we cannot escape our bodies.]{.underline} [We live within/as
the weapon of whiteness.]{.underline} We do not have to use our
whiteness to attack others, but, even when we do not use it to
intentionally, whiteness threatens to wound those around us the moment
we get careless. Worse than that, [[the weapon of whiteness is a threat
even when we are mindful and careful and
conscientious]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is a threat because, as TJ points
out, any one of us can turn on our friends, family, lovers, etc. at any
moment, even if we don't mean to do it. [No degree of enlightenment or
number of good deeds will sheath the blade of our whiteness or make it
incapable of injuring others.]{.underline} Because we carry and will
always carry this destructive weapon with us, we must dedicate ourselves
to mindfulness, to care, and to gratitude for the grace and forbearance
we receive from the PoC who stay with us knowing that we will hurt them.
(As TJ and I discussed last night, a similar structure also applies to
relationships between men and women in partriarchal environments, to
cis-gendered people in transphobic environments, etc.)

To focus on the femme fatale, of course, also means introducing the
question of gender difference into a discussion of tragic sensibility,
in the sense that, while she comes to acknowledge her responsibility for
her fate, the hero she involves in her transgressive plot is
characterized by the exact opposite attitude, namely, a desire to stave
off knowledge of his own fallibility at all costs. In the classic noir
plot, the hero quite coincidentally meets the alluring femme fatale?in
Double Indemnity he happens to pass by her villa and enters to ask her
husband to renew a car insurance policy. \\et their meeting follows the
fateful logic of a love at first sight. As Mladen Dolar notes, what
seemingly happened uninten tionally and by pure chance is belatedly
recognized as the realization of an innermost wish: \"the pure chance
was actually no chance at all: the intrusion of the unforeseen turned
into necessity. [[the hero catches sight of the femme fatale, both find
themselves caught in a sequence of events which can go only one
way.]{.mark} Both are tragically framed within a narrative of fate and
can only come to accept the law of causation.]{.underline} [Yet if the
contingent turn from free choice to inevitability is aligned with a
masculine gaze appropriating a seductive feminine body, [one must not
overlook the fact that as bearer of the hero\'s look**, it is the femme
fatale-who manipulates the outcome of their fatal meeting**]{.mark}. It
may be a coincidence that this particular man has caught her in his
field of vision, but [she has been expecting someone like him]{.mark} to
do precisely that. [**She knows all along that she is fated and can,
therefore, turn what is inevitable into a source of power.**]{.mark}
Indeed, the classic femme fatale has enjoyed such popularity because she
is not only sexually uninhibited, but also unabashedly independent and
ruthlessly ambitious, using her seductive charms and her intelligence to
liberate herself from the imprisonment of an unfulfilling
marriage.]{.underline} Furthermore, though she gains power over the noir
hero by nourishing his sexual fantasies, her own interest is only
superficially erotic[. [She entertains a narcissistic pleasure at the
deployment of her own ability to dupe the men who fall for her, even as
she is merciless in manipulating them for her own ends]{.underline}.
**[Duplicity thus emerges as her most seminal value, insofar as she is
not simply willing to delude anyone in order to get the money and the
freedom she is after, but because she will never show her true
intentions to anyone,]{.underline}**]{.mark} especially not the hero she
has inveigled, even if this entails not only his death but also her own.

"[[It is impossible to be unarmed when]{.underline} **[my blackness is
the weapon you fear]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[."]{.underline}** Reverend
Traci Blackmon Over the past few decades, and since the inception of
what this country calls freedom, it has been considered best -and often
lawful - practice to protect ourselves from each other, to apply dignity
to a few and a label on some spectrum of "landscape to dangerous" to
others. \"This may seem a contradiction, but ... it is neither a crime
nor an absurdity. When we profess, as our fundamental principle, that
liberty is the inalienable right of every man, we do not include madmen
or idiots; liberty in their hands would become a scourge. [Till the mind
of the slave has been educated to perceive what are the obligations of a
state of freedom, the gift would insure its abuse."]{.underline} "Keep
poor whites as separate, and as distinct as possible from the Negroes,
who want no encouragement to mix with, and become too familiar (for no
good purpose) with these kinds of people." George Washington Whether
inherited by desire or design, this is the legacy that influences
culture and governance in the United States. [[People of color are
presumed to be **armed** with rage, insensitivity, unruliness and
general bad behavior]{.underline}]{.mark}. The architects of this nation
sought to shield themselves from us, and divide us from each other.
**[[Fear]{.underline}]{.mark}** (of true freedom, equality for all)
[[**is the weapon of choice for white centeredness.** Racism wields the
weapon too, though often disguised]{.underline}]{.mark}. Born of a fear
that people of color are super-human, [[**white supremacy armed itself
with legalized displacement**,]{.mark} slavery and terrorism in order to
mark us as sub-human]{.underline}, [and it now relieves itself of the
guilt of killing us, since we are anti-innocent non-humans by
law.]{.underline} Justice will not come about by simply acknowledging
the existence of this weapon, we all know that it exists and is in
regular use (reference any number of human lives recently reduced to
hashtags). No, freedom must be demanded[**. [It is time for every person
]{.mark}**[of good will **to stand in the way of weaponized whiteness
and demand that it disarm itself**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} We bear
witness to whiteness that our [Blackness is only a weapon to those who
fear it.]{.underline} In the past few years in our region, [we have
watched police arm themselves, then command unarmed civilians to cease,
desist, and "stand down" in their own neighborhoods. Of what metal is
our melanin? What match is Black skin to tactical gear]{.underline}?
Like the mirrored casket from Ferguson that makes its way into the halls
of history this very weekend, [we must speak up and disrupt in order to
show the empire its own reflection. The people accused of being deadly
and dangerous are standing on the street without weapons,]{.underline}
while law enforcement claiming to "fear for their lives" are armed to
the hilt. [We must deliberately dismantle the fear-based ethnic divides
with which we have been conditioned to arm ourselves]{.underline}. We
must do this daily, boldly, and in one accord. [[The most insidious
piece of weaponized whiteness may very well be its ability to cause
people of color to forget each other in the struggle for full
liberation.]{.underline}]{.mark} Within the United States, scholars and
activists have pointed out [the perils of basing theories of racism, as
well as anti-racist practices, on the black-white paradigm that informed
the quest for civil rights]{.underline} and, further, of [assuming that
the civil rights paradigm is foundational to the very meaning of
anti-racism. Neither paradigm can account, for example, for the role
colonization and genocide against indigenous people played in shaping
U.S. racism]{.underline}. The historical genocide against indigenous
people relies precisely on invisibility---on an obstinate refusal to
recognize the very existence of native North Americans, or a recognition
or misrecognition that only acknowledges them as impediments to the
transformation of the landscape---impediments to be destroyed or
assimilated. - Angela Davis The most effectual movements for change
focus on truth-telling. People of faith are taught to remember this by
our own calling to speak truth in love. In this movement, [[speaking the
truth in love is love]{.mark}. [And love is how we stay
woke.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[The humanity of my Native neighbor should
disarm me of any false assumptions about them]{.mark}. The humanity of
Black people should be celebrated, embraced and empathized with, not
diminished]{.underline}. Any attempt to de-humanize a person is the
manifestation of our deep fear of the truth - that we are all equals.
[Feeding]{.underline} this [fear is the primary goal of all supremacist
notions.]{.underline} Whiteness in the United States has armed itself
out of fear that it is in fact just as human, vulnerable and valuable as
any other race. [Weaponized with fear, and self-centered as the source
of all cultural and political "authority" - it must maintain power in
order to insure its own way of life. In so doing, it puts all other
lives at risk.]{.underline}

#### Affirming a politics of gradience allows for a better understanding of consent, for us to practice consent, both in debate where abusive/coercive relationships are highly prevalent (both in interpersonal relationships and also as consenting to certain practices) and also in our lives writ large. Knowing how there are disparities in consent and what bodies have less ability to consent than others makes it easier to understand what a world of full consent may look like, or to empower otherized bodies to have more consent. Resistance is born of critique. We talk about the extrapolation of consent specifically against non-white women- black femme fatale forces gradience b/c she is always in control of herself- aff resolves the trick of whiteness that consent is a binary

#### A reclamation of the seductress must begin from the black femme fatale, that which reduces hegemonic masculinity and power to masochistic playthings through the degeneration of Western value schemas

Besides dominating the males through her sexual power, [[Xica causes
anxiety for the colonial elite by getting involved with men who are
against colonial rule]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as her owner's son José
(Stepan Nercessian) and Teodoro (Marcus Vinícius). José is involved with
the anticolonial movement known as Inconfidência Mineira, 5 while
Teodoro explores the diamond mines without permission from the ruling
authorities and refuses to pay the high taxes he owes the Portuguese
Crown. However, [[despite the black femme fatale representing numerous
threats, the white European "hero,"]{.underline}]{.mark} João Fernandes,
[[cannot avoid getting involved with her, and he provides her with
whatever she demands]{.underline}]{.mark}. João Fernandes's relationship
with Xica paradoxically becomes necessary for him as it reaffirms his

sufficiently cleansed and strengthened]{.mark} from his encounter with
the revalorised colonial subject [to be able to assert his own]{.mark}
status as hero faced with the more pernicious exoticism of the femme
fatale"]{.underline} (478). In Xica da Silva, João [Fernandes gets
involved with a femme fatale who possesses an unrestrained sexual drive
that is a test for his status as a hero]{.underline} and a patriarchal
male. However, [[he fails the test and his involvement with the
"devalued]{.underline}]{.mark}," exotic, and colonized [[black femme
fatale costs him his position of power]{.mark} as he loses his post as a
contractor because of this]{.underline}. Hence, unlike what Yee states
about European heroes in her study, João Fernandes does not leave the
colony as a strengthened hero. The sense of "otherness" in Xica da Silva
additionally recalls the perception of other colonized countries that
different European colonizers' discourses have portrayed over centuries.
[T[he image of inhabitants of such countries has been propagated as
essentially sexual]{.mark}]{.underline}, which provides possibilities
for the colonizer to not only fulfill his prohibited sexual desires but
also reassure his masculinity. McClintock argues that during the
Renaissance European travelers had "an eager and lascivious audience for
their spicy tales" (22). The author further contends that [[Africa and
the Americas became the "porno-tropics for the European
imagination]{.underline}]{.mark}" and "a fantastic magic lantern of the
mind onto which Europe projected its forbidden sexual desires and fears"
(22). However, their sexual contact with nonwhite women in the colonial
setting brought risks because "[t[hrough sexual contact]{.mark} with
women of colour [European men 'contracted' not only disease but debased
sentiments, immoral proclivities and extreme susceptibility to
decivilised states]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Stoler, qtd. in McClintock
48). [This projection of prohibited desires McClintock points out is
presented in Xica da Silva through the construction of the black femme
fatale as the sexually insatiable "other" with whom the European male
colonizer releases his sexual desires]{.underline}. [She reduces him to
her passive and masochistic sexual plaything]{.underline}. Xica's sexual
behavior mirrors Doane's claim that **[[unrestrained female sexuality
presents a danger to the male and to the system of signification
itself]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [An example of this is how
Xica]{.underline}, similar to other neo-noir femmes fatales, [makes her
male counterparts]{.underline}, including João Fernandes, [violate
society's customs and laws by tempting them to have sex with her in
public spaces]{.underline}. Xica has sex with her counterparts in
different public places--- for example, with João Fernandes on the
veranda of their house, with José in the tower of the Convent of the
Blacks, and with the Portuguese count in her palace---being watched by
other people in most cases. [[Her sexual behavior is a stark contrast to
that of the "good" white woman who represents patriarchy's female role
model and opposes the "shameless" black femme
fatale]{.underline}]{.mark}.6 Hence, [Xica's hypersexuality is "a
racialised sexuality linked in this perversity to other women of
colour]{.underline} in representations such as the African American
mammy/Jezebel, the Native American squaw/ princess, and the
Chicana/Latina virgin/whore" (Shimizu 65). Additionally, [the black
femme fatale is constructed as the colonized sexual degenerate and the
"cannibalistic other"---]{.underline}the latter implied by the fact that
she bites people. For example, during a banquet João Fernandes and she
host for some members of the colonial elite, Xica bites the fingers of
the superintendent (played by Altair Lima) when she asks him if he was
still interested in her "teeth" as he had previously said. The scene is
significantly phallic and can be associated with the shouts the audience
hears from her counterparts during sexual intercourse with her. At
certain moments, they are heard howling "Not that, Xica!" about an act
they fear yet are unable to resist[. [**Xica subordinates men and
exercises her sexual control over them, and this threatens their
hegemonic masculinity and power as colonial males. Moreover, from a
psychoanalytic point of view,** the males' screams reveal much: **the
female genitalia,** the vagina dentata, **can "castrate" men, so the
black femme fatale represents a threat to patriarchal colonial power
because of her dangerous
sexuality**]{.underline}]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}**

#### The cannibalistic performance of the black femme fatale consumes the white colonial order, subverting the elite's demands through the exploitation of the normative values

**Da Silva 14** (Antônio Márcio da Silva, University of Surrey,
Guildford with expertise in Visual Arts, Performing Arts, World
Literatures and a pHD in Hispanic Studies, "The "Femme" Fatale in
Brazilian Cinema: Challenging Hollywood Norms", pp. 40-42)///Aakash

Cannibalism [The black femme fatale's cannibalism]{.underline}16
concerns how she appropriates what belongs to the dominant class to
"usurp" the power it signifies and empower herself. [Besides this, her
cannibalism can be linked to the concept of mimicry proposed by Bhabha
to show that this [black femme fatale's acts are not just a mimicry of
the white people]{.mark}]{.underline}---a criticism the film has
received (i.e., that Xica is "a black woman with a white soul")---but
that [**[her mimicry is a cannibalistic act that she deploys for her own
benefit to acquire the position of power she desires]{.underline}**.
[Her cannibalism is suggested not only in the goods she appropriates
but]{.underline}]{.mark} also, and [[mainly, through her sexual
acts---just like many of the other femmes fatales]{.underline}]{.mark},
especially the ones in neo-noirs. Regarding sex and cannibalism, this is
even more strongly indicated by the verb "comer" (eat) in Portuguese to
refer to the male active role in copulation. Xica, for instance, "eats"
the men with whom she has sex. [She subverts the logic of comer as a
male act. Her sexual power is so strong that it causes anxieties at the
same time it makes her, and the other femmes fatales, a feared
representation of women]{.underline}. This is evident, for example, [in
the term used for the femme fatale in Mexican cinema: la devoradora
("the devouring one").]{.underline} Such a term indicates a strong
connection with cannibalism and with the question of agency. That is,
**[[the femme fatale's "cannibalism" indicates power rather than
objectification: she is feared by patriarchal
society]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Stam (Subversive) argues that
[[cannibalism represents "otherness"]{.mark} within Western traditions
and is ["the ultimate marker of difference in a coded]{.mark}
[opposition]{.mark} of]{.underline} light and dark, rational and
irrational, [civilized and savage]{.underline}" (Stam, Tropical 238).
[Because of her race, Xica's behavior is perceived by the colonial elite
as a sign of her savagery]{.underline}, shamelessness, and
irrationality. [However, [she retaliates by mocking the racist behavior
of the white elite]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The black femme
fatale]{.underline}]{.mark} challenges white people's assumptions that
only they are clever and allowed to give orders, have luxuries, and live
a lavish lifestyle. She shows that she [[is ready to subvert the racial
and social organization that dictates these boundaries, but this does
not please the ruling class]{.underline}]{.mark}. An illustration of
Xica's stark criticism of the whites occurs in the sequence in which
João Fernandes and she host a dinner for the Portuguese count. During
the dinner, she appears with her face painted in white and wearing a
blond wig (see figures 1.3 and 1.4),17 bringing to mind Frantz Fanon's
well-known book title Black Skin, White Masks. 18 During the dinner, she
repeatedly mocks the racist count, who previously addressed her only as
the preta ("black woman"). When the man decides to try some chicken, she
tells him not to do so as it was prepared with molho pardo19 ("brown
gravy"), which is clearly a criticism of his rampant racism as the word
pardo designates mixed-race people---the mixture of black and white
(i.e., mulatto). Thus, the femme fatale's behavior criticizes "white
superiority" and recalls the white elite's "ideology of whitening"
(Stam, Cross-cultural 244) that pervaded Brazil's social imaginary
during the first decades of the twentieth century. Hence, **[[the black
femme fatale performs "cannibalism" in two ways: by consuming goods and
by sexually "devouring" her counterparts.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Her
behavior recalls Joaquim Pedro de Andrade's view of cannibalism. For
Andrade, those who can, "eat" others "through their consumption of
products, or even more directly in their sexual relationships.
[Cannibalism has merely institutionalized itself, cleverly disguising
itself]{.underline}. The new heroes. . .try to devour those who devour
us" (83). Xica voraciously devours the European "hero" sexually and this
serves as a metaphor for the nation devouring its own people---that is,
the ruling class exploiting the lower classes. [The black femme fatale's
"cannibalistic" sexual behavior]{.underline}, signaled by her sexual
counterparts' screams during their intercourse (as if they were being
eaten alive), turns her into a symbol of otherness in the colonial
society's eyes. Xica's "cannibalistic" consumerism [implies a criticism
of the colonial society's behavior]{.underline}. Many goods João
Fernandes buys for her or that she purchases are entirely superfluous to
her needs. She says that she needs to organize processions and parties
to wear all the "beautiful things" she has received---clearly to exhibit
her new status to the colonial society. She consumes for the sake of it,
as the ruling class does. [This behavior of hers denotes that she has
assimilated and is exploiting the colonizer's values and those of the
white colonial elite]{.underline}. Her exaggerated consumerism, however,
turns the ruling class not only against her but also against João
Fernandes. As a representative of the European colonizer, João Fernandes
should be "civilizing" the "other," but he becomes more and more
influenced by the black femme fatale's behavior and power. He seemingly
comes close to becoming the colonized "other" himself. The way he deals
with his identity and virility contradicts what the patriarchal society
of the European colonial metropolis would normally expect from a
European male colonizer. That is, his identity and virility are "not
autonomous or secure." On the contrary, they are "constructed in
relation to that of the gendered ethnicised other" (Woodhull 120). But
both are destabilized because of his relationship with the colonized
black femme fatale. So instead of ensuring his virility and fulfilling
the white male colonizer's hegemonic roles, he succumbs to Xica's
performance as a femme fatale, which overpowers him and turns him into
an object she manipulates to achieve her goal of occupying a distinctive
position of power within the colonial society. Therefore, **[[the black
femme fatale challenges male domination in a colonial context and
subverts the behavior that white patriarchal society dictates as the
norm to a black slave woman within this
environment]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Through]{.underline} her [power as
a femme fatale, this [black slave overturns the colonial positions of
power and inserts herself into the elite territory while mocking the
same elite]{.mark} [through mimicry and the "cannibalization" of the
whites' cultural values]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Xica's control
over João Fernandes shows that "the slave (the colonized, the black, the
woman) knows the mind of the master better than the master knows the
mind of the slave" (Spence and Stam 15--16). He becomes an example of
patriarchy's "fallen-masculinity" as he fails to resist the black femme
fatale and allows her to "rule the colony" so the white colonial elite
revolts and finds a way to annihilate Xica's power and "destroy" her.
However, Xica does not allow herself to be converted and changed into
patriarchy's "good woman," even if her obstinacy results in her
downfall. She remains faithful to her sexual and gender identities, and
even after she is "destroyed" she manages to satiate her sexual
appetite. Thus, [this black femme fatale's sexuality is a very important
aspect of her identity]{.underline} and is related not only to her race
but also to her very condition as a woman, which is also the case for
other femmes fatales. Moreover, [the ways she uses her body and her
sexuality, besides challenging hegemonic sexual and gender roles, show
how important gender identity is for the femme fatale's subjectivity and
how such an identity is performatively constituted.]{.underline}

#### Universalized definitions of time & space are bought and sold in the project of slavery to unmake the black woman and reduce her merely to property. Time and Space coordinates force black women into production.

**Hartman 16** \[Sadiya Hartman, professor at Columbia University

Brooklyn and received her B.A. from Wesleyan University and Ph.D. from
Yale University.,  Saidiya Hartman (2016) The Belly of the World: A Note
on Black Women's Labors, Souls, 18:1, 166-173\] 

Reproductive labor, as the scholars Hortense Spillers, Jennifer Morgan,
Dorothy Roberts, Alyss Weinbaum, and Neferti Tadiar note, is central to
thinking about the gendered afterlife of slavery and global capitalism.
Yet attending to the status of black women's labors has confounded our
conceptual categories and thrown our critical lexicon into crisis. On
the slave ship[, [captive women were accounted for as quantities of
greater and lesser mass, and the language of units and complete cargo
eclipsed that of the subject, the person or individual. The "anomalous
intimacy of cargo," according to Stephanie Smallwood, represented a new
social formation.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Those African persons in Middle
Passage]{.underline}, writes Spillers, were "literally suspended in the
oceanic." [They were "culturally unmade." "Under these conditions one is
neither female, nor male, as both subjects are taken into account as
quantities.]{.underline}"5 For Spillers, the categories of flesh and
body are deployed to describe the mutilation, Comments from
dismemberment, and exile of captivity and enslavement. Flesh provides
the primary narrative rather than gendered subject positions. The flesh
is produced by the violence of racial slavery and yet it brings into
view a new mode of relation. On the plantation, [black women were
required to toil as hard as men, and in this way
"ungendered,"]{.underline} according to Spillers, by which she means
that "female and male adhere to no symbolic integrity." Partus sequitur
ventrem [negated kinship and denied it any "legal or social
efficacy."]{.underline} The condition of the mother marked her offspring
and was "forever entailed on her remotest posterity." [We carry the
mother's mark and it continues to define our condition and our
present]{.underline}. The role of gender and sexual differentiation in
the constitution of labor are especially complex in the context of
slavery. On one hand, the category of labor insufficiently accounts for
slavery as a mode of power, domination and production. The fungibility
of the slave[, the wanton uses of the black body for producing value or
pleasure, and the shared vulnerabilities of the commodity,]{.underline}
whether male or female, trouble dominant accounts of gender. Depending
on the angle of vision or critical lexicon[[, the harnessing of the body
as an instrument for social and physical reproduction unmakes the slave
as gendered subject or reveals the primacy of gender and sexual
differentiation in the making of the slave]{.underline}]{.mark}. Natal
alienation is one of the central attributes of the social death of the
slave and gendered and sexual violence are central to the processes that
render the black child as by-product of the relations of production.6 At
the same time, the lines of division between the market and the
household which distinguished the public and the domestic and divided
productive and reproductive labor for propertied whites does not hold
when describing the enslaved and the carceral landscape of plantation.
Reproduction is tethered to the making of human commodities and in
service of the marketplace. For the enslaved, [reproduction does not
ensure any future other than that of dispossession nor guarantee
anything other than the replication of racialized and disposable persons
or "human increase"]{.underline} (expanded property-holdings) for the
master. The future of the enslaved was a form of speculative value for
slaveholders. Even the unborn were conscripted and condemned to slavery.
"Kinship loses meaning," according to Spillers, "since at any moment it
can be invaded at any given and arbitrary moment by property relations."
Extending and revising this line of argument, Morgan notes the
importance of maternity and reproduction in the evolution of the legal
codification of slavery. "[Women's bodies became the definitional sites
of racial slavery]{.underline}." In North America, the future of
[slavery depended upon black women's reproductive capacity as it did on
the slave market.]{.underline} The reproduction of human property and
the social relations of racial slavery were predicated upon the belly.
Plainly put, subjection was anchored in black women's reproductive
capacities. [[The captive female body,]{.underline}]{.mark} according to
Spillers, [["locates precisely a moment of converging political and
social vectors that mark the flesh as a prime commodity of
exchange.]{.underline}]{.mark}"Forced to labor for the "satisfaction of
the immediate needs" of their owners and overseers, however, those needs
were defined, [[the captive female body was subjected to innumerable
uses]{.underline}]{.mark}. It could be converted into cash, speculated
and traded as commodity, worked to death, taken, tortured, seeded, and
propagated like any other crop, 168 2016 or murdered. The value produced
by and extracted from enslaved women included productive labor---their
labors as farm workers, cotton pickers, tobacco hands, and rice
cultivators---and their reproductive capacities created "future
increase" for farms and plantations and human commodities for markets,
yoking the prospect of racial slavery to their bodies. Even the unborn
figured into the reproductive calculus of the institution. The work of
sex and procreation was the chief motor for reproducing the material,
social, and symbolic relations of slavery. The value accrued through
reproductive labor was brutally apparent to the enslaved who protested
bitterly against being bred like cattle and oxen. This reproductive
labor not only guaranteed slavery as an institutional process and
secured the status of the enslaved, but it inaugurated a regime of
racialized sexuality that continues to place black bodies at risk for
sexual exploitation and abuse, gratuitous violence, incarceration,
poverty, premature death, and state-sanctioned murder. The sexuality and
reproductive capacities of enslaved women were central to understanding
the expanding legal conception of slavery and its inheritability.
Slavery conscripted the womb, deciding the fate of the unborn and
reproducing slave property by making the mark of the mother a death
sentence for her child. The negation or disfigurement of maternity,
writes Christina Sharpe, "[turns the womb into a factory reproducing
blackness as abjection and turning the birth canal into another domestic
middle passage]{.underline}."8 Partus sequitur ventrem---replicates the
fate of the slave across generations. The belly is made a factory of
production incommensurate with notions of the maternal, the conjugal or
the domestic. In short, the slave exists out of the world and outside
the house. 

#### Thus we affirm a musical & poetic intervention into temporal & spacial complexities that seek to predicate black women's lives off of geographical location & the passing of time. Black Women exist outside of time and space coordinates that forces them Music is always here - even when the song stops we continue to move with it.

York University and has taught previously at the University of
California, Riverside, Duke University, Brown University, and the

Moten and Harney want to gesture to another place, a wild place that is
not simply the left over space that limns real and regulated zones of
polite society; rather, it is a [wild place that continuously produces
its own unregulated wildness]{.underline}. Te zone we enter through
Moten and Harney is ongoing and exists in the present and, as Harney
puts it, "some kind of demand was already being enacted, fulflled in the
call itself." While describing the London Riots of 2011, Harney suggests
that the riots and insurrections do not separate out "the request, the
demand and the call" -- rather, they enact the one in the other: "I
think the call, in the way I would understand it, the call, as in the
call and response, the response is already there before the call goes
out. You're already in something." You are already in it. For Moten too,
you are always already in the thing that you call for and that calls
you. What's more, the call is always a [call to dis-order and this
disorder or wildness shows up in many places:]{.underline} in jazz, in
improvisation, in noise. Te disordered sounds that we refer to as
cacophony will always be cast as "extra-musical," as Moten puts it,
precisely because [we hear something in them that reminds us that our
desire for harmony is arbitrary and in another world, harmony would
sound incomprehensible. Listening to cacophony and noise tells us that
there is a wild beyond to the structures we inhabit and that inhabit
us.]{.underline} And when we are called to this other place, the wild
beyond, "beyond the beyond" in Moten and Harney's apt terminology, we
have to give ourselves over to a certain kind of craziness. Moten
reminds us that even as Fanon took an anti-colonial stance, he knew that
it "looks crazy" but, Fanon, as a psychiatrist, also knew not to accept
this organic division between the rational and the crazy and he knew
that it would be crazy for him not to take that stance in a world that
had assigned to him the role of the unreal, the primitive and the wild.
Fanon, according to Moten, wants not the end of colonialism but the end
of the standpoint from which colonialism makes sense. In order to bring
colonialism to an end then, one does not speak truth to power, [one has
to inhabit the crazy, nonsensical, ranting language of the other, the
other who has been rendered a nonentity]{.underline} by colonialism.
Indeed, blackness, for Moten and Harney by way of Fanon, is the
willingness to be in the space that has been abandoned by colonialism,
by rule, by order. Moten takes us there, saying of Fanon fnally:
"Eventually, I believe, he comes to believe in the world, which is to
say the other world, where we inhabit and maybe even cultivate this
absence, this place which shows up here and now, in the sovereign's
space and time, as absence, darkness, death, things which are not (as
John Donne would say)." The path to the wild beyond is paved with
refusal. In The Undercommons if we begin anywhere, [we begin with the
right to refuse what has been refused to you.]{.underline} Citing
Gayatri Spivak, Moten and Harney call this refusal the "frst right" and
it is a game-changing kind of refusal in that it signals the refusal of
the choices as ofered. We can understand this refusal in terms that
Chandan Reddy lays out in Freedom With Violence (2011) -- for Reddy, gay
marriage is the option that cannot be opposed in the ballot box. While
we can circulate multiple critiques of gay marriage in terms of its
institutionalization of intimacy, when you arrive at the ballot box, pen
in hand, you only get to check "yes" or "no" and the no, in this case,
could be more damning than the yes. And so, you must refuse the choice
as ofered. Moten and Harney also study what it would mean to refuse what
they term "the call to order." And what would it mean, furthermore, THE
WILD BEYOND 9 to refuse to call others to order, to refuse
interpellation and the reinstantiation of the law. [When we
refuse]{.underline}, Moten and Harney suggest[, we create dissonance and
more importantly, we allow dissonance to continue]{.underline} -- when
we enter a classroom and we refuse to call it to order, we are allowing
study to continue, dissonant study perhaps, disorganized study, but
study that precedes our call and will continue after we have left the
room. [Or, when we listen to music, we must refuse the idea that music
happens only when the musician enters and picks up an
instrument]{.underline}; music is also the anticipation of the
performance and the noises of appreciation it generates and the speaking
that happens through and around it, making it and loving it, being in it
while listening. And so, when we refuse the call to order -- the teacher
picking up the book, the conductor raising his baton, the speaker asking
for silence, the torturer tightening the noose -- we refuse order as the
distinction between noise and music, chatter and knowledge, pain and
truth. Tese kinds of examples get to the heart of Moten and Harney's
world of the undercommons -- the undercommons is not a realm where we
rebel and we create critique; [it is not a place where we "take arms
against a sea of troubles/and by opposing end them." The undercommons is
a space and time which is always here.]{.underline} Our goal -- and the
"we" is always the right mode of address here -- is not to end the
troubles but to end the world that created those particular troubles as
the ones that must be opposed. Moten and Harney refuse the logic that
stages refusal as inactivity, as the absence of a plan and as a mode of
stalling real politics. [Moten and Harney tell us to listen to the noise
we make and to refuse the offers we receive to shape that noise into
"music."]{.underline} In the essay that many people already know best
from this volume, "The University and the Undercommons," Moten and
Harney come closest to explaining their mission. Refusing to be for or
against the university and in fact marking the critical academic as the
player who holds the "for and against" logic in place, Moten and Harney
lead us to the "Undercommons of the Enlightenment" where subversive
intellectuals engage both the university and fugitivity: "[where the
work gets done, where the work gets subverted, where the revolution is
still black, still strong]{.underline}." The subversive intellectual, we
learn, is unprofessional, uncollegial, passionate and disloyal. The
subversive intellectual is neither trying to extend the university nor
change the university, the subversive intellectual is not toiling in
misery and from this place of misery articulating a "general
antagonism." In fact, the subversive intellectual enjoys the ride and
wants it to be faster and wilder; she does not want a room of his or her
own, she wants to be in the world, in the world with others and making
the world anew. Moten insists: "Like Deleuze. I believe in the world and
want to be in it. I want to be in it all the way to the end of it
because [I believe in another world in the world and I want to be in
that]{.underline}. And I plan to stay a believer, like Curtis Mayfeld.
But that's beyond me, and even beyond me and Stefano, and out into the
world, the other thing, the other world, t[he joyful noise of the
scattered, scatted eschaton, the undercommon refusal of the academy of
misery."]{.underline}

#### Temporal and Spacial categories suggest that the black woman speaks the language of time and space; it ignores that black women have many languages some that aren't always tied to the tongue. We speak with our bodies our songs and our voices.

Talladega College, hosted by the Omegas, Kappas, Sigmas, Alphas. Dr.
Ruth Nicole knows dance too. [[She dances with her girls, their
mamas,and the other teachers in the room.]{.underline}]{.mark} She
probably dances with her self. I think [[a Black woman who dances with
her self is probably some kind of unspoken Black girl tradition, no
matter what part of the country we hail from]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Those of us, who love to dance, cannot always wait for a partner to
come and take our hand. The music is there, the drapes are closed or
not, the one who loves to move must have her way with
it]{.underline}]{.mark}. Dr. Ruth Nicole is not afraid of dance or its
power, language or meaning. Turn some pages in Black Girlhood
Celebration and she will tell you herself that to dance is to be fierce
arid free in the body that brought one here to earth.With dance as her
instruction manual, Dr. Ruth Nicole, is teaching Black girls to not be
afraid of their bodies[[. Images of the Solhot girls and women dancing,
remind me, so deeply, of myoid old love for this Black woman sacred
movement]{.underline}.]{.mark} But why did I have to be reminded? How
did I ever let it go? I was the young girl-poet known for writing poems
beneath hundred-year-old oaks by day and closing down dances in the
upper Lounge by night. When did I allow the gaze of the outside world to
make me hyper-conscious of my love for dancing? I was the young woman
poet who left the dances in the Upper Lounge of Talladega College
drenched, spent, and smiling. I appreciated dance so much before I moved
into the un-dancing Academy. There are things whispered, by well-dressed
power brokers in some professional environments that should be
considered a kind of murder, \"You can\'t dance like that\--out in
public-and be taken seriously in this life\--or receive tenure.\" The
moment I abandoned the dance floor, I also abandoned some core element
of my Black girl self. Pinky swear. [[Dancing is Solhot\'s way of
saying; I am here. I will not compromise who I am. I love who I am. See
me. This is my body that I am moving. I know I look good. I know I feel
good.]{.underline}]{.mark} You [can\'t make me feel bad about this body
moving in this way.]{.mark} This is my Black classical tradition. Step
back. I\'m about to represent. Dance is widely known as one of the forms
of Black expression that has unquestionably survived Afrophobia. In
1995, only a few months before her death, Toni Cade Bambara, who had
never ever used the word \"mentor\" in my presence or direction, but who
had regularly invited many of us in the Atlanta community, to sit
together, to talk openly about writing, sent me a postcard from her
hospice bed. She had just received a copy of my second book of poetry,
RICE. The one line postcard read: \"Do Not Leave the Arena To the
fools.\" Her passionate entreaty to me: [[Write, Black Girl! Spin your
words out onto the page until they enter the larger world circle. Don\'t
let anyone think they can have their \"important\" conversations without
you, present and accounted for.]{.underline}]{.mark}

# BODY WITHOUT ORGANS

#### The body has been dismembered---organ sales have divided the world into designated donors and designated receivers; People of color and the poor have been marked for donation. The literal bodily arm has been sold. The multimillion-dollar medical industry reduces people to the value of their parts and enforces societal hierarchies to determine who is worthy and who isn't; the worthy become organ receivers and the unworthy become organ suppliers. It creates a lifeboat where some can get in and join the waitlist for organs, some will get pushed off, and some people will be eaten by those deemed worthy in an effort to ensure the continuation of privileged life. The idea of 'altruism' in organ donation is false, as those who are typically asked to donate organs are largely those who won't ever receive organs, since in order to receive an organ, one needs to be affluent and healthy. This simultaneously creates an organ market where often excess organs are discarded and wasted in order to prevent competition from getting them. This creates an artificial scarcity that leads to organ theft. Bodies flow from hospitals and prisons to banks and biotech companies where those parts are then sold for profit Organ theft happens even when organs are "gifted" as people are told they are giving their or their loved ones' organs to charity and those same organs end up sold for profit. This voids the consent and autonomy of the person or their families. As the sale occurs, people become commodities worth only the value of their parts. The goal of medicine becomes the sale of the organ and not the interest of the family and/or the individual and this results in psychological manipulation of those in emotionally precarious positions. Organ transfer no longer occurs among kin for the privileged and has moved to areas of high risk where little is known or discussed of the suffering of a hidden population.

Biopolitics: Race, Class, and Ethnicity in Organs Procurement [There is
little consciousness of the vulnerability of some social classes and
ethnic groups who can be described as [the \"designated donor\"]{.mark}
populations.]{.underline} In the United States, this group is
disproportionately poor\--including whites, Latinos, and African
Americans. The poor are over-represented in the intensive care centers
(ICUs) of large urban hospitals, due to their disproportionate exposure
to urban violence, the higher rates of suicide and vehicular death in
their communities, and the cumulative effects of societal and medical
neglect. [The great irony is that [those lacking]{.mark} public
[insurance]{.mark} (44 million citizens) [also comprise]{.mark} the
greatest number of [those whose family members are asked to]{.mark} be
altruistic and [voluntarily donate]{.mark} the organs and [tissues of
loved ones]{.mark}. That a great many of these families refuse to donate
should come as no surprise. They are being asked to give organs to
support a social and medical system that excludes them and within which
they would have a lower probability of receiving an organ, should that
need arise. [One needs to be]{.mark} relatively [affluent and]{.mark}
otherwise healthy and well looked after [to be recommended for organ
transplant]{.mark}.]{.underline} Widespread refusal to donate among poor
Latino and African Americans is a political act of considered
resistance. Meanwhile, across the globe, medical human rights workers in
the West Bank complained of gross violations of Palestinian **\[End Page
66\]** bodies by Israeli pathologists at the National Legal Medical
Institute in Tel Aviv. An official investigation committee appointed by
the Minister of Health confirmed the suspicions of Palestinian health
workers. The harvested organs and tissues were sold by the Institute to
hospitals and medical centers for surgical procedures, research, and
medical teaching. A special \"squad\" of surgeons on military reserve
duty performs the harvesting. This practice was established by the head
of the national skin bank, who was formerly also Chief Medical Officer
of the Israeli Defense Forces. Relying on \"presumed consent\" the staff
of the Forensic Institute and the surgeons who illegally harvested skin
and organs said that they believed they were helping to save lives, and
that this was more important than trying to procure the consent of
ill-informed and grieving family members. As elsewhere, tissues and
organs were regarded as mere detachable objects that could be
transformed into something valuable. Some bodies were, however, exempt
from this practice, namely the bodies of Israeli soldiers, which are
returned intact to their families for burial. Invented Scarcities\--The
Slide to Living Organ Donation and Medical Tourism Sadly, however, [the
discourse on [scarcity conceals the]{.mark} actual existence of excess
and [wasted organs that end up in]{.mark} hospital [dumpsters]{.mark} on
a daily basis throughout those parts of the world where the necessary
infrastructure to use them is lacking]{.underline}. Indeed, the ill will
and competitiveness of some hospital workers and medical professionals
also contributes to the production of organ \"wastage.\" For example,
[transplant [coordinators]{.mark} in public hospitals in many developing
countries [are]{.mark} often [told to dispose]{.mark} of usable [organs
rather than allow the competition to \"get their hands on
them]{.mark}.\" The very idea of organ \"scarcity\" is what Ivan Illich
would call an artificially created need, invented by transplant
technicians and dangled before the eyes of an ever-expanding sick,
aging, and dying population. The resulting artificially created organs
scarcity is \"misrecognized\" as a natural medical phenomenon.
[4](http://muse.jhu.edu/article/30587#FOOT4) In this environment of
\"survivalist\" utilitarian pragmatics, the ethics of transplantation is
modeled after classical \"lifeboat\" ethics.
[5](http://muse.jhu.edu/article/30587#FOOT5)]{.underline} **[With
[ethical presumptions of scarcity]{.mark}, there appears to be clear
[cho\[os\]]{.mark}es to be made, namely [who gets into the
lifeboat]{.mark} (\"getting on the waiting list\"); who will be shoved
off the boat when it gets overcrowded (getting triaged while on the
waiting list); and who will, in the end, \[End Page 67\] be \"eaten\" so
that others may live (race and class disparities in organs procurement
and distribution practices).]{.underline}** A new kind of organ trade
has emerged out of the global economy: transplant tourism. Along with
it, a group of self-defined transplant outlaws\--doctors, patients,
brokers, and kidney sellers\--has emerged. They short-circuit national
waiting lists and make a mockery of national and international codes of
ethics prohibiting the sale of organs, from either living or dead
donors. [The key actors are a new class of entrepreneurial organs
brokers, who take advantage of questionable organs scarcity panics and
the desperation of both the organs buyers and the organs sellers. The
sellers are recruited from populations that are suffering from economic
transitions. These include displaced rural populations, guest workers,
refugees, and young soldiers.Supplying the Market Through Biopiracy:
Tissues Procurement Practices Drawing on widely sited ethnographic field
research, Organs Watch has investigated international organs buying,
selling, and transplantation in an effort to document the impact of the
organs market on the bodies of some of the most vulnerable citizens of
the new world order.]{.underline} Organs Watch researchers have followed
transplant patients from dialysis clinics to meetings with brokers in
suburban shopping malls, and into illicit surgeries. They have also
visited the township *shabeens*, squatter camps, and city jails where
people are most likely to sell their organs, sometimes in \"organs
motels\" inside private hospitals. [They have seen [dead bodies flow
from]{.mark} hospital [morgues and]{.mark} police [mortuaries to the
tissue banks and biotech companies where their parts are harvested and
processed]{.mark}\--often for sale. All of this field research confirms
the existence of a new form of \"[apartheid medicine\"]{.mark} that
[privileges one class of patients]{.mark}, [o]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### The topic has been dismembered by ignoring the valuable question of arms already sold -- this undergirds the discussion of impacts such as biological colonialism and desire. The organ market mines people for resources and colonizers strip the colonized to bodies whose lives matter only in their ability to sustain privileged white life

[[The]{.mark} living human [bodies of the poor are]{.mark} increasingly
[looked upon by the]{.mark} rich and [powerful as resources]{.mark} ripe
[for the mining]{.mark}]{.underline}. As regular readers of SHS know:
Ounce for ounce, human eggs have become the world's most valuable
commodity with eugenically correct young women able to garner tens of
thousands of dollars for ten or fifteen eggs that could barely be seen
by the human eye, occasionally leaving the sellers dead, disabled, or
infertile. If human cloning succeeds, the egg commodities market will
shoot through the roof and become international as egg merchants scour
the destitute for the tens of thousands of eggs needed to fill the
cloners' orders. [China tissue matches prisoners with buyers and kills
the former to fill the organ orders of the latter. In India, the uteri
of desperately poor women are rented for gestation, and the child taken
or not retrieved by the biological parents depending on whether they
like the product. And around the world, poor people sell their kidneys
to the rich, sometimes with deadly consequences]{.underline}.
Bloomberg's Michael Smith has an excellent investigative piece out about
the organ trade, headlined, "Desperate Americans Buy Organs from the
Poor." (Bad headline: It should read, Desperate Destitute Sell their
Organs to the Rich," subhead, "Transactions Can be Deadly.") [From the
story: Luis Picado's mother remembers the day her son thought he had won
the lottery. He came home to their tin-roofed cinder-block house in a
Managua, Nicaragua, slum and said he'd found a way to escape poverty and
start a new life in the United States. An American man had promised to
give Picado, a 23-year-old high school dropout who worked as a
construction laborer, a job and an apartment in New York if he'd donate
one of his kidneys.]{.underline} He jumped at the deal, his mother says.
Three weeks later, in May 2009, [Picado came out of surgery at Managua's
Military Hospital, bleeding internally from the artery doctors had
severed]{.underline} to remove his kidney, according to medical records.
His mother, Elizabeth Tercero, got on her knees next to her son's bed in
the recovery room and prayed, Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its
June issue. "I told my boy not to worry, that I would take care of him,"
Tercero, 49, says. "But it was too late." [Picado bled to death as
doctors tried to save him]{.underline}, according to a coroner's report.
"He was always chasing the American dream, and finally, it cost him his
life," she says. Yea, like the buyer would have paid off[. [Biological
colonialism is a growing problem: In the]{.mark} illegal [organ trade,
brokers]{.mark} scour the world's slums, [preying on the poor with
promises]{.mark} of easy money and little risk in exchange for a kidney.
Inside hospitals, people are injured or killed by botched surgery as
doctors place money above ethics]{.underline}, criminal investigators
say. [In Colombia, 321 foreigners got transplants from 2005 to
2010]{.underline}, according to the country's National Health Institute.
Juan Lopez, a doctor who oversees Colombia's organ transplant system as
director of the NHI, says [many of these surgeries are driven by profit
for hospitals, doctors and brokers]{.underline}. "I don't want my
country to be a Mecca for transplant tourism," Lopez says. He's gone to
court to try to stop 23 organ transplants for foreigners since 2010, he
says. In Peru, Rafael Peraldo, a taxi driver who's under investigation
for being an organ broker, has plied Lima's dusty slums since at least
2005, according to five people who say in interviews that they sold
kidneys to him. Peraldo paid as little as \$5,000, the five people say.
Patients who bought these organs paid as much as \$150,000, prosecutors
have found. "[The poor have become a spare-parts bank for the well-to-
do]{.underline}," says University of California, Berkeley,
anthropologist Nancy Scheper-Hughes, who specializes in organ
trafficking. The Peruvian National Prosecutor's Office is investigating
61 transplants in seven of Lima's top hospitals since 2004, documents in
the case show. Peraldo is one of 150 brokers, doctors, nurses and others
under investigation, says Jesus Asencios, the prosecutor leading the
probe. Peraldo says in a telephone interview that he's done nothing
wrong; he says he won't say more until the investigation is completed.
The story also notes that the buyers could run into problems, such as
HIV, etc. That should warn them away from mining for kidneys, but our
emphasis should be on protecting the victims. The time has come for the
international community to outlaw this practice and make it prosecutable
for buyer and organ merchants, whether in the home country or that of
the purchaser. Doctors and hospitals found to have knowingly
participated or intentionally failed to learn what they did not want to
know also have to be held accountable. (That applies double here in the
USA where poor Israelis were brought over for organ sales, which I don't
believe could have happened without some knowing medical participation.)
[The poor have a tough enough time without being mined for their organs.
Living [human beings should never be reduced to the equivalent of a
commodity.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Organ suppliers' bodies become commodified as the theft occurs, and what is physical part of the seller is sold against their will. The transfer of organs becomes a transfer of property and thus a transfer of power, authority, and control. Exploitation is an attack on self-ownership. This is the site of the arm sale where power in the form of self-ownership is stolen from organ suppliers, and sold to organ receivers. While organ sellers may, and often do actively make the choice to sell their own organs, these choices happen in the absence of other viable options. The question is not whether this choice is ethical, instead we must question the system that makes this choice possible. BY recognizing organ suppliers as those who have value outside of the value of their organs, and stopping the sale of that self-ownership, we make a necessary rejection of the objectification of donors that is central to the commercial organ market and thus take the first step in its destruction. We intervene at the moment organ suppliers give up self-ownership and we stop the sale before the exchange of living parts of a person as a commodity

**Hughes'98** (Hughes, P. M. (1998). Exploitation, autonomy, and the
case for organ sales. International Journal of Applied
Philosophy, 12(1), 89-95.)

[The intuition at the root of accusations of exploitation is often the
general concern that someone or some group is being unjustly taken
advantage of. This is the essence too of the traditional Marxist
complaint about exploitation in]{.underline} 92 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF
APPLIED PHILOSOPHY [capitalism. The Marxist notion of exploitation is
ambiguous, with some passages in the Marxian corpus apparently asserting
that exploitation is a justice-based notion denoting the unfair way in
which capitalists take advantage of the politically and economically
weaker position of the proletariat.]{.underline} At other times, Marx
seems to mean by exploitation something more value neutral and
technical, as when one builds a dam to harness the power of a river and
thus \"uses\" the waterway for purposes of generating electricity. But
the root of Marx\'s concerns about exploitation is that workers in
capitalism are exploited in the sense that they sell their labor power
for a wage, but then produce over and above the value of that wage, thus
creating what Marx refers to as \"surplus value.\" This surplus value is
the capitalist\'s \"profit.\" The usual interpretation of the injustice
of capitalist exploitation is thus that capitalists get something for
nothing. As G.A. Cohen has recently argued, [[exploitation]{.mark} in
the Marxist sense [is an assault on self-ownership]{.mark}, since
workers own their bodies and their labor power but when they produce
surplus value for capitalists their labor is in effect
\"forced]{.underline}.\"**[7 Recalling that [selfownership is
the]{.mark} bedrock moral [intuition behind respect for personal
autonomy]{.mark}, at least in Dworkin\'s argument in favor of a market
in organs, it follows that [exploitation is a violation of personal
autonomy]{.mark}. So, [if a market in organs exploits the poor, it does
so by violating their autonomy.]{.mark}]{.underline}** This
interpretation of Marxian exploit tation, then, not only explains the
origin of profits in capitalism, it is necessarily related to the notion
that a worker\'s choice to labor for a capitalist is \"constraining\" in
the following sense. [Exploitation is not just what happens when a
worker labors in a factory for a wage, it\'s what happens to make that
happen. In other words, exploitation involves the background set of
options which impel worker\'s to \"choose\" to labor for
capitalists.]{.underline} Similarly, when we are reminded that women
still earn on average only sixty seven cents to the dollar compared with
men in comparable occupations, or that migrant farm workers or illegal
aliens earn far less than the federal minimum wage in California
orchards or New York \"sweat shops,\" we are being told that these
groups of people are in political and economic circumstances that enable
them to be used to benefit others not in such restrictive circumstances.
What is meant by the notion of \"using\" such people is not merely that
they are underpaid and overworked. To be sure, this is part of the
problem of exploitation. But the rest of the story is that the
reasonable alternatives available to them are so limited that the
addition of certain kinds of options may have a debilitating impact on a
person\'s autonomy and well-being. Consider, for example, the legal
option of refraining from pressing charges against one\'s assailant.
This is usually regarded as part of the arsenal of choices persons need
in order to be genuinely in control of their lives. But it has been
amply demonstrated that some persons, most notably adult victims of
domestic assault and battery, routinely exercise this option in
self-defeating ways, sometimes irrevocably SO.8 Thus, [[the presence of
some choices in contexts of injustice actually compromises autonomy and
well-being.]{.mark} Moreover, if we think of a person\'s viable options
as his real autonomy, then [the presentation of]{.mark} additional
[choices]{.mark} THE CASE FOR ORGAN SALES 93 [which are
constraining]{.mark} will [leave a person worse off in terms of autonomy
and well being]{.mark} than he would have been without those
choices]{.underline}. The general point about Marxian exploitation is
that [[if]{.mark} people\'s options are constrained by unjust economic
arrangements or racial or gender bias, or [their set of viable options
is significantly smaller than it would otherwise be because of]{.mark}
these and other [systemic injustices, then the victims]{.mark} of such a
system [are]{.mark} plausibly regarded as [less autonomous to begin with
than those who benefit from the injustice]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
Consequently, additional choices which presuppose and/ or reinforce the
status quo may be incompatible with genuine autonomy. This is a reality
Dworkin ignores when he claims that injustice is independent of
autonomy.9 He asserts that There are certainly objections of justice to
the current highly unequal income distributions. But it seems to me
paternalistic in the extreme, given that injustice, to deny poor people
choices which they perceive as increasing their well-being. 10 Three
points are especially germane here. First, Dworkin\'s point about
paternalism assumes that the economic inequality of capitalism is
unfair, but as I\'ve just argued, given that injustice, personal
autonomy and well-being will be radically different for different people
depending on their position as oppressor or oppressed, beneficiary or
victim, of that injustice. Consequently, any proposed additional choices
must be mapped onto existing unjust inequalities to determine whether
and to what extent they really do enhance a person\'s autonomy.
Secondly, whether poor people perceive a market in body organs as
\"increasing their well-being\" is an empirical question. Perhaps they
do not. The possibility that such a choice may cause psychic distress
for those whose economic plight is so desperate that they feel they must
seriously consider selling a bodily organ to survive is one Dworkin
acknowledges but dismisses as not serious enough to outweigh the good
created by such a market. But surely [someone who feels compelled by
dire economic circumstances to sell illegal drugs, or prostitute him or
herself, or even take in other people\'s laundry or clean others\'
toilets for a living does not necessarily view such options as
\"increasing\" their well-being. Rather, it may well be perceived as a
necessary evil; as a choice that makes their already miserable lives
even worse by requiring that they degrade themselves in order to put
food on the table. Third, [even if poor people do perceive the option of
selling an organ as an increase in their liberty, it hardly follows that
the availability of such an option is an increase in personal
autonomy]{.mark}. The phenomenon of \"false consciousness,\" a process
by which people sometimes misrepresent reality in an effort to cope with
otherwise intolerable conditions, may be especially applicable to cases
like this where those who are the least well off economically in a
society which prizes economic status are the most likely to miscalculate
the benefits and drawbacks of securing ready cash in exchange for a
bodily organ.]{.underline} Though it would be implausible to analogize
wholly from the Marxist diagnosis of the plight of the proletariat in
early industrial capitalism to the impact of a market in organs on the
poor in contemporary Western democracies like ours, the point is [that
to allow a market in organs is to take advantage 94 INTERNATIONAL
JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHILOSOPHY of the already highly constrained set of
options of the least well off members of society. In short, [what
appears to be an increase in autonomy and wellbeing for such persons may
actually be an increase in vulnerability, hence the propriety of the
term \"exploitation\" as a kind of \"taking advantage of\" the weakness
of others.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### We affirm the body without organs. This means we can unravel wholeness; the idea that we have to do anything; that bodies are only valuable in their ability to do. We affirm emptiness. Our response to a world where organs are stolen is to move to a world without organs. Designated donors don't have a choice in whether or not their organs get stolen. It is our duty to reject a schema dependent on coherence, consolidation, and wholeness, embrace an assemblage of disparate elements. The root of control is the ability to seize the work done by organs; our affirmation allows us to be unproductive, unengendered; un-consumable

pollutes the relationships we have with one
another]{.underline}]{.mark}. He concisely brings out the real,
devastating and (for the foreseeable future) inescapable consequences of
the fiction of race--the social reality of the invented category--and he
points out the privileged asymmetry through which people marked as white
can pretend to escape white-supremacy (this is the other side of the
burden of knowledge that Baldwin and Coates elegantly describe). I
encourage you to read TJ's post in its entirety, but I will quote the
opening here: Sometimes I wonder if white people know what a constant
state of grace and forbearance they get from people of color every day.
I think so many white folk like to imagine that they're the "good ones,"
that they don't do fucked up or racist things, and that they're not bad
and wouldn't seek to marginalize or hurt POC ever. But honestly, we live
in a society where things are tilted for you every damn day. At any
point, any of you can turn on us. Lovers, friends, family, colleagues.
Any of you. [As TJ and I discussed yesterday, this is,]{.underline} in
some ways, [a statement of our general human condition]{.underline}:
goodness isn't a location you can arrive at or an object you can come to
possess. Goodness is an active principle, and you are only ever as good
as your present actions. Hannah Arendt describes human qualities like
goodness, courage, etc. as "virtues" in Machiavelli's sense of virtue:
goodness (etc.) is an action performed among other human beings, and you
are only good when you are giving a virtuosic performance. Jay Smooth
puts it more simply: being good (being anti-racist, for instance) is
like brushing your teeth; you have to do it every day. Going back to
TJ's terminology, [[there are no good white people because you have to
perform your role as an ally every day. You never arrive at the point
where you don't have to think about it or where you can be a little bit
racist]{.mark} because you earned your "good white person"
badge]{.underline}. The reality of that continuous responsibility comes
through with painful clarity in TJ's point that "[[At any point, any of
you can turn]{.underline}]{.mark} on us." If you think being constantly
on your toes as a white ally sounds demanding, [imagine being a person
of color who can be betrayed by allies and intimates at any
moment.]{.underline} If white allies live under a constant moral
imperative, people of color live under a constant threat of injury that
could arrive without warning from any direction. **[[White supremacy is
racial terrorism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, even in its most genteel forms;
[[it shapes lives through the threat of violence, even when things
appear calm.]{.underline} [As white allies, we have to recognize that
**whiteness is a weapon.** We are born with this weapon, we cannot put
it down, and we injure people with it when we forget it is in our hands.
The national (and international) structures of white supremacy gave us
these weapons to use for our own benefit]{.underline}]{.mark}. [It
designed the weapon of whiteness to]{.underline} hobble people of color
and [give us an advantage over them in life.]{.underline} [[**It
designed its weapon to** exploit, control and **destroy black bodies for
the benefit of white people**]{.underline}]{.mark}. We can renounce
those designs and live our lives against the grain of white supremacy,
but--and this is a tragedy for everyone involved--[[as long as we live
within an environment structured by white supremacy, we cannot put the
weapon down]{.mark}.]{.underline} We cannot put it down because we are
the weapon: [the structure of [white supremacy engraves whiteness into
our bodies]{.mark}, and we cannot escape our
bodies[.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[We live within/as the weapon of
whiteness]{.mark}.]{.underline} We do not have to use our whiteness to
attack others, but, even when we do not use it to intentionally,
whiteness threatens to wound those around us the moment we get careless.
Worse than that, [the weapon of whiteness is a threat even when we are
mindful and careful and conscientious]{.underline}. It is a threat
because, as TJ points out, any one of us can turn on our friends,
family, lovers, etc. at any moment, even if we don't mean to do it[. [No
degree of enlightenment or number of good deeds will sheath the blade of
our whiteness or make it incapable of injuring
others]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} Because we carry and will
always carry this destructive weapon with us, [[we must dedicate
ourselves to mindfulness, to care, and to gratitude for the grace and
forbearance we receive from the PoC who stay with us knowing that we
will hurt them]{.underline}]{.mark}. (As TJ and I discussed last night,
a similar structure also applies to relationships between men and women
in partriarchal environments, to cis-gendered people in transphobic
environments, etc.)

#### The lethality of the weapons of whiteness are best seen when the state buys this arm in the form of white cops to kill, arrest, and control black folks. Racial terror acts to distort the real: we always find some way of justifying the unjustifiable, there's always a gun for black folks to reach for, always some threat to be fabricated after the fact, accepted by all forms of power only because of the inescapable hold that white bigots, who are seemingly incapable of conceptualizing the horrifically unethical implications of their actions, have on every means of justice. In particular, the mass arrest of black folks acts as a way of utilizing the military power of whiteness, by protecting the supposed white community via the employment of literal loose cannons in Black ones. This tautologically dehumanizes Black folks to they're pure use value -- the white catachrestic fantasy arms itself to exploit Black folks, who's adamant existence beyond their assigned role as the exploited becomes an implicit threat against whiteness, demanding the mobilization of the violent capabilities of white supremacy. In this manner, the fungibility of black flesh is foundational to the white Symbolic order. We are trained to view Black flesh as the ultimate commodity. As Hartman articulates, "the fungibility of the commodity makes the captive body an abstract and empty vessel vulnerable to the projection of others' feelings, ideas, desires, and values."[^1] The ways in which whiteness is weaponized to maintain white supremacy does not limit itself to the carceral state, but manifests in the exportation of the racialized, emancipating, military. This manifests in initiatives like AFRICOM, where the military seeks to emancipate whole swaths of Africa from the perceived toils of the instability caused by colonialism, in favor psychologically violent forms of Enlightenment era governance. In this structure of whiteness, we become desensitized to even most horrific impacts of these systems of power, Black social and physical death. How many images of ruined towns, destroyed by US bombs, must we see to demand change? How many videos of white cops killing Black folks? How many corpses? Ruined lives? This hyper-reality of anti-blackness demands a reconfiguration of the ways in which we seek to abolish whiteness. How do we intertwine the epistemological demand to rupture the White symbolic order and our ethical duty to aid in the prevention of white people materially and ontologically terrorizing black folks with the arm we are born with, whiteness?

#### To answer this, Georgetown MW co-conspires with Blackness to substantially reduce arms sales from the US

#### The resolution is a product of the white fantasy. The very people that voted on the resolution created it in order to only address existential threats that threaten them. That discussion seeks to maintain the white fantasy by limiting out and controlling any discussions that are deemed threatening to white Symbolic order, namely the in the way it limits out the most dangerous weapon, whiteness. That demands that any resolutional affirmative make a reinvestment into the precise forms of fucked up whiteness that seeks to endlessly terrorize Black folks, both materially and ontologically. The resolution creates the white fantasy and enticement of staying within dominant, oppressive white subjectivities with a plan that reaffirms our own whiteness, particularly in the way the static presence of "the USfg should" normalizes the notion that the only form of resistance is 'civil' legal action. This assumption of the proper forms of resistance causes additional terrorizing of black folks in the form of movement-based policing, where the state is justified in crushing any group deemed to uncivil. In this manner, whiteness has been projected through debate. We renounce our whiteness. In an act of treason, we co-conspire with Blackness against the resolution to shatter the fantasy we have been complicit in since birth at its most vulnerable.

#### **White fantasy operates beyond a solely material oppression. The end goal of white supremacy has long been transmitted semiotically, via the historically incessant repetition of Black social and physical death, for the purpose of waging preemptive psychological warfare against Black radical movements. Even before technology allowed for the near instant spread of textual signs, whiteness disseminated its horrific forms of semiotic violence via the use of cartoons and images to articulate the worst forms of anti-blackness that exceed even the white supremacy's ability to rationalize.**

#### White hyper-realist fantasy sustains itself through the endless attempt to unsuture the threat to civil society Blackness represents from Black folks. Further, our incessant repetition of black death serves to constantly re-traumatize Black folks as a means of 'containing' and 'disarming' them. This ritualization of black death begs the question: What happens if, in the face of the white supremacist symbolic order, the gun stays cocked? When the missile remains primed? Can white Disneyland survive a bombing?

**[[Black life is lived in a white hyper-reality]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
By this I mean, [black life is lived inside a constituted [white fiction
which concretizes itself as fact]{.mark}]{.underline}. Black life is a
[life lived in non-existence]{.underline}; **[blackness "exists" as a
symbol of death]{.underline}** [that is, but is not. Blackness "exists"
only insofar as White Being structures it onto a map of anti-black
violence]{.underline}.4 Achille Mbembe corroborates this in his Critique
of Black Reason, stating: Racism consists, most of all, in substituting
what is with something else, with another reality. [[It has the power to
**distort the real**]{.mark} and to **fix affect**, but [it is]{.mark}
also a form of **[psychic derangement]{.mark}**, the mechanism through
which the repressed suddenly surfaces]{.underline}. When the racist sees
the Black person, he does not see that the Black person is not there,
does not exist, and is just a sign of a pathological fixation on the
absence of a relationship. We must therefore consider race as being both
beside and beyond being.5 [The reality that replaces that which *is* is
a **white hyper-reality**]{.underline}. [This white hyperrealism **fixes
blackness** as "a sign of a pathological fixation."]{.underline} [[White
hyper-realism is the **paradigm**]{.mark} [where]{.mark}by
**[consciousness is unable to distinguish between the fictions created
by White Being and the Rea]{.mark}l**]{.underline}. [It is [this]{.mark}
fact that [permits black death to be **subsumed in simulations**
by]{.mark} each and [every **(analytic)**]{.mark} [**encounter**]{.mark}
with Whiteness and the World.]{.underline} [Questions like, "Can the
Black suffer?"]{.underline} [and "Is it capable for the Black to be
wronged?" arise due to the **inability to access a grammar of
suffering**]{.underline} [to **communicate a harm**]{.underline} [that
has **never ended**, a harm that **can never end** without ending the
World itself]{.underline}. It is for this reason that [viral [videos of
black death, more than opening the possibility for liberal]{.mark}
notions of [justice]{.mark}]{.underline}, seem to [suture the
relationship between the mythical and the real that [perpetuates]{.mark}
itself through the reification of black [trauma]{.mark}. Black death,
more than deconstructing the **ontics of the Human**, seems to **extend
its hyper-reality**]{.underline}. [Black death makes it harder to
**distinguish white fictions** from any sense of real harm being done to
human flesh]{.underline}. [[The Black is meant to **experience its death
over and over**]{.mark} **and over again**; and the World itself
recycles all its fictions-as-the-Real]{.underline}. Put differently,
[the White World subjects the Black to perpetual, gratuitous
violence]{.underline}, and then uses that violence as evidence to
further suggest that the Black is not Human. For [how can a Human endure
such a thing?]{.underline} [The experience of gratuitous violence
**secures the semiotics of the white hyper-reality**]{.underline}.
**[[White Disneyland stays intact]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Blackness
exists at the nexus of fact and fiction, possibility and (non)value,
inclusion and exclusion]{.underline}. [Blackness is trapped **even in
saying it's trapped** because the "**trapped-ness**" of the Black
extends to locations where the diction and syntax of White "words don't
go.]{.underline}"6 The Black does not have the grammar to speak against
where and how it is trapped since [Blackness can only articulate itself
through the semiotics of Whiteness]{.underline}. [That]{.underline}
[**[White Being continues to center black death]{.underline}** [as the
**matrix of possibility** for its
**hyper-real**]{.underline}]{.mark}[**ist [structure]{.mark}** indexes
the **promise of death** insofar that **White Being is promised
futurity**]{.underline}. The Black was rendered fungible through the
conjunction of the political and the libidinal economy of the anti-Black
world. Blackness gave birth to the commodity and the economy of
signification that structures the cartography of the Human's
coordinates. This could be said to be a still birth, insofar as the
nature of Black life in a white hyper-reality is conducted on a plane
that guarantees natal alienation, social, and ontological death. [The
Black body **[lives to die]{.mark}**; the **[specter of death shadows it
everywhere]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [What matters crucially here, in our
invocation of the hyper-real, is the importance of the
Symbolic]{.underline}. The Symbolic is what "structures the libidinal
economy of civil society."7 The Symbolic here is understood as ["the
representational process" that structures "the **curriculum and order of
knowledge**"]{.underline} [and/or "the descriptive statement of the
human"]{.underline} in our contemporary World.8 And in this World, white
symbolism is everywhere. In fact, [in an **anti-Black paradigm**, white
symbolism is everything]{.underline}. [White symbolism
**over-determines** itself as the Symbolic itself, and denounces
anything that challenges its **genre-specific mode of
knowing**]{.underline}, seeing and understanding the World. In other
words, [white symbolism holds a **monopoly on the
Symbolic**]{.underline} [in ways that operate]{.underline}
"[lawlikely]{.underline} so [within the terms of their]{.underline}/our
order-specific [modes of]{.underline} adaptive cognition-for,
[truth-for]{.underline}."9 [There is no outside to
whiteness]{.underline}, to white semiotics, to white constructs of value
and reality, to white structuring of libidinal value. And for this
reason, like Wilderson, "\[I\] am more interested in the symbolic value
of Whiteness (and the absence of Blackness\'s value)..."10 in a world of
white hyper-reality. [[If Blackness is lived in the hyper-real, then
there is a hyper-intensification]{.mark}---an overrepresentation---of
semiology that dictates the coercive violence of the Black's
(non)existence.]{.underline} [**[The semiotics of White
Being]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} ]{.mark}[the factitious fiction
that **simulates the entire World**]{.underline}. [White Being and black
death are part of [a **globally blood-soaked symbolic exchange**
that]{.mark} has [extended itself over the]{.mark} terrain of the
[World]{.mark} to such an extent that there can be **no distinguishing**
between the **Real and the Non-Real**]{.underline}. White Being is that
Being for whom ontological capacity exists, whereas the Black is the
antithesis to Being, that fleshly matter whose essence is incapacity. 11
[If "language is the house of being,"]{.underline}12 as [Heidegger puts
it, then Blackness is trapped at the very center of White Being. Dionne
Brand puts it concisely when she writes, "We are people without a
translator. The language we use already contains our demise and any
response contains that demise as each response emboldens and strengthens
the language it hopes to undermine]{.underline}."13 This abject
positionality was codified through a violence so epochal that Modernity
itself can be said to have been inaugurated through it. **[However, at
the same time, "the center is, paradoxically, within the structure and
outside it."]{.underline}**14 That black death and anti-blackness exist
in this liminal positionality posits the impossible possibility of a
rupture in the moment. For **[that which is inside the structure, only
through being outside the structure, enables the possibility of both
sedimentation and disorientation]{.underline}**. Jacques Derrida writes,
"The function of this center was not only to orient; balance, and
organize the structure--- one cannot in fact conceive of an unorganized
structure---but above all to make sure that the organizing principle of
the structure would limit what we might call the freeplay of the
structure."15 If black death centers the structure, then it is somewhere
in the perfection and expansion of this antagonism (the inside-outside
antagonism) that the cartography of gratuitous anti-Black violence is
laid out. [What might happen when what **orients the structure** becomes
**insurgent**, **attacking the structure** through that **which centers
its very Being**]{.underline}? [[What might happen if **black death
became weaponized**]{.underline}]{.mark} in order
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} further **[[limit]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
freeplay of the structure---[[the **expansion of White
Being**]{.mark}?]{.underline}

#### Our position to this movement is not one of leadership or solidarity. Instead, we take the most ethical position we can, that of the co-conspirator. We co-conspire with Blackness, participating consensually within Black radical movements via the repurposing of the weapon of our privilege to destroy that which gave us this weapon, the white community, along with the weapon itself. To do this, we must pledge our willingness to destroy our identities as white, as taught to us by the white Symbolic order, for the white identity does not exist. This looks like standing in front of Black protesters because the police won't shoot at us, like intentionally making ourselves vulnerable to encourage the intimate, haptic forms of communing that allows the accomplice to know how to aid in the crime.

[I dislike, vehemently, the term ally]{.underline}. [[This is not to say
that I do not want white folks doing the work to dismantle white
supremacy]{.mark}, cis folks fighting transantagonism, or (cis) men
undoing male supremacist patriarchy. [Not at all.]{.mark}]{.underline}
All of this is absolutely welcome, to be sure. My beef, as it were, is
how "allyship" is mobilized in problematic ways---namely, as a way to
maintain and in fact foreground one's hegemonic identification. [[For
one to consistently tout their allyship]{.mark} and do that dance of
"acknowledging their privilege" [keeps intact the integrity of that
identity rather than doing the work to destroy it.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[To be an ally becomes a political identity in itself, and a somewhat
shallow one, as [it becomes the purview from which one does one's
politics: not as someone "in the struggle" but as someone outside the
struggle, cheering it on]{.mark} and shouting about how
white/cis/male/straight/etc./etc./etc. they are, [which
means]{.mark}---\*shrug\*---that [y'all do the work while I stand over
here watching]{.mark}]{.underline}. I showed a video to my Feminist
Essays class last semester interrogating the notion of allyship. It
provided a newer, more radical term for those typically known as allies:
accomplices. The aim, at least for me, is not to sway that the
aforementioned people should not be doing the subversive work they are
doing (to the extent that it in fact is subversive) but to place more of
a demand on them. Allies are still loved. We love us our white folks,
our cis men. Folks like William Lloyd Garrison, John Brown, the Grimke
sisters---yes, gimme them any day; gimme Tim Wise and Andrea Gibson.
They bring wreck to white and male supremacy---because they are
accomplices, co-conspiritors. [Accomplices are traitors to their
apparent epidermal (and gendered) allegiances. [Co-conspirators **uptake
the work that is entailed in the Black radical tradition**, a thoroughly
radical feminist tradition, and enact deviancy in spite of the coercion
to believe that are in fact rightfully at the top of the proverbial food
chain.]{.mark}]{.underline} [They occupy the "place of the demand," as
Kai M. Green puts it in our forthcoming conversation on the meeting
ground of Black feminism and trans feminism---that is, the fertile
ground on which [we must all do the radical, revolutionary work not only
from but despite and in excess of where we are. To be deemed an]{.mark}
accomplice, or alternatively, [**a co-conspirator**, means that **one
drives the getaway car** from the scene of the queer, feminist, Black
radical crime; it means that **one dwells in the deviancy with the
misfits and outlaws**]{.mark}]{.underline}. To be sure, this is
difficult work. [We will fail, succumb to the allure of normativity, be
seduced by hegemony, but [it is the perpetual taking up of the demand to
become and pursuit of becoming otherwise than the hegemonic selves we
are told we must believe we are (and will always be) that
**characterizes fugitive work of the co-conspiratorial
variety**]{.mark}]{.underline}. I've been told this does a disservice to
communities who wish to "self-segregate" into safe spaces away from
corporeal instantiations of the violent supremacies that exist.
"Allyship" has as a benefit that white folks, dudes, cis folks, and
straight folks know not to invade spaces designated strictly for a
specific marginalized demographic. I get this. And these spaces are
important. [My only response]{.underline}---an incomplete and thoroughly
inexhaustive response---[is to ask what it is that we wish to rally
around. How do we find coalition with others: on the grounds of hurt,
subjection to violence, historical trauma?]{.underline} [[Is it]{.mark}
also [possible to rally around]{.mark}, in the first instance, [our
commitment to undoing and dismantling hegemonic power]{.mark}? Can we
rally around, in the first instance (and not to the exclusion of other
points of connection, of which subjection or trauma might be one), the
kind of world in which we want to live? [Can we,]{.mark} finally, [rally
around how intensely we seek to bring this]{.mark} muhfucka [down, and
can that intensity become the means by which we find
kinship?]{.mark}]{.underline} [These are musings, and incomplete ones,
subject to change. But [as musings, they are provocations that]{.mark},
I hope, [are]{.mark} ultimately [in service of making the world
**livable for those who are said to have no life to live
here.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### The 1AC is a rupture of the White fantasy as a rejection of the resolution in that we escape the notion of white kids standing up and preaching about existential threats and fearmongering nuke war scenarios that can only be resolved by the benevolent state and don't presume death in the status quo. We think debate is sorely in need of white people rejecting their semiotic fantasies and the 1AC's repetition is desirable for to open the eyes of white people to their symbolic Disneyland. We don't claim to solve for antiblackness nor are we going to solve for all White fantasy but through this rupture within debate we hope to create positive cross-racial affinity. This orientation in opposition and abolishment of "the white community" is the only ethical orientation for any white person in debate.

#### **We co-conspire with Blackness to theorize material ways to weaponize our privilege and ability in service of the destruction of the end of arm sales. This necessarily means the discussion of how whiteness as a weapon and how white folks materially benefit from the deployment of this weapon. Blackness here does not mean being Black, but rather the jurisgenerative principle of that which escapes capture and embraces revolution. To utilize this to end arm sales, it requires both the rupture of the white Symbolic order intertwined with unconditional service to those who embody Blackness to resist the structures that militaristically terrorize black folks.**

It's also good timing that you wrote to me about this comment I made to
you in an earlier conversation because [I just finished a terrific book
called]{.underline} [*Dixie Be
Damned*](https://www.akpress.org/dixie-be-damned.html) [by Neal Shirley
and Saralee Stafford. They write about insurrections in the South from
the dismal swamp in the 18^th^ century to a 1975 uprising in a North
Carolina women's prison]{.underline}. It's stirring stuff and then in a
really sound, clear-hearted concluding chapter they surprised me. They
said **[[our enemies have been saved not by fascism but by
democracy.]{.underline}]{.mark}** It should not have surprised me, given
that we were just speaking about Du Bois and democratic despotism, but
it did. They are right. And I think it is in this sense that a better
university would be worse for us, has been worse for us, in a
paradoxical way. Some ask, 'Is another university possible?' Well, that
implies this one is possible but more than that it suggests another
university would be better for us. I don't know about that. This is not
to say I do not find work like that of Marc Bousquet and Chris Newfield
indispensable. I do. But [there is something at stake in Shirley and
Stafford's book and I want to talk with you about it because I think it
connects to your question about how the Undercommons book has been read
and used]{.underline}. [The authors quote Frank Wilderson on the way
**[blackness can never be disimbricated from the violence of
slavery.]{.mark}** Then they say: ['**Those who would risk extending
solidarity across racial boundaries would find themselves the recipient
of exemplary violence in order to instill fear of constant consequence
for this treason.**]{.mark} [**Ever after, *meaningful cross-racial
affinity can only be found in moments of revolutionary
violence*.**"]{.mark}]{.underline}  (Italics in the original.)Now this
is an historical observation on their part, but to some extent it is
also programmatic  for the authors. As an observation, well, they have
just convinced me of its validity in the last 250 pages, and as program,
well, [[I'm not a pacifist. **I'm for self-defense, and that can be
violent.**]{.mark} **But do words like solidarity, affinity, to say
nothing of the unlovely term allyship, accidentally preserve something
we want to abolish?**]{.underline} And I feel bad using Shirley and
Stafford to make this point because theirs is such a good book, but
maybe that's why I feel compelled to say, '[even here' this question
comes up]{.underline}. What I mean is [**who is this someone in
[solidarity with blackness,]{.mark} who is this ally of blackness, who
is this someone with affinity to black struggle**? I think this [means
that]{.mark} this [someone has his or her own struggles and is
indicating that now she or he wants to join not in common struggles, but
in the struggles of blackness.]{.mark} Because in a sense you have to
have your own thing to be an ally or to be in solidarity.]{.underline}
[Ok, but what are your own struggles from which you would be offering
solidarity, allyship, affinity?]{.underline} **[Are you organizing in
the white community, is that it? I think that is the
implication]{.underline}**, that you have been working in white
communities, and/or on the environment, or feminist issues, etc. But the
problem is, [**there's no such thing as a white community. [A white
community is a contradiction in terms]{.mark}**, an oxymoron. **[You
can't organize an oxymoron. The only thing you can do with a white
community is]{.mark} work to [abolish
it]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} Moreover [at that point of abolition
we may be able to say there is no such thing as a community, that a
community is an oxymoron. You can't commune and have a community.
[**Communing is anti-community. It's undercommon.** Maybe the only kind
of community that is possible is the maroon community, because it is by
definition not a community,]{.mark} and when in some historical
instances (of necessity even) it became one, it took on the same
murderous qualities of any]{.underline} [community]{.underline}. Okay,
so then the question arising, if you do abolish the white community,
what of the people who were marked as white, and in many cases who dwelt
in the supremacy of whiteness, what becomes of them? Well, in the
practice of abolition they will move closer to the only thing they ever
had that was about life and not death, about love and not hate,
blackness. **[This is to say, [people who present as white]{.mark} are
not allies, or in solidarity, or showing affinity, because they [have
nothing]{.mark} of their own, no place from which to show this, no
resource [to bring, unless and until they embrace the one thing of their
own they disown]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The thing that can't be owned
*born(e)* of the owned, [blackness.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [Now **white
people aren't coming with much blackness, by definition.** And this is
why the underlying humility motivating terms like ally, solidarity, and
affinity is not misplaced, if that is indeed what underlies their use in
practice. In any case, **[whiteness is either absence or violence,
and]{.mark} in either case, [not much to offer as an ally.]{.mark} But
on the other hand [white people have a big role to play]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark} the [revolutionary violence]{.mark} Shirley and Stafford
speak of **[because the act of abolition of white communities is a
monumental task.]{.mark}**]{.underline} By contrast and in a sense to
reverse while also honouring Wilderson's initial point, Black people
have for the very reason of this unrelenting violence and its brutal
failure, a lot of blackness, if I can put it that way, a special,
(under) privileged relationship to blackness, as Fred puts it. So
another way to think of the historical events Shirley and Stafford are
speaking about as cross-racial moments would be to think about these
events as moments in which there was not a total coincidence between
black people and blackness. In a way we could read moments of
non-coincidence as moments not of liberation from blackness but
generalization of blackness. But we have to be careful here.
**[Blackness is neither the opposite nor the total reversal or abolition
of whiteness.]{.underline}** [Blackness exists in/as the general
antagonism. It's always anti-colonial, always fugitive.]{.underline} So
what we tried to do in the book is to think about how [[study, and
planning,]{.mark} and logisticality, and hapticality [named capacities
for expanding]{.mark} the social poesis of blackness, of [the
anti-regulatory, jurisgenerative improvisation of the use of each
other.]{.mark}]{.underline} And we were thinking about how [[the
undercommons of study might be a place where those in blackness and
those coming into blackness might commune]{.mark}, might serve the debt
together, [in difference **but not separability**]{.mark}]{.underline},
as might say, not separability [from that quantum blackness that moves
across and against property, subjectivity, development,
usufruction.]{.underline} And if you want to say **[[this is going to be
a practice that is hard for a lot of people who do not experience the
lived fact of the coincidence of being a black person and blackness, and
it is going to be a humble practice, and even a practice of entering
into service,]{.mark} feeling in debt, [well that's okay, cause all of
that is what blackness is too. ]{.mark}]{.underline}**The book is just
trying to say this, in part from being in but not of the university and
its structural violence of anti-black racism and settler colonialism.

# INFILTRATION

#### Whiteness is a weapon - white supremacy always shapes our forms of interaction in ways that weaponize whiteness- the instutions of whiteness are designed to exploit and control black people for the benefit of white people- we live within the weapon, a weapon that can never be sheathed but can only be turned on itself.

**Immanentforms 15** (blog on American racial phenomena, "Whiteness is a
Weapon", Immanentforms: Thinking About it, August 21, 2015,
https://immanentforms.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/whiteness-is-a-weapon/)

I had an interesting conversation with TJ last night about a very
challenging post on his site titled, bluntly, "[[There are no 'good
white people]{.underline}.]{.mark}'" TJ is wrestling here with how [the
American (and European) concept of "whiteness" and the national
environment of [white-supremacy distorts all of us]{.mark}]{.underline}
(white people and PoC) [[as individuals and pollutes the relationships
we have with one another]{.underline}]{.mark}. He concisely brings out
the real, devastating and (for the foreseeable future) inescapable
consequences of the fiction of race--the social reality of the invented
category--and he points out the privileged asymmetry through which
people marked as white can pretend to escape white-supremacy (this is
the other side of the burden of knowledge that Baldwin and Coates
elegantly describe). I encourage you to read TJ's post in its entirety,
but I will quote the opening here: Sometimes I wonder if white people
know what a constant state of grace and forbearance they get from people
of color every day. I think so many white folk like to imagine that
they're the "good ones," that they don't do fucked up or racist things,
and that they're not bad and wouldn't seek to marginalize or hurt POC
ever. But honestly, we live in a society where things are tilted for you
every damn day. At any point, any of you can turn on us. Lovers,
friends, family, colleagues. Any of you. [As TJ and I discussed
yesterday, this is,]{.underline} in some ways, [a statement of our
general human condition]{.underline}: goodness isn't a location you can
arrive at or an object you can come to possess. Goodness is an active
principle, and you are only ever as good as your present actions. Hannah
Arendt describes human qualities like goodness, courage, etc. as
"virtues" in Machiavelli's sense of virtue: goodness (etc.) is an action
performed among other human beings, and you are only good when you are
giving a virtuosic performance. Jay Smooth puts it more simply: being
good (being anti-racist, for instance) is like brushing your teeth; you
have to do it every day. Going back to TJ's terminology, [there are [no
good white people because]{.mark} [you have to perform your role as an
ally every day]{.mark}. You never arrive at the point where you don't
have to think about it or where you can be a little bit racist because
you earned your "good white person" badge]{.underline}. The reality of
that continuous responsibility comes through with painful clarity in
TJ's point that "[At any point, any of you can turn]{.underline} on us."
If you think being constantly on your toes as a white ally sounds
demanding, [imagine being a person of color who can be betrayed by
allies and intimates at any moment.]{.underline} If white allies live
under a constant moral imperative, people of color live under a constant
threat of injury that could arrive without warning from any direction.
[**[White supremacy is racial terrorism]{.underline}**,]{.mark} even in
its most genteel forms; [it [shapes lives through the threat of
violence]{.mark}, even when things appear calm.]{.underline} [As [white
allies]{.mark}, we [have to recognize that **whiteness is a
weapon.**]{.mark} We are [born with this weapon]{.mark}, we [cannot put
it down,]{.mark} [and we injure people with it]{.mark}]{.underline} when
we forget it is in our hands. [The national (and international)
structures of [white supremacy gave us these weapons]{.mark} to use for
our own benefit]{.underline}. [It [designed the weapon of
whiteness]{.mark} to]{.underline} hobble people of color and [give us an
advantage over them in life.]{.underline} [**It designed its weapon [to
]{.mark}**[exploit, control and **destroy black bodies for the benefit
of white people**]{.mark}]{.underline}. We can renounce those designs
and live our lives against the grain of white supremacy, but--and this
is a tragedy for everyone involved--[as long as we live within an
environment structured by white supremacy, we cannot put the weapon
down.]{.underline} We cannot put it down because we are the weapon: [the
structure of [white supremacy engraves whiteness into our
bodies]{.mark}, and we cannot escape our bodies.]{.underline} [[We live
within]{.mark}/as the [weapon of whiteness]{.mark}.]{.underline} We do
not have to use our whiteness to attack others, but, even when we do not
use it to intentionally, whiteness threatens to wound those around us
the moment we get careless. Worse than that, [the [weapon of whiteness
is a threat even when we are mindful]{.mark} and careful and
conscientious]{.underline}. It is a threat because, as TJ points out,
any one of us can turn on our friends, family, lovers, etc. at any
moment, even if we don't mean to do it. [[No degree of
enlightenment]{.mark} or number of good deeds [will sheath the blade of
our whiteness]{.mark} [or make it incapable of injuring
others]{.mark}.]{.underline} Because we carry and will always carry this
destructive weapon with us, we must dedicate ourselves to mindfulness,
to care, and to gratitude for the grace and forbearance we receive from
the PoC who stay with us knowing that we will hurt them. (As TJ and I
discussed last night, a similar structure also applies to relationships
between men and women in partriarchal environments, to cis-gendered
people in transphobic environments, etc.)

#### Police are the mechanism whiteness utilizes to maintain dominance -- police proliferate into black and brown communities to demarcate them as zones of necropolitical exception- the unequal protection afforded based on race is part and parcel of necropolitics, as white communities receive "officer friendly" while black and brown communities receive violence.

IV\. WAR AT HOME On August 9, 2014, police in Ferguson, Missouri,
fatally shot an unarmed, black teenager, Michael Brown, and left
Brown\'s body facedown in the middle of Canefield Drive for four hours.
147 For four hours, Brown\'s lifeless body laid in plain view of his
neighbors, family, and community members. 148 Shortly after the death of
Brown, but especially after the nonindictment of the white officer who
shot him, protests erupted in Ferguson.149 Many believed that black
resistance to state-sanctioned physical violence and economic
suppression in the city was long overdue. According to the Department of
Justice\'s 2015 Report on the Ferguson Police Department, the black
population in Ferguson rests at 67 percent, but blacks accounted for 93
percent of arrests, 95 percent of the jailed population, 92 percent of
cases with active warrants in the jurisdiction, and 85 percent of
vehicle stops.\' 50 The Ferguson Police Department has a clear
revenue-generating mandate-each interaction with police results in
fines, fees, and restitution that are dispersed into the city\'s general
fund.\' 51 For 2015, Ferguson anticipated that \$3.09 million of its
projected \$13.26 million budget would come from court fines and fees.
152 In other words, court fines and fees, disproportionately levied
against the black community, comprise nearly 25 percent of the city\'s
revenue. This means that discriminatory policing effectively fuels a
large portion of the City of Ferguson. These were the conditions
protested in Ferguson, and the government responded with a militarized
reaction.153 One photo circulated in the wake of the Ferguson protests
poignantly depicts the militarized police response. In the photo, a
white police officer, dressed in a military uniform and helmet, sits
atop an armored tank that reads \"ST. LOUIS COUNTY POLICE.\' \' 154 The
officer stares down the barrel of a semiautomatic rifle, pointed
directly into a crowd of protestors. One young black protestor, dressed
in a plain white t-shirt, faces the officer, both hands raised above his
head in the \"hands up, don\'t shoot\" stance popularized in the wake of
the Ferguson protests. There are hundreds of photos like this emerging
from Ferguson, depicting the [[military-like control of black
bodies]{.underline}]{.mark}. While deeply troubling, militarized
policing in Ferguson is not an exception. Today, **[[police
departments]{.mark}]{.underline}** in many communities in America
**[[resemble an army]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A. The Reality of Police
Militarization Across the country, [[police departments are
using]{.underline}]{.mark} aggressive [[military
tactics]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and weapons to enforce the
law]{.underline}]{.mark}. In its June 2014 report, \"War Comes Home,\"
the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) documented military weaponry
flooding into local police departments. 155 State and local agencies
have purchased hundreds of lethal weapons, tactical vests, and body
armor at no cost and with virtually no public oversight through the
Department of Defense\'s 1033 Program.156 The ACLU report found a total
of 15,054 items of battle uniforms, or personal protective equipment,
received by sixty-three responding agencies during their investigation
period. 157 Five hundred law enforcement agencies have received Mine
Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles built to withstand
armor-piercing roadside bombs. In 2007, \"the United States spent \$50
billion to produce 27,000 MRAPs and deploy them to Iraq and
Afghanistan.\"\'1 58 Now out of date, or no longer needed in foreign
battlefields, MRAPs have made their way to local police departments
where **[[officers patrol communities like
war-zones]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In addition to the [[proliferation of
military weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} throughout local law enforcement
departments, [[police training also exposes aspiring officers to the
culture of militarism]{.mark}]{.underline} that now permeates the force.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice\'s Bureau of Justice
Statistics Report on State and Local Law Enforcement Training Academies
(BJS Report), the majority of police recruits receive their training in
academies with a stress-based military orientation. 159 Stress-based
military training is designed to prepare young recruits for combat in
war zones by teaching recruits to force the enemy into submission. As
one police trainer put it, \"We trainers have spent the past decade
trying to ingrain in our students the concept that the American police
officer works a battlefield every day he patrols his sector.\"\' 60 This
training does not prepare recruits to win community trust by solving
crimes and protecting constitutional rights. 161 In this logic,
**[[police officers are transformed into soldiers, and black and brown
communities morphed into battlefields]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[[Military]{.underline}]{.mark}-style [[tactics]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[becoming conventional police
strategies]{.underline}]{.mark}. One of the clearest manifestations of
military-style tactics is the rise of SWAT teams. A survey of police
departments across the country reveals that \"the number of SWAT teams
in small towns grew from 20 percent in the 1980s to 80 percent in the
mid-2000s, and that as of the late 1990s, almost 90 percent of larger
cities had them.\"\' 62 It is estimated that \"the number of SWAT raids
per year grew from 3,000 in the 1980s to 45,000 in the mid-2000s.\"\'
163 Contrary to popular belief that SWAT teams are utilized in active
shooter and emergency situations, a report conducted by the University
of Missouri-St. Louis\'s Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice
found that from 1986 to 1998 \"the overwhelming number of SWAT
deployments studied were for the purpose of executing a warrant (34,271
for warrant service, in contrast to 7,384 for a barricaded suspect and
1,180 for hostage-taking cases).\' \' 164 Many of these SWAT teams used
flash-bang grenades, combat helmets, and battle-dress uniforms to serve
search warrants, conduct investigations, and search for drugs. 165 The
proliferation of paramilitary policing has occurred with great speed and
little public oversight. This culture of paramilitarism in policing has
been particularly costly to minority communities and led to unnecessary
loss of life. In Detroit, the killing of a black child, seven-year-old
Aiyana Stanley-Jones, drew national attention. Early one summer morning,
Aiyana slept beside her grandmother when a SWAT team mistakenly raided
her home searching for a suspect in a homicide investigation. One
officer fired at Aiyana, striking her head and killing her.\' 66 Many
were outraged at the senseless murder of an innocent child in what
appeared to be a military raid fueled by a combat mentality. Many also
condemned the excessive use of force that unfairly targeted the black
community in Detroit. This [[disproportionate use of military force
against black and brown communities]{.underline}]{.mark} has been
observed nationwide. The ACLU found that [[the use
of]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[paramilitary weapons and tactics primarily
impacted people of color]{.underline}]{.mark}**, particularly when these
tactics were used to execute drug searches. 167 Ultimately, police were
much more likely to deploy paramilitary tactics to execute a search
warrant if all the participants were people of color (84 percent
deployment rate) than when all the participants were white (65 percent
deployment rate). 1 68 Acknowledging that military policing, and
**[[policing]{.underline}]{.mark}** more broadly, **[[disproportionately
impacts black and brown people]{.underline}]{.mark}**, this Note has
looked beyond the racial impacts of this phenomenon to examine its
racialized roots. Government-sanctioned police militarization is just
part of the story in Ferguson, Baltimore, and countless other cities
across the country. By centering on questions of race, we can begin to
understand what work race does in facilitating police militarization. At
the same time, we may also understand how [[police militarization
constructs race and reinforces racial hierarchies in
America]{.underline}]{.mark}. When analyzing the contemporary state of
police militarization, we must first disassociate police militarization
from actual notions of crime. Some people view increased police
militarization as evidence that police work has become more dangerous.
Proponents of this argument often see increased police armament as a
response to an upsurge in dangerous crime. In fact, since the mid-1990s
the job of police officers has become increasingly safer. It is as safe
today as it has ever been. 69 The number of officer deaths in 1975 more
than halved by 2014, despite many more police officers on the street.\'
70 Rates of violent crime have also reduced significantly since the
mid-century. The year 2013 saw nearly 9,000 fewer homicides, about
27,000 fewer rapes, and about 368,000 fewer aggravated assaults than
1991.71 This reduction occurred when the country\'s population increased
by sixty-four million people. 72 This means that police militarization
has continued without a logical connection to increased risk to police
officers. Rather than a response to increases in violent crime, police
militarization can be viewed as a state-sanctioned form of racemaking.
As the federal government funnels military equipment and training into
local police departments, it enables the presence of tanks on city
streets, networks of surveillance cameras surreptitiously patrolling
entire communities,\' 73 and even assault weapons and grenade launchers
in public schools.1 74 Even if the official police mandate is to protect
and serve all people, the current state of policing is such that [[black
and brown communities are subject to greater surveillance and
control]{.underline}]{.mark}. Unlike poor and minority communities, many
white communities experience policing of a different nature. Rather than
patrol white communities with suspicion, [[police
are]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[dispatched to white communities to
provide]{.underline}]{.mark} security and
[[assistance]{.underline}]{.mark}-this **[[unequal access to security is
a key element of the racial politics of
protection]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Police militarization has the
dual impact of increasing state control of black and brown people while
simultaneously increasing protections for white
people]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Militarized policing creates more
opportunities for the surveillance of black and brown
bodies]{.underline}]{.mark} in the communities where they live, work,
socialize, and attend school. This heightened control is not a result of
the inherent dangerousness of these groups or of any enhanced risk to
police officers that has accumulated over time. Rather, government
programs have made black and brown people vulnerable to militarized
control based on the color of their skin. This is a material
disadvantage of being black or brown-a racial marker. Most importantly,
the images of [[black neighborhoods patrolled by tanks and armored
vehicles]{.underline}]{.mark} in Ferguson and Baltimore clearly
[[demarcate who is outside of state protection]{.underline}]{.mark}. As
in the 1960s, rather than focus on the substantive grievances of
marginalized groups, the State treats these groups as an internal
insurrection. When [[black communities are patrolled with weapons built
to subdue foreign enemies]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[this communicates
something about the citizenship status of black
people]{.underline}]{.mark}-that their status is inferior, that they are
dangerous, and that they are somehow [[outside the American
polity]{.underline}]{.mark}. At the same time, an absence of images
depicting white communities locked down by militarized police conveys
white position within the realm of state protection. White people are
treated as full citizens, worthy of the protections and security that
this status entails. [[Protection is manipulated to signal who enjoys
full citizenship and who will be relegated to second-class
status.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### This apparatus of whiteness is *systematic elimination*- it resists legal restraint and control because the law itself is part of the ammunition loaded into the white weapon- it serves only to reinforce the unequal protection and violence exerted against different groups. Whiteness cannot be restrained to a legal definition because it provides the very framework that laws are carried out by.

#### Whiteness operates through surveillance and spectacle- through both the cameras watching constantly and the brutal killing of black people

**Singh**, Nikhil. Pal. (**2014**). The whiteness of police. American
Quarterly, 66(4), 1091-1099. //LFP

[[Whiteness carries a tremendous price accrued from the debt burdens
assumed by blackness]{.underline}]{.mark} most visibly, as well as other
forms of racialization. But such *valuation is made concrete and
realizable through the work of policing*, [[both the quotidian
surveillance]{.underline}]{.mark} that ensures the maintenance of
racially valorized and devalorized space [[and the exemplary spectacles
by which forms of overt police violence tutor publics in the value of
whiteness as a domain of safety]{.underline}]{.mark} and
self-preservation, regardless of whether they derive pecuniary benefits
from such a relation. Insofar as conscription as much as reward is part
of its formation, there is also a powerfully self-punishing quality
inherent to the order of white supremacy, that is, whiteness must
constantly police itself. In sum and given its broad significance, it is
surprising that the concept of police has not been more central within
scholarly discussions of whiteness and its history. A brief speculative
essay such as this one cannot offer anything approaching a full
accounting of how the racialized economy and government of the United
States shaped the development of modern police powers, domestically and
internationally, how police powers developed in and through racial
differentiation, and how conceptions of race and expansions of criminal
jurisdiction over previously noncriminal domains (i.e., criminalization)
have been braided together in mutually supportive ways. What I have
tried to do is to suggest some starting points for such an inquiry, as
it is one that may hold some of the keys to comprehending the
conservation of racisms in the face of the emergence of antiracist and
postracist doxa in the contemporary period. For once this problematic is
made central, the long-standing proximity of the racial and the criminal
becomes ubiquitous. It is perhaps facile to equate "the beat" that
marked out the geography of the slave patrol with the modern patrolman's
beat. Still, former New York City police commissioner Raymond Kelley (at
one time a candidate for director of Homeland Security) defended the
racially disproportionate policy of stop and frisk on the grounds that
it "instills fear" in the city's criminal element. Encouraged by a
"statistics based performance management system," the NYPD has conducted
a staggering 4 million stops and some 2.3 million frisks since 2004.
More than 81 percent of these targeted the city's black and Latino
residents. Only 1.5 percent of these police actions resulted in the
discovery of a weapon and only 6 percent of all stops resulted in
arrest. Judge Shira A. Sheindlin, who ruled against the city's defense
of this policy (before being removed from the case herself), notes that
"the racial composition of the precinct or census tract predicts the
stop rate above and beyond the crime rate" and that the population
stopped and frisked is "overwhelmingly innocent."18 Policing what comes
to be denoted as crime---from mild correction to justifiable
homicide---was the essence of slave and frontier law. The long arc of
criminalizing blackness in particular helps us to recognize racial
distinction as the obscured mode of institution of society that has been
retained across changes in formal racial categories and degrees of
inclusion. [[If white supremacy is understood as a form of
group-differentiated power]{.underline}]{.mark} and pleasure that
accrues value, [[the racial distribution and directionality of the
legitimate violence it exerts over those regarded as "dangerous and
inconvenient" publicly confirms]{.underline}]{.mark} it and performs its
most essential work. "The majority of Negroes are of a plotting
disposition, dark, sullen, malicious, revengeful, and cruel in the
highest degree," Benjamin Franklin notes toward the end of his life,
this time without qualification. Despite his growing abolitionist
sympathies, Franklin doubted that "mild laws could govern such a
people," which is to say that he affirmed the whiteness of police.19 The
routine police murder of black men and women from Amadou Diallo to
Renisha McBride and Michael Brown in our own time demonstrates its
continuous legacy. When President Barack Obama's attorney general Eric
Holder recently defended juridically indefensible [[targeted killing by
drone]{.underline}]{.mark}---a practice whose collateral victims include
those engaging in forms of feasting and funerary sociality---by likening
it to [[the exigencies of the police who not unreasonably "prevent
escape by using deadly force,"]{.underline}]{.mark} he once again
extends its sway to the ends of the earth.20

#### Policing is drone warfare targeted at populations targeted for elimination in a form of necropolitical calculus that is designed around inequality- there is no reform, the entire project is designed to police black people and eliminate them as threats to whiteness with impunity.

The problems with this should be clear to anyone who has given any
thought to the ways **[[racialized and classed targeting has been and
continues to be fundamen- tal to US police power]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Or to anyone who has been paying attention to the thou- sands of police
killings of poor people across the US, disproportionately Black and
Brown men and women. The understanding of police as somehow accountable
to law that is primarily bound to a"rights bearing",
albeit"guilty"individual does not hold up well under the racial history
of police in the United States, from Jim Crow policing to mass
incarceration and police killings today. As Naomi Murakawa has argued,
even when"law and order"is"working normally"the result is nothing short
of racial order, since [[at every stage of the contemporary criminal
justice system classed and racialized inequalities
abound]{.underline}]{.mark} via criminal law, including along the lines
of routine police stops, arrests, and other forms of violence (see
Alexander 2012). It should go without saying that the over two million
people in- carcerated in prisons or the nearly 12 million cycling
through jails each year, or the approximately 10--12 million people
arrested each year, are all disproportio- nately Black and Brown and
overwhelmingly poor. Furthermore, these views mis- read the police power
in fundamental ways,first by conflating"law enforcement" with"police",
and by extension repeating the liberal mantra that"police"is con- cerned
with justice, rights, and guilt. In opposition to this liberal
smokescreen, [[police is best understood as]{.underline}]{.mark}
concerned less with"enforcing law"and"fighting crime", and more with the
question of [[how to fabricate an unequal propertied order
through]{.underline}]{.mark} identifying and [[eradicating threats
to]{.underline}]{.mark} this [[order]{.underline}]{.mark} (see Dubber
2005; Neocleous 2000; Singh 2014; Wagner 2010). As Blomley (2012:917)
states,"police operates in a different register"than a rights framework,
so we have to be careful not to reduce police to other governmental
logics and instead unpack police in their own terms. From [[the police
perspective]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[what matters is]{.underline}]{.mark}
not"guilt"or"justice"or even"rights", but **[[the mandate of responding
to all levels of"emergencies"in order to eliminate always classed and
racialized threats with various degrees of
violence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Much of the concern
over"exceptional"drone violence is that drones usher in unprecedented
ways of sovereign death-dealing---a"unilateral delivery of death" (see
Shaw 2015)---and in turn eliminating the shared risk of mortality that
struc- tured traditional warfare. [[The lethal
surveillance]{.underline}]{.mark} of drones has emerged as a quin-
tessential example of the necropolitical, or a"racial algorithm of
distinction"that involves"the **[[identification of populations as less
than life, or as dangerous life whose extinguishing must be managed in
order for valuable life to flourish]{.underline}]{.mark}**" (Allinson
2015:117). In her discussion of"drone necropolitics", Allinson argues
that the"drone's eye view is a fundamentally biopolitical one"in that
the drone"surveys and audits"the"patterns of life"of those below. But as
she goes on,"the drone is not an instrument of making life live among
those it surveys. [[Its purpose is to destroy
bodies]{.underline}]{.mark}" and therefore the drone must be understood
as"a technology of racial distinction"(2015:120) that only exists within
the necropolitical that demarcates between"populations worthy and
unworthy of life". According to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism
(https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/), as of February 2014 nearly
2500 people were killed by drones. Similarly, as of November 2014, 1147
civilians have been killed by drones in Pakistan and Yemen, deaths that
took place during the drone targeting of 41"known targets", according to
Reprieve (http://www.reprieve.org.uk/). Drones are most definitely
necropolitical, and it is fair to say these sociotechnical systems do in
fact offer the security state powerful means of lethal surveillance. But
even if we accept the ways that drone violence is a non-reciprocal mode
of death-dealing with"no gradation of its use of force"(Chamayou
2015:169), the fact remains thatat least in the United States [[the
police have long operated as a"unilateral delivery of
death"and"technology of racial distinction]{.underline}]{.mark}", with
officers"eradi- cating threats"while themselves rarely getting killed
(relatively speaking the police profession is a safe occupation).
Necropolitics is most often located in the animus of colonial and
industrial warfare (see Mbembe 2003), but what should not be forgot- ten
is that at least **[[in the US, police power has long been
necropolitical]{.underline}]{.mark}**, even if li- beral ideology often
works to mask this fact. Keeping in mind the drone death statistics
mentioned above, consider for instance the most recent mortality
statistics on police killings in the US. Data from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics show that an average of 928 people were killed by the police
each year from 2003 to 2009, meaning that nearly a total of 6500 people
were killed. According to a database maintained byThe Guardian, in 2015,
1138 people were killed by US police. 1 When broken down
demographically,"non-white"people were more likely to be killed compared
with their respective group demographics within the national popula-
tion, with 302 victims listed as Black, 194 Hispanic/Latino, 27 listed
as"other/un- known", 24 Asian/Pacific Islander, and 13 Native American,
while 578 were white (it is safe to say that the white victims were
mostly poor). AsMapping Police
Violence(http://mappingpoliceviolence.org/) reports, 71% of Black people
killed by police in 2014 were considered"non-violent", with only 29%
said to be armed with a gun. In addition, they report that 97% of the
police killings in 2015 resulted in officersnotbeing charged with a
crime, confirming Jared Sexton's (2007:198) argument that"the police
operate astheunaccountable arbiters of lethal violence". The mortality
statistics of drone violence and police killings starkly suggest an
unnerving parallel between these different modes of death-dealing as
well as an in- version of what might be a commonsense: the "legal" and
ostensibly "accountable" violence of police produces more corpses than
the "spectacular" and "extrajudicial" necropolitics of the drone.
Locating targeted drone killings on a continuum with police killings
helps to highlight the ways the killing state works to make illegible
its own violence, and this is partly executed by the state refusing to
partake in any systematic counting of its produced fatalities. For
instance, like the drone program, [[police killings have been shrouded
in secrecy]{.underline}]{.mark} with no clear num- bers as to how many
have been killed and wounded---there is no law that requires police
count how many people they kill each year nor is there a government
data- base, with only non-governmental efforts recently developing with
websites like The Guardian's or the similarMapping Police Violence.
These sites are not unlike websites such asIraq Body
Count(https://www.iraqbodycount.org/) that were created to counter the
refusal to count civilian war deaths (i.e. Rumsfeld's infamous "We don't
do body counts"). I am certainly not suggesting one form of state
killing is more politically appalling (both are), rather my point is to
bring them together by way of suggesting that **[[the apparent
exceptionality of death by drone abroad has its structural, legal
corollary in the normal, routine procedures animating domestic police
violence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although often taken for granted, it is
important to note that [[the"terrorist threat" to which drones are said
to respond are often discussed in specifically police
terms.]{.underline}]{.mark} Consider for instance the insidious
circulation of a particular phrase within the war on terror and the
drone war specifically: terroristsuspect. Although there has been much
debate and unpacking of terms like"enemy combatant","unlawful comba-
tant" , and even"terrorist", and discussion on how
the"enemy"and"criminal"have recentlyblurred in the terror war, the most
normalized of concepts operative to the drone wars is the suspected
terrorist or [[the terrorist suspect]{.underline}]{.mark}. But of course
it should go without saying that the suspect [[is first and foremost a
police subject]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is to say [[a
threat]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Bryan Wagner (2010) demonstrates, [[the
"threat scenario" structures all police power]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
this is to say that [[when the liberal state speaks in the language of
threat, it is speaking in the language of]{.underline}]{.mark} not only
war, but equally of [[police]{.underline}]{.mark}. The ghostly figure of
the police suspect, always marked as racialized threat, tips us off to
the ways that police power animates the drone wars specifically and the
terror war more generally. If the very notion of suspicion implies
hierarchical power relations, the aerial drone offers the security state
the potential of perfecting the police project of placing entire
populations" under suspicion" while police remain" above suspicion".
There has been much made of the ways that "asymmetrical warfare "to
which drones belong is characterized by an inability to distinguish
between friends and enemies, civilians and threats---but in many ways
[[this problem of "indistinction" runs through the whole police
problematic]{.underline}]{.mark}. That is, [[police operate in a
political geography characterized by cops never
knowing]{.underline}]{.mark}, and always trying to "find out", [[who is
a threat]{.underline}]{.mark} and who is not, who is suspicious and who
is not, who is an enemy and who is not. We might take from this that the
problem of "[[indistinction]{.underline}]{.mark}" animating late modern
war, frequently said to be a relatively new historical phenomenon, [[is
nothing other than the extension of the coercive encounter between
policer and policed that has always been endemic to the police
project]{.underline}]{.mark}. Relatedly, many have pointed out the
importance of logics of prevention and preemption that structure the
security state's justification of drone violence and other security
measures. But it is worth pointing out that [[the logic of prevention
and preemption was histori- cally built into the police
concept]{.underline}]{.mark}---the "preventative police"(see Neocleous
2000)---suggesting how"preemptive"drone strikes might usefully be
conceived asfirst and foremost structured by a fundamental police
principle.

#### Whiteness seeks to impose everyone as drones in an assemblage that reconstructs the world as whiteness- policing and other weapons of verticality project whiteness and increase the ability of whiteness to further weaponize itself against communities that are necropolitically demarcated

I started out from the deployment of an artisanally confected land-based
killer policing drone in the hope that the facts of that unprecedented
incident in Dallas would, in the shifts of emphasis they effected,
enable a probing discussion of drone theory, in particular that of
Chamayou. I also wanted to use the incident to speculate in an informed
way about the future of weaponized drones as techniques of domestic
policing. I proceeded by working through three broadly delineated areas
of scepticism about drone theory as it intersects with policing and
shall present a synthesis of these findings before responding briefly to
Arthur Bradley's (2019) article in this issue. [[Today's military drones
are not unprecedented technologies]{.underline}]{.mark}, but nor can
their singularity be completely subsumed within the history of their
antecedents; moreover, **[[the 'politics of verticality' essential to
their psychotechnical projection of power is likely to be tempered in
tomorrow's swarming horizontal police drones]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
**[[Discussions of the future of policing drones that construe them as
symptoms of police militarization]{.underline}]{.mark}** operate, as
Neocleous and Wall have demonstrated, [[with a historically and
conceptually inadequate understanding of policing]{.underline}]{.mark},
even if the idea of police militarization remains politically
meaningful. Sceptics of drone theory have suggested that describing
drones as extrusions of the bureaucratic apparatus is not sufficient to
distinguish them from marines or other disciplined servants of order.
While I concede that police, marines and drones can certainly all be
construed as extrusions of this sort, the contemporary police order of
bureaucracy I have called '**[[governance' seeks to enlist all subjects
as its drones]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The ongoing expansion of [[this
order incites subjects to identify with administering
power]{.underline}]{.mark} and, at the maximal synecdochic reach of
critical drone theory, [[this is what the universalizing ambition of the
policing drone implies]{.underline}]{.mark}: the [[saturation of mental,
physical and metaphysical space]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[objects and
subjects, buildings and ideas, with human--machinic assemblages that
continually view and reconstruct the world from the perspective of
governance]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Does this mean the policing drone has
become too general to define? I suggest not. The policing drone, be it
mainly human, mainly machinic, or a composite assemblage, effects the
cynegetic 'snap-to-grid' function of governance: the policing drone
detects and moves towards the anomalous and the suspicious, as a
hunter-shepherd, seeking to bring it back within the flexible lines of
governance's nevertheless all too controlling modular grid. One
prominent defender of US drone killings abroad, Amitai Etzioni, suggests
how the policing drone will function as a synecdoche for neoliberal
governance: he argues that collateral damage could be reduced by
'enabling the general population to leave an area before an attack'
(Etzioni, 2010: 69). This implies that when confronted by possibilistic
algorithmic profiling that establishes dividual connections of
association and uses them to mark out individuals for preventative
extrajudicial killing, it will now be the duty of the targeted to
display their own dissociation from suspect elements, to actively
exhibit their self-distancing from designated risks or face the
possibility of annihilation as part of a generalized duty of showy
self-entrepreneurship. This is the strong form that normalization takes
in neoliberalism's police order of governance. Arthur Bradley, in his
article in this issue, develops the Hobbesian strand of Chamayou's drone
theory to such an extent that what appears to be a repatriation of
killer drones seems no more, or less, than the radical realization of
one of the possibilities inherent in the relationship between subject
and sovereign: subjects pre-authorize automated acts of self-killing
directed against them. However exactly we understand such a repatriation
(or, as it appears in Bradley's account, a radicalization of already
inherent possibilites), I would suggest that the scope for resistance
lies in continually exposing the entirely fictive though technically
efficacious quality of the act of authorization as Hobbes and his
followers envisage it, for example by cultivating first an innner
secession from such manipulative storytelling followed by an outer
secession that secures, alone or with a swarm of like-minded others,
zones of refuge against the sovereign's weaponized policing
technologies, whether permanently or in temporary fields of mobile
insurrection.

#### We affirm infiltration as an exercise in working within the cracks in the system- creating radical hope within the breaks in social order via pedagogies of sabotage- turn the machines of the social order against themselves in forms of resistance that operate within dominant paradigms

Infiltration: a word that may evoke a host of thoughts and fantasies
from soldiers operating behind enemy lines, police informants gaining
access to criminal organizations, or to scenarios of radicals inserting
themselves into corporations or research labs. Whatever the scenario,
[[infiltration can be a tactic that anarchists pursue
when]{.underline}]{.mark} thinking about [[operating within current
institutional realities]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially if interested
in teaching in public schools. Although this claim is entangled within
complex relationships of power and privilege, [[struggle arises wherever
domination coalesces]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially [[within
institutional structures and settings]{.underline}]{.mark} (Sharp,
Routledge, Philo & Paddison, 2000). Power conjures, "the threadings,
knottings and weavings" of social relationships through a intertwining
of the social, political, moral, educational, and historical realities
of a given society. In this way, power is "crucially and unavoidably
spun out across and through the material spaces of the world" (Sharp, et
al., 2000, p. 22). This chapter thus looks to situate itself and [[build
radical pedagogy within the threads and knots of contemporary
relationships of power]{.underline}]{.mark}; [[in
between]{.underline}]{.mark} what Holloway (2010) has called [[the
"cracks" of capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}, trying to "desperately find
. . . faults beneath the surface, or to create cracks by banging the
walls" (p. 8). [[Cracks have emerged through]{.underline}]{.mark}
environmental [[disaster]{.underline}]{.mark}, economic
[[collapse]{.underline}]{.mark}, psychological
[[alienation]{.underline}]{.mark}, a [[crisis]{.mark} [of identity, and
decades of]{.mark}]{.underline} war and [[imperial
aggression]{.underline}]{.mark} conducted by the West. It is under these
historical conditions that resistance needs to be conceptualized.
[[Creating, finding and exploiting "cracks"]{.underline}]{.mark} within
a diffused and networked capitalism demonstrates that [[dated narratives
of revolutionary struggle are no longer viable]{.underline}]{.mark} and
there is "no guarantee of a happy ending" (Holloway, 2010, p. 9).
Unfortunately, although these narratives may provide comfort amid an
onslaught of capitalism, war, death, terror, and alienation, they do not
open up, nor allow, alternative possibilities of resistance to form
outside the boundaries they construct. In some ways, these may only help
to reproduce the current order we find ourselves in. This does not mean
that we should resign ourselves to the throngs of nihilistic defeat, as
[[there is]{.underline}]{.mark} indeed [[potential for radical hope
within the cracks of Empire]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The
multitude]{.underline}]{.mark}, with its potential for infinite
possibilities, [[can build a complex]{.underline}]{.mark} and dispersed
[[resistance through the breaks,]{.underline}]{.mark} tears, [[and folds
of our social order]{.underline}]{.mark} (Deleuze, 1992), [[and the
tactics and pedagogies that we envision as radicals can attempt to
capture this spirit]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although the manifestations of
these cracks and folds is yet to be seen, I leave the reader to their
own radical imaginations in [[devising ways to subvert a networked and
diffused machine]{.mark}]{.underline} (Shukaitis, 2009). Evoking the
metaphor of a "machine," as I describe the multifaceted nature of
contemporary capitalism, harkens to Trotter's (1990) claim that
colonialism operated in a very similar way, divorced from individual
interactions and operating abstractly through "official" and
"unofficial" discourses, forms of knowledge, ways of knowing, the
morality of a given era, and the reproduction of knowledge to name a
few. The analogy of a machine also challenges that human agency is
solely at the center of how social system operate, because [[machines,
"create, distribute, and organize populations and impose regimes of
conduct, agency and effectivity" outside of individual actors and
agency]{.underline}]{.mark} (Grossberg, 2010, p. 36). Radicals (within
and outside the labor movement) had ingenious ways in which to deal with
the machines of capitalism, occurring through tactics that spanned
strikes, sit-ins, walking out, and subversion to even more direct forms
like sabotaging machinery, bringing production to a halt. [[Sabotage is
a tactic that anarchists need to rethink]{.underline}]{.mark} [[in light
of]{.underline}]{.mark} how labor is now dispersed among a wide variety
of institutional realities (factories, banks, corporations, and public
institutions, for example), as well as the [[contemporary knowledge and
abstract economies.]{.underline}]{.mark} The machines of capitalism that
produced goods during the height of the Industrial Revolution of the
nineteenth century provide us a way in which to think of societal
machines and tactics that can be adapted for current conditions. [[How
do]{.underline}]{.mark} we as [[anarchists]{.underline}]{.mark}, who
want to teach and work with students, [[deal with the contradictions of
being located within the same institutions that seek to discipline
bodies]{.underline}]{.mark} and coerce us? How do [[we sabotage these
machines and build a radical pedagogy]{.underline}]{.mark} from this
perspective? [[Sabotage provides a provocative conceptual framework in
which to think about building alternative forms of resistance and aligns
with ways in which anarchists have historically conceptualized direct
political action]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is even more interesting
when we think of how this will emerge [[through educational
practice]{.underline}]{.mark}, as teaching [[allows us to directly
engage ideology, challenging students' conceptions about the world
around them]{.underline}]{.mark}. With this type of important, dare I
say political work, why do some anarchists shun the world of public
teaching and service? Education is at the "front lines" of the
contemporary ideological war conducted by corporate media, official
organs of the State, and influential economic institutions. Whether that
emerges through corporate textbooks that omit subaltern experiences and
worldviews, standardized testing that stress rote memorization, or a
curriculum that reproduces Eurocentrism and Western ways of knowing,
education is invested in reproducing dominant conceptions of the world.
However, sabotage can take myriad forms, and this chapter will build on
the conceptual idea of building politics of infiltration.

#### The resolution is another form of whiteness -- the imposition that arms can only be FMS or DCS is whiteness restricting critical thought in order to sustain itself -- radical concepts like race aren't allowed within the resolution because that's a challenge to whiteness. We seek to intervene into that discour3se, into that application of whiteness. We are already students at debate camp, we have already been accepted into the debate community, we have already been on the inside of the debate space and thus the resolution -- that was the infiltration. Thus, the 1ac is an act of *sabotage* -- it challenges the notion that arms can only be what whiteness dictates them to be. Instead we claim that whiteness is the largest arm within the topic. 

#### Anarchist infiltration has been a tool that white people have used to resist antiblack violence-The Citizen's Commission to Investigate the FBI broke in and leaked COINTELPRO to black activists and exposed the surveillance the FBI carried out. The Weather Underground carried out bombings on facilities of US Imperialism, like the capitol, the Pentagon, and the 103^rd^ police precinct in New York as revenge for atrocities committed by armed forces. These actions are erased from the archives of history to reinforce whiteness as governance over black and brown communities, to pacify white people.

#### Anarchist infiltration disrupts dominant forms of organization and learning- performing the role of the subversive revolutionary within policed spaces enables the deconstruction of those forms and the possibility of new ones.

It is widely accepted that State agents have infiltrated radical social
movements historically (Fernandez, 2008). Whether through direct
insertion into radical groups or sophisticated crowd surveillance, the
State is invested in destroying and subverting social movements that
question State authority or the institutions of capitalism. State agents
appear to have a tremendous amount of authority and autonomy in these
operations and are able to take direct action against any individual or
group deemed a threat. The political and social backdrop in the wake of
September 11 has granted State agents and authorities even more direct
control (Parenti, 2007). Radical, progressive, and liberal political
groups throughout the United States have endured wiretaps, police raids,
and State surveillance aimed at arrest, incarceration, or serving as
informants (Borum & Tilby, 2004). Through these types of operations, the
State attempts to envelop, discredits, or destroy social and political
movements from within (Fernandez, 2008). If this is indeed the reality
in which the State operates through the police and other agencies,
radical and progressive traditions of marches, sit-ins, boycotts, and
other vestiges from our protest past seem wholly inadequate. Combine
this with the diffused nature of contemporary capitalist arrangements
and how it spans the milieu of social experiences, it becomes an even
greater challenge to resist. However, we know this. We have historical
evidence in which to study how other past actions have been done. There
is potential evidence that exists from participants and survivors who
have witnessed or experienced these State interventions that needs
qualitative work to explore these stories further. The initial seeds in
which to build from already exist for us to grow. Using an analogy from
nature (specifically "growth") highlights my own commitment in imagining
potentials that are organic in nature and reimagining traditional
coercive relationships. [[Hierarchical
arrangements]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [[ordering of
life]{.underline}]{.mark}, spatial and architectural arrangements, [[and
the privileging of positivist discourses and ways of
knowing]{.underline}]{.mark} are by-products of Enlightenment philosophy
and European colonial projects (Legg, 2007). Although these have shaped
the West in fundamental ways, [[resistance has to move beyond positivist
ways of knowing and thinking about current social, political, and
economic realities]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark}
also **[[means dispersing ourselves throughout a variety of social
locations through insertion and infiltration]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
disguising oneself for the current task at hand. As CrimethInc. (2006)
provocatively asks the reader, "Do you find yourself wishing that [[a
passerby]{.underline}]{.mark} would take [[advantage of his
squeaky-clean look to do some dastardly revolutionary
deed]{.underline}]{.mark}?" (p. 306). CrimethInc. has provided an
interesting way to think about direct action, especially since they urge
us to [[become "that squeaky-clean passerby]{.underline}]{.mark} . . .
\[[[that]{.underline}]{.mark}\] . . . [[acts certain ways so they can
move through a repressive social environment without arousing
suspicion]{.underline}]{.mark}" (p. 306). Because they claim that
[[everyone is acting]{.underline}]{.mark} and playing [[their social
role]{.underline}]{.mark} anyways, we are all "experts on acting" (p.
306) which is [[a key component to infiltration]{.underline}]{.mark}:
[[playing a part]{.mark}]{.underline} that might not necessarily be one
that an activist would normally personally adopt, but **[[helps to
"gather intelligence, spread disinformation \[and\] create
disruption]{.underline}]{.mark}**" (p. 306). The official role of
"teacher" requires us to assume certain subjectivities and a willingness
to play institutional roles deemed "true" and "acceptable." This is
especially relevant for those of us who have radical politics and find
the operations of schools at all levels in the United States to be
particularly disturbing and repugnant. But being a teacher seems to
encompass a performative spirit, as the classroom and the identity of
teacher becomes a role in which to play out lived and embodied
ideologies. Thinking of teaching as performance makes the classroom an
exciting and invigorating space for learning, but, this performative
reality of identity escapes school walls through our circumstances and
those identities assumed by us through personal experiences, the media,
and other forms of representation. Pelias (2008) discusses the
performative role of identity, especially when it comes to gender or
other socially sanctioned identities assumed valid and real. I have been
called forth, called to the theatrical and cultural stage, called to
move my performing body as an ideological and disciplined subject. This
interpolation turns my body into a site that is worked upon and into a
source for understanding. I maneuver and am maneuvered among the scripts
I encounter, sometimes consenting, sometimes resisting, but never
escaping the apparatus of it all. I am caught, tethered to the system of
my own and others' making. I am an actor performing life. (p. 65) The
idea of performance and what this means for praxis and research is a
provocative way in which to think how we assume our various identities
because as Pelias aptly points out, [[resistance is]{.underline}]{.mark}
also [[a vital component to the performances of everyday
life]{.underline}]{.mark}. Performance and performative methodologies, a
burgeoning interest in autoethnography and critical qualitative
research, demonstrates the importance of the body in interpreting and
constructing what is considered "reality" (Markula, 2008; St. Pierre,
2008). Bodies lie at the heart of the experiential nature of human life
and society, because we need to, "bring the body out from the shadow of
the mind" (Hardt, 1993, p. 107) to better understand the role(s) of
bodies in radical and revolutionary movements and insurgencies. [[Bodies
can]{.underline}]{.mark} playfully [[resist or infiltrate historically
oppressive institutions to sabotage from within]{.underline}]{.mark}: a
fragmented and postmodern insurgency. "[[Insurgencies are the incubators
of new ideas and knowledges]{.underline}]{.mark}; places where hopes and
energies that there could exist other forms of social arrangements
different from that what exists today, that there are alternatives, are
cultivated" (Shukaitis, 2009, p. 63). What this entails though is an
understanding of the importance that performance plays in the formation
of our identities, but also in how we interact with others across a
range of social spheres. [[Performance thus becomes a site of
resistance]{.underline}]{.mark} that demonstrates how politics, culture,
ideology, power, governmentality, and knowledge intersect through the
bodies of historical actors (Denzin, 2003). [[Anarchism addresses issues
of identity and embodiment and thus is invested with the
body]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[in terms of issues like race, class, or how
sexuality has been constructed]{.underline}]{.mark} (discursively,
ideologically, politically, economically, etc.) in the West (Heckert,
2005). Because anarchism has explored identity and its role in radical
political struggles, anarchism provides a history of thinking about what
identity means in contemporary society, stressing its socially
constructed nature and the performative role it plays in building our
inner self. CrimethInc. urges us to "spend time learning your character"
(p. 308), but what does this mean within the context of education and
specifically, becoming-teacher? Traditionally, teacher is associated
with a specific way of being. Educational theories abound that tell us
that behavior (usually collected under "behaviorism") of students should
be the locus of educational practice and a majority of educational
thought has been traditionally grouped under this mantra: punishment for
rules infraction, assigning grades for work that meets specific
criteria, strict demarcation of time and space, and the closed system of
knowledge that "official" school curricula reproduce (Apple, 2000).

#### We, as white people, are turning the weapons of whiteness against ourselves. Structures of white supremacy, like the government, reassert themselves as a precondition to addressing racialized violence in the status quo. The United States federal government is among the many perpetrators of antiblack violence. Similarly, the call of the resolution to invest ourselves into this institutions as complicit in the cycle, to talk about a definition of arms sales that undercuts discussions of weaponry writ large in favor of a limited understanding of dcs and fms, as a form of governing what discussions aren't dangerous to whiteness within rounds. 

# INFRAPOLITICS

#### In the remote landscape of Congo, one of the most rich mineral deposits on earth, children and adults alike dive into the hundred foot deep mines to obtain one of the most sought after materials in the global economy: cobalt. Cobalt is used in the rechargeable lithium ion batteries that companies such as Apple use to power iPhones and computers. The world's ever increasing demand for cobalt is all too frequently met by the workers in exploited and debilitated countries, including children, who labor in harsh and dangerous conditions. Cobalt miners in Congo use hand tools like shovels to dig hundreds of feet underground with extremely little oversight and all too few safety measures. Deaths and injuries are understandably common. The mining activity exposes local communities to levels of toxic metals that are linked to ailments that include breathing problems and birth defects. No one monitors the supply chains. No one wonders how their phone is made, or how its materials were sourced. We don't. We don't worry about how the products we use in our daily life come from the exportation of whiteness. We don't concern ourselves with the fact that we continually sell the desirability of white able-bodiedness to the periphery. We don't care that we use the sale of whiteness to justify viewing the periphery as less desirable in a cycle of control that we use to profit from that exploitation. We don't care that the products we use are the profits of systemic violence, or that we render the periphery maimable. Our very existence is inextricably tied to the cycle of violence that is a direct result of the sale of whiteness.

I had an interesting conversation with TJ last night about a very
challenging post on his site titled, bluntly, "[[There are no 'good
white people]{.underline}]{.mark}.'" TJ is wrestling here with how [[the
American]{.mark} (and European) [concept of "whiteness" and the national
environment of white-supremacy distorts all of us]{.mark}]{.underline}
(white people and PoC) [[as individuals]{.mark} and pollutes the
relationships we have with one another]{.underline}. He concisely brings
out the real, devastating and (for the foreseeable future) inescapable
consequences of the fiction of race--the social reality of the invented
category--and he points out the privileged asymmetry through which
people marked as white can pretend to escape white-supremacy (this is
the other side of the burden of knowledge that Baldwin and Coates
elegantly describe). I encourage you to read TJ's post in its entirety,
but I will quote the opening here: Sometimes I wonder if white people
know what a constant state of grace and forbearance they get from people
of color every day. I think so many white folk like to imagine that
they're the "good ones," that they don't do fucked up or racist things,
and that they're not bad and wouldn't seek to marginalize or hurt POC
ever. But honestly, we live in a society where things are tilted for you
every damn day. At any point, any of you can turn on us. Lovers,
friends, family, colleagues. Any of you. [As TJ and I discussed
yesterday, this is,]{.underline} in some ways, [a statement of our
general human condition]{.underline}: goodness isn't a location you can
arrive at or an object you can come to possess. Goodness is an active
principle, and you are only ever as good as your present actions. Hannah
Arendt describes human qualities like goodness, courage, etc. as
"virtues" in Machiavelli's sense of virtue: goodness (etc.) is an action
performed among other human beings, and you are only good when you are
giving a virtuosic performance. Jay Smooth puts it more simply: being
good (being anti-racist, for instance) is like brushing your teeth; you
have to do it every day. Going back to TJ's terminology, [[there are no
good white people because you have to perform your role as an ally every
day]{.mark}. [You never arrive at the point where you don't have to
think about it or where you can be a little bit racist because you
earned your "good white person" badge]{.mark}]{.underline}. The reality
of that continuous responsibility comes through with painful clarity in
TJ's point that "[[At any point, any of you can turn]{.underline}
on]{.mark} us." If you think being constantly on your toes as a white
ally sounds demanding, [imagine being [a person of color who can be
betrayed by allies and intimates at any moment]{.mark}.]{.underline} If
white allies live under a constant moral imperative, people of color
live under a constant threat of injury that could arrive without warning
from any direction. **[[White supremacy is racial
terrorism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, even in its most genteel forms; [[it
shapes lives through the threat of violence]{.mark}, even when things
appear calm.]{.underline} [[As white allies, we have to recognize that
**whiteness is a weapon.** We are born with this weapon, we cannot put
it down, and we injure people with it]{.mark}]{.underline} when we
forget it is in our hands. [[The]{.mark} national (and [international)
structures of white supremacy gave us these weapons to use for our own
benefit]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It designed the weapon of whiteness
to]{.underline} hobble people of color and [give us an advantage over
them in life.]{.underline} [[**It designed its weapon to** exploit,
control and **destroy black bodies for the benefit of white
people**]{.underline}.]{.mark} We can renounce those designs and live
our lives against the grain of white supremacy, but--and this is a
tragedy for everyone involved--[as long as we live within an environment
structured by white supremacy, we cannot put the weapon
down.]{.underline} We cannot puwt it down because we are the weapon[:
[the structure of white supremacy engraves whiteness into our bodies,
and we cannot escape our bodies.]{.underline} [We live within/as the
weapon of whiteness]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} We do not have
to use our whiteness to attack others, but, even when we do not use it
to intentionally, whiteness threatens to wound those around us the
moment we get careless. Worse than that, [the weapon of whiteness is a
threat even when we are mindful and careful and
conscientious]{.underline}. It is a threat because, as TJ points out,
any one of us can turn on our friends, family, lovers, etc. at any
moment, even if we don't mean to do it. [No degree of enlightenment or
number of good deeds will sheath the blade of our whiteness or make it
incapable of injuring others.]{.underline} Because we carry and will
always carry this destructive weapon with us, we must dedicate ourselves
to mindfulness, to care, and to gratitude for the grace and forbearance
we receive from the PoC who stay with us knowing that we will hurt them.
(As TJ and I discussed last night, a similar structure also applies to
relationships between men and women in partriarchal environments, to
cis-gendered people in transphobic environments, etc.)

#### The United States, and all connected monopolies over the global neoliberal supply chain, place dangerous materials and factories in third world countries at the expense of the populations---generates inevitable debilitation. Distinct from disability, debilitation is the direct result of laboring and viewed as a necessary or expected consequence. Debility as a result of the sale of whiteness by racial capitalism is ignored, and is rather used as a biopolitical method of control against maimable populations.

In her work on bodily impaired miners in Botswana who do not necessarily
articulate their plight in relation to disability, [Julie Livingston
uses **[the term "debility," defined]{.mark} broadly to [encompass
"experiences of chronic illness]{.mark} and senescence, [as well as
disability per se.]{.mark}"**8 She demonstrates that]{.underline}
[historically many bodily infirmities "were not regarded as
disabilities: indeed they were 'normal' and in some cases even expected
impairments."9]{.underline} I take up Livingston's intervention with an
important refinement: debility in my usage is not meant to encompass
disability. Rather, [I mobilize debility as a connective tissue to
illuminate the possibilities and limits of disability imaginaries and
economies. **[Debilitation as a normal consequence of laboring, as an
"expected impairment," is not a flattening of disability;]{.mark}
rather, [this framing exposes the violence of what constitutes "a normal
consequence."]{.mark} The category of disability is instrumentalized by
state discourses of inclusion not only to obscure forms of debility but
also to actually produce debility and sustain its
proliferation**.]{.underline} In a literal sense, caretakers of people
with disabilities often come from chronically disenfranchised
populations that endure debilities themselves. **[[Conceptually,
state,]{.mark} medical, and other forms of recognition of disability
[may shroud debilities and forms of slow death while also effacing the
quotidian modalities of widescale debilitation]{.mark} so prevalent [due
to capitalist exploitation and imperialist
expansion]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In my usage, [debility signals
precisely the temporospatial frame eclipsed by toggling between
exceptionalizing disability and exceptional disability: the endemic**.
[Relational forms of capitalism]{.mark}, care, [and racialization inform
an assemblage of disability to a constellation of debilities]{.mark} and
capacities. If, in one definition, disability becomes a privileged
category by virtue of state recognition, another definition of
disability may well be that body or that subject that can aspire both
economically and emotionally to wellness, empowerment, and pride through
the exceptionalized status it accrues while embedded within
unexceptional and, in fact endemic, debility.**]{.underline} The
compounding of disability and poverty as a field of debilitation is
certainly happening in the era of Donald Trump, whose efforts to
completely eliminate any whiff of socialized medicine are only really
remarkable because they definitively expose the actual scale of
disregard for human life, having blown so far open so quickly. Access to
health care may well become the defining factor in one's relationship to
the non-disabled/ disabled dichotomy. [Debility is thus a crucial
complication of the neoliberal transit of disability
rights.]{.underline} **[[Debility addresses injury and bodily exclusion
that are endemic rather than epidemic or exceptional, and reflects a
need for rethinking overarching structures of working, schooling, and
living rather than relying on rights frames to provide accommodationist
solutions]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Challenging liberal disability rights
frames, [[debility]{.mark} not only [elucidates what is left out of
disability]{.mark} imaginaries and rights politics; it also illuminates
the constitutive absences necessary for capacitating discourses of
disability empowerment, pride, visibility, er and inclusion to take
shape. Thus, I argue, **[disability and debility are not at odds with
each other. Rather, they are necessary supplements in an economy of
injury that claims and promotes disability empowerment at the same time
that it maintains the precarity of certain bodies and populations
precisely through making them available for
maiming.]{.mark}**]{.underline} In a context whereby four-fifths of the
world's people with disabilities are located in what was once hailed as
the "global south," [**liberal interventions are invariably infused with
certitude that disability should be reclaimed as a valuable
differenc**e---the difference of the Other---through rights, visibility,
and empowerment discourses---**[rather than addressing how much
debilitation is caused by global injustice and the war machines of
colonialism, occupation, and U.S. imperialism.]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[**Assemblages of disability, capacity, and debility are elements of
the biopolitical control of populations that foreground risk, prognosis,
life chances, settler colonialism, war impairment, and capitalist
exploitation**.]{.underline}]{.mark} My analysis centralizes [disability
rights as a capacitating frame that recognizes some disabilities at the
expense of other disabilities that do not fit the respectability and
empowerment models of disability progress]{.underline}---what David
Mitchell and Sharon Snyder term the "biopolitics of disability."11 But
the normalization of disability as an empowered status purportedly
recognized by the state is not contradicted by, but rather is produced
through, the creation and sustaining of debilitation on a mass scale.
Debilitation is not a by-product of the operation of biopolitics but an
intended result, functioning both as a disruption of the
non-disabled/disabled binary---as an in-between space---and as a
supplement to disability, that which shadows and often overlaps with
disability**[. [I therefore do not offer debility as an identity; it is
instead a form of massification]{.mark}.]{.underline}** My alternative
conceptualization of **[[the biopolitics of debilitation not only refers
to the remaindering of what the liberal inclusion of disability fails to
fully embrace, but also points to the forms of violent debilitation of
those whose inevitable injuring is assumed by racial
capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline}** I therefore seek to connect
[disability, usually routed through a conceptual frame of
identification, and **debilitation, a practice of rendering populations
available for statistically likely injury.**]{.underline}

#### This debilitation of less developed, less white countries is perpetuated through the right to maim. Extracting value from non white populations using dangerous systems causes the mass debilitation of those populations and puts those who are exploited as a result of the sale of whiteness in a constant cycle of failure.

Michel [Foucault's foundational formulation hinges on all the population
measures that enable some forms of living and inhibit others:
**[birthrates, fertility, longevity, disease, impairment, toxicity,
productivity]{.mark}.**]{.underline} In other words, **[[these
irreducible metrics of biopolitics are also metrics of debility and
capacity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Biopolitics deployed through its
neoliberal guises is a capacitation machine; biopolitics seeks
capacitation for some as a liberal rationale (in some cases) or foil for
the debilitation of many others. It is, in sum, an ableist mechanism
that debilitates. Biopolitics as a conceptual paradigm can thus be read
as a theory of debility and capacity. [Addressing disability directly
forces a new, discrete component into the living/dying pendulum that
forms most discussions of biopolitics: the living dead, death worlds,
necropolitics, slow death, life itself. These frames presume death to be
the ultimate assault, transgression, or goal, and the biopolitical end
point or opposite of life. I am arguing that **[debilitation and the
production of disability are in fact biopolitical ends unto themselves,
with moving neither toward life nor toward death as the aim]{.mark}.**
**[This is]{.mark}** what I call **"[the right to maim]{.mark}": a right
expressive of sovereign power** that is linked to, but not the same as,
"the right to kill." **[Maiming is a source of value extraction from
populations that would otherwise be disposable]{.mark}. [The right to
maim exemplifies the most intensive practice of the biopolitics of
debilitation, where maiming is a sanctioned tactic of settler colonial
rule, justified in protectionist terms and soliciting disability rights
solutions that, while absolutely crucial to aiding some individuals,
unfortunately lead to further perpetuation of
debilitation.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### Hegemony doesn't merely operate through the coercion of classes, but rather operates through structures of consent that allow capitalist discourse to control populations. These structures of consent don't just involve questions of power---instead involving a system of cultural representations the hegemonic regime requires to survive. The best way to resist the cultural elements that protect hegemonic structures is through informal, infra-resistances like grassroots-based organizational networks, direct and guerilla action, and workplace theft. Infra-resistances must play a vital role in resistance to global neoliberal hegemony.

Resistance to International Business: A Neo-Gramscian Approach,"

As we outlined above, [Gramsci's]{.underline} (1971) [[**understanding
of the concept of hegemony highlights that the domination of one social
group over another is not only** **produced through coercion
in**]{.underline}]{.mark} the realms of **[the
[economy]{.mark}]{.underline}**---as many labour process theorists seem
to suggest. [Instead, for Gramsci]{.underline}, ''**[[coercion has to be
ingeniously combined with persuasion and
consent]{.underline}]{.mark}''** (Gramsci, 1971, p. 310)
**[[in]{.underline}]{.mark}** all three spheres: **[[the economy, state
and civil society]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Gramsci]{.underline} (1971,
pp. 12--13) [argues that **[intellectuals play a vital role in the way
this consent is established across these three
spheres]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and [it is through building sustained
consent structures that]{.underline}, what he calls, [a 'social
hegemony' can be organized]{.underline}. This
**[[understanding]{.underline}]{.mark}** of **[[hegemony as something
'social]{.underline}']{.mark}** (Gramsci, 1971) is of great importance,
as [it **[highlights the need to establish consent structures throughout
society]{.mark}**]{.underline}, not just in the workplace. This
[involves]{.underline}, for example, **[[cultural forms of
domination]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As Gill argues, ''[problems of
hegemony **[involve not only questions of power]{.mark}**]{.underline},
authority, credibility and the prestige of a system of rule;
**[[they]{.underline}]{.mark}** **also [[involve the political economy
and aesthetics of its representation in culture]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[media]{.underline}]{.mark}.'' (2003, p.
61). This **[[representation of a hegemonic system in the sphere of
culture]{.underline} [has to be understood]{.underline} [as a process of
struggle]{.underline}]{.mark}** and contestation over signs,
signification and meaning. Today, [**this process of representation**
clearly **involves**]{.underline} formal, corporate structures, such as
billboard and TV advertising by **[multinational
companies]{.underline}** and Hollywood movie productions, as we are
dealing with a well-organized cultural industry that represents and
communicates a social hegemony (Herman & Chomsky, 1994). What is perhaps
not emphasized enough in Herman and Chomsky's (1994) so- called
'propaganda model' is that the hegemony of international media
companies, such as Murdoch's News Corporation, is also sustained and
reproduced informally in the wider spheres of society. For example,
there are probably hundreds of fan-clubs of the American TV series
Friends and many other popular TV shows. These clubs are not coerced
into existence and they are not formal civil society organizations;
instead, they are informal gatherings of people who have their
identities tied up with these TV shows. [This is to give a simple
example of Gramsci's]{.underline} (1971) [point that **[a hegemonic
regime is vitally dependent on cultural and social consent structures
that are of both formal and informal nature]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [If
[the construction of a social **hegemony not only involves formal but
also informal organizational processes**, then **resistance to this
hegemony will also have both formal and informal
aspects**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As mentioned above, [[**a good deal of**
the Gramscian **analyses of resistance to IB focuses on formal and
organized politics**]{.underline}]{.mark}. By [formally organized we
mean the extent that resistance to IB displays characteristics central
to formal organization]{.underline}. **[These include]{.underline}** the
degree [to which its policies and operational mechanisms are publicly
declared and accountable]{.underline}; it also involves a cadre of
professional elites and formally recorded activities via written records
(Weber, 1947). [Attending to the level of organization allows us to
identify two distinct types of resistance]{.underline} (Scott, 1990).
[The first is 'political' resistance against IB]{.underline}, identified
by Levy and Egan (2003), Levy and Newell (2002) among others. [This
entails]{.underline} publicly declared and accountable action, a cadre
of full-time professional specialists whose task it is to exercise
instrumental reason, and a bureau of formal record keeping. This is the
zone of all **[[activities we usually associate with politics such as
trade unions]{.mark} orchestrating a strike]{.underline}** (Hyman,
1989), **[[governments attempting to legislate multinationals, and
NGOs]{.underline}]{.mark}**, such as Greenpeace, engaging in a campaign
against IB operations (Tsoukas, 1999). **[[In contrast, infra-politics
is the dimension of resistance that takes on an informal dimension and
occurs outside official politics]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Scott, 1990).
[**[This]{.mark} informal dimension [spans from]{.mark} [spontaneous
non-organized actions to collectively organized protest
events]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} **The latter can** nevertheless **be regarded
as an informal form of resistance, as many social movement groups
[involve non-professional actors who]{.mark} use a variety of techniques
often handed down through oral traditions, and often [keep no detailed
record of their movement]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Morrill, Zald, & Rao,
2003). **[[This]{.mark} second [type of resistance can therefore be both
non-organized and organized]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [involving everything
from spontaneous resistances to groups using
non-hierarchical]{.underline}]{.mark}[, participatory
[principles]{.mark} in order [to organize their
protest]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [What distinguishes
the]{.underline}]{.mark}**se **[[informal]{.underline}]{.mark}** types
of [[resistance **from the** ]{.mark}**more [formal]{.mark}
forms**]{.underline} **[[is]{.mark} that the former involve
[decentralized, non-hierarchical, grassroots-based organizational
networks, while the latter are often centralized]{.mark},
membership-based, [formally incorporated organizations with
clear]{.mark} reporting [structures and a hierarchical chain of command.
Informal]{.mark} forms of [resistance include a vast hinterland of
political activities including]{.mark} workplace
pilferage]{.underline}** (Mars, 1981), 'culture jamming' (Dery, 1993),
**[[guerrilla action]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Holloway & Pelaez, 1998),
**[[and 'direct action' protests]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Plows, 2006).
As Melucci argues, [[these **informal resistances can** ]{.mark}**be
seen as a [move from the sphere of formal politics to the sphere of
culture]{.mark}**]{.underline}: Social movements seem to shift their
focus from class, race, and other more traditional political issues
towards the cultural ground. In the last thirty years emerging social
conflicts in complex societies have not expressed themselves through
political action, but rather have raised cultural challenges to the
dominant language, to the codes that organize information and shape
social practicesy. [**[The action of movements deliberately
differentiates itself from the model of political organization and
assumes increasing autonomy from political systems]{.underline}**; [it
becomes]{.underline}]{.mark} intimately [[interweaved with every- day
life and individual experience]{.underline}]{.mark}. (1996, pp. 8--9)
**[This move from the realm of traditional political organizing to the
realm of cultural infra-politics is]{.underline}** seen by Melucci
(1996) as [**a recent historical development** that is **connected to
the new social movements** that emerged in the 1960s and
1970s]{.underline}. However, **[from a Gramscian perspective one could
suggest that these [informal, cultural resistances have always played a
vital role in the way capitalist hegemony is
resisted]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In fact, following Blaug (1998), who
has used the example of disorganized, [anarchic German hordes
defeat]{.underline}ing [a hierarchically organized army of Roman
soldiers in the 9th century]{.underline}, we could argue that
**[informal resistance movements have played a role throughout
history]{.underline}**. Nevertheless, what many commentators have
highlighted is that ''in the places of our everyday lives, a new
anti-institutional orientation is in evidence'' (Blaug, 1998, p. 34).
That is, [informal forms of resistance]{.underline}, which cannot only
be seen as resistances against capitalist hegemony as such, but also as
resistances against hierarchical, non-democratic and non-participatory
organiz- ing principles, have [gained]{.underline} in [popularity in
recent decades]{.underline} (Fournier, 2002). One factor that has
supported the emergence of new informal resistance movements against IB
is technology. New information and communication technologies, such as
the mobile phone and the Internet, have aided the recent rise of
informal, decentralized network forms of protest organiza- tion (Diani,
1995; Juris, 2005). Protest events against specific multinational
companies or meetings of the World Economic Forum, IMF or the G8, are
partly made possible because of mobile phone and Internet technologies
enabling the horizontal organizing of vast resistance networks that are
not led by a central organizing committee or leader. This is what Juris
calls a '**[cultural logic of networking]{.underline}'**, which, for
him, **[has]{.underline}** ''**[given rise to what grassroots activists
call a new way of doing politics]{.underline}**. [While the
command-oriented logic of parties and unions is based on recruiting new
members, building unified strategies, political representation, and the
struggle for hegemony, network politics involve the creation of broad
umbrella spaces, where diverse movements and collectives converge around
common hallmarks, while preserving their autonomy and
specificity]{.underline}'' (Juris, 2005, pp. 256--257). **[[This 'new
way of doing politics' therefore involves a range of infra-political and
informal forms of organization, which, we argue, play a vital role in
the resistance]{.mark} against IB [today]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### Thus we affirm an infrapolitics of refusal against the globalization that gives the US the Right To Maim. The debate space is a sphere of the state. Abundant in plan text and framework teams, there is certainly no lack of reinforcement to the dangerous systems of American hegemony that places non white, "third world," peripheral countries in a state of danger, and then ignores the harm that is done to them. Us reading this aff w/o a plan text or resolutionality, places us in solidarity with anti-globalization movements and underground associations alike that act spontaneously, secretly, and outside of specific state action.

**[[The sphere of the state may also be used as a forum for informal
resistance]{.underline}]{.mark}** to IB[. [The participants of
this]{.mark} type of [resistance are those associated with
non-bureaucratized political groups that attempt to influence state
policy through various acts of insurgency]{.mark}]{.underline}. In terms
of our framework, [they attempt to impose clandestine regulation on IB
activities, especially those that threaten local control of key
resources.]{.underline} Because their activities are underground, they
do not have nor seek the level of official accessibility to the state
that mainstream political parties enjoy. [[The Zapatistas in Mexico are
an exemplary case of informal state resistance to
IB]{.underline}]{.mark}. Led by the enigmatic Subcomandante Marcos, the
Zapatistas are a diffuse network of disenfranchized indigenous groups in
the Chiapas district (including the Tzeltal, Mam, Chol, Zoque and
Tojolobal peoples). While they have had considerable influence over
certain governmental polices associated with IB, their revolutionary
philosophy displays little interest in seizing formal state power
(Burbach, Robinson, & Jefferies, 2001). [[The Mexican state and various
dominant parties have been consistently frustrated by the Zapatistas'
unwillingness to be subsumed into the formal institutions of the
state]{.mark}. [They are more concerned with creating]{.mark} what they
call '[democratic room' in order to facilitate struggles against land
privatization, transnational agribusiness and the machinations of the
North American Free-Trade Agreement]{.mark}]{.underline} (The
Zapatistas, 2002). Resistance to IB in the spheres of civil society has
typically received little attention in IB studies (Teegen et al., 2004),
as it challenges questions of legitimacy rather than the distribution of
material resources or regulation of firms. [Formal types of resistance
in civil society usually consist of various bureaucratized associations
that have formed to provide a particular service and polticize the more
problematic practices of IB]{.underline} (Stonich & Bailey, 2000;
Tsoukas, 1999). For example, the UK-based information network, OneWorld,
functions as an interface for hundreds of NGOs that are concerned with
poverty and human rights violations caused by transnational business
activities. Its prime objective is to publicize injustices and transform
public consciousness in civil society by harnessing the ''democratic
potential of the Internet to promote sustainable development and human
rights'' (Warkentin, 2001, p. 157). Maguire, Hardy, and Lawrence (2004)
provide a Canadian example in relation to AIDS service organizations in
Canada which contests the practices of multinational pharmaceutical
companies. They found that the mobilization of strategic discourses in
civil society was a vital means for these NGOs in their task of
undermining the legitimacy of multinational drug companies. However,
what is sometimes overlooked is that **[[resistance in the spheres of
civil society is often of informal, infrapolitical nature. For example,
there are manifold social movement collectives that engage with
particular flashpoints outside the sphere of formal politics and the
state]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Christmann, 2004; Davis, McAdam, Scott, &
Zald, 2005). The target of social movements, like NGOs, is the
legitimacy of particular IB practices. Unlike NGOs, however, **[[many
social movements tend to use less formal resistance strategies since
they do not have a firm bureaucratic base. Indeed, they will often form
'spontaneously' when the need arises]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Crossley,
2003; Lounsbury, Ventresca, & Hirsch, 2004) **[[employing a range of
strategies of 'direct action']{.underline}]{.mark}** (Plows, 2006).
There are many examples of new social movements being mobilized to
resist IB. **[Perhaps the most obvious example is the so-called
anti-globalization movement that has grown in prominence over the last
10 years or so. Protest events in Melbourne, Genoa, Seattle, Prague and
Davos, to name but a few, were swiftly organized in an informal manner,
creating a counter-narrative regarding the inimical effects of
IB]{.underline}** (Starr, 2000). **[[Underground associations]{.mark}
like the Dissent Network [protest at IB meetings such as the WTO, G8 and
the World Economic Forum]{.mark} in order [to gain maximum]{.mark} media
[exposure for their critiques of the power associated with multinational
companies]{.mark}. Another example is the World Social Forum, which has
been a focal point for social movements concerned with international
environmental issues, labour rights, fair trade, healthcare access and
the protection of indigenous cultures without solidifying into a
bureaucratized organizational form]{.underline}** (Sen, Anand, Escobar,
& Waterman, 2004

#### White innocence is juxtaposed against blackness which is set to be viewed as guilty and dangerous. This necessitates the creation of white space where blackness evokes rage, fear, and disgust. Both white innocence and white space are bullets in the chamber of the gun whiteness which aims to shoot down any invocation of blackness.

Weapon", Immanentforms: Thinking About it, August 21, 2015,
https://immanentforms.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/whiteness-is-a-weapon/)

I had an interesting conversation with TJ last night about a very
challenging post on his site titled, bluntly, "[There are no 'good white
people]{.underline}.'" TJ is wrestling here with how [[the
American]{.mark} (and European) [concept of "whiteness" and]{.mark} the
national [environment of white-supremacy distorts all of us (white
people and PoC)]{.mark}]{.underline} [[as individuals and pollutes the
relationships we have]{.mark} with one another]{.underline}. He
concisely brings out the real, devastating and (for the foreseeable
future) inescapable consequences of the fiction of race--the social
reality of the invented category--and he points out the privileged
asymmetry through which people marked as white can pretend to escape
white-supremacy (this is the other side of the burden of knowledge that
Baldwin and Coates elegantly describe). I encourage you to read TJ's
post in its entirety, but I will quote the opening here: Sometimes I
wonder if white people know what a constant state of grace and
forbearance they get from people of color every day. I think so many
white folk like to imagine that they're the "good ones," that they don't
do fucked up or racist things, and that they're not bad and wouldn't
seek to marginalize or hurt POC ever. But honestly, we live in a society
where things are tilted for you every damn day. At any point, any of you
can turn on us. Lovers, friends, family, colleagues. Any of you. [As TJ
and I discussed yesterday, this is,]{.underline} in some ways, [a
statement of our general human condition]{.underline}: goodness isn't a
location you can arrive at or an object you can come to possess.
Goodness is an active principle, and you are only ever as good as your
present actions. Hannah Arendt describes human qualities like goodness,
courage, etc. as "virtues" in Machiavelli's sense of virtue: goodness
(etc.) is an action performed among other human beings, and you are only
good when you are giving a virtuosic performance. Jay Smooth puts it
more simply: being good (being anti-racist, for instance) is like
brushing your teeth; you have to do it every day. Going back to TJ's
terminology, [there are no good white people because you have to perform
your role as an ally every day. You never arrive at the point where you
don't have to think about it or where you can be a little bit racist
because you earned your "good white person" badge]{.underline}. The
reality of that continuous responsibility comes through with painful
clarity in TJ's point that "[At any point, any of you can
turn]{.underline} on us." If you think being constantly on your toes as
a white ally sounds demanding, [imagine being a person of color who can
be betrayed by allies and intimates at any moment.]{.underline} If white
allies live under a constant moral imperative, people of color live
under a constant threat of injury that could arrive without warning from
any direction. **[[White supremacy is racial
terrorism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, even in its most genteel forms; [it
shapes lives through the threat of violence, even when things appear
calm.]{.underline} [As white allies, we have to recognize that
**[whiteness is a weapon]{.mark}.** We are born with this weapon, we
cannot put it down, and we injure people with it]{.underline} when we
forget it is in our hands. [The national (and international) structures
of [white supremacy]{.mark} gave us these weapons to use for our own
benefit]{.underline}. [It designed the weapon of whiteness
to]{.underline} hobble people of color and [give us an advantage over
them in life.]{.underline} [**It [designed its weapon to]{.mark}**
exploit, control and **[destroy black bodies for the benefit of white
people]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We can renounce those designs and live
our lives against the grain of white supremacy, but--and this is a
tragedy for everyone involved--[as long as we live within an environment
structured by white supremacy, we cannot put the weapon
down.]{.underline} We cannot put it down because we are the weapon: [the
structure of white supremacy engraves whiteness into our bodies, and we
cannot escape our bodies.]{.underline} [We live within/as the weapon of
whiteness.]{.underline} We do not have to use our whiteness to attack
others, but, even when we do not use it to intentionally, whiteness
threatens to wound those around us the moment we get careless. Worse
than that, [the weapon of whiteness is a threat even when we are mindful
and careful and conscientious]{.underline}. It is a threat because, as
TJ points out, any one of us can turn on our friends, family, lovers,
etc. at any moment, even if we don't mean to do it. [No degree of
enlightenment or number of good deeds will sheath the blade of our
whiteness or make it incapable of injuring others.]{.underline} Because
we carry and will always carry this destructive weapon with us, we must
dedicate ourselves to mindfulness, to care, and to gratitude for the
grace and forbearance we receive from the PoC who stay with us knowing
that we will hurt them. (As TJ and I discussed last night, a similar
structure also applies to relationships between men and women in
partriarchal environments, to cis-gendered people in transphobic
environments, etc.)

#### Whiteness shoots its bullet of white innocence to kill the black body. 

#### White innocence criminalizes blackness. This takes the form of the largest carceral state in the world. It necessitates a person receive validation through innocence. Through having whiteness. Instead, choose to murder all motorists rather than running into traffic to prove a car will run you over just to meet the state's expectations. The carceral state is key to this process of running over the black subject. Through "tough on crime" policies, it captures over 920,000 black bodies under the guise of "criminality" which exacerbates economic issues in black communities leading to further incarceration.

Saidiya V. Hartman: I think that gets at one of the fundamental ethical
questions/problems/crises for the West: the status of difference and the
status of the other. It's as though in order to come to any recognition
of common humanity, the other must be assimilated, meaning in this case,
utterly displaced and effaced: "Only if I can see myself in that
position can I understand the crisis of that position." That is the
logic of the moral and political discourses we see every day --- the
need for the innocent black subject to be victimized by a racist state
in order to see the racism of the racist state. You have to be exemplary
in your goodness, as opposed to \... Frank Wilderson: \[laughter\] A
nigga on the warpath! While I was reading the local newspaper I came
across a story that caught my attention. The article was about [[a 17
year-old boy]{.mark} from Baltimore [named Isaiah Simmons]{.mark} who
[died in a juvenile facility]{.mark} in 2007 [when]{.mark} five to seven
[counselors suffocated him while restraining him for hours. After he
stopped responding they dumped his body in the snow]{.mark} and did not
call for medical assistance for over 40 minutes. In late March 2012, the
case was thrown out completely and none of the counselors involved in
his murder were charged with anything. [The article]{.mark} I found
online [about the case was titled "Charges Dropped Against 5 In Juvenile
Offender's Death."]{.mark} By [emphasizing]{.mark} that [it was a
juvenile offender who died]{.mark}, the article is quick to flag Isaiah
as a criminal, [as if to signal]{.mark} to readers that [his death is
not worthy of sympathy or being taken up by]{.mark} civil rights
[activists]{.mark}.]{.underline} Every comment left on the article was
crude and contemptuous --- the general sentiment was that his death was
no big loss to society. The news about the case being thrown out barely
registered at all. [There was no public outcry, no call to action, no
discussion of the many issues bound up with the case --- youth
incarceration, racism, the privatization of prisons and jails (he died
at a private facility), medical neglect, state violence, and so forth
--- though to be fair, there was a critical response when the case
initially broke.]{.underline} For weeks after reading the article I kept
contemplating the question: What is the difference between Trayvon
Martin and Isaiah Simmons? Which cases galvanize activists into action,
and which are ignored completely? In the wake of the Jena 6, Troy Davis,
Oscar Grant, Trayvon Martin, and other high profile
cases,[1](https://www.liesjournal.net/final-lies-GUTS-bleeds.html#footnote-081)
I have taken note of the patterns that structure political appeals,
particularly the way innocence becomes a necessary precondition for the
launching of anti-racist political campaigns. These campaigns often
center on prosecuting and harshly punishing the individuals responsible
for overt and locatable acts of racist violence, thus positioning the
State and the criminal justice system as an ally and protector of the
oppressed[. If the "innocence" of a Black victim is not established, he
or she will not become a suitable spokesperson for the cause. If you are
Black, have a drug felony, and are attempting to file a complaint with
the ACLU regarding habitual police harassment --- you are probably not
going to be legally represented by them or any other civil rights
organization anytime
soon.[2](https://www.liesjournal.net/final-lies-GUTS-bleeds.html#footnote-080)
An empathetic structure of feeling based on appeals to innocence has
come to ground contemporary anti-racist politics. Within this framework,
empathy can only be established when a person meets the standards of
authentic victimhood and moral purity, which requires Black people, in
the words of Frank Wilderson, to be shaken free of ~~"niggerization."~~
Social, political, cultural, and legal recognition only happens when a
person is thoroughly whitewashed, neutralized, and made
unthreatening.]{.underline} The "spokesperson" model of doing activism
(isolating specific exemplary cases) also tends to emphasize the
individual, rather than the collective nature of the injury. Framing
oppression in terms of individual actors is a liberal tactic that
dismantles collective responses to oppression and diverts attention from
the larger picture. [[Using "innocence]{.mark}" as the foundation [to
address anti-Black violence is an appeal to the white imaginary]{.mark},
though these arguments are certainly made by people of color as well.
Relying on [this]{.mark} framework re-entrenches a logic that
[criminalizes race]{.mark} and constructs subjects as docile. A [liberal
politics]{.mark} of recognition can only [reproduce]{.mark} a
[guilt-innocence schematization]{.mark} that [fails to grapple with the
fact that there is an]{.mark} a priori [association of Blackness with
guilt]{.mark} (criminality).]{.underline} Perhaps association is too
generous --- there is a flat-out conflation of the terms. As Frank
Wilderson noted in "Gramsci's Black Marx," the cop's answer to the Black
subject's question --- why did you shoot me? --- follows a tautology: "I
shot you because you are Black; you are Black because I shot
you."[3](https://www.liesjournal.net/final-lies-GUTS-bleeds.html#footnote-079)
In the words of Fanon, the cause is the
consequence.[4](https://www.liesjournal.net/final-lies-GUTS-bleeds.html#footnote-078)
[Not only are Black men assumed guilty until proven innocent, Blackness
itself is considered synonymous with guilt. [Authentic victimhood,
passivity, moral purity, and the adoption of a whitewashed position are
necessary for recognition in the eyes of the State]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Wilderson, quoting N.W.A, notes that "a nigga on the warpath" cannot be
a proper subject of
empathy.[5](https://www.liesjournal.net/final-lies-GUTS-bleeds.html#footnote-077)
[The [desire for recognition compels us to be allies with]{.mark},
rather than enemies [of the State]{.mark}, to sacrifice ourselves in
order [to meet the standards of victimhood]{.mark}, [to throw our bodies
into traffic to prove that the car will hit us rather than calling for
the execution of all motorists.]{.mark}]{.underline} This is also the
logic of rape revenge narratives --- only after a woman is thoroughly
degraded can we begin to tolerate her rage (but outside of films and
books, violent women are not tolerated even when they have the "moral"
grounds to fight back, as exemplified by the high rates of women who are
imprisoned or sentenced to death for murdering or assaulting abusive
partners). We may fall back on such appeals for strategic reasons --- to
win a case or to get the public on our side --- but there is a problem
when our strategies reinforce a framework in which revolutionary and
insurgent politics are unimaginable. I also want to argue that a
politics founded on appeals to innocence is anachronistic because it
does not address the transformation and re-organization of racist
strategies in the post-civil rights era[. A [politics of
innocence]{.mark} is [only]{.mark} capable of [acknowledg]{.mark}ing
examples of direct, [individualized acts of racist violence]{.mark}
while [obscuring]{.mark} the [racism]{.mark} of a putatively colorblind
liberalism [that operates on a structural level]{.mark}. [Posing the
issue in terms of personal prejudice feeds the fallacy of racism as an
individual intention]{.mark}, feeling or personal prejudice, though
there is certain a psychological and affective dimension of racism that
exceeds the individual in that it is shaped by social norms and media
representations. [The liberal]{.mark} colorblind [paradigm]{.mark} of
racism [submerges race beneath]{.mark} the "commonsense" logic of
[crime]{.mark} and punishment. [This]{.mark} effectively
[conceals]{.mark} [racism]{.mark}, because [it is not]{.mark} considered
[racist to be against crime]{.mark}. Cases like [the execution of Troy
Davis,]{.mark} where the courts come under scrutiny for racial bias,
also [legitimize state violence by treating such cases as
exceptional]{.mark}.]{.underline} The political response to the murder
of Troy Davis does not challenge the assumption that communities need to
clean up their streets by rounding up criminals, [for [it relies on the
claim]{.mark} that [Davis is not one of those feared criminals]{.mark},
but an innocent Black man. [Innocence]{.mark}, however, [is]{.mark} just
[code for nonthreatening to white civil society.]{.mark} Troy Davis is
differentiated from other Black men --- the bad ones --- and the legal
system is diagnosed as being infected with racism, masking the fact that
the legal system is the constituent mechanism through which racial
violence is carried out (wishful last-minute appeals to the right to a
fair trial reveal this --- as if trials were ever intended to be fair!).
The State is imagined to be deviating from its intended role as
protector of the people, rather than being the primary
perpetrator]{.underline}. H. Rap Brown provides a sobering reminder
that, "Justice means 'just-us-white-folks.' There is no redress of
grievance for Blacks in this
country."[6](https://www.liesjournal.net/final-lies-GUTS-bleeds.html#footnote-076)
While there are countless examples of overt racism, [[Black social (and
physical) death is]{.mark} primarily [achieved via]{.mark} a coded
[discourse of "criminality" and a mediated forms of state
violence]{.mark} carried out by a impersonal carceral apparatus (the
matrix of [police, prisons, the legal system, prosecutors, parole
boards, prison guards, probation officers, etc]{.mark}).]{.underline} In
other words --- incidents where a biased individual fucks with or
murders a person of color can be identified as racism to "conscientious
persons," but [the racism underlying the systematic imprisonment of
Black Americans under the pretense of the War on Drugs is more difficult
to locate and generally remains invisible because it is spatially
confined.]{.underline} When it is visible, it fails to arouse public
sympathy, even among the Black leadership. As Loïc Wacquant, scholar of
the carceral state, asks, "What is the chance that white Americans will
identify with Black convicts when even the Black leadership has turned
its back on
them?"[7](https://www.liesjournal.net/final-lies-GUTS-bleeds.html#footnote-075)
The abandonment of Black convicts by civil rights organizations is
reflected in the history of these organizations. From 1975-86, the NAACP
and the Urban League identified imprisonment as a central issue, and the
disproportionate incarceration of Black Americans was understood as a
problem that was structural and political. Spokespersons from the civil
rights organizations related imprisonment to the general confinement of
Black Americans. Imprisoned Black men were, as Wacquant notes, portrayed
inclusively as "brothers, uncles, neighbors,
friends."[8](https://www.liesjournal.net/final-lies-GUTS-bleeds.html#footnote-074)
Between 1986-90 there was a dramatic shift in the rhetoric and official
policy of the NAACP and the Urban League that is exemplary of the turn
to a politics of innocence. By the early 1990s, the NAACP had dissolved
its prison program and stopped publishing articles about rehabilitation
and post-imprisonment issues. Meanwhile these organizations began to
embrace the rhetoric of individual responsibility and a tough-on-crime
stance that encouraged Blacks to collaborate with police to get drugs
out of their neighborhoods, even going as far as endorsing harsher
sentences for minors and recidivists. Black convicts, initially a part
of the "we" articulated by civil rights groups, became them. Wacquant
writes, "[This [reticence]{.mark} \[[to advocate for Black
convicts]{.mark}\] [is]{.mark} further [reinforced by]{.mark} the fact,
noted long ago by W.E.B. DuBois, that [the]{.mark} tenuous [position of
the black bourgeoisie]{.mark} in the socioracial hierarchy rests
critically on its [ability to distance itself from its unruly
lower-class brethren]{.mark}: to offset the symbolic disability of
blackness, middle-class African Americans must forcefully communicate to
whites that they have 'absolutely no sympathy and no known connections
with any black man who has committed a
crime.'"]{.underline}[9](https://www.liesjournal.net/final-lies-GUTS-bleeds.html#footnote-073)
When the Black leadership and middle-class Blacks differentiate
themselves from poorer Blacks, they feed into a notion of Black
exceptionalism that is used to dismantle anti-racist struggles. [[This
class of exceptional Blacks]{.mark} (Barack Obama, Condoleeza Rice,
Colin Powell) [supports the]{.mark} collective [delusion of a post-race
society.]{.mark}]{.underline} The shift in the rhetoric and policy of
civil rights organizations is perhaps rooted in a fear of affirming the
conflation of Blackness and criminality by advocating for prisoners.
However, not only have these organizations abandoned Black prisoners ---
they shore up and extend the Penal State by individualizing,
depoliticizing, and decontextualizing the issue of "crime and
punishment" and vilifying those most likely to be subjected to
racialized state violence. [The [dis-identification with poor, urban
Black Americans is not limited to Black men]{.mark}, but also [Black
women]{.mark} who [are vilified via the]{.mark} figure of the [Welfare
Queen]{.mark}: a lazy, sexually irresponsible burden on society
(particularly hard-working white Americans). [The Welfare State and the
Penal State complement one another]{.mark}, as [Clinton]{.mark}'s 1998
statements denouncing prisoners and ex-prisoners who receive welfare or
social security reveal: he [condemns former prisoners receiving welfare
assistance for]{.mark} deviously [committing "fraud and abuse" against
"working families" who "play by the
rules."]{.mark}[10](https://www.liesjournal.net/final-lies-GUTS-bleeds.html#footnote-072)
Furthermore, this complementarity is gendered. Black women are the shock
absorbers of the social crisis created by the Penal State: the
[incarceration of Black men]{.mark} profoundly [increases the burden put
on Black women, who are force to perform more waged and unwaged (caring)
labor]{.mark}, raise children alone, [and are punished by the State when
their husbands or family members are convicted of crimes]{.mark} (for
example, a family cannot receive housing assistance if someone in the
household has been convicted of a drug felony). The re-configuration of
the Welfare State under the Clinton Administration (which imposed
stricter regulations on welfare recipients) further intensified the
backlash against poor Black women. On this view, the Welfare State is
the apparatus used to regulate poor Black women who are not subjected to
regulation, directed chiefly at Black men, by the Penal State --- though
it is important to note that t[he feminization of poverty and
the]{.mark} punitive [turn in]{.mark} non-violent [crime policy led to
an 400% increase in the female prison population between 1980 and the
late
1990s.]{.mark}[11](https://www.liesjournal.net/final-lies-GUTS-bleeds.html#footnote-071)Racialized
patterns of incarceration and the assault on the urban poor are not seen
as a form of racist state violence because, [in the eyes of the public,
convicts]{.mark} (along with their families and associates) [deserve
such treatment]{.mark}.]{.underline} The politics of innocence directly
fosters this culture of vilification, even when it is used by civil
rights organizations. .

#### Thus, we advocate for abolition.

#### The creation of the resolution is the creation of a white space. If you want to engage you must translate yourself to be comprehensible to whiteness. For this, whiteness must be able to see itself in the affirmative. It does this through T and FW forcing the affirmative to affirm ONLY acceptable advocacies such as the ones it sees itself in which necessitates the inclusion of the state. The affirmative should not be forced to engage with the state. Regularly blackness is removed from white spaces such as the state and must itself become white to engage with the state. It must itself become innocent. That forecloses any extra-state action which would force us to conceive of politics within the liberal colorblind model which doesn't allow us to engage with the structural nature of racism and fails to consider that those who are considered guilty by the state to be subjects of state violence. It also forces anti-black events to be whitewashed in order to make it comprehensible and appropriated by Eurocentric political models or be ignored. Forcing us to throw ourselves into traffic just to please them. Using alternative forms of debate, we break the norm which allows for us to look beyond plan based affirmatives and to the eventual abolition of the resolution.

#### The carceral state removes black intellectuals from the formal sphere of academia by placing them in prisons and subjecting them to state violence. Their specific analysis of the carceral system is key to abolish the caste system instituted between formal and informal academic spaces. We must analyze anti-black violence through the lens of those who have experienced it and act upon their analysis.

#### Thus, as non-black abolitionists, we pull from the analysis of Angela Davis.

#### Her analysis points to abolition being necessary to see futures beyond prisons and ensure decarceration.

But even those who do not consciously decide to watch a documentary or
dramatic program on the topic of prisons inevitably consume prison
images, whether they choose to or not, by the simple fact of watching
movies or TV. It is virtually impossible to avoid consuming images of
prison. In 1997, I was myself quite astonished to find, when I
interviewed women in three Cuban prisons, that most of them narrated
their prior awareness of prisons-that is, before they were actually
incarcerated-as coming from the many Hollywood films they had seen.
[[The prison is one of the most important features of our image
environment. This has caused us to take the existence of prisons for
granted. The prison has become a key ingredient of our common
sense]{.mark}. It is there, all around us. [We do not question whether
it should exist]{.mark}. It has become so much a part of our lives that
[it requires a great feat of the imagination to envision life beyond the
prison]{.mark}. This is not to dismiss the profound changes that have
occurred in the way public conversations about the prison are conducted.
Ten years ago, even as the drive to expand the prison system reached its
zenith, there were very few critiques of this process available to the
public. In fact most people had no idea about the immensity of this
expansion. This was the period during which internal changes-in part
through the application of new technologies-led the U.S. prison system
in a much more repressive direction]{.underline}. Whereas previous
classifications had been confined to low, medium, and maximum security,
a new category was invented-that of the super-maximum security prison,
or the supermax. The turn toward increased repression in a prison
system, distinguished from the beginning of its history by its
repressive regimes, caused some journalistsl public intellectualsl and
progressive agencies to oppose the growing reliance on prisons to solve
social problems that are actually exacerbated by mass incarceration.
[[In 1990,]{.mark} the Washington-based [Sentencing Project published a
study of U.S. populations in prison and jail, and on parole and
probation,]{.mark} which [concluded that one in four black men
between]{.mark} the ages of [twenty and twenty-nine were among these
numbers. Five years later, a]{.mark} second [study revealed]{.mark} that
[this percentage had soared to]{.mark} almost [one in three]{.mark}
(32.2 percent). Moreover, more than one in ten Latino men in this same
age range were in jail or prison, or on probation or parole. [The second
study]{.mark} also [revealed that the group experiencing the greatest
increase was black women, whose imprisonment increased by seventy -eight
percent]{.mark}.13 According to the Bureau of Tustice Statistics,
[African Americans as a whole now represent the majority of state and
federal prisoners]{.mark}, with a total of 803,400 black inmates-118,600
more than the total number of white inmates]{.underline}.14 During the
late 1990s major articles on prison expansion appeared in Newsweek,
Harper\'s, Emerge, and Atlantic Monthly. Even Colin Powell raised the
question of the rising number of black men in prison when he spoke at
the 2000 Republican National Convention, which declared George W. Bush
its presidential candidate. Over the last few years the previous absence
of critical positions on prison expansion in the political arena has
given way to proposals for prison reform. While public discourse has
become more flexible, the emphasis is almost inevitably on generating
the changes that will produce a better prison system. In other words,
the increased flexibility that has allowed for critical discussion of
the problems associated with the expansion of prisons also restricts
this discussion to the question of prison reform. [[As important as some
reforms may be-the elimination of sexual abuse and medical neglect in
women\'s prison, for example-frameworks that rely exclusively on reforms
help to produce the stultifying idea that nothing lies beyond the
prison]{.mark}. Debates about [strategies of decarceration]{.mark},
which [should be the focal point of our conversations on the prison
crisis]{.mark}, tend to be marginalized when reform takes the center
stage. [The most immediate question today is how to prevent the further
expansion of prison populations and how to bring]{.mark} as many
[imprisoned women and men]{.mark} as possible [back into what prisoners
call lithe free world.\" How can we move to decriminalize drug use and
the trade in sexual services? How can we take seriously strategies of
restorative rather than exclusively punitive justice? Effective
alternatives involve]{.mark} both [transformation of]{.mark} the
techniques for [addressing \"crime\" and]{.mark} of the [social and
economic conditions]{.mark} that track so many children from poor
communities, and especially communities of color, into the juvenile
system and then on to prison. [The most difficult and urgent challenge
today is that of creatively exploring new terrains of justice, where the
prison no longer serves as our major anchor.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Frame this debate viewing anti-black violence and black radicalism as the primary issue and focus in this round. Any other frame of analysis appropriates events to fit Eurocentric models which are unable to explain phenomena in a conclusive manner.

TRANSLATION [[When]{.mark} an instance of [racist violence takes place
on white turf]{.mark}, as in the cases of Trayvon Martin and Oscar
Grant, [there is]{.mark} still [the problem of
translation]{.mark}.]{.underline} I contend that the politics of
[[innocence]{.mark} [renders such violence comprehensible only if one is
capable of seeing themselves in that position]{.mark}. This framework
often requires that a white narrative (posed as the neutral, universal
perspective) be grafted onto the incidents that conflict with this
narrative.]{.underline} I was baffled when a call for a protest march
for Trayvon Martin made on the Occupy Baltimore website said, "The case
of Trayvon Martin -- is symbolic of the war on youth in general and the
devaluing of young people everywhere." I doubt George Zimmerman was
thinking, I gotta shoot that boy because he's young! No mention of race
or anti-Blackness could be found in the statement; race had been
translated to youth, a condition that white people can imaginatively
access. At the march, speakers declared that the case of "Trayvon Martin
is not a race issue --- it's a 99% issue!" As Saidiya Hartman has
asserted in a conversation with Frank Wilderson, "the other must be
assimilated, meaning in this case, utterly displaced and
effaced."[[19](https://www.liesjournal.net/final-lies-GUTS-bleeds.html#footnote-063)
[In]{.mark} late [2011,]{.mark} [riots exploded across London]{.mark}
and the UK [after Mark Duggan, a Black man, was murdered by the
police]{.mark}. Many [leftist and liberals were unable to grapple with
the unruly expression of rage]{.mark} among largely poor and unemployed
people of color, and refused to support the passionate outburst they saw
as disorderly and delinquent. Even leftists fell into the trap of
framing the State and property owners (including small business owners)
as victims while criticizing rioters for being politically incoherent
and opportunistic. Slavoj Žižek, for instance, responded by dismissing
the riots as a "meaningless outburst" in an article cynically titled
"Shoplifters of the World Unite." Well-meaning [leftists]{.mark} who
felt obligated to [affirm the riots]{.mark} often did so [by imposing a
narrative of political consciousness and coherence]{.mark} onto the
amorphous eruption, sometimes recasting the participants as "the
proletariat" (an unemployed person is just a worker without a job, I was
once told) or dissatisfied consumers whose acts of theft and looting
shed light on capitalist
ideology.[20](https://www.liesjournal.net/final-lies-GUTS-bleeds.html#footnote-062)[These
leftists]{.mark} were quick to [purge and re-articulate the anti-social
and delinquent elements]{.mark} of the riots [rather than integrate them
into their analysis]{.mark}, insisting on figuring the rioter-subject as
"a sovereign deliberate consciousness,"]{.underline} to borrow a phrase
from Gayatri Chakravorty
Spivak.[21](https://www.liesjournal.net/final-lies-GUTS-bleeds.html#footnote-061)
Following the 1992 LA
riots,[22](https://www.liesjournal.net/final-lies-GUTS-bleeds.html#footnote-060)
leftist commentators often opted to define the event as a rebellion
rather than a riot as a way to highlight the political nature of
people's actions. [[This attempt to reframe]{.mark} the public
[discourse]{.mark} is borne of "good intentions" (the desire to combat
the conservative media's portrayal of the riots as "pure criminality"),
but it also [reflects the an impulse to contain, consolidate,
appropriate, and accommodate events that do not fit political models
grounded in white, Euro-American traditions.]{.mark}]{.underline} When
the mainstream media portrays social disruptions as apolitical,
criminal, and devoid of meaning, leftists often respond by describing
them as politically reasoned. Here, the confluence of political and
anti-social tendencies in a riot/rebellion are neither recognized nor
embraced. [Certainly some who participated in the London riots were
armed with sharp analyses of structural violence and explicitly
political messages --- the rioters were obviously not politically or
demographically homogenous. However, sympathetic radicals tend to
privilege the voices of those who are educated and politically astute,
rather than listening to those who know viscerally that they are fucked
and act without first seeking moral approval.]{.underline} Some leftists
and radicals were reluctant to affirm the purely disruptive
perspectives, like those expressed by a woman from Hackney, London who
said, "We're not all gathering together for a cause, we're running down
Foot

wine. When asked what they were doing, they spoke of the giddy "madness"
of it all, the "good fun" they were having, and said that they were
showing the police and the rich that "we can do what we
want."[24](https://www.liesjournal.net/final-lies-GUTS-bleeds.html#footnote-058)
Translating riots into morally palatable terms is another manifestation
of the appeal to innocence --- rioters, looters, criminals, thieves, and
disruptors are not proper victims and hence, not legitimate political
actors. Morally ennobled victimization has become the necessary
precondition for determining which grievances we are willing to
acknowledge and authorize. With that being said, my reluctance to jam
Black rage into a white framework is not an assertion of the political
viability of a pure politics of refusal. [[White anarchists,
ultra-leftists, post-Marxists, and insurrectionists]{.mark} who adhere
to and fetishize the position of being "for nothing and against
everything" [are equally eager to appropriate events]{.mark} like the
2011 London riots for their (non)agenda. [They insist on]{.mark} an
[analysis focused on]{.mark} the crisis of [capitalism]{.mark}, [which
downplays anti-Blackness and ignores]{.mark} forms of gratuitous
[violence that cannot be attributed solely to economic forces.]{.mark}
Like liberals, [post-left and anti-social interpretive frameworks
generate political narratives structured by white assumptions,]{.mark}
which delimits which questions are posed which categories are the most
analytically useful. Tiqqun explore the ways in which we are enmeshed in
power through our identities, but tend to [focus on forms of power that
operate by an investment in life]{.mark} (sometimes call biopolitics)
rather than, as Achille Mbembe writes, "the power and the capacity to
decide who may live and who must die" (sometimes called
necropolitics).[25](https://www.liesjournal.net/final-lies-GUTS-bleeds.html#footnote-057)
This framework [is]{.mark} decidedly [white,]{.mark} for [it
asserts]{.mark} that [power is not enacted by direct relations of force
or violence]{.mark}, and that the capitalism reproduces itself by
inducing us to produces ourselves, to express our identities through
consumer choices, to base our politics on the affirmation of our
marginalized identities. [This configuration of power as purely
generative and dispersed]{.mark} completely [eclipses the realities of
policing, the militarization of the carceral system, the terrorization
of people of color, the institutional violence of the Welfare State and
the Penal State, and of Black and Native social
death.]{.mark}]{.underline} While prisons certainly "produce" race, a
generative configuration of power that minimizes direct relations of
force can only be theorized from a white subject position. Among
ultra-left tendencies, communization theory notably looks beyond the
wage relation in its attempt to grasp the dynamics of late-capitalism.
[Writing about Théorie Communiste (TC), Maya Andrea Gonzalez notes that
"TC [focus on the reproduction of the capital-labor relation, rather
than on the production of value]{.mark}. This change of focus [allows
them to bring within their purview]{.mark} the set of [relations
that]{.mark} actually [construct capitalist social life]{.mark} --
beyond the walls of the factory or
office."[26](https://www.liesjournal.net/final-lies-GUTS-bleeds.html#footnote-056)[However]{.mark},
while this reframing may shed light on relations that constitute social
life outside the workplace, it does not shed light on social death, for
[relations defined by social death are not reducible to the
capital-labor relation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rather than oppose class to
race, Frank Wilderson draws our attention to the difference between
being exploited under capitalism (the worker) and being marked as
disposable or superfluous to capitalism (the slave, the prisoner). He
writes, "[The [absence of Black subjectivity]{.mark} from the crux of
radical discourse [is symptomatic of \[an\] inability to cope with the
possibility that the generative subject of capitalism]{.mark}, the Black
body of the 15th and 16th centuries, [and the generative subject that
resolves late capital's over-accumulation crisis]{.mark}, the Black
(incarcerated) body of the 20th and 21st centuries, [do not reify the
basic categories that structure conflict within civil society]{.mark}:
the categories of work and
exploitation."]{.underline}[27](https://www.liesjournal.net/final-lies-GUTS-bleeds.html#footnote-055)
Historian Orlando Patterson similarly insists on understanding slavery
in terms of social death rather than labor or
exploitation.[28](https://www.liesjournal.net/final-lies-GUTS-bleeds.html#footnote-054)
Forced labor is undoubtedly a part of the slave's experience, but it is
not what defines the slave relation. Economic exploitation does not
explain the phenomena of racialized incarceration; an analysis of
capitalism that fails to address anti-Blackness, or only addresses it as
a byproduct of capitalism, is deficient.

\*edited for racial language

One of the most poignant aspects of William Goodell\'s contemporaneous
study of the North American slave codes gives precise expression to the
tortures and instruments of cap- tivity. Reporting an instance of
Jonathan Edwards\'s observations on the tortures of enslave- ment,
Goodell narrates: \"**[The smack of the whip is all day long in the ears
of those who are on the plantation, or in the vicinity; and it is used
with such dexterity and severity as not only to lacerate the skin, but
to tear out small portions of the flesh at almost every stake\" \[221\].
The anatomical specifications of rupture, of altered human tissue, take
on the objective description of laboratory prose-eyes beaten out, arms,
backs, skulls branded, a left jaw, a right ankle, punctured; teeth
missing, as the calculated work of iron, whips, chains, knives, the
canine patrol, the bullet. These undecipherable markings on the captive
body render a kind of hieroglyphics of the flesh whose severe
disjunctures come to be hidden to the cultural seeing by skin
color.]{.underline}** We might well ask if this phenomenon of marking
and branding actually \"transfers\" from one generation to another,
finding its various symbolic substitutions in an efficacy of meanings
that repeat the initiating moments? As Elaine Scarry describes the
mechanisms of torture \[Scarry 27-59**[\], these lacerations, woundings,
fissures, tears, scars, openings, ruptures, lesions, rendings, punctures
of the flesh create the distance between what I would designate a
cultural vestibularity and the culture]{.underline}**, whose state
apparatus, including judges, attorneys, \"owners,\" \"soul drivers,\"
\"overseers,\" and \"men of God,\" apparently colludes with a protocol
of \"search and destroy.\" This body whose flesh carries the female and
the male to the frontiers of survival bears in person the marks of a
cultural text whose inside has been turned outside. The flesh is the
concentration of \"ethnicity\" that contemporary critical discourses
neither acknowledge nor discourse away. It is this \"flesh and blood\"
entity, in the vestibule (or \"pre-view\") of a colonized North America,
that is essentially ejected from \"The Female Body in Western Culture\"
\[see Suleiman, ed.\], but it makes good theory, or commemorative
\"herstory\" to want to \"forget,\" or to have failed to realize, that
the African female subject, under these historic conditions, is not only
the target of rape- in one sense, an interiorized violation of body and
mind - but also the topic of specifically externalized acts of torture
and prostration that we imagine as the peculiar province of male
brutality and torture inflicted by other males. A female body strung
from a tree limb, or bleeding from the breast on any given day of field
work because the \"overseer,\" standing the length of a whip, has popped
her flesh open, adds a lexical and living dimension to the narratives of
women in culture and society \[Davis 9\]. This materialized scene of
unprotected female flesh - of female flesh \"ungendered\"-offers a
praxis and a theory, a text for living and for dying, and a method for
reading both through their diverse mediations**[. Among the myriad uses
to which the enslaved community was put,]{.underline}** Goodell
identifies its value for medical research: \"**[Assortments of diseased,
damaged, and disabled Negroes, deemed incurable and otherwise worthless
are bought up, it seems . .. by medical institu- tions, to be
experimented and operated upon, for purposes of \'medical education\'
and the interest of medical science]{.underline}**\" \[8[6-87;
Goodell\'s emphasis\]. From the Charleston Mercury for October 12, 1838,
Goodell notes this advertisement: **\'To planters and others. - Wanted,
fifty Negroes \[slaves\], any person, having sick Negroes \[slaves\],
considered incurable by their respective physicians, and wishing to
dispose of them, Dr. S. will pay cash for Negroes \[slaves\] affected
with scrofula, or king\'s evil, confirmed hypochondriasm, apoplexy,
diseases of the liver, kidneys, spleen, stomach and in- testines,
bladder and its appendages, diarrhea, dysentery, etc. The highest cash
price will be paid, on application as above.**]{.underline}\' at No. 110
Church Street, Charleston. \[87; Goodell\'s emphasis\] This profitable
\"atomizing\" of the captive body provides another angle on the divided
flesh: we lose any hint or suggestion of a dimension of ethics, of
relatedness between human personality and its anatomical features,
between one human personality and another, be- tween human personality
and cultural institutions. To that extent, **[the procedures adopted for
the captive flesh demarcate a total objectification, as the entire
captive community becomes a living laboratory.]{.underline}**

Nirmala Erevelles, drawing on Hortense Spillers (1987), Mama's Baby,
Papa's Maybe, an essay that speaks to the theft of Black subjectivities
through the Atlantic Slave Trade foregrounds, 'how **[race and
disability are imbricated in their collective formation of the black
disabled body' (]{.underline}**Erevelles, 2011: 39). Despite
[Spillers]{.underline} only citing disability once, [**the entanglement
of race and disability are clear in** her 'seared, divided,
**ripped-apartness, riveted to the ship's hole**, fallen or "escaped"
overboard' (1987: 67) **narrative of the flesh.**]{.underline} The
Middle Passage was a journey of unimaginable cruelty and violation;
where the putrefying odours of confinement coalesced with a desperate
unknowing terror of its Black human prisoners. But this was not the end.
[On land these casual and willful acts of torture would continue,
intensifying and hardening to become a racist culture and practice that
White nations would employ to degrade, dismember and disable Black
lives. William **Goodell's** (1853) affective **account of North
American slave codes details the** branding, burning, **cutting and
castrating**; eyes beaten out, jaws broken**, teeth missing; of arms and
legs broken; backs slashed** and skulls cleft. These were delivered with
an array of axes, balls, chains, collars, dogs, hand irons, knives,
rifles and swords]{.underline}. Yet as Goodell goes on to explain, this
malice was also inflicted with subtlety and precision: 'the smack of the
whip is all day long in the ears of those who are on the plantation, or
in the vicinity; and it is used with such dexterity and severity as not
to lacerate the skin but to tear out small portions of the flesh at
almost every strike' (1853: 221). [These carnal practices of injury and
mutilation were not only to quell]{.underline} (even the possibility)
[of insurrection but were used to undergird ideas of Black imperfection,
monstrosity and depravity.]{.underline} All of this takes place within
historical conditions and a socio-economic system that can appropriate
and commodify African labour so that **['black bodies become disabled
and disabled bodies black']{.underline}** (Erevelles, 2011: 40). The
Atlantic slave world order underscored the constitutive boundaries of
race and disability and determined who did, and who did not matter, of
material and immaterial bodies. [When Stuart Hall (1991: 48) evocatively
wrote: 'I am the sugar at the bottom of the English cup of tea' he was
alluding to the invisibility of the Black Atlantic, the racialised
labour that has for centuries produced so much of the identity and
culture that defines 'Englishness'. Hall's point was **that slavery and
subordination invisibly sweetened what the English culture consumed.**
What also remains invisible is how intertwined race and disability were
in these commodified processes of enslavement]{.underline}. The
historian Stefanie Kennedy's (2015) brilliant work on New World slavery
viscerally brings to life Black labourers' dangerous proximity to
impairment and disability, charting the movement of Black bodies from
ship to plantation, to factory. She argues that it is erroneous to
suggest that (White) British workers were the first to experience the
pain and misery of industrialised life, as this was 'predicated on an
early suffering endured by enslaved labourers on Caribbean plantations'
(2015: 41). [**The sugar factory was a place of quotidian hazards, where
enslaved bodies were regularly** scalded, **severed and cut
asunder.**]{.underline}

The literary and **[performance narratives]{.underline}** in question
**[deal with scenarios of affliction and traumatic
experiences.]{.underline}** Through **[close readings of these texts
written by women from different ethnic backgrounds and
nationalities]{.underline},** I argue that [**their narratives re-member
images of common experiences and strength**.]{.underline} With the term
"re-member," I refer to the texts' ability to reintegrate traumatic
memories into collective cultural memory, to cope with repressed
sexuality and other traumas, and to repair identities through narrative.
The hyphen in "re-member" also differentiates my term from the term
remembering---usually associated with the psyche. **"[Re-member" places
emphasis on the central role of the body in tune with mind and spirit in
the act of remembrance and in healing rituals]{.underline}**.[7 Breaking
down remember **into re-member also implies a struggle with written
language's imposing logocentric system.**]{.underline} It implies
choosing corporal or intuitive discourses to complement the written
text, to accept discursive resistance, and to return to pretext
experiences. And [unlike national acts of remembrance, **re-membering
implies a narrative that comes from the bottom up**.]{.underline}8
Finally, with the hyphen that places a distinction between remember and
re-member[, I also call attention to members that re-form part of a
community and re-shape their own diasporic identity.]{.underline} I
emphasize the voices of those who are marginalized and asking for
visibility and true citizenship, asking to become members of a national
community again, to be re-membered. Each text is written from their
point of view. **[The texts affirm their agency, and "re-member" their
traumas into the community's body.]{.underline}** [**It is a common
struggle against discrimination and toward agency that binds the works
together**.]{.underline} Each text is bound to questions of race,
socio-economic marginalization, and gender. Each text conveys an active
"re-membering." Each text presents a retrieval and re-integration of
traumatic memories and physical afflictions into the characters' minds
and bodies, and into contemporary imaginaries. Rape, infanticide,
personal and collective abuse, social injustice, each scenario recalls
the insurmountable moments of suffering that affect women of color in
the Hemispheric Americas. [At the same time, each narrative underlines
the value of story telling and corporal expression. Each **narrative
teaches us to transform suffering into a shared witnessing and a
constructive experience**.]{.underline} The literary texts that make up
my corpus fit into discourse of resistance. They speak against canonical
and patriarchical discourses. They voice their own self-definitions
against a master text. What master texts are they struggling against?
Which feminist discourse do they fit into, specifically? Feminist
literary criticism considers that the first challenge women writers face
is their repressed presence within literary history. The gaps within
literary history create an "anxiety of influence" (Gilbert & Gubar 25).
Women authors look for female predecessors, yet the literary texts that
make up my corpus fit into discourse of resistance. They speak against
canonical and patriarchical discourses. They voice their own
self-definitions against a master text. What master texts are they
struggling against? Which feminist discourse do they fit into,
specifically? Feminist literary criticism considers that the first
challenge women writers face is their repressed presence within literary
history. The gaps within literary history create an "anxiety of
influence" (Gilbert & Gubar 25). Women authors look for female
predecessors, yet these precursos have been cast as alienated by madness
before the 20th century, or defined as inferior writers. So they write
about being limited by texts that have entrapped them in perpetual seams
of "appropriate" behavior (ibid 26). The writers studied in this
dissertation illustrate the same textual acts of survival. They inscribe
their own identity within discourses that resist the patriarchal
hegemony. The texts I chose for my study share a struggle against
patriarchal hegemony, but they speak from diverse geographical
locations, and tell very different stories. [T**his project stores an
archive of works that narrate disparate historical and personal trauma
to present women and youth of color as heterogeneous
identities**]{.underline}**.** [The geographical disparity demonstrates
how regardless of geographical location, narratives re-member trauma
into various national imaginaries and discourses that have excluded
them.]{.underline} The narratives describe and contribute to distinct
but not incompatible contexts. They are all literary and performance
narratives produced between 1985 and 2005, years that make up the
context of Black and Third World Feminism's hemispheric boom in the
United States, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Brazil, among other places.
These are also crucial years in terms of the birth and growth of hip hop
in the United States, and the birth and growth of global hip-hop. In
some instances, the works surfaced into the public sphere almost
synchronously. Toni Morrison's Beloved and Maryse Condé's I, Tituba,
Black Witch of Salem, were published two years apart, in 1985 and 1987,
in the United States and France.9 Gloria Anzaldúa's Borderlands/La
frontera: The New Mestiza Consciousness came out shortly after Toni
Morrison's Beloved, the same year that Tituba reached the United States'
audience, in 1987.10 Reyita: sencillamente, testimonio de una negra
cubana nonagenaria, was originally published in Spanish (1996) and
translated into English in 2000. In the early 1990s, the youths of Holly
Watts were creating new dances, Clowning and Krump (1992), and a handful
of young Rio de Janeiro inhabitants were starting the cultural group for
favela youths "Afro Reggae" (1993).11 The documentaries that projected
each movement onto the big screen, RIZE (David LaChapelle) and Favela
Rising (Matt Mochary and Jeff Zimbalist) both premiered in 2005. Ponciá
Vicencio, by Conceição Evaristo, was published in São Paolo in 2003 and
translated into English in 2007. Of the poems and short stories written
by female members of the Quilombhoje group, a writers' collective born
in 1978, I selected works taken from the collective's yearly publication
Cadernos Negros (Black Notebooks), published in the last 10 years. 
[Although each narrative deals with trauma from different eras and
geographical contexts, the writers and performers share common
objectives, which make up for their disparity and diverse geographical
locations. **First and foremost, each narrative brings down a heavy
curtain of misrepresentation or invisibility, climbs up the steps from a
marginalized past, steps out from the backstage of History and onto the
center stage of their stories**. ]{.underline} Whether performative or
literary (novel, essay, testimonio or poetry), each narrative uncovers
the story of a marginalized individual wrapped in a post-colonial
rhetoric. Toni Morrison, Conceição Evaristo and Maryse Condé's novels
relate U.S. American, Brazilian and French Caribbean stories that
rewrite their respective precursors' slave narratives with neo
abolitionist novels centered on women. María de los Reyes Castillo's
testimony, "the only testimony of a former Cuban slave woman" includes
her interpretation of Cuban history to recall women of African descent's
role in the foundation of the Cuban nation (Duke 16).12 Krump, Clowning
and AfroReggae choreograph another identity for youth of color in
HollyWatts and Rio de Janeiro. They echo Jamaican slums' rebellious
reggae music and East Coast and West Coast revolutionary elements of hip
hop.13 Gloria Anzaldúa reminds her readers of U.S. Hispanic people's
history and their deities' histories. She formulates a new "mestiza"
consciousness at the borders of the United States and Mexico, in between
sexual identities, floating among different languages. Each text fights
against historical amnesia to re-member traumas into contemporary
memory. [Another connection between the works' diverse loci of
enunciation is how **they** **re-work identities and body
image**]{.underline}. [Each character, narrator, poetic voice, author or
performer, depending  on the genre, **finds** her **body to reflect a
site of fragmentation, due to traumas or other
afflictions**.]{.underline} The body image conveys gaps that are
necessary to be discovered in order to fashion a woman of   color and a
youth of color identity. I would not generalize this phenomenon to be
recurring for all women and youth of color; it presents itself in the
works that I intend to study. [The past traumas that each work deals
with]{.underline} (infanticide, rape, lynching, racial discrimination in
the household, community massacre, riots, domestic abuse) [connote a

# TRANS UNDERCOMMONS

#### Whiteness through behaviors, action, and orientations has laid the groundwork of cisheteronormativity -- an ideal subjectivity that those touched by whiteness must occupy. "You are the gender that Whiteness has assigned you at birth," Whiteness proclaims while reacting violently to those that do not fit into a white, nuclear family model.

#### To be cis is to be first chair violin in the symphony orchestra of the white nuclear family -- playing the correct, legible series of notes in the whiteness philharmonic. Cis people play their parts in the perfectly scripted, white opus of cisheteropatriarchy -- embodying reproductivity, purity, and the proper white subject. Whiteness taught its disciples how to tread down and destroy the queer -- it teaches cishet men that they're the victim of perverse con by a trans woman who dared try seducing him before checking her own ability to conform to whiteness. When a cishet man kills a trans woman, this man has not committed murder -- for she is not a woman. She is a nothing, an abject -- an object for men to jerk off to like a porno but not to love or respect -- or selectively a subject to be punished and disciplined by the police.

#### If the white nuclear family is the script, then trans people are the thespian traitors that deserve the policing -- cishet "allies" say "trans rights" like it validates their performance; yet, in the twilight hours between consciousness and sleep they still whisper to themselves, "but are tr\*ps gay though?" Trans people should've just kept it to themselves, just be steal and present normal -- maybe then maybe the whiteness enforcement agency wouldn't need to rectify your presentation.

#### Whiteness is a weapon, exported globally as an arm of American racial terrorism but trans people are the imperfect performance of whiteness. Failure to comply with scripts of nuclear family structures that are part and parcel with Whiteness means that trans people are essentially renegade arms in need of capture and disarmament.

I had an interesting conversation with TJ last night about a very
challenging post on his site titled, bluntly, "[There are no 'good white
people]{.underline}.'" TJ is wrestling here with how [[the
American]{.mark} (and European) [concept of "whiteness"]{.mark} and the
national environment of white-supremacy [distorts all of
us]{.mark}]{.underline} (white people and PoC) [as individuals [and
pollutes the relationships we have with one
another]{.mark}]{.underline}. He concisely brings out the real,
devastating and (for the foreseeable future) inescapable consequences of
the fiction of race--the social reality of the invented category--and he
points out the privileged asymmetry through which people marked as white
can pretend to escape white-supremacy (this is the other side of the
burden of knowledge that Baldwin and Coates elegantly describe). I
encourage you to read TJ's post in its entirety, but I will quote the
opening here: Sometimes I wonder if white people know what a constant
state of grace and forbearance they get from people of color every day.
I think so many white folk like to imagine that they're the "good ones,"
that they don't do fucked up or racist things, and that they're not bad
and wouldn't seek to marginalize or hurt POC ever. But honestly, we live
in a society where things are tilted for you every damn day. At any
point, any of you can turn on us. Lovers, friends, family, colleagues.
Any of you. [As TJ and I discussed yesterday, this is,]{.underline} in
some ways, [a statement of our general human condition]{.underline}:
goodness isn't a location you can arrive at or an object you can come to
possess. Goodness is an active principle, and you are only ever as good
as your present actions. Hannah Arendt describes human qualities like
goodness, courage, etc. as "virtues" in Machiavelli's sense of virtue:
goodness (etc.) is an action performed among other human beings, and you
are only good when you are giving a virtuosic performance. Jay Smooth
puts it more simply: being good (being anti-racist, for instance) is
like brushing your teeth; you have to do it every day. Going back to
TJ's terminology, [there are no good white people because you have to
perform your role as an ally every day. You never arrive at the point
where you don't have to think about it or where you can be a little bit
racist because you earned your "good white person" badge]{.underline}.
The reality of that continuous responsibility comes through with painful
clarity in TJ's point that "[At any point, any of you can
turn]{.underline} on us." If you think being constantly on your toes as
a white ally sounds demanding, [imagine being a person of color who can
be betrayed by allies and intimates at any moment.]{.underline} If white
allies live under a constant moral imperative, people of color live
under a constant threat of injury that could arrive without warning from
any direction. **[[White supremacy is racial
terrorism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, even in its most genteel forms; [[it
shapes lives through the threat of violence, even when things appear
calm]{.mark}.]{.underline} [As white allies, we have to recognize that
**[whiteness is a weapon]{.mark}.** We are born with this weapon, we
cannot put it down, and we injure people with it]{.underline} when we
forget it is in our hands. [The national (and [international) structures
of white supremacy gave us these weapons]{.mark} to use for our own
benefit]{.underline}. [It designed the weapon of whiteness
to]{.underline} hobble people of color and [give us an advantage over
them in life.]{.underline} [[**It designed its weapon to** exploit,
control and **destroy black bodies for the benefit of white
people**]{.underline}]{.mark}. We can renounce those designs and live
our lives against the grain of white supremacy, but--and this is a
tragedy for everyone involved--[[as long as we live]{.mark} within an
environment structured by white supremacy, [we cannot put the weapon
down]{.mark}.]{.underline} We cannot put it down because we are the
weapon: [[the structure of white supremacy engraves whiteness into our
bodies, and we cannot escape our bodies]{.mark}.]{.underline} [We live
within/as the weapon of whiteness.]{.underline} We do not have to use
our whiteness to attack others, but, even when we do not use it to
intentionally, whiteness threatens to wound those around us the moment
we get careless. Worse than that, [the weapon of whiteness is a threat
even when we are mindful and careful and conscientious]{.underline}. It
is a threat because, as TJ points out, any one of us can turn on our
friends, family, lovers, etc. at any moment, even if we don't mean to do
it. [No degree of enlightenment or number of good deeds will sheath the
blade of our whiteness or make it incapable of injuring
others.]{.underline} Because we carry and will always carry this
destructive weapon with us, we must dedicate ourselves to mindfulness,
to care, and to gratitude for the grace and forbearance we receive from
the PoC who stay with us knowing that we will hurt them. (As TJ and I
discussed last night, a similar structure also applies to relationships
between men and women in partriarchal environments, to cis-gendered
people in transphobic environments, etc.)

#### I'm sorry father, I'm sorry I can't act like a boy my age ought to act. But who is there to support me, where do I go when my own soul revolts against my flesh to such an extent that it burns beneath my skin and makes me crave a release of my essence from its corporeal prison. Yet this is one incarceration that does not end when we transition. We develop an eye for anything that makes us clockable and foreclose any future where we feel secure that we pass -- not like passing would complete our embodiment of whiteness anyway. If my myopic ass can see every little thing that makes me a man, can't cisnormativity clock me too?

#### To be trans is to be trapped between insufferable self-loathing and insurmountable structures of anti-queerness that make my existence, non-existent. To exist in this space, I need a divine intervention, or at the very least some fucking expression.

#### Therefore...

#### We travel to where the wild things are where we don't understand the wild things and the wild things don't understand us. We promise not to eat the wild things and the wild things promise not to eat us. But one day we must leave where the wild things are and the wild things will leave where the wild things are and we will find new places to make "where the wild things are". In those places where the wild things are, we will come together again and promise not to eat each other again. And we will keep finding new places where the wild things are.

#### We retreat from the whiteness that has marked my body as not deserving of existence and rather deserving of reconstructive violence. Thus we change our orientation from the orientations that comprise whiteness to the orientation of the Undercommons. We become fugitives to the White space of the commons and instead find refuge in the Undercommon orientation to resist touching by whiteness and to resist the orientation of whiteness that demands violence against me.

**Page 12** For Fred Moten and Stefano Harney, [we must make common
cause with those desires and (non) positions that seem crazy and
unimaginable: [we must]{.mark}, on behalf of this alignment, [refuse
that which was first refused to us and]{.mark} in this refusal reshape
desire, reorient hope, [reimagine possibility and do so separate from
the fantasies nestled into rights and
respectability]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Instead, our fantasies
must come from what Moten and Harney citing Frank B. Wilderson III call
"the hold": "And so it is we remain in the hold, in the break, as if
entering again and again the broken world, to trace the visionary
company and join it." The hold here is the hold in the slave ship but it
is also the hold that we have on reality and fantasy, the hold they have
on us and the hold we decide to forego on the other, preferring instead
to touch, to be with, to love. If there is no church in the wild, [if
there is study rather than knowledge production, [if there is a way of
being together in brokenness]{.mark}, if there is an undercommons, then
[we must all find our way to it.]{.mark} And it will not be there where
the wild things are, [it will be a place where refuge is not necessary
and you will find that you were already in it all
along]{.mark}.]{.underline} Moten and Harney also study what it would
mean to refuse what they term "the call to order." And what would it
mean, furthermore, [[to refuse to call others to order]{.mark}, to
refuse interpellation and the re-instantiation of the law. When we
refuse, Moten and Harney suggest, we create dissonance and more
importantly, we allow dissonance to continue -- when we enter a
classroom and we refuse to call it to order, we are allowing study to
continue, dissonant study perhaps, disorganized study, but study that
precedes our call and will continue after we have left the room. Or,
[when we listen to music, we must refuse the idea that music happens
only when the musician enters and picks up an instrument; music is also
the anticipation of the performance and the noises of appreciation it
generates and the speaking that happens through and around it, making it
and loving it, being in it while listening]{.mark}. And so, [when we
refuse the call to order]{.mark} -- the teacher picking up the book, the
conductor raising his baton, the speaker asking for silence, the
torturer tightening the noose -- [we refuse order as the distinction
between noise and music, chatter and knowledge, pain and
truth.]{.mark}]{.underline} These kinds of examples get to the heart of
Moten and Harney's world of the undercommons -- [the undercommons is not
a realm where we rebel, and we create critique; it is not a place where
we "take arms against a sea of troubles/and by opposing end them." [The
undercommons is a space and time which is always here. Our goal]{.mark}
-- and the "we" is always the right mode of address here -- [is not to
end the troubles but to end the world that created those particular
troubles as the ones that must be opposed.]{.mark}]{.underline} Moten
and Harney refuse the logic that stages refusal as inactivity, as the
absence of a plan and as a mode of stalling real politics. [Moten and
Harney tell us to listen to the noise we make and to refuse the offers
we receive to shape that noise into "music." In the essay that many
people already know best from this volume, "The University and the
Undercommons,"]{.underline} Moten and Harney come closest to explaining
their mission. Refusing to be for or against the university and in fact
marking the critical academic as the player who holds the "for and
against" logic in place, Moten and Harney lead us to the "Undercommons
of the Enlightenment" where subversive intellectuals engage both the
university and fugitivity: "where the work gets done, where the work
gets subverted, where the revolution is still black, still strong." [The
subversive intellectual, we learn, is unprofessional, uncollegial,
passionate and disloyal. The subversive intellectual is neither trying
to extend the university nor change the university, the subversive
intellectual is not toiling in misery and from this place of misery
articulating a "general antagonism." In fact, the subversive
intellectual enjoys the ride and wants it to be faster and wilder; she
does not want a room of his or her own, she wants to be in the world, in
the world with others and making the world anew.]{.underline} Moten
insists: "Like Deleuze. I believe in the world and want to be in it. I
want to be in it all the way to the end of it because I believe in
another world in the world and I want to be in that. And I plan to stay
a believer, like Curtis Mayfield. But that's beyond me, and even beyond
me and Stefano, and out into the world, the other thing, the other
world, the joyful noise of the scattered, scatted eschaton, the
undercommon re-fusal of the academy of misery." **Page 7** Moten and
Harney want to gesture to another place, [a wild place that is not
simply the left-over space that limns real and regulated zones of polite
society; rather[, it is a wild place that continuously produces its own
unregulated wildness]{.mark}. The zone we enter through Moten and Harney
is ongoing and exists in the present and, as Harney puts it, "some kind
of demand was already being enacted, fulfilled in the call
itself."]{.underline} While describing the London Riots of 2011, Harney
suggests that the [riots and insurrections do not separate out "the
request, the demand and the call" -- rather, they enact the one in the
other: "I think the call, in the way I would understand it[, the
call,]{.mark} as in the call and response[, the response is already
there before the call goes out.]{.mark} You're already in something."
You are already in it. For Moten too, [you are always already in the
thing that you call for and that calls you]{.mark}. What's more, [the
call is always a call to dis-order]{.mark} and this disorder or
wild-ness shows up in many places: in jazz, in improvisation, in noise.
The disordered sounds that we refer to as cacophony will always be cast
as "extra-musical," as Moten puts it, precisely because we hear
some-thing in them that reminds us that our desire for harmony is
arbitrary and in another world, harmony would sound incomprehensible.
[Lis-tening to cacophony and noise tells us that there is a wild beyond
to the structures we inhabit and that inhabit us.]{.mark} And [when we
are called to this other place]{.mark}, the wild beyond, "beyond the
beyond" in Moten and Harney's apt terminology, we have to give ourselves
over to a certain kind of craziness.]{.underline} Moten reminds us that
even as Fanon took an anti-colonial stance, he knew that it "looks
cra-zy" but, Fanon, as a psychiatrist, also knew not to accept this
organic division between the rational and the crazy and he knew that it
would be crazy for him not to take that stance in a world that had
assigned to him the role of the unreal, the primitive and the wild.
Fanon, ac-cording to Moten, wants not the end of colonialism but the end
of the standpoint from which colonialism makes sense. [In order to bring
colonialism to an end then, one does not speak truth to power, one has
to inhabit the crazy, nonsensical, ranting language of the other, the
other who has been rendered a nonentity by colonialism. Indeed,
blackness, for Moten and Harney by way of Fanon, is the willingness to
be in the space that has been abandoned by colonialism, by rule, by
order. Moten takes us there, saying of Fanon finally: "Eventually, I
believe, he comes to believe in the world, which is to say the other
world, where we inhabit and maybe even cultivate this absence, this
place which shows up here and now, in the sovereign's space and time, as
absence, darkness, death, things which are not]{.underline} (as John
Donne would say)." **Page 11** Like all world-making and all
world-shattering encounters, [when you enter this book and learn how to
be with and for, in coalition, and on the way to the place we are
already making, you will also feel fear, trepidation, concern, and
disorientation. The disorientation]{.underline}, Moten and Harney will
tell you is not just unfortunate, it [is necessary be-cause you will no
longer be in one location moving forward to another, instead you will
already be part of "the "movement of things" and on the way to this
"outlawed social life of nothing."]{.underline} The movement of things
can be felt a nd touched and exists in language and in fantasy, it is
flight, it is motion, it is fugitivity itself. Fugitivity is not only
es-cape, "exit" as Paolo Virno might put it, or "exodus" in the terms
offered by Hardt and Negri, fugitivity is being separate from settling.
It is a being in motion that has learned that "organizations are
obstacles to organizing ourselves" (The Invisible Committee in The
Coming Insurrection) and that there are spaces and modalities that exist
separate from the logical, logistical, the housed and the positioned.
Moten and Harney call this mode a "being together in homelessness" which
does not idealize homelessness nor merely metaphorize it. Homeless-ness
is the state of dispossession that we seek and that we embrace: "Can
this being together in homelessness, this interplay of the refusal of
what has been refused, this undercommon appositionality, be a place from
which emerges neither self-consciousness nor knowledge of the other but
an improvisation that proceeds from somewhere on the other side of an
unasked question?" I think this is what Jay-Z and Kanye West (another
collaborative unit of study) call "no church in the wild." **Page 5**
[It ends with love, exchange, fellowship. It ends as it begins, in
motion, in between various modes of being and belonging, and on the way
to new economies of giving, taking, being with and for and it ends with
a ride in a Buick Skylark on the way to another place altogether.
Sur-prising, perhaps, after we have engaged dispossession, debt,
disloca-tion and violence. But not surprising when you have understood
that the projects of "fugitive planning and black study" are mostly
about reaching out to find connection; they are about making common
cause with the brokenness of being, a brokenness, I would venture to
say, that is also blackness, that remains blackness, and will, despite
all, remain broken because this book is not a prescription for repair.
If we do not seek to fix what has been broken, then what? [How do we
re-solve to live with brokenness, with being broke,]{.mark} which is
also what Moten and Harney call "debt." Well, given that [debt is
sometimes a history of giving]{.mark}, at other times [a history of
taking]{.mark}, at all times [a history of capitalism]{.mark} and given
that [debt also signifies a promise of ownership but never deliv-ers on
that promise,]{.mark} we have to understand that debt is something that
cannot be paid off. Debt, as Harney puts it, presumes a kind of
individu-alized relation to a naturalized economy that is predicated
upon exploi-tation. Can we have, he asks, another sense of what is owed
that does not presume a nexus of activities like recognition and
acknowledge-ment, payment and gratitude. Can debt "become a principle of
elaboration"? Moten links economic debt to the brokenness of being in
the in-terview with Stevphen Shukaitis; he acknowledges that some debts
should be paid, and that much is owed especially to black people by
white people, and yet, he says: "I also know that [what]{.mark} it is
that [is supposed to be repaired is irreparable]{.mark}. It can't be
repaired. [The only thing we can do is tear this shit down completely
and build some-thing new." The undercommons do not come to pay their
debts, to repair what has been broken, to fix what has come
undone.]{.mark} If you want to know what the undercommons wants, what
Moten and Harney want, what black people, indigenous peoples, queers and
poor people want, what we (the "we" who cohabit in the space of the
undercommons) want, it is this -- [we cannot be satisfied with the
recognition and acknowledgement generated by the very system that denies
a) that anything was ever broken and b) that we deserved to be the
broken part; so we refuse to ask for recognition and instead we want to
take apart, dismantle, tear down the structure that, right now, **limits
our ability to find each other, to see beyond it and to access the
places that we know lie outside its walls**.]{.mark} We cannot say what
new structures will replace the ones we live with yet, because once we
have torn shit down, [we will inevitably see more and see differently
and feel a new sense of wanting and being and
becoming.]{.mark}]{.underline} What we want after "the break" will be
different from what we think we want before the break and both are
necessarily different from the desire that issues from being in the
break. Let's come at this by another path. In the melancholic and
visionary 2009 film version of Maurice Sandak's Where The Wild Things
Are(1963), Max, the small seeker who leaves his room, his home, his
family to find the wild beyond, finds a world of lost and lonely beasts
and they promptly make him their king. Max is the first king the wild
things have had whom they did not eat and who did not, in turn, try to
eat them; and the beasts are the first grown things that Max has met who
want his opinion, his judgment, his rule. [Max's power is that he is
small while they are big; he promises the beasts that he has no plans to
eat them and this is more than anyone has ever promised them. He
promises that he will find ways through and around and will "slip
through cracks" and re-crack the cracks if they fill up.]{.underline} He
promises to keep sadness at bay and to make a world with the wild
creatures that "roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible
teeth and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws."
[[That Max fails to make the wild things happy or to save them or to
make a world with them is less important than the fact that he found
them and he recognized in them the end of something and potentially the
path to an alternative to his world.]{.mark} The wild things were not
the utopian creatures of fairy tales, they were the rejected and lost
subjects of the world Max had left behind and, because he shut-tles
between the Oedipal land where his mother rules and the ruined world of
the wild, he knows the parameters of the real -- he sees what is
included and what is left out and he is now able to set sail for
an-other place, a place that is neither the home he left nor the home to
which he wants to return.]{.underline} **Page 10** [The mission then for
the denizens of the undercommons is to recognize that when you seek to
make things better, you are not just doing it for the Other, you must
also be doing it for yourself.]{.underline} While men may think they are
being "sensitive" by turning to feminism, while white people may think
they are being right on by opposing racism, no one will really be able
to embrace the mission of tearing "this shit down" until they realize
that the structures they oppose are not only bad for some of us, they
are bad for all of us. Gender hierarchies are bad for men as well as
women and they are really bad for the rest of us. [Racial hierarchies
are not rational and ordered, they are chaotic and nonsensical and must
be opposed by precisely all those who benefit in any way from them. Or,
as Moten puts it: "The coalition emerges out of your recognition that
it's fucked up for you, in the same way that we've already recognized
that it's fucked up for us. I don't need your help. I just need you to
recognize that this shit is killing you, too, however much more softly,
you stupid motherfucker, you know?" The coalition unites us in the
recognition that we must change things or die. All of us. We must all
change the things that are fucked up and change cannot come in the form
that we think of as "revolutionary" -- not as a masculinist surge or an
armed confrontation. Revolution will come in a form we cannot yet
imagine. Moten and Harney pro-pose that we prepare now for what will
come by entering into study. Study, a mode of thinking with others
separate from the thinking that the institution requires of you,
prepares us to be embedded in what Harney calls "the with and for" and
allows you to spend less time antagonized and antagonizing.]{.underline}

#### The apocalyse has already happened and we are living in its destructive wake---the whitefamilyocene, through ravaging conquest, settlement, and slavery in Americas in the name of white reproduction, has already created mass extinction(s) of black, indigenous and queer families and life formations. To think the question of extinction begs a question about life---what lives can we live under the whitefamilyocene, and are such lives free from death?

#### We free ourselves from the deaths we are scripted to live by defying the ineffable plan of the white nuclear family. Through our undercommon understanding between ourselves and other queer people we reject the organization of the commons. Organization is the weapon against our bodies -- organization is the reason that trans people are treated as abject and why the rate of attempted suicide amongst trans youth is 41.8%. \<Do we successfully defy the scripts of life or the scripts of death?\>

#### As debaters we re-orient to the orientation of the Undercommons. The existential terror of trans-ness has taught me exactly what the commons is about -- violence against my body for not performing the scripts of white cisness to a sufficiently acceptable standard. My queerness is an injunction -- the way my body and my soul break with the expectations of the commons and how that scripts my relations to other people is the orientation of the Undercommons.

#### And thus, we refuse the call to order.

Sydney University, "Progress in Human Geography" ,
[https://doi.org/10.1177/0309132508090821](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0309132508090821)

As graduate students in the 1970s, we were schooled to see social
scientific work as a political intervention. Joining with other eco-
nomic geographers to theorize capitalist restructuring -- the current
hot topic -- we focused on the nature and dynamics of a globalizing
economy, with the goal of 'under- standing the world in order to change
it'. This familiar Marxist prescription turned out to be difficult to
follow, especially when it came to changing the world; [our
understandings seemed to cement an emerging world in place rather than
readying it for transformation.]{.underline} But when we encountered
poststructural- ism in the late 1980s, our interventionist view of
social knowledge was re-energized. [Untethered from the obligation to
represent what was 'really going on out there', we began to ask how
theory and epistemology could advance what we wanted to do in the
world.]{.underline} Tentatively at first, [we dropped our structural
approach to social explanation and adopted an anti-essentialist
approach, theorizing the contingency of social out- comes rather than
the unfolding of structural logics]{.underline}. This gave us (and the
world) more room to move, enlarging the space of the ethical and
political (Laclau and Mouffe, 1985). At the same time, we embraced a
performative orientation to knowledge rather than a realist or
reflective one. This acknow- ledged the activism inherent in knowledge
production and installed a new kind of scholarly responsibility (Butler,
1993; Law and Urry, 2004; Callon, 2005). 'How can our work open up
possibilities?' 'What kind of world do we want to participate in
building?' 'What might be the effect of theorizing things this way
rather than that?' These became the guiding questions of our research
practice. Our goal as academics was still to under- stand the world in
order to change it, but with a poststructuralist twist -- to change our
understanding is to change the world, in small and sometimes major ways
(Law and Urry, 2004: 391). [Our specific goal was to produce a discourse
of economic difference as a contribution to a politics of economic
innovation (Healy, 2008a). But, before we could embark on a project of
theorizing eco- nomic diversity, we had to confront the understandings
of capitalism that stood in the way]{.underline}. In The end of
capitalism we addressed [familiar representations of capitalism as an
obdurate structure or system, coextensive with the social space. We
argued that **the performative effect of these representations was to
dampen and discourage non-capitalist initiatives, since power was
assumed to be concentrated in capitalism and to be largely absent from
other forms of economy**. In the vicinity of such representations, those
who might be interested in non-capitalist economic projects pulled back
from ambi- tions of widespread success -- their dreams seemed
unrealizable, at least in our life- times.]{.underline} **[Thus
capitalism was strengthened, its dominance performed, as an effect of
its representations.]{.underline}** As a means of dislocating the
hegemonic framing of capitalism, we adopted the entry point of class and
specified, following Marx and Resnick and Wolff (1987), a number of
class processes (independent, feudal, slave, communal and capitalist).
Alongside these co-existing ways of producing, appropriating, and
distributing surplus in its many forms, capitalism became slightly less
formidable. **[Without its systemic embodiment, it ap- peared more like
its less well-known siblings, as a set of practices scattered over a
land- scape -- in families, neighborhoods, house- holds, organizations,
states, and private, public and social enterprises. Its dominance in any
time or place became an open question rather than an initial
presumption]{.underline}**. From the outset, feminist economic analysis
provided support and raw materials for the emerging vision of a diverse
economic field. Over the past 20 years, feminist analysts have
demonstrated that **[non-market transactions and unpaid household work
(both by definition non-capitalist) constitute 30--50% of economic
activity in both rich and poor countries]{.underline}** (Ironmonger,
1996).1 **[Such quantitative representations exposed the discursive
violence entailed in speaking of 'capitalist' economies, and lent
credibility to projects of representing economy
differently]{.underline}**. Since the publication of The end of
capitalism, we have been less concerned with disrupting the performative
effects of capitalist representation, and [more con- cerned with putting
forward a new economic ontology that could contribute to novel economic
performances]{.underline}. Broadening out from Marxism and feminism, we
began to repopulate the economic landscape as a proliferative space of
difference, drawing eclectically on economic anthropology, economic
sociology, institutional economics, area studies, and studies of the
underground and informal economies. We were buoyed in our efforts by the
growing interest, among geographers and others[, in representing and
documenting the huge variety of economic transactions, labor practices
and economic organizations that contribute to social well-being
worldwide,]{.underline} in both positive and unsavory ways. The diverse
economies framing in Figure 1 groups a sampling of this variety into
three columns -- [transactions (including all the market, alternative
market and non-market transactions that circulate goods and services),
labor (including wage labor, alternatively compensated labor and unpaid
labor) and enterprise (including all the non-capitalist and capitalist
enterprises that produce, appropriate and distribute surplus in
different ways).]{.underline} This framing is an open-ended work in
progress and could potentially include other columns indicating the
plurality of private and common property forms or other dimensions of
difference such as relationships to nature or forms of finance. When
specified for any particular locality or sector, the entries in the
boxes will vary (often widely) from those shown here.2 Figure 1 is of
course susceptible to a number of different readings. Those working with
a structural ontology, for example, might construe the lower cells as
subordinate or complementary to capitalism, which seems to be in a
position of dominance in the top line. To an ethical and performative
reading, on the other hand, the diagram is not a window on a
transcendent ontology but simply one technology for performing a dif-
ferent economy, bringing into visibility a diversity of economic
activities as objects of inquiry and activism. The familiar binaries are
present but they are in the process of being deconstructed. In this
reading, **[the diverse economies research program is a perform- ative
ontological project -- part of bringing new economies into being --
rather than a realist epistemological project of capturing and assessing
existing objects]{.underline}**. **[Our research has begun performing
dif- ferent economies by specifying this diagram for particular sectors
and regions, using it as an imaginative starting place for brain-
storming and building 'other economies'.]{.underline}** But our action
research projects (like our other academic efforts) face the challenge
of credibility. While people have little trouble accepting that all
these activities and organ- izations exist, it is harder to believe they
have any real or potential consequence. They are seldom seen as a source
of dynamism, or as the so-called driver or motor of change (except as
fuel for capitalist development). What is intriguing, however, is that
'**[marginal' economic practices and forms of enterprise are actually
more prevalent, and account for more hours worked and/or more value
produced, than the capitalist sector. Most of them are globally
extensive, and potentially have more impact on social well-being than
capitalism does]{.underline}** -- though the latter claim is
speculative, unlike the quantitative assertion above. In the absence of
studies to support this claim, we offer a brief and selective inven-
tory of globally local activities to convey something of their magnitude
and effectivity.

#### We should instead turn to practicing weak theory, rejecting typical closed notions of critical thought and instead creating a welcoming environment for possible new objects of thought.

We are arguing that the diverse economy framing opens up opportunities
for elaborating a radically heterogeneous economy and theorizing
economic dynamics that foster and strengthen different economies. It
also provides a representation of an existing economic world waiting to
be selectively (re)performed. But a problem remains -- it seems that we
need to become new academic subjects to be able to perform it[. **At
present we are trained to be discerning, detached and critical so that
we can penetrate the veil of common understanding and expose the root
causes and bottom lines that govern the phenomenal world. This academic
stance means that most theorizing is tinged with skepticism and
negativity, not a particularly nurturing environment for hope- ful,
inchoate experiments.**]{.underline} Bruno Latour expresses a similar
disquiet when he likens the practice of critical theory to the thinking
of popular conspiracy theorists: In both cases \... it is the same
appeal to power- ful agents hidden in the dark acting always
consistently, continuously, relentlessly. Of course, we in the academy
like to use more elevated causes -- society, discourse, know-
ledge-slash-power, fields of forces, empires, capitalism -- while
conspiracists like to portray a miserable bunch of greedy people with
dark intents, but I find something troublingly similar in the structure
of explanation, in the first movement of disbelief and, then, in the
wheeling of causal explanations coming out of the deep dark below.
(Latour, 2004: 229) In more psychoanalytic language, Eve Sedgwick
identifies this as the paranoid motive in social theorizing. She tells
the story of Freud, who observed a distressing affinity between his own
theorizing and the thinking of his paranoid patients. [Paranoia marshals
every site and event into the same fearful order, with the goal of
minimizing sur- prise]{.underline} (Sedgwick, 2003). **[Everything comes
to mean the same thing, usually something large and threatening (like
neoliberalism, or globalization, or capitalism, or
empire).]{.underline}** The paranoid stance yields a particular kind of
theory, 'strong' theory with an embracing reach and a reductive field of
meaning (Sedgwick, 2003). [**This means that experimental forays into
building new eco- nomies are likely to be dismissed as capital- ism in
another guise or as always already coopted; they are often judged as
inadequate before they are explored in all their com- plexity and
incoherence**.]{.underline} While such a reac- tion may be valid as the
appropriate critical response to new information, [it affirms an
ultimately essentialist, usually structural, vision of what is and
reinforces what is per- ceived as dominant.]{.underline} [**If our goal
as thinkers is the proliferation of different economies, we may need to
adopt a different orientation toward theory**.]{.underline} But the
question becomes how do we disinvest in our paranoid practices of
critique and mastery and undertake thinking that can energize and
support 'other economies'? Here we have turned to what Nietzsche called
self-artistry, and Foucault called self- cultivation, addressing them to
our own thinking. The co-implicated processes of changing
ourselves/changing our thinking/ changing the world are what we identify
as an ethical practice. If politics involves taking transformative
decisions in an undecideable terrain,5 ethics is the continual
exercising of a choice to be/act/or think in certain ways (Varela,
1992). How might those of us interested in diverse economies choose to
think and theorize in a way that makes us a condition of possibility of
new economic becomings, rather than a condition of their impossibility?
Once again Eve Sedgwick shows us the way. What if we were to accept that
the goal of theory is not to extend knowledge by confirming what we
already know, that the world is a place of domination and oppression?
What if we asked theory instead to help us see openings, to provide a
space of freedom and possibility? As a means of getting theory to yield
some- thing new, Sedgwick suggests reducing its reach, localizing its
purview, practicing a 'weak' form of theory.6 [**The practice of weak
theorizing involves refusing to extend ex- planation too widely or
deeply, refusing to know too much.** Weak theory could not know that
social experiments are doomed to fail or destined to reinforce
dominance; it could not tell us that the world economy will never be
transformed by the disorganized proliferation of local projects.
**Strong theory has produced our power- lessness by positing unfolding
logics and structures that limit politics. Weak theory could
de-exoticize power and help us accept it as our pervasive, uneven
milieu. We could begin to explore the many mundane forms of
power**]{.underline}. A differentiated landscape of force, constraint,
energy, and freedom would open up (Allen, 2003) and we could open
ourselves to the positive energies that are suddenly available. [Weak
theory could be undertaken with a reparative motive that welcomes
surprise, tolerates coexistence, and cares for the new, providing a
welcoming environment for the objects of our thought. It could foster a
'love of the world', as Hannah Arendt suggests,7 rather than masterful
knowing or moralistic detachment. It could draw on the pleasures of
friendliness, trust, and companionable connection. There could be a
greater scope for invention and playfulness, enchantment and
exuberance]{.underline} (Bennett, 2001).8 The diverse economies diagram
in Figure 1 provides an example of weak theory. It offers little more
than description, just the proliferation of categories and concepts. As
a listing of heterogeneous economic practices, it contains minimal
critical content; it is simply a technology that reconstitutes the
ground upon which we can perform a different economy, which is how we
have used it in our action research. **[The choice to create weak theory
about diverse economies is a political/ethical decision that influences
what kind of worlds we can imagine and create, ones in which we enact
and construct rather than resist (or succumb to) economic
realities.]{.underline}** Many other social scientists understand their
research choices as ordained by the world itself, by the stark realities
that impose themselves on consciousness and demand investigation. In
economic geography, for example, the dominant topic of research over the
past decade or more has been neoliberalism and neoliberal capitalist
globalization. This has been represented as needing study for the
apparently self-evident reason that 'it is the most important process of
our age, trans- forming geographies worldwide'. Some leading proponents
of neoliberalism studies have begun to express concern about where this
line of research is headed (Larner, 2003; Castree, 2006a), but few see
themselves as making an ethical choice to participate in con- stituting
neoliberalism. Law and Urry point to the ultimately destructive
'innocence' of this position: to the extent social science conceals its
per- formativity from itself it is pretending to an innocence that it
cannot have. And to the extent that it enacts methods that look for or
assume certain structural stabilities, it enacts those stabilities while
interfering with other realities \... (Law and Urry, 2004: 404, our
emphasis) Taking Law and Urry's point to heart, we can identify a
problem with strong theories of neoliberal globalization -- their
performative effect is to interfere with, to make non- credible (Santos,
2004), to deny legitimacy to the diverse economies that are already
here, and to close down the open futures that are waiting to be
performatively enacted. In the face of what has become 'normal science'
for economic geography -- studies of neoliberal this and that -- many
geographers are making other choices, contributing to new performances
by bringing economic diversity to light (see, for example, Leyshon et
al., 2003; Diverse Economies online bibliography, 2008). **[Through
devoting academic atten- tion to hidden and alternative economies they
have constituted new objects of study and investigation, making them
visible as potential objects of policy and politics. This is the most
basic sense in which knowledge is performative]{.underline}**. We would
imagine that not all of these people see themselves engaged in a per-
formative ontological politics -- such a politics is a potentiality we
are attempting to call into being. But all are contributing in some way
to making economic diversity more credible. They are resisting the
discursive erasure threatened by neoliberal theory, drawing attention to
and thereby strengthening a range of economic practices that exist out-
side the purview of neoliberal studies. In the rest of this paper, we
outline some of the practices of thinking and research that we and they
have adopted to advance the onto- logical project of 'diverse economies'

#### Their theorization that racialized identity is a manifestation of capitalism reproduces the very neoliberal structure they critique, because it negates forms of racial and gendered violence and it attempts to commodify those experiences as a reasons to participate in solidarity.

Cultural Studies, Goldsmiths College, University of London Posted on

[Feminism in neoliberal hands becomes just another form of career
progression: a way of moving "up," not by not recognising
ceilings]{.underline} (and walls) but [by assuming these
ceilings]{.underline} (and walls) [can disappear through individual
persistence]{.underline}. [And race equality]{.underline} also [has
neoliberal modes:]{.underline} say in the film Bend it like Beckham,
[when Jess moves "up" by putting the experience of racism behind her, as
if you will not be affected by racism when you are good enough
(]{.underline}for further discussion
see [here](https://feministkilljoys.com/2013/08/31/bend-it-happy-multiculturalism/)).
And note: [this rhetoric is similar to that used by anti-feminists and
racists]{.underline}: [those who say we talk about sexism and racism as
a way of not being responsible for the places we do not go; those who
say our investment in these very terms is how we excluded ourselves by
insisting on being excluded]{.underline}; those who say we should
just "get on with it" rather than "going on about it." [When race and
gender equality become neoliberal techniques they can become techniques
for concealing inequalities.]{.underline} Audre Lorde, who is with us
today through the words she left for us, gave us a strong critique of
neo-liberalism, even if she did not use that term. Her work is full of
insight into how structural inequalities are deflected by being made the
responsibility of individuals (who in being given the capacity to
overcome structures are assumed to fail when they do not overcome them).
Her work explores how self-care can become a technique of governance:
the duty to care for one's self often written as a duty to care for
one's own happiness, flourishing, well-being. Indeed, in The Cancer
Journals, Audre Lorde offers a powerful critique of how happiness
becomes a narrative of self-care. Faced with medical discourse that
attributes cancer to unhappiness and survival or coping to being happy
or optimistic she suggests: "looking on the bright side of things is a
euphemism used for obscuring certain realities of life, the open
consideration of which might prove threatening to the status quo" (1997:
76). To obscure or to take cover by looking on the bright side is to
avoid what might threaten the world as it is. Lorde moves from this
observation to a wider critique of happiness as an obscurant: "Let us
seek 'joy' rather than real food and clean air and a saner future on a
liveable earth! As if happiness alone can protect is from the results of
profit-madness" (76). Lorde suggests that the very idea that our first
responsibility is for our own happiness must be resisted by political
struggle, which means resisting the idea that our own resistance is a
failure to be responsible for happiness: "Was I really fighting the
spread of radiation, racism, woman-slaughter, chemical invasion and our
food, pollution of our environment, and the abuse and psychic
destruction of your young, merely to avoid dealing with my first and
greatest responsibility to be happy?" (76). I think Audre Lorde has
given us the answer to her question. And she offers us another answer in
her question: to assume your primary responsible is to your own
happiness might be how you end up not fighting against injustice. We
have something to work out here. Audre Lorde writes persuasively about
how self-care can become an obscurant, how caring for oneself can lead
you away from engaging in certain kinds of political struggle. And yet,
in A Burst of Light, she defends self-care as not about self-indulgence,
but self-preservation. Self-care becomes warfare. This kind of self-care
is not about one's own happiness. It is about finding ways to exist in a
world that is diminishing. Already: we have been given some tools to
sharpen our understanding of how neo-liberalism can be used as a tool.
There are differences that matter, differences that matter relating to
differences of power. [Neoliberalism sweeps up too much when all forms
of self-care become symptoms of neo-liberalism. When]{.underline}
feminist, queer and [anti-racist work that involves sharing our
feelings, our hurt and grief, recognising that power gets right to the
bone]{.underline}, [is called neo-liberalism]{.underline}, [we have to
hear what is not being heard.]{.underline} [When feminism involves
recognising the suffering of]{.underline} say, [an individual woman of
colour at the hands of a sexist, heterosexist, and racist
system]{.underline} [that is indifferent to the suffering it causes and
that is called neoliberalism, you would be repeating rather than
challenging this structural indifference]{.underline}. And [you also
negate other "other histories" that are at stake in her struggle for her
suffering to matter]{.underline}. [Those who do not have to struggle for
their own survival can]{.underline} very easily and rather [quickly
dismiss those who have to struggle for survival as "indulging
themselves]{.underline}." As feminism teaches us: [talking about
personal feelings is not necessarily about deflecting attention from
structures.]{.underline} If anything, I would argue the opposite: [not
addressing certain histories that hurt,]{.underline} histories that get
to the bone, [how we are affected by what we come up against, is one way
of deflecting attention from structures]{.underline} (as if our concern
with our own pain or suffering is what stops certain things from just
"going away"). Not the only way, but one way. If you have got a model
that says an individual woman who is trying to survive an experience of
rape by focusing on her own wellbeing and safety, by trying to work out
ways she can keep on going or ways she can participate in something
without having to experience more trauma (by asking for trigger warnings
in a classroom, for instance) is participating in the same politics as a
woman who is concerned with getting up "the ladder" in a company then I
think there is something wrong with your model. Sometimes, ["coping
with" or "getting by" or "making do" might appear as a way of not
attending to structural inequalities, as benefiting from a system by
adapting to it]{.underline}, even if you are not privileged by that
system, even if you are damaged by that system. Perhaps we need to
ask: who has enough resources not to have to become resourceful? When
you have less resources you might have to become more resourceful. Of
course: [the requirement to become more resourceful is part of the the
injustice of a system that distributes resources unequally.]{.underline}
Of course: becoming resourceful is not system changing even if it can
be life changing (although maybe, just maybe, a collective refusal not
to not exist can be system changing). [But to assume people's ordinary
ways of coping with injustices implies some sort of failure on their
part -- or even an identification with the system -- is another
injustice they have to cope with. The more resources you have the easier
it is to make such a critique of those whose response to injustice is to
become more resourceful]{.underline}. You might not be trying to move
up, to project yourself forward; you might simply be trying not to be
brought down. Heavy, heavy histories. Wearing, worn down.

STEFANO: Well, it's not that I'm less reticent. **[I'm less convinced
that there's a thing called the state, because I used to work in
it.]{.underline}** Okay, government and state are not the same thing,
but **[[I've never been able to understand the state except as an effect
of certain kinds of labor]{.mark}.]{.underline}** And, when I was
involved with that kind of labor, there were all kinds of undercommons
in the departments that I worked in. **[There was an underlabor. There
was study going on all the time in government.]{.underline}** And if
**[[government essentially produces effects of state in various
ways]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which seems to be what Tim Mitchell and
some of the smart- er guys around state theory think, then for me,
**[[it's not about being against or for the state, it's being
about]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as Tronti would say, **[[within and
against the state, but also with and for the undercommons of the
state]{.mark}.]{.underline}** So, I just don't line up on the side that
there's a state, there's an economy, there's a society, even that
there's state and capital in such a clear way. **[I have
a]{.underline}** much more, sort of, **[phenomenological]{.underline}**,
if I could use that word which I kind of hate, **[approach to the state.
When you get close to it, there's all kinds of shit going on there. Most
of it's bad. Most of the effects are bad]{.underline}**. But, at the
same time, **[some of the best study, some of the craziest undercommons
people have been working in government agencies, local government
agencies at the motor vehicle department.]{.underline}** I remember once
going in; I remember me and my friend Pete, we tried to get a cover for
*State Work*, my book about this stuff. We went into the big post office
that they later closed in downtown Manhat- tan. It was in the days when
the post office was just full of people actually working there, before
the attacks of September 11, 2001 in New York. I went to the one in
Durham very recently, actually, and it reminded me of what it used to be
like in New York, before it was all securitized. It was only a few
people but it was just like that: a big old post office. Everyone had
their booth, and i**[n lower Manhattan's post office behind almost every
booth was a black or latina woman who had completely decorated the booth
for herself. And it was full of, like, Mumia posters, pictures of kids,
pictures of Michael Jackson, pictures of union stuff, everything. Every
booth, so every time you went up, you got a different
view.]{.underline}** And I'm like, well, **[if these are the people who
are supposed to be making an effect called the state, then, there's got
to be an undercommons here too.]{.underline}** So, **[it's not helpful
for me to say I can do this and I will be invisible to the state won't
throw me in jail or doesn't throw people in jail all the time. I just
don't like to start from that position.]{.underline}** STEVPHEN: It
sounds more like projecting sort of an accidental fet- ish character of
the state that sees it as whole and coordinated and, of course, very
sensible. STEFANO: Yeah, and also, I think the fact that people work on
an af- fective state -- and there is a certain thing that goes on that
doesn't maybe go on in private production, because you have some notion
that you're producing the effect. Now, that's become more common
everywhere else. So, there's been a kind of way in which, well, there
used to be some idea that when you're working in productive indus- tries
you're producing stuff. Now of course everybody thinks they're producing
effects everywhere they're working. So, also, it seems to me that a
certain kind of distinction has broken down around that -- and I think
that's interesting. Also, I'm not against the production of ef- fects.
**[[I don't think that it's bad that people should get together and
imagine that they're producing something hard to see. It's just bad that
they happen to imagine nation-states]{.mark}.]{.underline}** I guess
that's my position on James Scott \[laughs\]. You know, I get enough
shit for attacking James Scott. I really never give the guy a thought! I
used to get criticised all the time when the *State Work* book came out,
from my development studies friends because apparently I called him "an
anti-communist," and that really made everybody berserk. But I just
meant in the technical sense that he was against communism. STEVPHEN: In
the technical sense! \[laughs\] FRED: I'm actually asking the question
now, because I want you to say something more, Stefano, about this,
because I actually think it's im- portant. For Scott, what is it that he
thinks he means by the state? Be- cause what you're saying, Stefano, is
that th**[ere's this monolithic thing that appears to be the referent
when people utter the word 'state.']{.underline}** And you're saying
it's not monolithic at all, and **[not only is it not a monolith but
it's very, very thoroughly aerated]{.underline}**. **[[There are all
kinds of little holes and tunnels and ditches and highways and byways
*through the state* that are being produced and maintained constantly by
the people who are also at the same time doing this labor that ends in
the production *of the state*]{.mark}.]{.underline}** So, what is it
that these folks are producing? Scott seems to refer to a monolith that
is unbroken by and in the very process of its construction. He's one of
the ones who gets us back to the point where we ask, **[what is it that
we don't like about that monolith. Well, its coercive power or its power
to police or its power to make policy or to foster the making of policy
or its power to govern or to foster governance and
governmentality.]{.underline}** So, what is he talking about? I give him
credit, or I believe, however anti-communist he is, I believe he's
sincere in his antipathy towards the monolith. T**[o the extent that it
exists, I hate it, too. But, then, there are other people on the left
who have no antipathy towards the state at all. And then I think they
mean, [it's not some sort of monolithic mode of existence that we are
all captured by and contained within at the level of our own a ective
relations to one another and our everyday
practices]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- because I think that's part of what
Scott means. But **[what they're basically saying is, "no, what I'm
interested in is this thing that has a certain kind of coercive power,
and rather than that coercive power being granted to some other mug, I
want it to be granted to me because I'll do the right thing with it. And
also [the main reason is I not only believe that I would do the right
thing with it but I also believe that the kinds of things that I want to
do at the level of scale can only be done by way of some sort of state
or state apparatuses.]{.mark}]{.underline}**[" So, **[their ploy is:
"(a) I'll do it better and (b) I'm thinking about shit at the level of
scale and you're just being silly and all you care about is these four
people that you're talking to right now."]{.underline}**]{.mark} See?
STEFANO: I do see, and **[I'm also interested in this question of scale,
because that's the side of the argument scale ends up on and who it ends
up on and with.]{.underline}** But, one of the things I'm interested in,
in the history of communism, let's say, is: **[under what circumstances
could I allow myself to be taken up and possessed by others, be in the
hands of others, give up anything like a kind of sovereign
self-determination that I will vote on every decision, that I will
oversee, that I will be like Lenin's inspectors, coming in to make sure
the state's doing what it wants?]{.underline}** What kind of communism
could there be where I could just allow some people to do some shit for
me, at the level of scale, and at the same time those people would also
at other moments allow me to be doing that kind of thing? So, in what
ways are we practicing, when we're for a dispossession of ourselves and
allowing ourselves to be possessed in certain other ways, allowing
ourselves to consent not to be one, at a moment that also lets people
act on us and through us, and doesn't constantly require us
re-constituting ourselves, which I think is implied? And this is, I
think, the anti-communism of Scott. Scott's smallness is about
self-determined autonomy. When you're small and in resistance, you're
always in control. Now, it's not that then instead we go for the state,
because obviously the state, despite the fact that, as I say, it's not
the thing he thinks it is, but a whole series of different kinds of shit
-- its effects are basically bad in the end. But, I'm interested in the
way in which **[[what we're doing already is and can be completely
complex, that it doesn't require some other step and that we need to
practice something else]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Autono- mists get this
all the time in Europe: **[[critics are like, 'oh, it's fine, you guys
can go o and do that together, but we've got a hydro-electric system to
run here.' And they often fall for that, and then sometimes you'll hear
the autonomists saying, 'what would it mean to build autonomist
institutions?' And maybe I misunderstood them but I think you don't need
to build an autonomist institution.]{.underline}]{.mark}** You need to
elabo- rate the principle of autonomy in a way in which you become even
less of yourself; or you overthow yourself more than what you're doing
right now. **[You just need to do more of the shit that you're doing
right now, and that will produce the scale.]{.underline}** So, that's
what's interesting to me. **[I'm interested in the way in which a
deepening of autonomy is a deepening, not just among few people, not
just that intensity which I value, but also it's a deepening of scale
and the potentials of scale.]{.underline}** FRED: Yes, I agree. I bring

What is **[ARMS]{.underline}**? **[Anything that a man wears for his
defense, or takes in his hands, or uses in his anger, to cast at or
strike at another.]{.underline}** Co. Litt. 1616, 162a; State v.
Buzzard, 4 Ark. 18. This term, as it Is used in the constitution,
relative to the right of citizens to bear arms, refers to the arms of a
militiaman or soldier, and the word is used in its military sense. The
arms of the infantry soldier are the musket and bayonet; of cavalry and
dragoons, the sabre, holster pistols, and carbine; of the artillery, the
field-piece, siegegun, and mortar, with side arms. The term, in this
connection, cannot be made to cover such weapons as dirks, daggers,
slung-shots, sword- canes, brass knuckles, and bowieknives. These are
not military arms. English v. State, 35 Tex. 476, 14 Am. Rep. 374; Hill

## 2AC -- AT: Psychoanalysis

#### The collective unconscious of everybody non-black is sutured by the criminalization of blackness -- their orientation towards the study of blackness is a way of securing the physic health of the non-black body secure humanities fat and blackness structural position of exclusion 

**Wilderson '18** (Frank B., Shifting Corporealities in Contemporary
Performance, "We're Trying to Destroy the World": Anti-blackness and
Police Violence After Ferguson, pg 46-49) B.M.

[Police brutality has never identified our problem. Our problem is one
of complete captivity from birth to death, and coercion as the *starting
point* of our interaction with the State and with ordinary white
citizens (and with ordinary Latino, Mexican, Asian citizens, Native
Americans]{.underline}). And so when I was in that room and I said 'I
don't hate police brutality, I hate the police', I think most of the
people in that room immediately understood what I was saying, but also
understood the problems with going outside and saying that\....Here's
one little example of how this conundrum or paradox affects the way we
can speak to White people and our so-called 'allies of color'. [In
Tulia, TX, in 1999, 45 Black people and about two Latinos were arrested
in a one-night drug bust. In other words, roughly 10 percent of the
Black population were arrested in one night. All of them were convicted.
There is a film about this that people can find online. What's
interesting to me is not the celebratory political and emancipatory
nature of the film, which ends by saying, 'at end of the day we were
able to get most of the convictions overturned, because the undercover
agent did not have evidence'. There was one undercover agent who
indicted 45 Black people and two Latinos. But he did not come to court
with cocaine. He came to court with this word. And what was interesting
to me about that was that when jurors were interviewed about that, and
people said to them, 'So you convicted these kids, some to 200 or 300
years, on no evidence, but on the word of one police officer. Would you
want that to happen to your child?', one of the jurors said---without
any sense of irony---'if it was my child, we'd need
evidence']{.underline}. So the problem then is not where the film
situates the problem, or where the media situates it, i.e. in the *rogue
actions* of the police. **[The problem is in the libidinal economy,
which is to say in the collective unconscious of everybody
else]{.underline}**. And if we were to actually understand that better,
we'd understand that **[Blackness is always-already criminalized in the
collective unconscious.]{.underline}** The only problem for white
supremacy and anti-Blackness when it's happening to Black people in
Mexico for example, is one of *logistics*, of *mechanics,* which is to
say, '[how can we make the criminalization stick?]{.underline}' It's not
a question of something wrong taking place, that these Black people are
suffer or exist under police brutality. Policing---**[policing
Blackness---is what keeps everyone else sane]{.underline}**. [And if we
can start to **see** the policing and the mutilation and **the
aggressivity towards Blackness** not as a form of discrimination, but
**as** being **a form of psychic health** **and well-being for the rest
of the world**, then we can begin to re- formulate the problem and begin
to take a much more iconoclastic response to it]{.underline}\....Here's
the deal: in a nutshell, every other group lives in a context of
violence which has what I would call a sort of psychological grounding
wire, which means that they can write a sentence about why they are
experiencing that violence. Native Americans can write a sentence that
says 'I'm experiencing violence because this is an ongoing tactic within
a strategy of colonization'. White feminists can say the same, that
'this is an ongoing tactic within a strategy of patriarchy'. For a Black
person to try and emulate that kind of interpretive lens, the problem
becomes a lot bigger. For us this is the ongoing tactic of a strategy
for human renewal. **[The violence against us becomes a tactic within a
strategy to secure Humanity's place.]{.underline}** It's not a tactic in
an ongoing strategy to take our land away, or to take our rights away.
We never had any rights\....The other thing is that our psyche does not
obey the objective laws of the structure. The simple way of putting that
would be to say that we exist in an external superviolence, and we exist
in an internal soup which has self-hatred as one of its main components.
One of the things that Marriot and Fanon each say is that, generically
speaking, the structure by which human beings are recognized by other
human beings and incorporated into a community of human beings, is
anti-slave. And slaveness is something that has consumed Blackness and
Africanness, making it impossible to divide slavery from Blackness.
[Even if I say to myself, "I am not a Slave", we don't make our own way
in the world. So we know every day, before walking out of the
house---and I think the American Black knows it quicker, like say at age
3, the Caribbean and African Black might know it a little bit later on
in life, like Fanon says, 'I was 18 when I learned]{.underline}
it'---that we cannot enter into a structure of recognition as a being,
an incorporation into a community of beings, without recognition and
incorporation being completely destroyed. We know that we are the
antithesis of recognition and incorporation. And sometimes we build to a
point that we can't even call it political because it's bigger than
politics, a point of mobilization and organization and theorization that
is in some way informed by this, and we just set it off, and I think
that Harriet Tubman, Nat Turner, and the Black Liberation Army are
episodes of that. But the response to these moments, where we recognize
that we cannot be recognized and we move on that, the response is so
overwhelmingly that it doesn't seek to end conflict -- say in Algeria or
Vietnam \-- it seeks to crush us to the point that nobody ever gets that
idea in their head again.

#### The white is incapable of the structural destruction of the psyche because there are essential to the elements of the Oedipal complex, they just reconstitute the humanism they aim to deconstruct 

**Gillespie '18** (John, Black Dada Nihilismus: Theorizing a Radical
Black Aesthetic, Critical Ethnic Studies, Vol. 4, No. 2, pg 104) B.M.

**[The white]{.underline}** artists donned as exemplars of the
schizoanalytic method of cataclysmic critique **[are incapable of the
structural destruction inherent to the schizoanalytic process because
they always maintain essential elements of the Oedipal complex, the ego,
the superego, and/or the unconscious, namely, the essential elements of
the human.]{.underline}** The concept of schizoanalysis is therefore
powerful, namely, in what it leaves unthought. The descriptive account
that Deleuze and Guattari outline in *Anti-Oedipus* of schizoanalysis as
a cataclysmic critique of structure leads us in formidable directions
yet points us away from Deleuze and Guattari's schizoanalytic pinpoints.
Therefore, to bring about a schizoanalysis, the theorist must look
directly at modernity's paradigmatic "schizo" or, in Achille Mbembe's
words, **["the mass of flesh," that, in this case, is the Black body, or
the Black artist.]{.underline}**9 The implications of doing so are
enormous since this leads one into the depths of blackness, which is
nothing other than that thing that continues to orient the structure of
man. **[If the entire Western political landscape is characterized by
pitfalls and shortstops that are not capable of providing a framework
for addressing and redressing anti-Black violence, then the "Negro"
problem is a problem that is internal to, but transcendent of, the
structure of the human and its conception of rights, sociality, law, and
ethics. There is no temporality "past" or "present" that opens the
political as a possibility capable of addressing or redressing
anti-Black violence. And there is no reason, purpose, or meaning in
aspiring to a "future" that will address the spatiotemporal conundrum
that the Black is forced to face. Therefore, schizoanalysis, as written
about here, should not be considered as an idea that Deleuze and
Guattari conceived of but rather as a label that Deleuze and Guattari
(mis) place on the actions of white artists, and Black artists like
Amiri Baraka and psychiatrists like Frantz Fanon have always already
been doing.]{.underline}**

#### Psychoanalysis is fundamentally an exercise that violently engages in the méconnaissance (misrecognition) of Blackness that imposes the White ego ideal onto Black people and thereby misdiagnoses Blackness as psychosis.

**Eppert 19** (Nicholas Eppert, Graduate Student at Fordham University
studying Philosophy, "This Body Which is (Not) Mine: Blackness, Gender,
and the Antagonism of Embodiment", pg 111-113)//KitKat

[Can the Black manifest itself1 or make itself appear in and through
Gender? Is the Gendered body that the Black ontologically manifests as
its own body (corps), its own self (soi-même), or is it rather a "ruse
of embodiment"?]{.underline} This is a complex question which requires
an analysis of the psychoanalytic vicissitudes and reversals of Black
desire, embodiment, identification, and (mis)recognition. I aim to
establish that a fundamental ontologico-psychic antagonism exists
between the Black and Gender, in the dimension of the lived experience
of embodiment. [This "psyche- soma"2 of Gender does not belong to the
Black, but is an imposition of the (White) Human Unconscious. Because
this question is so bound up with identity, I begin with the question of
what the Black considers itself to be, first and foremost, and how this
experience could unfold, so that the Black might understand its Gender
as a mask]{.underline}. For that reason, this investigation should be
read as if it were a psychoanalytic encounter, or the unraveling of a
dialectical process between Blackness and Gender in which subsequent
realizations retroactively sublate previous ones until sublation is no
longer possible and the pure negation (of Gender) remains the only
option. On the Fundamental Antagonism Between Blackness and Gender I.
Black Experience and the Problem of Masked-Méconnaissance What is Black
experience? Frank Wilderson III obliquely approaches this question by
asserting a fundamental antagonism between the (White) Human and Black-
ness, for "whereas Humans exist on some plane of being and thus can
become existentially present through some struggle for, of, or through
recognition, Blacks cannot reach this plane."3 The antagonism is of two
conflicting ontological structures. This is because "for the Black,
freedom is an ontological, rather than experiential, question (my
italics)."4 Why ontological rather than experiential? Wilderson's point
is that the perception of freedom for the Black is in fact a
méconnaissance of the ontological structure of the (White) Human, which
is itself, enslaving. **[The notion of méconnaissance (or
misrecognition) is intimately tied to Lacan's articulation of the
"mirror stage" in the which the previously fragmented body of the child
libidinally invests in, or "assumes \[assume\] an image"5, or imago, of
the "total form of his body"6, which, however, only exists on the level
of the Imaginary as "gestalt" or "ego-ideal."]{.underline}** [While the
identification of the fragmented body of the child as bodily-imago
allows for the coming into existence of the "specular I" or ego,
méconnaissance is in fact the "fundamental function of the ego"7 insofar
as it de- notes the inability of the Subject to recognize Symbolic or
intersubjectively structured reality in favor of the Imaginary. The
Black's perception (of freedom) is there- fore symptomatic of
méconnaissance insofar as it is a failure to recognize the onto- logical
structure of the (White) Human.]{.underline} Jared Sexton makes this
point salient in his analysis of the abolition of slav- ery during the
Reconstruction era. Drawing on the work of legal scholars Guyora Binder
and Anthony Farley, [Sexton argues that the Thirteenth Amendment, which
intended to abolish slavery, instead functioned de jure as a
manumitting8 of slaves, "redistribut\[ing\] the resources and power of
the masters"9 to the legal domain and displacing the experience of the
slave into the reification of a structuring lack in the letter of
American law. It would be a mistake to focus on individual perceptions
of freed slaves, for the law engenders the promise of freedom in such a
way that the promise exists only as promise. Méconnaissance occurs on
the level of the Imaginary when the tautological dimension of the
promise is (mis)perceived as freedom]{.underline}. Apropos of the
putative freedom of Blacks during and after Reconstruction, it is
impossible for the Black to recognize this méconnaissance as symptom of
méconnaissance, allowing the law to be revealed only as promise. This is
because the mis- recognition of the promise for the fulfillment of
freedom is immanent to the law itself. The law undoes itself in its
Symbolic capacity. In order to reveal méconnaissance as symptom there
must exist a mediating Symbolic domain via which this misrecognition can
become aware of itself in the Real. [But because the Symbolic domain
embodies this misrecognition, Black méconnaissance becomes a symptom,
which, as David Marriott brilliantly argues, is masked as symptom,
because it is the structure or the "group itself \[that functions\] as
symptom."10 Instead of freedom, it is the "perfection of slavery
\[which\] issues forth" from the desire of this promise, "the slave's
desire for equality itself]{.underline}."11 [Under such conditions it is
the Black's "self-assurance"12 of freedom that takes the form of the
fantasy of a desire that is without lack, or more precisely (in the case
of the Black, rather than Human) the fantasy of a desire which is not
enslaved]{.underline}. Since this fantasy is masked by an inability to
realize itself as symptom it is a fantasy which "fugues" the "structure
of the real": "thus it is that fantasy at once performs and masks
itself."13 This gives way to the dimension of "real fantasy"14 casting a
shadow over structuring enforcement of social death in the "afterlife of
slavery."15 Freedom is an ontological question because in the absence of
a mediating (Black) Symbolic structure that would allow Black experience
and desire to recognize themselves as méconnaissance, the ontology and
psyche of the (White) Human imposes itself as non-mediated "real
fantasy." [Black experience is not only a priori unable to distinguish
itself from Whiteness, but also unable to realize that in its dimension
of masked-méconnaissance it is an attachment or identification16 to an
Anti-Black ontology embodied as the World. Let us call this masked
misrecognition-cum-identification that the Black undergoes with the
World the condition of "Black Psychosis," understood in an absolutely
non-pejorative sense17, but rather as imprisonment in the (White) Human
Unconscious.]{.underline} II. (En)Gendering Méconnaissance **[Under the
concept of "Black Psychosis" I have so far argued that Black experience
and desire (for freedom) is intrinsically a masked-méconnaissance of
Whiteness. The Black is thus "wishfully, unconsciously-already a slave
to the imago of white- ness" and "this pervertibility is the condition
(to be violently affirmed) of what it means to be a black
subject]{.underline}**."18 I will show that through this White imago
Black méconnaissance embodies itself in and through White Gender19 via
an analysis of C. Riley Snorton's Black on Both Sides, where he
addresses the issues of Blackness and "trans" as ontological logics.

#### Psychoanalysis's claim on universality enacts a mode of liberal individualism that attempts to see the individual's wholeness mired in their distance from the space around them, or their ability to separate themselves from space -- this is a phenomenon fundamental to the scopophillic cultures of phallicized whiteness; their critique of the death drive merely reproduces the violence of white aggression because it resituates the liberal individual, this turns the K and makes the permutation's analysis of the K the only advocacy capable of solving the impacts.

**[Epistemologically, Lacan's account of ego-formation is a historically
and culturally specific account that, in claiming itself universal,
enacts its own whiteness (and maleness and heterosexuality, as feminists
have shown).]{.underline}** Ech- oing Hortense Spillers's argument that
this "universal sound" (1996, 87) of psychoanalysis is connected to its
disavowal of race and racism, I suggest that **[Lacan's accounts,
despite their radical edges, continue to circulate within traditional
forms of western subjectivity---forms that hinge on implicit claims to
universality.]{.underline}**6 **[While much excellent work has been done
to argue that psychoanalysis is not ahistorical, Lacan's discourse
nonetheless implies, in an appropriately Hegelian trace, a universal
structure---even if it is within the dynamic of historical or
developmental change.]{.underline}**7 **[There may be historicity and
change in Lacan's discourse, but it always follows and claims a
universal structure.]{.underline}** Working within this traditional
landscape of universality, Lacan's accounts have drawn on and assumed a
certain amount of ideological power that makes their explanatory power
difficult to resist. However, **[if they also enact---and sediment---a
racism that poses as structurally endemic to our cultural symbolic, then
we must discover ways out of and beyond Lacan's accounts.]{.underline}**
**[This epistemological quandary around universality is thus not
separated from larger political and ontological
troubles.]{.underline}**8 Semiotically, I perform a style of reading
that allows what Maia Boswell has called "an unnoticed politics of race"
(1999, 110) in Lacan's texts to surface. **[The omission of racial
difference as a significant dynamic from La- can's accounts of
ego-formation gives us an exemplary performance of how our white
supremacist cultural symbolic perpetuates its racism through the very
omission of race.]{.underline}**9 In his essay on the mirror stage and
the 1953--54 Seminar, race is never mentioned. Such omissions are, as we
have seen, hallmarks of whiteness's obliviousness to race---an
obliviousness that both supports the flourishing of white privilege and
perpetuates white supremacist racism. **[For Lacan, this omission of
race allows an account of ego-formation that enacts conceptions of space
and embodiment which, as enactments of the logic of the limit, undergird
racist structures of politics, meaning, and subjectivity.]{.underline}**
In giving no attention to the ways that racial difference is sig- nified
in the processes of ego-formation, Lacan enacts one of the central blind
spots of a racist symbolic.10 What occurs in Lacan's accounts of ego-
formation is thereby also one of the most effective tools perpetuating
ra- cism---namely, the omission of race from the field of signifiers.
Finally, as the larger psycho-ontological knot that reaches beyond the
scope of this chapter and speaks to the overarching theme of this text
as a whole**[, Lacan's accounts enact the conceptions of space and
embodiment that support the dominant forms of racism found in our
scopophilic culture.]{.underline}** **[Interrogating Lacan's accounts, I
generally ask whether ego-formation within an image-centered culture
necessarily breeds raced subjectivities---and thus a pervasive form of
racism that we find in cultures of phallicized whiteness.]{.underline}**
While I focus on the interpellation of images at work in Lacan's
accounts, I am also interrogating the conceptions of space that allow
this scopocentric and racist symbolic to emerge. In a more general
excavation of the dominant models of vision in contemporary French
theorists, **[Kelly Oliver argues that the conception of vision at work
in Lacan's texts "imagines space as essen- tially empty and objects (or
subjects) in space as points separated by the distance between
them"]{.underline}** (2001, 171). I want to investigate how that concep-
tion of space allows Lacan to work out a logic of the limit that
sediments not only a specific model of subject-formation, but also a
cultural symbolic of phallicized whiteness**[.]{.underline}** **[This
ontological conception of space as empty drives Lacan to conceive of
bodies, and subjects, as entities demarcated from that empty
space.]{.underline}** **[Op- erating as boundaries that contain these
entities, the logic of the limit func- tions here as the necessary
condition for ego- and subject-formation: one cannot become a subject if
one cannot properly demarcate oneself from the ontological emptiness of
space.]{.underline}** **[A subject is consequently he or she who is
properly contained, a dynamic that is constitutive of a racist (and
sexist), white supremacist symbolic.]{.underline}** **[I focus here on
two effects of this fundamental assumption: the emergence of this
subject as one who is shaped according to the dynamics of distance, and
subsequently cathected primarily through aggression and autonomy (not
unlike the liberal, neutral individual);]{.underline}**11 **[and the
hypostatizing of vision as the sense through which we ought to behold
the world, due to its ability to demarcate bodies and subjects clearly
and distinctly]{.underline}**. If this model of ego-formation, and more
importantly its attendant no- tions of vision and space, enact the
dominant models of subject-formation in cultures of phallicized
whiteness, then dislodging racism from its biol- ogized and visual
moorings is, as Stuart Hall suggests, perhaps the most crucial, even if
most difficult, strategy of anti-racist politics (Hall 1996b). Such a
strategy will, furthermore, involve unhinging ourselves from the kinds
of subjectivity that Lacan's accounts describe, accounts that continue
to func- tion in phallicized white cultures as normative, prescriptive,
and ideologically interpellating. **[We thus need to interrogate the
Lacanian reliance on optics insofar as it maps a symbolic that seduces
us culturally.]{.underline}** **[As we have seen in the emergence and
continued dominance of liberal individualism, cultures of phallicized
whiteness are deeply invested in the atomistic subjectivity that emerges
from Lacan's accounts.]{.underline}** **[And, while Lacan conjoins this
subjectivity ontologically with aggression, it has historically also
been conjoined with white supremacist racism. Therefore, if this
atomistic, aggressive subjectivity is also a racist one, then we need to
interrupt, interrogate, and redeploy this interpellation of images, and
the attendant conceptions of space, in which it is grounded---both so
that we can better use psychoanalysis through realizing its limits and,
more generally, so that we can disrupt the phallicized white supremacist
symbolic that is grounded in the visual field.]{.underline}**
