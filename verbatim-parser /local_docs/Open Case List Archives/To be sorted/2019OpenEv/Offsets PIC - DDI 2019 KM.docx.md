['Offset' refers to any type of non-monetary compensation that a
procuring government requires an exporting firm to provide as a
condition of the sale]{.underline}, and [it]{.underline} generally
[commits the exporting firm to spend a certain percentage of the value
of the sale in the procuring country]{.underline} (Petersen, 2011). [An
offset agreement is a contract between a purchasing government and a
foreign supplier.]{.underline} The latter is encouraged or even required
to provide additional benefits for the purchasing government's economy,
beyond the base transaction (Taylor, 2012). The term 'offset', or
sometimes 'industrial participation', is used in connection with
military items procured by governments: one factor in this is that,
since Article IV.6 of [the World Trade Organization
(W.T.O.)]{.underline} Agreement on Government Procurement
[forbids]{.underline} the use of [offsets in general while exempting
armaments, 'offset' may be deemed exclusive to defence]{.underline}
[purchases.]{.underline} Offsets may take various forms; according to
B.I.S. (2016), 'offsets in defence trade include a range of industrial
compensation arrangements required by foreign governments'. They are
commonly divided between direct and indirect, where a direct offset is
connected to the item purchased and an indirect offset is not, and
between military and non-military (i.e. civilian) offsets. The
compensation requirement may take various forms; the U.S. applies the
following categories for offset transactions: co-production, technology
transfer, subcontracting, credit assistance, training, licensed
production, investment, purchases, and other (B.I.S., 2016). Moreover,
governments that demand offsets may differ in the amount of offset
required and in the multipliers employed in calculation of the offset
value of a specific transaction (e.g. B.I.S., 2016). [Offsets are
extensively used in trading in defence material. According to Ungaro
(2013), offsets between 2005 and 2016 were projected cumulatively to
amount to \$500 billion internationally.]{.underline} The view that
emerges from the existing literature is that [offsets represent
marketing devices as nonstandard contracting in international
procurement amidst concentrated market structures and are particularly
valuable in generating efficiency gains]{.underline} though they
represent deviations from free trade.2 This is even though the European
defence procurement directive (2009/81) and [U.S. offset policy, echoing
the W.T.O. view, are against offsets. Yet in 1993--2008, 48 U.S. firms
signed, in all, 677 offset agreements, worth \$68.93 billion. In 2008,
14 companies entered into offset agreements, with 52 contracts, in
support of \$6.09 billion in export sales. For the last 15 years, the
compensation ratio for U.S. firms that signed offset agreements is 70.96
per cent.]{.underline}3

#### Japan relies on defense offsets to maintain its semiconductor industry.

**Mitra 09** (Anuradha, Additional Financial Adviser and Joint
Secretary, Ministry of Defence (Finance), New Delhi., A Survey of
Successful Offset Experiences Worldwide, Journal of Defence Studies,

Japan is a good example of a country which has utilized its strategic
importance and favoured relationship with a world superpower to develop
its indigenous defence industry in the post World War II years.

[Japan's industrial policy since the second half of the 19th century,
has been based on the principle that technology transfer and absorption
from the western powers with the idea of first emulating their
state-of-the-art techniques and finally overtaking them, is the key to
rapid, robust and diversified industrialization. In the realm of defence
industrialization, Japan has used its special position vis-à-vis the
United States to obtain substantial offsets in the form of technology
transfer and rights to undertake licensed production of high tech
military equipments and systems.]{.underline} It has built up a sizeable
military industrial complex of its own. Moreover, [the spin-off benefits
from the technological developments in defence industry have resulted in
huge gains in the civilian sector as well.]{.underline}

The Japanese policy of indigenization of defence production is shaped by
its overall view with regard to technological self-sufficiency and
ascendance. [The Japanese belief is that there cannot be real security
unless the country is independent with regard to technological knowledge
and competence, and self sufficient in the production of
armaments.]{.underline} A general unease on account of the excessive
dependence on American military support, misgivings about the state of
the US economy and its continued commitment and interest in backing
Japan, and the rising life-cycle costs being incurred on the maintenance
and upgrade of foreign systems, were other factors that propelled Japan
to strive for self reliance in arms production. Last but not the least,
there was a clear vision that the absorption of military technology and
the creation of domestic arms production capacity would have important
spread effects in the development of civil commercial technologies that
would serve Japan's long term goal of becoming an industrial and
technological superpower.

[A major source of the technology inflows into Japan came from defence
offsets. Japan has received from the US licence rights for a larger
number of defence equipments and systems than any other country in the
world.]{.underline} As per the US government data, between 1960 and
1988, licences for 28 major systems were given to Japan. These include
several programmes under fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft, aircraft
parts, sub-systems and engines, and missiles.

Transfer of licences helped in a rapid indigenization of the Japanese
military industry. Japan has made major progress in self sufficiency and
more than [90 per cent of Japan's requirements for military products are
now met within the country.]{.underline} There have been a number of
important developments in the aerospace sector. For the F1 fighter there
was a Japanese fire control design; for the T4 intermediate jet trainer
the fuselage and engine were developed in Japan; 80 per cent of the
materials and systems for the P3-C Orion are sourced from within the
country; the FS-X advanced fighter bomber has been built indigenously
with Mitsubishi as the prime contractor in collaboration with General
Dynamics (later Lockheed Martin); almost all the air defence missiles
required by Japan are locally produced. On the naval side, Japan
indigenously manufactures all the combat vessels and submarines that it
uses. In land systems, Japan has a huge capability for all kind of
infantry weapons. Japan's main battle tank in earlier years was the Type
74 produced by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, with many of the systems and
sub systems of Japan design and make, and the tank's 105mm gun
manufactured under licence from Royal Ordnance, a British company. This
MBT was replaced by the Type 90 - a completely indigenous tank again
manufactured by MHI as prime contractor, using several advanced
materials and technologies including modular composite ceramic armour
developed by local industry.

[The technological developments from offsets also had important
spin-offs in the promotion of strategic civil industries in
Japan.]{.underline} The technology for the brakes of Japan's famous
Bullet train came out of the knowledge gained from production of F-86
aircraft. In a unique example of sharing of learning and experience,
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries that produces the FS X fighters, use the
same premises, machinery and skilled operatives for doing works
connected with Boeing civil jets. Japanese firms have acquired much
knowledge in the manufacture of composites from work experience on tanks
and aircraft wing structures. Licensed production of military radio
equipment led to the establishment of the radio production industry in
Japan.

[Other kinds of spin-offs are with regard to soft skills including
advanced project management from handling complex military projects,
expertise in systems integration, production, inventory and quality
control, standardization of products, industrial engineering, etc. In
enabling the country to absorb such technologies, Japan's early
investment in human resources and education paid rich
dividends.]{.underline}

[In Japan, development of military and civil productive activities has
remained closely co-operative and interwoven.]{.underline} The military
and civilian industries have evolved together, not isolated or separate
from each other. [Japan's strategic industries specialize in dual use
technologies]{.underline} i.e. technologies which have commercial as
well military uses. [These technologies are great drivers of economic
growth and pervade the aerospace, electronics and telecommunications,
materials, machine tool, and automobile industries. In respect of a
number of critical dual use technologies such as micro-electronic
circuitry, semi-conductor compounds and robotics, Japanese industry is
perceived to be ahead even of the US. The dual use industries permit
reverse spin-offs with the advancements taking place in the civilian
sphere aiding new developments of military items and
processes.]{.underline}

#### Semiconductors are key to solve climate change

**Krysiak 12** (Robert Krysiak, executive VP and general manager,
Americas,

AJM)

Given the scale and complexity of the challenge, the key players
necessarily must include governments and the major energy-producing and
energy-consuming industries such as electricity providers and the
automotive industry. However, one industry -- [semiconductors --will
play a pivotal role in making the "unstoppable" force less
unstoppable]{.underline} and making the "immovable" object more movable.

The Unstoppable Force

Two paths offer hope. The [first is to reduce the amount of power each
electrical product and application consumes and to make the generation
and distribution of electrical energy more efficient]{.underline},
[while the second is to change consumers' energy-consumption patterns.
Semiconductor technology has a crucial role to play in
both.]{.underline}

Electricity consumption can be divided into three main categories:
electric motors  (55%), power supplies (24%) and lighting (21%). Today's
technologies and systems have been developed with a mindset that we
could call "P2" i.e. Price vs Performance. Tomorrow, we need to adopt a
"P3" mindset: optimizing Power consumption, Performance and Price.

There are several ways in which the energy consumption can be reduced.
One is via technology evolution. [Replacing previous-generation
transistors with state-of-the-art devices would save 4 to 5TWh/yr in
power-supply applications - the equivalent of two 500MW nuclear power
plants.]{.underline}

A second way is "[smart systems," which combine multiple functions to
reduce power use in individual devices and systems.]{.underline} The
effectiveness of this approach [has already been proven in domestic
appliances]{.underline} where the availability of powerful, low-cost
microcontrollers replaces the traditional universal motor [with a more
efficient brushless motor, which is typically 30% more energy
efficient]{.underline}. If all universal motors were replaced by
brushless motors, we could save up to 50TWh of power by 2020.

In lighting, today's cost-effective IC solutions make compact
fluorescent lamp and light-emitting diode lighting solutions more
affordable, with the result that the replacement of incandescent lamps
by CFL in Europe will produce a saving of 11.5TWh by 2025.

Similar reductions could also be achieved in power supplies. [If
state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies and electronics topologies
were universally adopted, the world could reduce consumption in
traditional applications by around 27%.]{.underline}

The second path -- helping consumers change their energy-consumption
patterns -- is more challenging because its successful execution largely
depends on local combinations of legislation and infrastructure. But
[enabling technologies]{.underline} such as smart systems, smart
metering and smart grids [are available and there is evidence that
supplying consumers with detailed information about their energy usage
patterns encourages them to conserve. A pilot program recently conducted
in Finland resulted in consumers reducing their average energy
consumption by 7%.]{.underline}

The Immovable Object

We can also encourage consumers to adopt (in whole or in part)
alternative power sources such as solar, wind turbines and other
renewable energy sources and make these sources more efficient. [Chip
companies are working hard to utilize accumulated expertise in silicon
technology, electronic circuitry and system architecture to make
renewable sources more cost-effective in producing, storing and
distributing energy.]{.underline} Today's [solar cells and electrical
storage technologies can store energy generated when the sun is shining
or the wind is blowing, then distribute that electricity during less
productive times.]{.underline}

Finally, we must accelerate the development and deployment of smart
grids to not only conserve power but redistribute it to the areas where
(and when) it's needed most. Upgrading the grid is perhaps the greatest
challenge because it requires massive but seamless changes to
electricity infrastructures around the world. The good news is that
[governments around the world have recognized that smart grids are an
essential development and are looking for ways to implement them into
national grids. There are many advantages to smart grids, one of which
is that they facilitate the wider deployment of renewable
sources.]{.underline}

2050: [By 2050, there is broad scientific acceptance that system
tipping-points for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and a sea-ice-free
Arctic summer were passed well before 1.5°C of warming]{.underline}, for
the Greenland Ice Sheet well before 2°C, and for widespread permafrost
loss and large-scale Amazon drought and dieback by 2.5°C. The "hothouse
Earth" scenario has been realised, and Earth is headed for another
degree or more of warming, especially since human greenhouse emissions
are still significant. 20 While sea levels have risen 0.5 metres by
2050, the increase may be 2--3 metres by 2100, and it is understood from
historical analogues that seas may eventually rise by more than 25
metres. [Thirty-five percent of the global land area, and 55 percent of
the global population, are subject to more than 20 days a year of lethal
heat conditions, beyond the threshold of human survivability. The
destabilisation of the Jet Stream has very significantly
affected]{.underline} the intensity and geographical distribution of the
[Asian and West African monsoons and]{.underline}, together with [the
further slowing of the Gulf Stream, is impinging on life support systems
in Europe. North America suffers from devastating weather extremes
including wildfires, heatwaves, drought and inundation.]{.underline} The
summer monsoons in China have failed, and [water flows into the great
rivers of Asia are severely reduced by the loss of more than one-third
of the Himalayan ice sheet. Glacial loss reaches 70 percent in the
Andes]{.underline}, and rainfall in Mexico and central America falls by
half. Semi-permanent El Nino conditions prevail. Aridification emerges
over more than 30 percent of the world's land surface. [Desertification
is severe in southern Africa, the southern Mediterranean, west Asia, the
Middle East, inland Australia and across the south-western United
States. Impacts: A number of ecosystems collapse, including coral reef
systems, the Amazon rainforest and in the Arctic. Some poorer nations
and regions, which lack capacity to provide artificially-cooled
environ]{.underline}ments for their populations, become unviable.
[Deadly heat conditions persist for more than 100 days per year in West
Africa, tropical South America, the Middle East and South-East Asia,
contributing to more than a billion people being displaced from the
tropical zone. Water availability decreases sharply in the most affected
regions at lower latitudes]{.underline} (dry tropics and subtropics),
[affecting about two billion people worldwide. Agriculture becomes
nonviable in the dry subtropics. Most regions in the world see a
significant drop in food production and increasing numbers of extreme
weather events, including heat waves, floods and storms. Food production
is inadequate to feed the global population and food prices skyrocket,
as a consequence of a one-fifth decline in crop yields, a decline in the
nutrition content of food crops, a catastrophic decline in insect
populations, desertification, monsoon failure and chronic water
shortages, and conditions too hot for human habitation in significant
food-growing regions.]{.underline} The lower reaches of the
agriculturally-important river deltas such as the Mekong, Ganges and
Nile are inundated, and significant sectors of some of the world's most
populous cities --- including Chennai, Mumbai, Jakarta, Guangzhou,
Tianjin, Hong Kong, Ho Chi Minh City, Shanghai, Lagos, Bangkok and
Manila --- are abandoned. Some small islands become uninhabitable. Ten
percent of Bangladesh is inundated, displacing 15 million people. [Even
for 2°C of warming, more than a billion people may need to be
relocated]{.underline} and In high-end scenarios, [the scale of
destruction is beyond our capacity]{.underline} to model, [with a high
likelihood of human civilisation coming to an end.]{.underline} 21
National security consequences: For pragmatic reasons associated with
providing only a sketch of this scenario, we take the conclusion of the
Age of Consequences 'Severe' 3°C scenario developed by a group of senior
US national-security figures in 2007 as appropriate for our scenario
too: Massive nonlinear events in the global environment give rise to
massive nonlinear societal events. In this scenario, [nations around the
world will be overwhelmed by the scale of change and pernicious
challenges, such as pandemic disease. The internal cohesion of nations
will be under great stress]{.underline}, including in the United States,
both as a result of a dramatic rise in migration and changes in
agricultural patterns and water availability. [The flooding of coastal
communities around the world]{.underline}, especially in the
Netherlands, the United States, South Asia, and China, [has the
potential to challenge regional and even national identities. Armed
conflict between nations over resources, such as the Nile and its
tributaries, is likely and nuclear war is possible.]{.underline} The
social consequences range from increased religious fervor to outright
chaos. In this scenario, climate change provokes a permanent shift in
the relationship of humankind to nature'. (emphasis added)

Born in the early 1950s, [Japan's semiconductor industry today boasts
more than 30 companies with fabs.]{.underline} Many feature 200mm and
smaller wafer lines with legacy technologies, form factors that account
for the bulk of the world's semiconductors and are the oxygen of Japan's
chip industry. Clearly, the world is not built only with the
state-of-art 7nm processed chips on the latest generation 300mm lines.
[Japanese chipmakers are flourishing.]{.underline} Automotive
Semiconductors [Renesas Electronics]{.underline} remains [a giant in
microcontrollers (MCU) and system on chip (SoC) devices]{.underline} for
automotive applications. According to IHS Markit, Renesas automotive
semiconductor revenue in 2017 [reached \$3.6 billion while Inineon
Technologies and NXP Semiconductors revenues were \$3.4 billion and
\$3.7 billion]{.underline}, respectively. The three companies dominate
the global automotive MCU global market. The company recently acquired
Integrated Device Technology (IDT), a U.S. fabless company specializing
in analog/mixed signal chips, to strengthen its automotive semiconductor
portfolio. Renesas operates four volume production fabs, according to
the latest [World Fab

from SEMI. Power Semiconductors With power semiconductors the chips of
choice for boosting the efficiency and performance of motors and
batteries used in equipment, demand for the devices is rapidly growing,
especially for automotive applications. [Power semiconductor companies
in Japan are legion and include Denso, Fuji Electric, Fujitsu

Origin Electric, Phenitec Semiconductor, Renesas, Rohm, Sanken Electric,
Sansha Electric Manufacturing, Seiko NPC, Shindengen Electric

attention of semiconductor manufacturers. All are familiar passive
electronic components suppliers -- [Murata Manufacturing, Taiyo Yuden
and TDK -- and all acquired legacy semiconductor fabs to manufacture RF
MEMS. Their high-performance radio wave filters make mobile phones
usable around the world.]{.underline} Research companies like Yole
expect the introduction of 5G cellular mobile communication systems to
fuel another wave of growth of the RF MEMS market. Japanese Supply Chain

#### Japan is key -- material exports

**Gyung-hwa 19** (Song Gyung-hwa, staff reporter, "Semiconductor
industry insiders calls for less dependence on Japanese imports,"
Hankyoreh, July 3, 2019,
<http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_international/900366.html> -
AJM)

According to figures released by the Korea International Trade
Association on July 2, [South Korean companies imported US\$112.66
million worth of photoresist, an essential material in
semiconductors]{.underline}, through May of this year, [with 91.9% of
those imports coming from Japan. These companies also imported US\$12.96
million worth of fluorinated polyimides (FPIs), used in the production
of smartphone displays, with 93.7% of those imports from Japan. The
dependence on Japan for FPIs fell to 46.2% in 2017 before shooting up
again more recently.]{.underline} These companies have managed to
achieve some degree of import diversification in the case of etching gas
(high-purity hydrogen fluoride), which will be subjected to import
controls along with the other two materials. [During the first five
months of this year, Japan accounted for 43.9% of etching gas
imports]{.underline} (valued at US\$64.78 million), followed by China at
46.3% and Taiwan at 9.7%. [South Korean companies had been highly
depended on Japan for this material]{.underline}, which is used in the
semiconductor production process, with 72.2% of imports sourced there in
2010. Over the past five years, however, the dependency rate has dropped
below 50%. Industry sources argue that this crisis should be viewed as
an opportunity to focus efforts on strengthening the competitiveness of
the domestic materials industry and to build a semiconductor ecosystem
in which smaller and mid-sized companies work together with larger
conglomerates. Semiconductors and displays are some of South Korea's
flagship industries, ranking first and fourth in export volume last
year, at US\$126.7 billion and US\$24.9 billion, respectively. Growth
has been led by major companies such as Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix,
Samsung Display, and LG Display. While observers have continued to argue
that the domestic materials industry needs to be strengthened because of
the high dependence on imports, little progress has been made toward
that goal. A special law was even passed in 2001 to assist companies
specializing in parts and materials as part of a scheme to reorient
trade on that industry, but that's now regarded as an empty slogan.
["There's a reason why Japan is so dominant in the global chemical
market, including semiconductor materials. Some South Korean companies
are engaged in the market, but they haven't been able to catch up to
Japan's technological prowess yet," said a source in the semiconductor
industry.]{.underline}

#### Japan key -- chemicals

The three materials are [fluorine polyimide]{.underline} as a liquid
crystal display component for use in TVs and smartphones [and resist and
etching gas necessary for manufacturing of semiconductors. Japan
currently accounts for approximately 90 percent of the global supply of
each of the three materials.]{.underline} At present, South Korean
[companies are extremely dependent on Japan when it comes to certain
industrial items. Last year, they imported semiconductor manufacturing
equipment worth a total of US\$5.2 billion from Japan and the annual
imports amounted to US\$2.4 billion, US\$1.9 billion and US\$1.9 billion
as for integrated circuit semiconductors, basic petrochemicals, and
other precision chemical materials, respectively.]{.underline} Likewise,
[they imported US\$1.2 billion of individual device semiconductors,
US\$1 billion of auto parts, US\$0.9 billion of silicon wafers, and
US\$0.9 billion of optical device components.]{.underline} The items are
related to the semiconductor, petrochemical, automobile and electronics
industries, which are South Korea's major export industries.
[Despite]{.underline} the South Korean government's decades of R&D
[efforts to]{.underline} help South Korean [companies reduce the
dependence]{.underline}, South Korea's [trade deficit with]{.underline}
Japan and their technological [dependence are continuing to
increase.]{.underline} For example, [the trade deficit rose from
US\$20.3 billion to US\$24.1 billion from 2015 to last year]{.underline}

Over the period [1993--2008, BIS estimates 45 countries to have had
defence offset agreements with US suppliers]{.underline} (obligating US
defence contractors to provide offsets) and [US firms reported entering
into 677 offset agreements (averaging 42 agreements per
year).]{.underline}21 [The cumulative value of these agreements was
nearly US\$69 billion or 71% of US defence exports worth US \$97
billion.]{.underline} On a year-by-year basis, the value of offset
agreements as a proportion of [the total value of defence contracts with
US suppliers has ranged between 34% in 1993 and 125% in 2003. The annual
value of offset agreements peaked at over US\$9 billion in 2003 (over
twice the average annual value of offset agreements, which was US\$4.3
billion over the period 1993--2008).]{.underline}22 [The cumulative
value of offset transactions]{.underline} (discharged offset
obligations), [1993--2008, was US\$49 billion or 51% of US defence
export sales. The annual value of offsets transactions peaked at over
US\$4.7 billion in 2004]{.underline}.23 BIS reports that between 1993
and 2008, US firms reported 9877 offset transactions with 47 countries
with an actual value (in current dollars) of nearly US\$49 billion but
an offset "credit value" of over US\$58billion.24 The "credit value" is
higher than the "actual value" because about 12% of all transactions
attracted "value credits" (multipliers) greater than the actual reported
value of these transactions. The most common offset transaction types
were: countertrade (purchases) at 36% of all transaction by value, local
content (subcontracts) (22%), and bundling, mostly taking the form of
technology transfers, at nearly 18%.25 [BIS also estimates direct
offsets completed by US defence contractors over this period to account
for about 41% of the actual value of the offsets transactions in
1993--2008]{.underline}26 [and indirect offsets for over
58%.]{.underline}27 Different countries' appetite for offsets deals also
varies widely. BIS shows countries with offsets requirements roughly
divide into equal thirds: those that demand over 100% of the value of
defence contracts in offsets; those that target the mid-range of between
50% and 99%; and those that accept less than 50%.28 Geographically,
Europe with an average ratio of 98.4% (and inter-country range between
28% and 172%) has had more appetite for offset deals than other regions,
including the Americas (average 97%), Middle East and Africa (average
44% and range 33--116%), and Asia-Pacific (39% and 22--100%). BIS also
shows the UK to be the top recipient of offsets provided by US defence
contractors: US\$7.2 billion or about 17% of all US offsets transactions
in 1993--2006.29 [Over the same period, the top five recipient nations
(the UK, Israel, Finland, Poland, and South Korea) accounted for
US\$21.0 billion or about half of all offset transactions.]{.underline}
Table 1 gives the value of offsets agreed with the top 15 importers of
US defence materiel and the actual and credited values (using credit
multipliers) of offsets transactions for the top 15 offsets receiving
nations.

are mandated, either by the laws, regulations, or expectations of our
customer countries; or they are dictated by competitive forces at work

price (low price or best value for the dollar), technical performance
(how well does the product or system work?), offsets (industrial
benefits provided to the customer country), and politics (regional
favoritism, in-country political forces, buy-local preferences, etc.)

[In sales where the competitors\' prices and technical performance

affected, **offsets are often not only a requirement, but are actually
the key to** winning **the sale**.]{.underline} No U.S. aerospace

## impact scenarios

### warming

#### Climate change causes a laundry list of impacts

**IPCC 18** ([**Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change**](http://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15/), "**Global Warming of 1.5
ºC," 2018,**
<https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/SR15_Chapter1_Low_Res.pdf> -
AJM)

Human influence on climate has been the dominant cause of observed
warming since the mid-20th century, while global average surface
temperature warmed by 0.85°C between 1880 and 2012, as reported in the
IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, or AR5 (IPCC, 2013b). [Many regions of the
world have already greater regional-scale warming, with 20--40% of the
global population]{.underline} (depending on the temperature dataset
used[) having experienced over 1.5°C of warming in at least one
season]{.underline} (Figure 1.1; Chapter 3 Section 3.3.2.1).
[Temperature rise to date has already resulted in profound alterations
to human and natural systems, including increases in droughts, floods,
and some other types of extreme weather; sea level rise; and
biodiversity loss -- these changes are causing unprecedented risks to
vulnerable persons and populations]{.underline} (IPCC, 2012a, 2014a;
Mysiak et al., 2016; Chapter 3 Sections 3.4.5--3.4.13). The most
affected people live in low and middle income countries, some of which
have experienced a decline in food security, which in turn is partly
linked to rising migration and poverty (IPCC, 2012a). [Small islands,
megacities, coastal regions, and high mountain ranges are likewise among
the most affected]{.underline} (Albert et al., 2017). [Worldwide,
numerous ecosystems are at risk of severe impacts]{.underline},
particularly warm-water tropical reefs and Arctic ecosystems (IPCC,
2014a).

This report assesses current knowledge of the environmental, technical,
economic, financial, socio-cultural, and institutional dimensions of a
1.5°C warmer world (meaning, unless otherwise specified, a world in
which warming has been limited to 1.5°C relative to pre-industrial
levels). Differences in vulnerability and exposure arise from numerous
non-climatic factors (IPCC, 2014a). Global economic growth has been
accompanied by increased life expectancy and income in much of the
world; however, [in addition to environmental degradation and pollution,
many regions remain characterised by significant poverty and severe
inequality in income distribution and access to resources, amplifying
vulnerability to climate change]{.underline} (Dryzek, 2016; Pattberg and
Zelli, 2016; Bäckstrand et al., 2017; Lövbrand et al., 2017). [World
population continues to rise, notably in hazard-prone small and
medium-sized cities in low- and moderate-income countries]{.underline}
(Birkmann et al., 2016). [The spread of fossil-fuel-based material
consumption and changing lifestyles is a major driver of global resource
use, and the main contributor to rising greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions]{.underline} (Fleurbaey et al., 2014).

### alliance i/l (generic)

#### Offsets are vital to US alliances and global influence.

positions at every level of command from senior aviator, chief of
contracting, commander, and director of various Defense Contract

Perspective," The DISAM Journal, summer 1999,
<https://www.discs.dsca.mil/Pubs/Indexes/v.21_4/petty.pdf>) - AJM

Military Alliances, Training, and Allied Modernization Nations tend to
align politically, economically, and diplomatically with other nations
with whom they trade arms. In a bipolar world this was especially true.
But even today the fact remains that [a country maintains significant
ties to the country that produces their weapon systems]{.underline}.
Since the breakup of the Soviet Union and the increasingly competitive
arms trade, alliances based on weapons sales can be even more complex.
From a military perspective, [weapon systems alignments usually include
not only military hardware, but also military training.]{.underline}
Training is also an interoperability issue. [Operation, manufacture, and
maintenance training for U.S. weapon systems is normally provided to the
purchasing country directly through contractors or through the U.S.
International Military Education and Training (IMET)
program.]{.underline} Regardless of the training source, these follow-on
activities provide strong ties with the U.S. and its military,
especially through training and education programs. [Through these ties,
relationships develop that strengthen our national security. Foreign
militaries become familiar with and learn American values and
professionalism. Further, English language training, technical skills,
and routine procedures are shared. They become]{.underline} [critical
to]{.underline} interoperability53 and [effective coalition
operations.]{.underline} Selling companies thus use educational services
to meet their offset obligations. Similar to the IMET program,
relationships and exposure through educator-student arrangements are an
important instrument of influence and national security. The Department
of Commerce Database for 1993-1996 lists 24 educational service offset
transactions valued at over \$229 million.54 As our friends and allies
build their militaries and upgrade their weapon systems, our combined
coalition strength increases. [Both South Korea and Taiwan have used
offsets to obtain leading-edge weapon systems and technology to counter
communist military threats.]{.underline}55 But such trade involving
offsets can also be a destabilizing factor to regional stability. In
September 1992, China protested the sale of 150 F-16 jets to Taiwan and
withdrew from negotiations limiting arms transfers.56

#### Alliances essential to deter conflict.

**Cohen 18** (Jordan, a Political Science Ph.D. student at George Mason
University's Schar School of Policy and Government, focuses on alliances
and alliance entrapment, "Alliances Are a Net Gain, Not a Loss, for
America," The National Interest, June 28, 2018,
<https://nationalinterest.org/feature/alliances-are-net-gain-not-loss-america-24562>) -
AJM

Inverting this logic, however, shows the reality of the situation.
First, allies limiting American primacy is a net benefit. Frankly,
[reducing the amount of war and conflict is inherently
advantageous]{.underline}, and can preserve U.S. economic and military
strength. In his 2015 article, "[The Myth of Entangling
Alliances](https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/files/IS3904_pp007-048.pdf),"
Michael Beckley argues that [U.S. defense pacts reduce the risks of
conflict. This is because, by having many allies across the world,
America faces conflicting commitments and needs to restrain itself
militarily so that it can satisfy these varying agreements. The
offsetting obligations allow Washington to avoid unnecessary
conflict.]{.underline} Thus, similar to investment portfolios, America's
significant number of [alliances reduce the risk of future
war.]{.underline}

Furthermore, because of [Washington's dominant position in its alliance
hierarchies, it can effectively restrain its allies from great
conflicts. Smaller countries that do not want to increase their security
risk will not engage in wars that their stronger allies wish to avoid.
These small countries see a security benefit from great power
alliances]{.underline}, and the former is subservient to the latter. For
example, in Asia after World War II, [Washington restrained South Korea
from attacking North Korea and Taiwan from fighting China via threats to
reduce American military and economic support.]{.underline} Moreover,
[the United States threatened to end its arms sales to Iran, thus
forcing Tehran to avoid joining the 1973 oil embargo.]{.underline}
Accordingly, America's alliances provide it leverage that increases its
immediate security and decrease global conflict.

Overall, Trump and other [critics fundamentally misunderstand the
benefit to the U.S. alliance network.]{.underline} [NATO and other
allies serve to maintain the current rules-based international order,
reduce Washington's risk of war, and decrease levels of global
conflict.]{.underline} Therefore, abandoning U.S. allies under the guise
of "America first" would harm American security, and just mean "America
alone."

built a robust offset program. [[IBM Canada has delivered over \$320M in
offsets to several defence suppliers and have been able to leverage the

investments position IBM not only as a valuable defence supplier but
also as an industrial participation partner. In exchange for delivering
these offsets, IBM Canada has gained overt \$50M in new business.

Recently IBM Canada has partnered with defence suppliers and the
Canadian Institute for Military and Veteran's Health Research to fund
big data and analytics R&D focused on this important topic. **[[This

Defense offset requirements are often viewed by companies as a costly

opportunity for all to benefit, not just an obligation to somehow
satisfy.

Korea](https://www.oecd.org/about/sge/japan-promoting-inclusive-growth-for-an-ageing-society-9789264299207-en.htm).
And according to the International Federation of Robotics, Japan is the
world's predominant industrial robot manufacturer, [producing 55
percent](https://ifr.org/post/why-japan-leads-industrial-robot-production) of
the global supply, with companies like FANUC, Kawasaki Heavy Industries,
Sony and the Yaskawa Electric Corporation leading the way.   

Robotics Pervading Critical Sectors

Convinced that robotics can play a key role in responding to the
country's aging population, [the government launched [Japan's Robot
Strategy](https://www.meti.go.jp/english/policy/mono_info_service/robot_industry/index.html) as
part of the revised 2014 Japan Revitalization Strategy, with a clear
focus on speeding the adoption of robots in sectors with low
productivity, particularly nursing, agriculture and infrastructure
construction.]{.underline}

While robotics have long been part of Japan's world class manufacturing
sector[, robotics are beginning]{.underline} [to sweep]{.underline}
other parts of the economy and society, like [Japan's]{.underline}
highly protected and inefficient [agricultural sector. This is of
critical importance as Japanese agriculture is facing impending
extinction, with a growing number of fallow and abandoned agricultural
fields.  ]{.underline}

[Since 1985 Japan's farming population has shrunk by around 60 percent,
while the average age of people primarily engaged in agriculture has
increased by [7.2 years over the past decade to
67](https://www.nippon.com/en/features/h00227/japan%E2%80%99s-farming-population-rapidly-aging-and-decreasing.html).
These trends are pushing robotization and automation into the
agricultural sector. For example, Spread Co., Ltd's Techno Farm Keihanna
is reportedly the largest automated vertical farm in the world, with an
automated cultivation system capable of producing [30,000 heads of
lettuce every day](http://spread.co.jp/en/files/news_20181101en.pdf). It
started shipping its products in November 2018.]{.underline}

Japan's services sector, whose productivity lags far behind the
manufacturing sector, is also being transformed by robotics, in sectors
such as finance, retail and hospitality. [For example, there are reports
of hotels being staffed by robots, like the Henn na Hotel]{.underline},
east of Tokyo, where there have been robots operating the front desk.
But the Henn na group has also encountered some challenges in the
robotization of its hotels. Following numerous complaints from staff and
customers, the chain has now [culled over half of its 243
robots](https://www.wsj.com/articles/robot-hotel-loses-love-for-robots-11547484628),
because they created work rather than reduced it.

[Robots are also being used in Japanese hospitals and elsewhere in the
health care industry.]{.underline} And humanoid social robots, like
Softbank's "Pepper," are being [promoted as social
partners](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-ageing-robots-widerimage/aging-japan-robots-may-have-role-in-future-of-elder-care-idUSKBN1H33AB) for
Japan's aging population, as well as people [in need of a
friend](https://gizmodo.com/you-can-finally-buy-a-robot-that-will-be-your-friend-1831736329).

Finding the Sweet Spot

Has Japan found a sweet spot with the coincidence of its aging
population and its robotics revolution?

[Advanced robotics do hold great promise for dealing with the country's
demographic dilemmas, as they can fill the gap left by Japan's declining
workforce, perform new and varied services required in an aging society
and offer improvements in productivity.]{.underline} But robotics also
presents new challenges.

#### Offsets key to defense trade with Saudi Arabia. 

(**Nankorn 09**, Pattarawan, PhD in Arab and Islamic Studies, The Offset
Programme as a Development Tool in the UAE, The University of Exter,
E-thesis online service)

[Among the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, Saudi Arabia was a
pioneer in initiating offsets]{.underline}; its programme began in the
1960s. To date, [Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, and Oman have imposed
offset requirements, with an indirect class of offsets]{.underline}.
They view indirect offsets as an economy-wide development programme. In
the context of less-developed countries (LDCs), the GCC offers an
interesting setting for the study of offsets in general, and of indirect
offsets in particular. The Gulf States have a specific characteristic
that distinguishes them from other LDCs. With oil revenues, they do not
suffer from foreign exchange shortage which is a common problem among
LDCs. Arms purchases do not cause a major negative effect on the GCC\'s
balance of payments, nor is capital a constraint for economic
development. Therefore, it is important to ask why and how the oil-rich
Gulf States employ offsets, instead of bargaining for price discounts in
defence procurement and pursuing other mechanisms for development.
Besides, the Gulf countries are \'rentier states\' which refrain from
tax collection, and they are not democratic states. Thus, offsets tend
to have a different political role in this context. This will produce
further interesting evidence of offsets. The reason that I select the
UAE flows from my personal interest in the country, the emirates\'
leading role in utilising offsets, the lack of academic literature on
the UAE\'s offsets, and the feasibility in conducting a field research.

#### Offsets are largely invested into health services in Saudi Arabia 

(**Mitra 09**, Anuradha, Additional Financial Adviser and Joint
Secretary, Ministry of Defence (Finance), New Delhi., A Survey of
Successful Offset Experiences Worldwide, Journal of Defence Studies,
https://idsa.in/jds/3_1_2009_ASurveyofSuccessfulOffsetExperiencesWorldwide_AMitra)

[In Saudi Arabia]{.underline}, offset programmes are not regarded as
instruments for counter-trade. [The objective of the offset programme is
to create a number of private sector business projects,]{.underline}
mutually beneficial partnerships between Saudi and foreign companies,
usually in the form of joint ventures. The Saudi government is looking
for technology transfer to upgrade its own capabilities for an overall
diversification and strengthening of the economy. Other objectives are
to make the best use of the country's natural resources, to improve
potential for long term export, and to develop various service
industries which are needed for supporting infrastructure.

The three major programmes through which the Saudi offsets policy has
evolved are discussed below:

Peace Shield: This was a programme with Boeing of the USA as prime
contractor for establishment of a ground based air defence facility in
which the Saudi government pursued an offset programme aimed at bringing
in high technology transfer content. The Boeing group set up four Peace
Shield offset companies-

The Advanced Electronic Company, to manufacture the latest and most
advanced military and commercial electronic equipment within Saudi
Arabia.

Aircraft Accessories and Components Company, for maintenance, repair and
overhaul of aircraft components like flight controls, pneumatic fuel and
hydraulic systems.

Al -Salam Aircraft Company for MRO, upgrade and modification of civil
and military aircraft.

International Systems Engineering is a company that specializes in
information technology, systems integration and development.

 Al-Yamamah: This was a major defence contract between the UK and Saudi
Arabia for purchase of military and civil aircraft, helicopters and
ships, with associated training and support, as well as construction
projects, with British Aerospace as the prime contractor. The total
value of this programme was around \$7-8 billion i.e. about four to six
times larger than the Peace Shield programme. The contract had an
investment target of about \$1.5 billion. Investments in
pharmaceuticals, vegetable oil manufacturing, petroleum, food
processing, health care and environment care equipment were also
welcomed. The objective was to acquire fully developed, proven
technology for immediate commercial application.

 Al-Sawary II: This was a programme for purchase of frigates from
France for the Saudi Navy at a cost of \$3 billion, carrying an offset
investment obligation of about 35per cent, in various fields including
glass, precious metals, smart cards and agro industry.

[Offsets have certainly helped to contribute to the industrialization of
Saudi Arabia, diversification of the economy, and participation by the
private sector in national economic development. A number of high
technology ventures which otherwise may not have fructified, came into
existence]{.underline}. Ventures lower in technology content, but with
favourable long term business prospects, have also been established. As
per the Secretary General of the Economic Offset Program, as many as 36
industrial service projects have come up, with investments totalling
about \$4.5 billion. These projects have created more than 6,500 new job
opportunities. In 2006, the total sales of the companies created under
the offset program reached \$8 billion and exports about \$1.5 billion.
[The main investments have been in]{.underline} the aircraft, electronic
and electric industries (13 per cent), [food and medicine]{.underline}
(12 per cent), and chemicals and petrochemicals (6 per cent). [Health
management through specialist medical colleges, nursing schools,
nanotechnology research centres and production of specialist medical
equipment are the next focus areas.]{.underline}

#### Offsets are a consistent part of U.S.-Israeli arms deals

(**Sharp 09**, Jeremy, Specialist in Middle East Affairs at the
Congressional Research Service where he provides analysis on Arab

Although FMF grants facilitate increased [U.S.-Israeli]{.underline}
military cooperation and [weapons sales]{.underline}, purchase
negotiations over sophisticated and expensive U.S. equipment [can in
some cases]{.underline} take years or [fail altogether]{.underline}.
Although overall cooperation remains robust, [U.S.-Israeli arms sales
agreements occasionally stumble due to disagreements over
knowledge/technology transfer issues]{.underline} and cost. In certain
cases[, Israel may request that it be allowed to customize U.S.
equipment to operate more smoothly with its own weapon
systems]{.underline}. At other times, [Israel also may seek the ability
to independently maintain U.S. systems in case of
emergencies]{.underline}. U.S. arms sales to Israel, like with all other
recipients, are subject to stringent End-Use Monitoring (EUM) as
mandated by the Arms Export Control Act (see Section 40A of P.L. 90-629
as amended).10 Overall, [Israel's defense establishment desires not only
the most technologically advanced U.S. systems, but the knowledge to
co-develop and integrate U.S. weaponry into its own defense
architecture.]{.underline} According to Isaac Ben Israel, a former
Member of the Knesset and Chairman of the Israel Space Agency:

#### Israel relies on offsets and the access to the global market they provide to maintain its economy 

(**Mitra 09**, Anuradha, Additional Financial Adviser and Joint
Secretary, Ministry of Defence (Finance), New Delhi., A Survey of
Successful Offset Experiences Worldwide, Journal of Defence Studies,
https://idsa.in/jds/3_1_2009_ASurveyofSuccessfulOffsetExperiencesWorldwide_AMitra)

The offset philosophy of the Israeli government is different from that
of Saudi Arabia. [The policy in Israel is one of encouraging industrial
co-operation]{.underline} i.e. the offset programme aims to promote
close co-operative working between Israeli and foreign firms, with the
long range perspective of enabling the former to add value through such
strategic partnering. In fact, the Israeli government agency that
promotes and administers offsets is called, appropriately, the
Industrial Co-operation Authority.

To understand this philosophy one has to consider the general economic
conditions in Israel and the level of their technological capabilities.
A dominant characteristic of the Israeli environment is the extremely
high skill levels of their work force. It is estimated that more than a
quarter of the work force has acquired higher technical and academic
qualifications. At the same time, manpower costs in Israel are quite
competitive when compared the Western world. The Israeli government also
chips in with large subsidies and other kinds of assistance including
financial incentives and tax holidays for R&D investments, further
reducing the cost of technological and research efforts.

By leveraging the unique skill sets of the work force, within a period
of about 50 years, the economy has been transformed from agrarian to
fully industrialized, with special capabilities in niche markets such as
medical aids and equipment, digital communication and information
technology, defence electronics, advanced agricultural technologies,
etc. Israel is today recognized the world over as a centre for high
technology. Israeli companies are known for their state-of-the-art
technologies and quality products. This makes it easier for foreign
companies to place high tech work in quite substantial quantities, with
Israel.

As mentioned above, [the government of Israel has, as a conscious
policy, spent large amounts of money in the promotion of research and
development. Israel spends about 3 per cent of its GDP on R&D, which is
at par with the most advanced economies of the world.]{.underline}

[In spite of the high levels of technical sophistication, the problem
that Israeli companies faced was that of lack of access to large global
markets. There was a need to link these firms with the global economy.
This is what the offsets were used for. Offset helped to bring the
Israeli firms into contact with some of the world's technological and
industrial leaders, and by partnering with them the Israeli firms have
been able to get an entry into the world market]{.underline} and add to
their value. [Offsets have enabled these firms to undertake high tech
subcontracting and R&D, and given them world wide exposure and market
openings.]{.underline}

[Offsets have also led to additional investment, new jobs and technology
transfer, which the Israeli economy was in a very good position to
absorb.]{.underline}

One of the important principles underlying the Israeli offset policy is
that the projects and activities pursued under programme should be of
mutual benefit to both parties. The underlying intention is to forge
long term strategic alliances between foreign and Israeli firms which
will outlast the requirement of the offset contract; if the policy tries
to extract too much out of the foreign firms it will lead only to short
term opportunistic projects and the offset partner will try to exit at
the earliest opportunity.

For this reason, the Israeli offset policy is quite lenient in several
respects. There is no clause for liquidated damages or other formal
penalties. A reasonable percentage (minimum 35 per cent in the case of
civil procurements and 50 per cent in the case of military procurements)
is asked for by way of offset. The policy does not lay down precisely
what sectors the offsets are to be directed at; the general principle is
of direct or other high tech technology transfer and defence industry
investments. This gives the country the required flexibility to take
advantage of any good proposal that may come its way. There are
arrangements for pre-offsets i.e. offsets without specific obligation
and for banking of offsets. At least 20 per cent of the offset should be
direct offset. The time period for completion of the offset obligation
is also flexible and negotiable -- usually it is stipulated at three
years.

There are two aspects of offset policy in Israel- offsets programmes
that are created as a result of government purchases and offset
programmes that are created out of private sector procurement activity.
[The Israeli government requires mandatory offsets on its procurements.
However, the volume of voluntary offsets in the private sector is
greater than that of mandatory offsets required by the commercial
activities of the government.]{.underline} The Industrial Co-operation
Authority (ICA) monitors and co-ordinates the offset policy both in the
government and in the private sector, although it does not formally
approve projects; conclusion of agreements is in the domain of the
respective parties that are taking part in the trade. The approach
followed by the ICA is of active support and openness to innovative
ideas and out-of-the-box proposals for fulfilment of offset obligations.

[Growing numbers of Malaysian offset programmes are making valuable
contributions to the development of local defence and commercial
production capacity.]{.underline} In the defence field, the 2006
procurement of the Swiss Pilatus PC7 MK11 aircraft led to a local
company, Ikramatic System Sdn Bhd, being awarded an offsets contract for
the design and development of a flight simulator visual system. AIROD
Bhd has also benefited from a Pilatus Aircraft offset for the upgrade of
onboard equipment, and earlier offsets contracts with Lockheed Martin
related to Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) work on C-130
transport aircraft. AIROD's growing expertise in the MRO field has
enabled it to bid for C-130 upgrade contracts against international
tender. There is also a Sapura-Thales offsets-related jointventure that
facilitated the development of local skills in the supply of VHS
communications equipment to the Malaysian Army. One final example has
regard to the ACV 300 Turkish offsets project: this enabling DEFTECH to
win an order from Brunei for the supply of 69 Malaysian 4×4 HICOM
Handalan II trucks.

In the commercial arena, [offsets have played a prominent role in the
development of Malaysian aerospace capability.]{.underline} CTRM, in
particular, has benefited greatly from the manufacture of components and
composite parts for the Airbus series, extending this expertise to
supply similar items on Europe's A400M programme. CTRM presently employs
around 100 workers at its Malacca complex, with a further 200 jobs due
to be created in the future.14 Additionally, design and manufacturing
capabilities fostered through the Hawk, Airbus and Fennec offsets
programmes are now being exploited by a Malaysian consortium (CTRM,
Ikramatic and SCS) to design and fabricate a tactical Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV).

[Defence industrial contracts have also cultivated a sizeable number of
firms producing lowtech 'common-user' items for Malaysia's Armed Forces.
These firms supply items such as ration packs, military boots, uniforms
and parachutes to both the local and regional markets. Glowtrade, for
instance, provides parachutes to the Malaysian Armed Forces and exports
them to Brunei and several other ASEAN countries;]{.underline} Pakaian
Saling Erti, employs 300 workers and produces uniforms and accessories;
and Semenanjung Selatan supplies combat rigid hull inflatable boats.15
Under the Eighth Malaysian Plan (2000--2005) government expenditure on
such diverse items as uniforms and accessories, medical equipment,
laundry, tailoring and footwear was worth around US\$28 million, spread
across 98 contracts.16

To expand the high value-added, high technology nature of Malaysia's
defence value chain, the government created SMIDEC in 1996. This
semi-government agency operates under the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry (MITI), providing advisory services, fiscal and
financial assistance, infrastructural facilities, market access and
other services to facilitate the development of a local sub-contracting
base. This initiative represents just one example of a recent broad
government push to promote defence-related vendor development
programmes.

[A major plank of this 'indigenisation' policy has been defence
offsets]{.underline}. Since the early 1990s, all Malaysian purchases of
major land, sea and air weapons systems have been sourced from foreign
suppliers, and all these deals, to a lesser or greater extent, have been
linked to offsets. As a consequence, the procurement of Turkish APC 300
tanks, Polish PT91 tanks, South African G-5 guns, the Brazilian MLRS
Astros 11, and EADS helicopters, have enhanced the opportunities for
local content in foreign-supplied military equipment. [The local content
has been achieved through the creation of industrial clusters of
domestic small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).]{.underline}

[Promotion of local sub-contractors through offsets has been
aggressively pursued]{.underline}. BAE Systems, for instance, has been
active in fostering local value-chains in Malaysia. Hawk aircraft
sub-contract work has been spun-off through offsets to domestic
producers, with firms engaged in the production of pylons, wire looms
and ground support equipment. Indeed, across the period 1990--2004, BAE
Systems is reported to have sub-contracted nearly US\$200 million worth
of offsets work to the four big Malaysian aerospace companies, CTRM, ACT
-- a subsidiary of CTRM, SMEA and Excelnet;17 and, importantly, some of
this work has cascaded down to local small and medium-sized enterprises.
For instance, SMEA has subcontracted work to UPECA Engineering, acting
as a fourth-tier manufacturer of machined mechanical components.18 The
exacting standards required for defence work has led UPECA to enjoy
improvements in process control, internal quality processes and manpower
skills in CNC machining.19 UPECA has been able to exploit this
technology-upgrading to create spinoffs in the development of
non-defence, safety and quality measures for the oil and gas sectors.
This has enabled UPECA to foster its own local supply-chain in secondary
processing, including surface treatment.20
