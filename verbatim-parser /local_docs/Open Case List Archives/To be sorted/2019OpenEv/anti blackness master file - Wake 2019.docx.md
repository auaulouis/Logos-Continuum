#### Observation 1: Targeted Murder 

#### Goldbaum '18 (Christina Goldbaum is an independent journalist and photographer based in Mogadishu, Somalia. Originally from Washington D.C., Christina has worked across Sub-Saharan Africa reporting on U.S. foreign policy, peacekeeping, migration flows, and human rights., 2-11-2018, \"Strong Evidence that U.S. Special Operations Forces Massacred Civilians in Somalia,\" Daily Beast, https://www.thedailybeast.com/strong-evidence-that-us-special-operations-forces-massacred-civilians-in-somalia)//pshah

#### 1A: It was around five in the morning when Abdullahi Elmi heard the gunfire. Sitting in his small home in Bariire, in southern Somalia, the farm administrator had been recording the names of the laborers who had worked the day before. Stacks of accounting books sprawled on the floor around him. Across the room, his wife sat with their 3-year-old son who dozed as his mother rocked him back and forth in her arms.

#### 2A: On July 6, 2016 -- Philando Castile is met with gunfire after being honest with law enforcement that he had a gun but it was placed down -- he was black. 

#### 1A: When the sound of gunshots began, Abdullahi thought they were too far away to be heading toward his farm. But within seconds they seemed to grow louder, and closer, sending Abdullahi and his wife, carrying their young son, sprinting through the nearby forest of banana trees in search of safety.

#### 2A: 2015, unarmed black motorist Sam Dubose is fatally shot and murdered during a traffic stop, his crime: not recorded -- he was black. 

#### 1A: Sheltering beneath the long leaves, Abdullahi came across his neighbor, Goomey Hassan, who had also sprinted into the banana grove with his wife when he heard the barrage of gunfire. The two families waited for 20 minutes before they decided it was safe to return, and began walking cautiously back to their homes, both Abdullahi and Goomey careful to walk in front of their wives in case the gunfire returned.

#### 2A: July 5^th^ 2016, Alton Sterling sells CD's outside of store to make a living, he's pinned down to the ground with his head on the cement and shot -- he was black. 

#### 1A: As the women entered their houses, the two men stood outside to see what had happened, eventually spotting Somali National Army soldiers walking in the distance. At first Abdullahi was relieved, the national army must have come to stop their rival clan from attacking their farm, he thought. But as the soldiers saw the men, they raised their weapons, ordering Hassan and Elmi to get down on the ground.

#### 2A: 2011, law enforcement receives a call about a man with a gun, after arriving on the site they noticed Jeremy McDole siting in a wheelchair -- he was killed -- he was black.

#### Both: "Blood from a gunshot wound poured into the earth around him."

#### 1A: "I put my hands up and they told us you are under arrest, then I heard the noise from their big cars and I knew this was more than just a clan fight," Elmi said. "They told my wife to go back in our home and then they went inside to search. I was pleading with them not to take anything."

#### 2A: 2014, 12-year-old Tamir Rice is shot and murdered for playing with toys outside -- he was black. 

#### 1A: One of the Somali soldiers ordered Abdullahi to put his head on the ground. The bottom of a boot belonging to an American soldier kept it there.

#### 2A: THE U.S.-LED OPERATION on Aug. 25 would result in the death of 10 civilians, including at least one child.

#### 1A: October 20 2014, Laquan McDonald is shot 16 times in the back because he was "armed" -- no weapon was ever found -- he was black. 

#### 2A: July 17, 2014, Eric Garner sells cigarettes and gets taken down in a chokehold for attempting to pay his bills, he's later shot and murdered, the officers walk free -- he was black.

#### 1A: May 4 2019, a black woman is fatally shot after yelling "she was pregnant" -- they were black. 

#### 2A: He was black.

#### 1A: She was black.

#### Both: They were black.

#### The 1AC is a protest to State-sponsored killing via police brutality cements America's promises to criminalize and present Blackness as the embodiment of danger. Our protest is the ingredient to democratic social change that is broken, bringing the possibility for a revolution. The preconditions for revolution are present but power has adapted, Optimism lies in the revolutionary moment. Civil society engraves the trope of criminality into black flesh, if a black person speaks out -- they are "uncivil," "beastlike," or "savage."

**[[The death of Michael Brown was not an aberration to American
democracy, but the fulfillment of its promises of order and stability
for the (white) majority]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As historian A.J.
William-Myers notes in Destructive Impulses: An Examination of an
American Secret in Race Relations: White Violence, "[white
violence...was part and parcel of the socioeconomic and political
structure of the American democratic process."]{.underline}11 [Pointing
to the "enormous capacity of American democracy to absorb unprecedented
level of violence and not be structurally damaged by it]{.underline},"
Williams-Myers concludes that **[[anti-Black violence and the societal
legitimation of the white agents responsible for the death of Black
people serve to maintain societal order, and bolster the implicit
ideological power of white supremacy in America]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Stated differently, contrary to the democratic calls for justice
currently insisted upon by activists and scholars alike, the deaths of
Black men and boys in America serve to indicate the health of American
democracy not its malaise. For young Black boys, maleness in a white
supremacist society is fraught with difficulty and the all too likely
outcome of death. **[Even as men,]{.underline}** this racialized
masculinity is not thought to result in a recognizable intellectual
maturity, and social standing of a citizen; rather **[the masculinity
impressed upon these Black-male-bodies is known only through its
uncontrollable excess, its lack of maturation, where any and all
transgressions (no matter how small or idiosyncratic) are understood to
be demonstrations of the more primitive and uncivilized aspects of a not
yet evolved savagery.]{.underline}** As Geoffrey Canada, President of
the Harlem Children Zone, remarks, "The image of the male as strong is
mixed with the image of male as violent. Male is virile get confused
with male as promiscuous. Male as adventurous equals male as reckless.
Male as intelligent often gets mixed with male as arrogant, racist, and
sexist ... Boys find themselves pulled and tugged by forces beyond their
control as they make the confusing and sometimes perilous trip to
manhood." The milieu from which Black manhood springs is saturated with
racist caricatures that all seem to legitimate the fear Americans have
of Black men. **[The images and perceptions of Black men as dangerous to
society, women, and themselves ultimately create a pattern of thinking
that works to justify their seemingly inevitable deaths.]{.underline}**
The relationship between anti-Black racism (the hate of Blacks) and
anti-Black chauvinism (the hate of Black males as the barbarous sex) is
not adequately captured by a focus on the manhood denied to Black men
and boys. [Such positions erroneously depict Black men as purely mimetic
creatures incapable of generating identities outside of the decadent
tropes offered by white patriarchy.]{.underline} **[A more correct
analysis of racism and chauvinism would understand that Black male
oppression and death is rooted in an imposition of a deadly masculine
caricature---a barbarism justifying multiple genocidal logics and
encouraging a racist misandry throughout this society and the
disciplines birthed from it.]{.underline}** Ultimately, Black male
suffering is made generic, thought to only be the function of "racism,"
so in an era pushing intellectuals and policy-makers alike to be
antiessentialist (problematizing racial explanations of inequality),
**[Black men are deemed "unfit" for study. [The Black
male]{.mark}]{.underline}** is not born a patriarchal male. He **[[is
raced and sexed peculiarly, configured as barbaric and savage, imagined
to be a violent animal, not a human being.]{.mark} His mere existence
ignites the negrophobia taken to be the agreed upon justification for
his death. [Black male death lessens]{.mark}]{.underline}** their
economic competition with, as well as **[[their political radicality
against, white society]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[It is this
fear]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Black males **[[that allows]{.mark}
society to]{.underline}** **[support the imposition of death on these
bodies, and consent to [the rationalizations the police state offer as
their justifications for killing the Black-male beast (the rapist, the
criminal, and the deviant-thug).]{.mark}]{.underline}** The young Black
male's death, the **[death of Black boys, is merely an extension of this
logic---the need to destroy the Black beast cub before it matures into
full pathology.]{.underline}** The Black boy, that child, is seen **[as
the potential Nigger-beast.]{.underline}** This anti-Black dynamic which
specifically affects the Black boy has been referred to by Elaine Brown
as **[a new kind of racism, a racism built upon the anti-Black mythology
of America's Black males as the super-predator.]{.underline}** This
super-predator mythology not only acts to legitimize the violence
responsible for the deaths of Black males, but inculcates the
rationalization that given what Black males actually are, [**[Black male
death is necessary and an indispensable strategy for the safety and
security of American society]{.underline}**.]{.mark} **[Overlooking the
genocidal disposition of America towards Black males presents an
incomplete diagnosis of the impetus behind the levels of violence and
sanctions imposed upon Black communities (Black women, Black families)
in an effort to control the lives of young Black males.]{.underline}**

#### When black movements attempt to protest, they are told it doesn't matter. Black bodies lack an ally in the activism against law enforcement weaponization because politics itself is inaccessible -- blackness has two options: either quit and give up or protest and speak up. We are the allies, we are the movement, we will call you out for the violence. The only one way to protest the internal link between police militarization and targeted killing is a reconsideration of the government from perspectives of we the people. Only the 1ac can expose foreign military intervention and it's relationship to police militarization and its effect on the black body; 1033 program takes arms from foreign sales and hands them to the police.

[The issues of [**police militarization** and
the]{.mark} disproportionate [use of force
against]{.mark} historically [**disadvantaged racial groups** are
inextricably]{.mark} [**linked**.]{.mark} The goal here is to provide
insight into the origins of **domestic police militarization**. To do
so, we build on our previous work to discuss how proactive [U]{.mark}.S.
foreign policy generates **undesirable domestic consequences**, which
threaten the liberties and **freedoms** of U.S.
citizens. ]{.underline}In the context of police militarization[, [past
foreign military interventions **led directly to the militarization of
U.S. police**. The]{.mark} undesirable[consequences have
fallen **disproportionately on minorities**]{.mark} ]{.underline}and
disadvantaged groups[. The main takeaway is that a proactive,
imperialistic foreign policy can impose significant costs on domestic
citizens due to expansions in the scope of state
power. ]{.underline}Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams are police
units possessing highly specialized military equipment and training.
These groups have become a fixture in many police departments in the
United States. In the mid-1980s, approximately 20 percent of police
departments had a SWAT team. By the year 2000, nearly 90 percent of
police departments serving populations of 50,000 or more had a SWAT
team. An estimated 3,000 SWAT deployments occurred in 1980. By the early
2000s, SWAT teams deployed 45,000 times every year. Current estimates
place the number of SWAT deployments as high as 80,000 annually.
Although now common[, [SWAT teams are a relatively new
innovation]{.mark}, one [that can be directly **tied to U.S. foreign
intervention**]{.mark} ]{.underline}and to two combat veterans, former
Los Angeles police chief and World War II veteran Daryl Gates and former
Los Angeles police officer and Marine John Nelson[.]{.underline} As a
Marine, Nelson served in Vietnam in an elite Force Recon unit. Although
originally designed to gather intelligence, these Force Recon teams saw
extended combat and were recognized for their use of lethal force. They
became well known for being experts at skillfully eliminating enemy
targets. For example, the \"kill ratio,\" or number of enemies killed
per every soldier lost, was about 7.6 enemies per Marine for regular
Marine infantries during the Vietnam War. The kill ratio for the Force
Recon units, meanwhile, was about 34 enemies for every man lost in
action. The Force Recon units were also more aggressive. Regular Marine
units were the aggressors in combat only 20 percent of the time they saw
action. The Force Recon teams, in contrast, were the aggressors in an
astounding 95 percent of their operations. Stated differently, the Force
Recon units were trained to gather information, engage enemy combatants,
and kill. They did so efficiently. These experiences were integral in
developing John Nelson\'s skills, knowledge, and abilities regarding
methods for controlling large groups, gathering information, and
eliminating enemies. He brought this unique human capital with him when
he returned to the United States and joined the Los Angeles Police
Department (LAPD). In the 1960s, Nelson was presented an opportunity to
use the unique skills of social control that he had developed abroad. In
1965, racial tensions set off the Watts riots in Los Angeles. The riots
left the LAPD feeling unprepared. In response to the perceived crisis
surrounding the riots, leaders of the LAPD were anxious to develop new
ways to effectively control the large crowds regularly in attendance at
race rallies. Drawing from his experiences with the Force Recon team,
Nelson suggested the development of a similar unit within the LAPD. \"A
small squad of highly trained police officers armed with special
weapons,\" he suggested, \"would be more effective in a riotous
situation than a massive police response.\" To take effect, however,
Nelson\'s idea would need administrative support. It was here that
Inspector (later Police Chief) Daryl Gates was essential. Like Nelson,
Gates was a veteran of foreign conflict, serving aboard the USS Ault
during World War II. And like Nelson, Gates returned home from war with
a unique skill set and had joined the LAPD. By the time Nelson proposed
his idea, individuals like Gates had successfully worked their way into
the administration of the LAPD. The presence of war veterans created an
administrative and cultural openness to the use of military tactics. In
fact, Gates himself wanted the LAPD be more militaristic and
\"aggressive, intimidating, and confrontational by design.\" It was
within this environment that Nelson proposed the idea of a Force Recon
style unit within the LAPD. With Gates\' support, Nelson\'s idea was
quickly adopted. The link between the newly formed paramilitary unit and
the ongoing war in Vietnam was readily apparent. Initially called the
\"Special Weapons and Attack Team,\" it was decided that the word
\"attack\" was politically unpalatable. Gates subsequently changed the
name to \"Special Weapons and Tactics\" and the first SWAT team was
born. The first SWAT unit consisted of 60 of the LAPD\'s top marksmen
divided into teams consisting of five men---a leader, marksman,
observer, scout, and a rearguard. The men selected for the first SWAT
team further illustrate how the skills developed in foreign intervention
influenced domestic police operations. According to the LAPD, each
member of the original SWAT unit had specialized experience and prior
military service. Moreover, the new SWAT team continued to incorporate
new military tactics in counterinsurgency and guerrilla warfare, hiring
military personnel to teach the SWAT unit. The use of SWAT teams
throughout the country expanded rapidly as a result of [[the War on
Drugs and War on Terror. ]{.underline}]{.mark}As we have written
previously, these conflicts[ [served as **catalysts** to spread
police militarization as **local police departments** became intertwined
with the federal government\'s efforts to combat drugs and
terror.]{.mark} ]{.underline}This relationship between the political
periphery (state and local governments) and the political center (the
national government) allowed for the expansion of SWAT operations
through the transfer of military-grade equipment and training. For
example, the DOD 1208 Program, implemented in 1990, allowed the
Department of Defense to transfer military equipment, such as aircraft,
armor, watercraft, and weapons, to state and local police to use in
their efforts to combat drugs. In 2013, a successor
program[, **Program** [**1033**, transferred]{.mark} almost [\$500
million in military weapons]{.mark} and gear [to domestic law
enforcement agencies for]{.mark} the purposes of [**fighting drugs and
terror**. The **influx of military equipment** into local law
enforcement, combined with the **adoption of military tactics** like
those employed by SWAT teams, created an arena in which]{.mark} the
liberties and [freedoms]{.mark} of U.S.
citizens [were **jeopardized**. Those most likely to suffer]{.mark} from
these changes [were those least likely to have the means
to **avoid** the enhanced coercive power of the state---the
poor]{.mark}, politically
unconnected, [and]{.mark} historically **[marginalized]{.mark}** groups. ]{.underline}Just
as racial minorities are more likely to die while in police custody, so
too are SWAT teams more likely to be used against minority groups.
According to a recent report by the American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU), SWAT raids primarily impact persons of color. Between 2011 and
2012, approximately 50 percent of all SWAT raids were conducted against
Black or Hispanic individuals while only 20 percent of raids involved
white suspects. The difference is more pronounced when looking at
particular types of SWAT raids. For example, some 68 percent of drug
raids studied by the ACLU were conducted against minority suspects
compared to a much lower rate for whites, even though rates of drug use
and selling are similar across racial groups. In some localities, Blacks
and Latinos are much more likely to be impacted by SWAT raids than their
white counterparts. In Allentown, Pennsylvania, for example, Latinos are
29 times more likely to be affected by a SWAT raid than whites, while
Blacks are 23 times more likely. Blacks are 37 times more likely to be
the victim of a SWAT raid in Huntington, West Virginia, than their white
counterparts. Blacks in Ogden, Utah, are 39 times more likely to be
subjected to a SWAT raid and Blacks in Burlington, North Carolina, are
47 times more likely as compared to whites. The question remains why
such groups are more likely to be disproportionally affected by police
militarization. Albert Hirschman offers one explanation[. He argues
that [individuals are faced with **two options** when they confront
problems within ]{.mark}organizations to which they belong,
including [governments]{.mark}. First, [individuals may
\"**exit,\"**]{.mark}** or withdraw** from [the
relationship.]{.mark} Alternatively, [they can \"**voice\" their
grievances** in an attempt to address and **repair** the problem. For
those groups most]{.mark} likely to be adversely [affected by police
militarization]{.mark}, however, [both of these options may
be]{.mark} weak or altogether [nonexistent]{.mark} for a variety of
reasons. For many, **[exiting]{.mark} a community** where police
militarization is prevalent [may be]{.mark} [**unviable** due to
financial constraints.]{.mark} Consider that [Hispanics are]{.mark} more
than [**twice** as likely, and Blacks almost **three times** more
likely, to live]{.mark} [in deep poverty as
whites.]{.mark} ]{.underline}Given these circumstances,[ the option to
exit is not feasible for many. As a result, these individuals
become **even more** **vulnerable** to state tools of social
control. ]{.underline}There is reason to believe that the \"voice\"
mechanism is also weak for racial minorities[. [One
study]{.mark},]{.underline} for instance[, [foundthat **increased racial
segregation leads to a decrease in black civic efficacy**]{.mark}. The
authors note that relatively [segregated black communities
are]{.mark} often [represented by politicians who **fail to vote** for
policies favored by black constituents. Ferguson illustrates
this]{.mark} concept well. [While 67 percent of residents are black,
there are nearly **no Black political
figures**.]{.mark} ]{.underline}Taken together, the lack of voice and
exit opportunities means that[ minority groups are often the least able
to avoid the **adverse costs** and consequences of militarized police
forces. [**Foreign and domestic policies** are ]{.mark}often [seen
as ]{.mark}distinct and [separate. In reality]{.mark},
however, [a]{.mark} proactive [foreign policy]{.mark} (i.e., [military
intervention) generates **unseen domestic** costs, including the
importation of techniques, methods, and tools of **state-produced social
control**.]{.mark} The militarization of domestic policing is one
illustration of how innovations in social control developed through
foreign interventions can **boomerang back to the
homeland**. ]{.underline}When these innovations return home they lower
the cost for the political elite of exerting control over the domestic
populace. [The costs of these expanded powers often fall
disproportionally on those least able to move or effectively voice their
dissatisfaction with government behaviors. [What can
be]{.mark} [done? Changing the status quo requires a **fundamental
reconsideration** of the]{.mark} scope and scale of [government by U.S.
citizens. Instead of]{.mark} [remaining **passive**]{.mark} regarding
the role of the state in their daily lives, [citizens must
become **skeptical** regarding]{.mark} the net benefits of the
projection of [state power, both **domestically and
abroad**.]{.mark} This is especially important for minority and
marginalized groups who are least able to avoid the abusive hand of the
state. Unfortunately, many U.S. citizens currently view the state as a
solution to their problems when in fact it is a contributing cause to
many economic, political, and social ills.]{.underline}

#### State must suppress down the US black movement through "clandestine operations...launched by the CIA," "surveillance operations against Black Africans" by the FBI, "Support actions designed to sharpen social stratification in the black community...giving rising between different Black groups," and to hire "loyal Black" figures. White governmental structures suppress all possible black revolutions, organizations like AFRICOM are supplied weapons to use against black liberation movements in Africa and an even larger number of weapons are siphoned to police militarization efforts in the US to police and murder black folk -- through the 1033 program.

oxymoron. This month marks the 10th anniversary of the United States
Africa Command (AFRICOM), created on 1 October 2008. **[[AFRICOM]{.mark}
is the re-colonisation of Africa by the US and [constitutes the new
scramble for Africa]{.mark} equivalent to when]{.underline}**, in the
1800s, **[the colonial powers fought over which of them would dominate
which parts of the resource-rich continent. [Pre-dating AFRICOM]{.mark}

Department of Defense supplies and equipment to state and local law
enforcement agencies, which are invariably used against Black and Brown
communities in the US.]{.underline}**]{.mark} The Programme has allowed
police departments to acquire vehicles (land, air, and sea), weapons,
computer equipment, fingerprint equipment, night vision equipment,
radios and televisions, first aid equipment, tents and sleeping bags,
photographic equipment and more. **[There is no more [glaring proof that
the US has been waging war against both Black people within its borders
and those in Africa]{.mark} than a cursory examination of the responses
by the US national security state to Black movements for decolonisation
and self-determination inside the US and on the continent. A parallel
history in form and essence unfolds when comparing what took
place]{.underline}** from the 1950s to the 70s **[in the US Black Power,
Civil Rights movements with the independence, anti-colonial movement in
Africa.]{.underline}** Documented evidence vividly illustrates that the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)'s infamous Counterintelligence
Programme, also known as COINTELPRO, orchestrated operations to
"infiltrate, intimidate, imprison, and assassinate" the leaders of Black
movements for social justice in the US. In Africa, the US executed
identical and chronologically aligned repression through the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) against the independent African governments
and liberation movements sweeping the continent. **[[No matter where in
the world African people are, our organising for social justice is
treated as a threat to the political, economic, and cultural interest of
the US ruling class that actually constitutes the essence of
Americanism.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Democratically elected leaders of
the new African states were subjected to coup d'états and incessant
assassination attempts including that of Kwame Nkrumahin Ghana, the
successful assassination of Patrice Lumumba in the Congo, and today we
can add the 2011 brutal murder of Muammar Gaddafi in Libya. **[[The need
to feed a growing and insatiable military-industrial complex and to
guarantee that no radical Black movements emerge within US borders or on
the African continent has given rise to increased and better-coordinated
militarisation both in Africa through AFRICOM and Black communities in
the US through the 1033 Programme.]{.underline}]{.mark}** US state
agents continue tantamount treatment, like spying on Black Lives Matter
activists, monitoring their social media and creating the bogus FBI
designation Black Identity Extremists to malign them as responsible for
violence against police. All the while tolerating organised, criminal
infiltration of law enforcement by violent white supremacists.
**[AFRICOM is the US response]{.underline}** to economic competition
with China and its increased influence on the continent. AFRICOM is also
**[to prevent the emergence of any independent African influence or
force.]{.underline}** It is not to fight drug trafficking or terrorism
as stated in their promotional materials. **[The US military presence is
a destabilising presence]{.underline}** demonstrated by events like the
2012 overthrow of a democratically elected government in Mali by an
AFRICOM trained Captain Amadou Haya Sanogo and the 2015 coup in Burkina
Faso led by AFRICOM trained Colonel-Major Gilbert Diendere. During this
month [**[the]{.underline}** Black Alliance for Peace **[has been
rolling out its campaign]{.underline}** US Out of Africa: Shut Down
AFRICOM]{.mark} urging all peace and justice loving people to sign the
campaign's petition **[directed to the House Armed Services Committee

administration immediately reversed within its first
year.]{.underline}**]{.mark} The Bush administration, progenitor of
AFRICOM, was rebuked across the African continent when attempting to
establish the headquarters for AFRICOM on the continent, forcing the new
command to work out of Europe. Then came the Obama administration that
paved the way for the proliferation of AFRICOM on the continent, as
quisling African leaders fell over themselves to cooperate with the
first Black US President. A now acceptable scenario has resulted in 46
various forms of US bases as well as military-to-military relations
between almost all of the 54 African countries and the United States. US
Special Forces troops now operate in more than a dozen African nations
reflecting a 1,900 percent increase in the US military presence in
Africa. [**[What impact has increased militarisation abroad had on US

The first actual militarisation of the US police started 28 years before
the 1033 Programme in the 1960s with the creation of the Special Weapons
And Tactics units --commonly known as SWAT. In South Africa (Azania) the
same thing was developed at exactly the same time. The Special Task
Force (STF) was an elite police tactical unit of the white settler
regime's South African Police Service (SAPS). The first significant
deployments of SWAT and STF units were to repress African/Black
movements for liberation. On 9 December 1969 SWAT was deployed for a
four-hour confrontation with members of the Black Panthers in a densely
populated area of Los Angeles. In 1967 about 2,000 STF forces were
deployed to guard the northern border of Rhodesia (modern-day Zimbabwe)
to assist Rhodesian security forces against the liberation forces there.
Roger Morris, former National Security staffer for Henry Kissinger,
admits that of the dozens of coup d'états that have taken place in
post-colonial Africa only two or three were free of the hidden hand of
US destabilisation. **[The sale of small arms to "Black Africa" was a
policy initiated]{.underline}** through Nixon's National Security Study
Memorandum 201: Increased Arms sales to Black Africa **[to stop the
"threat of communism." Today the conditions they have created are
dishonestly used as the pretext for AFRICOM.]{.underline}** Likewise in
the US, it has been shown that the rise of so-called street gangs like
the Bloods and Crips reflect a generation of radicalised youth misguided
after a decimated 1960s Black Power movement. In spite of gun control
laws like California's Mulford Act supported even by the National Rifle
Association to curtail the Black Panther Party's armed stand to defend
the Black community from police terror, **[[by the 1980s semi-automatic
weaponry and other sophisticated small arms found its way into US Black
communities and countries in Africa.]{.mark} US officials reject as
unauthentic the "Study]{.underline}** Response To Presidential Security
Review Memorandum NSC-46" **[that outlines a deliberate and
sophisticated policy of fostering political divisions between "Black
Africa and the US Black Movement."]{.underline}** Measures like: 1.
Specific steps should be taken with the help of appropriate government
agencies to inhibit coordinated activity of the Black Movement in the
United States. 2. Special clandestine operations should be launched by
the CIA to generate mistrust and hostility in American and world opinion
against joint activity of the two forces... 3. US embassies to Black
African countries specially interested in southern Africa must be highly
circumspect in view of the activity ... opposing the objectives and
methods of US policy toward South Africa..." are all arguably what has
been US policy. **[[The double standards and hypocrisy of the US
government are clear, making it imperative that the ideological
schizophrenia perpetuated by Americanism is broken. A mass movement must
emerge that exposes AFRICOM, confronting the powers that be about it;
and that makes it inseparable from the concerns we have over the
militariatsion in our communities in the United
States.]{.underline}]{.mark}** All peace and justice loving people can

spreading it to others and then getting involved.

#### Thus, we some people of the United States of America do ordain and establish that all direct commercial and/or foreign military sales from the United States targeting the black body for murder should be seized. 

#### Observation 2: Protest 

#### The United States is founded upon popular sovereignty as the basis for its system of authority. Declaring "we the people" is an embodied protest that uproots the legitimacy of the government's political authority to legislate as representative of the people.

IN DEMOCRATIC THEORY, ["[we the people" is]{.mark} nevertheless first
and foremost [a speech act]{.mark}]{.underline}. Someone says "we" along
with someone else, or some group says it together, perhaps chanting, or
they write it and send it out into the world, or they stand one by one,
or perhaps provisionally together, motionless and wordless, enacting
assembly; when they say it, they seek to constitute themselves as "the
people" from the moment in which it is declared. So considered as a
speech act, ["we the people" is an enunciation that seeks to bring about
the social plurality it names.]{.underline} It does not describe that
plurality, but gathers that group together through the speech act. It
would seem, then, that [[a linguistic form of autogenesis is at work in
the expression]{.mark} "we the people]{.underline}"; it seems to be a
rather magical act or, at least, one that compels us to believe in the
magical nature of the performative. Of course, "we the people" starts a
longer declaration of wants and desires, intended acts, and political
claims. It is a preamble; it prepares the way for a specific set of
assertions. It is a phrase that gets us ready for a substantive
political claim, and yet, we have to pause at this way of starting up
the sentence and ask whether a political claim is already being made, or
is in the making even before someone speaks or signs. It is perhaps
impossible for all the people who might say "we the people" at the same
time to speak that phrase in unison. And if somehow an assembled group
were to yell out, "we the people," as sometimes happens in the
assemblies of the Occupy Movement, it is a brief and transitory moment,
one in which a single person speaks at the same time that others speak,
and some unintended plural sounding results from that concerted plural
action, that speech act spoken in common, in sequence, with all the
variations that repetition implies. But let us admit that such a moment
of literally speaking in unison, and naming ourselves as "the people,"
rarely happens quite like that---simultaneous and plural. After all, the
declaration of "we the people" in the United States is a citation, and
the phrase is never fully freed of its citationality. The
[**[Declaration of Independence]{.mark}** of the United States **[begins
with]{.mark} such a phrase,** one that authorizes the writers to speak
for the people more generally**. It is [a phrase that establishes
political authority at the same time that it declares a form of popular
sovereignty]{.mark} bound by no one political authority**]{.underline}.
Derrida has analyzed this in some very important ways, as has Bonnie
Honig. [Popular sovereignty can give itself]{.underline} (in assent) and
withdraw itself (in dissent or in revolution), [which means that every
regime is dependent on it being given if it hopes to base its legitimacy
on something other than coercion.]{.underline} The speech act, however
punctual, is nevertheless inserted in a citational chain, and that means
that [[the temporal conditions for making the speech act precede]{.mark}
and exceed the momentary occasion of [its
enunciation]{.mark}]{.underline}. And for yet another reason the speech
act, however illocutionary, is not fully tethered to the moment of its
enunciation: the social plurality designated and produced by the
utterance cannot all assemble in the same place to speak at the same
time, so it is both a spatially and temporally extended phenomenon.
[When and where popular sovereignty---the self-legislative power of the
people---is "declared" or, rather, "declares itself," it is not exactly
at a single instance, but instead in a series of speech acts or what I
would suggest are performative enactments that are not restrictively
verbal.]{.underline} So I suppose my question might be formulated this
way: What are the bodily conditions for the enunciation of "we the
people," and do we make a mistake if we separate the matter of what we
are free to say from how we are free to assemble? I propose to think
about the assembly of bodies as a performative enactment, and so to
suggest not only that (a) [[popular sovereignty is a performative
exercise, but]{.mark} (b) it necessarily [involves a performative
enactment of bodies]{.mark},]{.underline} sometimes assembled in the
same place and sometimes not. First, I propose that we have to
understand the idea of popular sovereignty that "we the people" seeks to
secure. [If ["we the people]{.mark}" set forth [in the Constitution
"declare a set of truths to be self-evident"]{.mark} as they apparently
do in the Declaration of Independence, then we are already in a bit of a
bind.]{.underline} [A performative declaration seeks to bring about
those truths, but if they are "self-evident" then they are precisely the
kind of truths that don't need to be brought about at all. Either they
are performatively induced or they are self-evident, but to bring about
that which is self-evident seems paradoxical]{.underline}. We could say
that a set of truths is being brought into being or we could say that we
found those truths somewhere and that we did not bring them into being.
Or we can say that the kind of truths at issue here have to be declared
as self-evident for that self-evidence to be known. In other words, they
have to be made evident, which means that they are not self-evident.
This circularity seems to risk contradiction or tautology, but perhaps
these truths only become evident in the manner in which they are
declared. In other words, [the performative enactment of the truth is
the way of making evident that very truth,]{.underline} since the truth
in question is not pregiven or static but enacted or exercised through a
particular kind of plural action[. If it is the very capacity for plural
action that is at stake in claiming popular sovereignty, then there is
no way to "show" this truth outside of the plural and invariably
conflictual enactment we call self-constitution]{.underline}. If the
plural subject is constituted in the course of its performative action,
then it is not already constituted; whatever form it has prior to its
performative exercise is not the same as the form it takes as it acts,
and after it has acted. So how do we then understand this movement of
gathering, which is durational, and implies occasional, periodic, or
definitive forms of scattering? It is not one act, but a convergence of
actions different from one another, a form of political sociality
irreducible to conformity. Even when a crowd speaks together, they have
to gather in close enough proximity to hear each other's voice, to pace
each person's own vocalization, to achieve rhythm and harmony to a
sufficient degree, and so to achieve a relation both auditory and
corporeal with those with whom some signifying action or speech act is
undertaken. We start to speak now and stop now. We start to move now, or
more or less at a given time, but certainly not as a single organism. We
try to stop all at once, but some keep moving, and others move and rest
at their own pace. [[Temporal seriality and coordination, bodily
proximity, auditory range, coordinated vocalization---]{.mark}all of
these [constitute essential dimensions of assembly and
demonstration]{.mark}]{.underline}. And they are all presupposed by the
speech act that enunciates "we the people"; they are the complex
elements of the occasion of that enunciation, the nonverbal forms of its
signification. If we try to take vocalization as the model of the speech
act, then [the body is surely presupposed as the organ of speech, both
the organic condition and the vehicle of speech]{.underline}. The body
is not transmuted into pure thought as it speaks, but signifies the
organic conditions for verbalization, which means, according to Shoshana
Felman, that [the speech act is always doing something more and other
than what it is actually saying. So just as there is no purely
linguistic speech act separated from bodily acts]{.underline}, there is
no purely conceptual moment of thought that does away with its own
organic condition. And this tells us something about what it means to
say [["we the people,"]{.underline}]{.mark} since whether it is written
in a text or uttered on the street, [it [designates an assembly]{.mark}
in the act of designating and forming itself.]{.underline} It acts on
itself as it acts, and a corporeal condition of plurality is indexed
whether or not it appears on the occasion of the utterance. That bodily
condition, plural and dynamic, is a constitutive dimension of that
occasion. [The embodied character of the people proves quite important
to the kinds of demands that are made, since it is more often than not
that basic bodily needs are not being met by virtue of the devastated
ways of life]{.underline}. It may offend us theoretically to speak of
"basic bodily needs," as if a certain ahistorical notion of the body is
invoked for the purposes of making moral and political claims to fair
treatment and the just distribution of public goods. [But perhaps it
would be even less acceptable to refuse to speak about bodily needs at
all for fear of falling into a theoretical impasse]{.underline}. It is
not a matter of accepting the ahistorical or historical version of the
body, for even the formulation of historical construction has its
invariant features, and [every universal concept of the body is drawn
from very specific historical formations.]{.underline} So neither side
of that debate knows what kind of relation it is in to the other. Every
particular bodily need can be articulated historically in one way or
another, and it may well be that what is called a "need" is precisely a
historical articulation of urgency that is not for that reason a mere
effect of the articulation. In other words[, there is no way to separate
the idea of a bodily need from the representational scheme that
differentially recognizes bodily needs and, too often, fails to
recognize them at all]{.underline}. This does not make bodily needs
fully ahistorical, but neither does it make them into pure effects of a
specifically historical discourse. Once again, the relation between the
body and discourse is chiastic, suggesting that the body has to be
represented and that it is never fully exhausted by that representation.
Moreover, [the differential ways that it is and is not represented
saturate the representation of needs in fields of power]{.underline}.
One can also take into account the production of needs discussed by Marx
and amplified theoretically by Agnes Heller13 without claiming that
"there is no such thing as a need." We could doubtless use other words,
and trace the productive character of the words we use to amplify the
phenomena, but we would still be talking about something, even if there
is no way to get at that something without the language we use, even if
we invariably transfigure that something by using the language we do.
[[The notion of "needs" then would be an always already linguistically
transfigured sense of requirement]{.mark} or urgency, and would be
adequately captured neither by those synonyms nor by any
others]{.underline}.

#### The right to have rights predates, and is independent from, any political institution- Those excluded from sovereign structures can weaponize the right to appear in order to combat criminal regimes of the law-While the public sphere is built on exclusion and regulated modes of disavowal, performing the right to appear allows assemblages to call the state's legitimacy into question- the body's performance against state forces solidifies one's right to persist, a right not guaranteed by the law but rather the right to have rights

Luckily, I think [Arendt]{.underline} did not consistently follow this
model from The Human Condition, which is why, for instance, in the early
1960s, she [turned again to [the fate of refugees and the
stateless]{.mark}, and came [to assert in a new way the right to have
rights]{.mark}]{.underline}.9 **[[The right to have rights is one that
depends on no existing particular political organization for its
legitimacy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Like the space of appearance, [the
right to have rights]{.mark} predates and [precedes any political
institution that might codify]{.mark} or seek [to guarantee that
right]{.mark}]{.underline}; at the same time, [it is derived from no
natural set of laws]{.underline}. **[[The right comes into being when it
is exercised]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and exercised **[[by those who
act]{.mark} in concert, [in alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [Those who
are excluded from existing polities, who belong to no nation-state
or]{.underline}]{.mark} [other contemporary [state formation]{.mark},
may be deemed "unreal"]{.underline} only by those who seek to monopolize
the terms of reality. And yet, [even after the public sphere has been
defined through their exclusion, **they act**]{.underline}. [[Whether
they are abandoned to precarity or left to die through systematic
negligence, concerted action still emerges from their acting
together]{.underline}]{.mark}. And this is what we see, for instance,
[when [undocumented workers amass on the street without the legal right
to do so]{.mark}]{.underline}; when squatters lay claim to buildings in
Argentina as a way of exercising the right to livable shelter; when
populations lay claim to a public square that has belonged to the
military; [when [refugees take part in collective uprisings demanding
shelter, food, and rights of sanctuary]{.mark}]{.underline}; [when
[populations amass, without the protection of the law and without
permits to demonstrate, to bring down an unjust or criminal regime of
law]{.mark} or to protest austerity]{.underline} measures that destroy
the possibility of employment and education for many. [Or when those
whose public appearance is itself criminal]{.underline}---transgendered
people in Turkey or women who wear the veil in France---[appear in order
to contest that criminal status and assert the right to
appear.]{.underline} The French law that prohibits "ostentatious"
religious display in public as well as the hiding of the face seeks to
establish a public sphere where clothing remains a signifier of
secularism and the exposure of the face becomes a public norm. [[The
prohibition]{.mark} against hiding the face [serves a]{.mark} certain
[version of the right to appear]{.mark}, understood as [the right for
women to appear unveiled]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [At the same
time, it denies the right to appear for that very group of women,
requiring them to defy religious norms in favor of public
ones]{.underline}. That required act of religious disaffiliation becomes
obligatory when the public sphere is understood as one that overcomes or
negates religious forms of belonging. The notion, prevalent in French
debate, that women who wear the veil cannot possibly do so from any
sense of choice operates in the debate to veil, as it were, the blatant
acts of discrimination against religious minorities that the law enacts.
For one choice that is clearly made among those who wear the veil is not
to comply with those forms of compulsory disaffiliation that condition
the entrance to the public sphere. Here as elsewhere, [the sphere of
appearance is highly regulated]{.underline}. [That these women be
clothed in some ways rather than others constitutes a sartorial politics
of the public sphere, but so too does compulsory "unveiling," itself a
sign of belonging first to the public]{.underline} and only secondarily,
or privately, to the religious community. This is especially pronounced
in relation to Muslim women whose affiliations to various versions of
public, secular, and religious domains may well be coterminous and
overlapping. [And it shows quite clearly that what is called ["the
public sphere"]{.mark} in such cases [is built up through constitutive
exclusions and compulsory forms of
disavowal]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} **[Paradoxically, the act of
[conforming to a law that requires unveiling is the means by which
a]{.mark} certainly highly compromised, even [violent, "freedom to
appear" is established]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Indeed, in the public
demonstrations that often follow from acts of public mourning---as often
occurred in Syria before half of its population became refugees, where
crowds of mourners became targets of military destruction---we can see
how [[the existing public space is seized by those who have no existing
right to gather there]{.mark}, who emerge from zones of disappearance to
become bodies [exposed to violence and death in the course of gathering
and persisting publicly as they do]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [it is
their right to gather, free of intimidation and the threat of violence,
that is systematically attacked by the police, the army, hired gangs, or
mercenaries. [To attack those bodies is to attack the right itself,
since when those bodies appear and act, they are exercising a
right]{.mark}]{.underline} outside, against, and in the face of the
regime. Although [[the bodies on the street are vocalizing their
opposition to the legitimacy of the state]{.underline}]{.mark}, [they
are also, by virtue of occupying and persisting in that space without
protection, posing their challenge in corporeal terms, which means that
when the body "speaks" politically, it is not only in vocal or written
language.]{.underline} The persistence of [[the body in its exposure
calls that legitimacy into question and does so precisely through a
specific performativity of the body]{.underline}]{.mark}.10 Both action
and gesture signify and speak, both as action and claim; the one is not
finally extricable from the other. **[[Where the legitimacy of the state
is brought into question]{.mark} precisely by that way of appearing in
public, [the body]{.mark} itself exercises a right that is no right; in
other words, it [exercises a right that is being actively contested and
destroyed by military force and]{.mark} that, in its resistance to
force, [articulates its way of living, showing both its precarity and
its right to persist]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [[This right]{.mark} is
codified nowhere]{.underline}. [It [is not granted]{.mark}]{.underline}
from elsewhere or [[by]{.mark} existing [law]{.mark}, [even if it
sometimes finds support]{.mark} precisely [there. It is]{.mark}, in
fact, [the right to have rights]{.mark}]{.underline}, not as natural law
or metaphysical stipulation, but [as the persistence]{.underline} of the
body [[against those forces that seek its]{.mark}]{.underline}
debilitation or [[eradication]{.underline}]{.mark}. This persistence
requires breaking into the established regime of space with a set of
material supports both mobilized and mobilizing.

just might work to change the status quo. In the final analysis,
Occupy's success came from a profound, overriding and widely shared
conviction that this was it-the mass social movement that would change
everything. [This belief turned out to be founded on]{.underline} a
number of unquestioned assumptions about [how to **shift political
reality**. [We believed that]{.mark} nominally [democratic governments
would be swayed by a historic event that was mass]{.mark}, urban,
**[non-violent and unified]{.mark}**.]{.underline} These four
characteristics had dominated the theory and practice of revolution for
decades, especially after the revolutionary waves of 1989 that toppled
Communism in Poland, Hungary, East Germany, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and
Romania. In our inaugural tactical briefing, Kalle and I had articulated
this assumption with a story of how [an occupation of Wall Street could
lead to **fundamental change**. "If we hang in there, twenty-thousand
strong, week after week against every police and National Guard effort
to expel us from Wall Street, it would be impossible for Obama to ignore
us.]{.underline} Our government would be forced to choose publicly
between the will of the people and the lucre of the corporations." In
other words, [[we maintained a **theatrical view of activism** that
treats public space as the stage for a **political spectacle.** We
assumed]{.mark} that [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [would
be]{.mark} [unable to use force]{.mark} against non-violent democracy
[protesters without]{.mark} eventually [capitulating]{.mark} to our
demands [because]{.mark} the eyes of the international community would
be on our political performance.]{.underline} As one popular protest
chant puts it, [["**The whole world is watching**!"]{.underline}]{.mark}
Kalle and I --and many activists who flocked to the encapments-believed
that if the world watched the Occupiers maintain their dignity and
demands in the face of police brutality, the movement would win...just
as it had seemed to win in Tunisia and Egypt. The first part of our
story came true. Occupiers overcame extreme adversity to keep the
movement alive. Ultimately, [over [seven]{.mark} [thousand participants
in Occupy were arrested]{.mark} in the United States, [and]{.mark} many
people [experienced]{.mark} serious [injuries]{.mark}]{.underline} and
broken bones [[caused]{.mark} [by **police
violence**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Police brutality was particularly
rampant against Occupiers in Oakland, California, where numerous
complaints were filed against authorities. In one complaint from October
25, for example, [a protester alleged, "Officers found a person alone,
**beat him**, and broke his knee." But the second part of our story of
change, [the faith that]{.mark} brutal [repression of]{.mark} dignified
[occupiers would **backfire** against the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates, [proved to be **wrong**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Occupy
Wall Street was a constructive failure but not a total failure.
[Occupy]{.underline} demonstrated the efficacy of using social memes to
quickly spread a movement, shifted the political debate on the fair
distribution of wealth, trained a new generation of activists who went
on to be the base for movements ranging from campus fossil fuel
divestment to Black Lives Matter protests. Occupy launched many local
projects that will have lasting small-scale impact. Occupy buoyed many
institutional activist organizations that were able to materially profit
from the renewed interest in protest. All of these are signs that our
movement was culturally influential. It may be comforting to believe
that Occupy splintered into a thousand shards of light. [However, [an
**honest assessment reveals** that Occupy]{.mark} Wall Street failed to
live up to its **revolutionary potential**: we [did not]{.mark} bring an
[end]{.mark} to [the influence of money]{.mark} on democracy,
[**overthrow** the]{.mark} corporatocracy of the [1percent or solve
income inequality.]{.mark} If our movement did achieve successes, they
were not the ones we'd intended. When **victory eluded Occupy**, a world
of activist certainties fell apart.]{.underline} I call [occupy Wall
Street]{.underline} a constructive failure because the movement
[revealed underlying flaws in dominant]{.underline}, and still
prevalent, [theories of how to achieve social change]{.underline}
through collective action. Occupy set out to "get money out of
politics," and we succeeded in catalyzing a global social movement that
tested all of our hypotheses. [[The failure]{.mark} of our efforts
[reveals]{.mark} a truth that will hasten the next successful
revolution: **the assumptions underlying contemporary protest are
false**. [Change won't happen through the **old models of
activism**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Western democracies will not be swayed
by public spectacles and mass media frenzy. [[Protests have become an
accepted, and]{.mark} therefore [ignored]{.mark}, by-product of
**politics-as-usual**.]{.underline} Western governments are not
susceptible to international pressure to heed the protests of their
citizens. Occupy's failure was constructive because it demonstrated the
limitations of contemporary ideas of Protest. I capitalize p to
emphasize that [the limitation was not in a particular tactic but rather
in our concept of Protest, or our theory of social change, which
determined the overall script. Occupy revealed that [activists need to
**revolutionize** **their approach to revolution.**
]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Failure can be liberating. Defeat detaches us
from]{.mark} a [theory]{.mark} of revolution [that is no longer
effective, reopening the **possibility of true
change**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} "For a revolutionary," writes Regis
Debray, professor of philosophy and associate of Che Guevara, "[failure
is a springboard]{.underline}. As a source of theory it is richer than
victory: [it accumulates experience and knowledge]{.underline}."
Opportunities to test the fundamental principles of activism are as rare
as revolutionary moments. In North America, activists had to wait eight
years, following the defeat of the anti-Iraq War movement, for a social
movement that would test our assumptions on a planetary scale. [[The
anti-Iraq War movement **collapsed** after its global march]{.mark} on
February 15, 2003, the **largest synchronized protest in human
history**, [failed to sway President Bush]{.mark} and Prime Minister
Blair [to halt the pre-emptive war on Iraq]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Activists in 2003 believed that if millions of people around the world
said no in unison on a single day, war would be impossible. [Like
Occupy, the anti-war movement vaporized when the theory of social change
underlying the movement-that governments will bend if millions of people
assemble in the streets, march, and make a single demand-was proven
ineffective.]{.underline}

###  AT -- V -- Fairness

#### Academic Restlessness DA---Debaters hunger for a new, attention-grabbing paradigm to market when the excitement of a new interpretation wears off. Traditional debaters are eager to capitalize on our protest to demote race and sexuality in this space. This academic restlessness must dominate the representations of debate, such that it becomes impossible to understand the common enemy that can unite traditional and critical debaters. The more self-consciously pleased and disturbed you become in your affirmed and enforced interpretations of "predictability, fairness, and education", the more restless we become inside them. Belonging to this community formed through the domination of framework, our oppression affords us a system to overthrow.

**Ross 2k** (Assc. Director of the Center for AfroAmerican and African
Studies @ U Mich, 2000, Marlon-Professor of English; *Pleasuring
Identity, or the Delicious Politics of Belonging*; NEW LITERARY HISTORY,
Vol. 31, No. 4, Is There Life after Identity Politics?; Autumn, 2000;
pp.827-850.) \\\\EG

Another reason we may be restless inside identity theory is because,
according to the institutional expectations of academe, [[we hunger for
a new, **attention-grabbing**]{.mark} [**paradigm** to market]{.mark} at
[the moment]{.mark} that [the sexiness of a new method]{.mark} seems to
[**wear off**. Anti-identity advocates]{.mark} can smell that moment
approaching and [are **eager to capitalize** on it to **demote
race**]{.mark}**, gender, [and sexuality]{.mark}** [and the identity
groups]{.mark} that [these]{.mark} [categories]{.mark} supposedly
[represent. This]{.mark}]{.underline} sort of [[**academic
restlessness** is]{.underline}]{.mark} a bit
[[underhanded]{.underline}]{.mark}, given that we have been studying
solely the intellectual identity of Aristotle for nigh 2400 years, and
yet there is no movement to clamp down on those who take pleasure in the
study of Aristotelian physics, metaphysics, posterior analytics, ethics,
and poetics, even though these have ceased to provide a living paradigm
for modernity. [This]{.underline} kind of [academic restlessness can
also take place within such an identity discipline like **feminism or
queer studies**.]{.underline} As Wiegman suggests, [certain feminists
are anxious to **return to a universal woman** because they have grown
tired of others\' \"identity politics.\"]{.underline} Otherwise
[instructive **queer theorists**]{.underline} like Freeman in her
contribution here or \[End Page 846\] Lauren Berlant 10 [strive to make
family or church automatic signifiers of unqueer conservatism blocking
the progress of queer theory and politics. This has the effect of
**dismissing** a strong tendency among **Black lesbians, gays, and
bisexuals** to identify with church and family as sites of
transformation]{.underline}, actual and potential, [central to their
sexual identity as Blacks and to their **racial identity** as men-loving
men and women-loving women. [Such restlessness]{.mark}]{.underline}
within an identity discipline [[frequently tends]{.mark} also [to
**assume that stigma**]{.mark}, marginality, [and
typing]{.mark}]{.underline}\--mobilized as key terms in Palumbo-Liu\'s
contribution\--[[must dominate the study of the representation
of]{.mark} intersecting [identities, such that it becomes **impossible
to understand**]{.mark}, for instance, the pleasures of identification
that enable **Black sexual minorities** to find in [the]{.mark} Black
church and the Black family,]{.underline} not only in particular cases
but also as institutions, [magnets for progressive \"identity
politics,\" rather than a [**common enemy** that can unite queers across
race, class, and gender.]{.mark}]{.underline} Instead of assuming that
something is astray with anyone who identifies with these
\"reproductive\" institutions, [[we need to]{.mark} investigate and
[theorize the economies of pleasure operating in]{.mark}
such]{.underline} familial and familiar [[identity]{.mark} attractions.
[If we abandon the study of identity **\"inside\" academe**]{.mark} in
the clamor for a new paradigm, [\"out there\" identity politics]{.mark}
and pleasures [will]{.mark} continue and probably [**intensify**. The
more **self-consciously pleased and disturbed** that we become in our
affirmed and **enforced** identities, the **more restless we become**
\"inside\" them.]{.mark}]{.underline} Even intensified
self-consciousness, however, does not seem to get us closer to the dance
of identification as we experience it pleasurably and disturbingly
\"inside\" and \"across\" our bodies\' persons, individually and
collectively considered. [[Our recourse to]{.mark} more **[externalized
structures]{.mark}**\--like the sides of an argument or the solidity of
economic classes\--[promises]{.mark} some [reprieve, but we grow no less
**restless \"outside\" our**]{.mark} personal and **[collective
selves]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as though individuals and their
dis/affectionate affiliations are emptied of their identity, mere
meanings and patterns bereft of that inner motivating vitality. [As
[\"identity politics\"]{.mark} is not dead, [is]{.mark} in fact
[**thriving**, so]{.mark} I\'d suggest [we get on]{.mark} with [making
its theory]{.mark} and practice [thrive in our intellectual
institutions]{.mark}, accompanied by less nervousness and as much
pleasure as possible]{.underline}. Nealon\'s examination of \"affect\"
as queer reception history is a good instance of this. 11 By insisting
on pleasure as a face/t of identification, I realize that I risk
others\' diminishing the political struggle at stake in the disciplining
of identity forms. I would not sacrifice one to the other. [If identity
is always political, the economies of pleasure at work in identification
also **cannot escape** the play for power, in shared or monopolistic
versions]{.underline}. In fact, [it is [the activity of pleasure]{.mark}
on and [across]{.mark} subjects of [identity]{.mark} that [makes
identity]{.mark} such [a forceful vehicle for]{.mark} oppressive
politics, and]{.underline} likewise this pleasure functions in
[[collective]{.underline}]{.mark} \[End Page 847\] [[**assaults against
oppression**.]{.mark} The pleasures of thinking that one belongs to a
superior white race must be reckoned as interfused with the
**obligations, confusions**, fears, and privileges afforded by such a
sweeping, compelling identity]{.underline}. Fortunately for us, the
pleasure in identifying against dominance cannot be delimited by acts of
domination. [[Belonging to a group formed through others\'
**domination** and one\'s own subordination paradoxically affords its
own]{.mark} peculiar [pleasures aimed at **upsetting the norms of
power**]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}** These are the potentially
liberating pleasures of identification that the domineering cannot
rescind, however much they may practice to outlaw or outpace them. Of
identity\'s politics and pleasures there is no end, and as for the
\"identity politics\" besetting us at the present time, we are only now
beginning to learn the rudimentary steps of the dance.

###  AT -- V -- Education

#### Theatrical Performance DA---Policy education is the same political spectacle constantly repeated in an attempt to boost our voices in debate. But an honest assessment of this community reveals that change won't occur through the same old models of activism via "predictability, limits, and ground". Repetition of this maintains a theatrical view of activism that treats the debate space as the stage for a political spectacle. Debate has become an accepted, and therefore ignored, by-product of politics-as-usual. Endorse our evolutionary scholarship to revolutionize the approach to revolution.

#### Repetition DA---Progress in debate is constrained by the status quo via interpretations of policy education. The specific tactics that policy debaters invoke are less important than the emotion these tactics spread. Debate is evolving but the status quo is resilient and tactics are useless, and uninspiring, when repeated. The future of this community already exists, but if you are blinded by old paradigms of "predictability" and "stasis", you'll never see the movement. The only way to discover it is to look within our practices and never protest the same way twice.

worse.]{.underline} In my meditations on revolution, I am increasingly
drawn to a tactical-spiritual explanation of what happens in these
tumultuous moments. I have come to understand that [the role of tactics
is to unleash the collective spirit, a process that hastens a political
miracle.]{.underline} [The people flock to the movement when what was

###  AT -- General Theory

#### Disconnection DA---Our revolutionary theory is the activist playbook which, based on accurate principles, yields social change. Their theory arguments function by promulgating broken theories of change, thus disconnecting our protest from social change. Our actions will fail and our time squandered. Revolution will always be co-opted by traditional norms to build the illusion that dissent is tolerated while discouraging any tactics that might actually change debate.

[[A theory of revolution]{.mark} grants **foresight** regarding whether
a protest will bring change. It [is the only **playbook to
activism**]{.mark} and it must be rewritten by each generation.
[Activism based on accurate principles **yields social
change**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Without a theory of why revolutions
happen and a hypothesis of the behaviours that will hasten the next
uprising, there is no way to distinguish between a destined event and an
ineffectual happening. Lenin made this clear: ["[without a revolutionary
theory there can be no **revolutionary movement**." A repressive status
quo functions by **promulgating broken theories of change**, thereby
disconnecting]{.mark} the link between [protest and change so that our
actions **will fail and our time will be squandered**. Repressive
democracies encourage forms of protest that are **least revolutionary
and most ineffective**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The ideal
situation for [a false democracy]{.underline} is to [have frequent
ineffective protests [that give **the illusion that dissent is
tolerated** while discouraging any tactics that might actually change
the]{.mark} legal [regime.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Coercion DA---Leftist interpretations in debate urge us to go back to class. But standing on the left depends on whose left side we're talking about. It depends on what direction we're facing, and what direction depends on which ideologies and pedagogies we're assuming and affirming. Touting fairness as the stance of the left is just another way of telling everybody else in debate to shut up.

Although in his contribution Eric Lott targets Professor Michaels\'s
comments and his own recent feud with Timothy Brennan (who unfortunately
is not included in this volume) rather than Ken\'s argument, what Eric
says [about \"[left]{.mark} and liberal [fundamentalists]{.mark}\" who
\"simply and somewhat penitently\" [urge us to \"\'go back to]{.mark}
[class\']{.mark}\"]{.underline} could also be directed at Ken\'s
conclusion. Ken writes, \"[[Crafting a political left that does
not]{.mark} merely [reflect]{.mark} existing [racial divisions starts
with]{.mark} the relatively mundane proposition that it is possible
[to]{.mark} make a persuasive [appeal to]{.mark} the given interests of
[working and unemployed]{.mark} [women and men, regardless of
race]{.mark}, in support of a program for economic
justice]{.underline}.\" On this one, I side with Eric, rather than Tim
and Ken. [[Standing]{.mark} [on the left depends on whose left side
we\'re talking about. My left might be your right and vice versa,
because it depends on what direction we\'re facing, and what direction
depends on which identities we\'re assuming and
affirming]{.mark}]{.underline}. Eric adds, \"Even in less dismissive
\[than Tim\'s\] accounts of new social movements based not on class but
on identities formed by histories of injustice, there is a striking a
priori sense of voluntarism about the investment in this cause or that
movement or the other issue\--as though determining the most fundamental
issue were a matter of the writer\'s strength of feeling rather than a
studied or analytical sense of the ever-unstable balance of forces in a
hegemonic bloc at a given moment.\" I agree, but I\'ll risk mangling
what Eric says by putting it more crassly. [[Touting class or \"economic
justice\" as the fundamental stance for left identity is just another
way of telling everybody else to shut up so I can be heard above the
fray. Because of]{.mark} the force of \"[identity politics,\" a leftist
white person would]{.mark} be leery of [claim]{.mark}ing [to lead
Blacks]{.mark} [toward the promised land]{.mark}, a leftist straight man
leery of claiming to lead women or queers]{.underline}, but, for a
number of complex rationalizations, we in the middle class (where all of
us writing here currently reside) still have few qualms about
volunteering to lead, at least theoretically, the working class toward
\"economic justice.\" What Eric calls here \"left fundamentalism,\" I\'d
call, at the risk of sounding harsh, left paternalism. [Of the big
identity groups articulated through \"identity politics,\" [economic
class]{.mark}]{.underline} \[End Page 840\] [[remains the]{.mark} only
[identity where a straight white]{.mark} middle-class [man can still
feel comfortable claiming]{.mark} [himself a leading political voice,
and thus he may sometimes overcompensate by screaming that this is the
only identity that really matters]{.mark}\--which is the same as
[claiming that class is beyond identity]{.mark}]{.underline}. Partly
this is because Marxist theory and Marx himself (a bourgeois
intellectual creating the theoretical practice for the workers\'
revolution) stage the model for working-class identity as a sort of
trans-identification, a magical identity that is transferable to those
outside the group who commit themselves to it wholeheartedly enough. If
we look back, [we realize even this magical quality is not special to a
history of class struggle, as whites during the New Negro movements of
the early twentieth century felt that they were vanguard race leaders
because they had putatively imbibed some essential qualities of
Negroness by cross-identifying with the folk and their
culture]{.underline}. Ironically, Ken\'s conclusion is full of the very
identity concepts that he hopes to transcend by an appeal to a broadly
conceived \"political left.\" As I have already suggested, \"[[the
left\" is an]{.mark} [identity]{.mark} formation [no less than race or
gender or sexuality]{.mark}.]{.underline} Consider the other key terms
of Ken\'s manifesto: \"working and unemployed,\" \"men and women,\"
\"given interests.\" As Professor Michaels indicates, [\"interests\" are
always implicated in identity because they concern the negotiation of
subject positions.]{.underline} Ken\'s recourse to \"men and women,\"
instead of simply \"people\" or some other less gendered term, indicates
to what extent what he\'s referring to is an alliance or coalition.
[Rather than ushering in a post-identity world of pure common interests,
Ken\'s manifesto looks back to the prehistory of \"identity politics,\"
that Edenic moment before we fell into proliferating identities on the
left.]{.underline} What is it that we bring together in coalitions if
not \"men\" and \"women,\" with the identifiable interests that
generally bring them to a common place across their differing identity
circumstances? What are the \"working\" and \"unemployed\" if not
class-based identity formations? Most people on the left would have no
difficulty supporting the general idea in Ken\'s manifesto. [The
[difficulties arise]{.mark} [once we try to move from the manifesto to
politics, from the ideal to specific strategies]{.mark} and tactics for
bringing people into a common \"left.\" [What specific agendas should we
support?]{.mark} Do we abandon affirmative action, or fight for it? Do
we dismiss abortion rights, because that does not directly concern
\"economic justice,\" or fight for it?]{.underline} Do we support
welfare reform or fight against it? Do we ignore racial profiling, which
again may seem distant from the gravity of \"economic justice,\" or
fight it? How do we determine which agendas advance \"economic justice\"
and which ones obstruct it? Do we take a vote? Do we count who\'s
against, who\'s for? Do we lobby those in our own neighborhoods, which
are by and large still segregated by race and class? Such \[End Page
841\] nuts-and-bolts questions are the nuts and bolts of politics, and
they are exactly the kinds of issues that \"identity politics\" handles
effectively. Those of us who live in upscale college communities that
are relatively racially integrated can sometimes forget, I think, that
we are racial-identity exceptions: [[any attempt to arrange a
common]{.mark} [interest in class across race will crash]{.mark}
head-on]{.underline} (that face metonym again) [[into]{.mark} the walls
of [racially segregated groups within]{.mark} the working
[classes]{.mark}, and the diverse cultures that they self-consciously
espouse.]{.underline}

#### Fearmongering DA---Wake up and prepare yourself! You are a partisan in the Revolution of debate. The situation has changed. The "oppressors" who "ruin debate" are no longer localizable---they aren't critical debaters but a structure of immaterial flows of security and global capitalism. The battle ground of our revolution experiences a fear of the invasion of non-normative practices and acts to totally surveil it through framework.

[[**Wake up and prepare yourself**! You are a partisan in the
**Revolution**: a war that has been raging since the people first
demanded democracy]{.mark} over 121 generations ago. The earliest
records of our rebellion are 3,646 years old and document when
**protesters toppled** a pharaoh during the Middle Kingdom of Ancient
Egypt.]{.underline} In an ancient papyrus known as The Dialogue of
Ipuwer and the Lord of All, written between 1980 BC and 1630 BC, an
eponymous spectator records one of our first successful revolutions: "O,
yet the rich are in lamentation, the poor are in joy; every town says,
'Let's drive out the strong among us!' For look, [things have been done
which have not been done before...the removal of the king by
wretches]{.underline}. For look, it has come to rebellion." [When our
revolution first started, a cornucopia of **civilizations** reigned,
each with its own colorful set of beliefs, languages, semiotics,
religions and fighting methods.]{.underline} Many societies were
matriarchal. Some were egalitarian. The greatest cities of the ancient
world (Luxor, Athens, Alexandria, Rome...) were minuscule compared with
the smallest of today's megalopolises. If the people found the local
situation intolerable, they could act locally to rectify the problem.
One telling example of how power functioned before the consolidation of
peoples comes to us [from a nomadic tribe in Africa, where the chief's
power was so **precarious** that if he ruled with too heavy a hand, his
people would desert him in the night. [**The situation has changed**.
With the consolidation of power into]{.mark} kingdoms and then
[nation-states and]{.mark} now into the [immaterial financial flows of
**global corporate-capitalism**, humans are becoming more **culturally
alike**]{.mark} each generation. [The oppressor is no longer]{.mark}
local or [**localizable**. The tyrant is increasingly a **flow of
capital**]{.mark} **and [not a human person]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} The
growing cultural sameness of humanity aids the transmission of our
**insurrection**.]{.underline} Although it may seem that power keeps
increasing despite protest, there are signs that a might reversal is
coming. Everyday peo[ple have the necessary ingredients for the coming
transformation of society: the labour, creativity and **spirit of
humanity**. [The **battle ground of our revolution** is a world composed
of seven billion humans]{.mark}]{.underline} connected by air travel, a
network of fibre-optic undersea cables and orbiting satellites. [[Fear
of **total surveillance and invasions**]{.mark} of privacy [is
growing.]{.mark}]{.underline} Still, technologically adept activists can
find ways to communicate freely with one another from every place on
Earth. [Protest is politics by other means]{.underline}, to paraphrase
the Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz's famous definition
of war. [[Protest is]{.mark} a form of [**warfare** to the extent that
activists set out to achieve]{.mark} strategic [political goals using
**unconventional methods**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Social
movements are non-violent armies whose protests have political
consequences]{.underline}. As in war, [activism does not always obey the
law; [revolutionary activism seeks to inaugurate a new legal
regime.]{.mark}]{.underline} Gandhi was no less a warrior than Napoleon.
Each wrought major geopolitical shifts in his lifetime using previously
unknown techniques of warfare. Gandhi demonstrated that non-violence can
be highly effective when confronting a foreign colonial state. He showed
that satyagrahis, a trained army of non-violent warriors, confronting a
power with dramatic military superiority could engender the world's
sympathy. Despite the successes of Martin Luther King Jr.'s campaign to
break America's segregated South, subsequent struggle have shown us that
1960s-era non-violence alone is not enough and that [corporatist
democracies are becoming insidiously adept at **defusing public
protest** without responding to demands democratically.]{.underline}
[The people are locked in a **tactical arms race with power**, and each
advance in protest is met with a counter-advance in repression.
Activists surmount this danger by working to develop **tactical
innovations** that emerge and grow exponentially so that our enemy's
**defences are overwhelmed** before they can mobilize for the
counterattack. Winning the people's war will require more than just a
unified theory of revolution. It will also need an understanding of the
tactics that have defined the history of protest.]{.underline}

#### Plantation DA---In the rules, numbering and representation are turned against those seeking fairness. What "counts for" Blackness is malleable to those who determine traditional community norms. These rules of the game were around long before---tied to systems of counting enslaved persons. They endeavor to make the rules work for the marginalized, they think that if traditional rules can never dismantle tradition, then they can be used to partition the game "fairly". A new revolutionary politic of debate must place marginalized perspectives in the halls of power---the realm of constructing debate's rules.

For Ken, [[\"identity politics\" is suspect because it]{.mark} fails
[not only a test of rational argumentation but]{.mark} also a test [of
effective political]{.mark} [strategy.]{.mark}]{.underline} Ken
perceptively points out the nonrational aspects of numbering and
representation [[in \"identity politics,\"]{.underline}]{.mark} how
[[numbering and representation are]{.mark} so [easily turned against
those seeking a fair hearing in the courts]{.mark}, assemblies,
corporate offices, and factory floors [where power is]{.mark}
[arbitrated]{.mark}.]{.underline} As he demonstrates, [[what \"counts
for\" blackness]{.mark} or some other identity [is malleable]{.mark} not
only to the disempowered but also [to]{.mark} [the powerful, who can
manipulate everything]{.mark} from census data to racial profiling [as a
form of \"community policing.\"]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Numbering
and]{.mark} [representation]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, were not
invented by \"identity politics.\" They [[were the rules of the
game]{.mark} in politics [long before]{.mark} such a term could have
even been imagined. [The question of how to count enslaved
persons]{.mark} for the purposes of determining the Congressional
representation of the states [was a Constitutional dilemma]{.mark}
because numbering and representation were grounding principles
[of]{.mark} [liberal republicanism.]{.mark}]{.underline} As Patricia
Williams has so eloquently pointed out, we are still attempting to
overturn the chain reactions put into place when the Founding Fathers
decided their compromise by fractioning each captive person into
three-fifths of a human body. 8 \"[[Identity politics\" endeavors to
make the rules]{.mark} of the game [work for the dispossessed]{.mark},
rather than against them. It may be the case that [the Founding
Fathers\' rules can never dismantle the]{.mark} [Fathers\' house,
but]{.mark} perhaps [they can be used to partition the rooms of the
house fairly]{.mark}]{.underline}. More to the point, [numbering and
representation are not just some set of arbitrary game rules rigged by a
select group of elite men, although they have operated as such for a
very long time. [They are]{.mark}]{.underline}, more fundamentally,
[[the]{.mark} only [rules]{.mark} that [we currently have for attempting
to construct]{.mark} governance, [society, and]{.mark} economics on
democratic [principles.]{.mark} There can be no concept of democracy
without some method of representation, and there can be no
representation without counting populations and finding ways to make
representatives accountable to them.]{.underline} Unless we have visions
of stateless bodies dancing in our heads, [[the body politic]{.mark}, if
it is [to be radically democratized, must be made radically accountable
to the people]{.mark} currently [at the margins]{.mark} and bottoms of
power [by helping to place those]{.mark} very [people in the halls of
power.]{.mark}]{.underline} If socialism and other Marxist-influenced
agendas are forms of radical democratization, and I\'d argue that they
are, they necessarily \[End Page 839\] must rely on principles of
numbering and representation, even if these principles are transformed
by a revolutionary practice not yet materialized. To underplay this, as
Soviet Communism certainly did, is to flirt with the very modes of
tyranny\--an old-fashioned word that needs to be resuscitated\--that
radical democratization sets out to topple. [The struggle for a
radically democratized society, governance, and economy dictates that
numbering and representation, the hallmarks of \"identity politics,\"
will always be a part of our politics because, as far as we can see any
future, numbering and representation are an intrinsic and thus necessary
practice constituting democratization itself.]{.underline}

#### Interpolation DA---Given a lack of understanding our revolutionary scholarship in this community, framework debaters must impute norms onto us. When they cannot deal with what we stand for, they deal with the disembodies parts that connect us to a larger abstract rule in debate, categories readily available to process deviant bodies. Their framework arguments search and try to classify us into rules we somehow broke, classifying based on their own limited experiences and understandings.

[[Those]{.mark} contributors [I have not met in person]{.mark},
therefore, [must]{.mark} necessarily [possess face/ts of
identity]{.mark}]{.underline}\--metonymic faces\--[more or less seeable,
knowable, imaginable, [readable to me.]{.mark}]{.underline} This is
because, [[given the lack of such \"evidence\"]{.mark} supposedly
offered by the actual person\'s face, in the effort to reckon what they
are saying and why, [I]{.mark} necessarily [must impute]{.mark} some
kind of [identity to who they are and why they say what they\'re
saying.]{.mark}]{.underline} All of these contributors I have met in
print, as we like to say, and the more print that I\'ve read by them,
the more cohesive\--the less inchoate\--is my sense of an identity for
them. 3 [[My identification of them is]{.underline}]{.mark} not merely a
projection, although we cannot disallow a degree of this, but more
aptly, it is a matter of [[a dialectic between what they project to me
and what I take from that projection.]{.mark} All of this is to assert
that [the most basic]{.mark} [act]{.mark} of \"seeing\" or \"knowing\"
or [\"imaging\" or \"reading\" is]{.mark} itself [a]{.mark} kind [of
face-off]{.mark} that we now call \"identity politics,\" but that was no
doubt called by other names before]{.underline}. And this is so not
merely because we live in a moment in which what we call \"identity
politics\" is rife, or is anticipated as waning because too fluent.
[[When we cannot deal with persons face to face, we]{.mark} always [deal
with face/ts, the disembodied parts that connect them to larger
abstract]{.mark}, but no less material and actual, [categories readily
available to us. When we do meet]{.mark} someone [face to face,]{.mark}
[we still deal only with face/ts]{.mark}, with bodied parts [that we can
classify according to what makes sense to us from our own
limited]{.mark} identity-[experiences.]{.mark}]{.underline} Identities
are not like the faces in facets; they are face/ts. When we therefore
talk about the politics of identity\--no matter how much more
sophisticated we try to make it sound\--we are really talking about the
politics of our face/ts.

#### Identity Politics DA---The commonality tying the norms of traditional debate together can uncover atrocious acts committed. Just as the identity of "Texan" has accumulated countless daily gestures of friendliness, Texanness unspeaks uncounted crimes of imperial theft and enslavement. The authority we collectively invest into current community identities like "framework" is the same authority that grants us the right to classify revolutionary debaters into "fair" and "not fair". The slightest deviation from this identity induces the great discomfort and othering.

[The most innocuous [commonality tying faces]{.mark} or places [together
can uncover]{.mark} or take cover in the most ordinary or [the most
atrocious]{.mark} [acts committed]{.mark} by one set of humans against
another, [just as behind the identity \"Texan\" has accumulated,]{.mark}
on the one hand, [countless daily gestures of]{.mark} Texan
[friendliness]{.mark}]{.underline} (\"tejas\" or \"techas\" probably
meant \"friend\" or ally in the native Indian tongue of the Caddo,
we\'re taught in grade school). 2 On the other hand, [[Texanness]{.mark}
bespeaks and [unspeaks uncounted crimes of imperial theft, massacres of
Indians]{.mark} and Mexicans, [enslavement]{.mark} and lynchings [of
Negroes, exploitation of Third World labor, and murderous
brutalities]{.mark} devoted to policing a make-believe national border
with Latin America. [The authority]{.mark} that [we collectively invest
in a nationalizing identity like \"Texan\" is]{.mark} more or less [the
same authority that grants us the]{.mark} commonplace [right to see
classifications]{.mark} and commonalities in others\'
faces.]{.underline} In fact, we always detach from a person\'s self a
metonymic face\--the disembodied \"face\" that lives on in the more
abstract sense of \"facet\"\--every time we encounter that person\'s
remnant in an article of clothing, a picture, a reminiscence, a snippet
of \[End Page 830\] gossip, a fantasy, a recorded voice, a manuscript, a
printed text. Etymologically speaking, \"facet\" is a personification
that attributes to the smooth planar surfaces of small objects\--gems,
stones, bones, insect eyes\--a diminutive simulacrum of the human face.
Ironically, the planiform surfaces of a diamond or of a fly\'s eye look
like \"facelets\"\--little blank faces\--to us exactly because they seem
to mimic the infinitely reproducible form that we expect to see, that we
hope to find, fronting and heading every human body. [[The slightest
deviation from this]{.mark} simulacral [form]{.mark}, whether fantastic
or accidental\--a third eye or a cut-off nostril\--[induces the greatest
discomfort in the observer because it disturbs a sense of that
person\'s]{.mark}]{.underline} (the observed\'s and the observer\'s)
[[identity both within a]{.mark} local [group]{.mark}]{.underline}
(family, race, gender, nation) [and within the universal human group. To
deviate slightly from this facial form, with its idealizing tendencies,
is almost to be two-faced.]{.underline} After being invested in these
vaguely personified material objects, the term \"facet\" then comes to
signify an immaterial abstraction, meaning something like \"aspect,\" an
essential observable component or member of something larger.
[[\"Facet,\"]{.mark} then, [takes us]{.mark} from the dimpled,
penetrable features of the actual human face through the hard, smooth
materiality of impenetrable objects (ultimate others) [to the
abstractions that constitute human identity-formation as
\"othering.\"]{.mark} Identity is our insistence on finding the facets
in the actual faces of individuals]{.underline} (including ourselves)
[whom we encounter in person and out of person]{.underline} (in print,
photography, histories, fiction, legend, memory, gossip, imagination,
and so on). Significantly, these facets of identity can be more \"real\"
or \"present\" to us than the material faces of individuals facing us on
a crowded subway car. And why shouldn\'t they be? I am told that I\'m
the \"spittin\' image\" (a colloquial corruption of \"spit and image\")
of my father. [[I]{.mark} often [see the spittin\' image of]{.mark} [my
\"blood relatives\" in Blacks]{.mark} whom I encounter far from home. I
see the spittin\' image [of movie stars in ordinary people]{.mark} on
the street. Walking around London, I see the spittin\' image of members
of the royal family everywhere. Whether resulting from a trick of the
mind\'s eye or from actual meta/physical resonances forced upon the mind
by the eye, [I cannot deny the constant recurrence of such facial echoes
as a commonplace déjà vu.]{.mark}]{.underline} [And [upon such]{.mark}
facial [echoes res]{.mark}t the mountains of [racial and other identity
ideologies,]{.mark} the weight of which \"identity politics\" seeks to
lift]{.underline}. Our fate is not that presence is always already
beyond our metaphysical grasp, as Jacques Derrida would have it, but
instead that we can handle only the physics of presences, even when
caught within that gap between the personal encounter and the person\'s
absence\--the gap that we variously call touching, seeing, knowing,
imaging, or reading. \[End Page 831\]

#### Revolutionizing Revolution DA---Debate is broken and we know it. We believed that debaters could gain sovereign protection through repression through the consensual norms of debate. Education---that was the meaning of this activity. Not anymore. When faced with unpredictable arguments, debaters fall back into unquestioning cynicism to desperately sustain our illusion of stability. A new activism is desperately needed. Until then, following those traditional norms only follows a predictable pattern that debaters are eager to control. The conditions for revolution are now present: inequality for innovative scholarship, corruption among those in power in debate, and the excessive use of force against rebels like us who are against the grain. These old tactics must be abandoned---they are leading us astray.

[[**Protest is broken** and the people know it
worldwide]{.mark}.]{.underline} As the activist and filmmaker Astra
Taylor puts it, "We've had some of the biggest marches and protests in
public outpourings in history in the last fifteen years, and it doesn't
just magically have a political consequence." [The failure of
**contemporary activism** is good news. [The ingredients for **global
revolution** are now here.]{.mark} Democracy functions because its
citizenry believes that protest,]{.underline} if performed properly and
when no other redress is available, [is effective. [The possibility of
revolution]{.mark} [keeps **politicians beholden to the people.**
Without]{.mark} our faith in the assumption [that]{.mark} elected
representatives can be ousted by a collective uprising,]{.underline} and
without our elected representatives' fear that protests can end their
political career, [[democracy would be tyranny]{.mark}.]{.underline} If
social change through collective protest is impossible, democracy has
been negated. [[The]{.mark} [defeat of Occupy]{.mark}]{.underline} Wall
Street, a once-in-a-generation uprising, [[was]{.mark} also [the end of
**our illusion of democracy**]{.mark}.]{.underline} A generation's faith
in the legitimacy of representative democracy was shaken when the
people's encampments, a manifestation of participatory democracy, were
evicted and our demands ignored. And [the legitimacy of contemporary
activism was **shattered** too. It is too easy to blame the police.
Activists must also acknowledge our **role in the defeat**: the theories
guiding our methods of protest were faulty.]{.underline} The spirit of
Adbusters' initial tactical briefing was beautiful and inspiring, but
the hypothesis that a people's assembly could end the influence of money
in democracy just as it had deposed autocrats in Tunisia and Egypt
proved inaccurate. Likewise, an adherence to the ideology of
prefigurative anarchism, the notion that the people must build the world
we want to live in rather than make demands of the existing reality,
blinded many founding Occupiers in New York City. The refusal, and
inability, to reach consensus on "our one demand" and develop complex
decision-making procedures meant that the movement could never move
toward legitimate sovereignty, political negotiation and a transfer of
power-a naïve mistake. [Stuck between two competing theories of
revolution-performative public protests designed to sway global opinion
versus the creation of autonomous spaces that manifest popular
sovereignty-we failed to realize that both approaches were
false.]{.underline} The Adbusters tactical briefing was a long shot, a
gamble that succeeded because we were willing to risk it all. Time was
ripe and our wish was granted. We conjured a social movement par
excellence. And for twenty-eight days the storm was perfect. A
one-in-a-million lightning strike. Occupy's existence tested everything
our generation had been taught about activism. Occupy interrogated the
relationship between everyday people and their elected government. We
hypothesized that we live in a representative, responsive democracy that
ultimately bows, out of self-restraint, to the demands of the people.
[[We believed that the]{.mark} [people could gain]{.mark} sovereign
[**protection from police repression** by]{.mark} enacting collective,
[consensual democracy. We thought no government could resist the]{.mark}
[**united chorus** of its citizens]{.mark} expressing themselves with
democratic fervor. [That was the meaning of democracy**. Not anymore.**
When]{.mark} our encampment were smashed and [our momentum was reversed,
many people]{.mark}]{.underline} blamed the police or the corporatocracy
or the Occupiers or **[[fell back into unquestioning
cynicism]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Instead, the assumptions we held about
activism and how to achieve political change were to blame Activists
have not been passive. For decades, we have tried every tactic to shift
the course of our governments. [[We have]{.mark} [voted, written
editorials and]{.mark} manifestos, donated money, held
signs]{.underline}, protested in marches, blocked streets, shared links,
signed petitions, held workshops, knitted scarves, learned to farm,
turned off the television, programmed apps, engaged in direct action,
committed vandalism, launched legal challenges against pipelines...[and
[occupied the financial district. All this has **been for**]{.mark}
[**naught**. A new]{.mark} approach to [activism and]{.mark} a new kind
of [protest are **desperately needed.** Occupy inauguarated the **end of
protest**, a period in which activism]{.mark} [must be
reinvented]{.mark}-realigned with its spiritual calling-to be effective
once again. [The end of protest is a natural part of the **cycle of
social change**]{.mark}.]{.underline} And I suspect it won't be long
before a novel form of social activism breaks out once again. [[Until
then, ineffective protests will]{.mark}]{.underline} continue (every
social earthquake, like Occupy, has its aftershocks), but these isolated
events won't spiral into revolution or shift the course of history.
Rather, they will [[follow a **predictable pattern** that the police
are]{.mark} well [prepared to control]{.mark}.]{.underline} Or they will
chase after misguided goals, such as larger crowds in the streets, that
are irrelevant to the likelihood of revolutionary social change. [[The
end of protest heralds]{.mark} the coming transformation of activism: a
time when the tactics used, and the **underlying theory** guiding our
actions, undergoes [a]{.mark} sudden [paradigm shift away from
materialism and toward a **higher** **purpose**, giving birth to a truly
**effective movement**.]{.mark}]{.underline} We live in dangerous times,
when large-scale social transformation is necessary. Scientists,
technologists, mystics, artists and teachers agree: socio-political
change in our lifetime is crucial for the survival of the human species.
The constructive failure of Occupy Wall Street teaches the people to
invent new forms of protest in order to break out of the stagnation of
the period between revolutions. [The end of protest is a call to
revolutionize activism. [The preconditions for revolution are
present:]{.mark} income [inequality]{.mark}]{.underline}, disaffection
of intellectuals who are burdened by educational debt, [[**corruption**
among elites]{.underline}]{.mark} and inefficiency in government, a
ruling class that has lost self-confidence, looming financial collapse,
[[and the]{.mark} [**excessive use of force against rebels** whenever
protests occur]{.mark}.]{.underline} But power has adapted to the
approaches that have dominated activism for the past half-century or
more. [[The old tactics must be abandoned. The old assumptions]{.mark}
about how change is made [are **leading us
astray**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} This is a problem for everyone
who wishes for a better world in his or her lifetime. The solution is
innovation. And the reason for optimism is that when activists innovate
their tactics, revolutionary moments are often not far behind.

#### Fiat Divestment DA---Progress in debate is constrained by traditional status quo norms. Debaters flock to the safety of pre-establish norms when they are challenged. They believe anything is possible when a sense of collective approval rises among the community. The specific content that their interpretation employs is less important than the emotion it spreads. Debate is evolving but the status quo is resilient and activism is useless, and uninspiring when repeated through the same mechanisms of traditional debate. This community's future already exists, but if you are blinded by traditional paradigms of activism, you'll never see the movement.

[There is an **eternal force** within humanity that strives **toward

spirit. At [most times]{.mark} in history, [the human spirit is
**constrained by the status quo**. When]{.mark}]{.underline}, every once
in a while, [[activists stumble across a new way of approaching the
struggle, the status]{.mark} [quo is **upended**]{.mark}, for better or
worse.]{.underline} In my meditations on revolution, I am increasingly
drawn to a tactical-spiritual explanation of what happens in these
tumultuous moments. I have come to understand that [the role of tactics
is to unleash the collective spirit, a process that hastens a political
miracle.]{.underline} [[The people flock to the movement when what was
previously believed to be impossible **suddenly seems within
reach.**]{.underline}]{.mark} Each of these episodes of protest, drawn
from two thousand years of revolution, demonstrates that spirit-the
immaterial force within us-is the deciding factor in an uprising. Put
simply, the people join the movement they believe will win. [[Anything
is possible when a sense of **collective faith**]{.mark} **in victory
[rises among the people]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} In the final
analysis, [[the specific tactics that activists employ are less
important than the **emotion** these tactics

tactics erase fear from participants and are novel and surprising from
the perspective of authorities. Generally speaking, the tactics that
fulfill these two requirements are audacious. The moment the people
become disillusioned with a tactic, it fails. [Similarly, as soon as
authorities **understand the pattern** of a protest ritual it is
defeated. [The balance of power is shifting toward the people, but the
status quo is **resilient** and tactics are **useless, and uninspiring,
when repeated**. ]{.mark}]{.underline} [[The future of activism already
exists.]{.mark} However, [if you are **blinded by old paradigms of
activism**, you'll never see the movement]{.mark} that is about to break
out.]{.underline} [The next protest tactic that will release the human
spirit and unleash a **global social movement** is out there right now
waiting to be seen. The only way to discover it is to look within and
**never protest the same way** **twice**.]{.underline}

#### Static Thought DA---Fitting into the form of debate has no impact on whether social progress in this activity will succeed. Now what do you do? Framework debaters do nothing, twiddle their thumbs by reifying the norms of debate, and wait for us to bring the revolution through our unorthodox scholarship. It doesn't matter if we sway the entire community, protesting becomes a way to express ourselves. As long as we perpetuate practices from our inner selves, our every action is revolution making.

Weekly and Folha de Sao Paulo. Widely recognized as a pioneer of social

[Assume that human action, [the form of protest or **organizational
style**, has no]{.mark} significant [impact on whether a movement will
succeed]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} To recap, all that matters is
that a contesting group exists prior to, and continues protesting
during, a world-historic crisis. If these two simple conditions are met,
there is a 4 percent probability that the contesting group will be
successful. To simplify matters, let's say that a world-historic crisis
is indicated by a Food Price Index above 210. Let's go further and
propose that the outcome of the revolution is not up to human will, and
therefore total inaction when the Food Price Index exceeds 210 will have
the same chances of hastening a revolutionary victory as action. [**[Now
what do you do]{.mark}** to change the world? How do you act? A few
[people may]{.mark} choose to [do nothing, **twiddle their thumbs**
and]{.mark} just [wait for the revolution to
happen.]{.mark}]{.underline} The German philosopher Friederich
[[Nietzsche]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, once [[observed that a person
would rather will something than nothing, and]{.mark} I suspect [the
majority would]{.mark} still choose to [act.]{.mark}]{.underline} And if
choosing a tactic based on effectiveness is not possible, because all
forms of protest are equally effective in a purely structuralist world
view, the best course of action would be to choose the tactics with
superior secondary benefits. [[If protest **can't hasten revolution**,
activists]{.mark} are free to [protest in ways that bring happiness or
vibrant]{.mark} community or **beautiful [art]{.mark}**[. Protest no
longer needs to]{.mark} be a public declaration intended to [**sway
authorities**;]{.mark} instead, [protesting becomes a way of
**expressing one's true self**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [What do you do
when organizing a global march, **painting an urban mural** or feeding
the hungry people during a world crisis have equal chances of sparking
social change? You [choose the action that **speaks to you**]{.mark}-the
action most **authentic** to becoming yourself. In a way, this exactly
what we were all doing during **Occupy Wall Street**: [the
**creativity** of our actions-from consensus-based assemblies]{.mark}
and livestreaming to emergent collective behaviours-[was the **essence
of our protest**. As long as we acted out of our inner selves, our every
action was **revolution making**.]{.mark}]{.underline} In a situation
where inaction is equivalent to action when judged from the perspective
of the probability of success, [activists are free to invest any action
with potency.]{.underline} Perhaps any collective action can achieve the
transcendence of protest if exercised during a moment of world-historic
crisis. This possibility gestures toward how new tactics come into being
spontaneously. And it helps us understand anomalous protest tactics such
as the Ghost Dance of 1890, a prophetic circle-dancing ritual performed
by indigenous people in North America that originated in a bid to hasten
the return of their sovereignty. The Ghost Dance was explicitly
understood by its participants as a ritual with political consequences.
The dance was effective enough to warrant being violently suppressed by
the U.S. government. A rational voluntarist would be hard pressed to
explain why dancing in a circle far away from cities would be a threat
to a government. A structuralist activist, however, understands that a
protest does not need to target authorities to be effective, it need
only be recognized as protest at the right time.

#### Imagination DA---The ground of our struggle is the shared pool of norms and desires of "fairness and education" that shape how this community manifests. We can't conceive a sane future for this activity because our collective imagination has been usurped by traditional norms. The imperative of our revolutionary struggle is to unshackle debate. Our culture is infected by a virus, a disease that keeps us distracted by illusions of "fiat, predictability, ground, and education". And we didn't contract this illness by mistake.

As activists of the future, [[the ground of our struggle is]{.mark}
**humanity's mental environment**-our collective unconscious, [the
**shared pool of**]{.mark} **myths, [dreams and]{.mark}** [**desires**
that shape how the world manifests.]{.mark} The future of protest begins
with the **realization** that the **external wo**rld is a reflection of
our interior world. [What we see is a **mirror of ourselves**. Our
communal reality is constructed through our **shared
culture**]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}** And every time we
experience a commercial interjection, a fatal lie lodges in our world
view. The true danger of pervasive advertising is the damage it does to
our *mental ecology*, the inexplicable interior world that is uniquely
human. [A clean mental environment is an indispensable ingredient to a
thriving civilization.]{.underline} [Perhaps [we cannot conceive a sane
future because our collective imagination has been **usurped by
advertisers**]{.mark}, money worshippers and commercialism.]{.underline}
We are in a double bind. Kicking consumerism out of our heads and
finding solutions to the global problems humanity faces become the same
struggle. [[The]{.mark} strategic [imperative of our **revolutionary
struggle**-our collective uprising to **unshackle** our spirits]{.mark}
and revive our imagination-[comes to view. Our culture is infected by
a]{.mark} commercial [**virus**, a disease that keeps us distracted by
**illusions** while the world collapses. And we did **not** **contract
the illness by mistake**.]{.mark}]{.underline} For decades, corporations
have consciously and strategically pursued the commercialization of
culture. Their winning strategy has been to integrate advertising into
public culture. By snatching the role of funding culture away from the
people and their governments, [[corporations have made us **dependent on
"free" information**]{.mark}, entertainment, services and software
[that]{.mark} are subsidized by advertising and [come at **grave cost**
to our]{.mark} psyches and our [world.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Toxin DA---When our minds are polluted by the traditional norms of debate, and our imaginations stunted by toxic "fiat, education, and fairness", we are unable to conceive of a better way of organizing this community. We don't see the revolutionary potential that is disappearing around us. In our struggle, the most significant battles will be fought within our collective norms. Those who combat the incessant flow of standards, interpretations and violations that invade debate, are the partisans of evolution. To defeat a normative enemy that has lodged itself in our heads, the revolution creates collective events that "unblind" debaters en masse.

[**[Activists of the future]{.mark}** thus [must be]{.mark} **mental
environmentalists**, as [concerned with the]{.mark} health of our
**[interior world]{.mark}**]{.underline} as we are about the natural
world. [Mental environmentalism means working from the assumption that
[there is a connection between the]{.mark} level of [**pollution in our
minds** and the]{.mark} prevalence of [pollution in the
world]{.mark}.]{.underline} At the most basic level, [this is imperative
because [when our minds are **polluted by commercialism**, and our
imaginations stunted by **toxic advertising**, we are **unable to
conceive** of a better way of organizing society. Our creativity
declines with the increase of **info-toxins**. Our **imagination
atrophies** as our behavior mimics what we see]{.mark} on the
screens.]{.underline} At more complex level, as the subjectivist theory
of revolution suggests, [our mental environment dictates to a certain
extent which beings manifest in our **physical
environment**.]{.underline} Naming calls beings into existence. And when
we cannot name the species of trees, animals and insects around us but
we recognize instantly the commercial logos, the only beings that will
manifest (the only beings we will perceive) are corporate owned,
artificial and consumerist. [[We don't see the world that is
**disappearing around us**.]{.underline} [In our **global struggle** to
liberate humanity, the most significant battles will be
fought]{.underline}]{.mark} [on the spiritual level-inside our heads,
[within our]{.mark} imagination and deep in our [**collective
unconscious**.]{.mark} The three thousand advertising messages each of
us is exposed to per day are snares in a **spiritual war** to keep us
from imagining another world into existence. [Those who **fight the
incessant flow** of brands, slogans and jingles that]{.mark} inundate
our cities, [invade our homes]{.mark} and glimmer on our screens [are
heroic partisans safeguarding the]{.mark} keystone of thriving
civilizations-[human spirit. Without spirit and creativity, **humanity
is lost**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [The future of activism is a struggle to
capture the imagination of humanity.]{.underline} [[To defeat an enemy
that has **lodged itself in our heads**, our people's revolution builds
upwards from]{.mark} the individual]{.underline} to the family,
community and finally humanity. [It begins in [our psyche with an
**epiphany** and it grows each time we extol the truth]{.mark} of our
fearless revolution. [The essence of revolution]{.mark} in the
twenty-first century [is to]{.mark} replicate our **spiritual
awakening** in others.]{.underline} Our ultimate objective is to
catalyze an awakening that rolls from city to city with sufficient speed
and force to overwhelm the establishment. Richard Dawkins, the
evolutionary biologist who coined the word "meme" in his book The
Selfish Gene, describes this cultural unit's potency: "When you plant a
fertile meme in my mind you literally parasitize my brain, turning it
into a vehicle for the meme's propagation in just the same way that a
virus may parasitize the genetic mechanism of a host cell." [We use
social memes to [create collective events that "**unblind" people en**
**masse**]{.mark}, inviting miraculous **divine intervention** into the
world.]{.underline}

#### Disease DA---Debate is injustice but protest is the solution. Evolution is crucial to a healthy community because evolution drives social progress. No freedom has ever been given freely. Our protest releases the energy necessary for breaking out of old social patterns and shaping the future of this activity. We respond to adversity by attacking the disease which causes inequality in debate rather than the mere symptom, i.e. our revolutionary response.

[[You were born into]{.mark} a world in which **[injustice]{.mark} and
inequality reign**. [Activism is the **solution**. When positive social
change is necessary but **blocked**, suffering **grows**]{.mark} and so
too does the social **pressure to break through**. [Activism is
**crucial to a healthy society** because revolutions drive social
progress]{.mark};]{.underline} as Karl Marx observed, "revolutions are
the locomotives of history." [[Nearly all the good in this world is the
result of]{.mark} hard-fought [**protest**. Without]{.mark} disobedience
that **spiraled into [full-blown insurrection]{.mark}**[, there would be
no democracy]{.mark}. Every right you enjoy today was the result of past
activism.]{.underline} As Wendell Phillips, the American abolitionist,
said in 1848, "Revolution is the only thing, the only power, that ever
worked out freedom for any people." In other word, [[no freedom has ever
been **given freely**.]{.mark} Protest is the price we pay for
democracy. **Progress is made by protest**.]{.underline} Since early
modernity, and with increasing tempo following the eighteenth-century
French Revolution, [[protests have inaugurated **new phases of the human
saga.**]{.mark}]{.underline} Revolutions-what Victor Hugo calls "the
larva of civilization"-are vital for the healthy renewal of the social
order. [[Protest releases the energy necessary for **breaking out of old
social patterns**]{.mark}, and revolutions cement these new patterns
into daily life. Protests]{.underline}, like wars and disruptive
technological inventions, [are agents of social change. Revolutions are
signs of **history being made**. [Striving toward]{.mark} [revolution is
one]{.mark} of the few [way]{.mark}s [that]{.mark} seemingly [powerless
people can **shape the future**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Protests are vital
to political, social and cultural health. Examining social movements,
the sociologist Hank Johnston calls them "integral to keeping political
elites attentive." [[Suppressing protest is]{.mark} ultimately [more
**dangerous**]{.mark} to the suppressor than the people,]{.underline}
and revolutions are close at hand whenever power ends the possibility of
effective protest. [The delay of a necessary revolution is a primary
source of transformational violence]{.underline}. Or as John F. Kennedy
famously put it: "[Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will
make **violent revolution inevitable**."]{.underline} Recognition of the
positive and productive role of protest has underpinned American
democracy since its founding. Thomas Jefferson, the primary author of
the Declaration of Independence and America's third president, was
candid about the value of rebellion. "I hold that a little rebellion now
and then is a good thing, and as necessary in the political world as
storms in the physical," he wrote in a letter to James Madison in the
years preceding the French Revolution. Jefferson then advised Madison,
who played a significant role in drafting the United States Constitution
and the United States Bill of Rights, to endorse only moderate
punishments for insurrections and uprisings: "Honest republican
governors \[should be\] so mild in their punishment of rebellions, as
not to discourage them too much." In a letter to another recipient,
Jefferson exclaims, "God forbid we should be twenty years without a
rebellion. What country can preserve its liberties If the rulers are not
warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of
resistance?" In fact, this lax view toward punishing protest was
widespread among the Founding Fathers. [[Liberty depends on
resistance]{.mark} even when, [**especially** when, resistance threatens
to **overthrow the status quo**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Not just in the
United States is the history of democracy the history of revolution.
"[Representative democracy was not established through a prolonged
process of peaceful reform but rather by revolutionary
means]{.underline}," explains the historian Brian Roper in The History
of Democracy. He continues: "A series of revolutionary upheavals...from
the first Dutch revolt in 1565 to the end of the American Civil War in
1865 , transformed previously existing states and established
representative democracy." In the words of U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Robert Houghwout Jackson, writing during the Cold War, the occasional
necessity of revolution is "an old American belief." Jackson writes, "We
cannot ignore the fact that our own government originated in
[revolution, and is legitimate only if overthrow by force can sometimes
be **justified**]{.underline}... The men who led the struggle forcibly
to overthrow lawfully constituted British authority found moral support
by asserting a natural law under which their revolution was justified,
and they bravely proclaimed their belief in the document basic to our
freedom." The nineteenth president, Ulysses S. Grant, writes in blunt
terms: ["[the right of]{.mark} [Revolution is]{.mark} an
**[inherent]{.mark}** one. When people are oppressed by their
government, it is a natural right they enjoy to relieve themselves of
the oppression if they are strong enough, either by withdrawing from it,
or by **overthrowing i**t and **substituting a government more
acceptable**. [As complex societies evolve, social inequalities manifest
that lead to **imbalance**]{.mark}, injustice and conflict.]{.underline}
Left unresolved, these societal tensions build toward a dangerous
conflagration and ultimately herald the transformation of the social
order. [[The eruption of protests]{.mark}, and the movements that arise
when **defiance** becomes contagious, [are a method for the people to
resolve these tensions, **ushering in large-scale
change**.]{.mark}]{.underline} The lack of effective forms of protest
only brings society closer to civil violence. [No technique of
suppression **can prevent** the new spirit from breaking through the
degenerating social order. Today's rulers would be wise to heed the 1786
advice of John Jay]{.underline}, one of the founding Fathers, [to
[respond to insurrection]{.mark} with reform: "[by **attacking the
'disease'** that lies behind them rather than suppressing its
'**symptoms**.']{.mark}]{.underline}[" [A tremendous release of energy
is required to shift]{.underline} ]{.mark}[the paradigm of a declining
[society]{.mark}]{.underline}; aside from mass mobilization for war,
[[the **collective will** of the people]{.mark} for revolution [is one
of the few sources proven to contain sufficient **force**.]{.mark} This
collective will is often manifested as crowds in the
streets.]{.underline} Rabindranath Tagore, the great polymath, once
presciently observed that "[crowd psychology is a blind
force]{.underline}. Like steam and other physical forces, it can be
utilized for creating a tremendous amount of power." If the crowd is
steam power, the Internet-enabled social movement is nuclear energy.
[The challenge is how to harness this **explosive potential for positive
ends**]{.underline}. Social mobilization for change can come from above,
in the form of state-organized war, or below as a grassroots uprising.
Notice the similarities between a battle and protest, a war and social
movement. Both involve the propagation of dramatically new behaviours
intended to smash existing institutions. Revolutions that come from the
people, and wars started by governments, involve a similar process of
ideological stimulation and social deprogramming designed to heal
society through abnormal collective action. Roberta Ash, a theorist of
social movement organization, is correct to observe that war is a kind
of movement: "a national war effort can be understood as a movement
phenomenon...in which an elite mobilizes a large portion of the
population, exciting them ideologically and deroutinizing them." The
theorist Lyford P. Edwards concentrates on the crucial role revolution
plays in destroying "those institutions of a given society which
interfere with the attainment of one or more of the four elemental human
wishes." According to Edwards, humans crave new experience, security,
recognition and response (touch and love). [[Protests are the
**expression of the human spirit**]{.mark} desiring these elemental
wishes and [freeing itself from the **fetters of convention**.]{.mark}
Perhaps the rebellious people are acting out of a desire for a new
social experience, a new way of organizing or interacting with each
other.]{.underline} Or maybe, as in the case of Mohamed Bouazizi who
triggered the Arab Spring, they hunger for economic security and
recognition from their government. Underlying every revolution is a wish
that is being rejected, ignored or deferred. A century ago, the German
political philosopher and influential Communist theorist Frederich
Engels knew this to be true: "wherever there is revolutionary
convulsion, there must be some social want in the background which is
prevented by outworn institutions from satisfying itself." [[Those who
suppress protest]{.mark} in defence of pre-existing institutions [are
interfering with a **natural**]{.mark} **(and beautiful)
[process]{.mark}** [that is]{.mark} absolutely [necessary for the
long-term **vitality of society.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Academic Restlessness DA---Debaters hunger for a new, attention-grabbing paradigm to market when the excitement of a new interpretation wears off. Traditional debaters are eager to capitalize on our protest to demote race and sexuality in this space. This academic restlessness must dominate the representations of debate, such that it becomes impossible to understand the common enemy that can unite traditional and critical debaters. The more self-consciously pleased and disturbed you become in your affirmed and enforced interpretations of "predictability, fairness, and education", the more restless we become inside them. Belonging to this community formed through the domination of framework, our oppression affords us a system to overthrow.

**Ross 2k** (Assc. Director of the Center for AfroAmerican and African
Studies @ U Mich, 2000, Marlon-Professor of English; *Pleasuring
Identity, or the Delicious Politics of Belonging*; NEW LITERARY HISTORY,
Vol. 31, No. 4, Is There Life after Identity Politics?; Autumn, 2000;
pp.827-850.) \\\\EG

Another reason we may be restless inside identity theory is because,
according to the institutional expectations of academe, [[we hunger for
a new, **attention-grabbing**]{.mark} [**paradigm** to market]{.mark} at
[the moment]{.mark} that [the sexiness of a new method]{.mark} seems to
[**wear off**. Anti-identity advocates]{.mark} can smell that moment
approaching and [are **eager to capitalize** on it to **demote
race**]{.mark}**, gender, [and sexuality]{.mark}** [and the identity
groups]{.mark} that [these]{.mark} [categories]{.mark} supposedly
[represent. This]{.mark}]{.underline} sort of [[**academic
restlessness** is]{.underline}]{.mark} a bit
[[underhanded]{.underline}]{.mark}, given that we have been studying
solely the intellectual identity of Aristotle for nigh 2400 years, and
yet there is no movement to clamp down on those who take pleasure in the
study of Aristotelian physics, metaphysics, posterior analytics, ethics,
and poetics, even though these have ceased to provide a living paradigm
for modernity. [This]{.underline} kind of [academic restlessness can
also take place within such an identity discipline like **feminism or
queer studies**.]{.underline} As Wiegman suggests, [certain feminists
are anxious to **return to a universal woman** because they have grown
tired of others\' \"identity politics.\"]{.underline} Otherwise
[instructive **queer theorists**]{.underline} like Freeman in her
contribution here or \[End Page 846\] Lauren Berlant 10 [strive to make
family or church automatic signifiers of unqueer conservatism blocking
the progress of queer theory and politics. This has the effect of
**dismissing** a strong tendency among **Black lesbians, gays, and
bisexuals** to identify with church and family as sites of
transformation]{.underline}, actual and potential, [central to their
sexual identity as Blacks and to their **racial identity** as men-loving
men and women-loving women. [Such restlessness]{.mark}]{.underline}
within an identity discipline [[frequently tends]{.mark} also [to
**assume that stigma**]{.mark}, marginality, [and
typing]{.mark}]{.underline}\--mobilized as key terms in Palumbo-Liu\'s
contribution\--[[must dominate the study of the representation
of]{.mark} intersecting [identities, such that it becomes **impossible
to understand**]{.mark}, for instance, the pleasures of identification
that enable **Black sexual minorities** to find in [the]{.mark} Black
church and the Black family,]{.underline} not only in particular cases
but also as institutions, [magnets for progressive \"identity
politics,\" rather than a [**common enemy** that can unite queers across
race, class, and gender.]{.mark}]{.underline} Instead of assuming that
something is astray with anyone who identifies with these
\"reproductive\" institutions, [[we need to]{.mark} investigate and
[theorize the economies of pleasure operating in]{.mark}
such]{.underline} familial and familiar [[identity]{.mark} attractions.
[If we abandon the study of identity **\"inside\" academe**]{.mark} in
the clamor for a new paradigm, [\"out there\" identity politics]{.mark}
and pleasures [will]{.mark} continue and probably [**intensify**. The
more **self-consciously pleased and disturbed** that we become in our
affirmed and **enforced** identities, the **more restless we become**
\"inside\" them.]{.mark}]{.underline} Even intensified
self-consciousness, however, does not seem to get us closer to the dance
of identification as we experience it pleasurably and disturbingly
\"inside\" and \"across\" our bodies\' persons, individually and
collectively considered. [[Our recourse to]{.mark} more **[externalized
structures]{.mark}**\--like the sides of an argument or the solidity of
economic classes\--[promises]{.mark} some [reprieve, but we grow no less
**restless \"outside\" our**]{.mark} personal and **[collective
selves]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as though individuals and their
dis/affectionate affiliations are emptied of their identity, mere
meanings and patterns bereft of that inner motivating vitality. [As
[\"identity politics\"]{.mark} is not dead, [is]{.mark} in fact
[**thriving**, so]{.mark} I\'d suggest [we get on]{.mark} with [making
its theory]{.mark} and practice [thrive in our intellectual
institutions]{.mark}, accompanied by less nervousness and as much
pleasure as possible]{.underline}. Nealon\'s examination of \"affect\"
as queer reception history is a good instance of this. 11 By insisting
on pleasure as a face/t of identification, I realize that I risk
others\' diminishing the political struggle at stake in the disciplining
of identity forms. I would not sacrifice one to the other. [If identity
is always political, the economies of pleasure at work in identification
also **cannot escape** the play for power, in shared or monopolistic
versions]{.underline}. In fact, [it is [the activity of pleasure]{.mark}
on and [across]{.mark} subjects of [identity]{.mark} that [makes
identity]{.mark} such [a forceful vehicle for]{.mark} oppressive
politics, and]{.underline} likewise this pleasure functions in
[[collective]{.underline}]{.mark} \[End Page 847\] [[**assaults against
oppression**.]{.mark} The pleasures of thinking that one belongs to a
superior white race must be reckoned as interfused with the
**obligations, confusions**, fears, and privileges afforded by such a
sweeping, compelling identity]{.underline}. Fortunately for us, the
pleasure in identifying against dominance cannot be delimited by acts of
domination. [[Belonging to a group formed through others\'
**domination** and one\'s own subordination paradoxically affords its
own]{.mark} peculiar [pleasures aimed at **upsetting the norms of
power**]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}** These are the potentially
liberating pleasures of identification that the domineering cannot
rescind, however much they may practice to outlaw or outpace them. Of
identity\'s politics and pleasures there is no end, and as for the
\"identity politics\" besetting us at the present time, we are only now
beginning to learn the rudimentary steps of the dance.

#### Structuralism DA---Pedagogies of debate mirror your interior world. Valuable educational praxis is an inner practice of liberation which is superior to theorizing of physical action via fiat. By altering our perspectives on debate and the world, we are changing the cause so the effect will change automatically. This requires a reversal of values: from a concern on fiatted nuclear wars and existential crises to campaigns of the soul. We privilege that inner shift as the first step toward external action---a genuine revolution which lies abnormal to the status quo. We protest to reveal debate's truth and uncover the eternal love and fearlessness that can transform the world.

[[The external world is a **mirror** of your interior world]{.mark},
says the subjectivist activist]{.underline}. If external reality appears
dark, it is because your inner reality is dark. "The world we see merely
reflects our own internal frame of reference-the dominant ideas, wishes,
and emotions in our minds." [[The real revolution takes place **inside
our minds**]{.mark} because our thoughts influence how the world appears
to us. "[The way to change]{.mark} the nature of your [experience is to
**change**]{.mark} **the nature of [your
thoughts]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} as the American spiritual teacher
Marianne Williamson says. [[True activism is an inner **practice of
liberation**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Subjectivism is the intersection of
spirituality with the primacy of the internal world. Believers in [this
theory of revolution maintain that [active contemplation and
meditation]{.mark} (from an outside perspective this may look like
passivity) [is **superior** to physical action]{.mark} because our minds
determine reality. Strict subjectivist activists argue, therefore, that
[the most effective way to change the world is to **change our
perspective**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Or as one mystical text explains
it, "[[There is no point in **lamenting the world.**]{.mark} There is no
point in trying to change the world.]{.underline} It is incapable of
change because it is merely an effect. But there is indeed a point in
changing your thoughts about the world. [Here [you are changing the
cause. **The effect will change automatically**]{.mark}]{.underline}."
Similarly, the great Sufi spiritual master Rumi suggests that an
enlightened person can stroll through infernal hell and see rose gardens
upon rose gardens. [The implication is that the world is a **projection
of our mood**. Inner reality determines the external reality. Therefore,
if your external reality is apocalyptic, **mediation is the solution**.
[The subjectivist position requires a **reversal of**]{.mark}
[**values**: from a concern with the **wars** of the world to the
**campaigns of the soul**.]{.mark} "The wars of mankind are like
children's fights-all meaningless, pithless, and
contemptible]{.underline}. All their fights are fought with wood swords,
all their purposes are centered in futility," writes Rumi. [[Revolution
**transcends into a state of mind**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Secular
political scientist have also hypothesized subjectivism. This notion
often takes the form of a weak subjectivism, or a voluntarist
subjectivism where changing the inner world is a necessary (but not
sufficient) condition for revolution. Unlike strict subjectivist who
believe that revolution is accomplished by perceiving the world
differently, [voluntarist [subjectivists privilege the inner shift as a
**first step toward external action.**]{.mark}]{.underline} James C.
Davies writes, for instance, that "political stability and instability
are ultimately dependent on a state of mind, a mood, in a society."
[Once the mood shifts, a **revolution is possible.** Subjectivism
highlights the primacy of the individual's picture of reality. [Genuine
revolution involves protest behaviours that are]{.mark} unusual and
[**abnormal** from]{.mark} [the perspective of the status quo. These new
behaviours are]{.mark} socially coded as **[protest]{.mark}** because
they are the public manifestation of a discordant inner reality within
the people.]{.underline} Demonstrations are proof that large numbers of
society have undergone an inner shift in perspective and are perceiving
the world differently. As if spontaneously, the old world is forced to
defend itself against a new conception, a new world view. Ralph Waldo
Emerson explains it this way: ["every revolution was first a thought in
one man's mind."]{.underline} [Social [revolutionary]{.mark} [moments
arise out of a]{.mark} sense of collective calm in the midst of a
[**revealed truth**.]{.mark} The [people lose their fear, and the
impossible **becomes possible**.]{.mark}]{.underline} When activists are
attuned to emotional contagion, [[we]{.mark} are conscious to
[emit]{.mark} a sense of limitless [possibility, **eternal love and
fearlessness**]{.mark}.]{.underline} "As a man thinketh, so does he
perceive. [Therefore, [seek not to change the world, but]{.mark} choose
[to **change your mind about the world**.]{.mark}]{.underline} The
subjectivist activist sees social networks as channels of emotional
contagion. Words, images and memes are the vectors by which infectious
emotions spread through the network[. The primary work is to produce and
transmit emotions that lead the people toward an inner conversion and a
collective epiphany.]{.underline}

#### Fiat Divestment DA---Progress in debate is constrained by status quo policing via fiat. Debaters flock to the plan-text when what was previously believed to be impossible suddenly seems within reach through hypothetical scenario planning. They believe anything is possible when a sense of collective fiatted hope rises among the community. The specific content that the plan employs is less important than the emotion it spreads. Debate is evolving but the status quo is resilient and activism is useless, and uninspiring when repeated through the same mechanism of fiat. This community's future already exists, but if you are blinded by traditional paradigms of activism, you'll never see the movement.

[There is an **eternal force** within humanity that strives **toward
greater freedom, evolution** and self-actualization. I call this force
spirit. At [most times]{.mark} in history, [the human spirit is
**constrained by the status quo**. When]{.mark}]{.underline}, every once
in a while, [[activists stumble across a new way of approaching the
struggle, the status]{.mark} [quo is **upended**]{.mark}, for better or
worse.]{.underline} In my meditations on revolution, I am increasingly
drawn to a tactical-spiritual explanation of what happens in these
tumultuous moments. I have come to understand that [the role of tactics
is to unleash the collective spirit, a process that hastens a political
miracle.]{.underline} [[The people flock to the movement when what was
previously believed to be impossible **suddenly seems within
reach.**]{.underline}]{.mark} Each of these episodes of protest, drawn
from two thousand years of revolution, demonstrates that spirit-the
immaterial force within us-is the deciding factor in an uprising. Put
simply, the people join the movement they believe will win. [[Anything
is possible when a sense of **collective faith**]{.mark} **in victory
[rises among the people]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} In the final
analysis, [[the specific tactics that activists employ are less
important than the **emotion** these tactics
spread.]{.underline}]{.mark} What seems to matter most is that the
tactics erase fear from participants and are novel and surprising from
the perspective of authorities. Generally speaking, the tactics that
fulfill these two requirements are audacious. The moment the people
become disillusioned with a tactic, it fails. [Similarly, as soon as
authorities **understand the pattern** of a protest ritual it is
defeated. [The balance of power is shifting toward the people, but the
status quo is **resilient** and tactics are **useless, and uninspiring,
when repeated**. ]{.mark}]{.underline} [[The future of activism already
exists.]{.mark} However, [if you are **blinded by old paradigms of
activism**, you'll never see the movement]{.mark} that is about to break
out.]{.underline} [The next protest tactic that will release the human
spirit and unleash a **global social movement** is out there right now
waiting to be seen. The only way to discover it is to look within and
**never protest the same way** **twice**.]{.underline}

###  AT -- TVA

#### Contentment DA---They are content to deploy tactics destined to fail while picking up ballots. They insist that debate's underlying paradigm is still valid or that our revolution is unclear and started too late. They continue to advance slight modifications to the script rather than providing wholly new developments. Prefer revolutionary scholarship which moves beyond critique and towards developing a new paradigm that can replace the old. We must return to debate over the fundamental qualities of this space if we are to ever evolve.

[I'm no longer satisfied with the **standard repertoire of activism**. I
distrust the big-name non-profits and well-funded digital activist front
groups who waste the people's collective energy in large-scale,
**feel-good coalition actions**]{.underline}, like the People's Climate
March of 2014. [I question the motives of activists who advocate old
tactics. I'm starting to believe that these groups are choosing
behaviours designed to **garner attention without risk of challenging
the status quo**.]{.underline} Often it seems that [institutionalized
activist [organizations are content to deploy tactics **destined to fail
while grabbing publicity**]{.mark}]{.underline}, building their list of
email addresses and reaping millions of dollars in donations. It should
have been obvious since the failure of the global anti-Iraq War march on
February 15, 2003, that the synchronized global-march tactic
underpinning the People's Climate March may attract fleeting media
attention but doesn't work to sway governments. Similarly, I would be
the last to advocate another Occupy-unless a refreshing innovation were
proposed. [My mission is to persuade activists to stop ignoring failures
and to stop repeating tactics. [There will be those who respond to the
crisis within activism by **insisting the underlying paradigm is still
valid.**]{.mark} Some will argue that Occupy failed because **it wasn't
perfect**, ignoring that perfection isn't possible and that Occupy came
closer than we'd gotten in half a century. [Others will say that
Occupy's one demand was **not clear or that it started too
late**]{.mark} in the year.]{.underline} (To these people I point to the
failed 2003 anti-Iraq War march that had an absolutely clear demand.)
[There will be [many]{.mark} who [will advocate **slight
modifications**]{.mark} to the protest script [rather than **wholly new
approach**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} This is a common reaction to
the break-down of a dominant paradigm. As the philosopher of science
Thomas Kuhn, whose influential 1962 book The structure of Scientific
revolutions popularized the concept of the paradigm shift, writes,
"Though they may begin to lose faith and then to consider alternatives,
they do not renounce the paradigm that has led them into crisis.... Once
it has achieved the status of paradigm, a scientific theory is declared
invalid only if an alternate candidate is available to take its place."
[[The task of the next generation]{.mark} of protestors [is to respond
to the crisis by moving beyond critique and toward developing a **new
paradigm** that can replace the old. This involves]{.mark}, a Kuhn
points out, "[the proliferation of **competing**
**articulations**,]{.mark} the willingness to try anything, [the
expression of explicit discontent]{.mark}, the recourse to philosophy
[and to **debate over fundamentals.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Interpolation DA---Given a lack of understanding our revolutionary scholarship in this community, framework debaters must impute norms onto us. When they cannot deal with what we stand for, they deal with the disembodies parts that connect us to a larger abstract rule in debate, categories readily available to process deviant bodies into TVAs. Their TVAs try to classify us into identity categories of debate, based on their own limited experiences and understandings.

[[Those]{.mark} contributors [I have not met in person]{.mark},
therefore, [must]{.mark} necessarily [possess face/ts of
identity]{.mark}]{.underline}\--metonymic faces\--[more or less seeable,
knowable, imaginable, [readable to me.]{.mark}]{.underline} This is
because, [[given the lack of such \"evidence\"]{.mark} supposedly
offered by the actual person\'s face, in the effort to reckon what they
are saying and why, [I]{.mark} necessarily [must impute]{.mark} some
kind of [identity to who they are and why they say what they\'re
saying.]{.mark}]{.underline} All of these contributors I have met in
print, as we like to say, and the more print that I\'ve read by them,
the more cohesive\--the less inchoate\--is my sense of an identity for
them. 3 [[My identification of them is]{.underline}]{.mark} not merely a
projection, although we cannot disallow a degree of this, but more
aptly, it is a matter of [[a dialectic between what they project to me
and what I take from that projection.]{.mark} All of this is to assert
that [the most basic]{.mark} [act]{.mark} of \"seeing\" or \"knowing\"
or [\"imaging\" or \"reading\" is]{.mark} itself [a]{.mark} kind [of
face-off]{.mark} that we now call \"identity politics,\" but that was no
doubt called by other names before]{.underline}. And this is so not
merely because we live in a moment in which what we call \"identity
politics\" is rife, or is anticipated as waning because too fluent.
[[When we cannot deal with persons face to face, we]{.mark} always [deal
with face/ts, the disembodied parts that connect them to larger
abstract]{.mark}, but no less material and actual, [categories readily
available to us. When we do meet]{.mark} someone [face to face,]{.mark}
[we still deal only with face/ts]{.mark}, with bodied parts [that we can
classify according to what makes sense to us from our own
limited]{.mark} identity-[experiences.]{.mark}]{.underline} Identities
are not like the faces in facets; they are face/ts. When we therefore
talk about the politics of identity\--no matter how much more
sophisticated we try to make it sound\--we are really talking about the
politics of our face/ts.

#### Academic Restlessness DA---Debaters hunger for a new, attention-grabbing TVA to market when the excitement of our revolutionary aff wears off. Traditional debaters are eager to capitalize on our protest to demote race and sexuality in this space through the TVA. This academic restlessness must dominate the representations of debate, through the TVA's co-option, such that it becomes impossible to understand the common enemy that can unite traditional and critical debaters. Your recourse to an externalized TVA promises reprieve, but we grow no less restless outside this room. The more self-consciously pleased and disturbed you become in your affirmed and enforced interpretations of "predictability, fairness, and education", the more restless we become inside them. Belonging to this community formed through the domination of framework, our oppression affords us a system to overthrow.

Another reason we may be restless inside identity theory is because,
according to the institutional expectations of academe, [[we hunger for
a new, **attention-grabbing**]{.mark} [**paradigm** to market]{.mark} at
[the moment]{.mark} that [the sexiness of a new method]{.mark} seems to
[**wear off**. Anti-identity advocates]{.mark} can smell that moment
approaching and [are **eager to capitalize** on it to **demote
race**]{.mark}**, gender, [and sexuality]{.mark}** [and the identity
groups]{.mark} that [these]{.mark} [categories]{.mark} supposedly
[represent. This]{.mark}]{.underline} sort of [[**academic
restlessness** is]{.underline}]{.mark} a bit
[[underhanded]{.underline}]{.mark}, given that we have been studying
solely the intellectual identity of Aristotle for nigh 2400 years, and
yet there is no movement to clamp down on those who take pleasure in the
study of Aristotelian physics, metaphysics, posterior analytics, ethics,
and poetics, even though these have ceased to provide a living paradigm
for modernity. [This]{.underline} kind of [academic restlessness can
also take place within such an identity discipline like **feminism or
queer studies**.]{.underline} As Wiegman suggests, [certain feminists
are anxious to **return to a universal woman** because they have grown
tired of others\' \"identity politics.\"]{.underline} Otherwise
[instructive **queer theorists**]{.underline} like Freeman in her
contribution here or \[End Page 846\] Lauren Berlant 10 [strive to make
family or church automatic signifiers of unqueer conservatism blocking
the progress of queer theory and politics. This has the effect of
**dismissing** a strong tendency among **Black lesbians, gays, and
bisexuals** to identify with church and family as sites of
transformation]{.underline}, actual and potential, [central to their
sexual identity as Blacks and to their **racial identity** as men-loving
men and women-loving women. [Such restlessness]{.mark}]{.underline}
within an identity discipline [[frequently tends]{.mark} also [to
**assume that stigma**]{.mark}, marginality, [and
typing]{.mark}]{.underline}\--mobilized as key terms in Palumbo-Liu\'s
contribution\--[[must dominate the study of the representation
of]{.mark} intersecting [identities, such that it becomes **impossible
to understand**]{.mark}, for instance, the pleasures of identification
that enable **Black sexual minorities** to find in [the]{.mark} Black
church and the Black family,]{.underline} not only in particular cases
but also as institutions, [magnets for progressive \"identity
politics,\" rather than a [**common enemy** that can unite queers across
race, class, and gender.]{.mark}]{.underline} Instead of assuming that
something is astray with anyone who identifies with these
\"reproductive\" institutions, [[we need to]{.mark} investigate and
[theorize the economies of pleasure operating in]{.mark}
such]{.underline} familial and familiar [[identity]{.mark} attractions.
[If we abandon the study of identity **\"inside\" academe**]{.mark} in
the clamor for a new paradigm, [\"out there\" identity politics]{.mark}
and pleasures [will]{.mark} continue and probably [**intensify**. The
more **self-consciously pleased and disturbed** that we become in our
affirmed and **enforced** identities, the **more restless we become**
\"inside\" them.]{.mark}]{.underline} Even intensified
self-consciousness, however, does not seem to get us closer to the dance
of identification as we experience it pleasurably and disturbingly
\"inside\" and \"across\" our bodies\' persons, individually and
collectively considered. [[Our recourse to]{.mark} more **[externalized
structures]{.mark}**\--like the sides of an argument or the solidity of
economic classes\--[promises]{.mark} some [reprieve, but we grow no less
**restless \"outside\" our**]{.mark} personal and **[collective
selves]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as though individuals and their
dis/affectionate affiliations are emptied of their identity, mere
meanings and patterns bereft of that inner motivating vitality. [As
[\"identity politics\"]{.mark} is not dead, [is]{.mark} in fact
[**thriving**, so]{.mark} I\'d suggest [we get on]{.mark} with [making
its theory]{.mark} and practice [thrive in our intellectual
institutions]{.mark}, accompanied by less nervousness and as much
pleasure as possible]{.underline}. Nealon\'s examination of \"affect\"
as queer reception history is a good instance of this. 11 By insisting
on pleasure as a face/t of identification, I realize that I risk
others\' diminishing the political struggle at stake in the disciplining
of identity forms. I would not sacrifice one to the other. [If identity
is always political, the economies of pleasure at work in identification
also **cannot escape** the play for power, in shared or monopolistic
versions]{.underline}. In fact, [it is [the activity of pleasure]{.mark}
on and [across]{.mark} subjects of [identity]{.mark} that [makes
identity]{.mark} such [a forceful vehicle for]{.mark} oppressive
politics, and]{.underline} likewise this pleasure functions in
[[collective]{.underline}]{.mark} \[End Page 847\] [[**assaults against
oppression**.]{.mark} The pleasures of thinking that one belongs to a
superior white race must be reckoned as interfused with the
**obligations, confusions**, fears, and privileges afforded by such a
sweeping, compelling identity]{.underline}. Fortunately for us, the
pleasure in identifying against dominance cannot be delimited by acts of
domination. [[Belonging to a group formed through others\'
**domination** and one\'s own subordination paradoxically affords its
own]{.mark} peculiar [pleasures aimed at **upsetting the norms of
power**]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}** These are the potentially
liberating pleasures of identification that the domineering cannot
rescind, however much they may practice to outlaw or outpace them. Of
identity\'s politics and pleasures there is no end, and as for the
\"identity politics\" besetting us at the present time, we are only now
beginning to learn the rudimentary steps of the dance.

###  AT -- Switch Side

#### Inclusivity DA---Our revolutionary theory is the activist playbook which, based on accurate principles, yields social change. Switch side debate functions by promulgating broken theories of change, thus disconnecting our protest from social change. Their "inclusivity" dooms our actions will fail and our time squandered. Revolution will always be co-opted by such norms to build the illusion that dissent is tolerated while discouraging any tactics that might actually change debate.

[[A theory of revolution]{.mark} grants **foresight** regarding whether

[Activism based on accurate principles **yields social
change**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Without a theory of why revolutions
happen and a hypothesis of the behaviours that will hasten the next
uprising, there is no way to distinguish between a destined event and an
ineffectual happening. Lenin made this clear: ["[without a revolutionary
theory there can be no **revolutionary movement**." A repressive status
quo functions by **promulgating broken theories of change**, thereby
disconnecting]{.mark} the link between [protest and change so that our
actions **will fail and our time will be squandered**. Repressive
democracies encourage forms of protest that are **least revolutionary
and most ineffective**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The ideal
situation for [a false democracy]{.underline} is to [have frequent
ineffective protests [that give **the illusion that dissent is
tolerated** while discouraging any tactics that might actually change
the]{.mark} legal [regime.]{.mark}]{.underline}

###  XT -- Drop Them

#### Battleground DA---Drop their traditional scholarship. This single decisive victory can change the course of debate. We can reverse the behavior of this community by orchestrating singular victories that surprise our opponents and demoralize them with an L. This spectacular and humiliating defeat would be most effective at revolutionizing the norms of this community.

[[A **single decisive victory** can change the **course of

[repression in a **series** of]{.mark} successful [protests, activists

**mobilize** the world. This]{.mark} victory [does not need to be
violent.]{.mark}]{.underline} In fact, [[a **spectacular and humiliating
non-violent defeat** of riot police would be far more
effective.]{.underline}]{.mark} On the value of winning with as few
victories as possible, the great Chinese military strategist Wu Ch'i,
who lived roughly four hundred years before Arminius, gives excellent
advice: "Those that garner five victories will be exhausted; those with
three victories will become hegemons; those with two victories will be
kings; and those with one victory will become emperors[.]{.underline}
For this reason those who have conquered the world through numerous
victories are extremely rare, while those who thereby perished are
many."

###  XT -- Performance Fanaticism

#### Traditional debate divides the community to be either friends or enemies. Performance Fanaticism achieves political mobilization and refuses to not only compromise with abusive strategies of framework, but rather to go beyond mainstream practices of debate and create alternative forms of engagements. 

**Olson '09** (Assc. Professor of Politics and Intl Affairs @ Northern

Masters: Fanaticism, Wendell Phillips, and the Limits of Democratic

\\\\EG

[Fanaticism is often regarded as an **individual temperament**, a
condition caused by desperation and/or psychological instability that
drives a person to engage in political activity that goes well beyond
the mainstream]{.underline}. Suicide bombers and other terrorists are
the archetype of this temperament.1 It is much less recognized that
[[fanaticism is]{.mark} also [a **strategy to achieve power**.
Fanaticism is the political mobilization of the **refusal to
compromise**. It is an approach to politics that divides the world into
**friends** **and** **enemies**]{.mark} in order [to **mobilize people**
in]{.mark} the service of [a cause]{.mark} one is passionately committed
to]{.underline} (Olson 2007). [[It]{.mark} is a form of engagement that
[seeks not to come to terms with an opponent but to **defeat**
it.]{.mark} It is this specifically political notion of **fanaticism**
with which I am concerned.]{.underline}

###  XT -- Protest = Warfare

#### Warfare DA---Wake up and prepare yourself! You are a partisan in the Revolution of debate. The situation has changed as debate constantly evolves. Simultaneously, practices are becoming insidiously adept at defusing community protest and activism without responding to their demands. On this battle ground of our revolution, performative protest is a form of warfare which mobilizes non-violent armies of norms to inaugurate a new legal regime. There is currently a tactical arms race where each performance is met with repression through losing the round. We must develop and evolve such tactical innovations that emerge and grow exponentially so that framework's defenses are overwhelmed before it can launch a counterattack.

[[**Wake up and prepare yourself**! You are a partisan in the
**Revolution**: a war that has been raging since the people first
demanded democracy]{.mark} over 121 generations ago. The earliest
records of our rebellion are 3,646 years old and document when
**protesters toppled** a pharaoh during the Middle Kingdom of Ancient
Egypt.]{.underline} In an ancient papyrus known as The Dialogue of
Ipuwer and the Lord of All, written between 1980 BC and 1630 BC, an
eponymous spectator records one of our first successful revolutions: "O,
yet the rich are in lamentation, the poor are in joy; every town says,
'Let's drive out the strong among us!' For look, [things have been done
which have not been done before...the removal of the king by
wretches]{.underline}. For look, it has come to rebellion." [When our
revolution first started, a cornucopia of **civilizations** reigned,
each with its own colorful set of beliefs, languages, semiotics,
religions and fighting methods.]{.underline} Many societies were
matriarchal. Some were egalitarian. The greatest cities of the ancient
world (Luxor, Athens, Alexandria, Rome...) were minuscule compared with
the smallest of today's megalopolises. If the people found the local
situation intolerable, they could act locally to rectify the problem.
One telling example of how power functioned before the consolidation of
peoples comes to us [from a nomadic tribe in Africa, where the chief's
power was so **precarious** that if he ruled with too heavy a hand, his
people would desert him in the night. [**The situation has changed**.
With the consolidation of power into]{.mark} kingdoms and then
[nation-states and]{.mark} now into the [immaterial financial flows of
**global corporate-capitalism**, humans are becoming more **culturally
alike**]{.mark} each generation. [The oppressor is no longer]{.mark}
local or [**localizable**. The tyrant is increasingly a **flow of
capital**]{.mark} **and [not a human person]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} The
growing cultural sameness of humanity aids the transmission of our
**insurrection**.]{.underline} Although it may seem that power keeps
increasing despite protest, there are signs that a might reversal is
coming. Everyday peo[ple have the necessary ingredients for the coming
transformation of society: the labour, creativity and **spirit of
humanity**. [The **battle ground of our revolution** is a world composed
of seven billion humans]{.mark}]{.underline} connected by air travel, a
network of fibre-optic undersea cables and orbiting satellites. [[Fear
of **total surveillance and invasions**]{.mark} of privacy [is
growing.]{.mark}]{.underline} Still, technologically adept activists can
find ways to communicate freely with one another from every place on
Earth. [Protest is politics by other means]{.underline}, to paraphrase
the Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz's famous definition
of war. [[Protest is]{.mark} a form of [**warfare** to the extent that
activists set out to achieve]{.mark} strategic [political goals using
**unconventional methods**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Social movements are
non-violent armies whose protests have political
consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}. As in war, [activism does not always
obey the law; [revolutionary activism seeks to inaugurate a new]{.mark}
[legal regime.]{.mark}]{.underline} Gandhi was no less a warrior than
Napoleon. Each wrought major geopolitical shifts in his lifetime using
previously unknown techniques of warfare. Gandhi demonstrated that
non-violence can be highly effective when confronting a foreign colonial
state. He showed that satyagrahis, a trained army of non-violent
warriors, confronting a power with dramatic military superiority could
engender the world's sympathy. Despite the successes of Martin Luther
King Jr.'s campaign to break America's segregated South, subsequent
struggle have shown us that 1960s-era non-violence alone is not enough
and that [corporatist [democracies are becoming]{.mark} insidiously
[adept at **defusing public protest** without responding to
demands]{.mark} democratically.]{.underline} [The [people are locked in
a **tactical arms race with power**]{.mark}, and [each advance]{.mark}
in protest [is met with]{.mark} a counter-advance in [repression.
Activists surmount this danger by working to develop **tactical
innovations** that emerge and grow exponentially so that our enemy's
**defences are overwhelmed** before they can mobilize for the
counterattack.]{.mark} Winning the people's war will require more than
just a unified theory of revolution. It will also need an understanding
of the tactics that have defined the history of protest.]{.underline}

###  XT -- Big Schools DA

#### Big Schools DA---Big-name and well-funded schools waste time through subscribing to traditional debate norms. They choose behaviors designed to garner attention without risking challenging the status quo, never reading revolutionary scholarship, but rather only to deploy tactics destined to fail while grabbing as many trophies as possible. Prefer revolutionary scholarship which moves beyond critique and towards developing a new paradigm that can replace the old.

[[I'm **no longer satisfied** with the standard repertoire of activism.
I distrust the **big-name**]{.mark} non-profits [and
**well-funded**]{.mark} digital [activist]{.mark} front [groups who
waste]{.mark} the [people's]{.mark} collective [energy in large-scale,
**feel-good coalition actions**]{.mark}]{.underline}, like the People's
Climate March of 2014. [[I question the motives of activists who
advocate old tactics.]{.mark} I'm starting to believe that [these groups
are choosing behaviours designed to **garner attention without risk of
challenging the status quo**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Often it seems that
[[institutionalized activist organizations are content to deploy tactics
**destined to fail while grabbing publicity**]{.underline}]{.mark},
building their list of email addresses and reaping millions of dollars
in donations. It should have been obvious since the failure of the
global anti-Iraq War march on February 15, 2003, that the synchronized
global-march tactic underpinning the People's Climate March may attract
fleeting media attention but doesn't work to sway governments.
Similarly, I would be the last to advocate another Occupy-unless a
refreshing innovation were proposed. [My mission is to persuade
activists to stop ignoring failures and to stop repeating tactics. There
will be those who respond to the crisis within activism by insisting the
underlying paradigm is still valid. Some will argue that Occupy failed
because it wasn't perfect, ignoring that perfection isn't possible and
that Occupy came closer than we'd gotten in half a century. Others will
say that Occupy's one demand was not clear or that it started too late
in the year.]{.underline} (To these people I point to the failed 2003
anti-Iraq War march that had an absolutely clear demand.) [There will be
many who will advocate slight modifications to the protest script rather
than wholly new approach]{.underline}. This is a common reaction to the
break-down of a dominant paradigm. As the philosopher of science Thomas
Kuhn, whose influential 1962 book The structure of Scientific
revolutions popularized the concept of the paradigm shift, writes,
"Though they may begin to lose faith and then to consider alternatives,
they do not renounce the paradigm that has led them into crisis.... Once
it has achieved the status of paradigm, a scientific theory is declared
invalid only if an alternate candidate is available to take its place."
[[The task of the next generation]{.mark} of protestors [is to respond
to the crisis by moving]{.mark} [**beyond critique** and toward
developing a **new paradigm** that can replace the old. This
involves]{.mark}, a Kuhn points out, "[the proliferation of
**competing** **articulations**,]{.mark} the willingness to try
anything, [the expression of explicit discontent,]{.mark} the recourse
to philosophy [and to **debate over fundamentals.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Specifically, when bodies deemed "disposable" or "ungrievable" assemble in protest, they press up against the limits of social recognizability. This takes a special meaning as a way of demanding for a livable life, to enact the world of the alt, and to refuse this antiblack world. Means the aff solves the alt, which also justifies the perm.

Finally, then, [how do we understand **resistance** as the mobilization
of vulnerability or exposure]{.underline}? Let me just offer the
following as a way to close: [[When the]{.mark} [bodies of those deemed
"**disposable" or "ungrievable**" assemble in public
view]{.mark}]{.underline} (as happens time and again when the
undocumented arrive in the streets in the United States as part of
public demonstrations), [[they are saying, "we have not slipped quietly
into the **shadows of** ]{.mark}**public [life]{.mark}**[:]{.mark} we
have not become the glaring absence that structures your public
life."]{.underline} In a way, [[the collective **assembling**]{.mark} of
bodies [is an exercise of the popular will]{.mark},]{.underline} a
taking up or taking over of a street that seems to belong to another
public, a [[gathering]{.mark} up of the pavement [for the purposes of
action and speech]{.mark} that [press up against the]{.mark} [limits of
**social recognizability**]{.mark}.]{.underline} But the streets and the
square are not the only way that people assemble, and we know that
social networking produces links of solidarity that can be quite
impressive and effective in the virtual domain. Whether bodies appear in
public shorn of technology or hold cell phones up in concert (as many
now do to document police violence in demonstrations), or whether bodies
are interned under forcible conditions of isolation and destitution, the
body remains a resource, not an endless or a magical one. [A group
[acting]{.mark} [together]{.mark} has to be **supported** to act, and
this [takes on **special meaning**]{.mark} when the action takes place
increasingly [as a way of demanding]{.mark} enduring [support and the
conditions of **livable life**.]{.mark}]{.underline} It could sound like
a vicious circle, but it should come as no surprise that [the bodies
gathered in social movements are asserting the **social modality** of
the body. [This can be a]{.mark} minor [way to **enact** the world we
wish to see, or to **refuse** the one]{.mark} [that is doing us
in.]{.mark} Is this not a form of deliberate exposure and persistence,
the embodied demand for a livable life that shows us the simultaneity of
being precarious and acting?]{.underline}

#### Calling for the right to assemble is a negotiation with the biopolitical structures that can change the notions of which lives are and aren't grievable or precarious

So if the question, how am I to lead a good life? is one of the
elementary questions of morality, indeed perhaps its defining question,
then it would seem that [[morality]{.mark} from its inception [is
bound]{.mark} up [with biopolitics]{.mark}]{.underline}. [By
biopolitics, I mean those powers that organize life, even the powers
[that]{.mark} differentially [dispose lives to precarity]{.mark} as part
of a broader management of populations through governmental and
nongovernmental means, [and that establish]{.mark} a set of [measures
for the]{.mark} differential [valuation of life]{.mark} itself. **[In
asking how to lead my life, I am]{.mark} already [negotiating such forms
of power]{.mark}. The most individual question of morality---how do I
live this life that is mine?---is bound up with biopolitical
questions**]{.underline} distilled in forms such these: Whose lives
matter? [Whose lives do not matter as lives, are not recognizable as
living,]{.underline} or count only ambiguously as alive? Such questions
presume that we cannot take for granted that all living humans bear the
status of a subject who is worthy of rights and protections, with
freedom and a sense of political belonging; on the contrary, such a
status must be secured through political means, and where it is denied,
that deprivation must be made manifest. It has been my suggestion that
**[[to understand the differential]{.mark} way that that such a
[status]{.mark} is allocated, [we must ask whose lives are
grievable]{.mark}, and whose are not? [The biopolitical management of
the ungrievable proves crucial to approaching]{.mark} the question, how
do I lead this [life]{.mark}?]{.underline}** And how do I live this life
within the life, the conditions of living, that structure us now? At
stake is the following sort of inquiry: Whose lives are already
considered not lives, or only partially living, or already dead and
gone, prior to any explicit destruction or abandonment? Of course, this
question becomes most acute for someone, anyone, who already understands
him- or herself to be a dispensable sort of being, one who registers at
an affective and corporeal level that his or her life is not worth
safeguarding, protecting, and valuing. This is someone who understands
that she or he will not be grieved if his or her life is lost, and so
one for whom the conditional claim "I would not be grieved" is actively
lived in the present moment. [[If]{.mark} it turns out that [I have no
certainty]{.mark} that I will have food or shelter, or that no social
[network]{.mark} or institution would catch me if I fall, [then
I]{.mark} come to [belong to the ungrievable]{.mark}.]{.underline} This
does not mean that there won't be some who grieve me, or that the
ungrievable do not have ways of grieving one another. It doesn't mean
that I won't be grieved in one corner and not in another, or that the
loss doesn't register at all. But these forms of persistence and
resistance still take place within the shadow-life of the public,
occasionally breaking out and contesting those schemes by which they are
devalued by asserting their collective value. So, yes, [[the ungrievable
gather]{.mark} sometimes [in public insurgencies of grief]{.mark}, which
is why in so many countries it is difficult to distinguish the funeral
from the demonstration.]{.underline} So I overstate the case, but I do
it for a reason. [[The reason that someone will not be grieved]{.mark},
or has already been established as one who is not to be grieved, [is
that there is no]{.mark} present [structure of support that will sustain
that life]{.mark}]{.underline}, which implies that it is devalued, not
worth supporting and protecting as a life by dominant schemes of value[.
The very future of my life depends upon that condition of support, so
[if I am not supported, then my life is]{.mark} established as tenuous,
[precarious]{.mark}, and in that sense not worthy to be protected from
injury or loss, [and]{.mark} so [not grievable]{.mark}]{.underline}. If
only a grievable life can be valued, and valued through time, then [only
a grievable life will be eligible for social and economic support,
housing, health care, employment, rights of political expression, forms
of social recognition, and conditions for political agency]{.underline}.
One must, as it were, be grievable before one is lost, before any
question of being neglected or abandoned, and one must be able to live a
life knowing that the loss of this life that I am would be mourned and
so every measure will be taken to forestall this loss.

###  AT -- Social Death

#### Pessimist claims of social death reify anti-blackness through the prescription of a grammar of abjection. Prefer the 1AC's protest of oppressive regimes that effectively challenge the illegitimate anti-black state as proven by undocumented immigrants' claims to citizenship in LA - our grammar of resistance allows for social life within social death

[For Arendt, political action takes place on the condition that the body
appear]{.underline}. I appear to others, and they appear to me, which
means that some space between us allows each to appear. One might expect
that we appear within a space or that we are supported by a material
organization of space. But that is not her argument. The sphere of
appearance is not simple, since it seems to arise only on the condition
of a certain intersubjective facing off. We are not simply visual
phenomena for each other---our voices must be registered, and so we must
be heard; rather, who we are, bodily, is already a way of being "for"
the other, appearing in ways that we can neither see nor hear; that is,
we are made available, bodily, for another whose perspective we can
neither fully anticipate nor control. In this way, I am, as a body, not
only for myself, not even primarily for myself, but I find myself, if I
find myself at all, constituted and dispossessed by the perspective of
others. So, for political action, I must appear to others in ways I
cannot know, and in this way, my body is established by perspectives
that I cannot inhabit but that, surely, inhabit me. This is an important
point because it is not the case that the body only establishes my own
perspective; it is also what displaces that perspective and makes that
displacement into a necessity. This happens most clearly when we think
about bodies that act together. **[[No one body establishes the space of
appearance]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but this action, **[[this
performative exercise, happens only "between"
bodies]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in a space that constitutes the gap
between my own body and another's. In this way, [my body does not act
alone when it acts politically.]{.underline} Indeed, [the action emerges
from the "between," a spatial figure for a relation that both binds and
differentiates]{.underline}. It is both problematic and interesting
that, for Arendt, the space of appearance is not only an architectural
given: "the space of appearance comes into being," she writes, "wherever
men are together in the manner of speech and action, and therefore
predates and precedes all formal constitution of the public realm and
the various forms of government, that is, the various forms in which the
public realm may be organized."7 In other words, this space of
appearance is not a location that can be separated from the plural
action that brings it about; it is not there outside of the action that
invokes and constitutes it. And yet, if we are to accept this view, we
have to understand how **[the plurality that acts is itself
constituted]{.underline}**. How does a plurality form, and what material
supports are necessary for that formation? Who enters this plurality,
and who does not, and how are such matters decided? [How do we describe
the action and the status of those beings disaggregated from the plural?
What political language do we have in reserve for describing that
exclusion and the forms of resistance that crack open the sphere of
appearance as it is currently delimited]{.underline}? Are those who live
on the outside of the sphere of appearance the deanimated "givens" of
political life? Are they mere life or bare life? [**[Are we to say that
those who are excluded are simply unreal]{.mark}**, disappeared,
**[or]{.mark}** that they have no being at all---shall they be cast off,
theoretically, as the **[socially dead]{.mark}** and the merely
spectral? **[If we do that, we]{.mark}** not only adopt the position of
a particular regime of appearance, but **[ratify that perspective, even
if our wish is to call it into question]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Do such
formulations describe a state of having been made destitute by existing
political arrangements, or is that destitution unwittingly ratified by a
theory that adopts the perspective of those who regulate and police the
sphere of appearance itself? At stake is the question of whether the
destitute are outside of politics and power or are in fact living out a
specific form of political destitution along with specific forms of
political agency and resistance that expose the policing of the
boundaries of the sphere of appearance itself. [**[If we claim that the
destitute are outside of]{.mark}** the sphere of
**[politics]{.mark}**---reduced to depoliticized forms of
being---**[then we implicitly accept]{.mark}** as right **[the dominant
ways of establishing the limits of the political]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
In some ways, this follows from the Arendtian position that adopts the
internal point of view of the [Greek polis]{.underline} on what politics
should be, who should gain entry into the public square, and who should
remain in the private sphere. Such a view [disregards and devalues those
forms of political agency that emerge precisely in those domains deemed
prepolitical or extrapolitical and that break into the sphere of
appearance as from the outside, as its outside, confounding the
distinction between inside and outside]{.underline}. For in
revolutionary or insurrectionary moments, we are no longer sure what
operates as the space of politics, just as we are often unsure about
exactly in what time we are living, since **[[the established regimes of
both space and time are upended]{.mark} in ways [that expose their
violence and their contingent limits]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[We see
this]{.underline}**, as mentioned earlier, **[[when undocumented workers
gather]{.mark} in the city of Los Angeles [to claim their rights of
assembly and of citizenship without being citizens, without having any
legal right to do so]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Their labor is supposed to
remain necessary and shrouded from view, and so [when these laboring
bodies emerge on the street, acting like citizens, they make a mimetic
claim to citizenship that alters not only how they appear]{.underline},
but how the sphere of appearance works. Indeed, [the sphere of
appearance is both mobilized and disabled when an exploited and laboring
class emerges on the street to announce itself and express its
opposition to being the unseen condition of what appears as
political.]{.underline} The impetus for Giorgio Agamben's notion of
"bare life"8 derives from this very conception of the polis in Arendt's
political philosophy and, I would suggest, runs the risk of this very
problem: if we seek to take account of exclusion itself as a political
problem, as part of politics itself, then it will not do to say that
once excluded, those beings lack appearance or "reality" in political
terms, that they have no social or political standing or are cast out
and reduced to mere being (forms of givenness precluded from the sphere
of action). Nothing so metaphysically extravagant has to happen [if we
agree that one reason the sphere of the political cannot be defined by
the classic conception of the polis is that we are then deprived of
having and using a language for those forms of agency and resistance
undertaken by the dispossessed]{.underline}. Those who find themselves
in positions of radical exposure to violence, without basic political
protections by forms of law, are not for that reason outside the
political or deprived of all forms of agency. Of course, [**[we need a
language to describe that status of unacceptable exposure]{.mark}**,
**[but we have to be careful that the language we use does not further
deprive such populations of]{.mark}** all forms of **[agency]{.mark}**
and resistance, all ways of caring for one another **[or establishing
networks of support]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Although Agamben borrows
from Foucault to articulate a conception of the biopolitical, the thesis
of "bare life" remains untouched by that conception. As a result, we
cannot within that vocabulary describe the modes of agency and action
undertaken by the stateless, the occupied, and the disenfranchised,
since [**[even the life stripped of rights]{.mark}** is still within the
sphere of the political and **[is thus not reduced to mere being, but
is]{.mark}**, more often than not, angered, indignant, **[rising up, and
resisting]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [To be outside established and
legitimate political structures is still to be saturated in power
relations, and this saturation is the point of departure for a theory of
the political that includes dominant and subjugated forms, modes of
inclusion and legitimation as well as modes of delegitimation and
effacement.]{.underline}

#### Even under conditions of social death, the moral obligation to reduce oppression still persists. Survival is not the ultimate goal of life, and we must strive to "live a good life in a bad life" through embodied political resistance.

**Butler '18** (Judith Butler, writes comparative literature on gender

If I am not able to establish my value in the world in any more than a
transient way, then my sense of possibility is equally transient.
[**[The moral imperative to lead a good life]{.mark}**, and the
reflective questions it engenders, can both sometimes **[seem very cruel
and unthinking to those who live in conditions of
hopelessness]{.mark}**;]{.underline} and we can perhaps easily
understand the cynicism that sometimes envelops the very practice of
morality: [Why should I act morally, or even ask the question of how
best to live, if my life is already not considered to be a life, if my
life is already treated as a form of death, or if I belong to what
Orlando Patterson has called the realm of "social
death"]{.underline}---a term he used to describe the condition of living
under slavery?6 Because [[contemporary forms of economic abandonment and
dispossession]{.underline}]{.mark} that follow from the
institutionalization of neoliberal rationalities or the differential
production of precarity [[cannot]{.mark} for the most part [be
analogized with slavery]{.mark}]{.underline}, it remains important to
distinguish among modalities of social death. Perhaps we cannot use one
word to describe the conditions under which lives becomes unlivable, yet
[**the term "precarity" can distinguish between modes of "unlivability":
those who, for instance, belong to imprisonment without recourse to due
process; those who characterize living in war zones or under
occupation,** exposed to violence and destruction without recourse to
safety or exit; those who undergo forced emigration and live in liminal
zones, waiting for borders to open, food to arrive, and the prospect of
living with documentation; those who mark the condition of being part of
a dispensable or expendable workforce]{.underline} for whom the prospect
of a stable livelihood seems increasingly remote, and who live in a
daily way within a collapsed temporal horizon, suffering a sense of a
damaged future in the stomach and in the bones, trying to feel but
fearing more what might be felt. [**How can one ask how best to lead a
life when one feels no power to direct life**, when one is uncertain
that one is alive, or when one is struggling to feel the sense that one
is alive, but also fearing that feeling, and the pain of living in this
way? **Under contemporary conditions of forced emigration and
neoliberalism, vast populations now live with no sense of a secure
future,** no sense of continuing political belonging, living a sense of
damaged life as part of the daily experience of
neoliberalism.]{.underline} I do not mean to say that the struggle for
survival precedes the domain of morality or moral obligation as such,
since we know that **[[even under conditions of extreme threat, people
do offer whatever acts of support are possible]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
We know this from some of the extraordinary reports from the
concentration camps. [In the work of Robert Antelme, for instance, it
could be the exchange of a cigarette between those who share no common
language, but find themselves in the same condition of imprisonment and
peril in the concentration camp]{.underline}. Or in the work of Primo
Levi, the response to the other can take the form of simply listening
to, and recording, the details of the story that the other might tell,
letting that story become part of an undeniable archive, the enduring
trace of loss that compels the ongoing obligation to mourn; or in the
work of Charlotte Delbo, [the sudden offering to another of the last
piece of bread that one desperately needs for oneself. And yet, in these
same accounts, there are also those who will not extend the
hand]{.underline}, who will take the bread for oneself, hoard the
cigarette, and sometimes suffer the anguish of depriving another under
conditions of radical destitution. In other words, **[[under]{.mark}
conditions of extreme peril and heightened [precarity, the moral dilemma
does not pass away;]{.mark} [it persists precisely in]{.mark} the
tension between wanting to live and [wanting to live in a certain way
with others]{.mark}]{.underline}**. One is still in small and vital ways
"leading a life" as one recites or hears the story, as one affirms
whatever occasion there might be to acknowledge the life and suffering
of another. [Even the utterance of a name can come as the most
extraordinary form of recognition]{.underline}, especially when one has
become nameless or when one's name has been replaced by a number, or
when one is not addressed at all. At a controversial moment, in speaking
about the Jewish people, Hannah Arendt made clear that it was not enough
for the Jews to struggle for survival, and that [[survival cannot be the
end or goal of life itself]{.underline}.]{.mark}7 Citing Socrates, she
insisted on the crucial distinction between the desire to live and the
desire to live well or, rather, the desire to live the good life.8 For
Arendt, survival was not, and should not be, a goal in itself, since
[life itself was not an intrinsic good. Only the good life makes life
worth living]{.underline}. She resolved that Socratic dilemma quite
easily but perhaps too quickly, or so it seems to me. I am not sure her
answer can work for us, nor am I convinced that it ever did quite work.
For Arendt, the life of the body had for the most part to be separated
from the life of the mind, which is why in The Human Condition she drew
a distinction between the public and private spheres. The private sphere
included the domain of need, the reproduction of material life,
sexuality, life, death, and transience. She clearly understood that the
private sphere supported the public sphere of action and thought, but in
her view, the political is defined by action, including the active sense
of speaking. So [[the verbal deed became the action of]{.mark} the
[deliberative]{.mark} and public space of [politics]{.mark}. Those who
entered into the public sphere did so from the private sphere, so the
public sphere depended fundamentally on the reproduction of the private
and the clear passageway that led from the private to the
public]{.underline}. Those who could not speak Greek, who came from
elsewhere and whose speech was not intelligible, were considered
barbarians, which means that [the public sphere was not conceived as a
space of multilingualism and so failed to imply the practice of
translation as a public obligation]{.underline}. And yet, we can see
that the efficacious verbal act depended on (a) a stable and sequestered
private sphere that reproduced the masculine speaker and actor and (b) a
language designated for verbal action, the defining feature of politics,
that could be heard and understood because it conformed to the demands
of monolingualism. The public sphere, defined by an intelligible and
efficacious set of speech acts, was thus perpetually shadowed by the
problems of unrecognized labor (women and slaves) and multilingualism.
[And the site where both converge was precisely the situation of the
slave, one who could be replaced, whose political status was null, and
whose language was considered no language at all]{.underline}. Of
course, Arendt understood that [the body was important to any conception
of action, and that even those who fight in resistances or in
revolutions had to undertake bodily actions to claim their rights and to
create something new]{.underline}.9 And the body was certainly important
to public speech, understood as a verbal form of action. The body
appears again as a central figure in her important conception of
natality, which is linked with her conception of both aesthetics and
politics. After all, the kind of action understood as "giving birth" is
not quite the same as the action involved in revolution, and yet both
are bound together by the fact that they are different ways of creating
something new, without precedent[. [If there is suffering in acts of
political resistance]{.mark} or, indeed, in giving birth, [it is a
suffering that serves the purpose of bringing something new into the
world]{.mark}.]{.underline} And yet, what do we make of that suffering
that belongs to forms of labor that slowly or quickly destroy the body
of the laborer, or other forms that serve no instrumental purpose at
all? If we define politics restrictively as an active stance, verbal and
physical, that takes place within a clearly demarcated public sphere,
then it seems we are left to call "useless suffering" and unrecognized
labor the prepolitical---experiences, not actions, that exist outside
the political as such. However, [since any conception of the political
has to take into account what operation of power demarcates the
political from the prepolitical,]{.underline} and how the distinction
between public and private accords differential value to different life
processes, we have to refuse the Arendtian definition, even as it gives
us much to value. Or, rather, we have to take the Arendtian distinction
between the life of the body and the life of the mind as a point of
departure for thinking about a different kind of bodily politics. After
all, Arendt does not simply distinguish mind and body in a Cartesian
sense; rather, she affirms only those forms of embodied thought and
action that create something new, that undertake action with
performative efficacy. [[Actions that are performative]{.mark} are
irreducible to technical applications, and [they are differentiated from
passive and transient forms of experience]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus,
[when and where there is suffering or transience, it is there to be
transformed into the life of action and thought]{.underline}, and that
action and thought has to be performative in the illocutionary sense,
modeled on aesthetic judgment, bringing something new into the world.
This means that [[the body concerned solely with the issues of survival,
with the reproduction of material conditions]{.mark} and the
satisfaction of basic needs, [is not yet the "political"
body]{.mark};]{.underline} the private is necessary, to be sure, since
the political body can only emerge into the light of public space to act
and think if it is well fed and well sheltered, supported by numerous
prepolitical actors whose action is not political. [If there is no
political actor who cannot assume that the private domain operates as
support, then [the political defined as the public is essentially
dependent on the private]{.mark}]{.underline}, which means that [the
private is not the opposite of the political,]{.underline} but enters
into its very definition. This well-fed body speaks openly and publicly;
this body who spent the night sheltered and in the private company of
others emerges always later to act in public. That private sphere
becomes the very background of public action, but should it for that
reason be cast as prepolitical? Does it, for instance, matter whether
relations of equality or dignity or nonviolence exist in that shadowy
background where women, children, the elderly, and slaves dwell? If one
sphere of inequality is disavowed in order to justify and promote
another sphere of equality, then surely we need a politics that can name
and expose that very contradiction and the operation of disavowal by
which it is sustained. [If we accept the definition Arendt proposes
between public and private, we run the risk of ratifying that
disavowal.]{.underline} So, what is at stake here in revisiting Arendt's
account of the private and public distinction in the classical Greek
polis? [[The disavowal of dependency becomes the precondition of the
autonomous thinking and acting political subject]{.mark}, which
immediately raises the question of what kind of "autonomous" thought and
action this might be. And if we agree to the private and public
distinction that Arendt presents, we accept that disavowal of dependency
as a precondition of politics rather than taking those mechanisms of
disavowal as the objects of our own critical analysis]{.underline}.
Indeed, [it is the critique of that unacknowledged dependency that
establishes the point of departure for a new body politics, one that
begins with an understanding of human dependency and
interdependency]{.underline}, [one that, in other words, can account for
the relation between precarity and performativity.]{.underline}

###  AT -- Pessimism

#### Bodily vulnerability is an ontological condition integral to experiences within Civil Society. This precarity and the exposure to others can be mobilized to change the conditions in a "common world" characterized by disproportionate precarity

**Butler '18** (Judith Butler, writes comparative literature on gender
theory and is a gender theorist who works at UC Berkeley, Hannah Arendt

Perhaps now I can make clear several points about vulnerability that
seek neither to idealize nor to discount its political importance. The
first is that [[vulnerability cannot be associated exclusively with
injurability]{.underline}]{.mark}. All responsiveness to what happens is
a function and effect of vulnerability---of being open to a history,
registering an impression, or having something impressed upon one's
understanding. Vulnerability may be a function of openness, that is, of
being open to a world that is not fully known or predictable. Part of
what [[a body]{.mark}]{.underline} does (to use the phrase of Deleuze,
derived from his reading of Spinoza) [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} to open
onto the body of another, or a set of others, and for this reason bodies
are not self-enclosed kinds of entities.13 [They are always in some
sense [outside themselves, exploring]{.mark} or navigating [their
environment]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [extended [and]{.mark}
[even]{.mark} sometimes [dispossessed through the
senses]{.mark}]{.underline}.14 If we can become lost in another, or if
our tactile, motile, haptic, visual, olfactory, or auditory capacities
comport us beyond ourselves, that is because the body does not stay in
its own place, and because dispossession of this kind characterizes
bodily sense more generally. It is also why it is important to speak
sometimes about the regulation of the senses as a political
matter---there are certain photographs of the injury or destruction of
bodies in war, for example, that we are often forbidden to see precisely
because there is a fear that this body will feel something about what
those other bodies underwent, or that this body, in its sensory
comportment outside itself, will not remain enclosed, monadic, and
individual. Indeed, we might ask what kind of regulation of the
senses---[those modes of [ecstatic relationality]{.mark}---[might have
to be instituted for individualism to be maintained as an
ontology]{.mark} required for both economics and politics. Although we
often speak as if vulnerability is a contingent and passing
circumstance, there are reasons not to accept that as a general
view]{.underline}. Of course, it is always possible to say, "I was
vulnerable then, but I am not vulnerable anymore," and we say that in
relation to specific situations in which we felt ourselves to be at risk
or injurable. Those can be economic or financial situations when we feel
that we are exploited, having lost work, or find ourselves in conditions
of poverty, in need of public assistance that is itself being cut back
assiduously. Or they can be emotional situations in which we are very
much vulnerable to rejection, but later find that we have lost that
vulnerability. [Even as it makes sense that we speak this way, it makes
equal sense to treat with caution the seductions of ordinary discourse
at this moment]{.underline}. And though we may legitimately feel that we
are vulnerable in some instances and not in others, **[[the condition of
our vulnerability is itself not changeable]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This
does not mean that we are objectively or subjectively equally vulnerable
all the time. But it does mean that **[[it is a]{.mark} more or less
implicit or explicit [feature of our
experience]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} [To say that any of us are
vulnerable beings is to mark our radical dependency not only on
others]{.underline}, but on a sustaining and sustainable world. This has
implications for understanding who we are as emotionally and sexually
passionate beings, as bound up with others from the start, but also as
beings who seek to persist, and whose persistence can be imperiled or
sustained depending on whether social, economic, and political
structures offer sufficient support for a livable life. [[Populations
marked by]{.mark} differential vulnerability and [precarity are
not]{.mark} for that reason [immobilized]{.mark}]{.underline}. When
political struggles emerge to oppose such conditions, [[they are
mobilizing precarity, and even]{.mark} sometimes quite deliberately
[mobilizing the public exposure of the body, even when it means being
exposed to force]{.mark} or detention or possibly death]{.underline}. It
is not that vulnerability is converted into resistance, at which point
strength triumphs over vulnerability. [Strength is not quite the
opposite of vulnerability]{.underline}, and this becomes clear, I would
suggest, when vulnerability is itself mobilized, not as an individual
strategy, but in concert. This is probably not what Hannah Arendt had in
mind when she said that politics depends on acting in concert---I can't
imagine she would have much liked the Slut Walks.15 But perhaps if we
rethink her view so that the body, and its requirements, becomes part of
the action and aim of the political, we can start to approach a notion
of plurality that is thought together with both performativity and
interdependency. Now, I realize that I have introduced new terms without
being able to clarify my meaning sufficiently. "Interdependency" is one.
I'd caution in this way: [We cannot presume that interdependency is some
beautiful state of coexistence; it is not the same as social harmony.
[Inevitably, we rail against those]{.mark} on [whom we are most
dependent]{.mark}]{.underline} (or those who are most dependent on us),
and there is no way to dissociate dependency from aggression once and
for all---this was perhaps the profound insight of Melanie Klein, but
surely also Thomas Hobbes in another idiom. In the early 1980s, [the
black American feminist Bernice Johnson Reagon put the point this way:
"I feel as if I'm gonna keel over any minute and die. That is often what
it feels like if you're really doing coalition work]{.underline}. Most
of the time you feel threatened to the core and if you don't, you're not
really doing no coalescing.... You don't go into coalition because you
just like it. The only reason you would consider trying to team up with
somebody who could possibly kill you, is because that's the only way you
can figure you can stay alive." Toward the end of her remarks, she makes
clear [that [interdependency includes the threat of
death]{.underline}]{.mark}: [[about the idea of a common world,]{.mark}
one we could call "our common world,"]{.underline} she remarks, "You
must be sure you understand that you ain't gonna be able to have an
'our' \[as in our world\] that don't include Bernice Johnson Reagon,
cause I don't plan to go nowhere! That's why we have to have coalitions.
Cause I ain't gonna let you live unless you let me live. Now there's
danger in that, but there's also the possibility that we can both
live---if you can stand it." In a sense[, the people you find in the
street or off the street or in the prison or on the periphery, on the
path that still is no street, or in whatever basement that houses the
coalition that is possible at the moment are not precisely the ones you
chose]{.underline}. I mean, for the most part, when we arrive, we do not
know who else is arriving, which means that we accept a kind of unchosen
dimension to our solidarity with others. Perhaps we could say that [[the
body is always exposed to people and impressions it does not have a say
about]{.mark}, does not get to predict or fully control, [and]{.mark}
that [these conditions of social embodiment are those we have not fully
brokered]{.mark}. I want to suggest that [solidarity emerges from this
rather than]{.mark} from [deliberate agreements]{.mark} we enter
knowingly.]{.underline}

###  AT Fem/QT

#### Queer theory and feminist studies hunger for a new, attention-grabbing paradigm to market when the excitement of a new revolutionary interpretation wears off. Such debaters are eager to capitalize on our protest to demote racial understandings in this space. This academic restlessness must dominate the representations of debate, such that it becomes impossible to understand the common enemy that can queer, feminist, and race debaters. The more self-consciously pleased and disturbed you become in your affirmed and enforced theorizations of queerness and feminism, the more restless we become inside them.

Another reason we may be restless inside identity theory is because,
according to the institutional expectations of academe, [[we hunger for
a new, **attention-grabbing**]{.mark} [**paradigm** to market]{.mark} at
[the moment]{.mark} that [the sexiness of a new method]{.mark} seems to
[**wear off**. Anti-identity advocates]{.mark} can smell that moment
approaching and [are **eager to capitalize** on it to **demote race,
gender, and sexuality** and the identity groups]{.mark} that [these
categories]{.mark} supposedly [represent. This]{.mark}]{.underline} sort
of [[**academic restlessness**]{.mark} is]{.underline} a bit
[underhanded]{.underline}, given that we have been studying solely the
intellectual identity of Aristotle for nigh 2400 years, and yet there is
no movement to clamp down on those who take pleasure in the study of
Aristotelian physics, metaphysics, posterior analytics, ethics, and
poetics, even though these have ceased to provide a living paradigm for
modernity. [This]{.underline} kind of [academic restlessness
[can]{.mark} also [take place within]{.mark} such an identity discipline
like **[feminism or]{.mark} [queer
studies]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} As Wiegman suggests, [certain
[feminists are anxious to **return to a universal woman** because they
have grown tired of others\' \"identity politics.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}
Otherwise [instructive **[queer theorists]{.mark}**]{.underline} like
Freeman in her contribution here or \[End Page 846\] Lauren Berlant 10
[[strive to make family or church]{.mark} automatic [signifiers of
unqueer conservatism]{.mark} blocking the progress of queer theory and
politics. [This has the effect of **dismissing** a strong tendency among
**Black lesbians, gays, and bisexuals** to identify with church and
family as sites of transformation]{.mark}]{.underline}, actual and
potential, [central to their sexual identity as Blacks and to their
**racial identity** as men-loving men and women-loving women. [Such
restlessness]{.mark}]{.underline} within an identity discipline
[[frequently tends]{.mark} also [to **assume that stigma**]{.mark},
marginality, [and typing]{.mark}]{.underline}\--mobilized as key terms
in Palumbo-Liu\'s contribution\--[[must dominate the study of the
representation of]{.mark} intersecting [identities, such that it becomes
**impossible to understand**]{.mark}, for instance, the pleasures of
identification that enable **Black sexual minorities** to find in
[the]{.mark} Black church and the Black family,]{.underline} not only in
particular cases but also as institutions, [magnets for progressive
\"identity politics,\" rather than a [**common enemy** that can unite
queers across race, class, and gender.]{.mark}]{.underline} Instead of
assuming that something is astray with anyone who identifies with these
\"reproductive\" institutions, [[we need to]{.mark} investigate and
[theorize the economies of pleasure operating in]{.mark}
such]{.underline} familial and familiar [[identity]{.mark} attractions.
If we abandon the study of identity **\"inside\" academe** in the clamor
for a new paradigm, \"out there\" identity politics and pleasures will
continue and probably **intensify**. [The more **self-consciously
pleased and disturbed** that we become in our affirmed and **enforced**
identities, the **more restless we become** \"inside\"
them.]{.mark}]{.underline} Even intensified self-consciousness, however,
does not seem to get us closer to the dance of identification as we
experience it pleasurably and disturbingly \"inside\" and \"across\" our
bodies\' persons, individually and collectively considered. [[Our
recourse to]{.mark} more **[externalized structures]{.mark}**\--like the
sides of an argument or the solidity of economic
classes\--[promises]{.mark} some [reprieve, but we grow no less
**restless \"outside\" our**]{.mark} personal and **[collective
selves]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as though individuals and their
dis/affectionate affiliations are emptied of their identity, mere
meanings and patterns bereft of that inner motivating vitality. [As
[\"identity politics\"]{.mark} is not dead, [is]{.mark} in fact
[**thriving**, so]{.mark} I\'d suggest [we get on]{.mark} with [making
its theory]{.mark} and practice [thrive in our intellectual
institutions]{.mark}, accompanied by less nervousness and as much
pleasure as possible]{.underline}. Nealon\'s examination of \"affect\"
as queer reception history is a good instance of this. 11 By insisting
on pleasure as a face/t of identification, I realize that I risk
others\' diminishing the political struggle at stake in the disciplining
of identity forms. I would not sacrifice one to the other. [If identity
is always political, the economies of pleasure at work in identification
also **cannot escape** the play for power, in shared or monopolistic
versions]{.underline}. In fact, [it is [the activity of pleasure]{.mark}
on and [across]{.mark} subjects of [identity]{.mark} that [makes
identity]{.mark} such [a forceful vehicle for]{.mark} oppressive
politics, and]{.underline} likewise this pleasure functions in
[[collective]{.underline}]{.mark} \[End Page 847\] [[**assaults against
oppression**.]{.mark} The pleasures of thinking that one belongs to a
superior white race must be reckoned as interfused with the
**obligations, confusions**, fears, and privileges afforded by such a
sweeping, compelling identity]{.underline}. Fortunately for us, the
pleasure in identifying against dominance cannot be delimited by acts of
domination. [Belonging to a group formed through others\' **domination**
and one\'s own subordination paradoxically affords its own peculiar
pleasures aimed at **upsetting the norms of power**]{.underline}**.**
These are the potentially liberating pleasures of identification that
the domineering cannot rescind, however much they may practice to outlaw
or outpace them. Of identity\'s politics and pleasures there is no end,
and as for the \"identity politics\" besetting us at the present time,
we are only now beginning to learn the rudimentary steps of the dance.

The term "narrative" can be defined in many different ways. A liberal

narrative, as in someone narrating to you. However, for the purposes of
this essay, [a **clearer definition** of the narrative is offered by
Polkinghorne (1988) as an "organizational scheme expressed in **story**

the personal story of an individual or group of individuals that are
involved in the areas discussed by the current resolution. [[The

[for a debate round would be an **oppressive tragic story**, something

#### Narratives provide a unique space to conceptualize and empathize with one's stories and create a convergence between different perspectives. This epistemological device combines with critical understandings to create a holistic insight into the psyche and debate itself.

[The first step in **orienting to the narratives** of everyday life in
this way is to listen to what people say.]{.underline} Not necessarily
to retell it in exactly those terms, but to enquire into how it would be
possible for them to say that. [What kinds of **assumptions** in what
types of possible world could produce those accounts?]{.underline}
(Clegg, 1993, p.31). [This inquiry offers the ability to gain an insight
into other's existence and **epistemological understandings**. [The
ability to conceptualize or empathize with one's **stories** creates a
convergence between two **different perspectives**. This]{.mark}
convergence [is directly]{.mark} [related to]{.mark} the unifying power
of the narrative as well as [providing]{.mark} a [legitimate means for
the **disenfranchised voice to be heard**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Mumby
(1993) illustrates how [[the duality of narrative]{.mark} structures
[create a social understanding as well as]{.mark} set up [an
**epistemological device** of meaning]{.mark} in which social awareness
is created]{.underline}: Narrative is a socially symbolic act in the
double sense that (a) it takes on meaning only in social context and (b)
it plays a role in the construction of that social context as a cite of
meaning in which social actors are implicated. However, there is no
simple isomorphism between narrative (or any other symbolic form) and
the social realm. In different ways, each of the chapters belies the
notion that the narrative functions monolithically to crate a stable,
structured, social order. Indeed, one of the prevailing themes across
the chapters is the extent to which social order is tenuous, precarious,
and open to negotiation in various ways. In this sense, society is
characterized by an ongoing "struggle over meaning" (p. 5). The
implication of these two factors on intercollegiate debate point to how
the narrative not only relies on the social context for meaning, but
aids in the construction of that context. [Debate is a unique forum to
meet Mumby's socially **symbolic act.** Debate offers a unique social
context in that the majority of audience members are intellectually
versed on the social context of a particular narrative (due to debate
research). The public advocacy emphasis of academic debate also allows
for a "**cite of meaning**" and the adversarial positions in a debate
round allow a team to implicate a judge or another team by virtue of
their position]{.underline}. It is in these mock situations that
debaters are implicated as social actors, and thus are moved to action
by virtue of close engagement with another's story. [[In]{.mark} factors
of [debate the concepts of **theory and practice** are]{.mark}
inexorably [intertwined. When these two competing ideologies can be
combined]{.mark} [creates a **holistic insight** into the human psyche.
Insight gained]{.mark} from this holistic understanding [is created by
**stories**]{.mark} (or narratives) [that]{.mark} [**define human
experience**.]{.mark}]{.underline} The ability to construct a compelling
story can have a dramatic impact on the social epistemology, which
creates a co-constructed knowledge framework. Scholars have posited
that: Stories are among the most universal means of representing human
events. In addition to suggesting an interpretation for a social
happening, [[a well-crafted]{.mark} [narrative can **motivate**]{.mark}
the belief and [action of outsiders toward the]{.mark} actors and
[events]{.mark} caught up [in its plot]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} A
key question about stories, as with other situations- defining symbolic
forms like metaphors, theories, and ideologies is whether [[they
**introduce new**]{.mark} **and constructive [insights]{.mark}** [into
social life]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bennett & Edelman, 1985, p. 156).
[[This]{.mark} form of meaning production and the [**persuasive
potential** of identification]{.mark} established by the narrative [can
be a powerful]{.mark} [force upon the **debate community**]{.mark} or
even society.]{.underline} The process of which an individuals interacts
with a narrative and then how a community reacts to the narrative is
better explained by White (1987) who states: Narrative is revealed to be
particularly effective system of discursive meaning production by which
individuals can be taught to live a distinctively "imaginary relation to
the real conditions of existence," that is to say, an unreal but
meaningful relation to the social formations in which they are
indentured to live out their lives and realize their destinies and
social subjects. To conceive of a narrative discourse in this way
permits us to account for its universality as a cultural fact and for
the interest that dominant social groups have not only in controlling
what will pass for the authoritative myth of a given cultural formation
but also in assuring [the belief that social reality itself can be both
lived and realistically comprehended as a story]{.underline} (p. 187)
The entrance of this new form of information processing seems uncertain.
Thus, the final analysis looks to the debate community in particular and
provides some investigation as to how the persuasiveness of the
narrative could interact with the conventions and norms of the debate
community.

#### Narratives are an essential corrective to a community saturated with blood on the flow. Our model reestablishes empathy in the debate community to produce debates that more breed more educational value.

Having justified that the personal narrative or story can empower the
disenfranchised individual, the next claim that must be justified is
that [the introduction of narratives will aid the entire **debate
community.** The structure of the narrative is **vastly different** than
the structure of more traditional affirmative cases**,**]{.underline}
disadvantages, and counterplans. [This difference creates a problem of
how a narrative should be **evaluated versus a disadvantage** resulting
in worldwide destruction. The narrative structure does not refute this,
nor does the disadvantage outweigh the narrative**.**]{.underline} The
intersection of the disadvantage and the narrative only happens at the
impact level---the narrative is an example of how one person feels in
the vast number of individuals subjected to torture and death by case
harms or disadvantage impacts. The relationship of these structures
guides them to tangentially clash and this does not justify their
exclusion from debate. [[The narrative]{.mark} structure [is a
**powerful persuasive device**, and should be introduced because
it]{.mark}: 1) [privileges]{.mark} the **[emotional appeal]{.mark}** of
the story over the **logical structure** of links, brinks, and impacts,
2) [provides a **snapshot of time** in which a person can identify
with]{.mark} true [suffering]{.mark} as opposed to the longitudinal
aspects of death tallies, [and]{.mark} 3) [opens a **rhetoric of
possibility** in which competitors]{.mark} and judges alike can [affirm
or negate a resolution]{.mark} based off of the ability to **foresee a
future** effected by the narrative. [The debate community has privileged
traditional]{.mark} logical [appeals over **nontraditional
forms**]{.mark} **of argument**. These logical appeals create easy
comparisons for critics since the arguments can be broken down into
simple equations.]{.underline} To weigh a disadvantage of ecological
collapse versus a plan that saves fifty lives is basic math---survival
of the planet always outweighs fifty lives. [These logical appeals are
naturally preferred over emotional appeals because there is no
**systematic** **way** in which to quantify the emotions evoked by a
message. However, narrative debate could create a different form of
**impact analysis at the pathos level**: the emotional appeal of the
narrative could be weighed against the **emotional appeal** of a
disadvantage. This new type of impact analysis provides **clear
ground**, because the traditional disadvantage can have emotional
appeal]{.underline} (deaths of children, environmental
destruction---these all include basic pathos appeals) [and the narrative
can be weighed against this. The other advantage to this form of impact
analysis is that it becomes a forum in the debate community, judges and
competitors alike could begin to **create rubrics and hierarchies** that
would help explain the more powerful versus less powerful pathos
appeals. The realm of the pathos appeal has been understudied for years,
and with its acceptance as a criterion in debate, the community could
lend a helping hand to facilitate a mapping out the **persuasiveness of
pathos appeals**.]{.underline} The second advantage that the narrative
provides in academic debate is that the narrative is centered on a
snapshot in time: [[the narrative is a **glimpse into someone else's
life**]{.mark} for just a moment. [In debate rounds, competitors often
prophesize the most **severe impacts possible**]{.mark} in an attempt
[to get enough "**blood on the flow."** In every debate round, billions
of human beings are killed by some **proclaimed catastrophic
event**]{.mark} that a singular policy measure evoked. By tallying
deaths into the billions, debaters and judges never really have a chance
to **empathize** with one case of human pain]{.underline} and suffering.
Narratives produce an insight into the human condition and illuminate
the struggle our species endures. Compared to traditional policy
arguments that concentrate on future action to remedy current problems,
the narrative forces competitors to empathize with a particular problem
that a human is experiencing now. [[This empathy is lost in contemporary
debate, with debaters claiming future destruction for the planet in
almost **every debate round**.]{.mark} With more narrative debaters, we
may see a resurgence of **probabilistic arguments** against
disadvantages]{.underline}, since the unlikely scenario of nuclear war
might be outweighed by the definite impact to the protagonist of the
narrative (as well as the good possibility that other's have similar
narratives). [[The narrative helps to "**keep it real,**" and centers
the debate]{.mark} round [back to the individuals that the impacts are
directly affecting, creating a **strong link** between debater and the
change that they are advocating]{.mark} in the status
quo**.**]{.underline} The final reason why narratives would help the
debate community is that they do open up a rhetoric of possibility. The
Gulf war may or may not have started (without the narrative), but after
the young Kuwaiti girl spoke, there was a call for war, and war seemed
inevitable, a conclusion that traditional forms of argument would never
have established. This discourse is a prime example of the power of the
narrative, which opened a possibility that before was not an option. The
persuasive force of the narrative affects receiver and the individual
immediately begins to ponder what sort of situation would bring about
such a travesty. This thought process create new possibilities that
individuals can begin conceived even though it was unconsidered before:
The need to evoke possibilities of the human condition is central to the
rhetorical enterprise, transcending any one school or strategy. However,
narrative is perhaps the foremost means by which such possibilities are
disclosed. Through storytelling, rhetors can confront a the states of
awareness and intellectual beliefs of audiences; through it they can
show them previously unsuspected ways of being and acting in the world
(Kirkwood, 1992, p. 32[). These new ways of acting and being are
**reflections** of a different rhetorical style, new faculties that
should be available to the young debater. [The rhetoric of
possibility]{.mark} that is created by having competitors and judges
alike engage the narrative [calls for **new creative actio**ns that
would have normally been dismissed]{.mark} in the contemporary debate
society**.**]{.underline} The rhetoric of possibility is different from
the rhetoric of actuality---the traditional debater creates claims from
a realist framework---the political disadvantage based around the
workings of government, the financial disadvantage from the workings of
the stock market, or the counterplan that tries to implement a plan
through the same traditional policy means. The narrative debater,
working from a rhetoric of possibility works from a different ideology
or school of thought, though the narrative debater would recognize these
same realist conceptions, the narrative debater also tries to guide the
audience to see additional perspectives and to create more solutions
than the realist platform---the narrative debater as asks the audience
to try to work outside and around the realist framework as well. By
helping people examine possibilities, which they previously did not
imagine or think they could achieve, [rhetors can free them to pursue
more satisfying responses to both personal and public needs. Hence a
rhetoric of possibility can illuminate **diverse kinds of
communication**]{.underline} (Kirkwood, 1992, p.44). As of the writing
of this paper, the signing of a debate ballot has gained perlocutionary
force---the action of voting has some concrete impact in the community
(debate and otherwise). Debaters have began to claim that the ballot can
either operate in the traditional debate sense (working from any of a
multitude of debate "paradigms:" stock issues, cost-benefit analysis,
hypothesis-testing, etc.), or the ballot becomes an endorsement of an
ideology, with the action of signing becoming a statement to a larger
community. The narrative can operate at either level: it can be weighed
in a debate round on the probability and pathos appeal of the narration,
or it can be endorsed by a judge for its ideological power. However, the
narrative can be impacted at even higher levels. A performance that
touches debaters and critics alike should be endorsed for the mere fact
that more individuals should hear it. The intellectual landscape would
support any effort or trust to exchange and create ideas. The narrative
could be a stronghold that keeps the death that debaters often claim as
inevitable closer to home.

#### Our model is more educational---Narratives create rhetorical possibility which allows new possibilities and discourses to emerge. Instead of desensitizing debaters, narratives empower debaters to be heard. Narrative debate would allow teams to gain extra-persuasive faculties in personal life and more holistic knowledge of other people. Though it seems that the current debate community does little to directly affect change in the real world, the personification of suffering evinces direct action by debaters and turns us into real world advocates.

[[**Beyond the ballot**, a rhetoric of possibility can influence
the]{.mark} inner [**ethics** of the individual. By **personalizing**
travesties]{.mark} of humans, [the debate]{.mark} [community sees the
**grim reality** of]{.mark} certain areas of [the world---and this
opens]{.mark} whole [**new possibilities**. This]{.mark} personalization
[has an opposite]{.mark} [effect than]{.mark} the [**desensitizing**
debaters]{.mark} to the destruction of the planet.]{.underline} The
implication for the urban debater attempting to gain voice through the
story of another happens at two levels: 1) at the level of personal
empowerment by seeing life through the eyes of another, and 2) the
possibilities enfranchised in telling a personal story to others can
affect change from a community. [[The narrative debater can find
**similarities** between the oppressed voice]{.mark} of the protagonist
of a personal story, [and from that identification, the debater
can]{.mark} allow **themselves to [be heard]{.mark}**[. This]{.mark}
vicarious experience allows the disenfranchised voice of the minority
urban debater to have **atonement**, and the endorsement of this type of
advocacy [can **empower** the urban debater into telling their own
personal stories]{.mark} in public forums. [This]{.mark} affirmation
[would allow debaters to gain **extra persuasive faculties** in personal
life]{.mark} experiences [and]{.mark} grant them [more **holistic
knowledge** of other people]{.mark}]{.underline}. In its basic form,
debate tells the minority urban voice that they can voice through a long
list of plans, disadvantages, and kritiks, but [the narrative would
allow for the minority to see how other **oppressed peo**ple describe
their story, with whole new avenues of possibility.]{.underline} [[The
possibility **spreads throughout a community**]{.underline}]{.mark}, the
second implication of narrative debate, [[creates **new
discourses**]{.mark} about]{.underline} the [real
individuals]{.underline} that so much debate evidence points to.
[Instead of being another possible death from a **horrible situation**,
[the impacts]{.mark} of a position [are **humanized**, and]{.mark} by
doing so, [the individual is more likely]{.mark} to try to [**directly
help** the oppressed]{.mark} voice. [Though it seems that the current
debate community does **little to directly affect change**]{.mark} in
the real world, [the personification of]{.mark} pain and [suffering
might **evince direct** action by debaters.]{.mark} There have been
instances in the past where [debaters that have felt]{.mark} so
[strongly about a kritik have **lobbied** for political action]{.mark}
at a tournament. [The]{.mark} [narrative offers another chance
to]{.mark} involve a debater enough to [become a **real world

#### Debate should not overlook the persuasive potential of narratives and spectacles of violence. Spectacles offer minority debaters opportunities to empathize with other minority voices around the world and breed a rhetoric of transformative possibility. These narratives have the force to evince change and cause revolution in the debate community.

Thomas J. Mickey (1997) explains a very powerful example of the use of
Narrative in contemporary society: The events are as follows: [[On
October 10, 1990]{.mark} Nayriah al-Sabah, [a]{.mark} [15-year-old
Kuwaiti girl, **testified**]{.mark} **before Congress** [about the
**atrocities** that]{.mark} the [Iraqis were committing against Kuwaiti
citizens.]{.mark} She specifically mentioned that Iraqis were **taking
Kuwaiti babies** from incubators in area hospitals. Soon [afterwards,
her \[**narrative**\] became the language of Washington's **call to
arms.**]{.mark} President [Bush mentioned]{.mark} what became known as
[the "incubator atrocities" **six times** in one month]{.mark} and eight
times in 44 days. In the Senate six other senators mentioned the
**incubator atrocities** in the **debate** over whether to go to
war.]{.underline} The resolution passed by five votes (p.278). [[The
narrative]{.underline}]{.mark} testimony of the young Kuwaiti girl for
"Citizens for Free Kuwait" [[was a **strong rhetorical
device**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and many senators before the Gulf War
were persuaded by a child telling a story about the senseless
infanticide occurring in the invaded nation of Kuwait. Mickey's (1997)
analysis continues by noting that the child was in fact the daughter of
the Kuwaiti Ambassador to the United States, was not even in Kuwait at
the time, and was "coached" by the pubic relations firm Hill and
Knowlton (at the nice price of \$10.5 million) on how to tell a story
the right way. Though the aforementioned scenario is a tragic example of
how the narrative can be abused, this essay will try to shed some light
on the more empowering uses of the narrative. Before a senate would ever
go to war, deliberations would be heard from [**[traditional policy
arguments]{.mark}**: Economics issues, oil issues, political policy
ramifications of **war**, and risk of human life. [The]{.mark} Kuwaiti
[girl's narrative **superceded** all]{.mark} these [items of
deliberation and **committed a country to war**.]{.mark}]{.underline}
The traditional cost-benefit criterion that guides both contemporary
governmental policy making and academic debate would not had the ability
to commit a country to war without further discussion. [Academic [debate
uses traditional policy arguments; therefore,]{.mark} academic [debate
**cannot afford to deny**]{.mark} [access to such a powerful persuasive
device.]{.mark} Our **implications** are that academic debate **should
incorporate** the narrative [because it utilizes]{.mark} two
nontraditional persuasive faculties: 1) [**pathos** appeals and]{.mark}
2) [a **rhetoric of possibility** that emphasizes a personal
identification]{.mark}.]{.underline} In order to justify this claim we
must look to some historical formulations of the narrative. From there
the argument will progress as follows: 1) defining what the narrative
is, which includes structural definitions and evaluative criteria, 2)
examining how the narrative can liberate the person, which investigates
empowerment and voice, and 3) implicate how [pathos appeals and
identifying with the possibility will **better the debate
community.**]{.underline}

#### By expressing marginalized perspectives through a particular historical context, other disjointed individuals find solidarity. These stories inject a new narrative into society which provides insight into how our community operates. Using such models, we plan strategies to revolutionize debate and provide spaces for the oppressed to transform themselves. Specifically in debate, this is crucial to account for the marginalized debaters.

The narrative as a discursive act is probably one of the most "human"
actions that a person can engage in. [[Individuals **organize their
lives** in personal stories]{.mark},]{.underline} even to the extent
that most theorists claim that the guiding force of personal development
and psychological maintenance are intrapersonal self-narratives. [To
examine the force of the narrative to the personal, one must look at the
**narrative in relation to identity**]{.underline}: [[Human identities
are]{.mark}]{.underline} considered to be **[[evolving
constructions]{.underline}]{.mark}**; they emerge out of continual
social interactions in the course of life. [Self-[narratives are]{.mark}
developed [stories]{.mark} that must be [told in **specific historical
terms**]{.mark}, using a particular language, reference to a
**particular stock** of working historical conventions [and a particular
**pattern** of]{.mark} dominant beliefs and [values]{.mark}. The most
fundamental narrative forms are **universal**, but the way these forms
are **styled**]{.underline} and filled with content will [depend
upon]{.underline} particular [historical conventions]{.underline} of
time and place (Scheibe, 1986, p. 131). [Personal
[narratives]{.mark}]{.underline} might differ, and special recurring
narratives [may [**dictate further action** of the
individual]{.mark}]{.underline} (such as in a self-fulfilling prophecy).
However, there are fundamental aspects of the narrative that run across
all human beings, and [it is in [the ability to contrast a personal
narrative with the narratives of others]{.mark} that [creates a **unity
of the self with the other.**]{.mark} If a human cannot find universal
aspects that run across all narratives (including their own), than that
human feels disjointed by society]{.underline}: The self is a kind of
aesthetic construct, recollected in and with the life of experience in
narrative fashion. One\'s personal story or personal identity is a
recollected self in which the more complete the story that is formed,
the more integrated the self will be...A self without a story contracts
into the thinness of the personal pronoun (Polkinghorne, 1988, p. 106).
To feel a loss of self through the inability to compare the private
narrative with societal narratives is a personal travesty, but in a
multicultural world where individuals come from such diverse and varied
settings, [[the inability to compare the self with the other]{.mark}
[leaves the]{.mark} unique self with a [**desire** to let his/her voice
be known.]{.mark} It is at this intersection that the narrative takes on
the power to **emancipate the silenced individual**. [The emancipatory
function of the personal narrative lays]{.mark}]{.underline} not so much
in the individuals ability to incorporate societal narratives into
his/her life, but more so [[in making their]{.mark} personal [narrative
**known to the greater society**. By expressing the voice of the]{.mark}
unique [individual, other disjointed individuals can attempt to
**find**]{.mark} similarities and hopefully,
**[solidarity]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The self as constructed narrative
brings with it a dynamism, a fluidity toward social relations[: \[We\]
achieve our personal identities and self-concept through the use of the
narrative configuration, and make our existence into a whole by
**understanding it as an expression** of a single unfolding and
developing story.]{.underline} We are in the middle of our stories and
cannot be sure how they will end; we are constantly having to revise the
plot as new events are added to our lives (Polkinghorne, 1988, p.150).
Since personal identity is at stake in narrative dialogue, the
interlocutors may choose to interject their unique narrative
experiences---at best, a marginalized voice may gain discursive
legitimacy, and at worst an interlocutor may be eschewed by others. [For
the exceptionally **marginalized voice**, the discursive space opened by
the narrative is a **wise move**.]{.underline} Delgado (1992) posits
that [[the narrative gives]{.mark} [unique **voice to the oppressed**:
No matter how limited one\'s resources]{.mark} or range of options, no
matter how unequal one\'s bargaining position, at least [one\'s thoughts
are **free**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Small wonder that the recent
legal-storytelling movement has had such appeal to people of color,
women, gays and lesbians. [[Stories]{.mark} [inject a **new narrative
into**]{.mark} **our [society]{.mark}**[. They demand attention]{.mark};
if aptly told, they win acceptance [or]{.mark}, at a minimum,
[respect.]{.mark}]{.underline} This is why women demand to tell their
account of forced sex, why cancer victims insist that their smoking was
a redressable harm despite the tobacco companies\' pathetic warnings,
and why patient advocates demand a fundamental restructuring of the
doctor-patient relationship (p. 822). [Since the narrative gives voice
to the disenfranchised, peripheral, and marginal, it would be logical
that these identities would **evince action** to accommodate for their
rhetoric.]{.underline} Polkinghorne (1988) gives the final implication
for the narrative: On this basis, humans make decisions about what they
want and what they need to do to satisfy these wants. [[We **retrieve
stories** about our]{.mark} own and the [community\'s]{.mark} [past, and
these provide **models** of how actions and **consequences are linked**.
Using these]{.mark} retrieved [models, we plan our strategies
and]{.mark} actions and [**interpret the intentions** of]{.mark} other
[actors.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Narrative is the discourse structure in
which human action receives its form and through which it is
meaningful]{.underline} (Polkinghorne, 1988, p.135). **[In academic
debate]{.underline}**, with its urban outreach programs, [[policy debate
has never seen such a]{.mark} [diversity of personality. Within
resolutions]{.mark} there is enough freedom to accommodate a marginal
voice---and in [finding similarities between]{.mark} [the urban debater
and the oppressed narrative of a resolutional actor, the debater **finds
him/herself transformed**. The marginalized voice is given an
**ear**]{.mark} **the form of the narrative**, and according to the
aforementioned quotation, [human action in society **gains meaning**
through narratives.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Under our performative paradigm, debaters engage in a shared process of constructing and evaluating their understandings of the world. The power of the narrative lies in the emancipation and societal awareness that occur through our model. Above this, the debate community will benefit through creating more mindful debaters.

Thomas A. Hollihan, Kevin T. Baaske, and Patricia Riley (1987) assert
that [[under a **narrative paradigm**, "debaters]{.mark} and their
judges [would be engaging in a **shared**]{.mark} [**process** of
constructing]{.mark}, communicating, [and evaluating their]{.mark}
respective **[understandings of the world]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (p.
187). Though the narrative paradigm asserted in the late 1980s dealt
primarily with the judge's predispositions in a round, [[the power of
narrative discourse in]{.mark} both [**emancipation and societal
awareness** occur]{.mark} [whenever a narrative is
introduced]{.mark}]{.underline}. This essay has advocated [the narrative
as a way for the typically **excluded** low-socioeconomic urban voice to
gain **legitimacy in a public forum**.]{.underline} By identifying at an
intellectual level with a marginalized voice in a "topic country," [[the
urban debater can find]{.mark} both **[personal voice and
emancipation.]{.mark}** Above this, [the debate circuit]{.mark} in
general [should **benefit** from the narrative]{.mark}, mainly [because
it brings]{.mark} the creation of [**personal identity** to the advocacy
of the debater, creating more **enlightened and mindful** individuals
across the board]{.mark}.]{.underline} If rhetoric is as Aristotle
states as being the "faculty to see all available means of persuasion"
(Kennedy, 1991, p.35), then as a community, we should encourage the use
of narrative debate.

###  XT -- Definition

Since there are so many arenas and disciplines that examine the
persuasive effects of the narrative, [there are also **multiple
definitions** of what a narrative is]{.underline}---each enmeshed with
the ideological propositions of the discipline that defined it:
[[In]{.mark} more **[academic contexts]{.mark}**, there has been
recognition that [narrative is **central** to the representation of
**identity**, in personal memory and self- representation or in
**collective identity** of groups such as **regions, nations, race, and
gender.**]{.mark}]{.underline} [There has been widespread interest in
narrative in **history**, in the operations legal systems, in
psychoanalysis, in economics, and in philosophy]{.underline}. Narrative
is as inescapable as language in general, or as is cause and effect, as
a mode of thinking and being (Currie, 1998, p. 2). Referring back to
Quintillian's delineations, the Narratological discipline focuses on the
form of the narrative, whereas legal theorists and communication
scholars evaluate the narrative in the realm of its function.

###  XT -- Spill-Over DA

#### Spill-Over DA---The question is not whether stories should be told, but WHOSE story will be given room to exist in debate. The dominate power structures permeates the narrative structure that we all use to interpret reality. Injecting counter hegemonic narratives into debate fractures the dominate epistemology, creating a new framework for confront suffering. This spills over to real world action.

[[With each historical moment,]{.mark} however, [the rationale

[How, then, do we think about a livable life without positing a single
or uniform ideal for that life?]{.underline} As I indicated in earlier
chapters, it is not a matter, in my view, of finding out what the human
really is, or should be, since it has surely been made plain that humans
are animals, too, and that their very bodily existence depends upon
systems of support that are both human and nonhuman. So, to a certain
extent, I follow my colleague Donna Haraway in asking us to think about
the [complex relationalities that constitute bodily life,]{.underline}
and in suggesting that we do not need any more ideal forms of the human;
rather, [we need to understand and attend to the complex set of
relations without which we do not exist at all.]{.underline} Of course,
[there are conditions under which the kind of [dependency]{.mark} and
relationality to which I am referring [seems to be unbearable. If a
laborer]{.mark} depends on an employer by whom he or she [is exploited,
**then that laborer's dependency \[is\]**]{.mark} **appears to be
[equivalent to]{.mark} his or her [\[their\] capacity to be
exploited]{.mark}. One might resolve that [one has to do away with all
dependency since]{.mark} the social form that [dependency
assumes]{.mark} is [exploitation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And yet it
would be an error to identify the contingent form that [[dependency
takes under conditions of exploitative labor relations]{.mark} with the
final or necessary meaning of dependency. Even if dependency always
takes one social form or another, it remains something that can and does
transfer among those forms, and so proves to be irreducible to any one
of them]{.underline}. Indeed, my stronger point is simply this: [no
human creature survives or persists without depending on a sustaining
environment, social forms of relationality, and [economic forms]{.mark}
that [presume and structure]{.mark}
inter[dependency]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is true that dependency
implies vulnerability, and sometimes that [[vulnerability is
precise]{.mark}ly [to forms of power that threaten]{.mark} or diminish
[our existence]{.mark}]{.underline}. And yet, this does not mean that we
can legislate against dependency or the condition of vulnerability to
social forms. Indeed, [we could not begin to understand why it is so
difficult to live a good life in a bad life if we were invulnerable to
those forms of power that exploit or manipulate our desire to
live]{.underline}. We desire to live, even to live well, within social
organizations of life, biopolitical regimes, that sometimes establish
our very lives as disposable or negligible or, worse, seek to negate our
lives. [If we cannot persist without social forms of life, and if the
only available ones are those that work against the prospect of our
living, we are in a difficult bind, if not an impossible
one]{.underline}. Put in yet other words, [[we are]{.mark}, as bodies,
[vulnerable to]{.mark} others and to [institutions]{.mark}, and this
vulnerability constitutes one aspect of the social modality through
which bodies persist]{.underline}. [[The issue of my or your
vulnerability implicates us in a]{.mark} broader political [problem
of]{.mark} equality and [inequality]{.mark}, since vulnerability can be
projected and denied (psychological categories), but also exploited and
manipulated (social and economic categories) in the course of producing
and naturalizing forms of social inequality. This is what is meant by
the unequal distribution of vulnerability.]{.underline} My normative
aim, however, is not simply to call for an equal distribution of
vulnerability, since much depends on whether the social form of
vulnerability that is being distributed is itself a livable one. In
other words, one does not want everyone to have an equally unlivable
life[. As much as [equality]{.mark} is a necessary goal, it [remains
insufficient if we do not]{.mark} [know how]{.mark} best [to
evaluate]{.mark} whether or not [the social form of
vulnerability]{.mark} to be distributed is just.]{.underline} On the one
hand, [I am arguing that the disavowal of dependency and, in particular,
the social form of vulnerability to which it gives rise, works to
establish a distinction between those who are dependent and those who
are not]{.underline}. And [this distinction works in the service of
inequality]{.underline}, shoring up forms of paternalism, or casting
those in need in essentialist terms. On the other hand, I am suggesting
**[that [only through]{.mark} a concept of [interdependency that
affirms]{.mark} the bodily dependency, conditions of precarity, and
potentials for [performativity can we]{.mark} think a social and
political world that seeks to [overcome precarity]{.mark} in the name of
livable lives.]{.underline}** In my view, [vulnerability constitutes one
aspect of the political modality of the body]{.underline}, where the
body is surely human, but understood as a human animal.
[[Vulnerability]{.mark} to one another, that is to say, even when
conceived as reciprocal, [marks]{.mark} a precontractual dimension of
our [social relations]{.mark}.]{.underline} This means as well that at
some level it defies that instrumental logic that claims that I will
only protect your vulnerability if you protect mine (wherein politics
becomes a matter of brokering a deal or making a calculation on
chances). In fact, [vulnerability constitutes one of the conditions of
sociality [and political life]{.mark} that cannot be contractually
stipulated, and whose denial and manipulability constitute an effort to
destroy or manage an interdependent social condition of
politics.]{.underline} As Jay Bernstein has made clear, [vulnerability
cannot be associated exclusively with injurability]{.underline}. All
responsiveness to what happens is a function and effect of
vulnerability, whether it is an openness to registering a history that
has not yet been told, or a receptivity to what another body undergoes
or has undergone, even when that body is gone. As I have suggested,
bodies are always in some sense outside themselves, exploring or
navigating their environment, extended and even sometimes dispossessed
through the senses. If we can become lost in another, or if our tactile,
motile, haptic, visual, olfactory, or auditory capacities comport us
beyond ourselves, that is because the body does not stay in its own
place, and because dispossession of this kind characterizes bodily sense
more generally. When being dispossessed in sociality is regarded as a
constitutive function of what it means to live and persist, what
difference does that make to the idea of politics itself?

What forms of "institutionally regulated cooperation" are at issue in
this analogy? They come in two basic flavors, active and passive
cooperation.75 Active cooperation involves institutions in which
movement participants are actively participating. The most obvious
example is labor and consumer participation in the economy. The
Montgomery bus boycott of 1955-56 is a classic withdrawal of consumer
participation that rendered the city's segregated transit system
economically unviable. Passive cooperation involves non-interference
with social arrangements that may not directly involve movement
participants. The respecting of property rights, civil, and criminal law
are key examples of such passive cooperation. Abortion clinic blockaders
withdrew their cooperation from property and trespassing legal regimes,
making it impossible for those clinics to conduct business and
overburdening local police and courts.76 It is important to distinguish
disruptive acts from merely violent, unorthodox, or dramatic tactics.
Protesting in funny costumes can be unorthodox and spectacular. Large
"marches" on Washington, D.C. are usually dramatic, though decreasingly
so. Assaulting police officers at a protest is certainly violent. But
these acts do not necessarily pose a significant challenge to major
forms of "institutionally regulated cooperation" such industry,
commerce, governance, and basic law and order. [[By contrast, the
refusal]{.underline}]{.mark} to work---strikes---[[directly disrupts
industry]{.underline}]{.mark}. The refusal to purchase goods or
patronize businesses---boycotts---can directly disrupt commerce. [[The
mass refusal to abide by criminal law and police
authority]{.underline}]{.mark}---most dramatically in riots---[[can
disrupt virtually all the major functions of
society.]{.underline}]{.mark} If citizens refuse to work, buy, or obey,
it threatens the wealth, comfort, and safety of those in power. In such
cases, decisionmakers will need to wait the crises out, repress it, or
appease it through policy concessions.

James Madison argued in the Federalist \# 10 that government exists to
pursue the "public good" of providing order, liberty, and justice. While
the Federalists gave little shape to the amorphous concept of justice in
their papers and in the Constitution itself, the dual threats of anarchy
and tyranny put order and liberty front and center in their designs.
Madison and Hamilton devoted extended attention to arguing for a
government strong enough to control the populace and prevent anarchy,
while also checked and balanced to preserve individual liberties and
prevent tyranny. Assuring a balance between the "energy" to insure order
and the restraint to preserve liberty was the framers' central dilemma,
and it is one that persists today. When government exercises its core
law and order functions, the space for disruptive powers is generally
constrained, as perceptions of public danger, disorder, and nuisance are
necessarily those of the elites and/or ruling majorities. Alternatively,
the growth of judicial power has typically corresponded to a growth in
the civil rights and liberties of dissenters, opening opportunities for
disruptive protest. American history is full of examples of government
using heavyhanded police tactics to suppress and punish disruptive
dissent. The British opened fire on a colonial mob in the Boston
Massacre, and passed the \"Intolerable Acts\" to punish Bostonians for
the Boston Tea Party. George Washington used military force against the
so-called \"Whisky Rebellion\" and other challenges to the nascent
republic\'s fiscal authority. Escaped slaves in the antebellum
south---as well as black operators on the Underground Railroad---faced
whipping, hanging, or even burning if caught in their attempts to
undermine slavery. State and Federal forces, independently or in
conjunction with private forces like the Pinkertons, repeatedly broke
Progressive Era labor strikes with fist and club. [[Civil rights
marchers and freedom riders faced attack dogs, fire houses, beatings,
arson, and murder at the hands of police or police supervised white
mobs. In each case these events stick in our collective consciousness
because the government used or sanctioned extraordinary force again
dissenters. But in each case we also remember these conflicts because
government repression tended to add to the disruptive impact of the
movement. Many of these instances are cited by Piven as successful
examples of disruptive power at work]{.mark} (Piven F. F., Challenging
Authority, 2006).]{.underline} While some would concluded that the
decline in violent police confrontations with movement activists is
evidence of a system open to disruptive power, I caution that it may
denote the exact opposite. In this section I concentrate on the less
extraordinary laws, court rulings, and policing policies that subtly
constrain disruptive power without risking further conflagration. I
begin with in the late 1960s and the first of several federal efforts
dubbed the "war on crime."87

The Case for No Limits to Growth Notwithstanding all of the above, I
want to reassert that [by imagineering an alternative
future]{.underline}---based on solid science and technology--- we [can
create a situation in which there are "[no limits to
growth]{.mark}]{.underline}." [It [begins with]{.mark} a [new]{.mark}
paradigm for [food production]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[now under
development]{.underline}]{.mark}**: [the urban vertical
farm.]{.underline} This is a concept popularized by Prof. Dickson
Despommier of Columbia University.30 [[A]{.mark} 30-story urban
[vertical]{.mark}]{.underline} [[farm]{.mark} located on five square
acres could yield food **for fifty thousand people**]{.underline}. [We
are talking about high-tech installations that would multiply
productivity by a factor of 480]{.underline}: four growing seasons,
times twice the density of crops, times two growing levels on each
floor, times 30 floors = 480. [This means that **five acres** of land
can **produce the equivalent of 2,600 acres of conventionally planted
and tended crops**. Just 160 such buildings]{.underline} occupying only
800 acres [could feed the entire city of New York]{.underline}. Given
this calculus, **[an area [the size of Denmark could feed the entire
human race]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Vertical farms]{.mark} would be
self-sustaining.]{.underline} Located contiguous to or inside urban
centers, [they could also contribute to urban renewal.]{.underline}
[They would be urban lungs]{.underline}, [improving the air quality of
cities.]{.underline} [They would produce a varied food
supply]{.underline} [year-round]{.underline}. [They would **[use 90%
less water]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [Since agriculture consumes
two-thirds of the water worldwide, mass adoption of [this]{.mark}
technology [would solve humanity's water problem]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Food would no longer need to be transported to market]{.underline}; it
would be produced at the market [and would not require use of petroleum
intensive agricultural equipment. [This, **along with
less**]{.mark}**ened use of [pesticides]{.mark}, herbicides [and
fertilizers,]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[would]{.mark} not only [be better
for the environment]{.mark} but would eliminate agriculture's dependence
on petroleum [and]{.mark} **[significantly reduce petroleum
demand]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Despite increased efficiencies, direct
(energy) and indirect (fertilizers, etc.) energy use represented over
13% of farm expenses in 2005-2008 and have been increasing as the price
of oil rises.31 Many of [the world's damaged [ecosystems would be
repaired by]{.mark} the consequent [abandonment of
farmland]{.mark}]{.underline}. A "**[rewilding"]{.underline}** of our
planet would take place. [Forests, jungles and savannas would reconquer
nature, increasing habitat and becoming giant CO2 "sinks]{.underline},"
[sucking up]{.underline} the [excess CO2]{.underline} that the
industrial revolution has pumped into the atmosphere. [Countries
**already investigating**]{.underline} the adoption of [such technology
include Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and
China]{.underline}---countries that are water starved or highly
populated. Material Science, Resources and Energy [The]{.underline}
embryonic [revolution in material]{.underline} [science now taking place
is the key to "no limits to growth]{.underline}." I refer to "smart" and
superlight materials. [[Smart materials]{.underline}]{.mark} "are
materials that have one or more properties that can be significantly
changed in a controlled fashion by external stimuli." 32 They [can
produce energy by exploiting differences in temperature]{.underline}
(thermoelectric materials) [or by being stressed]{.underline}
(piezoelectric materials). Other smart materials save energy in the
manufacturing process by changing shape or repairing themselves as a
consequence of various external stimuli. [These materials have all
passed the "**proof of concept**" phase]{.underline} (i.e., are
scientifically sound) and many are in the prototype phase. [Some
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} **[already [commercialized and
penetrating]{.mark} [the market]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} For
example, the Israeli company [Innowattech has underlain a one-kilometer
stretch of local highway with]{.underline} piezoelectric [material to
"harvest]{.underline}" the [wasted stress energy of
vehicles]{.underline} passing over and convert it to electricity.33 They
reckon that [Israel has stretches of road that can efficiently produce
250 megawatts.]{.underline} If this is verified, consider the tremendous
electricity potential of the New Jersey Turnpike or the thruways of Los
Angeles and elsewhere. Consider the potential of railway and subway
tracks. [We are talking about tens of thousands of potential megawatts
produced without any fossil fuels.]{.underline} Additional energy is
derivable from [thermoelectric materials]{.underline}, which [can
transform wasted heat into electricity]{.underline}. As Christopher
Steiner notes, [capturing waste heat from manufacturing]{.underline}
alone [in the United States would provide an additional 65,000
megawatts]{.underline}: "enough for 50 million homes."34 [**Smart
glass** is]{.underline} [already commercialized and can save significant
energy]{.underline} in heating, airconditioning and lighting---up to 50%
saving in energy has been achieved in retrofitted legacy buildings (such
as the former Sears Tower in Chicago). New buildings, designed to take
maximum advantage of this and other technologies could save even more.
[Buildings consume 39% of America's energy and 68% of its
electricity]{.underline}. They emit 38% of the carbon dioxide, 49% of
the sulfur dioxide, and 25% of the nitrogen oxides found in the air.35
Even greater savings in electricity could be realized by replacing
incandescent and fluorescent light bulbs with LEDS which use 1/10th the
electricity of incandescent and half the electricity of fluorescents.
[These three steps]{.underline}: [[transforming waste heat into]{.mark}
[electricity,]{.mark} retrofitting buildings with [smart glass, and LED
lighting]{.mark}, [could cut America's]{.mark} electricity consumption
and its **[CO2 emissions by 50% within 10 years]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
They would also generate hundreds of thousands of jobs in construction
and home improvements. [Coal]{.underline} driven electricity generation
[would become a thing of the past.]{.underline} The coal released could
be liquefied or gasified (by new environmentally friendly technologies)
into the energy equivalent of 3.5 million barrels of oil a day. This is
equivalent to the amount of oil the United States imports from the
Persian Gulf and Venezuela together.36 [Conservation of energy and
parasitic energy harvesting]{.underline}, [as well as urban agriculture
would cut the planet's energy consumption and air and water pollution
significantly]{.underline}. **[[Waste-to-energy]{.mark} technologies
[could]{.mark} begin to [replace fossil fuels]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[Garbage, sewage, organic trash, and agricultural and food processing
waste]{.underline} are essentially hydrocarbon resources that can be
transformed into ethanol, methanol, and biobutanol or biodiesel. These
[can be used for transportation, electricity generation or as feedstock
for plastics and other materials]{.underline}. [Waste-to-energy
is]{.underline} essentially a [recycling of CO2 from the environment
instead of introducing new CO2]{.underline} into the environment.
[Waste-to-energy also prevents the production, and release]{.underline}
from rotting organic waste, [of **methane**]{.underline}---[a greenhouse
gas 25 times more powerful than CO2]{.underline}. Methane accounts for
18% of the manmade greenhouse effect. Not as much as CO2, which
constitutes 72%, but still considerable (landfills emit as much
greenhouse gas effect, in the form of methane, as the CO2 from all the
vehicles in the world). [Numerous [prototypes]{.mark} of a variety of
waste-to-energy technologies [are]{.mark} already [in
place.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[When]{.mark} their [declining costs
meet]{.mark} the [rising costs of fossil fuels]{.mark}, [they
will]{.mark} become commercialized]{.underline} [and,]{.underline} if
history is any judge, [will [replace fossil fuels **very
quickly**]{.mark}]{.underline}---just as coal replaced wood in a matter
of decades and petroleum replaced whale oil in a matter of years.
Superlight Materials But [it is superlight materials that have the
greatest potential to transform civilization and,]{.underline} in
conjunction with the above, to [usher in the "no limits to growth"
era]{.underline}. I refer, in particular, to car-bon
nanotubes---alternatively referred to as Buckyballs or Buckypaper (in
honor of Buckminster Fuller). [Carbon nanotubes are]{.underline} between
[1/10,000th]{.underline} and 1/50,000th the [width of a human
hair]{.underline}, [more flexible than rubber and 100-500 times stronger
than steel]{.underline} per unit of weight. Imagine the energy savings
if planes, cars, trucks, trains, elevators---everything that needs
energy to move---were made of this material and weighed 1/100th what
they weigh now. Imagine the types of alternative energy that would
become practical. Imagine the positive impact on the environment:
replacing many industrial processes and mining, and thus lessening air
and groundwater pollution. Present costs and production methods make
this impractical but that infinite resource---the human mind---has
confronted and solved many problems like this before. Let us take the
example of aluminum. A hundred fifty years ago, aluminum was more
expensive than gold or platinum.37 When Napoleon III held a banquet, he
provided his most honored guests with aluminum plates.
Less-distinguished guests had to make do with gold! When the Washington
Monument was completed in 1884, it was fitted with an aluminum cap---the
most expensive metal in the world at the time---as a sign of respect to
George Washington. It weighed 2.85 kilograms, or 2,850 grams. Aluminum
at the time cost \$1 a gram (or \$1,000 a kilogram). A typical day
laborer working on the monument was paid \$1 a day for 10-12 hours a
day. In other words, today's common soft-drink can, which weighs 14
grams, could have bought 14 ten-hour days of labor in 1884.38 Today's
U.S. minimum wage is \$7.50 an hour. Using labor as the measure of
value, [a soft drink can would cost \$1,125]{.underline} today (or
\$80,000 a kilogram), [were it not for a new method of processing
aluminum ore.]{.underline} The Hall-Héroult process turned aluminum into
one of the cheapest commodities on earth only two years after the
Washington Monument was capped with aluminum. Today aluminum costs \$3 a
kilogram, or \$3000 a metric ton. The soft drink can that would have
cost \$1,125 today without the process now costs \$0.04. [Today the
average cost of industrial grade carbon nanotubes is about \$50-\$60 a
kilogram.]{.underline} This is already far cheaper in real cost than
aluminum was in 1884. [Yet revolutionary methods of production are now
being developed that will drive costs down even more
radically.]{.underline} [[At Cambridge]{.underline}]{.mark} University
[[they are working on a]{.mark} new electrochemical production [method
that]{.mark} [could produce 600 kilograms]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} carbon [[nanotubes]{.underline} **[per
day]{.underline}**]{.mark} [at a projected cost of around \$10 a
kilogram]{.underline}, or \$10,000 a metric ton.39 This will do for
carbon nanotubes what the Hall-Héroult process did for aluminum.
**[[Nanotubes]{.mark} [will become the]{.mark} universal [raw material
of choice]{.mark}]{.underline}**, displacing steel, aluminum, copper and
other metals and materials. Steel presently costs about \$750 per metric
ton. Nanotubes of equivalent strength to a metric ton of steel would
cost \$100 if this Cambridge process (or others being pursued in
research labs around the world) proves successful. Ben Wang, director of
Florida State's High Performance Materials Institute claims that: "[If
you take just one gram of nanotubes,]{.underline} and you unfold every
tube into a graphite sheet, [you can cover about two-thirds of a
football field]{.underline}".40 Since other research has indicated that
[carbon [nanotubes would]{.mark}]{.underline} [[be more suitable than
silicon for]{.mark} producing]{.underline}
**[[p]{.underline}]{.mark}**hoto**[[v]{.underline}]{.mark}**oltaic
[energy,]{.underline} consider the implications. [Several
grams]{.underline} of this material [could be the]{.underline}
[energy-producing skin for new generations of superlight
dirigibles]{.underline}---making these airships energy autonomous. [They
could replace airplanes]{.underline} as the primary means to transport
air freight. Modern American history has shown that anything human
beings decide they want done can be done in 20 years if it does not
violate the laws of nature. The atom bomb was developed in four years;
putting a man on the moon took eight years. It is a reasonable
conjecture that **[[by]{.mark} [2020]{.mark} or earlier]{.underline}**,
**[[a]{.mark}n industrial [process for]{.mark} the [inexpensive]{.mark}
production of carbon [nanotubes will be]{.mark}
[developed]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and that this would be the key to
solving our energy, raw materials, and environmental problems all at
once. Mitigating Anthropic Greenhouse Gases Another vital component of a
"no limits to growth" world is to formulate a rational environmental
policy that saves money; one that would gain wide grassroots support
because it would benefit taxpayers and businesses, and would not
endanger livelihoods. For example, what do sewage treatment, garbage
disposal, and fuel costs amount to as a percentage of municipal budgets?
What are the costs of waste disposal and fuel costs in stockyards, on
poultry farms, throughout the food processing industry, and in
restaurants? How much aggregate energy could be saved from all of the
above? Some experts claim that we could obtain enough liquid fuel from
recycling these hydrocarbon resources to satisfy all the transportation
needs of the United States. [Turning]{.underline} the above [waste into
energy by various means would be a huge cost saver and value generator,
in addition to being a blessing to the environment.]{.underline}
[The]{.underline} U.S. [army has developed a portable field apparatus
that turns]{.underline} a combat unit's [human waste and garbage into
bio-diesel to fuel their vehicles and generators]{.underline}.41 It is
called TGER---the Tactical Garbage to Energy Refinery. [It eliminates
the need to transport fuel to the field]{.underline}, thus saving lives,
time, and equipment expenses. The cost per barrel must still be very
high. However, [the history of military technology being civilianized
and revolutionizing accepted norms is long]{.underline}. We might expect
that **[within 5-10 years]{.underline}**, [economically competitive
units using similar technologies will appear in restaurants, on farms,
and perhaps even in individual households]{.underline}, turning organic
waste into usable and economical fuel. We might conjecture that [within
several decades]{.underline}, [centralized sewage disposal and garbage
collection will be things of the past and that]{.underline} even [the
Edison Grid]{.underline} (unchanged for over one hundred years) **[will
be deconstructed]{.underline}**. The Promise of Algae [Biofuels produced
from [algae could]{.mark} eventually [provide]{.mark} a substantial
portion of [our transportation fuel]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
[[Algae]{.mark} has a much higher productivity potential than crop-based
biofuels because it [grows faster, uses less land and requires only
sun]{.mark}]{.underline} and [[CO2]{.mark} [plus]{.mark}]{.underline}
nutrients that can be provided from gray [[sewage]{.mark}
water]{.underline}. It is the primo CO2 sequesterer because it works for
free (by way of photosynthesis), and in doing so produces biodiesel and
ethanol in much higher volumes per acre than corn or other crops.
Production costs are the biggest remaining challenge. One Defense
Department estimate pins them at more than \$20 a gallon.42 But [once
commercialized in industrial scale facilities, production cost could go
as low as \$2 a gallon (the equivalent of \$88 per barrel of
oil]{.underline}) according to Jennifer Holmgren, director of renewable
fuels at an energy subsidiary of Honeywell International.43 Since algae
uses waste water and CO2 as its primary feedstock, its use to produce
transportation fuel or feedstock for product would actually improve the
environment. The Promise of the Electric Car There are 250 million cars
in the United States. Let's assume that they were all fully electric
vehicles (EVs) equipped with 25-kWh batteries. Each kWh takes a car two
to three miles, and if the average driver charges the car twice a week,
this would come to about 100 charge cycles per year. All told, Americans
would use 600 billion kWh per year, which is only 15% of the current
total U.S. production of 4 trillion kWh per year. If supplied during low
demand times, this would not even require additional power plants[. If
cars were made primarily out of Buckypaper, one kWh might take a car
40-50 miles.]{.underline} [If the surface of the car was utilized as a
photovoltaic, the car of the future might conceivably become **energy
autonomous**]{.underline} (or at least semi-autonomous). A kWh produced
by a coal-fired power plant creates two pounds of CO2, so our
car-related CO2 footprint would be 1.2 trillion pounds if all
electricity were produced by coal. However, burning one gallon of gas
produces 20 pounds of CO2.44 In 2008, the U.S. used 3.3 billion barrels
of gasoline, thereby creating about 3 trillion pounds of CO2. Therefore,
a switch to electric vehicles would cut CO2 emissions by 60% (from 3
trillion to 1.2 trillion pounds), even if we burned coal exclusively to
generate that power. Actually, replacing a gas car with an electric car
will cause zero increase in electric draw because refineries use seven
kWh of power to refine crude oil into a gallon of gasoline. A Tesla
Roadster can go 25 miles on that 7 KWh of power. So the electric car can
go 25 miles using the same electricity needed to refine the gallon of
gas that a combustion engine car would use to go the same distance.
Additional Strategies The goal of mitigating global warming/climate
change without changing our lifestyles is not naïve. Using proven
Israeli expertise, [[planting forests]{.mark} [on]{.mark} **just
[12%]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the world's [semi-arid areas would
offset]{.mark} the annual CO2 output of **[one thousand]{.mark}

[global program]{.underline} of foresting 60% of the world's semi-arid
areas **[would offset five thousand 500-megawatt coal
plants]{.underline}** (five gigatons a year). Since mitigation goals for
global warming include reducing our CO2 emissions by eight gigatons by
2050, [this project alone would have a tremendous ameliorating
effect]{.underline}. Given that large swaths of semi-arid land areas
contain or border on some of the poorest populations on the planet, [[we
could put millions]{.mark} of the world's poorest citizens [to
work]{.mark} in forestation, thus]{.underline} accomplishing two
positives ([fighting poverty and environmental degradation) with one
project]{.underline}. [[Moving]{.mark} agriculture from its current

The revolution underway in material science will help us to become
"self-sufficient" in energy. It will also enable us to create superlight

Meanwhile, [artificial photosynthesis will suck CO2 out of the air at
1,000 times the rate of natural photosynthesis.]{.underline}46 [This
trapped CO2 could then be combined with hydrogen to create much of the
petroleum we will continue to need]{.underline}. [As hemp and other

is unsustainable, and thus that we must proactively reduce the human
population to 3 billion-4 billion in order to "save the planet" and
human civilization from catastrophe. But [recent data indicates that a
**demographic winter** will engulf humanity by the middle of this
century.]{.underline} [[More than 60]{.mark}

population) [already [do not have replacement birth

entire EU, China, Russia, and half a dozen Muslim countries, including
Turkey, Algeria, and Iran. [[If]{.mark} present [trends
continue]{.mark}, India, Mexico and Indonesia will join this group
before 2030]{.underline}. [The human population will peak at
9]{.underline}-10 [billion by 2060]{.underline}, after which, for the
first time since the Black Death, it will begin to shrink[. [By the end
of the century, the]{.mark} human [population]{.mark} [might be]{.mark}
as low as [6 billion]{.mark}-7 billion.]{.underline} The real danger is
not a population explosion; but the consequences of the impending
population implosion.47 [This demographic process is]{.underline} [not
being driven by]{.underline} famine or disease as has been the case in
all previous history. Instead, it is being driven by the greatest
Cultural Revolution in the history of the human race: the **[liberation
and empowerment of women]{.underline}**. The fact is that [even with
**present technology**]{.underline}, [we would still be able to sustain

With this sort of example as inspiration, one hopes that scholars of
neoliberal nature would take on Castree\'s task. Yet one can anticipate
refusals (and this pertains directly to Castree\'s two final questions,
about the effects of nature\'s neoliberalization and their evaluation).
Some will argue that \`neoliberalism\' is constituted of a range of
diverse, locally rooted practices, thereby justifying a sector-specific,
case-study approach for which attempts at terminological systematization
are of little utility. This is, as Castree notes, an evasion rather than
a convincing response. [A more compelling argument is that [the
biophysical characteristics of resources and associated resource
economies differ so greatly that expedience]{.mark} (and analytical
rigour) [demands a high degree of specialization.]{.mark} But the most
fundamental objection (and one that Castree overlooks) is that [the
chain of causality in the study of environmental impacts arising
from]{.mark} projects of [neolib]{.mark}eralization [is so attenuated,
and]{.mark} the [confounding variables so numerous]{.mark} (particularly
given the multiple scales of regulation and resource production
involved), [that **it is almost impossible to prove that the
environmental \`impacts\' we might identify do indeed arise from a
particular strategy identified as neoliberal.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} [2007-9 [crisis]{.mark}]{.underline} in
global capitalism [[brought]{.mark} a new [energy]{.mark}]{.underline}
and focus to the heterodox economists, and more broadly [[to]{.mark} the
[critics]{.mark} of neoliberalism]{.underline} from different arenas of
society. It seemed clear at that time that neoliberalism had run its
course when it met its structural contradiction -- with the burst of the
US housing bubble and the concomitant financial crises across the world,
it looked like the avenues through which demand was being generated were
closed and the system was poised for structural change. [Three years
later]{.underline}, Southern Europe is witnessing an intense so-called
sovereign debt crisis with the working people bearing the brunt of it,
and real economies in the developed world are continuing to witness slow
growth. [The US seems]{.underline} [to be under the threat of
the]{.underline} so-called [fiscal cliff (]{.underline}which seems more
like a political event rather than an economic one). The
[economies]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [grew quickly during the
neo-liberal period, like China and India]{.underline}, [have slowed
down]{.underline} considerably. Across the globe, we seem to be going
through a period of uncertainty without a clear path ahead. **[[Yet,
neoliberalism persists]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Why? There are multiple
explanations for this. [[Bailout packages]{.underline}]{.mark} of
various governments were directed at rescuing financial capital, and
this has [[pitted]{.underline}]{.mark} the interests of [financial
[capital]{.mark} [against the]{.mark} interests of the
[majority]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark} global **[left has not
been strong enough]{.mark} [to take advantage of the
crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline} to better represent the interests of the
majority. [Governments across the world]{.underline}, after a brief gap,
[have returned to their neoliberal posture]{.underline} of supporting
financial capital and so forth. There is truth in all these
explanations. However, we need to broaden the array of explanations both
to take into account the spatial diversity of neoliberalism, as well as
to deepen our analytical understanding of this persistence. I offer one
such explanation from field explorations in India to add to the existing
explanations. This addition is not simply academic, but it shows the
need for deeper political engagement to bring about systemic change,
given that our explanations of the structural contradictions of
neoliberalism are on the mark. In two recent field visits that we (a
group of local researchers) undertook to understand the persistence of
neoliberalism at the concrete level, we found some interesting
phenomena. Both these visits were in the state of Andhra Pradesh in
South India. The first visit was in the region of Telangana, which is
highly politicized right now, as the people of the region are fighting
for a separate state within the Indian nation-state. The second visit
was to a tribal habitat in the northeastern region of the same state,
where communist struggles have been active for a while. In both these
areas, there are continued appropriations of common lands, common
resources and minerals, such as Granite and Bauxite by local and foreign
capitalist elites aided by the State. In the process, these elites are
destroying the local livelihoods without creating credible alternative.
Both these are classic cases of primitive accumulation or accumulation
by dispossession, a process that has centrally defined neoliberalism
over the last thirty-five years across the globe. [Accumulation by
dispossession]{.underline} operates in our times through the following
modes of appropriation. First, it [operates through the acquisition of
lands from small producers]{.underline} such as peasants, tribal people,
artisans and the urban poor in the name of Special Economic Zones and
the like. Some of the lands acquired thus, have became open to
speculative enterprises of real estate dealers. Second, [there has been
a large-scale privatization drive in most countries that has made public
sector enterprises alienate their properties at throwaway prices to
private players]{.underline}. Third, and these are the cases that we
have focused on -- [commons have been appropriated with
ease]{.underline} either [because the laws governing them are weak or
because common properties are often meddled with by the
State]{.underline}. What we found in these two regions is that the
particular modes of appropriation that have come into being with great
force during the neoliberal period have persisted even after the crisis.
Why is this the case? One explanation that ties in with the explanations
above is that resistance has not been strong enough or effective from
the people and their social movements or from the larger left movements.
The other explanation that we offered is [that [neoliberalism]{.mark}
has been able to [create]{.mark} [structures of populism that are
**deeply entrenched**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The local [[elites]{.mark}
have pursued a three-fold strategy for the continued appropriation of
the commons]{.underline}. First, [they]{.underline} (with the support of
the State) [have put in [place]{.mark} various [populist policy]{.mark}
[imperatives]{.mark}]{.underline} [[that]{.mark} have temporarily
[addressed]{.mark} the consumption [needs of the
majority]{.mark}]{.underline} without altering the deeper neoliberal
structural forces that have inhibited employment growth and wage growth
over the last thirty years. For example, there are schemes such as
housing or subsidized food for the poor even as their productive
resources such as land are acquired by the elites/states. These have
tended to perpetuate themselves after the global crisis, even with the
loud demands for austerity. Second, [the elites have [continued to
appropriate]{.mark} common and public [resources to keep their own
accumulation]{.mark} levels [above an acceptable minimum]{.mark} in a
time of slowdown of accumulation opportunities [through]{.mark} regular
[economic growth.]{.mark}]{.underline} Resistance is sought to be
controlled through populism of the kind discussed above. Even in regions
that are highly politicized, such as Telangana, the leadership of the
movement has been hand-in-glove with the local elites who gain
consistently through the perpetuation of these appropriation
practices.Third, [professionals and [middle classes have]{.mark} [been
the beneficiaries of a system that has thrived on the]{.mark} creation
of [enclave economies]{.mark}]{.underline} [where there is a sharing of
rents among the elites and these professional group]{.underline}s. These
professional classes have taken up key positions in the government,
media, corporate executive roles, and as intermediaries between the
elites and the working people who use the commons. The [**[broad support
of]{.mark} these [classes ]{.mark}**[for]{.mark} the [local
elites]{.mark} [has]{.mark} [played a **key**]{.mark} **role [in the
perpetuation of neoliberalism]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As long as these
processes persist, [[neoliberalism will be strong]{.mark} on the ground,
[with]{.mark} the **[elites and non-elites bound together]{.mark}** in
the larger neoliberal system through the different]{.underline}, yet
entangled processes of appropriation, rent sharing and populism. Of
course, this cannot go on, since the logic of austerity is bound to
create contradictions in the path of populism. However, this
contradiction may unfold very differently across space and time, as not
all governments are going to react identically to the demands of
austerity. The 1% in the US (that the Occupy movement has targeted) or
the top decile of the population (in countries like China and India)
continue to benefit from the perpetuation of the neoliberal
configuration while they are pitted against their large majorities. As
long as the political groups on the ground do not make their voices
heard loudly enough against the top 1% or the top 10%, and [[as long as
there]{.mark} [are]{.mark} continued [benefits]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the
[elites]{.mark} from the perpetuation of neoliberalism, [**the system
will persist**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

##  AT -- Case

###  AT -- "X Cant Access Protest"

#### People without access to the public sphere can still gain sovereignty through the assembly of others -- protests can be representational for those without the right to appear

THESE ACTS OF SELF-MAKING or self-constitution are not the same as
representing a people who are already fully formed. [The term "the
people" does not only represent a preexisting collection of people; if
it did]{.underline}, the term would postdate the production of the
collectivity itself. Indeed, the term can never adequately represent a
collectivity that is in the process of being made or making
itself---both its inadequacy and its self-division are part of its
enacted meaning and promise[. The discursive invocation of the "we"
refers then to a people whose needs, desires, and demands are not yet
fully known, and whose coming together is bound up with a future that is
yet to be lived out]{.underline}. Indeed, [such practices of
self-determination are not quite the same as [acts of
self-representation]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [yet both of these [are at
work in exercising the freedom of assembly in which "we the people" is
spoken or enacted]{.mark} in some way. [That enactment is
performative]{.mark} inasmuch [as it brings into being the people whom
it names]{.mark}, or it calls upon them to gather under the utterance.
And this means that performative actions such as these are part of the
process called political self-determination]{.underline}, designations
of who we are that are also, at the same time, engaged in making that
very "we." Further[, the invocation of ["we" separates popular
sovereignty from state sovereignty]{.mark}; it names and inaugurates
that separation time and again]{.underline}. [[The plurality]{.mark}
always [breaks with those]{.mark} who are elected, or [whose election is
questionable]{.mark} to us, or in relation to a state whose
representatives we have never had the choice to elect]{.underline}, as
is the clear case under occupation and for the undocumented and the
partial or noncitizen. So, [something that must fail as representation,
and that we might call nonrepresentational and nonrepresentative, nearly
tautological, becomes the basis of democratic forms of political
self-determination]{.underline}---popular sovereignty, distinct from
state sovereignty, or, rather, popular sovereignty precisely as it
intermittently distinguishes itself from state sovereignty. [Popular
sovereignty makes sense only in this perpetual act of separating from
state sovereignty]{.underline}; thus[, [it is a way of forming a people
through acts of]{.mark} self-designation and
[self-gathering]{.mark}]{.underline}; [these are repeated enactments
verbal and nonverbal, bodily and virtual, undertaken across different
spatial and temporal zones, and on different kinds of public stages,
virtual realities, and shadow regions]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark}
vocalized [performative, "we the people," is]{.mark} surely [part
of]{.mark} the enactment we are calling
[self-constitution]{.mark}]{.underline}, but this figure cannot be taken
as a literal account of how political self-determination works. Not
every act of political self-determination can be translated into that
verbal utterance---such a move would make the verbal domain more
privileged than any other. In fact, [the enactment of political
self-determination is necessarily a crossing of the linguistic and the
bodily, [even if the action is silent]{.mark} and the body is
sequestered]{.underline}. How do we, for instance, understand the hunger
strike if not precisely as the practiced refusal of a body that cannot
appear in public?10 This means that appearing in public in a bodily form
is not an adequate figure for political self-determination. At the same
time, the hunger strike that is not reported and represented in public
space fails to convey the power of the act itself. [Prisoner networks
are precisely those forms of solidarity that do not, cannot, appear in
public in a bodily form, relying predominantly on digital media reports
with few, if any, images.]{.underline} Those networks of prisoners,
activists, lawyers, and extended kin and social relations, whether in
Turkey, in Palestinian prisons and detention camps, or at Pelican Bay in
California, are also [[forms of "assembly]{.mark}" in which those with
suspended citizenship exercise a form of freedom through strikes,
petitions, and forms of legal and political representation. [Even as
they do not appear]{.mark}, are not allowed to appear, they [are]{.mark}
nevertheless [exercising a certain right to appear]{.mark} in public,
either before the law or [in public space]{.mark}, objecting precisely
to the interdiction against appearing in public that is the condition of
imprisonment]{.underline}. Given all this, let us recapitulate what this
means and does not mean for rethinking the freedom of assembly in
relation to popular sovereignty: (1) [[popular sovereignty]{.mark} is
thus a form of reflexive self-making that is [separate from the]{.mark}
very representative [regime]{.mark} it legitimates]{.underline}; (2) [it
arises in the course of that very separation]{.underline}; (3) [it
cannot legitimate any particular regime without being separate from
it]{.underline}, that is, partially uncontrolled by a regime and not
operationalized as its instrument, and yet it is the basis from which
legitimate government is formed through fair and inclusive elections;
and (4[) its act of self-making is actually a series of spatially
distributed acts, ones that do not always operate in the same way and
for the same purposes.]{.underline} Among the most important of these
spatial distinctions is that between the public sphere and spheres of
forcible confinement, including the prison where political prisoners,
those who have exercised freedom of assembly and freedom of speech, are
contained and subjugated. The passage into and out of the public sphere
is regulated precisely by legal and police power and the institution of
the prison. Further, (5) [the enactment of "we the people" may or may
not take linguistic form; [speech and silence]{.mark}, movement and
immobility, [are all political enactments]{.mark}]{.underline}; the
hunger strike is precisely the inverse of the fed body standing freely
in the public domain and speaking---it marks and resists the deprivation
of that right, and it enacts and exposes the deprivation that prison
populations undergo. The invocation of the people becomes---and must
become---contestable at the very moment that it appears. [["Appearance"
can designate]{.mark} visible [presence]{.mark}, spoken words, but also
networked representation and concerted acts of silence]{.underline}. A
differential form of power that takes both spatial and temporal forms
establishes who may be part of such an enactment and the means and
methods of such enactments. [Confinement implies being spatially
separated from public assemblies]{.underline}, but also involves the
duration of the sentence, or the unknowable duration of indefinite
detention. Since the public sphere is constituted in part through sites
of forcible sequestering, [[the borders that define the public]{.mark}
are also those that [define the confined]{.mark}, the sequestered, the
imprisoned, the expelled, and the disappeared]{.underline}. Whether we
are speaking about the borders of the nation-state where the
undocumented are confined within refugee encampments, where rights of
citizenship are denied or indefinitely suspended, or about prisons where
indefinite detention has become the norm[, the interdiction against
[appearing]{.mark}, moving, and speaking [in public becomes the
precondition of embodied life]{.mark}.]{.underline} The prison is not
exactly the inverse of the public sphere, since prisoner advocacy
networks traverse the walls of the prison[. Forms of prisoner
[resistance are forms of enactment]{.mark} that by definition cannot be
part of the public square, though through networks of communication and
proxy representation, they surely can]{.underline}. And yet, no matter
how virtual we want to think the public sphere (and there are many good
reasons for thinking that), the prison remains the limit case of the
public sphere, marking the power of the state to control who can pass
into the public and who must pass out of it. Thus, the prison is the
limit case of the public sphere, and that freedom of assembly is haunted
by the possibility of imprisonment. One may be imprisoned for what one
says or one may be imprisoned simply for assembling. Or one may be
imprisoned for writing or teaching about assemblies or about freedom
struggles, or for teaching about popular struggles for sovereignty, such
as teaching about the Kurdish freedom movement in Turkish universities.
All of these are reasons why those with the freedom to appear can never
fully or adequately represent the people, since there are people who, we
know, are missing from the public, missing from this public assembled
here in Gezi Park; [they are those who must find representation, even as
those who seek to represent them risk imprisonment for doing
so]{.underline}. And it is not just that there are some people who
happen to be missing from the gathering because they had something else
to do; rather, there are those who could not have gathered in Gezi Park,
or can no longer gather, or who are indefinitely restrained from
gathering. That very power of confinement is a way of defining,
producing, and controlling what will be the public sphere and who will
be admitted to public assembly. It works alongside privatization as a
process that seeks to make public space into the entrepreneurial field
of the market-driven state. So though we may wonder why it is that
crowds that gather to oppose privatization are broken up and dispersed
by police force, gassing and physical assault, we have to remember that
[the state that is off-loading public space to private
enterprise]{.underline}, or that now makes such decisions according to
market values, is involved in at least two ways of controlling and
decimating public space. Some lament that a movement that begins by
opposing privatization inevitably becomes a movement that opposes police
violence. But let us try to see that [[the seizure of public
space]{.mark} from popular sovereignty [is]{.mark} precisely [the aim
of]{.mark} both privatization and police [assaults on]{.mark} freedom of
[assembly]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this way as well, the market and the
prison work together in a prison industry that, as Angela Davis has
clearly shown, works to regulate rights of citizenship---and in the
United States this happens in irrefutably racist ways as black men
continue to constitute the vast majority of prisoners.11 We can add that
the market and the prison work together as well to constrict, decimate,
and appropriate public space, severely qualifying Hannah Arendt's notion
of "the right to appear." That said, I want to return to the theoretical
point about freedom of assembly in order to suggest some of the
political implications of how we think. My inquiry began with the
following questions: In what sense is freedom of assembly a punctual
expression of popular sovereignty? And does it have to be understood as
a performative exercise, or what Jason Frank calls "the small dramas of
self-authorization"?12 I began by suggesting that [[the performative
power of the people does not]{.mark} first [rely on words]{.mark}.
Assembly only makes sense if bodies can and do gather or connect in some
way, and then speech acts that unfold from there articulate something
that is already happening at the level of the plural body]{.underline}.
But let us remember that [vocalization is also a bodily act, as is sign
language, and this means that there is no speaking without the body
signifying something, and sometimes the body signifies something quite
different from what a person actually says]{.underline}.

### AT -- Non-Black

#### Non-black people confronting how their complacency in whiteness perpetuates anti-black suffering is key for addressing the issue -- when non-black debaters address the illegitimacy of the USfg or when they confront the reality of gratuitous violence enacted upon black folk, that's good, especially because white people are in a unique position that enables ignoring their direct relation to anti-black violence. This obviously does not absolve white students of how they contribute to anti-blackness, but it a necessary starting point.

In the last several years, [[the notion of complicity has]{.mark} also
been a recurrent theme in critical theories]{.underline} of race and
racism, as well as in feminist theory. [Questions about complicity have
[arisen]{.mark} in discussions around \"internalized racism\" and,
[especially, in debates]{.mark}]{.underline} about whether victims of
racism can be implicated in their own oppression.8 Feminist theorists
who have tried to understand how women can perpetuate their own
oppression have also turned their attention to questions of complicity.9
[Recently, however, [another type]{.mark} [of complicity has appeared
in]{.mark} the [scholarship that focuses on the ways that]{.mark} the
[systemically privileged,]{.mark} rather than the marginalized, [are
complicit in the perpetuation of systemic injustice]{.mark}. In the
field of critical whiteness studies, for instance, [questions of
complicity are especially notable in the academic discourse around
social justice]{.mark} education.]{.underline} Here we find a claim
about [complicity that is addressed to all white people regardless of
and despite of their good intentions. What I refer to as \"the white
complicity claim\" maintains that white people, through the practices of
white-ness and by benefiting from white privilege, contribute to the
maintenance of systemic racial injustice.]{.underline} However, [the
claim also implies responsibility in its assumption that the failure to
acknowledge such complicity will thwart whites in their efforts to
dismantle unjust racial systems and, more specifically, will contribute
to the perpetuation of racial injustice.° Recognizing that one is
complicit, according to the claim, is a necessary]{.underline} (albeit
not sufficient) [condition of challenging systemic racial
oppression]{.underline}. Most significantly, since the white complicity
claim presumes that racism is often perpetuated through well-intended
white people, being morally good may not facilitate and may even
frustrate the recognition of such responsibility. What does it mean to
claim that white people are complicit in the reproduction of racist
systems despite their good intentions and even when they might want to
renounce the privileges they accrue because of their whiteness? [How can
white people be responsible for their complicity if they cannot choose
to be not white? Even if white people are well intended, even if they
consider themselves to be paragons of anti-racism, how might they still
be unwittingly complicit in sustaining an unjust system they claim to
want to dismantle?]{.underline} What is of specific interest about white
complicity is the claim that white people can reproduce and maintain
racist practices even when, and especially when, they believe themselves
to be morally good. Some feminist philosophers have been acutely aware
of this problem. Marilyn Frye queries, \"Does being white make it
impossible for me to be a good person?\" Similarly Linda Mar-tin Alcoff
asks What is it to acknowledge one\'s whiteness? \... (is) it to
acknowledge that one is inherently tied to structures of domination and
oppression, that one is irrevocably on the wrong side?\'2 I take an
important cue from Fiona Probyn\'s provocative assertion that
\"[[Complicity]{.mark} . . . [is the starting point and the condition of
ethics itself]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}[\' Thus, this project not
only explores the meaning of complicity presumed by the white complicity
claim, it also considers the notion of moral responsibility that is
attributable to white people in the context of such
complicity.]{.underline} This book will be of particular interest to
those who practice and research social justice pedagogy. White denials
of complicity are particularly wide-spread in courses that teach about
social justice. Not unlike the ordinary German who denied being guilty
of complicity with Nazi crimes, [[white students]{.mark} [often conflate
complicity with guilt]{.mark}, the guilt that arises from direct
causality to harm. [Such notions]{.mark} of responsibility support and
[encourage denials of complicity. White students believe]{.mark} that
[they are justified in denying their complicity because they
claim]{.mark} that [they]{.mark} [do not have any \"bad intentions\" or
any \"causal connection]{.mark}\" to the harms of systemic racism.
[Often white students refuse to even engage with the possibility that
they are complicit]{.mark}. Most white students see themselves as good
people and take the charge of complicity as a serious affront to their
moral being. They perceive their moral being as transcending their
whiteness.]{.underline} Denials of complicity go deep and are
maintained, as will be demonstrated, by certain conceptions of
responsibility. Moreover, currently \"white privilege pedagogy\" is the
prevailing approach in social justice education, especially in schools
of education across North America. Yet the notion of privilege that is
the focal point of such pedagogy, as will be explained in Chapter 2, is
extremely problematic.\" Instead, [this book advocates \"white
complicity pedagogy\" that highlights and compensates for some of the
more problematic aspects of white privilege pedagogy. White complicity
pedagogy is premised on the belief that to teach systemically
privi-leged students about systemic injustice, and especially in
teaching them about their privilege, [one must first encourage them
to]{.mark} be willing to [contemplate how they are complicit in
sustaining the system even when they]{.mark} do not intend to or [are
unaware that they do]{.mark} so. This means helping white students to
un-derstand that white moral standing is one of the ways that whites
benefit from the system. It also means linking such benefits to their
complicity even when such links might not be specifically causal ones.
Acknowledging that one is complicit, however, does not relieve one of
responsibility but rather, as Probyn insists, **[complicity is where
responsibility begins]{.mark}**. [If privileged social groups]{.mark}
are to [take responsibility]{.mark} for their role in the perpetuation
of systemic injustice [and]{.mark} be able to [form effective political
coalitions with the marginalized,]{.mark} both [understanding white
complicity]{.mark} and the type of white moral responsibility it entails
[require elucidation]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

###  AT -- Protest Bad

#### The right to assemble precedes any other right granted to the people -- sovereignty through assembly is critical to withdraw from and question illegitimate structures that don't act in the name of the people

[That assembly may be called ["the people]{.mark}" or it may be one
version of "the people"]{.underline}---they do not speak in one voice or
even in one language. But [they [are beings with the capacity to move
with]{.mark} [whatever]{.mark} technical and infrastructural [supports
they require to do so]{.mark}]{.underline} (this is, importantly, an
insight from disability studies that has concrete implications for
thinking through public assembly). And that means that [they can resolve
to stand still, not to move, even to become immoveable in their desires
and their demands.]{.underline} [[The power to move]{.mark} or be still,
to speak and to act, [belongs to the assembly prior to]{.mark}, and in
excess of, [whatever rights a particular government decides to
confer]{.mark} or to protect. The [coming together]{.mark} of a crowd
[has]{.mark}]{.underline}, as John Inazu contends, "[[an expressive
function]{.mark}" prior to any particular claim or utterance it may
make.4 [That]{.mark} very power of [government may]{.mark} well [become
what freedom of assembly opposes]{.mark}]{.underline}, and at that
moment, [we see the operation of a form of [popular sovereignty]{.mark}
that [is distinct from state sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline}, and whose
task it is to distinguish itself from the latter. How, then, do we think
about the freedom of assembly and popular sovereignty? I know that some
people have come to consider "sovereignty" a bad word, one that
associates politics with a singular subject and a form of executive
power with territorial claims. Sometimes it is used as synonymous with
mastery, and other times with subordination. Perhaps it carries other
connotations, though, that we would not want to lose altogether. One
only needs to consider debates about native sovereignty in Canada or
read the important work of J. Kēhaulani Kauanui on the paradoxes of
Hawaiian sovereignty to see [how crucial this notion can be for popular
mobilizations.5 [Sovereignty can be one way of describing]{.mark} acts
of [political self-determination]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is why
[popular [movements]{.mark} of indigenous people struggling for
sovereignty [have become important]{.mark} ways to lay claim to space,
[to move]{.mark} freely, to express one's views, and [to seek]{.mark}
reparation and [justice]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although elections are the
way that government officials are supposed to represent popular
sovereignty (or the "popular will" more specifically), [the meaning of
popular sovereignty has never been fully exhausted by the act of
voting.]{.underline} Of course, voting is essential for any concept of
popular sovereignty, but [the exercise of sovereignty neither begins nor
ends with the act of voting]{.underline}. As democratic theorists have
argued for some time, elections do not fully transfer sovereignty from
the populace to its elected representatives---something of [popular
sovereignty always remains nontransferable,]{.underline} marking the
outside of the electoral process. If not, there would be no popular
means of objecting to corrupt electoral processes. In a sense, [[the
power of the populace remains separate from]{.mark} the power of [those
elected]{.mark}]{.underline}, even after they have elected them, for
only in its separateness can it continue to contest the conditions and
results of elections as well as the actions of elected officials. [If
the sovereignty of the people is fully transferred to, and replaced by,
those whom the majority elect, then what is lost are those powers we
call critical, those actions we call resistance, and that lived
possibility we call revolution]{.underline}. So "popular sovereignty"
certainly translates into electoral power when the people vote, but that
is never a full or adequate translation. Something [of popular
[sovereignty]{.mark} remains untranslatable, nontransferable, and even
unsubstitutable, which is why it [can both elect and dissolve
regimes]{.mark}]{.underline}. As much as popular sovereignty legitimates
parliamentary forms of power[[, it also retains the power to withdraw
its support from those]{.mark} same [forms when they prove to be
illegitimate.]{.mark}]{.underline} If parliamentary forms of power
require popular sovereignty for their very legitimacy, they also surely
fear it, for [there is something about popular sovereignty that runs
counter to, and exceeds or outruns, every parliamentary form that it
institutes and grounds. An \[[A]{.mark}\] elected [regime can be]{.mark}
brought to a halt or [overcome by that assembly of people who speak "in
the name of the people]{.mark}," enacting the very "we" that holds final
legitimating power under conditions of democratic rule]{.underline}. In
other words, the conditions of democratic rule depend finally on an
exercise of popular sovereignty that is never fully contained or
expressed by any particular democratic order, but which is the condition
of its democratic character. This is an extraparliamentary power without
which no parliament can function legitimately, and that threatens every
parliament with dysfunction or even dissolution. We may again want to
call it an "anarchist" interval or a permanent principle of revolution
that resides within democratic orders, one that shows up more or less
both at moments of founding and moments of [[dissolution]{.mark}, but
[is]{.mark} also [operative in the freedom of assembly]{.mark}
itself]{.underline}.

#### The right to have rights predates, and is independent from, any political institution- Those excluded from sovereign structures can weaponize the right to appear in order to combat criminal regimes of the law-While the public sphere is built on exclusion and regulated modes of disavowal, performing the right to appear allows assemblages to call the state's legitimacy into question- the body's performance against state forces solidifies one's right to persist, a right not guaranteed by the law but rather the right to have rights

Luckily, I think [Arendt]{.underline} did not consistently follow this
model from The Human Condition, which is why, for instance, in the early
1960s, she [turned again to [the fate of refugees and the
stateless]{.mark}, and came [to assert in a new way the right to have
rights]{.mark}]{.underline}.9 **[[The right to have rights is one that
depends on no existing particular political organization for its
legitimacy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Like the space of appearance, [the
right to have rights]{.mark} predates and [precedes any political
institution that might codify]{.mark} or seek [to guarantee that
right]{.mark}]{.underline}; at the same time, [it is derived from no
natural set of laws]{.underline}. **[[The right comes into being when it
is exercised]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and exercised **[[by those who
act]{.mark} in concert, [in alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Those who
are excluded from existing polities, who belong to no nation-state
or]{.mark} other contemporary [state formation]{.mark}, may be deemed
"unreal"]{.underline} only by those who seek to monopolize the terms of
reality. And yet, [even after the public sphere has been defined through
their exclusion, **they act**]{.underline}. [[Whether they are abandoned
to precarity or left to die through systematic negligence, concerted
action still emerges from their acting together]{.underline}]{.mark}.
And this is what we see, for instance, [when [undocumented workers amass
on the street without the legal right to do so]{.mark}]{.underline};
when squatters lay claim to buildings in Argentina as a way of
exercising the right to livable shelter; when populations lay claim to a
public square that has belonged to the military; [when [refugees take
part in collective uprisings demanding shelter, food, and rights of
sanctuary]{.mark}]{.underline}; [when [populations amass, without the
protection of the law and without permits to demonstrate, to bring down
an unjust or criminal regime of law]{.mark} or to protest
austerity]{.underline} measures that destroy the possibility of
employment and education for many. [Or when those whose public
appearance is itself criminal]{.underline}---transgendered people in
Turkey or women who wear the veil in France---[appear in order to
contest that criminal status and assert the right to
appear.]{.underline} The French law that prohibits "ostentatious"
religious display in public as well as the hiding of the face seeks to
establish a public sphere where clothing remains a signifier of
secularism and the exposure of the face becomes a public norm. [[The
prohibition]{.mark} against hiding the face [serves a]{.mark} certain
[version of the right to appear]{.mark}, understood as [the right for
women to appear unveiled]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [At the same
time, it denies the right to appear for that very group of women,
requiring them to defy religious norms in favor of public
ones]{.underline}. That required act of religious disaffiliation becomes
obligatory when the public sphere is understood as one that overcomes or
negates religious forms of belonging. The notion, prevalent in French
debate, that women who wear the veil cannot possibly do so from any
sense of choice operates in the debate to veil, as it were, the blatant
acts of discrimination against religious minorities that the law enacts.
For one choice that is clearly made among those who wear the veil is not
to comply with those forms of compulsory disaffiliation that condition
the entrance to the public sphere. Here as elsewhere, [the sphere of
appearance is highly regulated]{.underline}. [That these women be
clothed in some ways rather than others constitutes a sartorial politics
of the public sphere, but so too does compulsory "unveiling," itself a
sign of belonging first to the public]{.underline} and only secondarily,
or privately, to the religious community. This is especially pronounced
in relation to Muslim women whose affiliations to various versions of
public, secular, and religious domains may well be coterminous and
overlapping. [And it shows quite clearly that what is called ["the
public sphere"]{.mark} in such cases [is built up through constitutive
exclusions and compulsory forms of
disavowal]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} **[Paradoxically, the act of
[conforming to a law that requires unveiling is the means by which
a]{.mark} certainly highly compromised, even [violent, "freedom to
appear" is established]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Indeed, in the public
demonstrations that often follow from acts of public mourning---as often
occurred in Syria before half of its population became refugees, where
crowds of mourners became targets of military destruction---we can see
how [[the existing public space is seized by those who have no existing
right to gather there]{.mark}, who emerge from zones of disappearance to
become bodies [exposed to violence and death in the course of gathering
and persisting publicly as they do]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [it is
their right to gather, free of intimidation and the threat of violence,
that is systematically attacked by the police, the army, hired gangs, or
mercenaries. [To attack those bodies is to attack the right itself,
since when those bodies appear and act, they are exercising a
right]{.mark}]{.underline} outside, against, and in the face of the
regime. Although [[the bodies on the street are vocalizing their
opposition to the legitimacy of the state]{.underline}]{.mark}, [they
are also, by virtue of occupying and persisting in that space without
protection, posing their challenge in corporeal terms, which means that
when the body "speaks" politically, it is not only in vocal or written
language.]{.underline} The persistence of [[the body in its exposure
calls that legitimacy into question and does so precisely through a
specific performativity of the body]{.underline}]{.mark}.10 Both action
and gesture signify and speak, both as action and claim; the one is not
finally extricable from the other. **[[Where the legitimacy of the state
is brought into question]{.mark} precisely by that way of appearing in
public, [the body]{.mark} itself exercises a right that is no right; in
other words, it [exercises a right that is being actively contested and
destroyed by military force and]{.mark} that, in its resistance to
force, [articulates its way of living, showing both its precarity and
its right to persist]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [[This right]{.mark} is
codified nowhere]{.underline}. [It [is not granted]{.mark}]{.underline}
from elsewhere or [[by]{.mark} existing [law]{.mark}, [even if it
sometimes finds support]{.mark} precisely [there. It is]{.mark}, in
fact, [the right to have rights]{.mark}]{.underline}, not as natural law
or metaphysical stipulation, but [as the persistence]{.underline} of the
body [[against those forces that seek its]{.mark}]{.underline}
debilitation or [[eradication]{.underline}]{.mark}. This persistence
requires breaking into the established regime of space with a set of
material supports both mobilized and mobilizing.

#### The conception of individualism ignores the obligation that individuals have towards each other -- every inhabitant does not only belong to communities but also the world itself -- we all have a commitment to each other and a right to a livable life through the aff's new form of politics

Most scholars would want to keep any consideration of [Emmanuel
Levinas]{.underline} separate from an analysis of Hannah Arendt: He [is
a philosopher of ethics]{.underline}, drawing on religious traditions,
[and]{.underline} he [emphasizes the ethical importance of passivity and
receptivity]{.underline}; she [\[Arendt\] is a social and political
philosopher]{.underline}, adamantly secular, who emphasizes time and
again the political value of action. Why bring a discussion of Levinas
together with one regarding Arendt? [Both [Levinas and Arendt take issue
with]{.mark} the [classically liberal conception of
individualism]{.mark}]{.underline}, that is, the idea that
[[individuals]{.underline}]{.mark} knowingly [[enter
into]{.underline}]{.mark} certain contracts, [and [their
obligation]{.mark} follows [from having deliberately]{.mark} and
volitionally [entered into agreements with one
another]{.mark}]{.underline}. This view assumes that we are only
responsible for those relations, codified by agreements, into which we
have knowingly and volitionally entered. And Arendt disputes this view.
Indeed, it was the substance of the argument that she made against Adolf
Eichmann. He thought he could choose which populations should live and
die, and in this sense he thought he could choose with whom to cohabit
the earth. What he failed to understand, according to Arendt, is that
[[no one has the prerogative to choose with whom to cohabit the
earth]{.underline}]{.mark}. We can choose in some ways how and where to
live, and in local ways we can choose with whom to live. But if we were
to decide with whom to cohabit the earth, we would be deciding which
portion of humanity may live and which may die. If that choice is barred
to us, that means that we are under an obligation to live with those who
already exist, and that [any choice about who may or may not live is
always a genocidal practice]{.underline}; and though we cannot dispute
that genocide has happened, and happens still, [we are wrong to think
that freedom in any ethical sense is ever compatible with the freedom to
commit genocide]{.underline}. The unchosen character of earthly
cohabitation is, for Arendt, the condition of our very existence as
ethical and political beings. Hence, to exercise that prerogative of
genocide is not only to destroy political conditions of personhood but
to destroy freedom itself, understood not as an individual act but as a
plural action. Without that plurality against which we cannot choose, we
have no freedom and, therefore, no choice. This means that [[there is an
unchosen condition of freedom]{.mark} and [that]{.mark}, in being free,
[we affirm something about what is unchosen for us]{.mark}.]{.underline}
If freedom seeks to exceed that unfreedom that is its condition, then we
destroy plurality and we jeopardize, in her view, our status as persons,
considered as zoon politikon. This was one argument that Arendt made
about why the death penalty was justified for Eichmann. In her view,
Eichmann had already destroyed himself by not realizing that his own
life was bound to those he destroyed, and individual life makes no
sense, has no reality, outside of the social and political framework in
which all lives are equally valued.3 In Eichmann in Jerusalem (1963),
Arendt argues that Eichmann and his superiors failed to realize that
[the [heterogeneity of]{.mark} the [earth's population is an
irreversible condition of social and political life]{.mark}]{.underline}
itself.4 So Arendt's accusation against Eichmann bespeaks a firm
conviction that none of us may exercise such a prerogative, that those
with whom we cohabit the earth are given to us, prior to choice and so
prior to any social or political contracts we might enter into through
deliberation and volition. In Eichmann's case, the effort to choose with
whom to cohabit the earth was an explicit effort to annihilate some part
of the population---Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, communists, the
disabled, and the ill, among others---and so the exercise of freedom
upon which he insisted was genocide. Not only is this choice an attack
on cohabitation as a precondition of political life in Arendt's view,
but it commits us to the following proposition: we must devise
institutions and policies that actively preserve and affirm the unchosen
character of open-ended and plural cohabitation. Not only do we live
with those we never chose and with whom we may feel no immediate sense
of social belonging, but we are also obligated to preserve those lives
and the open-ended plurality that is the global population. [Although
Arendt would doubtless dispute my view]{.underline}, I think what [she
has offered is an ethical view of cohabitation that serves as a
guideline for particular forms of politics]{.underline}. In this sense,
concrete political norms and policies emerge from the unchosen character
of these modes of cohabitation. The necessity of cohabiting the earth is
a principle that, in her philosophy, must guide the actions and policies
of any neighborhood, community, or nation. The decision to live in one
community or another is surely justified as long as it does not imply
that those who live outside the community do not deserve to live. In
other words, [every communitarian ground for belonging is only
justifiable on the condition that it is subordinate to a
noncommunitarian opposition to genocide.]{.underline} The way I read
this, **[[every inhabitant who belongs to a community belongs also to
the earth]{.underline}]{.mark}**---a notion she clearly takes from
Heidegger---and **[[this implies a commitment not only to every other
inhabitant of that earth but]{.mark}, we can surely add, [to sustaining
the earth itself]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And with this last proviso, I
seek to offer an ecological supplement to Arendt's anthropocentrism. In
Eichmann in Jerusalem, Arendt speaks not only for the Jews but for any
and every other minority who would be expelled from habitation on the
earth by another group. The one implies the other, and the "speaking
for" universalizes the founding interdiction even as it does not
override the plurality whose life it seeks to protect. One reason
[Arendt]{.underline} refuses to separate the Jews from the other
so-called nations persecuted by the Nazis is that she [is arguing in the
name of a plurality coextensive with human life in any and all of its
cultural forms]{.underline}. At the same time, her judgment of Eichmann
is one that emerges precisely from the historical situation of a
diasporic Jew who was herself a refugee from Nazi Germany, but who also
objected to the Israeli courts representing a specific nation, when the
crime, in her view, was a crime against humanity, and to [the
courts]{.underline} representing [only the Jewish victims of the
genocide, when there were many other groups annihilated and
displaced]{.underline} in accord with the Nazi policy formulated and
implemented by Eichmann and his cohorts. [[This same notion of unchosen
cohabitation implies]{.mark}]{.underline} not only the irreversibly
plural or heterogeneous character of the earth's population, and [[an
obligation to safeguard that plurality]{.underline}]{.mark}, but
[[also]{.mark} a commitment [to an equal right to inhabit the
earth]{.mark} and so a commitment to equality as well]{.underline}.
These two dimensions of her discussion took specific historical form in
her argument against the idea of Israel as a state based on principles
of Jewish sovereignty and for a federated Palestine in the late 1940s.
The political conception of plurality for which she fought was, in her
view, implicit in the American Revolution, and it led her to refuse to
accept exclusively national, racial, or religious grounds for
citizenship. Moreover, [[she objected to the founding of any state that
required the expulsion of its inhabitants]{.mark} and the production of
a new refugee class, especially [when such a state invoked the rights of
refugees to legitimate its founding]{.mark}.]{.underline} Arendt's
normative views are these: [**[there is no one part of the population
that can claim the earth for itself, no community or nation-state or
regional unit, no clan, no party, and no race]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
This means that unwilled proximity and unchosen cohabitation are
preconditions of our political existence, the basis of her critique of
nationalism, the obligation to live on the earth and in a polity that
establishes equality for a population necessarily and irreversibly
heterogeneous. Indeed, unwilled [proximity]{.underline} and unchosen
cohabitation also [serve as the basis of our [obligation]{.mark}s not to
destroy any part of the human population and to outlaw
genocide]{.underline} as a crime against humanity, [but also [to invest
institutions with the demand to seek to make all lives
livable]{.mark}]{.underline} and equally so. Thus, from unchosen
cohabitation, [[Arendt derives notions of universality and equality that
commit us to institutions that seek to sustain human lives without
regarding]{.underline}]{.mark} some part of [[the population as socially
dead]{.underline}]{.mark}, as redundant, or as intrinsically unworthy of
life and therefore ungrievable. Arendt's views on cohabitation,
federated authority, equality, and universality, elaborated from the
1940s through the 1960s, stood in stark contrast to those who were
defending nationalist forms of Jewish sovereignty, differential
classifications for Jewish and non-Jewish citizens, military policies to
uproot Palestinians from their lands, and efforts to establish a Jewish
demographic majority for the state. It is often taught that Israel
became a historical and ethical necessity for the Jews during and after
the Nazi genocide, and that anyone who questions the founding principles
of the Jewish state shows an extraordinary insensitivity to the plight
of the Jews; but [there were Jewish thinkers and political activists at
the time, including Arendt, Martin Buber, Hans Kohn, and Judah Magnes,
who thought that [among the most important lessons of the Nazi genocide
was an opposition to]{.mark} illegitimate state violence, to [any state
formation that sought to give electoral priority and citizenship to one
race or religion]{.mark}, and that nation-states ought to be
internationally barred from dispossessing whole populations who fail to
fit the purified idea of the nation.]{.underline} For those who
extrapolated principles of justice from the historical experience of
internment and dispossession, [[the political aim is to extend equality
regardless of cultural background or formation]{.underline}]{.mark},
across languages and religions, to those none of us ever chose (or did
not recognize that we chose) [and]{.underline} with whom **[[we have
an]{.underline}]{.mark}** enduring **[[obligation to find a way to
live]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For whoever "we" are, we are also those who
were never chosen, who emerge on this earth without everyone's consent,
and who belong, from the start, to a wider population and a sustainable
earth. And **[[this condition]{.underline}]{.mark}**, paradoxically,
[[yields]{.mark} the [radical potential for new modes of sociality and
politics beyond the]{.mark} avid and wretched [bonds formed through
settler colonialism and expulsion]{.mark}]{.underline}. [We are
all]{.underline}, in this sense, the unchosen, but we are nevertheless
[unchosen together]{.underline}. It is not uninteresting to note that
Arendt, herself a Jew and refugee, understood her obligation not to
belong to the "chosen people" but, rather, to the unchosen, [and to make
mixed community precisely among those whose **[existence implies a right
to exist and to lead a livable life.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### Precarity gains intelligibility exclusively when recognizing bodily dependence, human needs, and vulnerability as political issues- because conditions which determine livable life are intrinsically tied to concrete political institutions so too must the solutions we generate be grounded in notions of material precarity- this is the only ethical strategy to combat genocide and sustain life.

ARENDT'S EURO-AMERICAN FRAMEWORK was clearly limited, and yet another
limitation becomes clear if we try to understand the relationship of
precarity to practices of cohabitation. For Arendt, the needs of the
body are to be relegated to the private sphere. [[Precarity]{.mark} only
[makes sense if we are able to identify bodily dependency]{.mark} and
[need, hunger]{.mark} and the [need for shelter,]{.mark} the
[vulnerability to injury and destruction, forms of social trust that let
us live]{.mark} and thrive, [and]{.mark} the [passions linked to
our]{.mark} very [persistence as]{.mark} clearly [political
issues]{.mark}.]{.underline} If Arendt thought that such matters had to
be relegated to the private realm, [Levinas]{.underline} understood the
importance of vulnerability but [failed to really link vulnerability to
a politics of the body]{.underline}. Although Levinas seems to
presuppose a body impinged upon, he does not give it an explicit place
in his ethical philosophy. And though [Arendt theorizes the problem of
the body, of the located body, [the speaking body emerging into the
"space of appearance" as part of any account of political
action]{.mark}, she is not quite willing to affirm a politics that
struggles to overcome inequalities in food distribution, that affirms
rights of housing, and that targets inequalities in the sphere of
reproductive labor]{.underline}. In my view, some ethical claims emerge
from bodily life, and perhaps [all ethical claims presuppose a bodily
life]{.underline}, understood as injurable, one that is not
restrictively human. After all, the life that is worth preserving and
safeguarding, that should be protected from murder (Levinas) and
genocide (Arendt), is connected to, and dependent upon, nonhuman life in
essential ways; this follows from the idea of the human animal, as
Derrida has articulated it, which becomes a different point of departure
for thinking about politics. [[If we try to understand]{.mark} in
concrete terms [what it means to commit ourselves to preserving the life
of the other]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[we are]{.underline}]{.mark}
invariably [[confronted]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the bodily conditions of
life and]{.underline} so to [[a commitment]{.underline}]{.mark} not only
to the other's corporeal persistence but [[to all those environmental
conditions that make life livable.]{.mark}]{.underline} In the so-called
private sphere delineated in Arendt's The Human Condition, we find the
question of needs, the reproduction of the material conditions of life,
and the problems of transience, reproduction, and death
alike---everything that pertains to precarious life. [[The possibility
of whole populations being annihilated through]{.mark} either [genocidal
policies or systemic negligence follows]{.mark} not only [from]{.mark}
the fact that there are [those who believe that they can decide with
whom they will inhabit the earth]{.mark}, but also because such thinking
presupposes a disavowal of an irreducible fact of politics:]{.underline}
the vulnerability to destruction by others that follows from [a
condition of precarity in all modes of political and social
interdependency.]{.underline} We can make this into a broad existential
claim, namely, that everyone is precarious, and this follows from our
social existence as bodily beings who depend upon one another for
shelter and sustenance and who, therefore, are at risk of statelessness,
homelessness, and destitution under unjust and unequal political
conditions. As much as I am making such a claim, I am also making
another, namely, that [[our precarity is]{.mark} to a large extent
[dependent upon the organization of economic and social relationships,
the presence]{.mark} or absence [of]{.mark} sustaining infrastructures
and [social and political institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}. So as soon
as the existential claim is articulated in its specificity, it ceases to
be existential. And since it must be articulated in its specificity, it
was never existential. In this sense, [[precarity is indissociable from
that dimension of politics that addresses the organization and
protection of bodily needs]{.underline}]{.mark}. Precarity exposes our
sociality, the fragile and necessary dimensions of our interdependency.
Whether explicitly stated or not, [every political effort to manage
populations involves a tactical distribution of precarity]{.underline},
more often than not articulated through an unequal distribution of
precarity, [one that depends on dominant norms regarding whose life is
grievable and worth protecting and whose life is
ungrievable]{.underline}, or marginally or episodically grievable, and
so, in that sense, already lost in part or in whole, and thus less
worthy of protection and sustenance. [[My point is not to rehabilitate
humanism but]{.underline}]{.mark}, rather, [[to struggle for a
conception of ethical obligation that is grounded in
precarity]{.underline}]{.mark}. No one escapes the precarious dimension
of social life---it is, we might say, the joint of our nonfoundation.
And [[we cannot understand cohabitation without understanding that a
generalized precarity obligates us to oppose genocide and to sustain
life]{.mark} on egalitarian terms.]{.underline} Perhaps this feature of
our lives can serve as the basis for the right of protection against
genocide, whether through deliberate or negligent means. After all, even
though our interdependency constitutes us as more than thinking beings,
indeed as social and embodied, vulnerable and passionate, [our thinking
gets nowhere without the presupposition of the interdependent and
sustaining conditions of life.]{.underline}

###  AT -- No Vulnerability

#### Injection and embracement of precarity is key to stop the re-entrenchment of this violence towards those deemed vulnerable and prevent self-defeating movements -- the body's vulnerability, once exposed by regimes of power, allows for the mobilization of mass political resistance

That [[action]{.underline}]{.mark}, I would suggest, [[has to be
supported through solidarity]{.underline}]{.mark}, to be sure, [[but
also by infrastructural conditions, by law]{.mark}, and by the absence
of violent or coercive efforts to thwart the way]{.underline}. The
struggles I mentioned above presume that bodies have been constrained
and are at risk of constraint, that they can be without work and without
mobility, that they can suffer violence and forms of coercion. Am I
trying to say that bodies are not active, but vulnerable? Or that even
vulnerable bodies can act? My argument, in fact, is that [[it would be
as mistaken to think of the body as primarily or definitionally active
as it would be to think of the body as primarily and definitionally
vulnerable and inactive]{.underline}]{.mark}. If we have to have a
definition, it will [depend]{.underline}, rather, [on being able to
think vulnerability and agency together.]{.underline} I am especially
aware of how counterproductive it can be to understand women's bodies as
particularly vulnerable. We immediately enter into uncertain terrain,
given the long and lamentable gender politics that allocates the
distinction between passive and active to women and men, respectively.
Yet, [[if we say that certain groups are differentially vulnerable, we
are only saying that under certain regimes of power, some groups are
targeted more readily than others]{.underline}]{.mark}, some suffer
poverty more than others, some are exposed to police violence more than
others. We are making a sociological observation that would have to be
backed up in one way or another. And yet, [that sociological claim can
very easily become a new norm of description]{.underline}, at which
point women become defined by their vulnerability. At such a point,
[[the very problem that the description is meant to address becomes
reproduced and ratified by the very]{.mark} description]{.underline}.
This is one reason we have to pay attention to what it means to mobilize
vulnerability, and what it means, more specifically, to mobilize
vulnerability in concert. For many of us, that is, for many people, the
moment of actively appearing on the street involves a deliberate risk of
exposure. Perhaps the word "exposure" helps us think vulnerability
outside the trap of ontology and foundationalism. This is especially
true for those who, exposed, appear on the street without permits, who
are opposing the police or the military or other security forces without
weapons. Although one is shorn of protection, to be sure, one is not
reduced to some sort of "bare life." There is no sovereign power
jettisoning the subject outside the domain of the political as such; on
the contrary, there is a more varied and diffuse operation of power and
force that detains and encroaches on bodies in the street or in the cell
or on the periphery of towns and borders---[and this is a specifically
political form of destitution.]{.underline} Of course, feminist
theorists have for a long time argued that women suffer social
vulnerability disproportionately.9 And though there is always a risk in
claiming that women are especially vulnerable---given how many other
groups are entitled to make the same claim, and given that the category
of women is intersected by class, race, age, and a number of other
vectors of power and sites of potential discrimination and
injury---there is still something important to be taken from this
tradition. The claim can sometimes be taken to mean that women have an
unchanging and defining vulnerability, and that kind of argument makes
the case for paternalistic provisions of protection. [If women are
regarded as especially vulnerable and seek protected status, it becomes
the responsibility of the state or other paternal powers to provide that
protection.]{.underline} According to that model, [feminist
activism]{.underline} not only petitions paternal authority for special
dispensations and protections, but affirms that inequality of power that
situates women in a powerless position and, by implication, men in a
more powerful one. And where it does not simply or exclusively put "men"
in the position of providing protection, it [invests state structures
with the paternalistic obligation to facilitate the achievement of
feminist goals. Such a view is very different from one that
claims]{.underline}, for instance, that women are at once vulnerable and
capable of resistance, and that [vulnerability and
resistance]{.underline} can, and do, and even [must happen at the same
time]{.underline}, as we see in certain forms of feminist self-defense
and institutions (battered women's shelters, for example) that seek to
provide protection without enlarging paternalistic powers, and as
happens through networks that support trans women in Turkey or anywhere
the expanded and expandable category of women suffers harassment or
injury by virtue of appearing as it does. Of course, there are good
reasons to argue for the differential vulnerability of women; they
suffer disproportionately from poverty and illiteracy, two very
important dimensions of any global analysis of women's conditions (and
two reasons why none of us will be "postfeminist" until such time as
these conditions are fully overcome). But many of the feminists who have
made the turn to vulnerability, as it were, have done so in order to
increase the protected standing of women in human rights organizations
and international courts. This juridification of the feminist project
seeks to prioritize the language needed to strengthen such an appeal to
the courts. [As important as such [appeals]{.mark} may be, they [provide
a limited language for]{.mark} understanding feminist forms of
resistance that are popular and extralegal, **the [dynamics of mass
movements, civil society initiatives, and forms of political
resistance]{.mark} informed and [mobilized by vulnerability. The need to
establish a politics that avoids the retrenchment of paternalism seems
clear]{.mark}. At the same time, [if this resistance to paternalism
objects to all state and economic institutions]{.mark} that provide
social welfare, [then the demand for infrastructural support
becomes]{.mark} illegible within its terms, even
[self-defeating]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Hence, this task is made all the
more difficult under conditions of increasing precarity in which ever
greater numbers of people are exposed to homelessness, unemployment,
illiteracy, and inadequate health care. [The struggle, in my view, is
how to make the feminist claim effectively that such institutions are
crucial to sustaining lives at the same time that feminists resist modes
of paternalism that reinstate and naturalize relations of
inequality.]{.underline} So though the value of vulnerability has been
important to feminist theory and politics, this does not mean that
vulnerability serves as a defining characteristic of women as a group.
[I would oppose this effort to install a new norm for the category of
women that rests on a foundational notion of vulnerability]{.underline}.
Indeed, the very debate about who belongs to the group called "women"
marks a distinct zone of vulnerability, namely, those who are
non--gender conforming, and whose exposure to discrimination,
harassment, and violence is clearly heightened on those grounds. So some
provisionally bound group called "women" is neither more vulnerable than
a provisionally bound group called "men" nor is it particularly useful
or true to try to demonstrate that women value vulnerability more than
men do. Rather[, certain kinds of gender-defining attributes, like
[vulnerability and invulnerability, are distributed unequally under
certain regimes of power]{.mark}, and precisely for the purpose of
shoring up certain regimes of power that disenfranchise
women]{.underline}. We think about goods as distributed unequally under
capitalism as well as natural resources, especially water, but we should
also surely consider that one way of managing [populations]{.underline}
is to [distribute vulnerability unequally such that "[vulnerable
populations" are established within discourse and
policy]{.mark}]{.underline}. More recently, we note that [social
[movements and]{.mark} policy [analysts refer to precarious populations,
and that political strategies are accordingly devised to think about
ameliorating conditions of precarity]{.mark}.10 But [this]{.mark} same
[demand is]{.mark} also [made through broad popular struggles]{.mark}
that both expose and mobilize precarity, [showing]{.mark}]{.underline},
as it were, **[[the possibilities of performative political action that
emerge in the midst of precarity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It seems clear
that **[[if the designation of vulnerability or precarity effaces this
form of political demand, it further entrenches the very condition from
which it seeks alleviation.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### Certain populations are deemed disposable and therefore subject to violence- our political transformation is a balance between personal responsibilities and the idea of vulnerability- this resolves the assumption that anything which is met with retaliation elicits vulnerability

**Butler '18** (Judith Butler, writes comparative literature on gender
theory and is a gender theorist who works at UC Berkeley, Hannah Arendt
Chair at the European Graduate School, Developed the theory on Gender
Performativity, LGBTQ activist, "Notes Toward A Performative Theory of

There is of course an even more sinister way of wielding both categories
of precarity and of vulnerability. Within the terms of both military and
economic policy, [[certain populations are]{.mark} effectively [targeted
as]{.mark} injurable]{.underline} (with impunity) [or
[disposable]{.mark}]{.underline} (living on in a disposable condition or
no longer living, quite literally disposed of, a distinction that
constitutes an interval in the time-space of social death).
[[This]{.mark}]{.underline} kind of explicit or implicit marking [[is
used to justify]{.mark} the [infliction of injury upon]{.mark} such
[populations]{.mark}]{.underline} (as we see in times of war, or in
state violence against undocumented citizens). So "[vulnerability" can
be a way of targeting a population for decimation]{.underline}. This has
produced a paradox within neoliberalism and its notion of
"[[responsibilization]{.underline}]{.mark}" that [[designates such
populations as accountable for their own precarious
position]{.underline}]{.mark}, or their accelerated experience of
precaritization. [As a counter to this nefarious form of
moralizing]{.underline}, human rights advocates have defended [[the idea
of vulnerability]{.underline}]{.mark} as they [[insist on the need for
legal and institutional protection for such groups]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The notion of [[vulnerability]{.mark} here works in two ways, to target
a population or to protect it, which means]{.underline} that [the term
has been used to [establish a restrictive political logic]{.mark}
according [to which being targeted and being protected are the only two
alternatives]{.mark}]{.underline}. We can see that [[the
term]{.underline}]{.mark}, so deployed, effectively [[effaces both
popular movements]{.underline}]{.mark} (if not forms of popular
sovereignty) [[and]{.mark} active struggles for [resistance and social
and political transformation]{.mark}.]{.underline} We may think that
these two ways of using the notion of vulnerability are antithetical,
and they are, but only within the terms of a problematic logic, one that
displaces some other forms of political rationality and practice that
are arguably more pressing and more promising. So targeting and
protecting are practices that belong to the same rationale of power. [If
precarious populations have produced their own situation, then they are
not situated within a regime of power that reproduces precarity in
systemic ways]{.underline}. Their own actions, or their own failures,
are the cause of their precarious situations. If they are seen as in
need of protection, and if paternalistic forms of power (which sometimes
do include philanthropy and humanitarian NGOs) seek to install
themselves in permanent positions of power to represent the powerless,
then [those very populations are excluded from democratic processes and
mobilizations.]{.underline} [[The answer to this dilemma is neither to
position precarious populations as hyperresponsible]{.mark} on a moral
model [nor]{.mark}, conversely, [to position them as suffering
populations]{.mark} in need of "care" by good Christians]{.underline}
(as the social democratic discourse in France, with its implicit
affiliation with Christian values, currently maintains). [**[This
approach takes vulnerability and invulnerability as political
effects]{.underline}**,]{.mark} unequally distributed effects of a field
of power that acts on and through bodies; these swift inversions show
that [vulnerability and invulnerability are]{.underline} not essential
features of men or women, but, rather, processes of gender formation,
[the effects [of modes of power]{.mark} that have as one of their aims
the production of gender differences along lines of
inequality]{.underline}. We can see evidence of this rationale when, for
instance, [[masculinity is said to be "attacked" by
feminism]{.underline}]{.mark}---in which case [[it is masculinity in the
"vulnerable" position]{.underline}]{.mark}---or [[when the general
public is said to be "attacked" by sexual and gender
minorities]{.underline}]{.mark} of various kinds, or when the state of
California is now understood to be "under attack" because it has lost
its white majority, or when the state of Arizona is said to be "under
attack" by its Latino population, and so trying to establish an ever
more impermeable border to the south. Various European nationalities are
now said to be "under attack" by new immigrant communities, at which
point dominant groups and their racist representatives are construed as
occupying a vulnerable condition.

#### Vulnerability can be mobilized to create an active form of political resistance -- interdependency is necessary for assembly in order to create a livable life

[[WHEN THOSE WHO FACE]{.mark} ACCELERATING prospects of
[precarity]{.mark} take to the streets and [begin their claim with "we
the people,"]{.mark} then [they are asserting that they]{.mark}, those
who appear and speak there, [are identified as "the
people]{.mark}."]{.underline} They are working to ward off the prospect
of oblivion. [The phrase does not imply]{.underline} that those who
profit are not "the people," and it does not necessarily imply [a simple
sense of inclusion: "we are the people, too." It can mean, "we are still
the people"---therefore, still persisting and not yet
destroyed]{.underline}. Or **[[it can assert]{.mark} a form of [equality
in the face of]{.mark} increasing [inequality; participants do
this]{.mark} not simply by uttering that phrase, but [by embodying
equality to whatever extent]{.mark} that [proves possible, constituting
an assembly of the people]{.mark} on the grounds of
equality]{.underline}**. One might say, equality is experimentally and
provisionally asserted in the midst of inequality, to which critics
respond: this is vain and useless, since their acts are only symbolic,
and true economic equality continues to become more elusive for those
whose debts are astronomical and employment prospects foreclosed. And
yet, it seems that [the embodiment of equality [in]{.mark} the
[practices of assembly, the insistence on interdependency and]{.mark} a
fair distribution of labor tasks, [the notion of a commonly held
ground]{.mark} or "the commons," all [start to put into the world a
version of equality that is rapidly vanishing in other
quarters]{.mark}.]{.underline} **[[The point is not to regard the body
merely as an instrument for making a political claim]{.mark}, [but to
let]{.mark} this body, [the plurality of bodies, become the precondition
of all further political claims]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Indeed, in the
politics of the street that has been with us in the last years, in
**[[the Occupy Movement, Tahrir Square]{.mark} in its early stages,
[Puerta del Sol, Gezi Park, and the favela movement in Brazil, the basic
requirements of the body are at the center of political
mobilizations]{.mark}]{.underline}**---those requirements are, in fact,
publicly enacted prior to any set of political demands. Over and against
forces of privatization, the destruction of public services and the
ideals of the public good precipitated by the takeover of neoliberal
forms of rationality in governance and everyday life, [bodies
require]{.underline} food and shelter, protection from injury and
violence, and [the freedom to move, to work]{.underline}, to have access
to health care; [[bodies require other bodies for support and for
survival]{.underline}]{.mark}.14 It matters, of course, what age those
bodies are, and whether they are able-bodied, since [in all forms of
dependency, bodies require not just one other person, but social systems
of support that are complexly human and technical.]{.underline} It is
precisely in a world in which the supports for bodily life of increasing
numbers of people are proving to be highly precarious that bodies are
emerging together on the pavement or the dirt or along the wall that
separates them from their land---[this assembly, which can include
virtual participants, still assumes a set of interlocking locations for
a plural set of bodies]{.underline}. And in this way, the bodies belong
to the pavement, the ground, the architecture, and the technology by
which they live and move and work and desire. Although there are those
who will say that active bodies assembled on the street constitute a
powerful and surging multitude, one that in itself constitutes a radical
democratic event or action, I can only partially agree with that view[.
[When the people break off from established power, they enact the
popular will]{.underline}]{.mark}, though to know that for certain, we
would have to know who is breaking off, and where, and who does not
break off, and where they are. There are, after all, all sorts of
surging multitudes I would not want to endorse (even if I do not dispute
their right to assemble), and they would include lynch mobs,
anti-Semitic or racist or fascist congregations, and violent forms of
antiparliamentary mass movements. I am less concerned with the
ostensible vitality of surging multitudes or any nascent and promising
life force that seems to belong to their collective action than I am
with joining a struggle to establish more sustaining conditions of
livability in the face of systematically induced precarity and forms of
racial destitution. [The final aim of politics is not simply to surge
forth together]{.underline} (though this can be an essential moment of
affective intensity within a broader struggle against precarity),
[constituting a new lived sense of the "people," even if sometimes, for
the purposes of radical democratic change---which I do endorse---[it is
important to surge forth in ways that claim and alter the attention of
the world for some more enduring possibility of livable life for
all]{.mark}.]{.underline} [It is one thing to feel alive, or to affirm
aliveness, and yet another to say that that fleeting sense is all that
we can expect from politics. [Feeling alive is not quite the same as
struggling for a world in which life becomes livable]{.mark} for those
who have not yet been valued as living beings.]{.underline} Although I
understand that something has to hold such a group together, some
demand, some felt sense of injustice and unlivability, some shared
intimation of the possibility of change, [there is also a desire to
produce a new form of sociality on the spot. [These mobilizations make
their claims through language, action, gesture, and movement; through
linking arms; through refusing to move]{.mark}; through forming bodily
modes of obstruction to police and state authorities. A given movement
can move in and out of the space of heightened exposure, depending on
its strategies and the military and police threats it must
face.]{.underline} In each of these cases, however, we can say that
these bodies form networks of resistance together, remembering that
[[bodies who are active agents of resistance are also fundamentally in
need of support]{.underline}]{.mark}. In resistance, [vulnerability is
not precisely converted into agency---it remains the condition of
resistance, a condition of the life from which it emerges, the condition
that, rendered as precarity, has to be opposed, and is
opposed.]{.underline} This is something other than weakness or
victimization, since, for the precarious, [[resistance requires]{.mark}
exposing the abandoned or unsupported dimensions of life, but also
[mobilizing that vulnerability as a deliberate and active form of
political resistance]{.mark}, an exposure of the body to power in the
plural.]{.underline}

###  AT -- No black criminality 

#### Negrophobia mobilizes black criminalization which is a weapon of white supremacy and Black de-valuation.

While this film has been characterized as a cinematic masterpiece, it
greatly advanced the aims of White Supremacy. In particular, this film
had a deleterious effect on African American males because they were
depicted as brutes whose sole intent in life was to rape White women and
destroy the White man's way of life (Loewen, 2007). [As an effective Ku
Klux Klan recruitment tool, this film galvanized support for the Klan as
the preeminent savior of White southern civilization. So far-reaching
was the negative effects of this movie for African American people,
during a private White House screening by-then President Woodrow Wilson,
he reportedly described the film as painting an accurate portrait of
African Americans]{.underline} (Loewen, 2007). In short, this film was a
catalyst for most of the early 20th century media caricatures of African
Americans that still exist today (Baker, 1996; Menzel- Baker, Motley, &
Henderson, 2004). The aforementioned images of African Americans have
contributed to what Armour (1997) calls **[[Negrophobia, or an
irrational fear of African Americans]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This
irrational fear **[[has contributed to Whites' general desensitization
to African American suffering of all types as well as decreased support
for social safety nets. Thus, African American males are devalued and
seen as expendable]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Burrell, 2010).
Unfortunately, **[[Black as a metaphor for criminality is so deeply
embedded in the minds of societal members that Whites have reported
seeing an African American criminal suspect at the scene of a crime when
none was actually present]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Chaney & Robertson,
2013b; Leverentz, 2012; Oliver & Fonash, 2002). In a study to determine
the effect of network news images on viewer perceptions, Dixon (2008)
found that exposure to network news depressed estimates of African
American income, increased the endorsement of stereotypes of African
Americans as poor and intimidating, and were associated with higher
racism scores**[. Media characterizations of violent criminals as Black
has been deeply etched in the psyche of many viewers]{.underline}**
(Dixon & Maddox, 2005; Leverentz, 2012; Oliver & Fonash, 2002; Oliver,
Jackson, Moses, & Dangerfield, 2004). **[Such]{.underline}** negative
**[portrayals]{.underline}** of African Americans in media **[have
resulted in wanton stereotyping, extreme fear of African Americans, and
African Americans with darker complexions and more Afrocentric
phenotypic features being perceived as more worthy of the death penalty
in research experiments]{.underline}** (Blair, Judd, & Chapleau 2004;
Chaney & Robertson, 2013b; Dixon, 2008; Eberhardt, Davies,
Purdie-Vaughns, & Johnson, 2006; Maddox & Gray, 2002; Peffley & Hurwitz,
2013). All of **[[the aforementioned serve to legitimize White
supremacy]{.mark}, legitimize White life, [and de-legitimize African
American life]{.mark} so that incidents of police violence against
African Americans are not punished nor viewed as a larger societal
problem.]{.underline}**

#### In the courthouse, Blackness is always already criminalized and blamed.

Since **[[members of law enforcement play a pivotal role in maintaining
White Supremacy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, it should not come as a surprise
that **[[Whites are generally desensitized to police use of excessive
force against African Americans in general, and African American
men]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in particular. In a recent poll administered
by the 2014 General Social Survey conducted by the independent research
center the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of
Chicago, seven of ten White Americans polled posited they could envision
a condition in which they would endorse an officer striking an adult
male citizen. On the contrary, slightly more than four of ten African
Americans (42%) and slightly less than four of ten Latinos (38%) would
approve of such an action (Holland, 2015). **[In an analysis of accounts
of more than 12,000 police homicides from 1980 to 2012 contained in the
FBI's supplementary homicide report, young African American men (ages
15- 19) were twenty-one times more likely to get killed by police than
their White counterparts]{.underline}** (Gabrielson, Jones, & Sagara,
2014). Additionally, the analysis found that African American police
officers account for only 10% of police killings and 78% of their
victims are African American whereas White officers killed 91% of Whites
who died at the hands of police and were responsible for 68% of deaths
of people of color at the hands of police (Gabrielson et al., 2014).
Even more disturbing is the fact that the above figures are a gross
under-representation as police departments are not required to submit
records of fatal shootings. In fact, **[several police departments have
not submitted data regarding the number and/or circumstances of fatal
shootings to the FBI in years.]{.underline}** For instance, New York
City has not submitted fatal shooting data to the FBI since 2007
(Gabrielson et al., 2014). Generally speaking, **[[police officers do
not serve time for killing African American men]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
According to analysis by The Washington Post and Bowling Green State
University, which was based on public records and interviews with law
enforcement and legal experts, **[it was discovered that officers were
only charged 54 times for killing civilians since 2005]{.underline}**
(Kindy & Kelly, 2015). Also, **[more than three-fourths of the officers
charged were White and two-thirds of the victims were people of color
(all but two were African Americans)]{.underline}**. [Forty-three of the
charged involved the following variables/factors: (1) A victim was shot
in the back; (2) there was a video recording of the incident; (3)
incriminating testimony from fellow officers; or (4) allegations of a
cover-up (Kindy & Kelly, 2015). Of the 54 instances in which officers
were charged, 35 had their cases resolved (21 were acquitted or cases
were dropped) and when convicted they served an average of four years
behind bars, some only a few weeks]{.underline} (Kindy & Kelly, 2005).
Consequently, **[[juries and Whites in general have trouble seeing
African Americans as "true" victims and thus may find it more difficult
to acknowledge Blacks' humanity]{.mark} (]{.underline}**Feagin, 2014;
Fukurai, Butler, & Krooth, 1993; Fukurai, & Krooth, 2003; Tonry, 2011).
As of April 15, 2015, unofficially 255 African Americans have been
killed by agents of law enforcement in the United States in 2015 (Doy
News, 2015). This statistic almost certainly represents an
under-estimate since there is no standardized database on police
killings of African Americans (Chaney & Robertson, 2013a; Gabrielson et
al. 2014). The lack of a large-scale governmental response to this
incessant problem represents a major judicial blemish on the United
States. When examined from a socio-historical context, it appears that
the slave patrols that were a fixture of early policing in America have
not ended, have gained greater force, and that ultimately, the lives of
this nation's African American citizens do not matter.

#### Police brutality emblemizes the inherent dangerousness present in Blackness.

[**[There are four ways that the murders of unarmed Blacks support the
superiority of Whites]{.underline}**.]{.mark} For
[**[one,]{.underline}** **[the murder of unarmed Blacks carries forward
and solidifies the racist legacy of citizen slave patrols that were
initiated during slavery]{.underline}**]{.mark} (Blackmon, 2009;
Dulaney, 1996; Reichel, 1999; Robertson, 2014). Even though castrations,
whippings, maimings, and lynchings (Dulaney, 1996; Loewen, 2005;
Robertson, 2014; Ward, 2012) were frequently used in the South as a
method of policing the activities of African American men from
1880-1950, the transition of these activities to murder by guns is no
less precarious. So, **[regardless of whether these organizations are
referred to as "citizen slave patrols" or "police/law
enforcement"]{.underline}** (Dulaney, 1996; Reichel, 1999; Roediger,
2010; Skolnick & Fyfe, 1993), **[a societal disdain for African
Americans creates a desensitization to Black suffering and death.
[Second,]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[White Supremacy is maintained when
juries refuse to acknowledge the victimization and humanity of African
Americans]{.underline}**]{.mark} (Feagin, 2014; Fukurai, Butlter, &
Krooth, 1993, Tonry, 2011). Since most juries are made up of Whites,
this greatly increases the likelihood that even when members of law
enforcement are on trial, members of this entity will share many of the
same attitudes about Blacks that police generally have. Stated another
way, chances are **[more likely than not that White jury members will
share the same disdain of African Americans that White members of law
enforcement have, and not convict Whites that have murdered unarmed
Blacks.]{.underline}** Ironically, Black members of law enforcement are
part of the larger White Supremacist system of law enforcement that in
many cases provides these minority members the same rights and
protections as Whites. In other words, **[since Black officers are more
likely to hold negative perceptions of Blacks and to be more inclined to
brutalize Black suspects than White ones]{.underline}** (Dulaney, 1996),
**[it stands to reason that Black officers will rarely be penalized for
murdering unarmed Blacks, as well.]{.underline}**
[**[Third]{.underline}**, **[White Supremacy is maintained when Black
men and women are perceived as inherently dangerous and
sub-human]{.underline}**]{.mark} (Donner, 2014; Karenga, 2010; Walker,
2011**[). A blatant example of the "Black man as dangerous and
sub-human" narrative was offered by Officer Darren Wilson, who when he
was allegedly assaulted by the late Michael Brown publicly proclaimed
that "He looked like a demon."]{.underline}** Interestingly, **[the word
"demon" is reminiscent of the Black "brute" that originally entered
America's consciousness in the D.W. Griffith 1915 film The Birth of a
Nation]{.underline}** (Loewen, 2007). During that era, the Black brute's
sole purpose in life was to rape White women and destroy the White man's
way of life. Similarly, **[the contemporary "demon's" sole purpose in
life is to engage in criminal behavior and actively resist law and order
in society.]{.underline}** Furthermore, **[the word "demon" is not only
a painful and erroneous characterization of Blackness that has remained
stable over time, but is a flagrant societal reminder that Blackness
needs to be stopped, regardless of the cost.]{.underline}** In this
context, **[the Black man is triply dangerous because of his dangerous
mindset, his enormous size, and his race, which is inferior to Whites.
In other words, White Supremacy is sustained when Whites embrace the
belief that Black men are a menace to society and that society needs to
be protected from these men via murder.]{.underline}**
[**[Finally,]{.underline}** **[although it is impossible to put a
monetary value on Black life, the general non- indictment of law
enforcement in the murders of unarmed African Americans provides
resounding evidence that little personal accountability exists for these
murders]{.underline}**]{.mark}. While the heads of law enforcement
agencies generally proclaim these deaths as "unfortunate" or "tragic,"
regrettably, as the officer was indicted in only 13 cases (17% of
fatalities), a very weak connection exists between behavior and
consequences for tragic behavior among members of law enforcement.

#### State-sponsored killing via police brutality cements America's promises to criminalize and maim Blackness as the embodiment of danger.

**[[The death of Michael Brown was not an aberration to American
democracy, but the fulfillment of its promises of order and stability
for the (white) majority]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As historian A.J.
William-Myers notes in Destructive Impulses: An Examination of an
American Secret in Race Relations: White Violence, "[white
violence...was part and parcel of the socioeconomic and political
structure of the American democratic process."11 Pointing to the
"enormous capacity of American democracy to absorb unprecedented level
of violence and not be structurally damaged by it]{.underline},"
Williams-Myers concludes that **[[anti-Black violence and the societal
legitimation of the white agents responsible for the death of Black
people serve to maintain societal order, and bolster the implicit
ideological power of white supremacy in America]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Stated differently, contrary to the democratic calls for justice
currently insisted upon by activists and scholars alike, the deaths of
Black men and boys in America serve to indicate the health of American
democracy not its malaise. For young Black boys, maleness in a white
supremacist society is fraught with difficulty and the all too likely
outcome of death. **[Even as men,]{.underline}** this racialized
masculinity is not thought to result in a recognizable intellectual
maturity, and social standing of a citizen; rather **[the masculinity
impressed upon these Black-male-bodies is known only through its
uncontrollable excess, its lack of maturation, where any and all
transgressions (no matter how small or idiosyncratic) are understood to
be demonstrations of the more primitive and uncivilized aspects of a not
yet evolved savagery.]{.underline}** As Geoffrey Canada, President of
the Harlem Children Zone, remarks, "The image of the male as strong is
mixed with the image of male as violent. Male is virile get confused
with male as promiscuous. Male as adventurous equals male as reckless.
Male as intelligent often gets mixed with male as arrogant, racist, and
sexist ... Boys find themselves pulled and tugged by forces beyond their
control as they make the confusing and sometimes perilous trip to
manhood." The milieu from which Black manhood springs is saturated with
racist caricatures that all seem to legitimate the fear Americans have
of Black men. **[The images and perceptions of Black men as dangerous to
society, women, and themselves ultimately create a pattern of thinking
that works to justify their seemingly inevitable deaths.]{.underline}**
The relationship between anti-Black racism (the hate of Blacks) and
anti-Black chauvinism (the hate of Black males as the barbarous sex) is
not adequately captured by a focus on the manhood denied to Black men
and boys. [Such positions erroneously depict Black men as purely mimetic
creatures incapable of generating identities outside of the decadent
tropes offered by white patriarchy.]{.underline} **[A more correct
analysis of racism and chauvinism would understand that Black male
oppression and death is rooted in an imposition of a deadly masculine
caricature---a barbarism justifying multiple genocidal logics and
encouraging a racist misandry throughout this society and the
disciplines birthed from it.]{.underline}** Ultimately, Black male
suffering is made generic, thought to only be the function of "racism,"
so in an era pushing intellectuals and policy-makers alike to be
antiessentialist (problematizing racial explanations of inequality),
**[Black men are deemed "unfit" for study. [The Black
male]{.mark}]{.underline}** is not born a patriarchal male. He **[[is
raced and sexed peculiarly, configured as barbaric and savage, imagined
to be a violent animal, not a human being.]{.mark} His mere existence
ignites the negrophobia taken to be the agreed upon justification for
his death. [Black male death lessens]{.mark}]{.underline}** their
economic competition with, as well as **[[their political radicality
against, white society]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[It is this
fear]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Black males **[[that allows]{.mark}
society to]{.underline}** **[support the imposition of death on these
bodies, and consent to [the rationalizations the police state offer as
their justifications for killing the Black-male beast (the rapist, the
criminal, and the deviant-thug).]{.mark}]{.underline}** The young Black
male's death, the **[death of Black boys, is merely an extension of this
logic---the need to destroy the Black beast cub before it matures into
full pathology.]{.underline}** The Black boy, that child, is seen **[as
the potential Nigger-beast.]{.underline}** This anti-Black dynamic which
specifically affects the Black boy has been referred to by Elaine Brown
as **[a new kind of racism, a racism built upon the anti-Black mythology
of America's Black males as the super-predator.]{.underline}** This
super-predator mythology not only acts to legitimize the violence
responsible for the deaths of Black males, but inculcates the
rationalization that given what Black males actually are, [**[Black male
death is necessary and an indispensable strategy for the safety and
security of American society]{.underline}**.]{.mark} **[Overlooking the
genocidal disposition of America towards Black males presents an
incomplete diagnosis of the impetus behind the levels of violence and
sanctions imposed upon Black communities (Black women, Black families)
in an effort to control the lives of young Black males.]{.underline}**

#### The trope of criminality is engraved into the flesh of black bodies which makes blackness vulnerable to militarization and fuels the prison industrial complex 

**Harriot '18** (Michael Harriot is a world renowned wypipologist,

Black America,\"

Any attempt at understanding the effects of policing in black America
must begin from a rational, objective perspective. [[We must]{.mark}
first [free ourselves from the]{.mark} accepted biased
[narrative]{.mark} [that accompanies enforcement of]{.mark} the [law in
black communities]{.mark}---namely that the negative effects of the
criminal-justice system are due to the disproportionate criminality of
the black population.]{.underline} Even the most passionate activists
and allies have subconsciously accepted the prevailing premise. They
will preface their arguments on police brutality by acknowledging the
plague of black-on-black crime and violence in the black community.
[They will acknowledge the fact that black people need to "put down the
guns," "stop the violence" and "do better." To be clear, all violence is
bad. We need to address all crime, whether it is the black-on-black
variety or the kind where white teenagers bring in military weapons to
their 10th-grade social studies class.]{.underline} Black people,
however, are just more likely to break the law, necessitating more
police scrutiny and harsher treatment by law enforcement officers. After
all, these officers are just looking at the statistics and doing their
jobs. But is it true? Is the disproportionate state violence against
black people a result of our disproportionate criminality? Do the
inequities in America's criminal-justice system reflect our misconduct?
Are black people policed this way because of racism? Or are police
brutality, mass incarceration and the war on black bodies a necessary
reality? Let's look at the facts. Numerous academic studies have shown
that crime is largely a socioeconomic phenomenon, including this one,
this one and this one by researchers at the University of Minnesota,
which states: Arrests statistics and much research indicate that poor
people are much more likely than wealthier people to commit street
crime. However, some scholars attribute the greater arrests of poor
people to social class bias against them. Despite this possibility,
[[most criminologists would]{.mark} probably [agree that social class
differences in criminal offending are "unmistakable]{.mark}." [The
disparity]{.mark} in crime and arrest rates [is because African
Americans are twice as likely to fall below the poverty index]{.mark}
and [poor whites are less likely to go to prison than even wealthy
blacks]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to a 2016 study by Duke
University and the New School. Poor people commit crimes, and black
communities, on average, tend to be poorer. Yet [[whenever the subject
of police brutality is brought up, people]{.mark} who belong to the
exclusive Greek-letter organization Mu Alpha Gamma Alpha (I'm pretty
sure that's what "MAGA" stands for) will [pull out]{.mark} their
[bibles]{.mark} [and turn to]{.mark} the newest
[testament]{.mark}---]{.underline}the arrest statistics from the FBI's
Uniform Crime Report. They will point out that African Americans were
arrested for more murders than whites. Therefore, they will explain,
black people are more violent. That's why cops lock them up and shoot
them in the face---case closed. But when one takes a look at all of the
data, the numbers tell a different story. [While [white women]{.mark}
might [clutch their purses when they encounter a black man]{.mark} in a
dark parking lot, in comparison with the black population, [whites
commit more than twice the number of rapes, aggravated assaults,
burglaries, larcenies, arsons, frauds, sex offenses, embezzlement,
disorderly conduct and drug abuse violations, according to FBI]{.mark}
numbers.]{.underline} Although it is true that black people, per capita,
commit crime at higher rates, the vast majority of people, black or
white, do not commit a crime in any given year. The per capita crime
rate is a useless factoid when the reality shows that 95 percent of
black people don't commit a crime in any given year. [[Whenever]{.mark}
almost [any kind of crime is committed]{.mark} in the U.S[., it
is]{.mark} far [more likely that the person responsible is
white]{.mark}. In fact, regarding the importance of per capita crime
rates, [B]{.mark}ureau of [J]{.mark}ustice [S]{.mark}tatistics data
[shows]{.mark} that [the rate of violence among]{.mark} poor, urban
[whites]{.mark} (56.4 per 1,000) [is higher than]{.mark} the violence
rate for urban [black]{.mark}]{.underline}[s]{.mark} (51.3 per 1,000).
Let's put it this way: [If a random police officer had to solve a random
crime without any clues and no knowledge of the perpetrator,
statistically, Officer Random would be right far more often if he
guessed that it was a white person]{.underline}. Furthermore, if
Detective Random stopped a white person on the street, the data shows
that that person is statistically as likely to be a criminal as any
black person. [And [yet black people continue to be policed more
violently and scrutinized]{.mark} more often by law enforcement.
[White]{.mark} [America]{.mark} continues to [push the narrative that
black people are violent criminals]{.mark}, even though the numbers
don't show it. But if we are going to examine black criminality, we must
also investigate the opposite side of the narrative: Are black people
actually targeted by law enforcement? Is it true that cops brutalize,
mistreat and kill black people disproportionately? Let's look at the
numbers: Over the past decade, cities and organizations like the
American Civil Liberties Union have compiled extensive reports and data
on traffic stops and pedestrian searches. The statistics are startling:
In San Francisco, [African Americans are 3.3 times]{.mark}, and Latinos
2.6 times, [more likely]{.mark} than whites [to be searched after a
traffic stop]{.mark}. But according to an ACLU report: "San Francisco
[police officers are significantly **less**]{.mark} [likely to find any
evidence of criminality in searches of African Americans or
Latino]{.mark}s." In Greensboro, N.C. (pdf), blacks made up 55 percent
of traffic stops and were more than twice as likely (102 percent) to be
stopped. However, white drivers were 9 percent more likely to have
contraband. Between 2011 and 2015, the Metropolitan Nashville (Tenn.)
Police Department stopped an average of 1,122 per 1,000 black
drivers---more black drivers than were living in the entire county.
Black drivers in Nashville were five times more likely than whites to be
stopped multiple times in a year. Every year, [more than 75 percent of
the people who were stopped and frisked]{.mark} by the New York City
Police Department [were black or Latino]{.mark}. In Philadelphia,
African Americans accounted for 69 percent of stop and frisks from
January to June 2017 in a city in which they are 48 percent of the
population.]{.underline} Almost every city that conducts these kinds of
studies finds the same results. But it is not just traffic and
pedestrian stops that reveal racially biased policing. [The [Hamilton
Project reveals]{.mark} that, even though [blacks and whites use drugs
at about the same rate, blacks are 6.5 times more likely to be
arrested]{.mark} for drug use.]{.underline} And when it comes to police
shootings, the data is incontrovertible. [A study by the American
Journal of Public Health shows that [black men are three times more
likely to die from police shootings]{.mark}. Even [when they are not
violent and have committed no crimes]{.mark}, black people are still
shot and killed by police officers at higher rates than whites. Although
black people make up 13 percent of the population, in 2017, 34 percent
of the people who were shot and killed when they were unarmed and not
attacking were black, Mapping Police Violence reports. To be clear,
[the]{.mark} disproportionate [number of black people shot by police is
not because black people commit]{.mark} more
[crimes]{.mark}]{.underline}. Data from the Washington Post's police
database shows that there is no correlation between crime rates by race
and the disproportionate number of police shootings. As Justin Nix, a
researcher at the University of Louisville, said, according to the
Washington Post, ["[The only thing that was significant in predicting
whether someone shot and killed by police was unarmed was whether or not
they were black." The facts don't support the
narrative]{.mark}.]{.underline} There is no reason to insert
black-on-black crime into any discussion of police violence. There is no
statistical basis for the way African-American communities are
inordinately victimized by law enforcement. Black criminality is a myth.
All this week, The Root will examine policing in black America. We will
delve into the problems, the perspectives and the solutions to the
inequities in how the law is enforced in communities of color across
America. Because as you can see \... They're doing it wrong.

#### Civil society engenders tropes of criminality and savagery of "beastlike" features onto black flesh -- its in the state of vulnerability that black non-being is incapable of finding a place in the white world.

This latest crisis had begun in the 1860s. [[In a moment]{.mark}
equivalent to a historical blink of the eye, [four million people were
transformed from property to human beings to would-be citizens of the
nation]{.mark}. Only a decade before, [few]{.mark} white
[Americans]{.mark} other than abolitionists [had anticipated that black
people would become]{.mark} the [legal equivalents]{.mark} of white
people. In those outrageously heady days of the 1850s [when slavery
debates still raged]{.mark}, colonization schemes were still being
hatched, and white optimism still percolated for black extinction if
emancipation had to come, [the possibility]{.mark} of living among and
abiding [black judges, politicians, and schoolteachers was]{.mark}, for
many, [unimaginable]{.mark}.2]{.underline} By decade's end the
unimaginable had become reality, and the prospect of settlement and
incorporation of African Americans added urgency and confusion to what
many whites already saw as a desperate situation. "Now, far more than at
any time hitherto[, the white people of the United States . . . seem to
be particularly interested to know precisely what manner of man the
negro \[sic\] is," proclaimed [one writer in his 1868
introduction]{.mark} to The Negroes in Negroland; The Negroes in
America; and Negroes Generally, a timely collection of previously
published statements by some of the most respected Europe an travelers
to Africa and American men of renown.]{.underline} "Of these American
writers, those from the North are here more particularly referred to;
and it is trusted that the reader will ponder well the words of such
truly able and representative men as John Adams, Daniel Webster, Horace
Mann, Theodore Parker, Samuel George Morton, William Henry Seward, and
others of scarcely less distinction." In a nutshell, "disinterested" and
authoritative white men the world over, from Europe an colonists and
anthropologists to American presidents and statesmen, had the same
warning to dispatch, according to Hinton Rowan Helper: ["[Negroes" with
their "crime- stained blackness" could not rise to a plane any higher
than that of "base and beastlike savagery]{.mark}."]{.underline} Helper
presented his collection of expert opinions as an archaeologist uses
fossils to reconstruct some prehistoric creature for the world to behold
with gratitude that it no longer walks the earth. [[In Helper's case,
the caption]{.mark} for posterity [read]{.mark}: [terrible things await
a nation bent on handing ballots to beasts]{.mark}. "[Seeing]{.mark},
then, that [the negro]{.mark} does, indeed, [belong to a lower and
inferior order of beings]{.mark}, why in the name of Heaven,
[why]{.mark}," [he pleaded with his readers]{.mark}, "[should we forever
degrade and disgrace both ourselves and our posterity by
entering]{.mark}, of our own volition, [into more intimate relations
with him]{.mark}?]{.underline} May God, in his restraining mercy, forbid
that we should ever do this most foul and wicked thing!"3 Helper's
warning failed. Reconstruction proceeded, but not before the seeds of
dread, planted by Helper and many other post- emancipation writers,
spread across the nation like crabgrass in June. When Shaler began
writing about the Negro Problem after federal troops had withdrawn from
the South, after ex-Confederates had returned to power, and after the
nation had set itself on a path of reconciliation, those seeds continued
to produce apprehension about a future fraught with peril. "The forecast
of the unprejudiced observer was exceedingly unfavorable. Every
experiment of freeing blacks on this continent," Shaler wrote with
seeming exasperation, "has in the end resulted in even worse conditions
than slavery brought to them." Haiti and Jamaica were perfect
demonstrations of how blacks' "defects" could wreak havoc on
civilization. Haitians had once belonged to a colonial society of great
"fertile lands" and "great industries of sugar and coffee culture" built
on "mild slavery." But with a corrupt government and a failed economy,
["[the black race \[had\] fallen through its freedom to a state that is
but savagery with a little veneer of Europe and customs]{.mark}." These
were "a people without a single trace of promise except that of
extinction through the diseases of sloth and vice."]{.underline} Jamaica
was just as bad. It had once been a "garden land of the tropics," the
"British of the South," but had now become a land of "barbarism."4
America must take heed, Shaler continued. [[Friends of the race]{.mark}
who had not simply fought for blacks' freedom but also demanded their
"complete enfranchisement as American citizens," who by blind faith and
by declaration tried to "fi t them for a place in the structure of a
self- controlling society," [did not realize that "resolutions cannot
help this rooted nature of man."]{.mark} "[The real dangers that this
African blood brings to our state," Shaler cautioned, lay in "the
peculiarities of nature which belong to the negroes as a race." Unlike
in "our own race]{.mark} inheritance," [black brains stopped developing
sooner, leaving "the negroes" with an animal nature unaltered by the
"fruits of civilization]{.mark}." The results were devastating[: blacks
were incapable of controlling their sexual impulses]{.mark}; [they were
unable to work together f]{.mark}or a common purpose; [and]{.mark}, most
importantly, they had no power to delay gratification and plan for the
future.]{.underline} Despite their "charming nature," their "quick
sensibilities," and their "present Americanized shape," these
"peculiarities" were easily overlooked by those who did not "know the
negro by long and large experience," and who falsely believed that they
were like them. With patience and "the opportunity to search closely
into the nature of this race, they will perceive that the inner man is
really as singular, as different in motives from themselves, as his
outward appearance indicates[." "There can be no doubt," Shaler
proclaimed, "that for centuries to come [the task of weaving these
African threads of life into our society will be]{.mark} [the
greatest]{.mark} of all-American [problem]{.mark}s."5]{.underline}

The body of literature concerning viewers\' interpretations and
responses to news and entertainment programming featuring black men as
criminal suspects illustrates that what viewers \"bring to the screen\"
in terms of their existing attitudes and beliefs plays a profound role
in the media-viewer relationship. With this relationship in mind, the
last section of this paper pertains specifically to viewers\' memory of
crime information. In particular, [in this section I overview research
that I have con- ducted concerning [how]{.mark} biases in the ways in
which [viewers\' mistaken identification of African American men as
criminal suspects]{.mark} featured in news stories not only
[reflects]{.mark} existing [stereotypes of black men as \"dangerous and
criminal,\" but also]{.mark} likely [serves to reinforce
stereotyping]{.mark} in ways that can implicate essentially any black
man as potentially threatening or violent (Oliver, 1999; Oliver &
Fonash, 2002).]{.underline} [Memory and Social Cognition As with
research concerning interpretations and enjoyment, re- search on memory
generally suggests that people tend to recall information about
situations or individuals that is consistent with existing attitudes or
beliefs (Fyock & Stangor, 1994). In this regard, [if individuals]{.mark}
[harbor stereotypes of black men as criminal, biases in memory]{.mark}
should [result in greater recall of black than white criminals]{.mark}
featured in newscasts, and may even result in mistaken memories of
having seen a black suspect portrayed when either no racially
identifying information was provided or when the suspect was actually
white (Drabman, Robertson, Patterson, Jarvie, Hammer, & Cordua, 1981).
Furthermore, [this]{.mark} type of [mistaken recall should be]{.mark}
particularly [likely]{.mark} to occur [when the]{.mark} type of
[crime]{.mark} portrayed [is consistent with stereotypes associated with
African American men]{.mark} (i.e., the crime is violent rather than
nonviolent.]{.underline}) In addition to predicting biases in recall per
se, research on recognition memory also suggests that when trying to
identify who has been seen in a news portrayal from a \"line-up\" of
potential suspects, systematic errors that vary by race may be expected
to occur. In particular, research on social cognition suggests that
people tend to categorize individuals according to a variety of
demographic traits - race included - and tend to perceive that
individuals who are categorized into the same group are particularly
similar or homogenous (Fiske, 1995; Macrae & Bodenhausen, 2000; Taylor &
Falcone, 1982). [Furthermore, if a target\'s category is different from
the perceiver\'s category, [if a white person perceives a black
person]{.mark}, for example, [then perceived]{.mark} [similarity]{.mark}
of the target members [is]{.mark} particularly [heightened]{.mark}. What
does this line of reasoning imply in terms of whites\' memories of news?
[This]{.mark} reasoning [suggests that when white viewers see a newscast
featuring an African American man as a criminal]{.mark} suspect, [not
only are they likely to remember seeing an African American man, but
they are]{.mark} also [likely to confuse the]{.mark} specific
[individual who was pictured with any]{.mark} individual in the same
racial category (i.e. *any* [black man]{.mark}).]{.underline} The
discussion thus far of [news recall has assumed that perceivers\'
mistaken recall and identification memory will mirror existing
stereotypes associating black men with danger or
criminality.]{.underline} On the one hand, given the prevalence and
persistence of this stereotype, this is likely a safe assumption to
make. Nevertheless, there are clearly variations in the extent to which
individuals endorse such stereotypes. Given this variation, should one
assume that only viewers with high levels of racism are likely to
evidence racially-based patterns in their memories of news? In some
regards, the answer to this question appears to be \"yes.\" After all,
if a person does not harbor racist attitudes, then it would seem
unlikely that their memories would reflect stereo- types of black men as
criminal. On the other hand, a growing and substantial body of research
suggests that stereotypes can influence cognitions and behaviors in ways
that are largely outside of individuals\' cognitive awareness (Bargh,
1999; Devine, 1989; Devine & Monteith, 1999; Fazio, Jackson, Dunton, &
Williams, 1995). [In general, this research on \"implicit stereotyping\"
suggests that [most every-]{.mark} [one is]{.mark} at least [aware of
racial stereotypes, and]{.mark} therefore when a member of a stigmatized
group is encountered, [these stereo- types are \"primed\"
regardless]{.mark} [of the extent to which the stereotypes are
endorsed.]{.mark}]{.underline} While individuals who are \"low\" on
measures of racial prejudice may generally be likely to disregard or
inhibit primed stereotypical cognitions, these same individuals to mind,
nor may they always have the cognitive resources avail- may not always
be aware when stereotypes have been brought able to engage in stereotype
inhibition. Consequently, primed stereotypes (or implicit stereotypes)
have the potential to influence the behaviors and perceptions of all
individuals, regardless of their stated or endorsed racial attitudes. To
examine what research in social cognition and implicit stereotyping
imply about memory of criminal suspects, [we]{.underline} (Oliver &
Fonash, 2002) [conducted an experiment in which white viewers first
completed a questionnaire that included the anti-black attitude scale
(Katz & Hass, 1988) as a means of assessing racist attitudes.
Approximately two weeks later, these same individuals examined a series
of brief newspaper stories that included two news sections pertaining to
crime. These two sections featured a total of two stories featuring
violent crimes (murder and rape), and two stories featuring nonviolent
crimes (embezzlement and mail fraud). Among these four stories, two
featured a photograph of a black male criminal suspect, and two featured
a photograph of a white male criminal suspect. [Although the orders of
the stories and the pairing of the photographs and the stories were
varied, all participants in the study saw a black male paired with a
violent crime and a nonviolent crime]{.mark}, and a white male paired
with a violent crime and a nonviolent crime. After viewing the news
stories, participants were asked to complete a series of questionnaires
pertaining to their perceptions of the stories, with many of these
questions designed only to detract their attention from the true purpose
of the study. Subsequently, participants were then presented with a
series of photographs of individuals, and were asked to indicate the
likelihood that each individual was the one featured in each of the
crime stories examined using scales ranging from 1 (Definitely Not
Pictured in the News Story) to 7 ( Definitely Was Pictured in the News
Story). Among the photographs included in this task, three photographs
were of African American men who had not been included in the stories,
and three were of white men who had not been included in the stories.
Hence, the \"correct\" answer for these photographs was \"1\"
(Definitely Not Pictured), with higher scores indicating greater
misidentification. As predicted, [the results revealed that participants
were more likely to misidentify black men as the suspect]{.mark} when
the actual story contained a photograph of a black man ( M = 3.22, SD =
0.82) than a white man ( M = 2.50, SD = 1 .03), t( 59) = 6.14, p \<
.001.]{.underline} On the other hand, similar patterns were revealed for
misidentification of white men, with participants more likely to
misidentify white men when the actual story contained a photograph of a
white man ( M = 3.10, SD = 0.97) than a black man (M = 2.51, SD = 1
.01), t(59) = 4.00, p \< .001. While these findings may appear to
suggest that viewers\' mistaken identification of suspects is equitable
in terms of racial imagery, it is important to keep in mind that in this
study, blacks and whites were represented as criminals in equal
proportions, with care being taken to hold all other variables constant
(e.g., the manner in which the suspect was portrayed). [In contrast, the
aforementioned con- tent analytic studies of actual crime portrayals
demonstrate that [African American men are over-represented as criminals
in the news and are portrayed in ways that make them appear]{.mark}
particularly [dangerous and guilty.]{.mark} Hence, our findings that
black suspects in the news resulted in greater misidentification of
black men as suspects (regardless of white misidentification) suggest
that the disparity of misidentification between black and white men
outside of controlled laboratory conditions employed here may be
particularly pronounced. In addition to this finding, this study also
found evidence that black men were especially likely to be misidentified
with violent rather than nonviolent crime (see Figure 1).]{.underline}
Specifically, our analysis revealed an interaction between the race of
the person in the identification task and the type of crime being
recalled, F (1,58) = 15.76, eta2 = .21, p \< .001. That is, this study
found than when the story was about a violent crime, black men were
particularly likely to be misidentified as the individual who was
pictured. In contrast, white men were somewhat more likely to be
misidentified with nonviolent than violent stories, though this
difference did not reach statistical significance.

[Many of the **[massive demonstrations]{.mark}** and modes of resistance
we have seen in the last months not only **[produce a space of
appearance]{.mark}**; they seize upon an already established space
permeated by existing power, seeking to sever the relations between the
public space, the public square, and the existing regime]{.underline}.
So [the limits of the political are exposed and the link between the
theater of legitimacy and public space is severed]{.underline}; that
theater is no longer unproblematically housed in public space, since
public space now occurs in the midst of another action, one that
displaces the power that claims legitimacy precisely by taking over the
field of its effects. Simply put, **[[the bodies on the street redeploy
the space of appearance in order to contest and negate the existing
forms of political legitimacy]{.underline}]{.mark}**- and just as they
sometimes fill or take over public space, the material history of those
structures also works on them, becoming part of their very action,
remaking a history in the midst of its most concrete and sedimented
artifices. [**[These are subjugated and empowered actors who seek to
wrest legitimacy from an existing state apparatus]{.mark}** that depends
upon the regulation of the public space of appearance for its theatrical
self-constitution]{.underline}. In wresting that power, [a new space is
created, a new "between" of bodie]{.underline}s, as it were, [that lays
claim to existing space through the action of a new
alliance]{.underline}, and those bodies are seized and animated by those
existing spaces in the very acts by which they reclaim and resignify
their meanings. [**[Such a struggle intervenes in the spatial
organization of power, which includes]{.mark}** the allocation and
**[restriction of spatial locations in which]{.mark}** and by which
**[any population may appear]{.mark}**, which implies a spatial
regulation of when and how the "popular will" may appear]{.underline}.
This view of the spatial restriction and allocation of who may
appear---in effect, of who may become a subject of appearance---suggests
an operation of power that works through both foreclosure and
differential allocation.

###  DA - Politics of Innocence 

#### Civil society functions as a politics of innocence, rendering revolutionary and insurgent politics unimaginable. Innocence becomes a necessary precondition for the launching of mass antiracist political campaigns as blackness itself is considered synonymous with guilt. Black social death is achieved via coded discourses of "criminality." There is no innocence to blackness, a protest to the norm is revolutionary.

While I was reading the local newspaper, I came across a story that
caught my attention. [The article was about a seventeen-year-old boy
from Baltimore named [Isaiah Simmons]{.mark} who [died in a juvenile
facility]{.mark} in 2007, when five to [seven counselors suffocated him
while restraining him]{.mark} for hours. When Simmons was unresponsive,
[the counselors dumped his body in the snow and did not call for medical
assistance]{.mark} for more than forty minutes. [In]{.mark} late March
[2012]{.mark}, the [case was thrown out]{.mark}. [None of the
counselors]{.mark} involved in his murder [were charged]{.mark}. [An
article I found online about the case was titled "Charges
Dropped]{.mark} Against 5 [In]{.mark} Juvenile [Offender's
Death]{.mark}."² By [emphasizing]{.mark} [that it was a juvenile
offender who died]{.mark}, the [article]{.mark} immediately [flags
Simmons as a criminal]{.mark}, [signaling]{.mark} to readers [that his
death is]{.mark} inconsequential and thus [not worthy of
sympathy]{.mark}.]{.underline} Every comment posted on the article was
crude and contemptuous. [[The]{.mark} general [sentiment was that his
death was]{.mark} no big [loss to society]{.mark}.]{.underline} The news
about the case being thrown out barely registered at all.³[[There was
no]{.mark} public [outcry]{.mark}, no call to [action]{.mark}, no
[discussion]{.mark} of the myriad issues bound up with Simmons's death:
youth incarceration, racism, the privatization of prisons and jails (he
died at a private facility), medical neglect, state violence, and so
forth.]{.underline} For weeks after reading the article, I contemplated
these questions: What is the difference between Trayvon Martin and
Isaiah Simmons? Which cases galvanize activists into action, and which
are ignored? In the wake of the Jena Six, Troy Davis, Oscar Grant,
Trayvon Martin, and other high-profile cases,⁴ [I have taken note of the
patterns that structure political appeals, particularly the way
[innocence becomes a necessary]{.mark} [precondition for the launching
of mass antiracist political campaigns]{.mark}.]{.underline} These
campaigns often focus on prosecuting and harshly punishing the
individuals responsible for overt and locatable acts of racist violence,
thus positioning the state and the criminal justice system as allies and
protectors of the oppressed. [[When the "innocence" of a black victim is
not established, he or she will not become a suitable spokesperson for
the cause]{.mark}.⁵ An empathetic structure of feeling based on appeals
to innocence has come to ground contemporary antiracist politics.
[Within this framework,]{.mark} [empathy can be established]{.mark} only
[when a person meets]{.mark} the standards of [authentic victimhood and
moral purity,]{.mark} [which requires black people]{.mark}, in the words
of Frank Wilderson, [to be cleansed]{.mark} of
"niggerization."]{.underline} [Social, political, cultural, and legal
recognition happens only when a person is thoroughly whitewashed,
neutralized, [and made unthreatening]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
"spokesperson" activist model, which involves the isolation of cases
considered "exemplary," also tends to emphasize the individual rather
than the collective nature of racist injuries. [Framing oppression in
terms of individual actors is a liberal tactic that dismantles
collective responses to oppression and diverts attention from structural
violence. [Using "innocence" as the foundation to address antiblack
violence is an appeal to the white imaginary]{.mark},]{.underline}
though these arguments are certainly made by people of color as well.
[Re[lying on this framework re-entrenches a logic that criminalizes race
and constructs docile subjects.]{.mark}]{.underline} [A liberal politics
of recognition can only reproduce a guilt-innocence schematization that
fails to grapple with the fact that [there is an a priori association of
blackness with guilt]{.mark} (criminality).]{.underline} Perhaps
association is too generous---there is a flat-out conflation of the
terms. As Wilderson notes in "Gramsci's Black Marx: Whither the Slave in
Civil Society?" [[the cop's answer to the black subject's question---why
did you shoot me?---follows a tautology: "I shot you because you are
Black; you are Black because I shot you.]{.mark}"⁶]{.underline} In the
words of Frantz Fanon, the cause is the consequence.⁷ [Not only are
[black men assumed guilty until proven innocent]{.mark},
[blackness]{.mark} itself [is considered synonymous with
guilt]{.mark}.⁸]{.underline} Authentic victimhood, passivity, moral
purity, and the adoption of a whitewashed position are necessary for
recognition in the eyes of the state. Wilderson, quoting N.W.A., notes
that "a nigga on the warpath" cannot be a proper subject of empathy. [⁹
The [desire for recognition compels political subjects to seek alliance
with the state and to sacrifice themselves in order to meet]{.mark} the
standards of [victimhood]{.mark}. This is also the logic of rape-revenge
narratives: only after a woman is thoroughly degraded can audiences
begin to tolerate her rage]{.underline} (outside of films and books,
violent women are not tolerated even when they have the "moral" grounds
to fight back, as exemplified by the high rates of women who are
imprisoned or sentenced to death for murdering or assaulting abusive
partners). [Although it is sometimes necessary to make "innocence"
appeals for strategic reasons---to win a case or to influence public
opinion---these strategies become problematic when they reinforce a
framework that renders revolutionary and insurgent politics
unimaginable.]{.underline} The prison abolitionist Ruth Wilson Gilmore
notes that "while saving anyone is a good thing to do, to try to assert
innocence as a key political organizing strategy is to turn a blind eye
to the system and how it works."¹⁰ For Gilmore, the problem "is not to
figure out how to determine or prove the innocence of certain
individuals or certain classes of people, but to attack the general
system through which criminalizationproceeds."¹¹These appeals to
innocence are also anachronistic because they do not address the
transformation and reorganization of racist strategies in the
post--civil rights era. [A [politics of innocence is only capable of
acknowledging examples of direct]{.mark}, individualized [acts of racist
violence while obscuring]{.mark} the racism of a putatively color-blind
liberalism that operates on a [structural level]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Posing the issue in terms of personal prejudice feeds the fallacy of
racism as an individual intention, feeling, or personal prejudice,
though there is certainly a psychological and affective dimension of
racism that exceeds the individual in that it is shaped by social norms
and media representations. The liberal color-blind paradigm of racism
submerges race beneath the "commonsense" logic of crime and
punishment.¹² This effectively conceals racism because it is not
considered racist to be against crime. [Such cases as the execution of
Troy Davis---in which the courts come under scrutiny for racial
bias---also legitimize state violence by treating such cases as
exceptional. The political response to the murder of Troy Davis does not
challenge the assumption that communities need to clean up their streets
by rounding up criminals, for it relies on the claim that Davis is not
one of those feared criminals, but an innocent black man.
[Innocence]{.mark}, however, [is often code for nonthreatening to white
civil society]{.mark}. Troy Davis is differentiated from other black
men---the bad ones---and the legal system is diagnosed as being infected
with racism, masking the fact that the legal system is the constituent
mechanism through which racial violence is carried out (wishful
last-minute appeals to the right to a fair trial reveal this, for they
assume that trials are intended to be fair).]{.underline} The state is
imagined to be deviating from its intended role as protector of the
people rather than being the primary perpetrator. H. Rap Brown provides
a sobering reminder that "Justice means 'just-uswhite-folks.' There is
no redress of grievance for Blacks in this country."¹³ [While there are
countless examples of overt racism, [black social]{.mark} (and physical)
[death is primarily achieved via coded discourses of "criminality" and
mediated forms of state violence carried out by an impersonal carceral
apparatu]{.mark}s (a matrix of police, prisons, the legal system,
prosecutors, parole boards, prison guards, probation officers, and so
forth).]{.underline} In other words, incidents where a biased individual
attacks or discriminates against a person of color can be identified as
racism to "conscientious persons," but the racism underlying the
systematic imprisonment of black Americans under the pretense of the War
on Drugs is more difficult to locate and generally remains invisible
because it is spatially confined. When it is visible, it fails to arouse
public sympathy, even among the black leadership. As Loïc Wacquant, a
scholar of the carceral state, asks, "What is the chance that white
Americans will identify with Black convicts when even the Black
leadership has turned its back on them?"¹⁴ The abandonment of black
convicts by civil rights organizations is reflected in the history of
these organizations. From 1975 to 1986, the NAACP and the Urban League
identified imprisonment as a central issue, and the disproportionate
incarceration of black Americans was understood as a problem that was
structural and political. Spokespersons from the civil rights
organizations related imprisonment to the general confinement of black
Americans. Imprisoned black men were, as Wacquant notes, portrayed
inclusively as "brothers, uncles, neighbors, friends."¹⁵ Between 1986
and 1990 there was a dramatic shift in the rhetoric and official policy
of the NAACP and the Urban League that exemplifies the turn to a
politics of innocence. By the early 1990s, the NAACP had dissolved its
prison program and ceased publication of articles about rehabilitation
and post-imprisonment issues. Meanwhile, these organizations began to
embrace the rhetoric of individual responsibility and a tough-on-crime
stance that encouraged blacks to collaborate with police to get drugs
out of their neighborhoods, even going as far as endorsing harsher
sentences for minors and recidivists. Black convicts, initially a part
of the "we" articulated by civil rights groups, became them. Wacquant
writes, "This \[hesitation to advocate for Black convicts\] is further
reinforced by the fact, noted long ago by W. E. B. Du Bois, that the
tenuous position of the black bourgeoisie in the socioracial hierarchy
rests critically on its ability to distance itself from its unruly
lower-class brethren: to offset the symbolic disability of blackness,
middle-class African Americans must forcefully communicate to whites
that they have 'absolutely no sympathy and no known connections with any
black man who has committed a crime.'"¹⁶ When the black leadership and
middle-class blacks differentiate themselves from poorer blacks, they
feed into a notion of black exceptionalism that is used to dismantle
antiracist struggles. This class of exceptional blacks (Barack Obama,
Condoleeza Rice, Colin Powell) supports the image of America as a
post-racial society. The root of this shift in the rhetoric and policy
of civil rights organizations is perhaps a fear of affirming the
conflation of blackness and criminality. However, by not advocating for
prisoners, they shore up and extend the penal state by individualizing,
depoliticizing, and decontextualizing the issue of "crime and
punishment" and vilifying those most likely to be subjected to
racialized state violence. [This [disidentification]{.mark} with poor,
urban black Americans is not limited to black men, but [also affects
black women, who are vilified via the figure of the Welfare
Queen]{.mark}, [portrayed as a lazy, sexually irresponsible burden on
society (]{.mark}particularly hardworking white Americans).]{.underline}
The welfare state and the penal state complement each other, as revealed
by Bill Clinton's 1998 statements denouncing prisoners and ex-prisoners
who receive welfare or Social Security: he condemns former prisoners who
receive welfare assistance, accusing them of deviously committing "fraud
and abuse" against "working families" who "play by the rules."¹⁷
Furthermore, this complementarity is gendered. Black women are the shock
absorbers of the social crisis created by the penal state[: the
[incarceration of black men]{.mark} profoundly [increases the burden put
on black women]{.mark}, who are forced to perform more waged and unwaged
(caring) labor, raise children alone, and who are punished by the state
when their husbands or family members are convicted of crimes (for
example, [a family cannot receive housing assistance if someone in the
household has been convicted of a drug felony]{.mark}).]{.underline} The
reconfiguration of the welfare state under the Clinton administration
(which imposed stricter regulations on welfare recipients) further
intensified the backlash against poor black women. In this view, the
welfare state is the apparatus used to regulate poor black women who are
not subjected to regulation by the penal state that is directed chiefly
at black men---though it is important to note [that the feminization of
poverty and the punitive turn in nonviolent crime policy led to a 400
percent increase in the female prison population]{.underline} between
1980 and the late 1990s.¹⁸Racialized patterns of incarceration and the
assault on the urban poor are not seen as a form of racist state
violence because, in the eyes of the public, convicts (along with their
families and associates) deserve such treatment. [The politics of
innocence directly fosters this culture of vilification, even when it is
used by civil rights organizations.]{.underline}

#### Blackness is a preconceived notion of danger; whiteness sees violence rather than resistance and fails to see that its rather the system built in opposition to black bodies. The 1AC is an embodiment of the negation of a politics of innocence which departs from enabling white civil society to purify and morally ennoble itself.

[The [insistence on innocence results in a refusal to hear those labeled
guilty]{.mark} or defined by the state [as "criminals."]{.mark} [When we
rely on appeals to innocence]{.mark}, [we foreclose a form of resistance
that is outside the limits of law and instead ally ourselves with the
state]{.mark}. This ignores that the "enemies" in the War on Drugs and
the War on Terror are racially defined, and that gender and class
delimit who is worthy of legal recognition. [When the Occupy movement
was in full swing]{.mark}, I read countless articles and encountered
participants who were eager to police the politics and tactics of those
who did not fit into a nonviolent model of resistance.]{.underline} The
tendency was to construct a politics from the position of the
disenfranchised white middle-class and to remove, deny, and
differentiate the Occupy movement from the "delinquent" or radical
elements by condemning property destruction, confrontations with cops,
and---in cases like Baltimore--- anticapitalist and anarchist analyses.
[When [Amy Goodman asked Maria Lewis from Occupy Oakland about the
"violent" protestors]{.mark} after more than four hundred arrests made
during an attempt to occupy the vacant Henry J. Kaiser Convention Center
in Oakland, I was pleased that Lewis affirmed rather than excised
people's anger]{.underline}: AMY GOODMAN: Maria Lewis, what about some
of the reports that said that the protesters were violent? MARIA LEWIS[:
Absolutely[. There was a lot of anger this weekend]{.mark}, and I think
that the anger the protesters showed in the streets this weekend and the
fighting back that did take place was reflective of a larger anger in
Oakland that is boiling over at the betrayal of the system. I think that
[people]{.mark}, day by day, [are realizing]{.mark}, [as the economy
gets worse and worse]{.mark}, as [unemployment gets worse]{.mark} and
worse, as [homelessness gets worse]{.mark} and worse, that the economic
system, that capitalism in Oakland, is failing us]{.underline}. And
people are really angry about that, and they're beginning to fight back.
And I think that's a really inspiring thing.⁵⁷ Although the comment
still frames the issue in terms of capitalist crisis, the response
skillfully rearticulates the terms of the discussion by [a) [affirming
the actions immediately]{.mark}, b) [refusing to purify the
movement]{.mark} by integrating rather than excluding the "violent"⁵⁸
elements, c) [legitimizing the anger and desires]{.mark} of the
protestors, and d) [shifting the attention to the structural nature of
the problem rather than making moral judgments about individual
actors]{.mark}.]{.underline} In other words, [it rejects a politics of
innocence that reproduces the "good," compliant citizen.]{.underline}
Stokely Carmichael put it well when he said, ["The way the oppressor
tries to stop the oppressed from using violence as a means to attain
liberation is to raise ethical or moral questions about violence. I want
to state emphatically here that violence in any society is neither moral
nor is it ethical. It is neither right, nor is it wrong. It is just
simply a question of who has the power to legalize
violence."⁵⁹]{.underline} The practice of isolating morally agreeable
cases in order to highlight racist violence requires passively suffered
black death and panders to a framework that strengthens and conceals
current paradigms of racism. Although it may be factually true to state
that Trayvon Martin was unarmed, we should not state this with a
righteous sense of satisfaction. What if Martin were armed? What if he
was able to defend himself? Had the situation resulted in the death of
George Zimmerman rather than of Martin, it is unlikely that the public
would have been as outraged and galvanized into action to the same
extent. Prior to Zimmerman's acquittal, many people on the left had
faith that there would be "justice for Trayvon," as though prison time
for Zimmerman could somehow compensate for Martin's death. When we build
politics around standards of legitimate victimhood that require passive
sacrifice, we will build a politics that requires a dead black boy to
make its point. It's not surprising that the nation or even the black
leadership have failed to rally behind CeCe McDonald, [a [black trans
woman]{.mark} who [was convicted of second-degree manslaughter after a
group of racist, transphobic white people attacked her]{.mark} and her
friends, cutting McDonald's [cheek with a glass bottle]{.mark} and
provoking an altercation that [led to the death of a white man who had a
swastika tattoo]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Trans women of color]{.mark} who
are involved in confrontations that result in the death of their
attackers [are criminalized for their survival.]{.mark} When [Akira
Jackson]{.mark}, a black trans woman, [stabbed and killed her boyfriend
after he beat her]{.mark} with a baseball bat, she [was given a
four-year sentence]{.mark} for manslaughter. [Cases that involve an
"innocent" (passive), victimized black person also provide an
opportunity for the liberal white conscience to purify and morally
ennoble itself by taking a position against racism]{.mark}. [We need to
challenge the use of certain raced and gendered subjects as instruments
of emotional relief for white civil society]{.mark}, or as bodies that
can be displaced for the sake of providing analogies to amplify white
suffering ("slavery" being the favored analogy).]{.underline} Although
we must emphasize that Troy Davis did not kill police officer Mark
MacPhail, [maybe we also should question [why the public is morally
outraged by the killing of a cop and not the 136 unarmed black Americans
murdered by police officers, security guards, and self-appointed
vigilantes in 2012]{.mark} alone]{.underline}. Talking about these
murders will not undo them. Having the "right line" cannot alter reality
if we do not put our bodies where our mouths are. As Spivak says, "it
can't become our goal to keep watching our language."⁶⁰[[Rejecting the
politics of innocence is not about assuming a certain theoretical
posture or adopting a certain perspective---it is a lived
position]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#  AFRICOM -- Extra Cards 

##  AFRICOM Brief

- The Africa Program assesses how the United States can best utilize the
  U.S. Africa Command in combination with civilian agencies to address
  security challenges in Africa. The CSIS Africa and International
  Security Programs have closely tracked the establishment and
  development of the U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) since 2007 by
  engaging in dialogue with U.S. policymakers, AFRICOM officials, and
  African leaders.

- The territory of the command consists of all of the African continent
  except for Egypt

- The US arms outposts in Africa to maintain its security interests:

  - Neutralize al-Shabaab and transition the security responsibilities
    of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) to the Federal
    Government of Somalia (FGS)

  - Degrade violent extremist organizations in the Sahel Maghreb and
    contain instability in Libya

  - Contain and degrade Boko Haram

  - Interdict illicit activity in the Gulf of Guinea and Central Africa
    with willing and capable African partners

  - Build peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance and disaster response
    capacity of African partners

- US arms presence is used to essentially police the region

[**A brief background of the US military** is necessary to better
understand why and how Africom came into being. The military cartography
of Africa prior to Africom was informed by Washington's **Cold War lens
of geopolitics**.]{.underline} [U.S. defense operations for Africa were
overseen by]{.underline} three different commands: [the **European
Command**]{.underline} (EUCOM) [based]{.underline} [in]{.underline}
Stuttgart, [Germany]{.underline}, which covered West, Central, and
Southern Africa; **[Central Command]{.underline}** (CENTCOM) [located
in]{.underline} Tampa, [Florida]{.underline}-USA whose main field of
coverage is the Middle East but also the Horn of Africa; [and the
**Pacific Command**]{.underline} **(**PACOM) [located in Honolulu,
Hawaii-USA]{.underline} which covered the islands of the western coast
of Africa.1 The birth place of humanity was a low priority for America
during the Cold War despite the numerous proxy wars it tacitly or
directly supported. [The Cold War ended in 1989 and the logic and
rationales governing it became obsolete]{.underline}. Africa had
progressively entered the radar screen of the US as "a continent
emerging in importance, 22 percent of the earth's surface, ...
approaching 800 million inhabitants, growing in political clout... rich
in human capital and natural resources."2 Amer[ica's policy planners
wanted to reconstruct African military cartography to align with
America's post-Cold War geopolitical interests.]{.underline} **[Africa
was now seen as a unique "region" and a new command was to represent "a
realignment of our organizational construct on how we deal with
Africa]{.underline}**. [And so instead of having three
commanders]{.underline} that deal with Africa as a third or a fourth
priority, **[we will have a single]{.underline}
[commander]{.underline}** that deals with it, day in day out, as his
first and only priority."3 [Africom was officially
announced]{.underline} by former President George W. Bush [on February
6, **2007**]{.underline}. According to its genitor, [Africom is a
unified command that aims to **bring together all the security programs
the United States supports on the continent**.]{.underline} The Pentagon
expected the new command to be headquartered inside the continent and
fully operational by the fall of 2008. However, [under a cloud of
**heavy international criticism** and African skepticism, the US
military failed to find a country on the continent willing to host its
new pet project.]{.underline} Liberia offered to host the new command
but did not match the Pentagon's strategic requirements. [Africom is
"temporarily" based in Stuttgart-Germany]{.underline}. It is worth
noting that [Egypt]{.underline}, which is geographically part of the
African continent, [will remain associated with America's Central
Command. This is due to Egypt's strategic importance to US foreign
policy in the Middle East. **Egypt's exclusion**]{.underline} from
Africom [is proof that Africom's primary goals are
military]{.underline}, geopolitical, and economic; [not diplomatic or
humanitarian]{.underline} as the official rhetoric insists. **[Africom's
stated mission is to support humanitarian assistance, civic action,
professional development of militaries, assistance in border/maritime
security, and natural disaster response]{.underline}**. This support is
bilateral, sub-regional (ECOWAS for example) and multilateral via the
African Union. Such a broad and bold plan of engagement aroused
suspicions among African governments. These suspicions were reinforced
by America's negative global image under former President George W Bush.
The US Military held several informational sessions around the African
continent to explain the goals and philosophy of Africom in hopes of
finding a host country for the command. Official and unofficial contacts
were made with African leaders. [Nigeria, South Africa and Libya, were
among Africom's most outspoken critics and ostensibly stood against the
project.]{.underline} Skeptics of Africom cite previous US military
forays in Africa which led to a disproportionate development of military
institutions relative to instruments of civilian rule. Others see
Africom as a naked attempt to exert American control over Africa's
valuable natural resources.4 Many Africans simply believe Africom will
hurt Africa5 . There is widespread suspicion (and rightfully so) that
America's policy is primarily driven by a need for resources. [The high
profile US interventions in the Horn of Africa, Middle East, and
Asia---which are perceived as resource grabs---have left Africans
wary.]{.underline} Furthermore, Africa already contains many volatile
regions where militarization could worsen instability and/or undermine
peace-building efforts. For America, Africom represents militarization
for benign purposes. But how far back does American militarization span
on the continent? What are the results of previous military adventures
in Africa? And how has American militarization impacted local cultures
of violence?

ASIA", http://www.faoa.org/Resources/Documents/GAUDILLIERE.pdf, DMW)

Africa, The "Great Forgotten One" Of The Pivot\... To Asia First, [[the
administration has quickly reacted with a **rhetorical move** in order
to diminish the negative connotation inherent to the **word pivot**. The
euphemistic]{.underline}]{.mark} use of rebalance, or [[refocus to Asia
tries to counter the **impression** that the U.S. is pivoting away from
other places.]{.underline}]{.mark} Nonetheless, [[this effort cannot
hide the **downgrading** of Africa contained in official expressions of
U.S. grand strategy since 2011.]{.underline}]{.mark} For instance, [[the
D]{.underline}]{.mark}efense [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}trategic [[G]{.underline}]{.mark}uidance [[of
2011 uses the word "**Africa**" only
once]{.underline}]{.mark} throughout its sixteen pages,30 compared to
twenty-four appearances in the 2010 National Security
Strategy.31 Moreover, symbolically enough, [[Africa is addressed as the
last item on the White House Foreign Policy
webpage]{.underline}]{.mark}.32 The 2012 Presidential Policy Directive
on U.S. strategy toward sub-Saharan Africa partly fills this rhetorical
gap, but its implementation remains hinged on the same structural
contradictions. In fact, the translation of [[U.S. strategic motives
into operational objectives leads to selective engagement, as opposed to
a **holistic strategy** that addresses challenges on
the]{.underline} ]{.mark}whole [[African]{.mark}
[continent]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this vein, the 2013 presidential
trip to Africa epitomizes two things. First, it underscores the position
of Africa on the American agenda. It is the only appearance of Barak
Obama on this continent since 2009, a relative "absence" with political
implications: "when we talk about U.S.-Africa policy \[\...\] we trace
it back to Bill Clinton, you trace it back to George W. Bush, and very
little of President Obama. In that sense, \[\...\] Obama has not been
felt in Africa."33 Second, by choosing Senegal, South Africa, and
Tanzania, the U.S. shows its eagerness to trade with democratic African
nations, more than its will to address the root problem of putting
illiberal countries and failing states on the road to free market
democracy. Moreover, [[the military component of American engagement in
Africa seems also **trapped** in a strategic
"catch-22"]{.underline}]{.mark}. Indeed, [[AFRICOM has had to face
**existential dilemmas** since its creation]{.underline}]{.mark} in
2008. A spin-off from EUCOM, sharing the continent with CENTCOM (which
maintains its "traditional relationship"34 with Egypt),its autonomy has
always faced difficulties. Symbolically, the location of AFRICOM's
headquarters in Stuttgart followed a controversy about its implantation
on the African continent,35 hampering its credibility. Operationally, it
has been heavily dependent on other commands (notably EUCOM and CENTCOM)
and has faced subsequent difficulties when leading Operation Odyssey
Dawn over Libya.36 In times of financial constraints, the idea of
AFRICOM's dissolution has even surfaced within a broader realignment of
the COCOMs.37 These rumors have seen no concretization yet. In fact,
some analysts even characterize an American "surge in Africa" in
2013:38 special operations have taken place in Somalia and Libya, and
the U.S. increases its mentoring of African troops for counter-
terrorism.39 However, [[the same analysts worry that the emphasis of
U.S. Africa policy tends to focus on **military actions**, thereby
narrowing the grand design of a U.S. Africa
strategy]{.mark}.]{.underline} Indeed, [[if only the military part of
the 2012 U.S. Strategy for Sub-Saharan Africa is being implemented, this
focus on hard power appears inadequate in **comparison to China's broad
approach of its African affairs.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Renewed American investment in containment of Africa through programs like Africom is plausible only due to the shift from the "Asia pivot" to Africa in which those weapons and resources are shifted to Africa.

Either defining or dismissing the concept, [[analysts cannot resist
invoking a "**new Cold War**"]{.mark}1 [between **China and the U.S**..
The position of Africa in this paradigm remains
**crucial**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as it was during the bipolar era.
Realists tend to put it in an ontological perspective: "Evidence that
China was expanding its interactions with \[\...\] Africa \[\...\]
raised the specter of a new global rivalry for power and
influence."2 Moreover, avoiding a too simplistic analogy with the USSR,
they also underline a unique consequential feature: "But China is
dependent on overseas markets and raw materials, unlike the autarkic
Soviet Union, which will give it powerful incentives to interfere in
many places round the globe"3. For this school of thought, China's
"development will lead to more friction with the United States." Less
euphemistically, although "\[a\] war between China and America is far
from inevitable, \[ if \] inexperienced, reckless or over-confident
leaders come to power on either side, the danger of war will
rise."4 [[The]{.mark} [appropriate strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}, in the
same vein, [[encompasses an **actualized** **version of containment**,
for "America's most natural and instinctive response to **China's**
challenge is to push back]{.underline}]{.mark}."5 However, [[this
offensive reaction renders America's famous **pivot to Asia** either
incompatible or unsustainable]{.underline}]{.mark}. Accordingly, John J.
Mearsheimer describes two global containment scenarios that this essay
applies in regards to Africa. [[First]{.underline}]{.mark}, if the pivot
to Asia allows "China \[to\] become a regional hegemon \[in this case,
in Africa\], the U.S. simply may not be able to contain it."6 From this
declinist point of view, the competition is already lost, as a natural
evolution of the global balance of powers. In that case, [[the American
laissez-faire attitude that necessarily derives from it **contradicts**
the proactive stance of current American projects for
Africa]{.mark}7]{.underline}. [[The second hypothesis assumes that "the
**Chinese economy** will continue to rise but not at such a rapid
clip]{.underline}]{.mark}, in which case the U.S. will be in a good
position to contain China."8 Such a hard power showdown is also
self-defeating. Indeed, [[the success of **containment** supposes a
renewed U.S. commitment in Africa, with strength and will. The former
requires massive economic and military
resources,]{.underline} ]{.mark}which are[, [by presidential choice and
**budget constraints**, directed towards East Asia]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The latter suffers from the fact that, in the economic and diplomatic
realm, "\[\...\] the stakes for China in \[Africa\] will always, in the
end, be higher than for America."9

 

#### The model minority myth perpetuates the anti-black narrative that Black suffering is caused by their inability to pull themselves up by their bootstraps

**Nakagawa 13**

\[Scot Nakagawa, credentials, July 14, 2013, "So, I Ask You, What If
Trayvon Martin Was Asian?",
<http://www.racefiles.com/2013/07/14/so-i-ask-you-what-if-trayvon-martin-was-asian/>,
Accessed: 07/02/2019, KW\]

Last year, I asked the question, [What If Trayvon Martin was
Asian?]{.underline} The post, included below, is timely now in light of
all of the warnings against rioting in reaction to the verdict in the
George Zimmerman case that all seem to target African Americans. [[The
sentiment seems]{.mark} to be [that when African Americans]{.mark}
[don't get their way, violence is]{.mark} likely [to follow. But the
reality is that the most damaging race riots in U.S. history have been
led by whites against people of color]{.mark}. In 1923, in Levy County,
Florida, a white woman accused a black man of sexually assaulting her.
Over two-hundred whites descended upon the city of Rosewood, the town in
which the alleged assailant resided, and incited a riot that resulted in
the deaths of at least six blacks and two whites. The riot also
completely destroyed Rosewood which was later abandoned. In Bellingham,
Washington in 1907, hundreds of whites marched against Sikh immigrant
workers, demanding they be fired immediately. When their demands weren't
met, a mob of 150 whites rioted, assaulting Sikh workers and corralling
them into the basement of Bellingham City Hall. Police officers
cooperated with the rioters, using the same rationale that would be used
40 years later to imprison Japanese Americans in concentration camps:
that holding the Sikhs in captivity would reduce violence. No rioters
were brought to trial, and their actions were widely supported by white
people in Bellingham, some of whom claimed Sikh men had insulted white
women. In 1951, 4,000 whites rioted to srop a black family from moving
into the all-white Cicero neighborhood of Chicago. Police did next to
nothing to stop the rioters who also stoned the firemen who called in to
put out the fires started by the rioters. It took the Illinois National
Guard to finally put an end to the violence. And these are just a few
incidents in which angry whites have rioted, taking the lives of both
white people and people of color in an effort to preserve white
privileges. And, as long as the list of historic events of [this]{.mark}
sort is, it [doesn't]{.mark} [even begin to address the history of
organized terrorism against people of color waged through white-led
organizations]{.mark} like the Ku Klux Klan. Yet, in spite of all of
this evidence of potential violence by whites, there has been no
speculation concerning riots in response to a guilty verdict in the
Zimmerman trial, and all concerns of a post-not guilty verdict center on
Blacks]{.underline}. Makes you go hmmm, doesn't it? [But [what if
Trayvon Martin was Asian]{.mark}? Here's what I had to say about that
last year: In a Daily Kos article, Laurence Lewis asks the provocative
question, "What if Trayvon Martin had been white and George Zimmerman
were Black?" I'm guessing you get the point]{.underline}. Clearly, if
the races were reversed, things would be very, very different. [But this
got me to thinking, what [if]{.mark} Trayvon [Martin had been
Asian]{.mark}, say Japanese American for example? [Would he have been
profiled as a potential menace? Would he have]{.mark} [provoked]{.mark}
George [Zimmerman to say]{.mark}, as revealed on the 911 recording,
"[These a\*\*holes always get away"]{.mark}? I'm guessing, [no]{.mark}.
Moreover, a Japanese American Trayvon would be exempt from the kind of
character assassination being attempted by right wingers. [No one would
be combing his school records for evidence that he was a troublemaker.
And if it turned out he was once caught with a little pot, it's not
likely he'd be labeled a drug dealer]{.mark}. And would White
conservatives be defending the adult Zimmerman by presenting evidence
that an Asian minor, described by his teacher as a cheerful A and B
student, was suspended from school? I doubt it.]{.underline} Nor would
Bill O'Reilly speculate that an innocent verdict for Zimmerman "could
very well lead to violence as we saw in the Rodney King case." [The
Japanese American community up in arms rioting is not exactly the
nightmare vision keeping conservative white folks up at night. In fact,
imagining the victim of this tragedy as Asian American makes our
society's negative stereotyping of African Americans especially
apparent. Why? Because [Asian Americans are subject to a]{.mark}
different kind of [stereotype that was created as a foil to the]{.mark}
racist, [victim-blaming narrative concerning African Americans that
continues to serve as]{.mark} a [justification for]{.mark}
[attacking]{.mark} the [welfare]{.mark} state. [That stereotype casts
Asian Americans as the **model minority**]{.mark}: a group of mathletic
(though not athletic) super-achievers, overcoming prejudice and economic
disadvantage, not by protest, but through hard work and uncritical
patriotism]{.underline}. The model minority myth popped up in the media
during the Civil Rights era in a 1966 New York Times Magazine article
entitled, "Success Story: Japanese American Style." Until then, Asian
Americans were mostly labeled as evil outsiders in order to justify
immigration limits and Japanese American internment during World War II.
But [in the midst of Black uprisings and protests, the article recast
Japanese Americans as [a group that had]{.mark} quietly and politely
[pulled itself up by its bootstraps in spite of]{.mark} terrible
[obstacles]{.mark}]{.underline} (like being put in concentration camps
because, well, you're making white people nervous 'cuz you're Japanese
American[). The article made the claim that Japanese Americans have a
strong culture that values work, family and education that prevents
J.A.s from becoming a "problem minority." Problem minority? W.T.F! But
the idea caught on, and over time, the myth expanded to Asians in
general]{.underline}. By the 1980s, Ronald Reagan twice publicly
congratulated Asian Americans for their success, while smacking down
African Americans for supposed dependency on welfare. And in a "some of
my best friends are Black" move, Reagan used Black conservative Alan
Keyes as a wing man in this strategy. Reagan's [crazy [false logic says
that if Asian Americans can succeed in spite of]{.mark} terrible
[obstacles, then]{.mark} persistent [poverty among African Americans
must be]{.mark} the [product of a defect in Black culture or]{.mark}
Black [people]{.mark}.]{.underline} And while Reagan was praising Asian
Americans, the architects of the Reagan revolution were confounding
attempts on the part of Black people to achieve success by ginning up
anti-Black racism in order to attack welfare. I'd call Reagan a genius,
except, well, that would be a compliment, and I just can't go there.
[[Nowadays, the model minority myth is]{.mark} just [accepted as truth,
even by lots of Asians]{.mark}. In fact, many Asian Americans commit
what they presume to be a victimless crime by taking cover behind the
myth of the model minority]{.underline}. But there are victims, and they
aren't only non-Asians. The victims include 54% of Asian American kids
who claim to be bullied at school, at least in part, as a result of
stereotyping. And, it includes the members of Asian ethnic groups that
haven't been so successful, such as Bangladeshis, Laotians, Cambodians
and the Hmong, all of whom have lower per capita incomes than African
Americans. The model minority myth marginalizes, even makes invisible,
their suffering. But [the greatest danger of anti-Asian stereotyping,
whether it is "positive" or not, is that it continues to hold Asian
Americans separate from other people]{.underline}. And this makes us
vulnerable to the flip side of the myth of Asian exceptionalism: the
idea of Asian Americans as a threat to "American" jobs. It was this kind
of stereotyping that led to the murder of Vincent Chin, a Chinese
American man who was beaten to death by displaced auto workers in 1982
during the U.S. vs. Japan auto wars because he was mistakenly perceived
to be Japanese. And, BTW, neither assailant ever did any jail time. And
today, as China's rise as an economic superpower inspires anxiety, even
hatred, of the Chinese, the specter of more Vincent Chin's ought to get
us wondering, is it ever a good thing to be used, no matter what the pay
off? Today, in the wake of the innocent verdict in the George Zimmerman
case, I feel compelled to add this: [The [stereotypes that afflict
African Americans and Asian Americans may be]{.mark} very [different,
but they are really flip sides of one card;]{.mark} a race card if you
will. [We would be wise to recognize this, and work]{.mark} together [to
destroy these stereotypes of the model and problem minority]{.mark}, or
Asians may be among the Trayvon Martins looming in our
future.]{.underline}

#### The model minority myth perpetuates anti-black violence -- it poses African Americans as the "problem" minority that doesn't work hard enough to overcome hardships and drives a wedge between African and Asian American communities, even though the two have a very intertwined history in America

"We are threatened, unlike most whites, by efforts to use our race
against us." --Frank Wu [[Asians are good at math and science. They're
successful economically and academically. They are hard working and high
achieving.]{.mark} While these tropes may seem outdated, they're still
well known and recognizable.]{.underline} For example, the other day,
just to see what Google searches were most popular, I searched: "Why
are..." and the first thing that came up was: "Why are Asians so smart?"
Who are these 'Asians' that people keep talking about? [While
[these]{.mark} sorts of [comments]{.mark} might seem like compliments or
affirmations, they are actually overly simplistic generalizations that
reveal the devious and exploitative nature of race and racism in the
United States. And they all [fall under the model minority myth]{.mark}
-- a stereotype that generalizes Asian Americans by depicting them as
the perfect example of an if-they-can-do-it-so-can-you success story.
This myth is also a political strategy that highlights the success of
Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Indian immigrants with a specific
professional and educational background. It is [a]{.mark} historical and
presently used [tool designed to protect institutionalized white
supremacy and validate anti-black racism.]{.mark}]{.underline} For a
long time, Asian American activists have worked to debunk the model
minority myth by discussing its negative consequences and impacts. By
positioning of some Asian American groups as a model of success in the
United States, we also need to ask: "A model for whom?" [[Standing up
against the myth has been a]{.mark} long-time [call to action]{.mark}
that has recently been [re-incited by non-indictment verdicts for the
murders of Eric Garner and Mike Brown, as well as]{.mark} the murders of
[many others in the Black community]{.mark}.]{.underline} This sentiment
is currently amplified by social media movements like
#ModelMinorityMutiny and #StartTheConversation, which push for Asian
Americans to stand in solidarity alongside other communities of color
and to debunk the model minority myth in everyday conversations about
racism. [[Here are some ways]{.mark} to unpack why [the model minority
myth is used as a tool of oppression, especially one that perpetuates
anti-black racism.]{.mark} 1. [The myth fosters internalized racism
within]{.mark} certain [Asian American communities against other
communities of color.]{.mark}]{.underline} In order to begin undoing the
myth, we must also begin to tackle the ways we've internalized
anti-blackness. [Often, [our communities use racist rhetoric that's
disguised as casual observation]{.mark} or advice: [They just need to
work harder, don't date them, or don't go to their neighborhood.]{.mark}
[The myth can be a]{.mark} protective [buffer against]{.mark} the
[stigma of]{.mark} being seen as ["outsiders."]{.mark}]{.underline}
Being cast as 'perpetual foreigners' fueled a desire for some Asian
immigrants to survive by seeking ways to fit in and belong, to have
access to the same resources and privileges as those with the most
economic and political power -- wealthy, white Americans. As a result,
we sometimes subconsciously and consciously act protective and proud of
that "model" status. If we're the model of success, then surely we'll be
free from the persecution of those who don't, won't, and can't adhere to
the standard? Right? [But [it is through this very]{.mark} orchestrated
[messaging that we've been conditioned to forget that America is]{.mark}
stolen [land.]{.mark} It is occupied land. It is a country [built on
slave labor and]{.mark} the [colonization]{.mark} of its indigenous
people.]{.underline} Yet, America, to some Asian Americans, is viewed as
a "promised land," and many of us came to the United States with a
belief that there were opportunities to live free from oppression.
Moving forward, we need to re-examine who gives those promises,
recognize the villainy behind why they were offered, acknowledge whom we
are truly taking them from, and heal from the way they have hurt our
diverse communities. We need stand up against the model minority myth
and demand resistance against white supremacy and that means letting go
of the idea of the "American Dream." [2. [The model minority myth
divides people of color and specifically serves as a tool of anti-black
racism.]{.mark} Racial myths and stereotypes are often used as a "wedge"
to divide groups, whether it's creating unfair racial hierarchies or
emphasizing elements of cultural and racial superiority and/or
inferiority.]{.underline} In this specific case, [[the model minority
myth is successful because it constructs Black people as a "problem"
minority. It teaches]{.mark} some [Asian Americans to compare where we
are]{.mark} and what we've accomplished [with where Black Americans
are]{.mark} and what they've accomplished]{.underline}. It turns us into
juxtapositions and situates us as racial binaries. Asian Americans have
different histories of oppression than other communities, and it's
unfair to compare existing struggles. This is rarely talked about
outside of activist communities, but some [Asian immigrants were
intentionally selected to be model minorities]{.underline}, which we'll
discuss more below. [[Rooted in the 'pull yourself up by the bootstraps'
ideology, the term 'model minority' was popularized during the]{.mark}
1960's [Civil Rights Movement]{.mark} -- this stereotype is racist to
both Asian Americans and Black Americans. By creating [a narrative that
hard work equates success]{.mark}, it [negates past and present
structural barriers]{.mark} that interrupt success for different
marginalized groups. The "[success" of certain]{.mark} groups of [Asian
Americans was contrasted with]{.mark} the "[failure" of African
Americans]{.mark}. The myth comes hand in hand with other statements
like, "If Asians can be successful by working hard, why can't Black
people?" It serves as a functional stereotype that uplifted the
narrative of meritocracy and the American Dream.]{.underline} In
witnessing family friends and relatives talk about their life
experiences, themes of hard work and sacrifice are the most salient. My
own parents believe that they have worked hard to get to where they are.
At some point since they immigrated here, they have learned to believe
in the narrative that anyone can find success if they just work hard
enough. [However, [to accept any positive stereotype about the model
minority myth is to]{.mark} also [comply with a racist system that
favors]{.mark} and privileges [whiteness]{.mark} -- and that is
something that not only harms other people of color, it hurts members in
our own communities. 3. The myth also serves to create "good" immigrants
and "bad" immigrants.]{.underline} The myth creates the idea that some
people deserve to be in the U.S. and some people don't. Some immigrants
are lazy. Some snuck in to take away jobs from hard-working "Americans."
Immigration policies purposefully included and excluded certain groups.
For example, the 1965 Immigration Act allowed Asians, specifically East
Asians, of a certain educational and class background into the United
States. However, the model minority myth equates voluntary immigrant
experiences with the experiences of those who have descended from
slavery and those who arrived involuntarily and/or by force, such as a
result of war or U.S. colonization and expansion projects abroad. My
parents immigrated to the U.S. seeking political freedom and better
economic and educational opportunities. Yet, these freedoms and
opportunities are actually limited. They are offered as placations that
obscure violent histories and institutions of slavery, colonialism, war,
and genocide. These opportunities selectively include and exclude
different communities' ability to participate. [4. The myth flattens and
erases Asian American identity. Asian American identities that don't
abide by the model minority rulebook are deemed invalid. Our validity
and value is determined by our utility in preserving the racial
hierarchy.]{.underline} Not only is it eugenic to ascribe character
traits, like quiet, polite, and obedient, to an entire racial group, the
myth prevents coalition building within our diverse Asian American
communities. There are radically different histories, experiences, and
oppressions across the Asian American diaspora, yet often, we are lumped
together as one ambiguous other. Whenever people think about 'Asian'
identities, they think specifically of East Asian identities, such as
Chinese, Japanese, or Korean. Other groups in the Asian and Pacific
Islander diaspora are erased, and their lived realities and challenges
are diminished. Assuming all Asians are the same, the myth also creates
a mono-dimensional Asian American without regard to intersections. It
does not take into account class, citizenship, language, gender,
sexuality, ability, religion or other social identities. [5. [The model
minority myth is used to deny racial justice]{.mark}.]{.underline} In
invoking this myth, policymakers also fail to recognize existing
inequities and create access for Asian American and Pacific Islander
(AAPI) subgroups and other racial groups. The myth makes the economic
and educational struggles of low-income AAPI families, Pacific
Islanders, Southeast Asian refugees, undocumented immigrants, and other
groups invisible -- its unambiguity and inaccuracy makes it a convenient
narrative that prevents solutions to racial and socioeconomic inequity.
For example, only 12-13% of Hmong, Cambodian, and Laotian Americans have
a college degree and less than 10% of Samoan-Americans do. 2.3 million
Asian Americans are uninsured. AAPI groups suffer from physical and
mental health disorders due to lack of culturally competent care.
They're left out of leadership roles at the top of organizations. Many
AAPI groups also live in poverty, face labor exploitation, and are
disenfranchised from the education system[. [Focusing on those that are
doing well makes the issues of those who aren't far less
visible.]{.mark} We also need to begin to understand different histories
and state policies in order to tackle the construction of one model
minority against a problem minority. Historically, [the myth was created
to diminish the Black community's demands for equal rights]{.mark}
during the Civil Rights era. By creating a racial hierarchy, [the
myth]{.mark} also [started to prevent solidarity movements between the
two communities.]{.mark} 6. The model minority myth erases shared
histories of oppression and of solidarity. [There is a long legacy of
solidarity and shared oppression between Asian immigrants and enslaved
Black folks.]{.mark} [Most versions of history disconnect the study of
slavery from the study of Asian]{.mark} and Latinx [immigration]{.mark},
leaving out stories of transracial struggle.]{.underline} Asian
immigrants, such as the Chinese, have historically and strategically
been thought of as both bridges and wedges between white folks and Black
folks. [For example, throughout the 19th century, Chinese "coolie"
laborers, lived in an intermediary position between slavery and free
labor. After the 1850's, labor became explicitly racialized when Britain
brought Chinese laborers to the Caribbean as a solution to suppress
Black slave rebellion. The Chinese were given the social potential to
form a "middle class family" in order to create a racial hierarchy with
White people at the top, Black people at the bottom, and Chinese people
somewhere in between. Black activists like Frederick Douglass link Black
slavery and Chinese "coolie" labor together in system that strategically
separated and these two racial identities and then exploited these
divisions. Some examples of earlier solidarity movements that are erased
from history books include: In the 1920s, the black Brotherhood of
Sleeping Car Workers issued a statement of solidarity with Filipino
workers that were used to break a strike. During the 1930s, in Seattle,
coalitions across Japanese, Chinese, and Filipino American communities
emerged to fight against bills that would have made interracial marriage
illegal. In the Mississippi Delta, Chinese workers were recruited to
work cotton fields during the Reconstruction era. When contracts
expired, some stayed to open grocery stories -- these stores mostly sold
to Black clientele and also offered an alternative to commissaries run
by former plantation owners. Civil Rights movements helped end racist
immigration laws against South Asians. In the late 1960s, Asian
Americans were part of the Third World Liberation Strikes in Berkeley
that launched the Black Power movement and inspired the Yellow Power
movement. Asian American activists like Grace Lee Boggs and Yuri
Kochiyama worked hard to build interracial solidarity and worked closely
with leaders like Malcolm X. As a way to destabilize the model minority
myth and construct an alternate history, historian Vivek Bald examined
the relationship between Bengali migrants and the African American
community in Harlem and showed how racial lines between "Asian-ness" and
"Black-ness" blurred. Bengali migrants experienced anti-black racism and
witnessed black anti-racist organizing. This history of cross-racial
solidarity allows possibilities of a connected, holistic, radical
movement towards racial justice.]{.underline} We can begin to resist
oppression by unlearning Euro-centric narratives of U.S. history. \*\*\*
Although the myth has created incentives for silent complicity in a
racial system with "winners" and "losers," this complicity costs us real
solidarity and justice. [How can we begin to act upon a commitment to
social justice and build solidarity with those that we have also
oppressed in our own struggles?]{.underline} Drawing from the title of
the critical transformative justice anthology, by Jai Dulani, Ching-in
Chen, and Leah Lahshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha: The revolution starts at
home. This begins with reflecting on our own privilege, power, and
identity. It means owning and admitting complicity in a racist system
that we may feel guilty or defensive about. It means having vulnerable
and sometimes difficult conversations with families, friends, and others
that we love, respect, and trust. In beginning to have conversations
with others like my parents, I also have realized that not engaging in
the conversation is an underestimation of them. Assuming that they won't
understand or won't care is an unfair and exclusionary characterization
that they don't have a place in racial justice movements. Asian American
communities are not just bridges or wedges for other groups of color.
[Uniting under the term people of color allows for building solidarity
between movements that also allows for different racial histories. In
order to resist white supremacy in a meaningful way, we need to build
coalitions across communities of color in order to share and
redistribute power and combat racism rooted in anti-blackness and
colonialism]{.underline}. Power can come from communities coming
together to demand justice. This solidarity can help us more equitably
redistribute resources and labor, take care of ourselves and each other,
and center the needs of those most impacted by violence. [By confronting
the mutual enemy of systemic racism, these coalitions can disrupt
history and cycles of oppression. Partnerships that are fluid, critical,
holistic, intersectional, and inclusive offer solutions that include and
address multiple perspectives and issues. We need to acknowledge past
and present complicity and complacency in perpetuating anti-black racism
and moving past guilt and desire for forgiveness.]{.underline} We need
to truly want change. We can begin doing transformative, accountable
work by knowing when to start speaking up without usurping another
voice. We can have diverse, horizontal leadership across communities
where all forms of contributions are valued. We can participate and show
up the way others ask us to. We can begin to self-reflect on different
forms of privilege and power. [[For me, in standing up against the model
minority myth, I am]{.mark} also [refusing further complicity in
reinforcing anti-black racism.]{.mark}]{.underline}

##  Black Criminality

#### Negrophobia mobilizes black criminalization which is a weapon of white supremacy and Black de-valuation.

While this film has been characterized as a cinematic masterpiece, it
greatly advanced the aims of White Supremacy. In particular, this film
had a deleterious effect on African American males because they were
depicted as brutes whose sole intent in life was to rape White women and
destroy the White man's way of life (Loewen, 2007). [As an effective Ku
Klux Klan recruitment tool, this film galvanized support for the Klan as
the preeminent savior of White southern civilization. So far-reaching
was the negative effects of this movie for African American people,
during a private White House screening by-then President Woodrow Wilson,
he reportedly described the film as painting an accurate portrait of
African Americans]{.underline} (Loewen, 2007). In short, this film was a
catalyst for most of the early 20th century media caricatures of African
Americans that still exist today (Baker, 1996; Menzel- Baker, Motley, &
Henderson, 2004). The aforementioned images of African Americans have
contributed to what Armour (1997) calls **[[Negrophobia, or an
irrational fear of African Americans]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This
irrational fear **[[has contributed to Whites' general desensitization
to African American suffering of all types as well as decreased support
for social safety nets. Thus, African American males are devalued and
seen as expendable]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Burrell, 2010).
Unfortunately, **[[Black as a metaphor for criminality is so deeply
embedded in the minds of societal members that Whites have reported
seeing an African American criminal suspect at the scene of a crime when
none was actually present]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Chaney & Robertson,
2013b; Leverentz, 2012; Oliver & Fonash, 2002). In a study to determine
the effect of network news images on viewer perceptions, Dixon (2008)
found that exposure to network news depressed estimates of African
American income, increased the endorsement of stereotypes of African
Americans as poor and intimidating, and were associated with higher
racism scores**[. Media characterizations of violent criminals as Black
has been deeply etched in the psyche of many viewers]{.underline}**
(Dixon & Maddox, 2005; Leverentz, 2012; Oliver & Fonash, 2002; Oliver,
Jackson, Moses, & Dangerfield, 2004). **[Such]{.underline}** negative
**[portrayals]{.underline}** of African Americans in media **[have
resulted in wanton stereotyping, extreme fear of African Americans, and
African Americans with darker complexions and more Afrocentric
phenotypic features being perceived as more worthy of the death penalty
in research experiments]{.underline}** (Blair, Judd, & Chapleau 2004;
Chaney & Robertson, 2013b; Dixon, 2008; Eberhardt, Davies,
Purdie-Vaughns, & Johnson, 2006; Maddox & Gray, 2002; Peffley & Hurwitz,
2013). All of **[[the aforementioned serve to legitimize White
supremacy]{.mark}, legitimize White life, [and de-legitimize African
American life]{.mark} so that incidents of police violence against
African Americans are not punished nor viewed as a larger societal
problem.]{.underline}**

#### In the courthouse, Blackness is always already criminalized and blamed.

Since **[[members of law enforcement play a pivotal role in maintaining
White Supremacy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, it should not come as a surprise
that **[[Whites are generally desensitized to police use of excessive
force against African Americans in general, and African American
men]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in particular. In a recent poll administered
by the 2014 General Social Survey conducted by the independent research
center the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of
Chicago, seven of ten White Americans polled posited they could envision
a condition in which they would endorse an officer striking an adult
male citizen. On the contrary, slightly more than four of ten African
Americans (42%) and slightly less than four of ten Latinos (38%) would
approve of such an action (Holland, 2015). **[In an analysis of accounts
of more than 12,000 police homicides from 1980 to 2012 contained in the
FBI's supplementary homicide report, young African American men (ages
15- 19) were twenty-one times more likely to get killed by police than
their White counterparts]{.underline}** (Gabrielson, Jones, & Sagara,
2014). Additionally, the analysis found that African American police
officers account for only 10% of police killings and 78% of their
victims are African American whereas White officers killed 91% of Whites
who died at the hands of police and were responsible for 68% of deaths
of people of color at the hands of police (Gabrielson et al., 2014).
Even more disturbing is the fact that the above figures are a gross
under-representation as police departments are not required to submit
records of fatal shootings. In fact, **[several police departments have
not submitted data regarding the number and/or circumstances of fatal
shootings to the FBI in years.]{.underline}** For instance, New York
City has not submitted fatal shooting data to the FBI since 2007
(Gabrielson et al., 2014). Generally speaking, **[[police officers do
not serve time for killing African American men]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
According to analysis by The Washington Post and Bowling Green State
University, which was based on public records and interviews with law
enforcement and legal experts, **[it was discovered that officers were
only charged 54 times for killing civilians since 2005]{.underline}**
(Kindy & Kelly, 2015). Also, **[more than three-fourths of the officers
charged were White and two-thirds of the victims were people of color
(all but two were African Americans)]{.underline}**. [Forty-three of the
charged involved the following variables/factors: (1) A victim was shot
in the back; (2) there was a video recording of the incident; (3)
incriminating testimony from fellow officers; or (4) allegations of a
cover-up (Kindy & Kelly, 2015). Of the 54 instances in which officers
were charged, 35 had their cases resolved (21 were acquitted or cases
were dropped) and when convicted they served an average of four years
behind bars, some only a few weeks]{.underline} (Kindy & Kelly, 2005).
Consequently, **[[juries and Whites in general have trouble seeing
African Americans as "true" victims and thus may find it more difficult
to acknowledge Blacks' humanity]{.mark} (]{.underline}**Feagin, 2014;
Fukurai, Butler, & Krooth, 1993; Fukurai, & Krooth, 2003; Tonry, 2011).
As of April 15, 2015, unofficially 255 African Americans have been
killed by agents of law enforcement in the United States in 2015 (Doy
News, 2015). This statistic almost certainly represents an
under-estimate since there is no standardized database on police
killings of African Americans (Chaney & Robertson, 2013a; Gabrielson et
al. 2014). The lack of a large-scale governmental response to this
incessant problem represents a major judicial blemish on the United
States. When examined from a socio-historical context, it appears that
the slave patrols that were a fixture of early policing in America have
not ended, have gained greater force, and that ultimately, the lives of
this nation's African American citizens do not matter.

#### Police brutality emblemizes the inherent dangerousness present in Blackness.

[**[There are four ways that the murders of unarmed Blacks support the
superiority of Whites]{.underline}**.]{.mark} For
[**[one,]{.underline}** **[the murder of unarmed Blacks carries forward
and solidifies the racist legacy of citizen slave patrols that were
initiated during slavery]{.underline}**]{.mark} (Blackmon, 2009;
Dulaney, 1996; Reichel, 1999; Robertson, 2014). Even though castrations,
whippings, maimings, and lynchings (Dulaney, 1996; Loewen, 2005;
Robertson, 2014; Ward, 2012) were frequently used in the South as a
method of policing the activities of African American men from
1880-1950, the transition of these activities to murder by guns is no
less precarious. So, **[regardless of whether these organizations are
referred to as "citizen slave patrols" or "police/law
enforcement"]{.underline}** (Dulaney, 1996; Reichel, 1999; Roediger,
2010; Skolnick & Fyfe, 1993), **[a societal disdain for African
Americans creates a desensitization to Black suffering and death.
[Second,]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[White Supremacy is maintained when
juries refuse to acknowledge the victimization and humanity of African
Americans]{.underline}**]{.mark} (Feagin, 2014; Fukurai, Butlter, &
Krooth, 1993, Tonry, 2011). Since most juries are made up of Whites,
this greatly increases the likelihood that even when members of law
enforcement are on trial, members of this entity will share many of the
same attitudes about Blacks that police generally have. Stated another
way, chances are **[more likely than not that White jury members will
share the same disdain of African Americans that White members of law
enforcement have, and not convict Whites that have murdered unarmed
Blacks.]{.underline}** Ironically, Black members of law enforcement are
part of the larger White Supremacist system of law enforcement that in
many cases provides these minority members the same rights and
protections as Whites. In other words, **[since Black officers are more
likely to hold negative perceptions of Blacks and to be more inclined to
brutalize Black suspects than White ones]{.underline}** (Dulaney, 1996),
**[it stands to reason that Black officers will rarely be penalized for
murdering unarmed Blacks, as well.]{.underline}**
[**[Third]{.underline}**, **[White Supremacy is maintained when Black
men and women are perceived as inherently dangerous and
sub-human]{.underline}**]{.mark} (Donner, 2014; Karenga, 2010; Walker,
2011**[). A blatant example of the "Black man as dangerous and
sub-human" narrative was offered by Officer Darren Wilson, who when he
was allegedly assaulted by the late Michael Brown publicly proclaimed
that "He looked like a demon."]{.underline}** Interestingly, **[the word
"demon" is reminiscent of the Black "brute" that originally entered
America's consciousness in the D.W. Griffith 1915 film The Birth of a
Nation]{.underline}** (Loewen, 2007). During that era, the Black brute's
sole purpose in life was to rape White women and destroy the White man's
way of life. Similarly, **[the contemporary "demon's" sole purpose in
life is to engage in criminal behavior and actively resist law and order
in society.]{.underline}** Furthermore, **[the word "demon" is not only
a painful and erroneous characterization of Blackness that has remained
stable over time, but is a flagrant societal reminder that Blackness
needs to be stopped, regardless of the cost.]{.underline}** In this
context, **[the Black man is triply dangerous because of his dangerous
mindset, his enormous size, and his race, which is inferior to Whites.
In other words, White Supremacy is sustained when Whites embrace the
belief that Black men are a menace to society and that society needs to
be protected from these men via murder.]{.underline}**
[**[Finally,]{.underline}** **[although it is impossible to put a
monetary value on Black life, the general non- indictment of law
enforcement in the murders of unarmed African Americans provides
resounding evidence that little personal accountability exists for these
murders]{.underline}**]{.mark}. While the heads of law enforcement
agencies generally proclaim these deaths as "unfortunate" or "tragic,"
regrettably, as the officer was indicted in only 13 cases (17% of
fatalities), a very weak connection exists between behavior and
consequences for tragic behavior among members of law enforcement.

#### State-sponsored killing via police brutality cements America's promises to criminalize and maim Blackness as the embodiment of danger.

**[[The death of Michael Brown was not an aberration to American
democracy, but the fulfillment of its promises of order and stability
for the (white) majority]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As historian A.J.
William-Myers notes in Destructive Impulses: An Examination of an
American Secret in Race Relations: White Violence, "[white
violence...was part and parcel of the socioeconomic and political
structure of the American democratic process."]{.underline}[11 Pointing
to the "enormous capacity of American democracy to absorb unprecedented
level of violence and not be structurally damaged by it]{.underline},"
Williams-Myers concludes that **[[anti-Black violence and the societal
legitimation of the white agents responsible for the death of Black
people serve to maintain societal order, and bolster the implicit
ideological power of white supremacy in America]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Stated differently, contrary to the democratic calls for justice
currently insisted upon by activists and scholars alike, the deaths of
Black men and boys in America serve to indicate the health of American
democracy not its malaise. For young Black boys, maleness in a white
supremacist society is fraught with difficulty and the all too likely
outcome of death. **[Even as men,]{.underline}** this racialized
masculinity is not thought to result in a recognizable intellectual
maturity, and social standing of a citizen; rather **[the masculinity
impressed upon these Black-male-bodies is known only through its
uncontrollable excess, its lack of maturation, where any and all
transgressions (no matter how small or idiosyncratic) are understood to
be demonstrations of the more primitive and uncivilized aspects of a not
yet evolved savagery.]{.underline}** As Geoffrey Canada, President of
the Harlem Children Zone, remarks, "The image of the male as strong is
mixed with the image of male as violent. Male is virile get confused
with male as promiscuous. Male as adventurous equals male as reckless.
Male as intelligent often gets mixed with male as arrogant, racist, and
sexist ... Boys find themselves pulled and tugged by forces beyond their
control as they make the confusing and sometimes perilous trip to
manhood." The milieu from which Black manhood springs is saturated with
racist caricatures that all seem to legitimate the fear Americans have
of Black men. **[The images and perceptions of Black men as dangerous to
society, women, and themselves ultimately create a pattern of thinking
that works to justify their seemingly inevitable deaths.]{.underline}**
The relationship between anti-Black racism (the hate of Blacks) and
anti-Black chauvinism (the hate of Black males as the barbarous sex) is
not adequately captured by a focus on the manhood denied to Black men
and boys. [Such positions erroneously depict Black men as purely mimetic
creatures incapable of generating identities outside of the decadent
tropes offered by white patriarchy.]{.underline} **[A more correct
analysis of racism and chauvinism would understand that Black male
oppression and death is rooted in an imposition of a deadly masculine
caricature---a barbarism justifying multiple genocidal logics and
encouraging a racist misandry throughout this society and the
disciplines birthed from it.]{.underline}** Ultimately, Black male
suffering is made generic, thought to only be the function of "racism,"
so in an era pushing intellectuals and policy-makers alike to be
antiessentialist (problematizing racial explanations of inequality),
**[Black men are deemed "unfit" for study. [The Black
male]{.mark}]{.underline}** is not born a patriarchal male. He **[[is
raced and sexed peculiarly, configured as barbaric and savage, imagined
to be a violent animal, not a human being.]{.mark} His mere existence
ignites the negrophobia taken to be the agreed upon justification for
his death. [Black male death lessens]{.mark}]{.underline}** their
economic competition with, as well as **[[their political radicality
against, white society]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[It is this
fear]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Black males **[[that allows]{.mark}
society to]{.underline}** **[support the imposition of death on these
bodies, and consent to [the rationalizations the police state offer as
their justifications for killing the Black-male beast (the rapist, the
criminal, and the deviant-thug).]{.mark}]{.underline}** The young Black
male's death, the **[death of Black boys, is merely an extension of this
logic---the need to destroy the Black beast cub before it matures into
full pathology.]{.underline}** The Black boy, that child, is seen **[as
the potential Nigger-beast.]{.underline}** This anti-Black dynamic which
specifically affects the Black boy has been referred to by Elaine Brown
as **[a new kind of racism, a racism built upon the anti-Black mythology
of America's Black males as the super-predator.]{.underline}** This
super-predator mythology not only acts to legitimize the violence
responsible for the deaths of Black males, but inculcates the
rationalization that given what Black males actually are, [**[Black male
death is necessary and an indispensable strategy for the safety and
security of American society]{.underline}**.]{.mark} **[Overlooking the
genocidal disposition of America towards Black males presents an
incomplete diagnosis of the impetus behind the levels of violence and
sanctions imposed upon Black communities (Black women, Black families)
in an effort to control the lives of young Black males.]{.underline}**

#### The trope of criminality is engraved into the flesh of black bodies which makes blackness vulnerable to militarization and fuels the prison industrial complex

Black America,\"
https://www.theroot.com/unprotected-underserved-the-false-criminalization-o-1827083795)//pshah

Any attempt at understanding the effects of policing in black America
must begin from a rational, objective perspective. [[We must]{.mark}
first [free ourselves from the]{.mark} accepted biased
[narrative]{.mark} [that accompanies enforcement of]{.mark} the [law in
black communities]{.mark}---namely that the negative effects of the
criminal-justice system are due to the disproportionate criminality of
the black population.]{.underline} Even the most passionate activists
and allies have subconsciously accepted the prevailing premise. They
will preface their arguments on police brutality by acknowledging the
plague of black-on-black crime and violence in the black community.
[They will acknowledge the fact that black people need to "put down the
guns," "stop the violence" and "do better." To be clear, all violence is
bad. We need to address all crime, whether it is the black-on-black
variety or the kind where white teenagers bring in military weapons to
their 10th-grade social studies class.]{.underline} Black people,
however, are just more likely to break the law, necessitating more
police scrutiny and harsher treatment by law enforcement officers. After
all, these officers are just looking at the statistics and doing their
jobs. But is it true? Is the disproportionate state violence against
black people a result of our disproportionate criminality? Do the
inequities in America's criminal-justice system reflect our misconduct?
Are black people policed this way because of racism? Or are police
brutality, mass incarceration and the war on black bodies a necessary
reality? Let's look at the facts. Numerous academic studies have shown
that crime is largely a socioeconomic phenomenon, including this one,
this one and this one by researchers at the University of Minnesota,
which states: Arrests statistics and much research indicate that poor
people are much more likely than wealthier people to commit street
crime. However, some scholars attribute the greater arrests of poor
people to social class bias against them. Despite this possibility,
[[most criminologists would]{.mark} probably [agree that social class
differences in criminal offending are "unmistakable]{.mark}." [The
disparity]{.mark} in crime and arrest rates [is because African
Americans are twice as likely to fall below the poverty index]{.mark}
and [poor whites are less likely to go to prison than even wealthy
blacks]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to a 2016 study by Duke
University and the New School. Poor people commit crimes, and black
communities, on average, tend to be poorer. Yet [[whenever the subject
of police brutality is brought up, people]{.mark} who belong to the
exclusive Greek-letter organization Mu Alpha Gamma Alpha (I'm pretty
sure that's what "MAGA" stands for) will [pull out]{.mark} their
[bibles]{.mark} [and turn to]{.mark} the newest
[testament]{.mark}---]{.underline}the arrest statistics from the FBI's
Uniform Crime Report. They will point out that African Americans were
arrested for more murders than whites. Therefore, they will explain,
black people are more violent. That's why cops lock them up and shoot
them in the face---case closed. But when one takes a look at all of the
data, the numbers tell a different story. [While [white women]{.mark}
might [clutch their purses when they encounter a black man]{.mark} in a
dark parking lot, in comparison with the black population, [whites
commit more than twice the number of rapes, aggravated assaults,
burglaries, larcenies, arsons, frauds, sex offenses, embezzlement,
disorderly conduct and drug abuse violations, according to FBI]{.mark}
numbers.]{.underline} Although it is true that black people, per capita,
commit crime at higher rates, the vast majority of people, black or
white, do not commit a crime in any given year. The per capita crime
rate is a useless factoid when the reality shows that 95 percent of
black people don't commit a crime in any given year. [[Whenever]{.mark}
almost [any kind of crime is committed]{.mark} in the U.S[., it
is]{.mark} far [more likely that the person responsible is
white]{.mark}. In fact, regarding the importance of per capita crime
rates, [B]{.mark}ureau of [J]{.mark}ustice [S]{.mark}tatistics data
[shows]{.mark} that [the rate of violence among]{.mark} poor, urban
[whites]{.mark} (56.4 per 1,000) [is higher than]{.mark} the violence
rate for urban [black]{.mark}]{.underline}[s]{.mark} (51.3 per 1,000).
Let's put it this way: [If a random police officer had to solve a random
crime without any clues and no knowledge of the perpetrator,
statistically, Officer Random would be right far more often if he
guessed that it was a white person]{.underline}. Furthermore, if
Detective Random stopped a white person on the street, the data shows
that that person is statistically as likely to be a criminal as any
black person. [And [yet black people continue to be policed more
violently and scrutinized]{.mark} more often by law enforcement.
[White]{.mark} [America]{.mark} continues to [push the narrative that
black people are violent criminals]{.mark}, even though the numbers
don't show it. But if we are going to examine black criminality, we must
also investigate the opposite side of the narrative: Are black people
actually targeted by law enforcement? Is it true that cops brutalize,
mistreat and kill black people disproportionately? Let's look at the
numbers: Over the past decade, cities and organizations like the
American Civil Liberties Union have compiled extensive reports and data
on traffic stops and pedestrian searches. The statistics are startling:
In San Francisco, [African Americans are 3.3 times]{.mark}, and Latinos
2.6 times, [more likely]{.mark} than whites [to be searched after a
traffic stop]{.mark}. But according to an ACLU report: "San Francisco
[police officers are significantly **less**]{.mark} [likely to find any
evidence of criminality in searches of African Americans or
Latino]{.mark}s." In Greensboro, N.C. (pdf), blacks made up 55 percent
of traffic stops and were more than twice as likely (102 percent) to be
stopped. However, white drivers were 9 percent more likely to have
contraband. Between 2011 and 2015, the Metropolitan Nashville (Tenn.)
Police Department stopped an average of 1,122 per 1,000 black
drivers---more black drivers than were living in the entire county.
Black drivers in Nashville were five times more likely than whites to be
stopped multiple times in a year. Every year, [more than 75 percent of
the people who were stopped and frisked]{.mark} by the New York City
Police Department [were black or Latino]{.mark}. In Philadelphia,
African Americans accounted for 69 percent of stop and frisks from
January to June 2017 in a city in which they are 48 percent of the
population.]{.underline} Almost every city that conducts these kinds of
studies finds the same results. But it is not just traffic and
pedestrian stops that reveal racially biased policing. [The [Hamilton
Project reveals]{.mark} that, even though [blacks and whites use drugs
at about the same rate, blacks are 6.5 times more likely to be
arrested]{.mark} for drug use.]{.underline} And when it comes to police
shootings, the data is incontrovertible. [A study by the American
Journal of Public Health shows that [black men are three times more
likely to die from police shootings]{.mark}. Even [when they are not
violent and have committed no crimes]{.mark}, black people are still
shot and killed by police officers at higher rates than whites. Although
black people make up 13 percent of the population, in 2017, 34 percent
of the people who were shot and killed when they were unarmed and not
attacking were black, Mapping Police Violence reports. To be clear,
[the]{.mark} disproportionate [number of black people shot by police is
not because black people commit]{.mark} more
[crimes]{.mark}]{.underline}. Data from the Washington Post's police
database shows that there is no correlation between crime rates by race
and the disproportionate number of police shootings. As Justin Nix, a
researcher at the University of Louisville, said, according to the
Washington Post, ["[The only thing that was significant in predicting
whether someone shot and killed by police was unarmed was whether or not
they were black." The facts don't support the
narrative]{.mark}.]{.underline} There is no reason to insert
black-on-black crime into any discussion of police violence. There is no
statistical basis for the way African-American communities are
inordinately victimized by law enforcement. Black criminality is a myth.
All this week, The Root will examine policing in black America. We will
delve into the problems, the perspectives and the solutions to the
inequities in how the law is enforced in communities of color across
America. Because as you can see \... They're doing it wrong.

#### Civil society engenders tropes of criminality and savagery of "beastlike" features onto black flesh -- its in the state of vulnerability that black non-being is incapable of finding a place in the white world.

This latest crisis had begun in the 1860s. [[In a moment]{.mark}
equivalent to a historical blink of the eye, [four million people were
transformed from property to human beings to would-be citizens of the
nation]{.mark}. Only a decade before, [few]{.mark} white
[Americans]{.mark} other than abolitionists [had anticipated that black
people would become]{.mark} the [legal equivalents]{.mark} of white
people. In those outrageously heady days of the 1850s [when slavery
debates still raged]{.mark}, colonization schemes were still being
hatched, and white optimism still percolated for black extinction if
emancipation had to come, [the possibility]{.mark} of living among and
abiding [black judges, politicians, and schoolteachers was]{.mark}, for
many, [unimaginable]{.mark}.2]{.underline} By decade's end the
unimaginable had become reality, and the prospect of settlement and
incorporation of African Americans added urgency and confusion to what
many whites already saw as a desperate situation. "Now, far more than at
any time hitherto[, the white people of the United States . . . seem to
be particularly interested to know precisely what manner of man the
negro \[sic\] is," proclaimed [one writer in his 1868
introduction]{.mark} to The Negroes in Negroland; The Negroes in
America; and Negroes Generally, a timely collection of previously
published statements by some of the most respected Europe an travelers
to Africa and American men of renown.]{.underline} "Of these American
writers, those from the North are here more particularly referred to;
and it is trusted that the reader will ponder well the words of such
truly able and representative men as John Adams, Daniel Webster, Horace
Mann, Theodore Parker, Samuel George Morton, William Henry Seward, and
others of scarcely less distinction." In a nutshell, "disinterested" and
authoritative white men the world over, from Europe an colonists and
anthropologists to American presidents and statesmen, had the same
warning to dispatch, according to Hinton Rowan Helper: ["[Negroes" with
their "crime- stained blackness" could not rise to a plane any higher
than that of "base and beastlike savagery]{.mark}."]{.underline} Helper
presented his collection of expert opinions as an archaeologist uses
fossils to reconstruct some prehistoric creature for the world to behold
with gratitude that it no longer walks the earth. [[In Helper's case,
the caption]{.mark} for posterity [read]{.mark}: [terrible things await
a nation bent on handing ballots to beasts]{.mark}. "[Seeing]{.mark},
then, that [the negro]{.mark} does, indeed, [belong to a lower and
inferior order of beings]{.mark}, why in the name of Heaven,
[why]{.mark}," [he pleaded with his readers]{.mark}, "[should we forever
degrade and disgrace both ourselves and our posterity by
entering]{.mark}, of our own volition, [into more intimate relations
with him]{.mark}?]{.underline} May God, in his restraining mercy, forbid
that we should ever do this most foul and wicked thing!"3 Helper's
warning failed. Reconstruction proceeded, but not before the seeds of
dread, planted by Helper and many other post- emancipation writers,
spread across the nation like crabgrass in June. When Shaler began
writing about the Negro Problem after federal troops had withdrawn from
the South, after ex-Confederates had returned to power, and after the
nation had set itself on a path of reconciliation, those seeds continued
to produce apprehension about a future fraught with peril. "The forecast
of the unprejudiced observer was exceedingly unfavorable. Every
experiment of freeing blacks on this continent," Shaler wrote with
seeming exasperation, "has in the end resulted in even worse conditions
than slavery brought to them." Haiti and Jamaica were perfect
demonstrations of how blacks' "defects" could wreak havoc on
civilization. Haitians had once belonged to a colonial society of great
"fertile lands" and "great industries of sugar and coffee culture" built
on "mild slavery." But with a corrupt government and a failed economy,
["[the black race \[had\] fallen through its freedom to a state that is
but savagery with a little veneer of Europe and customs]{.mark}." These
were "a people without a single trace of promise except that of
extinction through the diseases of sloth and vice."]{.underline} Jamaica
was just as bad. It had once been a "garden land of the tropics," the
"British of the South," but had now become a land of "barbarism."4
America must take heed, Shaler continued. [[Friends of the race]{.mark}
who had not simply fought for blacks' freedom but also demanded their
"complete enfranchisement as American citizens," who by blind faith and
by declaration tried to "fi t them for a place in the structure of a
self- controlling society," [did not realize that "resolutions cannot
help this rooted nature of man."]{.mark} "[The real dangers that this
African blood brings to our state," Shaler cautioned, lay in "the
peculiarities of nature which belong to the negroes as a race." Unlike
in "our own race]{.mark} inheritance," [black brains stopped developing
sooner, leaving "the negroes" with an animal nature unaltered by the
"fruits of civilization]{.mark}." The results were devastating[: blacks
were incapable of controlling their sexual impulses]{.mark}; [they were
unable to work together f]{.mark}or a common purpose; [and]{.mark}, most
importantly, they had no power to delay gratification and plan for the
future.]{.underline} Despite their "charming nature," their "quick
sensibilities," and their "present Americanized shape," these
"peculiarities" were easily overlooked by those who did not "know the
negro by long and large experience," and who falsely believed that they
were like them. With patience and "the opportunity to search closely
into the nature of this race, they will perceive that the inner man is
really as singular, as different in motives from themselves, as his
outward appearance indicates[." "There can be no doubt," Shaler
proclaimed, "that for centuries to come [the task of weaving these
African threads of life into our society will be]{.mark} [the
greatest]{.mark} of all-American [problem]{.mark}s."5]{.underline}

Black crime researchers and reformers in fact contributed to and drew
inspiration from the cultural discourse on crime. [Many [black elites
had embraced Victorian ideals of morality and respectability]{.mark} in
the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries[, often trumping their
white elite counterparts in sophistication and refinement]{.mark}.
[Seeing themselves as]{.mark} walking billboards for the race's
[capacity for equal citizenship]{.mark}, and [distinguishing themselves
from "uncouth" and "criminally inclined"]{.mark} poor [blacks]{.mark},
black elites often employed the language of racial uplift and the
"politics of respectability" to describe black criminality in terms of
class and culture.]{.underline} Their race- relations writings and their
social welfare efforts were often shot through with class bias and
victim- blaming. [At times, black northern elites were especially
contemptuous of southern migrants. In rhetoric alone, when speaking to
all- black audiences or when seeking credibility and financial support
from white benefactors, their talk about black criminality seemed
indistinguishable from that of their white counterparts.]{.underline} In
the first post- civil rights era of the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries--- Jim Crow's early years--- ideology often trumped
race for African Americans vying for political, economic, and social
resources among whites. Conservative black opinion makers and race
reformers who dwelt on the self- destructive behavior of poor blacks
were more likely than antiracist activists to be heralded as clear- eyed
and unbiased by their influential white peers[. [For some African
American writers and reformers, black criminality was a passport to
relevancy in a wider white world in which black voices were actively
suppressed.]{.mark}44 Others, [such as James Stemons, a Philadelphia
race- relations reformer and local crime fighter, used black criminality
to engage in a kind of double- speak: they used the rhetoric of black
criminality to draw attention to themselves for the purposes of
critiquing racism.]{.mark} Often out of genuine concern for public
safety, Stemons, Du Bois, [Wells, and many others did not ignore crime
in their own communities. But neither did they ignore the racial double
standards in the urban crime discourse, the mistreatment of black
suspects and criminals, and the poor quality of police
protection]{.mark} [offered to black communities]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Despite their elitism, many black reformers tended to offer "root- cause
solutions" alongside their class- infused cultural critiques of black
criminality.45 [[Progressive era black social scientists and reformers
also exposed and challenged the limits of racial liberalism]{.mark} long
before the post- World War II failures of residential [and]{.mark}
workplace integration in the urban North [fueled a national civil rights
movement]{.mark} and [set the stage for a national political backlash
against liberalism]{.mark}]{.underline}.46 White social workers and
white philanthropists failed to invest sufficient material resources
into the uplift of African American urbanites, advising these
communities to "work out their own salvation" before others could help
them. [But black progressives cried foul, and they pressed for the same
responses to their needs that were being offered to white working- class
and immigrant urbanites. As much as they embraced the self- help ethos
of the era, and as willing as they were to pull themselves up by their
bootstraps and build churches, settlement houses, schools, businesses,
labor organizations, and entertainment venues in their own communities,
they recognized that, dollar for dollar, African Americans stood most in
need of community investment and economic resources but were least
likely to be helped]{.underline}.47 In the segregated black communities
of the urban North, members of the working class and the elite
recognized that thoughtful, constructive crime prevention cost money,
lots of it. [White philanthropy was the dominant financial source for
all crime- prevention efforts, but native- born poor whites and new
immigrants received the lion's share of attention and aid. The hidden
cost to black residents was not simply victimization by bad guys, but
also brutality by bad police officers and the loss of faith in American
society by the young and old, who saw the police as a representation of
the government's malign neglect of black people in
general]{.underline}.48 As black sociologist Kelly Miller noted,
thoughtful, caring policing was an important solution to inspiring
blacks to invest in their own citizenship. Better policing would lead to
better citizens in a feedback loop.49 The empathy police officers
brought to black communities would be one pathway, he argued, through
which African Americans would come to know they were valued in modern
urban America.50 Beyond their own need to distinguish themselves from
social and cultural inferiors, black reformers noted time and time again
that the stigma of criminality fell most heavily on the most
disadvantaged, isolated, and neglected people of the urban North. As
they saw it, the Progressive era discourse of black criminality was at
its best a self- serving justification for segregation and black
self-help even as its proponents---white elites--- helped Europe's
huddled masses by advocating for social welfare agencies, recreation
facilities, better policing, economic fairness, and an end to political
corruption. At its worst, the stigma of criminality was an intellectual
defense of lynching, colonial-s tyle criminal justice practices, and
genocide.

#### While the afterlife of slavery is far from an abstraction in the lived reality of blackness, recourse to the sociological empirics of suffering already codifies the category of "exploitation" as the base grammar of suffering, ignoring the gratuitousness of anti-black violence and enshrining the call for more public policy as the limit point of our revolutionary demands. Civil society is parasitic by framing blackness as a fugitive condition of which the nation must escape from

[At the dawn of the twentieth century, [in]{.mark} a [rapidly]{.mark}
industrializing, urbanizing, and demographically [shifting
America]{.mark}, [blackness was refashioned through crime statistics. It
became a]{.mark} more [stable]{.mark} racial [category]{.mark} [in
opposition to whiteness]{.mark} [through racial
criminalization]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consequently, white criminality
gradually lost its fearsomeness. [This book asks, [how did Europe and
immigrants]{.mark}--- the Irish and the Italians and the Polish, for
example--- gradually [shed their criminal identities while blacks did
not]{.mark}? In other words, [how did criminality go from plural to
singular]{.mark}? By examining both immigrant and black crime discourses
in the urban North as they w ere mutually constituted by new statistical
data and made meaningful to a Jim Crow nation, we can more easily
discern distinct (and novel) patterns of talking about race and
crime]{.underline}. Rather than following the lead of social historians
of working- class immigrant and black communities who link ethnic
culture to distinct patterns of criminal behavior, this book explores
the genealogy of distinct patterns of racial crime discourses. In the
period under investigation, crime, despite its variability in form and
expression across groups, was a ubiquitous problem across the
nation---so much a problem in the urban North that it was not clear that
blackness would eventually become its sole signifier. Even the
wellsprings of violent crime, as historian and criminologist Jeffrey S.
Adler found in his recent definitive study of homicide in Progressive
era Chicago, flowed from the same broader cultural, social, economic,
and demographic shifts and tensions affecting all non- elite urban
people. "Contrary to the impressions of most observers," he writes,
"[[African American violence was similar to white violence.]{.mark} It
resembled white homicide in the form it took; and African- American
violence paralleled white violence in how that form changed."22 From the
1890s through the 1930s, from the Progressive era through Prohibition,
[African Americans had no monopoly on social banditry, crimes of
resistance, or underground entrepreneurship]{.mark}; the "weapons of the
weak" and "lower- class oppositional culture" extended far and wide and
in many directions.23 The Condemnation of Blackness demonstrates and
explains how [ideas of racial inferiority and crime became fastened to
African Americans by contrast to ideas of class and crime that shaped
views of Europe an immigrants and working- class whites]{.mark}.24
Whiteness scholars have shown how crucial the attributes of skin color,
Europe an ancestry, and the gradual adoption of anti- black racism were
to immigrant assimilation "into the singular 'white race.'
"]{.underline}25 Such benefits, Thomas Guglielmo found recently, even
secured the whiteness of Chicago's "Sicilian Gunmen" because their
criminality "never positioned them as non- white in any sustained or
systematic way."26 Building on whiteness and critical race scholarship,
I explore how postbellum southern black out-migration to the urban
North---to Philadelphia, Chicago, and New York in particular---fueled an
invidious black migration narrative framed by crime statistics and
reshaped broader racial discourses on immigration and urbanization
during Progressive era. [[Evoking the specter of black rapists and
murderers moving north]{.mark} one step ahead of lynch mobs, innovative
racial demographers such as Frederick L. Hoffman [explicitly sanitized
and normalized the criminality of northern white]{.mark} working and
immigrant [classes]{.mark}.]{.underline} Consequently[, [the black
southern migrant--- the "Negro, stranger in our midst]{.mark}"--- [was
marked as an exceptionally dangerous newcomer.]{.mark}]{.underline} One
of the strongest claims this book makes is that statistical comparisons
between the Foreign-born and the Negro were foundational to the
emergence of distinctive modern discourses on race and crime. For all
the ways in which poor Irish immigrants of the mid- nineteenth century
were labeled members of the dangerous classes, criminalized by Anglo-
Saxon police, and over-incarcerated in the nation's failing prisons,
Progressive era social scientists used statistics and sociology to
create a pathway for their redemption and rehabilitation.27 A generation
before the Chicago School of Sociology systematically destroyed the
immigrant house of pathology built by social Darwinists and
eugenicists[, [Progressive era]{.mark} social [scientists]{.mark} [were
innovating]{.mark} environmental [theories of crime and delinquency
while using crime statistics to demonstrate]{.mark} [the assimilability
of the Irish, the Italian, and the Jew by explicit contrast to the
Negro]{.mark}]{.underline}.28 White progressives often discounted crime
statistics or disregarded them altogether in favor of humanizing Europe
an immigrants, as in much of Jane Addams's writings.29 In one of the
first academic textbooks on crime, Charles R. Henderson, a pioneering
University of Chicago social scientist, declared that "the evil \[of
immigrant crime\] is not so great as statistics carelessly interpreted
might prove." He explained that age and sex ratios---too many young
males--- skewed the data. [But [where the "Negro factor" is
concerned]{.mark}, Henderson continued, "[racial inheritance, physical
and mental inferiority, barbarian and slave ancestry and culture,"
were]{.mark} among the "[most serious factors in crime
statistics]{.mark}."]{.underline}30 Similar comparisons would echo for
the rest of the twentieth century. The Progressive era was indeed the
founding moment for the emergence of an enduring statistical discourse
of black dysfunctionality rather than the 1960s, as is commonly
believed. The post-Moynihan social- scientific and public policy view of
black pathology that scholars such as Robin D. G. Kelley criticize as
"ghetto ethnography" began, statistically speaking, in the 1890s. [The
racial project of making blacks the "thing against which normality,
whiteness, and functionality have been defined," was foundational to the
making of modern urban America.31 [Shaped by racial ideology and racism,
the statistical ghetto emerged]{.mark}, study by study, in the
Progressive era as the northern Black Belt formed block by
block]{.underline}.32 Inextricably linked at birth, they grew up
together. [Northern [black crime statistics]{.mark} and migration trends
in the 1890s, 1900s, and 1910s [w ere woven]{.mark} [together into a
c]{.mark}autionary [tale about the exceptional threat black people
posed]{.mark} to modern society.]{.underline} In the Windy City, in the
City of Brotherly Love, and in the nation's Capital of Commerce this
tale was told, infused with symbolic references to American
civilization, to American modernity, and to the fictive promised land of
unending opportunity for all who, regardless of race or class or
nationality, sought their fortunes. In these imagined communities of a
post- slavery, post- Reconstruction civil rights America, "color-blind
universalism" added an additional thread of contempt to the narrative.
[In a moment when most white Americans believed in the declining
significance of racism, statistical evidence of excessive rates of black
arrests and the overrepresentation of black prisoners in the urban North
was seen by many whites as indisputable proof of black inferiority.33
What else but black pathology could explain black failure in these
modern meccas of opportunity?]{.underline} Unlike subsequent
commentators in the 1920s and 1930s, Progressive era white race-
relations writers frequently asserted that racism had nothing to do with
black criminality. They self- consciously critiqued black criminality in
what they perceived to be race- neutral language. The numbers "speak for
themselves" was one frequent refrain, followed by "I am not a racist."34
A variant attached to both rhetorical strategies accused black race-r
elations writers of being biased and sentimental toward their own. They
were accused of "coddling" their own criminals and excusing their
behavior. [[When black experts dug in]{.mark}, when they made forceful
counterarguments of epidemic racism in the heyday of "separate but
equal"---even in the North--- [they were]{.mark} often [charged with
playing the race card]{.mark}]{.underline} (a concept then still in its
infancy). The familiar resonance of these statements and exchanges is a
testament to their longevity in American culture and society.35

#### Civil society maintains the fugitive and criminal trope of blackness, the way whiteness fetishizes black bodies for consumption of criminal fault - Here are the statistics the white people ask for

The body of literature concerning viewers\' interpretations and
responses to news and entertainment programming featuring black men as
criminal suspects illustrates that what viewers \"bring to the screen\"
in terms of their existing attitudes and beliefs plays a profound role
in the media-viewer relationship. With this relationship in mind, the
last section of this paper pertains specifically to viewers\' memory of
crime information. In particular, [in this section I overview research
that I have con- ducted concerning [how]{.mark} biases in the ways in
which [viewers\' mistaken identification of African American men as
criminal suspects]{.mark} featured in news stories not only
[reflects]{.mark} existing [stereotypes of black men as \"dangerous and
criminal,\" but also]{.mark} likely [serves to reinforce
stereotyping]{.mark} in ways that can implicate essentially any black
man as potentially threatening or violent (Oliver, 1999; Oliver &
Fonash, 2002).]{.underline} [Memory and Social Cognition As with
research concerning interpretations and enjoyment, re- search on memory
generally suggests that people tend to recall information about
situations or individuals that is consistent with existing attitudes or
beliefs (Fyock & Stangor, 1994). In this regard, [if individuals]{.mark}
[harbor stereotypes of black men as criminal, biases in memory]{.mark}
should [result in greater recall of black than white criminals]{.mark}
featured in newscasts, and may even result in mistaken memories of
having seen a black suspect portrayed when either no racially
identifying information was provided or when the suspect was actually
white (Drabman, Robertson, Patterson, Jarvie, Hammer, & Cordua, 1981).
Furthermore, [this]{.mark} type of [mistaken recall should be]{.mark}
particularly [likely]{.mark} to occur [when the]{.mark} type of
[crime]{.mark} portrayed [is consistent with stereotypes associated with
African American men]{.mark} (i.e., the crime is violent rather than
nonviolent.]{.underline}) In addition to predicting biases in recall per
se, research on recognition memory also suggests that when trying to
identify who has been seen in a news portrayal from a \"line-up\" of
potential suspects, systematic errors that vary by race may be expected
to occur. In particular, research on social cognition suggests that
people tend to categorize individuals according to a variety of
demographic traits - race included - and tend to perceive that
individuals who are categorized into the same group are particularly
similar or homogenous (Fiske, 1995; Macrae & Bodenhausen, 2000; Taylor &
Falcone, 1982). [Furthermore, if a target\'s category is different from
the perceiver\'s category, [if a white person perceives a black
person]{.mark}, for example, [then perceived]{.mark} [similarity]{.mark}
of the target members [is]{.mark} particularly [heightened]{.mark}. What
does this line of reasoning imply in terms of whites\' memories of news?
[This]{.mark} reasoning [suggests that when white viewers see a newscast
featuring an African American man as a criminal]{.mark} suspect, [not
only are they likely to remember seeing an African American man, but
they are]{.mark} also [likely to confuse the]{.mark} specific
[individual who was pictured with any]{.mark} individual in the same
racial category (i.e. *any* [black man]{.mark}).]{.underline} The
discussion thus far of [news recall has assumed that perceivers\'
mistaken recall and identification memory will mirror existing
stereotypes associating black men with danger or
criminality.]{.underline} On the one hand, given the prevalence and
persistence of this stereotype, this is likely a safe assumption to
make. Nevertheless, there are clearly variations in the extent to which
individuals endorse such stereotypes. Given this variation, should one
assume that only viewers with high levels of racism are likely to
evidence racially-based patterns in their memories of news? In some
regards, the answer to this question appears to be \"yes.\" After all,
if a person does not harbor racist attitudes, then it would seem
unlikely that their memories would reflect stereo- types of black men as
criminal. On the other hand, a growing and substantial body of research
suggests that stereotypes can influence cognitions and behaviors in ways
that are largely outside of individuals\' cognitive awareness (Bargh,
1999; Devine, 1989; Devine & Monteith, 1999; Fazio, Jackson, Dunton, &
Williams, 1995). [In general, this research on \"implicit stereotyping\"
suggests that [most every-]{.mark} [one is]{.mark} at least [aware of
racial stereotypes, and]{.mark} therefore when a member of a stigmatized
group is encountered, [these stereo- types are \"primed\"
regardless]{.mark} [of the extent to which the stereotypes are
endorsed.]{.mark}]{.underline} While individuals who are \"low\" on
measures of racial prejudice may generally be likely to disregard or
inhibit primed stereotypical cognitions, these same individuals to mind,
nor may they always have the cognitive resources avail- may not always
be aware when stereotypes have been brought able to engage in stereotype
inhibition. Consequently, primed stereotypes (or implicit stereotypes)
have the potential to influence the behaviors and perceptions of all
individuals, regardless of their stated or endorsed racial attitudes. To
examine what research in social cognition and implicit stereotyping
imply about memory of criminal suspects, [we]{.underline} (Oliver &
Fonash, 2002) [conducted an experiment in which white viewers first
completed a questionnaire that included the anti-black attitude scale
(Katz & Hass, 1988) as a means of assessing racist attitudes.
Approximately two weeks later, these same individuals examined a series
of brief newspaper stories that included two news sections pertaining to
crime. These two sections featured a total of two stories featuring
violent crimes (murder and rape), and two stories featuring nonviolent
crimes (embezzlement and mail fraud). Among these four stories, two
featured a photograph of a black male criminal suspect, and two featured
a photograph of a white male criminal suspect. [Although the orders of
the stories and the pairing of the photographs and the stories were
varied, all participants in the study saw a black male paired with a
violent crime and a nonviolent crime]{.mark}, and a white male paired
with a violent crime and a nonviolent crime. After viewing the news
stories, participants were asked to complete a series of questionnaires
pertaining to their perceptions of the stories, with many of these
questions designed only to detract their attention from the true purpose
of the study. Subsequently, participants were then presented with a
series of photographs of individuals, and were asked to indicate the
likelihood that each individual was the one featured in each of the
crime stories examined using scales ranging from 1 (Definitely Not
Pictured in the News Story) to 7 ( Definitely Was Pictured in the News
Story). Among the photographs included in this task, three photographs
were of African American men who had not been included in the stories,
and three were of white men who had not been included in the stories.
Hence, the \"correct\" answer for these photographs was \"1\"
(Definitely Not Pictured), with higher scores indicating greater
misidentification. As predicted, [the results revealed that participants
were more likely to misidentify black men as the suspect]{.mark} when
the actual story contained a photograph of a black man ( M = 3.22, SD =
0.82) than a white man ( M = 2.50, SD = 1 .03), t( 59) = 6.14, p \<
.001.]{.underline} On the other hand, similar patterns were revealed for
misidentification of white men, with participants more likely to
misidentify white men when the actual story contained a photograph of a
white man ( M = 3.10, SD = 0.97) than a black man (M = 2.51, SD = 1
.01), t(59) = 4.00, p \< .001. While these findings may appear to
suggest that viewers\' mistaken identification of suspects is equitable
in terms of racial imagery, it is important to keep in mind that in this
study, blacks and whites were represented as criminals in equal
proportions, with care being taken to hold all other variables constant
(e.g., the manner in which the suspect was portrayed). [In contrast, the
aforementioned con- tent analytic studies of actual crime portrayals
demonstrate that [African American men are over-represented as criminals
in the news and are portrayed in ways that make them appear]{.mark}
particularly [dangerous and guilty.]{.mark} Hence, our findings that
black suspects in the news resulted in greater misidentification of
black men as suspects (regardless of white misidentification) suggest
that the disparity of misidentification between black and white men
outside of controlled laboratory conditions employed here may be
particularly pronounced. In addition to this finding, this study also
found evidence that black men were especially likely to be misidentified
with violent rather than nonviolent crime (see Figure 1).]{.underline}
Specifically, our analysis revealed an interaction between the race of
the person in the identification task and the type of crime being
recalled, F (1,58) = 15.76, eta2 = .21, p \< .001. That is, this study
found than when the story was about a violent crime, black men were
particularly likely to be misidentified as the individual who was
pictured. In contrast, white men were somewhat more likely to be
misidentified with nonviolent than violent stories, though this
difference did not reach statistical significance.

#### Civil society functions as a politics of innocence, rendering revolutionary and insurgent politics unimaginable. Innocence becomes a necessary precondition for the launching of mass antiracist political campaigns as blackness itself is considered synonymous with guilt.

While I was reading the local newspaper, I came across a story that
caught my attention. [The article was about a seventeen-year-old boy
from Baltimore named [Isaiah Simmons]{.mark} who [died in a juvenile
facility]{.mark} in 2007, when five to [seven counselors suffocated him
while restraining him]{.mark} for hours. When Simmons was unresponsive,
[the counselors dumped his body in the snow and did not call for medical
assistance]{.mark} for more than forty minutes. [In]{.mark} late March
[2012]{.mark}, the [case was thrown out]{.mark}. [None of the
counselors]{.mark} involved in his murder [were charged]{.mark}. [An
article I found online about the case was titled "Charges
Dropped]{.mark} Against 5 [In]{.mark} Juvenile [Offender's
Death]{.mark}."² By [emphasizing]{.mark} [that it was a juvenile
offender who died]{.mark}, the [article]{.mark} immediately [flags
Simmons as a criminal]{.mark}, [signaling]{.mark} to readers [that his
death is]{.mark} inconsequential and thus [not worthy of
sympathy]{.mark}.]{.underline} Every comment posted on the article was
crude and contemptuous. [[The]{.mark} general [sentiment was that his
death was]{.mark} no big [loss to society]{.mark}.]{.underline} The news
about the case being thrown out barely registered at all.³[[There was
no]{.mark} public [outcry]{.mark}, no call to [action]{.mark}, no
[discussion]{.mark} of the myriad issues bound up with Simmons's death:
youth incarceration, racism, the privatization of prisons and jails (he
died at a private facility), medical neglect, state violence, and so
forth.]{.underline} For weeks after reading the article, I contemplated
these questions: What is the difference between Trayvon Martin and
Isaiah Simmons? Which cases galvanize activists into action, and which
are ignored? In the wake of the Jena Six, Troy Davis, Oscar Grant,
Trayvon Martin, and other high-profile cases,⁴ [I have taken note of the
patterns that structure political appeals, particularly the way
[innocence becomes a necessary]{.mark} [precondition for the launching
of mass antiracist political campaigns]{.mark}.]{.underline} These
campaigns often focus on prosecuting and harshly punishing the
individuals responsible for overt and locatable acts of racist violence,
thus positioning the state and the criminal justice system as allies and
protectors of the oppressed. [[When the "innocence" of a black victim is
not established, he or she will not become a suitable spokesperson for
the cause]{.mark}.⁵ An empathetic structure of feeling based on appeals
to innocence has come to ground contemporary antiracist politics.
[Within this framework,]{.mark} [empathy can be established]{.mark} only
[when a person meets]{.mark} the standards of [authentic victimhood and
moral purity,]{.mark} [which requires black people]{.mark}, in the words
of Frank Wilderson, [to be cleansed]{.mark} of
"niggerization."]{.underline} [Social, political, cultural, and legal
recognition happens only when a person is thoroughly whitewashed,
neutralized, [and made unthreatening]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
"spokesperson" activist model, which involves the isolation of cases
considered "exemplary," also tends to emphasize the individual rather
than the collective nature of racist injuries. [Framing oppression in
terms of individual actors is a liberal tactic that dismantles
collective responses to oppression and diverts attention from structural
violence. [Using "innocence" as the foundation to address antiblack
violence is an appeal to the white imaginary]{.mark},]{.underline}
though these arguments are certainly made by people of color as well.
[Re[lying on this framework re-entrenches a logic that criminalizes race
and constructs docile subjects.]{.mark}]{.underline} [A liberal politics
of recognition can only reproduce a guilt-innocence schematization that
fails to grapple with the fact that [there is an a priori association of
blackness with guilt]{.mark} (criminality).]{.underline} Perhaps
association is too generous---there is a flat-out conflation of the
terms. As Wilderson notes in "Gramsci's Black Marx: Whither the Slave in
Civil Society?" [[the cop's answer to the black subject's question---why
did you shoot me?---follows a tautology: "I shot you because you are
Black; you are Black because I shot you.]{.mark}"⁶]{.underline} In the
words of Frantz Fanon, the cause is the consequence.⁷ [Not only are
[black men assumed guilty until proven innocent]{.mark},
[blackness]{.mark} itself [is considered synonymous with
guilt]{.mark}.⁸]{.underline} Authentic victimhood, passivity, moral
purity, and the adoption of a whitewashed position are necessary for
recognition in the eyes of the state. Wilderson, quoting N.W.A., notes
that "a nigga on the warpath" cannot be a proper subject of empathy. [⁹
The [desire for recognition compels political subjects to seek alliance
with the state and to sacrifice themselves in order to meet]{.mark} the
standards of [victimhood]{.mark}. This is also the logic of rape-revenge
narratives: only after a woman is thoroughly degraded can audiences
begin to tolerate her rage]{.underline} (outside of films and books,
violent women are not tolerated even when they have the "moral" grounds
to fight back, as exemplified by the high rates of women who are
imprisoned or sentenced to death for murdering or assaulting abusive
partners). [Although it is sometimes necessary to make "innocence"
appeals for strategic reasons---to win a case or to influence public
opinion---these strategies become problematic when they reinforce a
framework that renders revolutionary and insurgent politics
unimaginable.]{.underline} The prison abolitionist Ruth Wilson Gilmore
notes that "while saving anyone is a good thing to do, to try to assert
innocence as a key political organizing strategy is to turn a blind eye
to the system and how it works."¹⁰ For Gilmore, the problem "is not to
figure out how to determine or prove the innocence of certain
individuals or certain classes of people, but to attack the general
system through which criminalizationproceeds."¹¹These appeals to
innocence are also anachronistic because they do not address the
transformation and reorganization of racist strategies in the
post--civil rights era. [A [politics of innocence is only capable of
acknowledging examples of direct]{.mark}, individualized [acts of racist
violence while obscuring]{.mark} the racism of a putatively color-blind
liberalism that operates on a [structural level]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Posing the issue in terms of personal prejudice feeds the fallacy of
racism as an individual intention, feeling, or personal prejudice,
though there is certainly a psychological and affective dimension of
racism that exceeds the individual in that it is shaped by social norms
and media representations. The liberal color-blind paradigm of racism
submerges race beneath the "commonsense" logic of crime and
punishment.¹² This effectively conceals racism because it is not
considered racist to be against crime. [Such cases as the execution of
Troy Davis---in which the courts come under scrutiny for racial
bias---also legitimize state violence by treating such cases as
exceptional. The political response to the murder of Troy Davis does not
challenge the assumption that communities need to clean up their streets
by rounding up criminals, for it relies on the claim that Davis is not
one of those feared criminals, but an innocent black man.
[Innocence]{.mark}, however, [is often code for nonthreatening to white
civil society]{.mark}. Troy Davis is differentiated from other black
men---the bad ones---and the legal system is diagnosed as being infected
with racism, masking the fact that the legal system is the constituent
mechanism through which racial violence is carried out (wishful
last-minute appeals to the right to a fair trial reveal this, for they
assume that trials are intended to be fair).]{.underline} The state is
imagined to be deviating from its intended role as protector of the
people rather than being the primary perpetrator. H. Rap Brown provides
a sobering reminder that "Justice means 'just-uswhite-folks.' There is
no redress of grievance for Blacks in this country."¹³ [While there are
countless examples of overt racism, [black social]{.mark} (and physical)
[death is primarily achieved via coded discourses of "criminality" and
mediated forms of state violence carried out by an impersonal carceral
apparatu]{.mark}s (a matrix of police, prisons, the legal system,
prosecutors, parole boards, prison guards, probation officers, and so
forth).]{.underline} In other words, incidents where a biased individual
attacks or discriminates against a person of color can be identified as
racism to "conscientious persons," but the racism underlying the
systematic imprisonment of black Americans under the pretense of the War
on Drugs is more difficult to locate and generally remains invisible
because it is spatially confined. When it is visible, it fails to arouse
public sympathy, even among the black leadership. As Loïc Wacquant, a
scholar of the carceral state, asks, "What is the chance that white
Americans will identify with Black convicts when even the Black
leadership has turned its back on them?"¹⁴ The abandonment of black
convicts by civil rights organizations is reflected in the history of
these organizations. From 1975 to 1986, the NAACP and the Urban League
identified imprisonment as a central issue, and the disproportionate
incarceration of black Americans was understood as a problem that was
structural and political. Spokespersons from the civil rights
organizations related imprisonment to the general confinement of black
Americans. Imprisoned black men were, as Wacquant notes, portrayed
inclusively as "brothers, uncles, neighbors, friends."¹⁵ Between 1986
and 1990 there was a dramatic shift in the rhetoric and official policy
of the NAACP and the Urban League that exemplifies the turn to a
politics of innocence. By the early 1990s, the NAACP had dissolved its
prison program and ceased publication of articles about rehabilitation
and post-imprisonment issues. Meanwhile, these organizations began to
embrace the rhetoric of individual responsibility and a tough-on-crime
stance that encouraged blacks to collaborate with police to get drugs
out of their neighborhoods, even going as far as endorsing harsher
sentences for minors and recidivists. Black convicts, initially a part
of the "we" articulated by civil rights groups, became them. Wacquant
writes, "This \[hesitation to advocate for Black convicts\] is further
reinforced by the fact, noted long ago by W. E. B. Du Bois, that the
tenuous position of the black bourgeoisie in the socioracial hierarchy
rests critically on its ability to distance itself from its unruly
lower-class brethren: to offset the symbolic disability of blackness,
middle-class African Americans must forcefully communicate to whites
that they have 'absolutely no sympathy and no known connections with any
black man who has committed a crime.'"¹⁶ When the black leadership and
middle-class blacks differentiate themselves from poorer blacks, they
feed into a notion of black exceptionalism that is used to dismantle
antiracist struggles. This class of exceptional blacks (Barack Obama,
Condoleeza Rice, Colin Powell) supports the image of America as a
post-racial society. The root of this shift in the rhetoric and policy
of civil rights organizations is perhaps a fear of affirming the
conflation of blackness and criminality. However, by not advocating for
prisoners, they shore up and extend the penal state by individualizing,
depoliticizing, and decontextualizing the issue of "crime and
punishment" and vilifying those most likely to be subjected to
racialized state violence. [This [disidentification]{.mark} with poor,
urban black Americans is not limited to black men, but [also affects
black women, who are vilified via the figure of the Welfare
Queen]{.mark}, [portrayed as a lazy, sexually irresponsible burden on
society (]{.mark}particularly hardworking white Americans).]{.underline}
The welfare state and the penal state complement each other, as revealed
by Bill Clinton's 1998 statements denouncing prisoners and ex-prisoners
who receive welfare or Social Security: he condemns former prisoners who
receive welfare assistance, accusing them of deviously committing "fraud
and abuse" against "working families" who "play by the rules."¹⁷
Furthermore, this complementarity is gendered. Black women are the shock
absorbers of the social crisis created by the penal state[: the
[incarceration of black men]{.mark} profoundly [increases the burden put
on black women]{.mark}, who are forced to perform more waged and unwaged
(caring) labor, raise children alone, and who are punished by the state
when their husbands or family members are convicted of crimes (for
example, [a family cannot receive housing assistance if someone in the
household has been convicted of a drug felony]{.mark}).]{.underline} The
reconfiguration of the welfare state under the Clinton administration
(which imposed stricter regulations on welfare recipients) further
intensified the backlash against poor black women. In this view, the
welfare state is the apparatus used to regulate poor black women who are
not subjected to regulation by the penal state that is directed chiefly
at black men---though it is important to note [that the feminization of
poverty and the punitive turn in nonviolent crime policy led to a 400
percent increase in the female prison population]{.underline} between
1980 and the late 1990s.¹⁸Racialized patterns of incarceration and the
assault on the urban poor are not seen as a form of racist state
violence because, in the eyes of the public, convicts (along with their
families and associates) deserve such treatment. [The politics of
innocence directly fosters this culture of vilification, even when it is
used by civil rights organizations.]{.underline}

#### Violence is only recognized when spaces are accessible to the white imaginary, black neighborhoods and prisons are characterized as "alternate universes" were tropes of criminality are a structural assumption

The engineering and management of urban space also demarcates the limits
of our political imagination by determining which narratives and
experiences are even thinkable. [[The media construction of urban
ghettos and prisons as "alternate universes" marks them as zones of
unintelligibility,]{.mark} faraway places removed from the everyday
white experience. [Native American reservations are another example of
"void" zones that white people can only access through the fantasy of
media representations]{.mark}]{.underline}. What happens in these zones
of abjection and vulnerability does not typically register in the white
imaginary. [In the instance that an "injustice" does register, it will
have to be translated into more comprehensible terms]{.underline}.
[[When considering]{.mark} the public responses to [Oscar Grant and
Trayvon Martin]{.mark}, it seems significant that [these murders took
place in spaces that are accessible to the white imaginary]{.mark},
[which allows white people to narrativize the incidents]{.mark} in terms
that are familiar to them. [Martin was gunned down while visiting family
members in a gated neighborhood; Grant was murdered by police officer
Johannes Mehserle at the Fruitvale BART Station in Oakland. These spaces
are not "alternate universes" or void zones that lie outside
middle-class white experience and comprehension]{.mark}.]{.underline} To
what extent is the attention these cases have received attributable to
the encroachment of violence on spaces that white people occupy? How
does the public respond to cases of racialized violence that occur
outside white comfort zones? [When describing the spatialization of
settler colonies, Frantz Fanon writes about "a zone of non-being, an
extraordinary sterile and arid region," where "black is not a man."²⁵ In
the regions where black is not "man," there is no story to be told. Or
rather, there are no subjects seen as worthy of having a story of their
own.]{.underline}

**Blackness is a preconceived notion of danger; whiteness sees violence
rather than resistance and fails to see that its rather the system built
in opposition to black bodies. The 1AC is an embodiment of the negation
of a politics of innocence which departs from enabling white civil
society to purify and morally ennoble itself.**

[The [insistence on innocence results in a refusal to hear those labeled
guilty]{.mark} or defined by the state [as "criminals."]{.mark} [When we
rely on appeals to innocence]{.mark}, [we foreclose a form of resistance
that is outside the limits of law and instead ally ourselves with the
state]{.mark}. This ignores that the "enemies" in the War on Drugs and
the War on Terror are racially defined, and that gender and class
delimit who is worthy of legal recognition. [When the Occupy movement
was in full swing]{.mark}, I read countless articles and encountered
participants who were eager to police the politics and tactics of those
who did not fit into a nonviolent model of resistance.]{.underline} The
tendency was to construct a politics from the position of the
disenfranchised white middle-class and to remove, deny, and
differentiate the Occupy movement from the "delinquent" or radical
elements by condemning property destruction, confrontations with cops,
and---in cases like Baltimore--- anticapitalist and anarchist analyses.
[When [Amy Goodman asked Maria Lewis from Occupy Oakland about the
"violent" protestors]{.mark} after more than four hundred arrests made
during an attempt to occupy the vacant Henry J. Kaiser Convention Center
in Oakland, I was pleased that Lewis affirmed rather than excised
people's anger]{.underline}: AMY GOODMAN: Maria Lewis, what about some
of the reports that said that the protesters were violent? MARIA LEWIS[:
Absolutely[. There was a lot of anger this weekend]{.mark}, and I think
that the anger the protesters showed in the streets this weekend and the
fighting back that did take place was reflective of a larger anger in
Oakland that is boiling over at the betrayal of the system. I think that
[people]{.mark}, day by day, [are realizing]{.mark}, [as the economy
gets worse and worse]{.mark}, as [unemployment gets worse]{.mark} and
worse, as [homelessness gets worse]{.mark} and worse, that the economic
system, that capitalism in Oakland, is failing us]{.underline}. And
people are really angry about that, and they're beginning to fight back.
And I think that's a really inspiring thing.⁵⁷ Although the comment
still frames the issue in terms of capitalist crisis, the response
skillfully rearticulates the terms of the discussion by [a) [affirming
the actions immediately]{.mark}, b) [refusing to purify the
movement]{.mark} by integrating rather than excluding the "violent"⁵⁸
elements, c) [legitimizing the anger and desires]{.mark} of the
protestors, and d) [shifting the attention to the structural nature of
the problem rather than making moral judgments about individual
actors]{.mark}.]{.underline} In other words, [it rejects a politics of
innocence that reproduces the "good," compliant citizen.]{.underline}
Stokely Carmichael put it well when he said, ["The way the oppressor
tries to stop the oppressed from using violence as a means to attain
liberation is to raise ethical or moral questions about violence. I want
to state emphatically here that violence in any society is neither moral
nor is it ethical. It is neither right, nor is it wrong. It is just
simply a question of who has the power to legalize
violence."⁵⁹]{.underline} The practice of isolating morally agreeable
cases in order to highlight racist violence requires passively suffered
black death and panders to a framework that strengthens and conceals
current paradigms of racism. Although it may be factually true to state
that Trayvon Martin was unarmed, we should not state this with a
righteous sense of satisfaction. What if Martin were armed? What if he
was able to defend himself? Had the situation resulted in the death of
George Zimmerman rather than of Martin, it is unlikely that the public
would have been as outraged and galvanized into action to the same
extent. Prior to Zimmerman's acquittal, many people on the left had
faith that there would be "justice for Trayvon," as though prison time
for Zimmerman could somehow compensate for Martin's death. When we build
politics around standards of legitimate victimhood that require passive
sacrifice, we will build a politics that requires a dead black boy to
make its point. It's not surprising that the nation or even the black
leadership have failed to rally behind CeCe McDonald, [a [black trans
woman]{.mark} who [was convicted of second-degree manslaughter after a
group of racist, transphobic white people attacked her]{.mark} and her
friends, cutting McDonald's [cheek with a glass bottle]{.mark} and
provoking an altercation that [led to the death of a white man who had a
swastika tattoo]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Trans women of color]{.mark} who
are involved in confrontations that result in the death of their
attackers [are criminalized for their survival.]{.mark} When [Akira
Jackson]{.mark}, a black trans woman, [stabbed and killed her boyfriend
after he beat her]{.mark} with a baseball bat, she [was given a
four-year sentence]{.mark} for manslaughter. [Cases that involve an
"innocent" (passive), victimized black person also provide an
opportunity for the liberal white conscience to purify and morally
ennoble itself by taking a position against racism]{.mark}. [We need to
challenge the use of certain raced and gendered subjects as instruments
of emotional relief for white civil society]{.mark}, or as bodies that
can be displaced for the sake of providing analogies to amplify white
suffering ("slavery" being the favored analogy).]{.underline} Although
we must emphasize that Troy Davis did not kill police officer Mark
MacPhail, [maybe we also should question [why the public is morally
outraged by the killing of a cop and not the 136 unarmed black Americans
murdered by police officers, security guards, and self-appointed
vigilantes in 2012]{.mark} alone]{.underline}. Talking about these
murders will not undo them. Having the "right line" cannot alter reality
if we do not put our bodies where our mouths are. As Spivak says, "it
can't become our goal to keep watching our language."⁶⁰[[Rejecting the
politics of innocence is not about assuming a certain theoretical
posture or adopting a certain perspective---it is a lived
position]{.underline}]{.mark}.

##  Policing and Militarization

[The issues of [**police militarization** and the]{.mark}
disproportionate [use of force against]{.mark} historically
[**disadvantaged racial groups** are inextricably]{.mark}
[**linked**.]{.mark} The goal here is to provide insight into the
origins of **domestic police militarization**. To do so, we build on our
previous work to discuss how proactive [U]{.mark}.S. foreign policy
generates **undesirable domestic consequences**, which threaten the
liberties and **freedoms** of U.S. citizens.]{.underline} In the context
of police militarization, [[past foreign military interventions **led
directly to the militarization of U.S. police**. The]{.mark}
undesirable]{.underline} [[consequences have fallen **disproportionately
on minorities**]{.underline}]{.mark} and disadvantaged groups. [The main
takeaway is that a proactive, imperialistic foreign policy can impose
significant costs on domestic citizens due to expansions in the scope of
state power]{.underline}. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams are
police units possessing highly specialized military equipment and
training. These groups have become a fixture in many police departments
in the United States. In the mid-1980s, approximately 20 percent of
police departments had a SWAT team. By the year 2000, nearly 90 percent
of police departments serving populations of 50,000 or more had a SWAT
team. An estimated 3,000 SWAT deployments occurred in 1980. By the early
2000s, SWAT teams deployed 45,000 times every year. Current estimates
place the number of SWAT deployments as high as 80,000 annually.
Although now common, [[SWAT teams are a relatively new
innovation]{.mark}, one [that can be directly **tied to U.S. foreign
intervention**]{.mark}]{.underline} and to two combat veterans, former
Los Angeles police chief and World War II veteran Daryl Gates and former
Los Angeles police officer and Marine John Nelson. As a Marine, Nelson
served in Vietnam in an elite Force Recon unit. Although originally
designed to gather intelligence, these Force Recon teams saw extended
combat and were recognized for their use of lethal force. They became
well known for being experts at skillfully eliminating enemy targets.
For example, the \"kill ratio,\" or number of enemies killed per every
soldier lost, was about 7.6 enemies per Marine for regular Marine
infantries during the Vietnam War. The kill ratio for the Force Recon
units, meanwhile, was about 34 enemies for every man lost in action. The
Force Recon units were also more aggressive. Regular Marine units were
the aggressors in combat only 20 percent of the time they saw action.
The Force Recon teams, in contrast, were the aggressors in an astounding
95 percent of their operations. Stated differently, the Force Recon
units were trained to gather information, engage enemy combatants, and
kill. They did so efficiently. These experiences were integral in
developing John Nelson\'s skills, knowledge, and abilities regarding
methods for controlling large groups, gathering information, and
eliminating enemies. He brought this unique human capital with him when
he returned to the United States and joined the Los Angeles Police
Department (LAPD). In the 1960s, Nelson was presented an opportunity to
use the unique skills of social control that he had developed abroad. In
1965, racial tensions set off the Watts riots in Los Angeles. The riots
left the LAPD feeling unprepared. In response to the perceived crisis
surrounding the riots, leaders of the LAPD were anxious to develop new
ways to effectively control the large crowds regularly in attendance at
race rallies. Drawing from his experiences with the Force Recon team,
Nelson suggested the development of a similar unit within the LAPD. \"A
small squad of highly trained police officers armed with special
weapons,\" he suggested, \"would be more effective in a riotous
situation than a massive police response.\" To take effect, however,
Nelson\'s idea would need administrative support. It was here that
Inspector (later Police Chief) Daryl Gates was essential. Like Nelson,
Gates was a veteran of foreign conflict, serving aboard the USS Ault
during World War II. And like Nelson, Gates returned home from war with
a unique skill set and had joined the LAPD. By the time Nelson proposed
his idea, individuals like Gates had successfully worked their way into
the administration of the LAPD. The presence of war veterans created an
administrative and cultural openness to the use of military tactics. In
fact, Gates himself wanted the LAPD be more militaristic and
\"aggressive, intimidating, and confrontational by design.\" It was
within this environment that Nelson proposed the idea of a Force Recon
style unit within the LAPD. With Gates\' support, Nelson\'s idea was
quickly adopted. The link between the newly formed paramilitary unit and
the ongoing war in Vietnam was readily apparent. Initially called the
\"Special Weapons and Attack Team,\" it was decided that the word
\"attack\" was politically unpalatable. Gates subsequently changed the
name to \"Special Weapons and Tactics\" and the first SWAT team was
born. The first SWAT unit consisted of 60 of the LAPD\'s top marksmen
divided into teams consisting of five men---a leader, marksman,
observer, scout, and a rearguard. The men selected for the first SWAT
team further illustrate how the skills developed in foreign intervention
influenced domestic police operations. According to the LAPD, each
member of the original SWAT unit had specialized experience and prior
military service. Moreover, the new SWAT team continued to incorporate
new military tactics in counterinsurgency and guerrilla warfare, hiring
military personnel to teach the SWAT unit. The use of SWAT teams
throughout the country expanded rapidly as a result of [[the War on
Drugs and War on Terror.]{.mark}]{.underline} As we have written
previously, these conflicts [[served as **catalysts** to spread
police]{.mark} [militarization as **local police departments** became
intertwined with the federal government\'s efforts to combat drugs and
terror.]{.mark}]{.underline} This relationship between the political
periphery (state and local governments) and the political center (the
national government) allowed for the expansion of SWAT operations
through the transfer of military-grade equipment and training. For
example, the DOD 1208 Program, implemented in 1990, allowed the
Department of Defense to transfer military equipment, such as aircraft,
armor, watercraft, and weapons, to state and local police to use in
their efforts to combat drugs. In 2013, a successor
program, [**Program** [**1033**, transferred]{.mark} almost [\$500
million in military]{.mark} [weapons]{.mark} and gear [to domestic law
enforcement agencies for]{.mark} the purposes of [**fighting drugs and
terror**. The **influx of military equipment** into]{.mark} [local law
enforcement, combined with the **adoption of military tactics** like
those employed by SWAT teams, created an arena in which]{.mark} the
liberties and [freedoms]{.mark} of U.S. citizens [were
**jeopardized**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Those most likely to
suffer]{.mark} from these changes [were those least likely to have
the]{.mark} [means to **avoid** the enhanced coercive power of the
state---the poor]{.mark}, politically unconnected, [and]{.mark}
historically **[marginalized]{.mark}** groups.]{.underline} Just as
racial minorities are more likely to die while in police custody, so too
are SWAT teams more likely to be used against minority groups. According
to a recent report by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), SWAT
raids primarily impact persons of color. Between 2011 and 2012,
approximately 50 percent of all SWAT raids were conducted against Black
or Hispanic individuals while only 20 percent of raids involved white
suspects. The difference is more pronounced when looking at particular
types of SWAT raids. For example, some 68 percent of drug raids studied
by the ACLU were conducted against minority suspects compared to a much
lower rate for whites, even though rates of drug use and selling are
similar across racial groups. In some localities, Blacks and Latinos are
much more likely to be impacted by SWAT raids than their white
counterparts. In Allentown, Pennsylvania, for example, Latinos are 29
times more likely to be affected by a SWAT raid than whites, while
Blacks are 23 times more likely. Blacks are 37 times more likely to be
the victim of a SWAT raid in Huntington, West Virginia, than their white
counterparts. Blacks in Ogden, Utah, are 39 times more likely to be
subjected to a SWAT raid and Blacks in Burlington, North Carolina, are
47 times more likely as compared to whites. [The question remains why
such groups are more likely to be disproportionally affected by police
militarization. Albert Hirschman offers one explanation. He argues
that [individuals are faced with **two options** when they confront
problems within]{.mark} organizations to which they belong, including
[governments]{.mark}. First, [individuals may \"**exit,\"**]{.mark} **or
withdraw** from [the relationship.]{.mark} Alternatively, [they can
\"**voice\" their grievances** in an attempt to address and **repair**
the problem. For those groups most]{.mark} likely to be adversely
[affected by police militarization]{.mark}, however, [both of these
options may be]{.mark} weak or altogether [nonexistent]{.mark} for a
variety of reasons. For many, **[exiting]{.mark} a community** where
police militarization is prevalent [may be]{.mark} [**unviable** due to
financial constraints.]{.mark} Consider that [Hispanics are]{.mark} more
than [**twice** as likely, and Blacks almost **three times** more
likely, to live]{.mark} [in deep poverty as whites.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Given these circumstances, [the option to exit is not feasible for many.
As a result, these individuals become **even more** **vulnerable** to
state tools of social control.]{.underline} There is reason to believe
that the \"voice\" mechanism is also weak for racial minorities. [[One
study]{.underline}]{.mark}, for instance, [[found]{.mark}
[that **increased racial segregation leads to a decrease in black civic
efficacy**]{.mark}. The authors note that relatively [segregated black
communities are]{.mark} often [represented by politicians who **fail to
vote** for policies favored by black constituents. Ferguson illustrates
this]{.mark} concept well. [While 67 percent of residents are black,
there are nearly **no Black political figures**.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Taken together, the lack of voice and exit opportunities means that
[minority groups are often the least able to avoid the **adverse costs**
and consequences of militarized police forces. [**Foreign and domestic
policies** are]{.mark} often [seen as]{.mark} distinct and [separate. In
reality]{.mark}, however, [a]{.mark} proactive [foreign
policy]{.mark} (i.e., [military intervention) generates **unseen
domestic** costs, including the importation of techniques, methods, and
tools of **state-produced social control**.]{.mark} The militarization
of domestic policing is one illustration of how innovations in social
control developed through foreign interventions can **boomerang back to
the homeland**.]{.underline} When these innovations return home they
lower the cost for the political elite of exerting control over the
domestic populace. [The costs of these expanded powers often fall
disproportionally on those least able to move or effectively voice their
dissatisfaction with government behaviors. [What can be]{.mark}
[done? Changing the status quo requires a **fundamental
reconsideration** of the]{.mark} scope and scale of [government by U.S.
citizens. Instead of]{.mark} [remaining **passive**]{.mark} regarding
the role of the state in their daily lives, [citizens must become
**skeptical** regarding]{.mark} the net benefits of the projection of
[state power, both **domestically and abroad**.]{.mark} This is
especially important for minority and marginalized groups who are least
able to avoid the abusive hand of the state. Unfortunately, many U.S.
citizens currently view the state as a solution to their problems when
in fact it is a contributing cause to many economic, political, and
social ills.]{.underline}

#### Surplus arms sales from the US creates an endless flow of militarization in the world.

**ICRC '99**
(https://www.icrc.org/en/doc/resources/documents/publication/p0734.html
Established in 1863, the ICRC operates worldwide, helping people
affected by conflict and armed violence and promoting the laws that
protect victims of war. An independent and neutral organization, its
mandate stems essentially from the Geneva Conventions of 1949. We are
based in Geneva, Switzerland, and employ some 16,000 people in more than
80 countries. The ICRC is funded mainly by voluntary donations from
governments and from National Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies.//Dewayne Martin)

The **[Cold War competition between two strategic alliances, in which
arms were made available primarily for global political and strategic
purposes, has largely disappeared.]{.underline}** Major weapons
transfers by the principal exporting States are now often motivated
primarily by economic and employment benefits. Military, strategic and
political factors have become secondary considerations in many instances
and are sometimes completely ignored. The human costs of arms transfers
have, until recently, been considered of little importance. **[A major
impetus driving arms sales to developing States has been the rapidly
shrinking military budgets of northern industrialized
countries.]{.underline}** The lack of coherent policies for conversion
of military production capacities to serve the civilian economy has
meant that military industries with high production capabilities
generated by the Cold War are competing intensively to develop new
markets, particularly in the developing world. Even the former
Czechoslovakia, which made a political decision in the early 1990s to
cease arms exports, subsequently chose to re-enter the business for
economic and other reasons. In addition, large quantities of surplus
weapons have been transferred from the northern hemisphere to developing
countries in the form of direct aid, subsidized sales or intra-alliance
transfers. Ironically**[, [these surplus arms are the by-product not
only of reduced military budgets and forces in the industrialized
countries but also of successful arms control agreements that have
required members of NATO and the former Warsaw Pact to eliminate
hundreds of thousands of weapons from their
inventories.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[This **flow of surplus arms is not
likely to end soon -- unless preventive action is taken without
delay.**]{.mark}]{.underline} In the coming five to ten years a new wave
of surplus weapons and ammunition into developing countries can be
expected to result from the need for funds in some States of the former
Soviet Union and the modernization of arsenals in countries slated to
join NATO or those aspiring to do so. Large-scale arms transfers can be
a source of tension in peacetime and generate high levels of casualties
once hostilities begin. Massive arms exports to Iraq throughout the
1980s are seen by many observers as having emboldened Iraq's incursion
into Kuwait and as justifying the allied response in the second Gulf War
(1990-1991).

the world by **force**. "U.S.]{.mark} Special Forces [troops now operate
in]{.mark} more than [a **dozen** African nations."]{.mark}]{.underline}
Marking exactly 10 years after the establishment of AFRICOM, short for
U.S. Africa Command, the Black Alliance for Peace (BAP) has launched
"U.S. Out of Africa!: Shut Down AFRICOM," a campaign designed to end the
U.S. invasion and occupation of Africa. [Although U.S. leaders say
AFRICOM is "**fighting terrorism**" on the continent [in reality AFRICOM
is a dangerous structure that has only **increased militarism**.
The]{.mark} real [reason for its]{.mark} [existence is geopolitical
**competition with China**. When AFRICOM was
established]{.mark}]{.underline} in the months before Barack Obama
assumed office as the first Black President of the United States, [a
majority of [African nations]{.mark}]{.underline}---led by the
Pan-Africanist government of Libya---[[**rejected** AFRICOM]{.mark},
forcing the new command to instead work out of Europe. [But with the
U.S.]{.mark} and NATO **[attack on Libya]{.mark}** that led to the
**destruction** of that country]{.underline} and the murder of its
leader, Muammar Gaddafi, [[in 2011]{.mark}, corrupt [African leaders
began to **allow** AFRICOM forces to operate in their countries]{.mark}
and establish military-to-military relations with the United States.
Today, those efforts have resulted in **46** various forms of **U.S.
bases** as well as military-to-military relations between 53 out of the
54 African countries]{.underline} and the United States. U.S. Special
Forces troops now operate in more than a dozen African nations. "The
real reason for AFRICOM's existence is geopolitical competition with
China." Vice Admiral Robert Moeller, the head of AFRICOM, declared in
2008 , "[[Protecting the]{.mark} free [flow of natural resources from
Africa to the **global market** is]{.mark} one of [Africom's **guiding
principle**]{.mark}s."]{.underline} AFRICOM is the flip side of the
domestic war being waged by the same repressive state structure against
Black and poor people in the United States. [[The Black power]{.mark}
and civil rights [movement]{.mark} of the 60s and 70s [was met with the
**repressive** response of the FBI]{.mark} in the form of its COINTELPRO
or Counter Intelligence Program that effectively **obliterated** these
movements for social justice and
self-determination[.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[While in]{.mark} the very
same era on the continent of [Africa, the CIA conspired with other
**colonizing** powers to do the **exact same things**, exemplified by
the overthrow of Kwame Nkrumah in Ghana the and]{.mark} the
assassination of [Patrice Lumumba in the Congo.]{.mark}]{.underline}
BAP's U.S. Out of Africa!: Shut Down AFRICOM campaign links the
resistance to the domestic war on Black people to U.S. interventionism
and militarism abroad. [Not only does there need to be a **mass
movement** in the U.S. to shut down AFRICOM, this mass movement needs to
become inseparably bound with the movement that has swept this country
to end murderous police brutality against Black and Brown people. [The
whole world must begin to see AFRICOM and the **militarization** of U.S.
**domestic police** departments as counterparts.]{.mark}]{.underline}

JACQUELINE LUQMAN: This is Jacqueline Luqman with The Real News. We
talked in the first segment about Black Alliance for Peace, an
organization that is two years old that has a mission and a focus on
reviving the black radical antiwar tradition and focus in the United
States. We talked [in the first segment about NATO, [the **far reach**
of U.S. militarism]{.mark}, and specifically what the United States
military is doing in Africa, that many people in America know little to
nothing about. But in this segment, we're going to talk about [what all
this means to black people
**domestically**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} To continue this
conversation, I am here joined today by Netfa Freeman; Netfa is the
Coordinating Committee member for the Black Alliance for Peace (BAP),
he's also an organizer with Pan-African Community Action (PCA), and
Vanessa Beck. Vanessa is a member of the Black Alliance for Peace
Research Committee and is also on the Steering Committee for Health Over
Profit for Everyone (HOPE). Thank you both for joining me again for this
second segment. VANESSA BECK: Thank you, Jacqueline. NETFA FREEMAN:
Thank you. JACQUELINE LUQMAN: So we--you guys gave us a lot of
information, a lot of very disturbing information; [[800 U.S. military
bases around the world, the **expanded** role of the United States
military in Africa that few people know about]{.mark}, and NATO--the
role of NATO]{.underline}. Let me ask you a question about NATO before
we go into the domestic focus of the black radical antiwar sentiment
that needs to be revived. When people think about NATO, they usually
think about the expansion of NATO in regard to the response of Russia to
NATO. Do you think, Netfa, that that overshadows what's being done in
Africa in regard to NATO? NETFA FREEMAN: Yeah, it definitely
overshadows. I mean, there's nothing--[I think that particularly our
[people need to understand what our]{.mark} political, economic, and
social [**interests** are. Russia is not our **enemy**]{.mark}, that's
not what's happening. [They're killing us in the street every **28
hours**, they're not the ones **mass incarcerating** us, they're not the
ones with a big footprint on the African continent. That's the
**U**]{.mark}**nited [S]{.mark}tates**]{.underline} with a big military
footprint on the African continent. I don't even know if [Russia has--at
most, they might have **one** **base** there]{.underline}. And really,
what the interests are in terms of--it was strange, because they also
talk about China a lot. And China is very, very present on the African
continent in a lot of ways. Still, though, it's not a military
footprint. [It's in trade agreements and relationships that people could
argue are for the interests of [China]{.mark}, but still, that's what
every country, every government and people do. But [they're not bringing
militarism, they don't]{.mark} have the same history of
**[overthrow]{.mark}ing** **[governments]{.mark}** and CIA coup d'etats.
[This is the legacy of the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}. And so, when they talk about that in the
media and people end up focusing on it, we are not really focusing on
things that are in our best interest or help us understand that at all.
[[We don't understand the legacy]{.mark} and the nature [of
**colonialism**]{.mark}, not only that it applies to a new
colonialism,]{.underline} all the trappings of independence but with all
of the same political and economic relationships and interests and power
relations intact, that's known as neocolonialism. [And [it exists
on]{.mark} the continent of [Africa and]{.mark} also applies to us as
black people [in the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates.]{.underline}
JACQUELINE LUQMAN: So that's a great segue into what I'm going to ask
you, Vanessa. [Why should black people--why should anyone in the United
States care about all of this information you've just given us about the
**expansion** of the United States military state?]{.underline} But why
should black people care in particular, especially black people in the
United States? [Why should black people in Baltimore be concerned about
what the United States military is doing in Africa?]{.underline} VANESSA
BECK: Right. Very, very important question. So [while the United States
military was ramping up **militarization in Africa**,
[**simultaneously** the Obama administration was ramping up
**militarization right here**, of colonized black and poor working class
**neighborhoods** in the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}. And [[this involves]{.mark} even
[using]{.mark} some of [the]{.mark} very **[same weapons]{.mark}** and
the very same tactics and techniques [to]{.mark}]{.underline} kind of
[[squash any]{.mark} kind of [uprisings]{.mark} that occur]{.underline}.
One thing I like to look at is life expectancy, like let's take the
Upton, Druid Hills neighborhood in Baltimore and compare that to life
expectancy in the wealthy white Roland Park. And Roland Park, if you're
lucky enough to be living there, your life expectancy is 84, whereas in
Upton, it is 68. And that is on par with nations that the United States
occupies and bombs. It's more on par with that than it is the rest of
the United States. JACQUELINE LUQMAN: So we don't have a situation in
Druid Hill where the United States is dropping bombs on the
neighborhood, right, there's no one drone bombing Druid Hill. So how is
American militarism abroad affecting the life expectancy of people in
poor, and especially poor black neighborhoods? Where is the connection?
VANESSA BECK: Well, [[militarization]{.mark} is not only about dropping
bombs, it [is]{.mark} also [the threat of having]{.mark} [militarized
police and **surveillance** in a community]{.mark}]{.underline}. There
are two programs, domestically in particular, that are responsible for
this occupied--I was going to say occupied feeling, but it's a reality,
occupied reality in our neighborhoods. [There's [the 1033
Program]{.mark} which [allows]{.mark} any kind of local [police to
obtain **military weapons**]{.mark} from the pentagon at reduced rates
or [for **free**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And this even applies to school
districts, and [campus police can get these weapons]{.underline}. And
then we also have what has been named the Deadly Exchange Program, which
is a police exchange between U.S. police and Israeli police, where they
trade tactics and techniques. Now, the Israeli police is known to be one
of the most violent occupying police forces that there is, and Israeli
police, meanwhile, [recognize that [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[police are a **terrorizing** force on black people]{.mark}
domestically. So there's this **intensification of militarization** that
we particularly see when black people are uprising here over shootings
or over conditions in their neighborhoods. Then it is very much out in
the open. But this affects us, just the daily stress of living under
these conditions affects our **health**, even.]{.underline}

Behavior. What About Washington's?", 21 December 2018,

\\\\EG

John Bolton's recent unveiling of [[the]{.mark} Trump Administration's
["**Prosper Africa**" plan]{.mark}]{.underline} did what is typical of
such U.S. foreign policy announcements. It [[performed]{.mark} the
balancing act of [admitting motives to protect **vague** "U.S.
interests" while]{.mark} **dishonestly [claiming benevolent]{.mark}**
[intentions]{.mark} for the other country]{.underline}, region, or
continent concerned. In this case the continent is Africa. The "new"
Africa policy, National Security Advisor Bolton suggested, is an
adjusted U.S. strategy to "assist" African economic independence from
the predatory designs of China and Russia. [In reality [it is the
Trump's]{.mark} administration taking the [baton]{.mark} from the Obama
administration [in the new **Scramble for**]{.mark} [**Africa**, a
sequel to the proliferation of]{.mark} conflicting [European claims to
African territory]{.mark} during the New **Imperialism**
period]{.underline}, between the 1880s and the start of World War I.
Bolton admits as much when he calls the administration's new plan a
response to "predatory practices pursued by China and Russia \[that\]
stunt economic growth in Africa; threaten the financial independence of
African nations; inhibit opportunities for U.S. investment; interfere
with U.S. military operations; and pose a significant threat to U.S.
national security interests." He divulged this and the "new" U.S.-Africa
policy in a speech he gave at the far-right Heritage Foundation. [It
should be obvious that Bolton cares little about **predation** --- [he
just doesn't want other predators to compete with.]{.mark}]{.underline}
He made no mention of the U.S. Africa Command
([[AFRICOM]{.underline}]{.mark}), which [[has put most African nations
under]{.mark} the effective military [control of the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates. [AFRICOM is the **re-colonization of Africa** by the
U.S., with thousands of U.S. troops now stationed in]{.mark} some 30
[Africa]{.mark}n countries and dozens of U.S. bases across
Africa.]{.underline} The total estimated cost for AFRICOM in 2018 is
\$236.9 million. Another quarter-billion dollars over the next six years
is projected to be spent to build a U.S. military drone base in Niger,
West Africa. Bolton's claims of having humanitarian concerns for Africa
--- or for anyone --- ring hollow when U.S.-Africa policy is predicated
on spreading these instruments of death (while domestic budgets for
health care, education, and necessary social services in the U.S. are
considered expendable). No mistake should be made in thinking that
foreign policy toward Africa is a partisan issue. Its essence is
consistently the same. [Obama, the first Black president, paved the way
for the **proliferation** of AFRICOM on the continent. During his terms
there was a **1,900 percent increase** in the U.S. military presence on
the continent]{.underline}. African independence movements since the
1950s have been destabilized by U.S. administrations of both parties.
[[Leaders such as]{.mark} Patrice [Lumumba]{.mark} of Congo,
[assassinated by the CIA, and]{.mark} Kwame [Nkrumah]{.mark} of Ghana,
who was [overthrown in a CIA]{.mark} orchestrated [coup, **fell victim
to U.S.**]{.mark}]{.underline} government meddling. With this history,
the United States lags behind China in Africa, which is investing in
African infrastructure and forgiving debt demanded by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF). If China and now Russia are increasing their
influence in Africa, it's because Africans see advantages to having an
alternative to Washington --- and they have every right to do business
with, or ally themselves, with the states of their choosing. Regardless
of the motivations of China, Russia, or any other non-Western nations,
for African countries to have an alternative to U.S.- and Western
European-dominated institutions for investment can only be a good thing
for Africa. The record of institutions like the World Bank and IMF has
been to impose economic structural adjustments that increase profits for
Western multinational corporations but spiral African people into
poverty. Then there's the Pentagon. Long-standing U.S. military aid to,
and close joint operations with, Rwanda and Uganda led proxies of these
countries into the Congo, contributing to a conflict that resulted in
the deaths of 6 million people between 1998 and 2007. [More recently,
thousands of Ghanaians **rallied** in the streets of their capital this
spring to protest a deal that would give the United States military an
expanded role in Ghana. And this month, [an AFRICOM press]{.mark}
release **[boasted]{.mark}** its [success in killing 62 people in
Somalia]{.mark} by four "precision airstrikes."]{.underline} About these
things, Bolton seems unconcerned. If anything, Bolton seems to gripe
that the U.S. has been too helpful to Africans in the recent past.
Bolton says what distinguishes Prosper Africa from the plan of the
previous administration is that "The United States will no longer
provide indiscriminate assistance across the entire continent, without
focus or prioritization. And, we will no longer support unproductive,
unsuccessful, and unaccountable UN peacekeeping missions." This part is
consistent with Bolton's notorious disdain of the United Nations and
with Donald Trump's "America First" doctrine. This might be about the
only substantial difference between his Africa policy and that of the
previous administration. It basically means [[the administration]{.mark}
just [intends to **advance** **U.S. hegemony**]{.mark} using less
cooperation with other global powers. [Federal spending]{.mark} that
**militarizes** other parts of the world [might secure access to]{.mark}
corporations [robbing Africa of its]{.mark} rich mineral
[resources]{.mark}, [and **enrich** military
contractors]{.mark}]{.underline}, but it does little to nothing that
benefits common U.S. citizens or the struggling people of Africa. What
can average citizens do? One way to end the madness is to support the
Black Alliance for Peace (BAP) campaign that calls for an end to AFRICOM
and to all foreign interference in the affairs of African nations. BAP's
petition calls upon the U.S. Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) to hold
hearings on the impact of U.S. militarization in Africa. A mass movement
is needed to expose the real bipartisan U.S. foreign policy in Africa.
The campaign to "shut down AFRICOM" is part and parcel of a peace
movement to demilitarize the U.S. and the world. This objective is a
requirement of any legitimate and genuine peace movement.

#### AFRICOM is a mechanism of [white supremacy]{.underline} to legitimize African conflict and justify the [siege]{.underline} of Black communities.

Members of a [[Black]{.underline}]{.mark} anti-imperialist collective
say [[people]{.underline}]{.mark} of African descent [[have been
**misinformed** about the true nature of]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates']{.underline} seemingly benevolent [[military
presence]{.mark} in the motherland]{.underline}, currently manifested
[[through U.S. Africa Command]{.underline}]{.mark}. As the unified
combatant command, known as AFRICOM, enters its 11th year of existence,
the Black Alliance for Peace (BAP), a group comprised of grass-roots
Black leftist organizations, has launched a campaign to dismantle what
has been likened to the militaristic policing tactics used in Black
communities throughout the United States. "The parallels are clear. They
treat us like the same people," said Netfa Freeman, an affiliate of the
Institute for Policy Studies in Northwest and member of Pan-African
Community Action (PACA), a BAP partner organization. According to its
website, AFRICOM works with interagency and international partners to
advance the United States' policy goals on the African continent by
building defense capabilities and defeating perceived threats to global
security. But AFRICOM's opponents say the intentions are more nefarious.
On Oct. 1, the 10th anniversary of AFRICOM's official launch, [BAP
announced its "U.S. Out of Africa!: Shut Down AFRICOM" **campaign**, an
effort to combat the U.S. military presence in the
continent.]{.underline} Change.org petitions in English, Spanish,
French, German and Arabic, to be delivered to the U.S. House Armed
Services Committee and Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), demand the
complete withdrawal of U.S. military forces from Africa and the closure
of U.S. military bases worldwide. [The petition]{.underline} also calls
for CBC opposition to AFRICOM and its commitment to holding hearings
about the military program's impact on the African continent. In the
weeks leading up to the campaign, Freeman and other [[BAP members took
to]{.underline}]{.mark} Freeman's weekly 89.3 (WPFW-FM) radio show
"Voices With Vision," [[drawing parallels between]{.mark} the [U.S.
military presence in Africa and **policing** tactics that keep
Black]{.mark} [communities across the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[under **siege**.]{.mark} "There are national security study
[memorandums]{.mark} that [authorize]{.mark}d [the sale of]{.mark} small
[guns to]{.mark} [Africa for]{.mark}]{.underline} what experts called
[[assisted genocide]{.mark},"]{.underline} Freeman told The Informer.
Freeman said **[[AFRICOM]{.underline}]{.mark}** and U.S. Africa Central
Command, a similar program that oversees Egypt, [[fulfills]{.mark} the
[U.S.]{.mark} government's true [intentions of controlling the **flow**
of]{.mark} natural [resources in Africa]{.mark} and the growing Chinese
presence,]{.underline} primarily [[by leveraging]{.mark} [relationships
with African leaders and inciting conflicts that **legitimize**]{.mark}
the [U.S. military presence.]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}["The same
thing happens here,"]{.underline} he said. "[We see weapons we can't
**manufacture** coming in \[our communities\], and [a lot

**armed**. That's the excuse]{.mark} they use [to further
**militarize**]{.mark} spaces \[here and in [Africa\] under the
**guise** of keeping it under control."]{.mark}]{.underline} The Bush
White House announced the launch of AFRICOM in 2007, dubbing it a means
of strengthening cooperation with African countries and promoting common
goals of improved health, education, democracy and economic growth on
the continent. The program expanded under the Obama administration.
[During his 2009 visit to Ghana, President Barack Obama framed U.S.
military activity in Africa as a matter of maintaining global
security.]{.underline} For years, AFRICOM has been headquartered at
Kelley Barracks in Stuttgart, Germany, mostly due to the staunch
opposition of then-Libyan President Muammar Gaddafi, a vocal proponent
of African economic self-determination, and other political leaders in
Nigeria and South Africa. The 2011 U.S. and NATO-led invasion of Libya,
during which Gaddafi was killed, paved the way for AFRICOM's expansion.
Ethiopia and Liberia counted among the African nations that welcomed the
possibility of hosting AFRICOM operations. [This year, nearly \$264
million had been **expected** to fund AFRICOM-related operations in 53
of Africa's 54 nations]{.underline}, according to estimates for the 2018
Operation and Maintenance Overview Fiscal Budget filed in 2017. [Such
allocations have financed intricate military operations throughout the
continent.]{.underline} Last month, in coordination with the Somalian
government, U.S. troops led the killing of 18 members of al-Shabaab,
which officials have labeled an Islamist terrorist organization, in
Somalia. Last week, on the day after AFRICOM's anniversary, an airstrike
killed nine more members of that group. "Many of our people think the
military is needed and troops are protecting our people," said Jaribu
Hill of the Black Agenda Report, a progressive online news network. "We
have to educate people about the politics of war and the damage it
does." Hill outlined an organizing strategy that allows BAP members to
directly connect with people in Black communities through home visits
and town hall meetings. For Hill, a human rights attorney, rallying
support for the campaign requires leaving behind the comforts of social
media and educating the ill-informed, whom she described as victims of
an anti-African, Jim Crow education system. She said face-to-face
interaction with Black people in communities affected by police violence
debunks misconceptions about Africa, learned through media propaganda
that aligns people's interests with the military industrial complex and
precludes them from identifying with the struggles of their counterparts
across the Atlantic Ocean. [["\[U.S. military occupation\] has nothing
to do with the]{.mark} security and health and [wellness of people
living in this country]{.mark} [and other countries]{.mark}," Hill said.
"[It has to do with white **supremacy and domination**. We have to
**break down** those terms. It would be necessary to have]{.mark}
regular, [everyday conversations with]{.mark} our [people to increase
their]{.mark} whole [understanding of the military industrial
complex]{.mark}]{.underline}." Since the campaign started, nearly 500
people have signed the online petition. Organizers said they want to
meet their goal of 10,000 signatures by January 2019. BAP members, part
of a collective that also includes Friends of the Congo, a
Northwest-based advocacy organization, admitted the high likelihood of
the CBC, comprised of nearly 50 Black U.S. lawmakers, ignoring the call
to dismantle AFRICOM and challenge U.S. imperialism. In June, the U.S.
military budget inched closer to \$1 trillion with CBC members'
approval. While not solely responsible, CBC members have also been on
record as throwing their support behind the continuation of the 1033
program, a drug war-era relic under which the Department of Defense has
issued excess military equipment to local police forces, used in
Ferguson, Missouri, Baltimore and other majority-Black communities. In
2014, only seven of 41 CBC members voted for an amendment that would
halt the 1033 program. "If we don't get the CBC on our side, we continue
our radical revolutionary work and taking on these issues," Hill said.
"[We're in solidarity with people in other countries and who are victims
of **imperialism** and the military industrial complex."]{.underline}
Hill said Black congressional representatives will be given a chance to
stray from a narrative that has made them opponents of the Black radical
left. "We know the CBC can't be relied upon," she said. "We have never
had the full support of the Black caucus. They were not there on the
issue of reparations, the prison industrial complex, and police
brutality. They have been virtually silent; it's been a long time since
they decried the murders of our people."

[[Africa policies \[of the U.S.\] have **consistently** remained]{.mark}
**destabilizing and [predatory]{.mark}** over the decades]{.underline},
despite the well-choreographed pretenses. It is [[this]{.mark}
**[imperialism]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [[has
impeded]{.underline}]{.mark} the capacity of [[African
nations]{.underline}]{.mark} to direct their future. With the ascendancy
of President Donald Trump to the White House, a strong focus has been
placed on his role as a promoter of racism and national oppression
domestically, along with warmongering abroad. We observe keenly the
escalation of tension in the Korean peninsula with the placement of the
Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile system. The president's
posture in relationship to the government of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea threatened the full resumption of an unresolved war
just several weeks ago. There have been increasing aerial attacks
against purported al-Qaida targets in Yemen while the people in this
Middle Eastern state, the least developed in the region, are suffering
immensely from the Pentagon-coordinated war involving Saudi Arabian and
Gulf Cooperation Council bombings, which have continued on a daily basis
since March 2015, killing an estimated 12,000 people and prompting the
widespread outbreak of cholera, impacting over 60,000. The deployment of
the Massive Ordnance Air Blast in Afghanistan represented a new level of
warfare in that Central Asian country, which has been the focus of U.S.
policy since at least 1979, when Islamist forces were unleashed against
the Soviet-backed socialist government then in power. [Since 2001, [the
Pentagon and NATO have laid **waste** to]{.mark} the country further,
with thousands of **foreign troops** continuing to occupy the area.
[Somalia,]{.mark} Zimbabwe, South Africa, [Libya and
beyond]{.mark}]{.underline} Although the Trump administration's foreign
policy towards Africa has gained far less attention by the Western
media, it has continued already existing hostilities on the African
continent. [Somalia was singled out when Trump ordered the
**escalation** of Pentagon and Central Intelligence Agency personnel
being stationed in this Horn of Africa state]{.underline}. A U.S. Navy
Seal was killed by al-Shabab guerrilla units several weeks ago while
embedded in the U.S. and European Union-backed Somali National Army.
Although the administration claimed it was doing away with the supposed
restrictions on military actions in Somalia imposed by former President
Barack Obama, the interventions by the U.S. in Somalia go back as far as
the late 1970s. When Jimmy Carter was in the Oval Office, the U.S.
encouraged an invasion by the government of then-President Mohamed Siad
Barre against the Ogaden region of Ethiopia. The waning days of the
George H.W. Bush tenure were marked by the invasion of 12,000 Marines
into Somalia in the failed "Operation Restore Hope" beginning in
December 1992, a plan inherited by Bill Clinton, which ended in disaster
when the people rose up against the occupation. [[Since 2006, the
U.S.,]{.mark} then under President George W. Bush, [has
encouraged]{.mark} and sponsored [**intervention** **into Somali**
national affairs]{.mark}]{.underline}. First by seeking to empower
warlords to subvert the efforts of the Union of Islamic Courts (UIC)
and, after 2009, by recruiting elements of the UIC into the interim
federal regime, Washington sought to guide political events in the
oil-rich state. Several neighboring states have been drawn into the
African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM), which now has approximately
22,000 troops from Kenya, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Burundi and Uganda. Police
officers from Ghana, Sierra Leone and Nigeria are also a part of the
mission. [In 1998, Britain, the former colonial power, along with [the
U.S.,]{.mark} the EU and others, [began imposing **sanctions**
on]{.mark} the government of the southern African nation of
[Zimbabw]{.mark}]{.underline}[e]{.mark} and the Zimbabwe African
National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), led by President Robert
Mugabe. [In 2000, [when Zimbabwe passed legislation granting the right
of the African people to **radically** redistribute land]{.mark} to the
people, [the **sanctions** and]{.mark} other forms of [hostile
**propaganda** deepened.]{.mark}]{.underline} During the period of
1998-2000, the administration of President Bill Clinton was in power.
The same sanctions continued through the entire two terms of the Bush
White House. When Obama took office in January 2009, his regime
continued and intensified the punitive measures against the ZANU-PF
ruling party and various political officials, including President
Mugabe. Both Britain and the U.S. attempted to persuade South Africa,
while former President Thabo Mbeki was in office, to impose a blockade
on Zimbabwe. Britain also drew up plans for an evacuation of its settler
population, who held United Kingdom passports. These suggestions failed
and through the assistance of successive African National Congress
governments, the support of the regional Southern African Development
Community and the People's Republic of China, Zimbabwe has been able to
remain afloat. [U.S. imperialism through Africom]{.underline} This, of
course, was not the case in the oil-rich North African nation of Libya,
which under the Jamahiriya system headed by Col. Muammar Gaddafi had
attained the highest standard of living anywhere on the continent. It
was [the Democratic administration of [Obama]{.mark}]{.underline}, with
Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, which [[coordinated a **war** of
regime-change]{.mark} and genocide [that]{.mark} **[destroyed
Libya]{.mark}** as a viable state.]{.underline} Gaddafi was driven from
the capital of Tripoli in August 2011 and later captured and brutally
murdered by imperialist agents on Oct. 20 of the same year. [Today,
Libya is a major source of **instability** **and human trafficking**
internationally.]{.underline} Thousands have died off the coast of Libya
in the Mediterranean Sea in attempts to flee the chaos and
impoverishment there and throughout other regions of Africa and the
Middle East. Now there are at least three identifiable regimes in Libya,
which often engage in deadly military struggles for political and
economic authority. The country has gone from being Africa's most
prosperous to dire poverty and balkanization. Numerous attempts by
counterrevolutionary elements backed up by the White House, EU
member-states and the United Nations to form a viable government have
failed. [The situation in Libya is a direct result of the foreign policy
of Barack Obama towards the African continent. [Since the launching
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the U.S. Africa Command
([[Africom]{.underline}]{.mark}) in 2008 under Bush, [[the presence of
U.S. military forces]{.mark} [on the continent has **increased
substantially**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Obama announced just two years
prior to leaving office that his administration would deploy in excess
of 3,500 Special Forces and military trainers across 36 nations. A
military base in the Horn of Africa state of Djibouti has been expanded
and houses thousands of U.S. troops at Camp Lemonnier. [[**Imperialism**
in Africa]{.mark} today [is]{.mark} at a critical stage, [impeding the
capacity of nation-states to direct their **own
futures**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Despite Africa's vast mineral and
agricultural wealth and its labor power, [[a renewed]{.mark} [**debt
crisis** compounded by Pentagon]{.mark}, CIA and State Department
interference [is **reversing** the gains made in previous
years.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### AFRICOM is an extension of [police brutality]{.underline} and [state terror]{.underline} against activists.

**Schmidt '10** (Michael Schmidt, researcher and journalist for
pambazuka news, an organization which prioritizes discussion of
radicalism and justice, 4 February 2010, "The new American imperialism
in Africa",
https://www.pambazuka.org/governance/new-american-imperialism-africa,
Michael Schmidt reveals the alarming extent of American military
expansion in Africa. This article was written four years ago, but still
holds strong relevance today in the context of United States Africa
Command (AFRICOM). Schmidt describes three avenues that the US is taking
to increase its military foothold in Africa in pursuit of its 'War on
Terror': 'piggybacking' off already strong French military presence,
creating an unofficial 'School of the Africas' in the guise of the
African Centre for Strategic Studies, and with its Africa Contingency
Operations Training Assistance (ACOTA) programme 'aimed at integrating
African armed forces into US strategic (imperialist) objectives'.
Schmidt places blame beyond the US, however, and uncovers the role that
African countries, particularly South Africa, are playing in
strengthening US military presence through 'secret pacts'. In light of
all this, Schmidt concludes with a warning: 'It would be naïve to think
that bourgeois democracy... will protect the working class, peasantry
and poor from state terrorism.') \\\\EG

The programmes that Fraser mentions include the 'Next Generation of
African Military Leaders' course run by the shady African Centre for
Strategic Studies based in Washington, which has 'chapters' in various
African countries including South Africa. [[The Centre appears to
be]{.mark} a sort of 'School of the Africas' [similar to the]{.mark}
infamous '**[School of the Americas']{.mark}** based at Fort Benning in
Georgia.]{.underline} In 2001, it was renamed the Western Hemisphere
Institute for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC). Founded in 1946 in Panama,
[[the School]{.mark} of the Americas has [trained]{.mark} some
60,000]{.underline} Latin American [soldiers]{.underline}, [including
notorious [neo-Nazi]{.mark} Bolivian [**dictator** Hugo Banzer, infamous
Panamanian dictator]{.mark} and drug czar [Manuel
Noriega]{.mark},]{.underline} Argentine dictators Leopoldo Galtieri and
Roberto Viola whose regime murdered 30,000 people between 1976 and 1983,
numerous death-squad killers, and Efrain Vasquez and Ramirez Poveda who
staged a failed US-backed coup in Venezuela in 2002. [Over the decades,
[graduates of the School have **murdered and tortured** hundreds of
thousands of people across Latin America, specifically targeting]{.mark}
trade union leaders, [**grassroots activists**, students]{.mark},
guerrilla units, [and political opponents.]{.mark} The murder of
Archbishop **Oscar Romero** of Nicaragua, in 1980, and the 'El Mozote'
massacre of 767 villagers in El Salvador, in 1981, were committed by
graduates of the School]{.underline}. And yet the School of the Americas
Watch, an organisation trying to shut WHINSEC down, is on an FBI
'anti-terrorism' watch-list[. So [Africa should be **concerned** if the
African Centre for Strategic Studies has similar objectives]{.mark},
even if the School of the Americas Watch cannot confirm these
fears?]{.underline} There is more: we've all heard of the 'Standby
Force' being devised by the African Union (AU), a coalition of Africa's
authoritarian neo-liberal regimes. But the AU has also set up, under the
patronage of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe --
which also covers North America, Russia and Central Asia -- the African
Centre for the Study and Research of Terrorism. The Centre is based in
Algiers in Algeria, at the heart of a murderous regime that has itself
'made disappear' some 3,000 people between 1992 and 2003 (according to
Amnesty International this is equivalent to the Pinochet dictatorship in
Chile, but it is a fact ignored by the African left). [The Centre's
director, Abdelhamid Boubazine told me that it would not only be a
think-tank and trainer of 'anti-terrorism' judges, but that it would
also have teeth and would provide training in '**specific armed
intervention'** to support the continent's regimes.]{.underline} Anneli
Botha, the senior researcher on terrorism at the Pretoria-based
Institute for Security Studies, said though, that only ten per cent of
terrorist attacks in Africa were on armed forces, and only six per cent
were on state figures and institutions, though the latter were
'focused'. She warned that a major cause of African terrorism was 'a
growing void between government and security forces on the one hand, and
local communities on the other'. Caught in the grip of misery and
poverty, many people are recruited into rebel armies even though few of
these offer any sort of real solution. [[The Centre in Algiers operates
under the]{.mark} AU's 'Algiers Convention on Terrorism', which is
notoriously [vague]{.mark} on the [definition of **terrorism**. This
opens the door for a wide range of]{.mark} non-governmental, [protest,
**grassroots**, civic, and militant organisations to be **targeted for
elimination**]{.mark} by the new counter-terrorism forces.]{.underline}
[[It would be **naïve** to think that]{.underline}]{.mark} bourgeois
[[democracy]{.underline}]{.mark} -- which passed [South
Africa's]{.underline} equally vaguely-defined Protection of
[Constitutional Democracy]{.underline} from Terrorism and Other Related
Activities Act into law last year -- [[will protect the working
class]{.mark}, peasantry and poor [from **state
terrorism**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[There is a real---but largely **concealed**---war which is taking place
throughout the African continent]{.underline}. It involves the United
States, an invigorated Russia and a rising China. The outcome of the war
is likely to define the future of the continent and its global outlook.
It is easy to pin the blame on US President Donald Trump, his erratic
agenda and impulsive statements. But the truth is [the [current US
military **expansion** in Africa is]{.mark} just [another step in the
wrong direction]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is part of a strategy that had
been implemented a decade ago, during the administration of President
George W. Bush, and actively pursued by President Barack Obama. [In
2007, under the pretext of the 'war on terror', the US consolidated its
various military operations in Africa to establish the United States
Africa Command (**AFRICOM**]{.underline}). With a starting budget of
half a billion dollars, AFRICOM was supposedly launched to engage with
African countries in terms of diplomacy and aid. But, [over the course
of the last 10 years, [AFRICOM has been **transformed** into a central
command for military]{.mark} incursions and [interventions.]{.mark}
However, [that **violent** role has]{.mark} rapidly [worsened
during]{.mark} the first year of [Trump's]{.mark} [term]{.mark} in
office.]{.underline} Indeed, there is a hidden US war in Africa, and it
is fought in the name of 'counter-terrorism'. According to a VICE News
special investigation, [[US troops]{.mark} are now [conduct]{.mark}ing
[3,500 exercises]{.mark} and military engagements [throughout Africa per
year]{.mark}, an average of **10 per day**. US mainstream [media rarely
discusses]{.mark} [this]{.mark} ongoing [war, thus giving the
military]{.mark} **ample [space]{.mark}** [to **destabilize**
any]{.mark} of the continent's 54 [countries as it
pleases]{.mark}]{.underline}. "Today's figure of 3,500 marks an
astounding 1,900 percent increase since the command was activated less
than a decade ago, and suggests a major expansion of US military
activities on the African continent," VICE reported. Following the death
of four US Special Forces soldiers in Niger on October 4, US Secretary
of Defense James Mattis made an ominous declaration to a Senate
committee: these numbers are likely to increase as the US is expanding
its military activities in Africa. [[Mattis]{.mark}, like other defense
officials in the previous two administrations, [justifies]{.mark} the
[US military transgressions]{.mark} [as]{.mark} part of ongoing
'[counter-terror]{.mark}ism' efforts. But [such coded reference has
served as a **pretense** for the US to]{.mark} intervene in, and
**[exploit]{.mark}**, a massive region with a great economic potential.
[The]{.mark} old [colonial '**Scramble for Africa'** is being
reinvented]{.mark} by global powers [that]{.mark} fully fathom the
extent of the untapped economic largesse of the continent]{.underline}.
While China, India and Russia are each developing a unique approach to
wooing Africa, [the US is invested mostly in the **military**
**option**, which [promises to]{.mark} inflict untold harm and
[**destabilize** many nations. The 2012 coup in Mali, carried out by a
US]{.mark}-trained [army]{.mark} captain]{.underline}, Amadou Haya
Sanogo, [[is]{.mark} only [one example]{.mark}]{.underline}. In a 2013
speech, then US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton cautioned against a
"new colonialism in Africa (in which it is) easy to come in, take out
natural resources, pay off leaders and leave." While Clinton is, of
course, correct, she was disingenuously referring to China, not her own
country. China's increasing influence in Africa is obvious, and
Beijing's practices can be unfair. However, China's policy towards
Africa is far more civil and trade-focused than the military-centered US
approach. The growth in the China-Africa trade figures are, as per a UN
News report in 2013, happening at a truly "breathtaking pace", as they
jumped from around \$10.5 billion per year in 2000 to \$166 billion in
2011. Since then, it has continued at the same impressive pace. But that
growth was coupled with many initiatives, entailing many billions of
dollars in Chinese credit to African countries to develop badly needed
infrastructure. More went to finance the 'African Talents Program',
which is designed to train 30,000 African professionals in various
sectors. It should come as no surprise, then, that China surpassed the
US as Africa's largest trading partner in 2009. The real colonialism,
which Clinton referred to in her speech, is, however, under way in the
US's own perception and behavior towards Africa. This is not a
hyperbole, but in fact a statement that echoes the words of US President
Trump himself.

The way the U.S. military defines their battlefield, or "area of
operations," differs greatly from how the average person thinks of the
stages of war. I have studied [[the government's]{.mark}]{.underline}
relationship to Black liberation efforts in the United States for
several years now, and [their [area of operations is as much
**AFRICOM**]{.mark}, Venezuela, [or Haiti as it was **Ferguson**.
AFRICOM is the]{.mark} cumulative [relationship]{.mark} our military has
[with]{.mark} a majority of the [countries in Africa]{.mark}, where they
support **strategic allies** through armed conflict and strategic
humanitarian aid in exchange [for control over **assets** within the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tate[s' interest]{.mark}.]{.underline} In
Venezuela, the U.S. is attempting to enact regime change, while in Haiti
they are attempting to ensure the regime is not changed amidst intense
protest. [[The goal]{.mark} in each of these situations [is to meet the
**mission**]{.mark} criteria [outlined by our
government]{.mark}]{.underline} and their senior officials. As it
relates to Black liberation efforts in the United States, [[the goals of
the State will always be to ensure the future of the **U.S.**
**Empire**]{.underline}. [Throughout the]{.underline}]{.mark} [entire
[history of the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, [there has been]{.mark}
a particular [violence]{.mark}]{.underline} and brutality that has been
[[**reserved** for African Americans]{.underline}]{.mark}, Black
Americans in general, and Native Americans, [[which has]{.mark}
selectively [been **extended** to people outside]{.mark} of these groups
under very specific circumstances. The entire foundation of American
society is built on our **shared oppression**, and if that oppression
were to stop, so would American society]{.underline}. Since before the
Trail of Tears and the technical end of chattel slavery, African
Americans, Black Americans more broadly, and Native Americans have been
fighting to end our genocide, with the most radical of us recognizing
that we cannot be free without a complete restructuring of modern
society. As time went on, the State recognized this as well, and made a
strategic effort to counter our efforts. [Although [the State]{.mark}
technically cannot enact targeted action against U.S. citizens, they
[have historically]{.mark} strategically **[circumvented]{.mark}** these
[prohibitions to ensure]{.mark} our [**continued oppression**, which
allows them to retain a non-authoritarian image]{.mark} to the larger
U.S. population and global allies [while being an **authoritarian

[If Black lives **don't matter** enough to say that #BlackLivesMatter,
[African lives **don't exist**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Living in America
is an exercise in frustrating tolerance of a people who fail to
recognize their ceaseless exploitation of African lives, land and
resources. [[Most Americans are **ignorant** of this country's role in

middle eastern **conflict**.]{.underline} The simplest way to understand
this willful ignorance is in the same way that the United States
responds to their "original sin" of African chattel slavery. Currently,
the Trump White House and the Republican Party are striving to unify a
broad cross section of Americans on the tacit basis of race,
specifically the white race. The world that Western Europe has
balkanized and pillaged is untenable, so they are going back to basics:
white is right. In the midst of the unprecedented Supreme Court ruling
overturning the Kenyan presidential election and the emerging boycott of
incumbent Uhuru Kenyatta and his Jubilee party, African self
determination must be ignored. [[This is]{.mark} the [U.S.
policy]{.mark} when it comes to Africans, [black lives don't
matter,]{.mark} thus [Africans]{.mark}, the source of all humanity,
**[do not exist]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By 2043 the United States will
be predominantly black and brown. That cannot stand if "Manifest
Destiny," the white man's "God given" right to control North American
resources, is to hold. [The policies and practices of the Republican
party are beholden to a **white oligarchy** that has funded the party's
candidates and exploits since the late 1970s]{.underline}. People like
the Koch Brothers owners of Koch Industries, the second-largest
privately owned company in the United States, David D.Smith of Sinclair
Broadcasting Group, the nation's largest owner of television stations,
and Robert Mercer, major funder of Breitbart Media, The Trump Campaign
and Brexit Campaign, have a vested interest in unfettered white
supremacist power. These men represent the top tenth of the top one
percent of wealth that former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders was
railing against during the 2016 U.S. presidential primaries. In order
[to maintain the grossly **unequal** position they hold, they
must]{.underline} continue to extract outdated energy sources like
petroleum, deny verified science around climate change and beat back the
coming tide of mixed race, black and brown people. [Just as [this nation
seeks to **deny** **the agency**]{.mark} and leadership [of]{.mark}
African descendants in America, they must also deny [the]{.mark} agency
of [African people.]{.mark}]{.underline} As a Kenyan, [[this has]{.mark}
never [been clear]{.mark}er than [with this year's presidential
election, an election fraught with **blatant corruption**]{.mark} from
the incumbent Jubilee Party, [and yet every Western observer
i]{.mark}ncluding the Unites States [deemed the election **free and
fair**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The absurdity of this determination
alongside a reality TV star in the White House after, by most accounts,
the best president in modern U.S. history, is laughable. The Cliff Notes
version of modern Kenyan politics is as follows: President Uhuru
Kenyatta is the son of Kenya's first president Jomo Kenyatta. After
being jailed, tortured then released by the British for his role in
fighting for independence, the return of ancestral land and self
determination of Kenyan people, he turned around and jailed a number of
his allies. Among the leaders he jailed to send a message that he was
the new extension of colonial domination, was the late Oginga
Odinga---jailed after serving as Kenya's first Vice President when he
exchanged in a public war of words with Kenyatta. In the midst of
jailing his allies, Kenyatta also walked off with a gaggle of ancestral
land returned by the British, hoarding a majority and leaving thousands
of his own people landless until this day. Oginga Odinga was eventually
released and spent all his life determined the reclaim the moral soul of
Kenya that was sold by Kenyatta to the British, who still maintain a
neocolonial relationship with the country. Odinga's son Raila Odinga
over the course of nearly forty years has emerged as Kenya's strongest
opposition leader, extolling egalitarian and democratic socialist values
similar to his father and skeptical of Western interests and modern
capitalism. Because Raila Odinga is not pandering to U.S. and Western
European values of greed and mass exploitation, he seems untrustworthy
to them. To the everyday Kenyan, he seems obstinate at worst or
fundamentally genuine at best. Arguably, [Raila Odinga has won every
election since 2007, but his rival [Uhuru Kenyatta]{.mark} has British
allegiance and is among the the richest men in Africa so ballots are
stuffed, critics are intimidated, police or thugs are paid to cause
trouble and no matter what, Uhuru **[always wins]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Cut to 2017. This year's August 8th election was a sham. Mere
[[days]{.mark} [before]{.mark} this year's [election, the
technician]{.mark} charged [with]{.mark} securing [the]{.mark}
computerized [voting system]{.mark}]{.underline} under the country's
Independent Electoral Boundaries Commission (IEBC), Chris Msando,
[[was]{.mark} **tortured and [murdered]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 79
percent of Kenya's 19.6 million registered voters went to the polls
knowing full well what happened, praying their votes mattered.
[Despite]{.underline} exit [**polling** that]{.underline} projected
[Odinga]{.underline} of the [National Super Alliance (NASA) party to
win, he **predictably lo**st]{.underline}. All [foreign observers
including American John Kerry, who deemed the votes **"free, fair and
credible,"** supported the results]{.underline}. Most Kenyans, based on
past experience and logical deduction did not. NASA took their
grievances to the Supreme Court and in a landmark ruling, the first time
in African history and the fourth time in world history, the
presidential election results were overturned. The response throughout
Africa, that has been saddled by decrepit, greedy patriarchs since the
murder of Patrice Lumumba, was resoundingly positive and hopeful. In the
West, there was incredulity and paranoia about rampant bloodshed and
crumbling allegiances---nevermind a totally fraudulent election... which
puts Donald Trump in perspective. Over the course of four failed bids
for president since 2002 Raila Odinga helped usher in a new, democratic
constitution in 2010, deemed only second to South Africa in the rights
it protects and boasts the strongest Bill of Rights on The Continent. He
also helped incrementally build (tacit) credibility of Kenya's court
system by regularly bringing electoral disputes to the new Supreme
Court, established in 2010 with the constitution. This is not the first
time Kenya has made world history to lukewarm adulation. In 2010 Kenyan
crowd mapping platform Ushahidi, developed in 2008 after the December
2007 elections to plot reports of violence, was the tech used in the
Arab Spring and subsequently across the globe from Haiti to Japan to
Palestine to Australia in times of crisis. Kenya's revolutionary
electronic money platform M-Pesa is now used globally. Even the power
sharing agreement between Kenyatta and Odinga following the 2007
disputed election set precedent across Africa. [Again, [if black lives
**don't matter** in the U.S. why would they **matter** in Brazil,
France, or India?]{.mark} How could African lives, people so "black"
that the construct of race is no longer a signifier,
matter?]{.underline} The answer is that [[within a Eurocentric world,
**dehumanizing** blackness is critical to **exalting** whiteness]{.mark}
and is stands to reason the minimizing African self determination,
exalts European superiority]{.underline}. Thankfully, in Kenya, the
construct of race and fallacy of Western superiority is an observable
lie. [When NASA and Odinga brought the results of the August 8th
elections to the Supreme Court they ruled that the results were
"**neither transparent nor verifiable**," a fitting metaphor for Western
opinion or credibility. [The **superiority** of Europe over Africa is
"**neither transparent nor verifiable**." The notion that African lives
don't exist is "**neither transparent nor
verifiable**."]{.mark}]{.underline} The rerun of the the Kenyan election
on October 28th was boycotted by a majority of voters because attempts
to secure [the voting system and process was "**neither transparent nor
verifiable**."]{.underline} Uhuru Kenyatta claims he is the victor even
though only 38.84 percent of registered voters turned out to the polls
and his "victory" garnered a ludacris 98 percent of the vote. Please.
Kenyatta has chosen to retaliate against the Nyanza region, the NASA
opposition stronghold, by terrorising, beating and killing people who
protest or simply for existing. Furthermore, another IEBC official,
Caroline Odinga, serving as Deputy Presiding Officer in Siaya County was
sexually assaulted and murdered in late August. Eight days before the
rerun election, IEBC senior official Roselyn Akombe, resigned and fled
the country to New York City amid death threats, stating that IEBC was
not fit to meet the basic expectations of a free, fair, and credible
election. [Is it that [African lives **only matter** when
Western]{.mark} media and [governments can point to]{.mark} our
[mutilated bodies]{.mark} [and say "**see, these people can't
govern**]{.mark}?" No matter what [they]{.mark} claim, the **foreign
observers** who knowingly supported a dictator in an Armani suit and
undermined the democratic voice of a people [have **blood on their
hands**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The fact of the matter is that Kenya is at
a crossroads, that some say is the battle for its soul, charge taken on
by Oginga Odinga, his son Raila Odinga and perhaps must be carried on by
the Kenyan people as whole. What happens now and the role the the
international community plays says a lot about internal commitment to
democracy and external recognition of African voices, lives and values.
Something tells me that to most Kenyans, African Lives Matter.

[[Across Africa, the US military has engaged in]{.mark} a panoply of
**[aid]{.mark}** projects with an eye [toward winning a **war of ideas**
in the minds of Africans]{.mark} and so beating back the lure of
**extremist ideologies**. [These]{.mark} so-called civil-military
[operations]{.mark} (CMOs) [include "**humanitarian**]{.mark}
assistance" [projects like]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[construction]{.underline}]{.mark} or repair [[of]{.underline}]{.mark}
schools, water [[wells]{.mark}, and waste treatment
systems]{.underline}, and "humanitarian and civic assistance" (HCA)
efforts, like offering dental and veterinary care. Kindness may be its
own reward, but [in the case of the US military, [CMO benevolence is
designed to **influence** foreign governments and civilian
populations]{.mark}]{.underline} in order [[to]{.mark} "facilitate
**military operations** and [achieve U.S.
**objectives**]{.mark}."]{.underline} [According to the Pentagon,
[humanitarian]{.mark} assistance [efforts are engineered to]{.mark}
[improve "U.S. **visibility**]{.mark}, access, [and
**influence**]{.mark} with foreign military and civilian
counterparts,"]{.underline} [while]{.underline} HCA [projects are
designed to "promote the security and foreign policy interests of the
United States]{.underline}." In the bureaucratic world of the US
military, these small-scale efforts are further divided into "community
relations activities," like the distribution of sports equipment, and
"low-cost activities" such as seminars on solar panel maintenance or
English-language discussion groups. Theoretically at least, add all
these projects together and you've taken a major step toward winning
Africans away from the influence of extremists. But are these projects
working at all? Has anyone even bothered to check? In one report the
Department of Defense's inspector general found record-keeping by the US
military in Africa so abysmal that its officials "did not have an
effective system to manage or report community relations and low cost
activities." A spreadsheet supposedly tracking community low-cost
activities during 2012 and 2013 was so incomplete that 43 percent of
such efforts went unmentioned. Nonetheless, the inspector general did
manage to review 49 of 137 identified humanitarian assistance and civic
assistance projects, which cost US taxpayers about \$9 million, and
found that the military officials overseeing CMO "did not adequately
plan or execute" them in accordance with AFRICOM's "objectives." The
task force also failed to report or could not provide information on
expenditures for four of six projects selected for special review,
despite a requirement to do so and the use of a computerized system
specifically designed to track such information. These projects --- two
schools and a clinic in Djibouti as well as a school in Ethiopia ---
cost American taxpayers almost \$1.3 million, yet US officials failed to
properly account for where all that money actually went. All told,
officials were unable to verify whether almost \$229,000 in taxpayer
dollars spent on such projects were properly accounted for.
Investigators only inspected four humanitarian assistance worksites ---
two in Djibouti and two in Tanzania --- but even in this tiny sample
found one site where the United States military had failed to ensure
that the host nation would sustain the project. At the Ali Sabieh
Community Water Fountains in Djibouti, renovated by the United States in
2010 to minimize waterborne disease, investigators found a scene of
utter disrepair. Doors, pipes, and faucets "had been removed," while
another faucet "had a collapsed top," leaving the water "exposed to
contaminants." Photographs taken two years after the project was
completed display dilapidated, crumbling, and seemingly jerry-rigged
structures. [[One American official assured]{.mark} inspector general
investigators of [the **necessity** of obtaining host]{.mark} [nation
**"buy-in"** on]{.mark} such [projects]{.mark} to **achieve success**,
while another suggested it was crucial that local "**sweat equity**" be
invested in such projects, [if they weren't to become "**monuments to
U.S. failure**."]{.mark}]{.underline} In Djibouti, however, local
residents were apparently given no information about upkeep of the Ali
Sabieh project. As a result, Djiboutians threw rocks into a well built
by Americans, a method that works to raise water in indigenously built
wells. In this case, however, it damaged the well so badly that it
stopped working. [Examining a sample of projects, [the Pentagon's
investigators found that **73 percent** of]{.mark} the time CJTF-[HOA
personnel failed to collect sufficient data]{.mark} thirty days after
completion of projects[, to assess whether it achieved the]{.mark}
stated [objectives.]{.mark}]{.underline} For example, at a medical
clinic at Manza Bay, the United States built cisterns and a water
catchment system. [[The project was]{.mark} apparently [considered a
**success**]{.mark}, but the military had **very little data** to back
up that claim. In Garissa, in neighboring Kenya, a veterinary civic
action project was evidently also declared a triumph without anything to
prove it beyond vague upbeat claims of success in impressing local
residents.]{.underline}

#### The market of global capitalism [securitizes]{.underline} Africa through AFRICOM.

\\\\EG

When Africa was discursively a politicized issue, US foreign relations
and military engagements with Africa had been characterized through
joint military exercises; training programs with African militaries;
covert military operations, counter-terrorism operations; peacekeeping;
and peace support operation deployments (Francis, 2010: 10).
[[The]{.mark} Department of Defense ([DoD]{.mark}),]{.underline}
according to Theresa Whelan a former US national intelligence director
of Africa between the years 2003 to 2011, [[has never focussed on Africa
in the **same level**]{.mark} **of consistency** it has [on other
regions]{.mark} of the world]{.underline} (Francis, 2010). This is
reaffirmed by Robert Putman explicitly stating that "[Despite historic
ties with the continent, [US policy towards]{.mark} [Africa has]{.mark}
generally [been marked by **indifference and
neglect**]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Francis, 2010: 11) because the dominant
theme which characterized "US foreign relations in Africa was driven by
US exceptionalism (Francis, 2010: 11). Post-9/11 we begin noticing the
repositioning of Africa into the discourse of US strategic national
interest. [[African **securitization** was acknowledged]{.mark} [by
explicating]{.mark} to the international community [that Africa poses an
international **security threat** to the US]{.mark} in terms of
**violent wars**, armed conflicts]{.underline}, the proliferation of
underdevelopment and HIV/AIDS, and finally failed states serving as
terrorist havens (Francis, 2010: 12). Thus, in the last six decades,
US-African relations have never been dominated by one single security
sector. Rather the complexity of the relationship more so after the Cold
War and further since the GWOT was marked by "selective engagement,
neglect, contradictions and retreat" (Francis, 2010: 12). This labyrinth
of complexities was captured in a report released in 2005 by the Centre
for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). "[The region \[Africa\]
starkly illustrates both the challenges and the promise of efforts to
foster democracy, respect for human rights, poverty alleviation,
counterterrorism, regional conflict prevention and
peacekeeping,]{.underline} and to curb HIV/AIDS and other infections
diseases, organized crime, corruption, and instability. Also at stake
are rising US. interests in the region's energy sector, already
prominent and set to expand even further in the coming decade. At the
same time, many countries in the region are vulnerable to instability
and violence, stemming from vast internal disparities in wealth, poor
governance, a lack of state capacity, and rising criminality" (Morrison
and Goldwyn, 2005). In the year 2000 President Bush stated that "while
Africa may be important, it does not fit into the national strategic
interest as far as I can see them" (Francis, 2010: 10). [[After 9/11,
the threat to US energy security]{.mark} and the **new scramble for
Afric**a [pressed]{.mark} the [Bush]{.mark} administration in 2007 [to
regard African oil resources as a "**strategic national
interest**]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Francis, 2010: 10). It should be noted
that the perception of Africa being perceived as a strategic hub for
American resources was a "politicized thought process" published in 1997
by AFRICOM which states that the alteration in US interest towards
Africa was "the culmination of a ten-year thought process within the
Department of Defense" (Keenan, 2010: 113). [The year 1997 was a
critical year for the US informal empire because it reached the
**psychological critical** 50% resulting in President George [Bush
uttering a speech]{.mark} act, in the year 2000 [during his election
campaign making energy security a **top priority**]{.mark} (Keenan,
2010). [This securitization led to the]{.mark} publication of the
**[Cheney Report]{.mark}** in 2001 by the National Energy Policy
Development Group]{.underline} (Cheney and Powell, 2001).. The report
forecasted that by 2020 US oil consumption would increase by 32% and
that sub-Saharan Africa was the future source of US oil Al-Kassimi 307
supplies (Cheney and Powell, 2001). [[The]{.mark} Cheney [report]{.mark}
(Keenan, 2010: 113) [highlighted African oil as]{.mark} a "strategic
national interest" thus [an "**economic-frontier**" that the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [might choose military force to
control]{.mark}]{.underline} (Volman, 2003). The continuation of
AFRICOM's thought process produced the African Oil Policy Initiative
Group (AOPIG, 2002) which included members such as Don Norland, former
US ambassador to Chad, and Lt. Col. Karen Kwiatkowski of the US Air
Force who is tied to the DoD African policy unit (all security experts
who possess political capital). They published another geostrategic
study highlighting Africa's increased importance entitled "African Oil:
A Priority for US National Security and African Development" (Forte,
2012). [In 2002, AOPIG weaved military and economic goals by stating
that the US required a command structure that is strictly dedicated to
the African continent to protect **US investments** and interests
because by 2015 the study postulated, Africa would be the main supplier
of US oil imports]{.underline} instead of the Persian Gulf (Forte,
2012). AOPIG not only alluded to the importance of fossil fuels but also
the deposits of critically important strategic minerals such as
"chromium, uranium, cobalt, titanium, diamonds, gold, bauxite,
phosphate, and copper" (African Oil Policy Initiative, 2002: 12; Cope,
2016: 256). The US is imperative in securing strategic minerals in
Africa as mentioned by Harry Magdoff (2003: 55) because "the Defense
Department operates with a list of strategic and critical minerals as a
guide to the stockpiling program. These are the materials which are
assumed to be critical to the war potential of the US. We must note that
the US depends on 80 to 100% on importing strategic minerals".
Mozambique produces 18% of the supply of columbium; South Africa
produces 31% of the supply of chromium, and the Congo produces 60% of
the supply of Cobalt (Magdoff, 2003). Unified protest across Africa took
place when President Bush announced in October 2008 the activation of
the United Stated African Command (AFRICOM). Firstly, the establishment
is a fundamental shift in the way the US engages with Africa on foreign
policy terms because for more than four decades the responsibility of
the continent was divided amongst two departments: The Department of
Defense (DoD) and the US international agency for development (USAID),
as well as three separate military commands EUCOM, CENTCOM and PACOM
(Francis, 2010). Thus, the establishment of a command center that is
specific to the African continent would naturally instigate debates
about the motivations and intentions of such structure. Disapproval has
been expressed by the African Union (AU) and the Southern Africa
Development Community (SADC) by refusing to host the location of AFRICOM
on African territory; Liberia was the sole country that expressed
interest in hosting AFRICOM (Francis, 2010). This refusal is fueled by
the belief that AFRICOM is an extension of the US informal empire which
amounts to the militarisation of US foreign policy towards Africa to
achieve US strategic economic interest on the continent. [This belief
holds veritas when we remember that President [Obama stated that US
strategy in Africa is linked to benefit]{.mark} and promotion of
**[corporate interests]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Forte (2012: 196) reminds
us of [Obama's corporate **capitalist** character when he stated that by
expanding "Africa's capacity to access and benefit from the **global
markets**, promote **regional integration**, and strengthen economic
governance" US corporations, "can and should play a role in this
process". [This **corporate-expansionist mindset** is facilitated
through]{.mark} the [Young African Leaders Initiative]{.mark} program
launched in 2012. The program is [dedicated to raising African]{.mark}
technocrats and [politicians that are]{.mark} more [prone in
dealing]{.mark} comfortably [with US thereby **advancing their corporate
ventures**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Forte, 2012). [AFRICOM, being perceived
as a military command structure of the US informal empire which seeks to
expand its economic-frontier, possesses **currency** amongst scholars of
security studies]{.underline}. Academics argue that AFRICOM is an
attempt to counter-balance China's relation with the continent which by
2009 had invested over US\$100 billion and possessed more than 2000
companies working across the continent (Forte, 2012). Not only that,
Africa provides one-third of Chinese crude oil imports, and la pièce de
résistance is China providing an alternative bilateral monetary
mechanism that provides loans to weak African economies rather than
requesting loans from the IMF and the World Bank (Francis, 2010).
Furthermore, [critical [voices characterize AFRICOM as a **strategic
attempt** to protect the]{.mark} oil and [energy security of the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates which according to Swart "is increasingly
becoming important to the world **energy supplies** even as the region
remains under threat from lawlessness and piracy]{.underline}" (Francis,
2010: 6). [[Military command structures have historically been
established to]{.mark} intimidate or **[coerce rival powers]{.mark}**
and [there is not a reason]{.mark} to believe [that AFRICOM will alter
such]{.mark} perception]{.underline}. Editors (2002) of the Monthly
Review stated that US global reach through the projection of foreign
bases and command structures are but a means to access, protect, and
control US strategic national interests in the world. The quote is a
reminder [that Williams "age of corporate capitalism" still
characterizes American US foreign policy and that military command
structures persist in **expanding** the economic-frontier of the
informal empire]{.underline}. The Editor's note that: "[[The projection
of US military power into new regions]{.mark} through the establishment
of US military bases [should not]{.mark}, of course, [be seen simply in
terms of **direct military ends**. They are always used to promote the
economic]{.mark} and political [objectives of US **capitalism**.]{.mark}
For example, US corporations and the US government have been eager for
some time to build a secure corridor for US-controlled oil and natural
gas pipelines from the Caspian Sea in Central Asia through Afghanistan
and Pakistan to the Arabian Sea]{.underline}. What is clear at present
and bears repeating is that such bases are now being acquired in areas
where the United States had previously lost much of its "forward
presence" such as in the Middle East and Africa. There can be no doubt,
therefore, that the last remaining superpower is presently on a course
of imperial expansion, as a means of promoting its political and
economic interests, and that the present war on terrorism, which is in
many ways an indirect product of the projection of US power, is now
being used to justify the further projection of that power." The
securitization of Africa during President Bush and Obama was successful
since Africa has historically been associated with all three felicity
conditions mentioned earlier. Africa was "othered" in political
discourse thereby justifying the establishment of AFRICOM and its
mission. The following section will highlight how Africa became fully
securitized using exceptional speech acts.

Although American militarization6 of Africa has received more attention
in the post-9/11 era as part of the "War on Terror," Africom's origins
can be traced back to the early 1990s when the Pentagon created a
Special Forces Group oriented towards special operations in Africa7 .
[[The **militarization** of Africa must]{.mark} also [be understood as
part of America's global]{.mark} [militarization effort to sustain
its]{.mark} hegemony8 and **[imperial ambitions]{.mark}9**
.]{.underline} Even if presented as preemptive and altruistic (if not
benevolent!), [[American empire is backed by fierce ideology.
This]{.mark} foreign policy [framework claims that America has the right
to define its]{.mark} national security [interests and
**unilaterally**]{.mark} [assert itself in the global arena.]{.mark} The
terrorist attacks of [9/11 drew Africa **closer** to]{.mark} the center
of [American foreign policy]{.mark}]{.underline} because of terrorism
concerns. However, [[America's concern has]{.mark} mainly [been
expressed in terms of further militarization and the creation of
**Africom** to manage it]{.mark}.]{.underline} The George W Bush
administration embarked on a long-term push into several parts of Africa
to counter what it perceived as sprawling inroads made by Al Qaeda and
other terrorist networks operating in poor, lawless, and predominantly
Muslim regions10. [[The US is]{.mark} presently [sending **military
officers** to Africa to bolster intelligence gathering]{.mark} and
sharing, case austere landing strips for emergency use, and secure
greater access and legal protections for American troops in the
region11.]{.underline} In 2002, the Pan-Sahel Initiative (PSI) was
launched in Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger to protect the region's
porous borders, track movements of people, combat terrorism, and enhance
regional stability in these vast and largely uninhabited lands. The US
military equipped and trained each participating country's military
under the auspices of PSI. In 2005 PSI was replaced by [[the
Trans-Saharan Counter-Terrorist]{.mark} [Initiative]{.mark} (TSCTI)
which added Algeria, Morocco, Nigeria, Tunisia, and Senegal to the list
of participants. TSCTI [receives up to \$**100 million** per
year]{.mark} in American funding]{.underline}, instead of the scant
\$6.25 million spent annually on PSI12. [The Department of Defense runs
the Trans-Saraha Initiative]{.underline} which continues PSI's military
training, but also . Similarly, [the East African Regional Security
Initiative (EARSI) was implemented in **East Africa** with the same
goals]{.underline} as TSTCI and [[the East]{.mark} [African
Counter-Terrorism Initiative]{.mark} (EACTI) [was employed]{.mark} in
Kenya and neighboring countries [to train]{.mark} local **[law
enforcement]{.mark}** officers.]{.underline} Since 2002, the US has
stationed between 1,200 and 18,000 troops in Djibouti under the Combined
Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA)13 . Maritime security is
becoming increasingly important. Through Africom's deployment of the
African Partnership Station, [U.S. is building the capacity of West and
Central African states to protect their **territorial waters**, respond
to oil spills and other disasters, and patrol vital oil and gas
platforms14]{.underline}. The Gulf of Guinea and the Gulf of Aden are
areas of particular concern for U.S. maritime protection programs. U[.S.
officers are building the capacity of African armies in order to
**patrol their coastal areas**, improve their intelligence so that
movement of dangerous personnel, arms, money, and other forms of support
coming from the Middle East]{.underline} into the Horn and moving along
the coast of Africa can be blocked15 . In Democratic Republic of Congo,
Liberia, and South Sudan, U.S. is helping to rebuild professional
military forces and is looking to engage in similar Security Sector
Reform (SSR) activities in Somalia16. The International Military
Educational and Training (IMET) Program and the Africa Contingency
Operations Training and Assistance (ACOTA) Programs are ongoing as well.
Over 100,000 African peacekeepers have been trained within these
programs and eight African nations are now in the top 20 of all
contributions to UN peacekeeping operations17. Beyond this military and
civilian capacity building, US is providing logistics support and
equipment to some African countries. ACOTA also focuses on training
trainers and programs tailored to individual country needs, while IMET
programs additionally promotes professionalism and respect for democracy
and human rights18 .

vividly illustrates that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)'s
infamous Counterintelligence Programme, also known as COINTELPRO,
orchestrated operations to "infiltrate, intimidate, imprison, and
assassinate" the leaders of Black movements for social justice in the
US. In Africa, the US executed identical and chronologically aligned
repression through the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) against the
independent African governments and liberation movements sweeping the
continent. **[[No matter where]{.mark} in the world [African]{.mark}
people are, our [organising for social justice is treated as a
threat]{.mark} to the political, economic, [and]{.mark} cultural
interest of the US ruling class that actually constitutes the essence of
Americanism.]{.underline}** Democratically elected leaders of the new
African states were subjected to coup d'états and incessant
assassination attempts including that of Kwame Nkrumahin Ghana, the
successful assassinationof Patrice Lumumba in the Congo, and today we
can add the 2011 brutal murder of Muammar Gaddafi in Libya.
**[[The]{.mark} need to feed a growing and [insatiable
military-industrial complex]{.mark} and to guarantee that no radical
Black movements emerge within US borders or on the African continent
[has given rise to]{.mark} increased and better-coordinated
[militarisation]{.mark} both [in Africa]{.mark} through AFRICOM [and
Black communities in the US]{.mark} through the 1033
Programme.]{.underline}** US state agents continue tantamount treatment,
like spyingon Black Lives Matter activists, monitoringtheir social media
and creating the bogus FBI designation Black Identity Extremiststo
malign them as responsible for violence against police. All the while
tolerating organised, criminal infiltrationof law enforcement by violent
white supremacists. **[[AFRICOM is the]{.mark} US
[response]{.mark}]{.underline}** to economic competition with China and
its increased influence on the continent. AFRICOM is also **[[to]{.mark}
prevent the [emergence of]{.mark} any [independent African
influence]{.mark} or force.]{.underline}** It is not to fight drug
trafficking or terrorism as stated in their promotional materials.
**[The US military presence is a destabilising presence]{.underline}**
demonstrated by events like the 2012 overthrow of a democratically
elected government in Mali by an AFRICOM trainedCaptain Amadou Haya
Sanogo and the 2015 coup in Burkina Faso led by AFRICOM
trainedColonel-Major Gilbert Diendere. During this month
**[the]{.underline} Black Alliance for Peace** **[has been rolling out
its campaign]{.underline} US Out of Africa: Shut Down AFRICOM**urging
all peace and justice loving people to sign the campaign's
petition**[directed to the House Armed Services Committee and the
Congressional Black Caucus. In his last year of office, [instead of
doing what he could to abolish the 1033]{.mark} Programme, [Barack Obama
put ]{.mark}]{.underline}[minor restrictions]{.mark}** **[[on it, which
the Trump administration immediately reversed]{.mark} within its first
year.]{.underline}** The Bush administration, progenitor of AFRICOM, was
rebuked across the African continent when attempting to establish the
headquarters for AFRICOM on the continent, forcing the new command to
work out of Europe. Then came the Obama administration that paved the
way for the proliferation of AFRICOM on the continent, as quisling
African leaders fell over themselves to cooperate with the first Black
US President. A now acceptable scenario has resulted in 46 various forms
of US bases as well as military-to-military relations between almost all
of the 54 African countries and the United States. US Special Forces
troops now operate in more than a dozen African nations reflecting a
1,900 percent increase in the US military presence in Africa. **[What
impact has [increased militarisation]{.mark} abroad had on US Black and
Brown communities? Since 1990, about US \$6 billion worth of US
Department of Defense property [has been]{.mark}]{.underline}
transferred[to local, state, federal and tribal law-enforcement agencies
while communities are suffering from austerity cuts. The world saw this
[deployed against Black rebellions in response to]{.mark} the police
shooting of an unarmed [Michael Brown in Ferguson]{.mark},
Missouri.]{.underline}** The first actual militarisation of the US
police started 28 years before the 1033 Programme in the 1960s with the
creation of the Special Weapons And Tactics units --commonly known as
SWAT. In South Africa (Azania) the same thing was developed at exactly
the same time. The Special Task Force (STF) was an elite police tactical
unit of the white settler regime's South African Police Service (SAPS).
The first significant deployments of SWAT and STF units were to repress
African/Black movements for liberation. On 9 December 1969 SWAT was
deployed for a four-hour confrontation with members of the Black
Panthers in a densely populated area of Los Angeles. In 1967 about 2,000
STF forces were deployed to guard the northern border of Rhodesia
(modern-day Zimbabwe) to assist Rhodesian security forces against the
liberation forces there. Roger Morris, former National Security staffer
for Henry Kissinger, admits that of the dozens of coup d'étatsthat have
taken place in post-colonial Africa only two or three were free of the
hidden hand of US destabilisation. **[The sale of small arms to "Black
Africa" was a policy initiated]{.underline}** through Nixon's National
Security Study Memorandum 201: Increased Arms sales to Black Africa
**[to stop the "threat of communism." Today the conditions they have
created are dishonestly used as the pretext for AFRICOM.]{.underline}**
Likewise in the US, it has been shownthat the rise of so-called street
gangs like the Bloods and Crips reflect a generation of radicalised
youth misguided after a decimated 1960s Black Power movement. In spite
of gun control laws like California's Mulford Actsupported even by the
National Rifle Association to curtail the Black Panther Party's armed
stand to defend the Black community from police terror, **[by the 1980s
semi-automatic weaponry and other sophisticated small arms found its way

outlines]{.mark} a [deliberate]{.mark} and sophisticated [policy of
fostering political divisions between "Black Africa and the US Black
Movement]{.mark}."]{.underline}** Measures like: 1. Specific steps
should be taken with the help of appropriate government agencies to
inhibit coordinated activity of the Black Movement in the United States.
2. Special clandestine operations should be launched by the CIA to
generate mistrust and hostility in American and world opinion against
joint activity of the two forces... 3. US embassies to Black African
countries specially interested in southern Africa must be highly
circumspect in view of the activity ... opposing the objectives and
methods of US policy toward South Africa..." are all arguably what has
been US policy. **[The double standards and hypocrisy of the US
government are clear, making it imperative that the ideological
schizophrenia perpetuated by Americanism is broken. [A]{.mark} mass
[movement must emerge that exposes AFRICOM]{.mark}, confronting the
powers that be about it; [and]{.mark} that [makes it inseparable
from]{.mark} the concerns we have over the [militariatsion in]{.mark}
our [communities in the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates.]{.underline}**
All peace and justice loving people can start by signing the US Out of
Africa! Shut Down AFRICOM petition, spreading it to others and then
getting involved.

#### Best studies prove -- militarizing police forces bad. They disproportionately placed in African American communities, provide no safety benefits, and reputationally hurt local law enforcement agencies.

[[As thousands marched in Ferguson]{.mark}, MO to protest the police
shooting of Michael Brown in 2014, many Americans were surprised and
alarmed by the character of law enforcement's response. For days,
national news networks broadcast images of [armored vehicles, snipers
taking aim at unarmed Black]{.mark} and brown [civilians, and officers
clad in battle armor, deployed]{.mark} by state and local police
agencies (1). To some people, American police appeared to have suddenly
transformed into a wartime occupying force. But to scholars of race and
policing, and perhaps to many citizens of color, these images were less
surprising. More than half a century earlier, James Baldwin described
urban police as "occupying forces" in Black communities (2). And decades
of research in the intervening years have documented the ways in which
policing efforts like "stop and frisk" and the "war on drugs" have
served to maintain race- and class-based social hierarchies (3--6). In
part due to this history, critical race scholars have
characterized]{.underline} [police militarization as another means by
which the state exercises social control over racial minorities
(7).]{.underline} But despite a prolonged and vigorous national debate,
there is little systematic evidence demonstrating the consequences of
militarized police tactics or whether they are more prevalent in
communities of color. Because of heterogeneity in the way thousands of
local law enforcement agencies in the United States document the
presence and activities of their militarized units (if they document
them at all), [[the study of police militarization has been hampered by
data constraints]{.underline}]{.mark} (8, 9). In the absence of
scientific analysis, the arguments of both advocates and critics are
largely informed by anecdotal and journalistic accounts. [Proponents
argue that militarized police units enhance officer safety and deter
violent crime (10), while critics allege that these tactics are
disproportionately applied in the policing of racial minorities
(11--13), potentially eroding the already-anemic levels of trust between
citizens and law enforcement in highly policed communities]{.underline}
(14). The implications of police militarization for civil rights, public
safety, and the exercise of state power depend crucially on the
empirical validity of these claims. [[This study leverages previously
unavailable data to describe]{.mark} the [communities affected by
militarized policing]{.mark} and to estimate its effects on crime,
officer safety, and public perceptions of police. [I first use a rare
census of]{.mark} "special weapons and tactics" ([SWAT]{.mark}) team
[deployments]{.mark} in Maryland to characterize the ways in which
militarized police units are used [and]{.mark} the characteristics of
the communities in which they deploy. I [show that militarized police
units are more often deployed in communities with]{.mark} high
[concentrations of African Americans, a relationship that holds at
multiple levels of geography and]{.mark} even after controlling for
social indicators including [crime rates. I then use a]{.mark}n original
[nationwide panel measuring]{.mark} the [presence of]{.mark} active
[SWAT teams in roughly 9,000 US]{.mark} law enforcement
[agencies]{.mark}, as well as the Maryland SWAT deployment data, to test
whether militarized policing lowers crime rates [and]{.mark} promotes
officer safety. Using within-agency comparisons that greatly mitigate
concerns over omitted variable bias, I [find no evidence that]{.mark}
obtaining or [deploying a SWAT team reduces local crime rates or]{.mark}
lowers [the rates at which officers are killed]{.mark} or assaulted.
Finally, using [survey experiments]{.mark} that randomly assign images
of police officers in news reports, I [show that seeing more militarized
officers]{.mark}---relative to traditionally equipped police---
[can]{.mark} inflate perceptions of crime and [depress support for
police funding and presence]{.mark}. This analysis includes a large
oversample of African American respondents---an important feature given
the high rate at which militarized police units deploy in Black
neighborhoods. On average, militarized police units do not appear to
provide the safety benefits that many police administrators claim. And
police may suffer reputational damage when they deploy militarized
units. These [results suggest that the]{.mark} often-cited [tradeoff
between public safety and civil liberties is]{.mark}, in the case of
militarized policing, [a false choice.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Police militarization is a continuum defined by a combination of
equipment, tactics, and culture that centers on violent conflict (7, 15,
16). [In recent decades, [local police agencies have militarized their
departments]{.mark} to varying degrees, adopting weapons, attire,
tactics, and organizational structures developed for theaters of war.
[The proliferation of militarized policing is due]{.mark} in part [to an
expansion of the war on drugs and federal initiatives that supplied
localities with excess military equipment]{.mark} and funds to purchase
arms]{.underline} (17, 18). Heterogeneity in agency capacity makes it
difficult to precisely code police agencies as "militarized" or not.
Recently publicized data on military gear disbursements have been used
in some studies to estimate the effects of militarization on police
violence, crime, and officer safety (19--21). But these data convey only
the receipt of equipment from one of several programs that help supply
agencies with militarized gear (22). The data also appear incomplete
(see SI Appendix, section 1A for details).

#### Decreases in arms sales create surplus weapons that funnel into domestic militarization.

[Part I traces the key factors that have led to the current level of
police militarization.]{.underline} After a brief explanation of police
militarization\'s historical roots[, this Part uncovers]{.underline} and
performs a critical analysis of [two central factors contributing to its
recent growth]{.underline}: (1) [grants and other assistance to police
departments from multiple federal agencies]{.underline}; and (2)
lobbying by the defense industry and law enforcement. Part II
demonstrates that legal claims relating to the effects of
militarization, principally claims of excessive force, have failed to
provide a remedy for the harms involved in militarized policing. Part
III asserts that a remedy is needed, and explores what that remedy might
be. Part III.A highlights recent examples of militarization to
demonstrate the types of harm involved. Part JJJ.B analyzes the kinds of
solutions that are being proposed, and makes additional recommendations.
This Article asserts that militarization in both tactics and equipment
has led to an escalation in violent encounters between citizens and
police that is not being addressed by the judicial system and that
requires holistic action. [**[With]{.mark}** the **[wars]{.mark}** in
Afghanistan and Iraq [**drawing down** and **defense contractors seeking
new markets**]{.mark},12 **[domestic militarization has undergone an
expansion]{.mark}**, through a process this Article terms the \"green to
blue pipeline.\" [This trend threatens]{.mark} to further erode what was
once a clear [delineation between military and domestic
policing]{.mark}.13]{.underline} The influence of federal and corporate
money on police decisionmaking means that insufficient attention is
given to what local communities actually need. As the juggernaut of
militarization moves forward, the police are at risk of being
transformed from protectors of the community into soldiers fighting a
war against it.

Discussion and Conclusion [Aggressive policing strategies have
historically been disproportionately applied to citizens of color in
ways that serve to preserve race- and class-based social
hierarchies]{.underline} (3). [The normalization of militarized policing
in the United States]{.underline} (15, 16) [has raised
concerns]{.underline} that a new, heavy-handed policing strategy is
being used in similar ways and is eroding public opinion toward law
enforcement, but law enforcement administrators defend the tactics
claiming they can deter violent crime and protect police. [This study
marshals an array of data sources and analytical techniques to
systematically evaluate these claims. Consistent with anecdotal evidence
(11), [militarized police]{.mark} units [are more often deployed in
areas with]{.mark} high [concentrations of African Americans,
even]{.mark} after [adjusting for]{.mark} local crime rates and other
[community traits]{.mark}. But [I find no]{.mark} firm [evidence that
SWAT teams lower]{.mark} an agency's [violent crime rate or]{.mark} the
[rates]{.mark} at which [officers are killed]{.mark} or assaulted. Using
[survey experiments]{.mark}, I [show that citizens react negatively
to]{.mark} the appearance of [militarized police]{.mark} units in news
reports [and become less willing to fund police agencies]{.mark} and
less supportive of having police patrols in their own neighborhoods.
[Given the]{.mark} concentration of [deployments in communities of
color, where trust]{.mark} in law enforcement and government at large
[is already depressed]{.mark} (14, 38), [the routine use of militarized
police tactics]{.mark} by local agencies [threatens to increase]{.mark}
the historic [tensions between marginalized groups]{.mark} [and the
state with no]{.mark} detectable [public safety benefit]{.mark}. While
SWAT teams arguably remain a necessary tool for violent emergency
situations, restricting their use to those rare events may improve
perceptions of police with little or no safety loss.]{.underline}

#### 1033 provides state agencies with surplus DoD equipment -- unnecessarily militarizing police forces.

As many have noted, [[Ferguson]{.underline}]{.mark}, Missouri, currently
[[looks like]{.mark} a [war]{.mark} zone]{.underline}. And its
[police---kitted out with Marine-issue camouflage and military-grade
body armor, toting short-barreled assault rifles, and rolling around in
armored vehicles---[are indistinguishable from
soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline}. America has been quietly arming its
police for battle since the early 1990s. [[Faced with a]{.mark} bloated
military and what it [perceived]{.mark} as a worsening [drug
crisis,]{.mark} the 101st [Congress]{.mark} in 1990 [enacted the
N]{.mark}ational [D]{.mark}efense [A]{.mark}uthorization [A]{.mark}ct.
Section 1208 of [the NDAA allowed the Secretary of Defense to \"transfer

D]{.mark}epartment [o]{.mark}f [D]{.mark}efense, including small arms
and ammunition, that the Secretary determines is--- (A) suitable for use
by such agencies in counter-drug activities; and (B) excess to the needs
of the Department of Defense.\"]{.underline} It was called the 1208
Program. [In 1996, Congress replaced Section 1208 with Section 1033. The
idea was that if the U.S. wanted its police to act like drug warriors,
it should equip them like warriors, which it has---to the tune of around
\$4.3 billion in equipment, according to a report by the American Civil
Liberties Union]{.underline}. The St. Louis County Police Department\'s
annual budget is around \$160 million. [By providing law enforcement
agencies with surplus military equipment free of charge, [the NDAA
encourages police to employ military weapons and military
tactics.]{.mark} 1033 procurements are not matters of public record. And
the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), which coordinates distribution of
military surplus, refuses to reveal the names of agencies requesting
\"tactical\" items, like assault rifles and MRAPs --- for security
reasons]{.underline}, a spokesperson for DLA told Newsweek via email.
One can only trace \"tactical\" items as far the county of the
requesting agency. [[In the case of Ferguson]{.mark}, that means St.
Louis County. [St. Louis]{.mark} County [law enforcement agencies
have]{.mark}, through the 1033 Program, [acquired]{.mark} the following
\"[tactical\" equipment]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to Mike
O\'Connell, Communications Director for the Missouri Department of
Public Safety: [Despite the fact that police in Ferguson have been
photographed with a matte black vehicle which appears to be a
\"Bearcat\" MRAP, [O\'Connell told]{.mark} Newsweek [that no St. Louis

towns in Michigan and Indiana have used the 1033 Program to acquire
\"MRAP armored troop carriers, night-vision rifle scopes, camouflage
fatigues, Humvees and dozens of M16 automatic rifles,\" the South Bend
Tribune reported. And police in Bloomington, Georgia, (population:
2,713) acquired four grenade launchers through the program, The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution reported.

C. Race and Protection [[State protection was administered unequally
along racial lines]{.mark} to safeguard the status quo, effectively
[blocking blacks from economic, social, and political uplift]{.mark}. A
[lack of protection]{.mark} [came to define]{.mark} the [black
experience]{.mark} in the South and throughout the country. Through
selective use of military coercion, the federal government made
vulnerability to violence and exploitation a material disadvantage of
blackness]{.underline}. Critically, [[excluding blacks from]{.mark}
federal [protection was]{.mark} enormously [advantageous to]{.mark} many
[whites]{.mark}. It was [economically]{.mark} beneficial
[because]{.mark}, without intervention, [whites were free to rebuild
an]{.mark} economic and social [order predicated on black
exploitation]{.mark}, including, but not limited to, the system of
sharecropping. [Excluding blacks]{.mark} from federal protection [was
also politically valuabl]{.mark}e to many whites [because whites
could]{.mark} effectively [suppress black voters]{.mark}, ensuring the
political process perpetuated their interest and advantage. Whiteness
was further privileged by government action and inaction. Access to
state protection became a racial marker of whiteness, provided racial
cohesion, and also positioned whites superordinate to
blacks]{.underline}. By examining the historical underprotection of
black life we may better understand the present day. [Across the
country, [black communities are]{.mark} both [overpoliced and
underprotected]{.mark},54 [and]{.mark} police [militarization
strengthens this]{.mark} harmful [paradigm]{.mark}. Law
enforcement-transformed into soldiers and outfitted with battle-ready
equipment-police black communities as war zones. Principles of
militarism, rather than careful and considered intervention, become the
dominant means of addressing social problems in these communities.
Unsurprisingly, violence and the repeated loss of black life is so often
the product of police-community encounters. The exercise of
military-like power by police not only disproportionately subjects
blacks to military-like control, but also fortifies the boundaries
between whiteness and blackness.]{.underline} The spectacles of armored
vehicles on city streets, police in military-style uniform, and officers
wielding submachine guns communicate a need to control certain
communities with excessive force. In the age of paramilitary police
tactics, racial control has become militarized. The following Part
examines police militarization during the Civil Rights Era and its
relationship to the racial politics of protection.

BLACK REVOLT AND POLICE MILITARIZATION DURING THE CIVIL RIGHTS ERA After
the April 2015 uprisings in Baltimore, many made comparisons to the
racial uprisings in the 1960s.55 [I argue that in the context of police
militarization, the most useful lesson from the 1960s is that [the State
responds to racial uprisings by increasing police militarization and
devaluing black lives]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} During the late
1950s and 1960s, many white Americans feared that blacks were \"becoming
increasingly impatient with the status quo and coming ever closer to the
violent \'fire next time\' described by writer James Baldwin.\"5 6
[During the summer of 1965, many white Americans saw their worst racial
nightmares come to fruition [as racial uprisings struck more than one
hundred cities]{.mark} across [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates.57
Rather than address the root and structural causes of black unrest, the
federal government [responded]{.mark} to racial violence during the
1960s [by militarizing]{.mark} the [police under the guise of]{.mark}
restoring [law and order]{.mark}]{.underline}.5 8 [By exploiting racial
fears and casting violence as a breakdown of law and order, government
officials paved the way for increased police militarization. Police
militarization happened slowly, a result of concerted political
decisions 59 that allowed local law enforcement to adopt more of the
characteristics of an army.]{.underline}

C. Setting the Stage for Police Militarization [[The government could
have addressed social inequity as the root cause of]{.mark} the [riots.
Instead]{.mark}, government [officials capitalized on racialized
fear]{.mark} and anxiety [to give]{.mark} the [police more
power]{.mark}, more weapons, and more authority]{.underline}. 94 For
many middle-class whites, racial uprisings in America\'s urban centers
signaled \"a rising criminal class that was increasingly out of
control.\" 95 According to an April 1965 Gallop poll, \"more than half
the country cited race relations as their number-one concern. 96 A poll
of white Americans conducted for Newsweek in 1969 found that \"85
percent of whites thought that black militants were getting off too
easily\... and 66 percent thought that the police needed to be given
more power.\" 97 [Fearing the possibility of more violence, [white
America needed reassurance, and]{.mark} government-facilitated [police
militarization]{.mark} was the panacea offered. [Couched in the rhetoric
of law and order]{.mark}, the federal government [was]{.mark} able to
strengthen the police system through militarization. Advancing police
militarization as [a response to racial uprisings]{.mark} meant
constructing an identity for the protestors that placed them outside of
state protection and in the realm of state threat. Sure enough, the
Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), under the directorship of J.
Edgar Hoover, analyzed racial unrest as a concerted plan between black
militant groups and Communist factions looking to overthrow the U.S.
government.]{.underline} A report from the FBI dated May 29, 1967,98
advised the president that \"\[p\]ropaganda on the part of communists
and other subversives and extremist elements has contributed to Negro
unrest. Demagogues like Martin Luther King, Jr., Stokely Carmichael,
Floyd McKissick, Cassius Clay, and Dick Gregory have added fuel to the
fires of racial discord \.... .\"99 [Not only did the FBI report label
prominent civil rights leaders like Dr. King \"demagogues,\" it also
refers to riot participants as \"young hoodlums\"\-- much like media
reports that characterized marginalized urban youth in Baltimore as
\"thugs.\"]{.underline} 100 [Critically, the report casts racial
uprisings as a clear internal threat to national security and,
accordingly, emphasizes the need for a militarized police response. [The
irony is]{.mark}, viewed from the perspective of many black protestors,
[the riots of the 1960s may be understood as a demand for state
recognition and protection]{.mark}. Across the country, [black
communities were suffering from discrimination in housing, employment,
and education while the government either facilitated unequal conditions
or stood]{.mark} idly [by]{.mark}. Uprisings in urban areas were a
demand for state protection and an end to state-sanctioned black
exploitation. But Hoover\'s response illustrates how **[the black
community was constructed outside of state protection and treated
instead as an internal insurrection]{.mark}**. In responding to racial
unrest, [the FBI emphasized the need for increased cooperation and
communication between the military and police]{.mark} authorities. The
FBI encouraged a \"prompt, efficient, and impressive display of force\"
by the police [and advised every police organization to have a written
plan for riot control]{.mark}. 10 \' These plans included \"steps to be
taken if the riot exceeds the capabilities of the department, which
could be a mutual-aid pact with police of adjacent communities and/or
steps to obtain assistance from the National Guard or Federalized troops
if the riot reached such proportion.\"\' 1 2 The report also read,
\"\[T\]he utilization of military assistance should be effected without
undue delay and the lines of communication should be such that authority
for the use of \[military\] troops could be speedily obtained.\"\'0 3
Thus, if blacks could organize themselves into violent militias with the
aim of disturbing the American social order, then the government would
counter with greater police armament. The militarized response to the
riot also had the more direct effect of marking black communities as the
objects of military-like control. As military personnel patrolled black
neighborhoods with armored trucks and weaponry, the State communicated
its politics of protection. Militarized police control protected white
communities by patrolling black ones. Not only were black communities to
receive no state protection, but the rhetoric of law and order would
also label them an internal threat]{.underline}. Even as the Kerner
Commission\'s report revealed greater attention could be placed on the
substandard conditions of urban ghettos, the government\'s response was
to strengthen its ability to respond to black resistance with
military-style tactics. [[After Watts, a presidential task force]{.mark}
that convened in response to the riots offered a number of official
recommendations]{.underline}, many of which signaled a trend of
increased police-military coordination and armament. [The task force
[recommended enhanced]{.mark} interjurisdictional [police
coordination]{.mark} techniques [and a military liaison system]{.mark}
for metropolitan police departments]{.underline}. 104 The task force
also recommended increased development of riot control equipment for
police utilization and \"a national conference or series of conferences
among police officials for riot prevention and control training.\"10 5
[[Following]{.mark} the [riots, the LAPD took this]{.mark} mandate [to
heart]{.mark}. For top police officials in the LAPD, the riots revealed
that police were unprepared to contain the threat posed by racial
uprisings]{.underline}. LAPD officials turned to the military for
tactical training and guidance. 10 6 The LAPD began \"informally
consulting\" with the Marines and turned to military personnel for
techniques to respond to snipers.\' °7 Embarrassed by its lack of
preparedness during the city\'s unrest, [the LAPD began to cultivate a
new breed of police unit that would adopt military tactics and weaponry.
[What emerged was]{.mark} the first Special Weapons and Tactics
([SWAT]{.mark}) team.]{.underline} °8 [Not surprisingly, [the SWAT
team\'s first target was]{.mark} the Los Angeles chapter of [the Black
Panther Party]{.mark}]{.underline}. On December 6, 1969, a SWAT team
raided the party\'s Los Angeles headquarters,10 9 and after an exchange
of gunfire,110 several members of the Black Panther Party surrendered to
a militarized police force.1 \' [But [this was only the
beginning]{.mark} of SWAT team activity. Soon, police departments across
the country were fighting to replicate the LAPD\'s model. [By
2010,]{.mark} [SWAT \"spread to nearly every city in the
country]{.mark},\"\' 12 [and]{.mark} federal programs [have
equipped]{.mark} them [with]{.mark} [greater amounts of surplus military
equipment]{.mark}.]{.underline} 13 D. Protecting Advantage [The story of
urban unrest in the 1960s can help us analyze police militarization and
racial uprisings today. Today, the proliferation of SWAT teams has come
under increased scrutiny as an unnecessary form of police
militarization. But what we now think of as excessive domestic
militarism was once sold to the American public as an appropriate
response to racial uprisings and black nationalist groups. Indeed,
[excessive showings of force by police were]{.mark} more [readily
accepted when buried in the narrative of white protection]{.mark} and
black threat. The troubling reality is that the justifications for
police militarization then actually reflect many of the justifications
for police militarization now-the dangerous military tactics used by
police are a perfect complement to the dangerous black and brown classes
that are subject to police control. I draw this connection to encourage
critics of police militarization to pay close attention to the rhetoric
emerging from cities like Baltimore and Ferguson. Wherever [the
narrative of \"law and order\" is used to describe black
resistance]{.mark} to the everyday violence of poverty, demilitarization
activists should exercise caution. Indeed, \"law and order\" is a coded
term meant [to reassure white America that its homes]{.mark} and
neighborhoods [will remain within]{.mark} the bounds of [militarized
state protection]{.mark}]{.underline}. Demilitarization activists should
continue to assert that black resistance to police brutality does not
signal a loss of \"law and order.\" Rather, [the real indication of
[lawlessness is government disregard for black life]{.mark} and
opportunity, [laid bare by fatal encounters with]{.mark} the
[police]{.mark}.]{.underline} At the same time, I draw this connection
to make an interrelated claim. Namely, police militarization also
reflects the underprotection of black and brown communities. Urban
uprisings in the 1960s reveal black frustration with conditions in the
inner city. However, [police militarization was a misguided government
response to demands for greater racial equity and resource distribution
between blacks in urban ghettos and the white elite. Blacks wanting
increased state protection from poverty and exploitation were instead
met with greater state repression in the form of militarized
overpolicing. Militarism was again cast as an appropriate response to
social problems. When police organize around the tenets of militarism
and the military model, violence is so often the result of encounters
between law enforcement and the black community. Instead of providing
protection and service, militarized police patrol communities as war
zones, signaling their racial politics of protection. Black communities
are treated as sites of internal insurrection, constructing members of
the community outside the boundaries of citizenship and protection.
Protection is currency, used by the State to strengthen, rather than
dissolve, racial hierarchies.]{.underline}

#### Militarization of police continues despite lower crime rates -- they serve only to increase control of black communities and protect whites, marking blacks as outside of state protection.

The Reality of Police Militarization [Across the country, police
departments are using aggressive military tactics and weapons to enforce
the law.]{.underline} In its June 2014 report, \"War Comes Home,\" the
American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) documented military weaponry
flooding into local police departments. 155 [[State]{.mark} and local
[agencies have purchased hundreds of]{.mark} lethal [weapons]{.mark},
[tactical]{.mark} vests, [and body armor at no]{.mark} [cost and
with]{.mark} virtually [no public oversight through]{.mark} the
Department of Defense\'s [1033]{.mark} Program]{.underline}.156 The ACLU
report found a total of 15,054 items of battle uniforms, or personal
protective equipment, received by sixty-three responding agencies during
their investigation period. 157 Five hundred law enforcement agencies
have received Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles built to
withstand armor-piercing roadside bombs. In 2007, \"the United States
spent \$50 billion to produce 27,000 MRAPs and deploy them to Iraq and
Afghanistan.\"\'1 58 Now out of date, or no longer needed in foreign
battlefields, MRAPs have made their way to local police departments
where officers patrol communities like war-zones. [In addition to the
proliferation of military weapons throughout local law enforcement
departments, [police training also exposes aspiring officers to]{.mark}
the culture of [militarism]{.mark} that now permeates the force.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice\'s Bureau of Justice
Statistics Report on State and Local Law Enforcement Training Academies
(BJS Report), the majority of police recruits receive their training in
academies with a stress-based military orientation]{.underline}. 159
[Stress-based military [training is designed to prepare young
recruits]{.mark} for combat in war zones [by]{.mark} teaching [recruits
to force the enemy into submission]{.mark}]{.underline}. As one police
trainer put it, \"We trainers have spent the past decade trying to
ingrain in our students the concept that the American police officer
works a battlefield every day he patrols his sector.\"\' 60 [[This
training does not prepare recruits to win community trust]{.mark} by
solving crimes and protecting constitutional rights]{.underline}. 161
[In this logic, [police officers are transformed into soldiers, and
black and brown communities morphed into battlefields. Military-style
tactics are also becoming conventional]{.mark} police strategies. [One
of the clearest manifestations]{.mark} of military-style tactics
[is]{.mark} the rise of [SWAT teams]{.mark}. A survey of police
departments across the country reveals that \"the number of SWAT teams
in small towns grew from 20 percent in the 1980s to 80 percent in the
mid-2000s, and that as of the late 1990s, almost 90 percent of larger
cities had them.\"]{.underline}\' 62 It is estimated that \"the number
of SWAT raids per year grew from 3,000 in the 1980s to 45,000 in the
mid-2000s.\"\' 163 [Contrary to popular belief that [SWAT teams are
utilized]{.mark} in active shooter and emergency situations, a report
conducted by the University of Missouri-St. Louis\'s Department of
Criminology and Criminal Justice found that from 1986 to 1998 \"the
overwhelming number of SWAT deployments studied were [for the purpose of
executing a warrant]{.mark} (34,271 for warrant service, in contrast to
7,384 for a barricaded suspect and 1,180 for hostage-taking cases).\' \'
164 [Many]{.mark} of these SWAT [teams used flash-bang grenades, combat
helmets, and battle-dress uniforms to serve search warrants]{.mark},
conduct investigations, and search [for
drugs]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} 165 [The proliferation of
paramilitary policing has occurred with great speed and little public
oversight. This culture of [paramilitarism in policing has been
particularly costly to minority communities]{.mark} and led to
unnecessary loss of life. [In Detroit]{.mark}, the killing of a black
child, [seven-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones,]{.mark} drew national
attention]{.underline}. Early one summer morning, [Aiyana [slept beside
her grandmother when]{.mark} [a SWAT team mistakenly raided her
home]{.mark} searching for a suspect in a homicide investigation. [One
officer fired at Aiyana]{.mark}, striking her head and [killing
her]{.mark}]{.underline}.\' 66 Many were outraged at the senseless
murder of an innocent child in what appeared to be a military raid
fueled by a combat mentality. Many also condemned the excessive use of
force that unfairly targeted the black community in Detroit. [This
[disproportionate use of military force against black and brown
communities has been observed]{.mark} [nationwide]{.mark}. The ACLU
found that the use of paramilitary weapons and tactics primarily
impacted people of color, [particularly]{.mark} when these tactics were
[used to execute drug searches]{.mark}]{.underline}. 167 [Ultimately,
police were much more likely to deploy paramilitary tactics to execute a
search warrant if all the participants were people of color]{.underline}
(84 percent deployment rate) [than when all the participants were white
(]{.underline}65 percent deployment rate). 1 Acknowledging that military
policing, and policing more broadly, disproportionately impacts black
and brown people, [this Note has looked beyond the racial impacts of
this phenomenon to examine its racialized roots. Government-sanctioned
police militarization is just part of the story in Ferguson, Baltimore,
and countless other cities across the country. By centering on questions
of race, we can begin to understand what work race does in facilitating
police militarization.]{.underline} [At the same time, we may also
understand how police militarization constructs race and reinforces
racial hierarchies in America. When analyzing the contemporary state of
police militarization, [we must]{.mark} first [disassociate police
militarization from actual notions of crime]{.mark}. Some people view
increased police militarization as evidence that police work has become
more dangerous. Proponents of this argument often see increased police
armament as a response to an upsurge in dangerous crime. In fact, [since
the mid-1990s the job of police officers has become increasingly
safer]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is as safe today as it has ever been. 69
[[The number of officer deaths]{.mark} in 1975 more than [halved by
2014, despite]{.mark} many [more]{.mark} police [officers]{.mark} on the
street.\' 70]{.underline} [[Rates of violent crime have also reduced
significantly]{.mark}]{.underline} since the mid-century. [The year 2013
saw nearly 9,000 fewer homicides, about 27,000 fewer rapes, and about
368,000 fewer aggravated assaults than 1991.]{.underline}71 [This
reduction occurred [when the country\'s population increased]{.mark} by
sixty-four million people.]{.underline} 72 This means that [[police
militarization has continued without a]{.mark} logical [connection to
increased risk]{.mark} to police officers. Rather than a response to
increases in violent crime, police militarization can be viewed as a
state-sanctioned form of racemaking. As the federal government funnels
military equipment and training into local police departments, it
enables the presence of tanks on city streets, networks of surveillance
cameras surreptitiously patrolling entire communities,\' 73 and even
assault weapons and grenade launchers in public schools]{.underline}.1
74 Even if the official police mandate is to protect and serve all
people, the current state of policing is such that black and brown
communities are subject to greater surveillance and control. Unlike poor
and minority communities, many white communities experience policing of
a different nature. [Rather than patrol white communities with
suspicion, police are often dispatched to white communities to provide
security and assistance-this unequal access to security is a key element
of the racial politics of protection. [Police militarization has the
dual impact of increasing]{.mark} state [control of black and brown
people while]{.mark} simultaneously [increasing protections for
white]{.mark} people. Militarized policing creates more opportunities
for the surveillance of black and brown bodies in the communities where
they live, work, socialize, and attend school. This heightened control
is not a result of the inherent dangerousness of these groups or of any
enhanced risk to police officers that has accumulated over time. Rather,
government programs have made black and brown people vulnerable to
militarized control based on the color of their skin. This is a material
disadvantage of being black or brown-a racial marker.]{.underline} Most
importantly, [[the images of]{.mark} black neighborhoods patrolled by
tanks and armored vehicles in [Ferguson and Baltimore clearly demarcate
who is outside of state protection]{.mark}. As in the 1960s, rather than
focus on the substantive grievances of marginalized groups, the State
treats these groups as an internal insurrection]{.underline}. When black
communities are patrolled with weapons built to subdue foreign enemies,
this communicates something about the citizenship status of black
people-that their status is inferior, that they are dangerous, and that
they are somehow outside the American polity. At the same time, an
absence of images depicting white communities locked down by militarized
police conveys white position within the realm of state protection.
White people are treated as full citizens, worthy of status.

#### Discussion needs to start from the racial underpinnings of police militarization -- which is inextricably tied to US wars abroad.

CONCLUSION [This Note critically examines history to shed light on
police militarization today. It argues that [police militarization is a
result of]{.mark} concerted political decisions that often trade on
[racial fear and anxiety]{.mark}. Further, [the]{.mark} present [state
of]{.mark} police [militarization on display in cities]{.mark} like
Ferguson and Baltimore [reinforces racial hierarchies]{.mark} and may
have lasting consequences for black citizenship and
inclusion.]{.underline} I conclude with a reflection that I hope will
strengthen and solidify the movement for racial justice and police
accountability sweeping this nation. [Black Americans have an important
stake in antiwar and antimilitarization campaigns. The line between the
military and police is blurring, and this means that [black and brown
communities are poised to be victims of]{.mark} intensified,
[military-like police control, while]{.mark} remaining [severely
underprotected by the State]{.mark}. Both nationally and globally,
freedom from military control is also a material advantage of whiteness
that too often goes unacknowledged.]{.underline} Mainstream America is
increasingly scrutinizing the expansion of police militarization,
especially in the areas of domestic surveillance. [With highprofile
whistleblowers like Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning, the victims of
heightened state control now have white faces. There is ground for an
alliance of interest across racial groups, but the American mainstream
must first acknowledge that police militarization has been facilitated
by racist ideologies. [We must]{.mark} also [reject conversations that
ignore]{.mark} [the racial underpinnings of police
militarization]{.mark}. To neglect race is to neglect one of the driving
forces behind police militarization. [I]{.mark} also [want to]{.mark}
conclude with a [call for]{.mark} activists and [scholars to
explore]{.mark} the critical [intersections of race, foreign wars, and
militarization]{.mark}. There are many ways that these three social
forces shape everyday life in this country]{.underline}, and I am
increasingly aware that my own life trajectory has been intimately
shaped by all three. I was born in Khartoum, Sudan. Most of my family
belongs to a small but well-known indigenous tribe found in the
northeast part of the country along the banks of the Nile River. In the
1960s, as a result of the construction of the Aswan Dam, much of my
family was displaced. The Aswan Dam flooded parts of the Nubian region
and prevented the annual inundation of the Nile that provided valuable
nutrients to the soil. Many will also recognize Sudan as a site of
consistent political strife and military campaigns. One of those
campaigns was the twenty-five-year Civil War between Southern Sudanese
liberation fighters and the Northern Sudanese government. Racist
ideology further complicated the dimensions of this war because many
Northern tribes are significantly lighter skinned than the Southern
tribes and received material advantages from the British colonial
empire. The war, and its impact on the country, was one of the primary
reasons my father and mother decided to leave Sudan and immigrate to the
United States. In a pre-9/11 world, my father was granted political
asylum, which involved battling an incredibly racialized immigration
process. I was four years old at the time, a black female, a Muslim, and
a new immigrant. Through implicit ands explicit signals, I quickly
caught on to the importance of my racial identity in my new home, but it
was not until after 9/11 that I began to unpack the connection between
my life trajectory and the wars and military campaigns that shaped it.
When the United States went to war with Afghanistan and declared its
socalled War on Terror, I felt like the country had declared war on the
entire Muslim world. I knew many Muslims and immigrants who condemned
the war, but virtually none of my black friends, teachers, and community
members spoke out. Looking back on this experience, I see how bifurcated
my young mind must have felt. I knew this war deeply impacted my ethnic
and religious identity, but I could not understand how the war impacted
my racial identity. I include this story to lay bare my motivations for
this Note. For me, this particular Note is a means of mending that
bifurcation, of putting together that which has been falsely severed.
[[As the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [continues to beat the drums of
war across the globe, those]{.mark} of us [at the intersection of
marginalized groups should shine]{.mark} a [light on the
dangerous]{.mark} and impoverished [logic of wars abroad and at
home.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Trump rescinded restrictions on 1033 which is disproportionately used against Black people.

**Interamerican Commission On Human Rights '18** ("African Americans,
Police Use of Force, and Human Rights in the United States;" doc 156;
November 26; OEA/SER L/V/II; db)

Information provided to the Commission indicates that many [local
[police departments]{.mark} in the U.S. [have]{.mark} [become heavily
militarized]{.mark} in recent decades,]{.underline}[^1] [[and
that]{.mark} the [use of military-type equipment]{.mark} in SWAT
("Special Weapons and Tactics") raids and similar operations [is
disproportionately targeted against]{.mark} historically [marginalized
groups]{.mark}.]{.underline}[^2] A recent study by the ACLU found that
[[42 percent of people impacted]{.mark} by a SWAT deployment to execute
a search warrant [were Black]{.mark} and 12 percent were Latino; [of
deployments]{.mark} in which all individuals impacted were minorities,
[68 percent were drug cases]{.mark}, and 61 percent of all individuals
impacted by SWAT raids in drug cases were members of historically
discriminated groups.]{.underline}[^3] [Additionally, [79 percent of
incidents]{.mark} the ACLU studied [involved]{.mark} the [use of a SWAT
team to search]{.mark} a person's home, and more than 60 percent of the
cases involved searches for drugs]{.underline}.[^4] According to the
ACLU, [U.S. policing has become unnecessarily and dangerously
militarized, and in municipalities with greater amounts of military
equipment, police officers acted more aggressively and adopted a
"warrior" mindset, rather than seeing themselves as protectors of a
community.]{.underline}[^5] [On May 18, 2015, President Barack [Obama
announced]{.mark} new [restrictions on the transfer of military
equipment to]{.mark} local [police departments, in]{.mark} [light of
concerns about]{.mark} the policing of [protests]{.mark} in Ferguson,
Missouri and Baltimore, Maryland, among others.]{.underline}[^6] This
Executive Order (EO 13688) created a federal agency working group to
oversee and implement protocols around military weapons provided to
police by the federal government.[^7] At that time, the move was greeted
with optimism.[^8] [On August 28, 2017, President Donald [Trump
rescinded]{.mark} EO 13688, removing [those restrictions]{.mark} on the
transfer and oversight of military equipment]{.underline}.[^9] In 2015,
the Commission noted that a principal concern regarding the excessive or
arbitrary use of force by law enforcement in the U.S. is the
"militarization" of police in terms of the equipment, training,
protocols used, and the difficulty of prosecuting and establishing
criminal responsibility for police officers guilty of abuse or excessive
use of force.[^10] The Commission notes with concern reports that with
the revocation of EO 13688, police departments will once again receive
armed vehicles, high-caliber weapons and ammunition, grenades,
camouflage uniforms, and other military equipment,[^11] raising concerns
about a possible increase in the excessive use of force and policing of
protest situations that does not comply with international law.[^12]
[[This is]{.mark} particularly [concerning in light]{.mark} of
information received by the Commission that the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) recently concluded [that the Pentagon does
not verify the quantity of]{.mark} military [weapons transferred
through]{.mark} the [1033]{.mark} program, and that the DOD "lacks
reasonable assurance that it has the ability to prevent, detect, and
respond to potential fraud and minimize associated security
risks."]{.underline}[^13] The Commission calls on the State to take the
necessary steps to halt and reverse the militarization of police
departments, as well as to further study and take corrective action in
light of the racially disproportionate effect of militarized policing on
African Americans and other historically marginalized groups.

#### African American resistances has responded to with police militarization, surveillance, and restrictions to constitutional rights.

**Interamerican Commission On Human Rights '18** ("African Americans,
Police Use of Force, and Human Rights in the United States;" doc 156;
November 26; OEA/SER L/V/II; db)

120\. [The Commission has received information about disproportionate
police responses to protests and about the excessive policing of African
American protesters]{.underline}. In particular, [events during protests
in Ferguson, Missouri highlight a number of cross-cutting issues in this
report, including issues of non-discrimination, excessive force, and
police militarization. The Commission notes information indicating that
many of the concerns expressed below in the context of Ferguson are
generalized in the U.S.; in this respect, it notes the observation of
the U.N. Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful
assembly and of association on complaints of police use of excessive
force to arbitrarily arrest protesters for minor acts, such as stepping
off crowded sidewalks, overwhelming police presence at protests and
other of intimidation, and targeting for arrest and abuse on the basis
of race or ethnicity]{.underline}. 121. [During its on-site visit in
Ferguson, the Commission received information about protests after the
killing of Michael Brown in August 2014 and the announcement of the
decision not to indict Darren Wilson, the white officer responsible for
his death, on November 24, 2014, and strong public criticism of the
police response to these protests. At least 212 individuals were
reportedly arrested during the protests, the majority on charges of
"refusal to disperse." The IACHR received reports of excessive use of
tear gas and violence against African Americans as a mechanism of
control and/or dispersal, even during peaceful protests, arbitrary
detention of protesters, and disrespect of places identified as
safe-houses, including places of worship, during protests.]{.underline}
The delegation was concerned by allegations that Ferguson police
deliberately ignored white protesters and focused on the arrest and use
of force against black protesters during protests. 122. The imposition
of restrictions on the right to protest, including curfews and
designated protest areas, as well as restrictions on the presence and
range of action of the media and legal and human rights observers at
protests may also have a chilling effect on freedom of expression.
[Indeed, [a federal court]{.mark} later [found that the enforcement of a
"keep walking/five-second rule" during protests]{.mark} in Ferguson,
under which demonstrators constantly had to keep moving during the
protests or face arrest, [was unconstitutional]{.mark}.]{.underline}
123. At a public hearing on racism in the U.S. criminal justice system,
a participant from the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law
stated: Instead of having their complaints and concerns heard, lawful
protestors \[in Ferguson, Missouri\] have been met with a harsh
militarized response by local and state police forces. They have been
jailed without cause, beaten unconscious, blinded by tear gas and pepper
spray, and had their human and constitutional rights violated every day
with all kinds of pronouncements on new policies and curfews. [Sadly,
this is not the first time and will not be the last time that
[police]{.mark} abuse [targeting communities of color, unlawfully
killing unarmed black men, or suppressing lawful protest]{.mark} will
occur. [This experience has become]{.mark} the new [normal throughout
the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates.]{.underline} 124. [[In]{.mark}
November [2014]{.mark}, new [protests broke out]{.mark} across the
country [at]{.mark} the decision of a grand jury not to indict the
police officer responsible for Michael [Brown's death]{.mark}. In
California, [at least 180 people were]{.mark} reportedly
[arrested]{.mark} in protests. [In December]{.mark}, New York
[police]{.mark} reportedly [arrested at least 200 people during protests
against]{.mark} the decision of a grand jury not to indict the officer
responsible for [the death of Eric Garner]{.mark}. Most of the arrests
of the demonstrators were made on charges of disorderly conduct and
refusal to disperse. 125. [Protests]{.mark} in Ferguson after the
killing of Michael Brown also [highlighted the concerning level of
militarization of]{.mark} municipal [police]{.mark}, leading to a
federal review of programs that supply military equipment to police
departments. [During]{.mark} those [protests]{.mark}, reports indicated
that [police used armored vehicles]{.mark}, noise-based [crowd control
devices,]{.mark} [shotguns, M-4 rifles]{.mark}, rubber bullets, [and
tear gas. The use of]{.mark} riot gear and [military-grade weapons
in]{.mark} peaceful demonstrations may also be a form of [intimidation
of protesters]{.mark} who are practicing their right to peaceful
assembly, and [can cause]{.mark} the [escalation]{.mark}, rather than
de-escalation, [of violence]{.mark}. 126. [In]{.mark} April [2015,
protests]{.mark} in Baltimore and around the country [occurred after the
death of]{.mark} 25-year-old [Freddie Gray]{.mark} due to a spinal cord
injury while in police custody. [At least 486 people were]{.mark}
reportedly [detained]{.mark} in the protests. On April 27, 2015, [the
governor of Maryland]{.mark} declared a state of emergency and ordere[d
the National Guard]{.mark} to be deployed. At least 100 people were
arrested in New York in protests there.]{.underline} According to
reports, assaults and arrests of journalists by the police were recorded
during the protests. [The Mayor of Baltimore also ordered a curfew that
was in effect from April 28 until May 3. The curfew, which was enforced
citywide, did not apply to journalists, military personnel, and police,
who were able to move about freely in the city between 10:00 p.m. and
5:00 a.m., while movement for all other citizens was
restricted]{.underline}. 127. The Commission notes reports that police
responses to protests, as well as the relationship between the community
and police, appear not to have improved in Ferguson since the 2014
protests and subsequent DOJ investigation. In September 2017, thousands
in Ferguson protested the acquittal of a police officer in the 2011
killing of Anthony Lamar Smith, an unarmed black man. [Media reports
indicated that [police officers mocked protesters while conducting mass
arrests]{.mark} by using the common protest chant "Whose streets? Our
streets!" [and displayed an overwhelming]{.mark} and [militarized
presence in response to]{.mark} the [protests]{.mark}, provoking a
former DOJ investigator to observe, "You can't legislate
goodwill."]{.underline} The Commission notes recent reports that the DOJ
has opened an investigation into St. Louis Police conduct during these
protests. 128. [Finally, the Commission highlights with concern
information received related to the [increased surveillance of racial
justice activists by]{.mark} domestic law enforcement [agencies like the
FBI,]{.mark} as well as the denomination of these groups as "Black
Identity Extremists." The Commission notes that the stigmatization of
anti-racism activists [is not]{.mark} a [new]{.mark} phenomenon in the
U.S.; [during]{.mark} the civil rights movement of [the 1960s,
activists]{.mark} like the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and members
of the Black Panther Party [were]{.mark} similarly [targeted by the
FBI's "Cointelpro"]{.mark} ("counterintelligence program"). The
Commission notes that, among other deleterious effects of increased
surveillance of racial justice movements, [this surveillance]{.mark}
also [has the effect of increasing the likelihood that its targets will
be]{.mark} stigmatized and [criminalized, exposing]{.mark} its [targets
to]{.mark} the [increased risk of violence]{.mark} (e.g. in the context
of raids), [and chilling free speech and freedom of assembly]{.mark}.
129. In light of the foregoing, the Commission calls on the State to
guarantee the rights to freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, and
in particular to ensure their enforcement without discrimination on the
basis of race or other prohibited grounds.]{.underline}

#### Militarized police increase safety risks and undermine rights.

Police Use of Force, and Human Rights in the United States;" doc 156;

237\. [The Commission is concerned by the level of militarization of
local police forces in the United States, as well as by recent
information that [steps taken to decrease militarization]{.mark} at the
federal level [are being reversed]{.mark}.]{.underline} In particular,
[the Commission observes that the use of military-grade tools and
tactics by local police forces escalates the risk of excessive force and
undermines respect for human rights. The use of [violent tactics and
military equipment increases]{.mark} the [risk of]{.mark} bodily harm,
including [injury and death]{.mark}]{.underline}. 238. The Commission
notes that [militarized policing is not simply a matter of appearance,
nor does the use of military-style tactics and equipment simply
undermine community trust. Rather, it may violate the principles of
necessity and proportionality under international law. When used in the
context of peaceful protests, [militarized police tactics]{.mark} may
[undermine the rights to]{.mark} freedom of [expression,
association]{.mark} and [assembly, and]{.mark} the right [to take part
in]{.mark} the conduct of [public affairs]{.mark}. The Commission has
stated that the police and armed forces are entrusted with substantively
different missions and members of the respective forces are trained for
those very different missions; accordingly [there should be a clear
distinction between]{.mark} [internal security]{.mark} and law
enforcement as the function of the police [and national defense as the
function of the armed forces.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### States should act without delay to resolve discrimination and violence against African Americans. 

**Interamerican Commission On Human Rights '18 ("African Americans,
Police Use of Force, and Human Rights in the United States;" doc 156;
November 26; OEA/SER L/V/II; db)**

251\. [[States are obligated to]{.mark} organize their
governments---federal, state, and local---and, in general, all the
structures through which public power is exercised, including the
State's legislative framework, public policies, law enforcement
machinery, and judicial system, to [ensure]{.mark} the full [enjoyment
of]{.mark} human [rights of all persons]{.mark} subject to their
jurisdiction. Under international human rights law, the State has the
non-derogable [obligation to respect the right to life and]{.mark}
prevent torture. This obligation gives rise, in turn, [to]{.mark} the
obligation to [act with due diligence]{.mark} to protect human
rights.]{.underline} This requirement encompasses four basic
obligations: prevention, investigation, punishment, and reparation and
non-repetition of human rights violations. [The failure of the State to
carry out this duty, even where the perpetrators are third parties, may
amount to State action that gives rise to international
responsibility]{.underline}. The Commission has consistently invoked the
due diligence principle as a benchmark to rule on cases and situations
of racism and other forms of intolerance. 252. The Commission has
addressed the scope of the United States' obligation to guarantee the
rights of at-risk persons or groups on various occasions, examining the
differential impact that widespread practices of discrimination and
violence by State agents or non-State actors have had on certain social
groups, including African Americans. 253. [There is a strong link
between discrimination, violence, and due diligence.]{.underline} For
example, the Commission has found on various occasions that a State's
failure to act with due diligence to protect women from violence
constitutes a form of discrimination, and denies women their right to
equality before the law. [[The State is obligated not only to abstain
from violating rights and act with due diligence]{.mark} to prevent
particular acts of violence, [but also to remedy an underlying situation
of discrimination]{.mark} and injustice]{.underline}. 254. [The
Commission has interpreted the duty to act with due diligence toward
situations of structural violence, such as gender-based violence against
women, broadly, encompassing not only the prompt investigation,
prosecution, and punishment of these acts, but also the obligation "to
prevent these degrading practices."]{.underline} For example, in Jessica
Lenahan v. United States, the Commission highlighted that "the State's
duty to address violence against women also involves measures to prevent
and respond to the discrimination that perpetuates this problem." Thus,
"States must adopt the required measures to modify the social and
cultural patterns of conduct of men and women and to eliminate
prejudices, customary practices and other practices based on the idea of
the inferiority or superiority of either of the sexes, and on
stereotyped roles for men and women." Furthermore, [the Commission has
previously considered that "the existence of a general pattern of State
tolerance and judicial inefficiency towards cases of domestic violence
\[promotes\] their repetition, and reaffirm\[s\] the inextricable link
between the problem of violence against women and discrimination in the
domestic setting." 255. [In the case of violence]{.mark} and
discrimination [against African Americans]{.mark}, the Commission has
previously considered [the need for]{.mark} the federal and state
[governments to]{.mark} take steps "with due diligence and [without
delay to address the context which fuels]{.mark} forms of [structural
discrimination]{.mark} and disparate treatment against African Americans
and racial minorities in the United States," considering that [this
context is a key]{.mark} contributing factor to police violence against
African Americans, and that remedying this underlying discrimination is
"vital for the full exercise of citizenship by African Americans and [to
foster]{.mark} a [more inclusive democracy]{.mark} in the United
States." Indeed, historic, structural discrimination against African
Americans is the "backbone" of many of the problems discussed in this
report. 256. In light of the foregoing, the Commission considers that a
State's failure to act with due diligence to prevent violence against
African Americans constitutes a form of discrimination and a denial of
equality before the law. The State has a positive duty to prevent and
respond to the underlying discrimination that perpetuates the commission
of police violence against African Americans. The Commission has
previously emphasized that [it is]{.mark} [essential]{.mark} not only to
appropriately investigate, prosecute, and punish cases of police
violence, but also "[to modify]{.mark} \[...\] [institutionalized
stereotypes towards Afro-descendant\[s\]"]{.mark} in order to fulfill
its duties [to]{.mark} [prevent]{.mark} and eradicate
[discrimination]{.mark}. 257. There is an important link between the
duty of due diligence and the obligation of States to guarantee access
to adequate and effective judicial remedies for victims and their family
members when they suffer acts of violence.]{.underline} Finally, it is
important to keep in mind the role of intersectional factors (e.g.
sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, color,
ethnicity, national origin, immigration status, religion, disability,
situation of poverty, situation of homelessness, and others) that may
place certain African Americans and other individuals of color at
particular risk of violence or discrimination by State or non-State
actors.

###  General

#### The right to assemble precedes any other right granted to the people -- sovereignty through assembly is critical to withdraw from and question illegitimate structures that don't act in the name of the people

**Butler '18** (Judith Butler, writes comparative literature on gender
theory and is a gender theorist who works at UC Berkeley, Hannah Arendt
Chair at the European Graduate School, Developed the theory on Gender
Performativity, LGBTQ activist, "Notes Toward A Performative Theory of
Assembly", First Harvard University Press paperback edition published in

[That assembly may be called ["the people]{.mark}" or it may be one
version of "the people"]{.underline}---they do not speak in one voice or
even in one language. But [they [are beings with the capacity to move
with]{.mark} [whatever]{.mark} technical and infrastructural [supports
they require to do so]{.mark}]{.underline} (this is, importantly, an
insight from disability studies that has concrete implications for
thinking through public assembly). And that means that [they can resolve
to stand still, not to move, even to become immoveable in their desires
and their demands.]{.underline} [[The power to move]{.mark} or be still,
to speak and to act, [belongs to the assembly prior to]{.mark}, and in
excess of, [whatever rights a particular government decides to
confer]{.mark} or to protect. The [coming together]{.mark} of a crowd
[has]{.mark}]{.underline}, as John Inazu contends, "[[an expressive
function]{.mark}" prior to any particular claim or utterance it may
make.4 [That]{.mark} very power of [government may]{.mark} well [become
what freedom of assembly opposes]{.mark}]{.underline}, and at that
moment, [we see the operation of a form of [popular sovereignty]{.mark}
that [is distinct from state sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline}, and whose
task it is to distinguish itself from the latter. How, then, do we think
about the freedom of assembly and popular sovereignty? I know that some
people have come to consider "sovereignty" a bad word, one that
associates politics with a singular subject and a form of executive
power with territorial claims. Sometimes it is used as synonymous with
mastery, and other times with subordination. Perhaps it carries other
connotations, though, that we would not want to lose altogether. One
only needs to consider debates about native sovereignty in Canada or
read the important work of J. Kēhaulani Kauanui on the paradoxes of
Hawaiian sovereignty to see [how crucial this notion can be for popular
mobilizations.5 [Sovereignty can be one way of describing]{.mark} acts
of [political self-determination]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is why
[popular [movements]{.mark} of indigenous people struggling for
sovereignty [have become important]{.mark} ways to lay claim to space,
[to move]{.mark} freely, to express one's views, and [to seek]{.mark}
reparation and [justice]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although elections are the
way that government officials are supposed to represent popular
sovereignty (or the "popular will" more specifically), [the meaning of
popular sovereignty has never been fully exhausted by the act of
voting.]{.underline} Of course, voting is essential for any concept of
popular sovereignty, but [the exercise of sovereignty neither begins nor
ends with the act of voting]{.underline}. As democratic theorists have
argued for some time, elections do not fully transfer sovereignty from
the populace to its elected representatives---something of [popular
sovereignty always remains nontransferable,]{.underline} marking the
outside of the electoral process. If not, there would be no popular
means of objecting to corrupt electoral processes. In a sense, [[the
power of the populace remains separate from]{.mark} the power of [those
elected]{.mark}]{.underline}, even after they have elected them, for
only in its separateness can it continue to contest the conditions and
results of elections as well as the actions of elected officials. [If
the sovereignty of the people is fully transferred to, and replaced by,
those whom the majority elect, then what is lost are those powers we
call critical, those actions we call resistance, and that lived
possibility we call revolution]{.underline}. So "popular sovereignty"
certainly translates into electoral power when the people vote, but that
is never a full or adequate translation. Something [of popular
[sovereignty]{.mark} remains untranslatable, nontransferable, and even
unsubstitutable, which is why it [can both elect and dissolve
regimes]{.mark}]{.underline}. As much as popular sovereignty legitimates
parliamentary forms of power[[, it also retains the power to withdraw
its support from those]{.mark} same [forms when they prove to be
illegitimate.]{.mark}]{.underline} If parliamentary forms of power
require popular sovereignty for their very legitimacy, they also surely
fear it, for [there is something about popular sovereignty that runs
counter to, and exceeds or outruns, every parliamentary form that it
institutes and grounds. An \[[A]{.mark}\] elected [regime can be]{.mark}
brought to a halt or [overcome by that assembly of people who speak "in
the name of the people]{.mark}," enacting the very "we" that holds final
legitimating power under conditions of democratic rule]{.underline}. In
other words, the conditions of democratic rule depend finally on an
exercise of popular sovereignty that is never fully contained or
expressed by any particular democratic order, but which is the condition
of its democratic character. This is an extraparliamentary power without
which no parliament can function legitimately, and that threatens every
parliament with dysfunction or even dissolution. We may again want to
call it an "anarchist" interval or a permanent principle of revolution
that resides within democratic orders, one that shows up more or less
both at moments of founding and moments of [[dissolution]{.mark}, but
[is]{.mark} also [operative in the freedom of assembly]{.mark}
itself]{.underline}.

#### The right to have rights predates, and is independent from, any political institution- Those excluded from sovereign structures can weaponize the right to appear in order to combat criminal regimes of the law-While the public sphere is built on exclusion and regulated modes of disavowal, performing the right to appear allows assemblages to call the state's legitimacy into question- the body's performance against state forces solidifies one's right to persist, a right not guaranteed by the law but rather the right to have rights 

**Butler '18** (Judith Butler, writes comparative literature on gender
theory and is a gender theorist who works at UC Berkeley, Hannah Arendt
Chair at the European Graduate School, Developed the theory on Gender

Luckily, I think [Arendt]{.underline} did not consistently follow this
model from The Human Condition, which is why, for instance, in the early
1960s, she [turned again to [the fate of refugees and the
stateless]{.mark}, and came [to assert in a new way the right to have
rights]{.mark}]{.underline}.9 **[[The right to have rights is one that
depends on no existing particular political organization for its
legitimacy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Like the space of appearance, [the
right to have rights]{.mark} predates and [precedes any political
institution that might codify]{.mark} or seek [to guarantee that
right]{.mark}]{.underline}; at the same time, [it is derived from no
natural set of laws]{.underline}. **[[The right comes into being when it
is exercised]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and exercised **[[by those who
act]{.mark} in concert, [in alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Those who
are excluded from existing polities, who belong to no nation-state
or]{.mark} other contemporary [state formation]{.mark}, may be deemed
"unreal"]{.underline} only by those who seek to monopolize the terms of
reality. And yet, [even after the public sphere has been defined through
their exclusion, **they act**]{.underline}. [[Whether they are abandoned
to precarity or left to die through systematic negligence, concerted
action still emerges from their acting together]{.underline}]{.mark}.
And this is what we see, for instance, [when [undocumented workers amass
on the street without the legal right to do so]{.mark}]{.underline};
when squatters lay claim to buildings in Argentina as a way of
exercising the right to livable shelter; when populations lay claim to a
public square that has belonged to the military; [when [refugees take
part in collective uprisings demanding shelter, food, and rights of
sanctuary]{.mark}]{.underline}; [when [populations amass, without the
protection of the law and without permits to demonstrate, to bring down
an unjust or criminal regime of law]{.mark} or to protest
austerity]{.underline} measures that destroy the possibility of
employment and education for many. [Or when those whose public
appearance is itself criminal]{.underline}---transgendered people in
Turkey or women who wear the veil in France---[appear in order to
contest that criminal status and assert the right to
appear.]{.underline} The French law that prohibits "ostentatious"
religious display in public as well as the hiding of the face seeks to
establish a public sphere where clothing remains a signifier of
secularism and the exposure of the face becomes a public norm. [[The
prohibition]{.mark} against hiding the face [serves a]{.mark} certain
[version of the right to appear]{.mark}, understood as [the right for
women to appear unveiled]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [At the same
time, it denies the right to appear for that very group of women,
requiring them to defy religious norms in favor of public
ones]{.underline}. That required act of religious disaffiliation becomes
obligatory when the public sphere is understood as one that overcomes or
negates religious forms of belonging. The notion, prevalent in French
debate, that women who wear the veil cannot possibly do so from any
sense of choice operates in the debate to veil, as it were, the blatant
acts of discrimination against religious minorities that the law enacts.
For one choice that is clearly made among those who wear the veil is not
to comply with those forms of compulsory disaffiliation that condition
the entrance to the public sphere. Here as elsewhere, [the sphere of
appearance is highly regulated]{.underline}. [That these women be
clothed in some ways rather than others constitutes a sartorial politics
of the public sphere, but so too does compulsory "unveiling," itself a
sign of belonging first to the public]{.underline} and only secondarily,
or privately, to the religious community. This is especially pronounced
in relation to Muslim women whose affiliations to various versions of
public, secular, and religious domains may well be coterminous and
overlapping. [And it shows quite clearly that what is called ["the
public sphere"]{.mark} in such cases [is built up through constitutive
exclusions and compulsory forms of
disavowal]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} **[Paradoxically, the act of
[conforming to a law that requires unveiling is the means by which
a]{.mark} certainly highly compromised, even [violent, "freedom to
appear" is established]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Indeed, in the public
demonstrations that often follow from acts of public mourning---as often
occurred in Syria before half of its population became refugees, where
crowds of mourners became targets of military destruction---we can see
how [[the existing public space is seized by those who have no existing
right to gather there]{.mark}, who emerge from zones of disappearance to
become bodies [exposed to violence and death in the course of gathering
and persisting publicly as they do]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [it is
their right to gather, free of intimidation and the threat of violence,
that is systematically attacked by the police, the army, hired gangs, or
mercenaries. [To attack those bodies is to attack the right itself,
since when those bodies appear and act, they are exercising a
right]{.mark}]{.underline} outside, against, and in the face of the
regime. Although [[the bodies on the street are vocalizing their
opposition to the legitimacy of the state]{.underline}]{.mark}, [they
are also, by virtue of occupying and persisting in that space without
protection, posing their challenge in corporeal terms, which means that
when the body "speaks" politically, it is not only in vocal or written
language.]{.underline} The persistence of [[the body in its exposure
calls that legitimacy into question and does so precisely through a
specific performativity of the body]{.underline}]{.mark}.10 Both action
and gesture signify and speak, both as action and claim; the one is not
finally extricable from the other. **[[Where the legitimacy of the state
is brought into question]{.mark} precisely by that way of appearing in
public, [the body]{.mark} itself exercises a right that is no right; in
other words, it [exercises a right that is being actively contested and
destroyed by military force and]{.mark} that, in its resistance to
force, [articulates its way of living, showing both its precarity and
its right to persist]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [[This right]{.mark} is
codified nowhere]{.underline}. [It [is not granted]{.mark}]{.underline}
from elsewhere or [[by]{.mark} existing [law]{.mark}, [even if it
sometimes finds support]{.mark} precisely [there. It is]{.mark}, in
fact, [the right to have rights]{.mark}]{.underline}, not as natural law
or metaphysical stipulation, but [as the persistence]{.underline} of the
body [[against those forces that seek its]{.mark}]{.underline}
debilitation or [[eradication]{.underline}]{.mark}. This persistence
requires breaking into the established regime of space with a set of
material supports both mobilized and mobilizing.

#### Protesting it good even if it doesn't result in change - increase visibility of a cause, demonstrate power of the people, tell politicians what citizens feel (even if they don't do anything), and build coalitions of care

**Head '19** (Tom Head, author, served on the board of the Mississippi
ACLU, May 23, 2019, "Why Protest Events Are Not a Waste of Time",
<https://www.thoughtco.com/why-protest-events-are-important-721459>,
Accessed: 07/06/2019, KW)

At first glance, the long-standing American practice of street
protesting seems very odd. Picking up a picket sign and spending hours
chanting and marching in 105-degree heat or 15-degree frost are not
ordinary things to do. In fact, such behavior outside the context of a
protest might be viewed as a sign of mental imbalance. The history of
protest in the U.S. and around the world, however, reveals the abundant
good this tradition has done for democracy and the democratic process.
The U.S. Bill of Rights enshrines the right to peaceful assembly,
evidence that the importance of protest has been recognized since the
founding of this nation. [But [why is protest]{.mark} so
[useful]{.mark}?]{.underline} [[Increasing the Visibility of a
Cause]{.mark} Policy debates can be abstract and may even seem
irrelevant to the people not most directly affected by them. In
contrast, [protest events]{.mark} put warm bodies and heavy feet out
into the world, representing an issue. Protest marchers [are real people
showing that they care enough]{.mark} about their cause [to go out and
be ambassadors for it.]{.mark} Marches bring attention. The media,
politicians, and bystanders notice when a protest event happens. And
[if]{.mark} the [protest is staged well, it will invariably make some
people look at the issue with new eyes. Protests]{.mark} are not
persuasive in and of themselves, but they [invite conversation,
persuasion, and change]{.mark}.]{.underline} Demonstrating Power The
date was May 1, 2006. The U.S. House of Representatives had just passed
H.R. 4437, a bill that essentially called for the deportation of 12
million undocumented immigrants and the imprisonment of anyone who might
help them avoid deportation. A massive group of activists, predominantly
but not exclusively Latino planned a series of rallies in response. More
than 500,000 people marched in Los Angeles, 300,000 in Chicago, and
millions more throughout the country; several hundred even marched in
Jackson, Mississippi. The death of H.R. 4437 in committee was not
surprising after these actions. [[When large numbers of people take
to]{.mark} the streets in [protest, politicians]{.mark} and other key
decision-makers [notice]{.mark}. There is [no guarantee]{.mark} that
[they will act, but they notice]{.mark}. Promoting a Sense of Solidarity
You may or may not feel that you are part of a movement even if you
happen to agree with its principles. Supporting LGBTQIA rights in the
comfort of your own home is one thing, but picking up a sign and
supporting the issue in public is another matter: you let the issue
define you for the duration of the protest, and you stand together with
others to represent a movement. [Protests make the movement feel more
real to participants]{.mark}.]{.underline} This gung-ho spirit can also
be dangerous. \"The crowd,\" in the words of Søren Kierkegaard, \"is
untruth.\" To quote the musician and songwriter Sting, \"people go crazy
in congregations / they only get better one by one.\" To guard against
the danger of mob thinking as you become emotionally engaged in an
issue, remain intellectually honest about it, however challenging that
might be[. [Building Activist Relationships]{.mark} Solo activism isn\'t
usually very effective. It can also become dull very quickly. [Protest
events give activists a chance to meet, network, swap ideas, and build
coalitions and community]{.mark}. For many protests, [activists form
affinity groups, where they find allies]{.mark} for the very specific
angle most important to them. Many activist organizations started out at
protest events that united and networked their like-minded
founders.]{.underline} Energizing Participants Ask almost anyone who
attended the March on Washington in August 1963, and to this day
they\'ll tell you exactly what it felt like. Good protest events can be
spiritual experiences for some people, charging their batteries and
inspiring them to get up and fight again another day. Such fortification
is, of course, very helpful in the difficult process of working for a
cause. By creating newly committed activists, and giving veteran
activists a second wind, this energizing effect is a crucial ingredient
in the struggle for political change.

#### The conception of individualism ignores the obligation that individuals have towards each other -- every inhabitant does not only belong to communities but also the world itself -- we all have a commitment to each other and a right to a livable life through the aff's new form of politics

Most scholars would want to keep any consideration of [Emmanuel
Levinas]{.underline} separate from an analysis of Hannah Arendt: He [is
a philosopher of ethics]{.underline}, drawing on religious traditions,
[and]{.underline} he [emphasizes the ethical importance of passivity and
receptivity]{.underline}; she [\[Arendt\] is a social and political
philosopher]{.underline}, adamantly secular, who emphasizes time and
again the political value of action. Why bring a discussion of Levinas
together with one regarding Arendt? [Both [Levinas and Arendt take issue
with]{.mark} the [classically liberal conception of
individualism]{.mark}]{.underline}, that is, the idea that
[[individuals]{.underline}]{.mark} knowingly [[enter
into]{.underline}]{.mark} certain contracts, [and [their
obligation]{.mark} follows [from having deliberately]{.mark} and
volitionally [entered into agreements with one
another]{.mark}]{.underline}. This view assumes that we are only
responsible for those relations, codified by agreements, into which we
have knowingly and volitionally entered. And Arendt disputes this view.
Indeed, it was the substance of the argument that she made against Adolf
Eichmann. He thought he could choose which populations should live and
die, and in this sense he thought he could choose with whom to cohabit
the earth. What he failed to understand, according to Arendt, is that
[[no one has the prerogative to choose with whom to cohabit the
earth]{.underline}]{.mark}. We can choose in some ways how and where to
live, and in local ways we can choose with whom to live. But if we were
to decide with whom to cohabit the earth, we would be deciding which
portion of humanity may live and which may die. If that choice is barred
to us, that means that we are under an obligation to live with those who
already exist, and that [any choice about who may or may not live is
always a genocidal practice]{.underline}; and though we cannot dispute
that genocide has happened, and happens still, [we are wrong to think
that freedom in any ethical sense is ever compatible with the freedom to
commit genocide]{.underline}. The unchosen character of earthly
cohabitation is, for Arendt, the condition of our very existence as
ethical and political beings. Hence, to exercise that prerogative of
genocide is not only to destroy political conditions of personhood but
to destroy freedom itself, understood not as an individual act but as a
plural action. Without that plurality against which we cannot choose, we
have no freedom and, therefore, no choice. This means that [[there is an
unchosen condition of freedom]{.mark} and [that]{.mark}, in being free,
[we affirm something about what is unchosen for us]{.mark}.]{.underline}
If freedom seeks to exceed that unfreedom that is its condition, then we
destroy plurality and we jeopardize, in her view, our status as persons,
considered as zoon politikon. This was one argument that Arendt made
about why the death penalty was justified for Eichmann. In her view,
Eichmann had already destroyed himself by not realizing that his own
life was bound to those he destroyed, and individual life makes no
sense, has no reality, outside of the social and political framework in
which all lives are equally valued.3 In Eichmann in Jerusalem (1963),
Arendt argues that Eichmann and his superiors failed to realize that
[the [heterogeneity of]{.mark} the [earth's population is an
irreversible condition of social and political life]{.mark}]{.underline}
itself.4 So Arendt's accusation against Eichmann bespeaks a firm
conviction that none of us may exercise such a prerogative, that those
with whom we cohabit the earth are given to us, prior to choice and so
prior to any social or political contracts we might enter into through
deliberation and volition. In Eichmann's case, the effort to choose with
whom to cohabit the earth was an explicit effort to annihilate some part
of the population---Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, communists, the
disabled, and the ill, among others---and so the exercise of freedom
upon which he insisted was genocide. Not only is this choice an attack
on cohabitation as a precondition of political life in Arendt's view,
but it commits us to the following proposition: we must devise
institutions and policies that actively preserve and affirm the unchosen
character of open-ended and plural cohabitation. Not only do we live
with those we never chose and with whom we may feel no immediate sense
of social belonging, but we are also obligated to preserve those lives
and the open-ended plurality that is the global population. [Although
Arendt would doubtless dispute my view]{.underline}, I think what [she
has offered is an ethical view of cohabitation that serves as a
guideline for particular forms of politics]{.underline}. In this sense,
concrete political norms and policies emerge from the unchosen character
of these modes of cohabitation. The necessity of cohabiting the earth is
a principle that, in her philosophy, must guide the actions and policies
of any neighborhood, community, or nation. The decision to live in one
community or another is surely justified as long as it does not imply
that those who live outside the community do not deserve to live. In
other words, [every communitarian ground for belonging is only
justifiable on the condition that it is subordinate to a
noncommunitarian opposition to genocide.]{.underline} The way I read
this, **[[every inhabitant who belongs to a community belongs also to
the earth]{.underline}]{.mark}**---a notion she clearly takes from
Heidegger---and **[[this implies a commitment not only to every other
inhabitant of that earth but]{.mark}, we can surely add, [to sustaining
the earth itself]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And with this last proviso, I
seek to offer an ecological supplement to Arendt's anthropocentrism. In
Eichmann in Jerusalem, Arendt speaks not only for the Jews but for any
and every other minority who would be expelled from habitation on the
earth by another group. The one implies the other, and the "speaking
for" universalizes the founding interdiction even as it does not
override the plurality whose life it seeks to protect. One reason
[Arendt]{.underline} refuses to separate the Jews from the other
so-called nations persecuted by the Nazis is that she [is arguing in the
name of a plurality coextensive with human life in any and all of its
cultural forms]{.underline}. At the same time, her judgment of Eichmann
is one that emerges precisely from the historical situation of a
diasporic Jew who was herself a refugee from Nazi Germany, but who also
objected to the Israeli courts representing a specific nation, when the
crime, in her view, was a crime against humanity, and to [the
courts]{.underline} representing [only the Jewish victims of the
genocide, when there were many other groups annihilated and
displaced]{.underline} in accord with the Nazi policy formulated and
implemented by Eichmann and his cohorts. [[This same notion of unchosen
cohabitation implies]{.mark}]{.underline} not only the irreversibly
plural or heterogeneous character of the earth's population, and [[an
obligation to safeguard that plurality]{.underline}]{.mark}, but
[[also]{.mark} a commitment [to an equal right to inhabit the
earth]{.mark} and so a commitment to equality as well]{.underline}.
These two dimensions of her discussion took specific historical form in
her argument against the idea of Israel as a state based on principles
of Jewish sovereignty and for a federated Palestine in the late 1940s.
The political conception of plurality for which she fought was, in her
view, implicit in the American Revolution, and it led her to refuse to
accept exclusively national, racial, or religious grounds for
citizenship. Moreover, [[she objected to the founding of any state that
required the expulsion of its inhabitants]{.mark} and the production of
a new refugee class, especially [when such a state invoked the rights of
refugees to legitimate its founding]{.mark}.]{.underline} Arendt's
normative views are these: [**[there is no one part of the population
that can claim the earth for itself, no community or nation-state or
regional unit, no clan, no party, and no race]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
This means that unwilled proximity and unchosen cohabitation are
preconditions of our political existence, the basis of her critique of
nationalism, the obligation to live on the earth and in a polity that
establishes equality for a population necessarily and irreversibly
heterogeneous. Indeed, unwilled [proximity]{.underline} and unchosen
cohabitation also [serve as the basis of our [obligation]{.mark}s not to
destroy any part of the human population and to outlaw
genocide]{.underline} as a crime against humanity, [but also [to invest
institutions with the demand to seek to make all lives
livable]{.mark}]{.underline} and equally so. Thus, from unchosen
cohabitation, [[Arendt derives notions of universality and equality that
commit us to institutions that seek to sustain human lives without
regarding]{.underline}]{.mark} some part of [[the population as socially
dead]{.underline}]{.mark}, as redundant, or as intrinsically unworthy of
life and therefore ungrievable. Arendt's views on cohabitation,
federated authority, equality, and universality, elaborated from the
1940s through the 1960s, stood in stark contrast to those who were
defending nationalist forms of Jewish sovereignty, differential
classifications for Jewish and non-Jewish citizens, military policies to
uproot Palestinians from their lands, and efforts to establish a Jewish
demographic majority for the state. It is often taught that Israel
became a historical and ethical necessity for the Jews during and after
the Nazi genocide, and that anyone who questions the founding principles
of the Jewish state shows an extraordinary insensitivity to the plight
of the Jews; but [there were Jewish thinkers and political activists at
the time, including Arendt, Martin Buber, Hans Kohn, and Judah Magnes,
who thought that [among the most important lessons of the Nazi genocide
was an opposition to]{.mark} illegitimate state violence, to [any state
formation that sought to give electoral priority and citizenship to one
race or religion]{.mark}, and that nation-states ought to be
internationally barred from dispossessing whole populations who fail to
fit the purified idea of the nation.]{.underline} For those who
extrapolated principles of justice from the historical experience of
internment and dispossession, [[the political aim is to extend equality
regardless of cultural background or formation]{.underline}]{.mark},
across languages and religions, to those none of us ever chose (or did
not recognize that we chose) [and]{.underline} with whom **[[we have
an]{.underline}]{.mark}** enduring **[[obligation to find a way to
live]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For whoever "we" are, we are also those who
were never chosen, who emerge on this earth without everyone's consent,
and who belong, from the start, to a wider population and a sustainable
earth. And **[[this condition]{.underline}]{.mark}**, paradoxically,
[[yields]{.mark} the [radical potential for new modes of sociality and
politics beyond the]{.mark} avid and wretched [bonds formed through
settler colonialism and expulsion]{.mark}]{.underline}. [We are
all]{.underline}, in this sense, the unchosen, but we are nevertheless
[unchosen together]{.underline}. It is not uninteresting to note that
Arendt, herself a Jew and refugee, understood her obligation not to
belong to the "chosen people" but, rather, to the unchosen, [and to make
mixed community precisely among those whose **[existence implies a right
to exist and to lead a livable life.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### Precarity gains intelligibility exclusively when recognizing bodily dependence, human needs, and vulnerability as political issues- because conditions which determine livable life are intrinsically tied to concrete political institutions so too must the solutions we generate be grounded in notions of material precarity- this is the only ethical strategy to combat genocide and sustain life.

ARENDT'S EURO-AMERICAN FRAMEWORK was clearly limited, and yet another
limitation becomes clear if we try to understand the relationship of
precarity to practices of cohabitation. For Arendt, the needs of the
body are to be relegated to the private sphere. [[Precarity]{.mark} only
[makes sense if we are able to identify bodily dependency]{.mark} and
[need, hunger]{.mark} and the [need for shelter,]{.mark} the
[vulnerability to injury and destruction, forms of social trust that let
us live]{.mark} and thrive, [and]{.mark} the [passions linked to
our]{.mark} very [persistence as]{.mark} clearly [political
issues]{.mark}.]{.underline} If Arendt thought that such matters had to
be relegated to the private realm, [Levinas]{.underline} understood the
importance of vulnerability but [failed to really link vulnerability to
a politics of the body]{.underline}. Although Levinas seems to
presuppose a body impinged upon, he does not give it an explicit place
in his ethical philosophy. And though [Arendt theorizes the problem of
the body, of the located body, [the speaking body emerging into the
"space of appearance" as part of any account of political
action]{.mark}, she is not quite willing to affirm a politics that
struggles to overcome inequalities in food distribution, that affirms
rights of housing, and that targets inequalities in the sphere of
reproductive labor]{.underline}. In my view, some ethical claims emerge
from bodily life, and perhaps [all ethical claims presuppose a bodily
life]{.underline}, understood as injurable, one that is not
restrictively human. After all, the life that is worth preserving and
safeguarding, that should be protected from murder (Levinas) and
genocide (Arendt), is connected to, and dependent upon, nonhuman life in
essential ways; this follows from the idea of the human animal, as
Derrida has articulated it, which becomes a different point of departure
for thinking about politics. [[If we try to understand]{.mark} in
concrete terms [what it means to commit ourselves to preserving the life
of the other]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[we are]{.underline}]{.mark}
invariably [[confronted]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the bodily conditions of
life and]{.underline} so to [[a commitment]{.underline}]{.mark} not only
to the other's corporeal persistence but [[to all those environmental
conditions that make life livable.]{.mark}]{.underline} In the so-called
private sphere delineated in Arendt's The Human Condition, we find the
question of needs, the reproduction of the material conditions of life,
and the problems of transience, reproduction, and death
alike---everything that pertains to precarious life. [[The possibility
of whole populations being annihilated through]{.mark} either [genocidal
policies or systemic negligence follows]{.mark} not only [from]{.mark}
the fact that there are [those who believe that they can decide with
whom they will inhabit the earth]{.mark}, but also because such thinking
presupposes a disavowal of an irreducible fact of politics:]{.underline}
the vulnerability to destruction by others that follows from [a
condition of precarity in all modes of political and social
interdependency.]{.underline} We can make this into a broad existential
claim, namely, that everyone is precarious, and this follows from our
social existence as bodily beings who depend upon one another for
shelter and sustenance and who, therefore, are at risk of statelessness,
homelessness, and destitution under unjust and unequal political
conditions. As much as I am making such a claim, I am also making
another, namely, that [[our precarity is]{.mark} to a large extent
[dependent upon the organization of economic and social relationships,
the presence]{.mark} or absence [of]{.mark} sustaining infrastructures
and [social and political institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}. So as soon
as the existential claim is articulated in its specificity, it ceases to
be existential. And since it must be articulated in its specificity, it
was never existential. In this sense, [[precarity is indissociable from
that dimension of politics that addresses the organization and
protection of bodily needs]{.underline}]{.mark}. Precarity exposes our
sociality, the fragile and necessary dimensions of our interdependency.
Whether explicitly stated or not, [every political effort to manage
populations involves a tactical distribution of precarity]{.underline},
more often than not articulated through an unequal distribution of
precarity, [one that depends on dominant norms regarding whose life is
grievable and worth protecting and whose life is
ungrievable]{.underline}, or marginally or episodically grievable, and
so, in that sense, already lost in part or in whole, and thus less
worthy of protection and sustenance. [[My point is not to rehabilitate
humanism but]{.underline}]{.mark}, rather, [[to struggle for a
conception of ethical obligation that is grounded in
precarity]{.underline}]{.mark}. No one escapes the precarious dimension
of social life---it is, we might say, the joint of our nonfoundation.
And [[we cannot understand cohabitation without understanding that a
generalized precarity obligates us to oppose genocide and to sustain
life]{.mark} on egalitarian terms.]{.underline} Perhaps this feature of
our lives can serve as the basis for the right of protection against
genocide, whether through deliberate or negligent means. After all, even
though our interdependency constitutes us as more than thinking beings,
indeed as social and embodied, vulnerable and passionate, [our thinking
gets nowhere without the presupposition of the interdependent and
sustaining conditions of life.]{.underline}

###  Vulnerability

#### Injection and embracement of precarity is key to stop the re-entrenchment of this violence towards those deemed vulnerable and prevent self-defeating movements -- the body's vulnerability, once exposed by regimes of power, allows for the mobilization of mass political resistance

**Butler '18** (Judith Butler, writes comparative literature on gender
theory and is a gender theorist who works at UC Berkeley, Hannah Arendt
Chair at the European Graduate School, Developed the theory on Gender
Performativity, LGBTQ activist, "Notes Toward A Performative Theory of

That [[action]{.underline}]{.mark}, I would suggest, [[has to be
supported through solidarity]{.underline}]{.mark}, to be sure, [[but
also by infrastructural conditions, by law]{.mark}, and by the absence
of violent or coercive efforts to thwart the way]{.underline}. The
struggles I mentioned above presume that bodies have been constrained
and are at risk of constraint, that they can be without work and without
mobility, that they can suffer violence and forms of coercion. Am I
trying to say that bodies are not active, but vulnerable? Or that even
vulnerable bodies can act? My argument, in fact, is that [[it would be
as mistaken to think of the body as primarily or definitionally active
as it would be to think of the body as primarily and definitionally
vulnerable and inactive]{.underline}]{.mark}. If we have to have a
definition, it will [depend]{.underline}, rather, [on being able to
think vulnerability and agency together.]{.underline} I am especially
aware of how counterproductive it can be to understand women's bodies as
particularly vulnerable. We immediately enter into uncertain terrain,
given the long and lamentable gender politics that allocates the
distinction between passive and active to women and men, respectively.
Yet, [[if we say that certain groups are differentially vulnerable, we
are only saying that under certain regimes of power, some groups are
targeted more readily than others]{.underline}]{.mark}, some suffer
poverty more than others, some are exposed to police violence more than
others. We are making a sociological observation that would have to be
backed up in one way or another. And yet, [that sociological claim can
very easily become a new norm of description]{.underline}, at which
point women become defined by their vulnerability. At such a point,
[[the very problem that the description is meant to address becomes
reproduced and ratified by the very]{.mark} description]{.underline}.
This is one reason we have to pay attention to what it means to mobilize
vulnerability, and what it means, more specifically, to mobilize
vulnerability in concert. For many of us, that is, for many people, the
moment of actively appearing on the street involves a deliberate risk of
exposure. Perhaps the word "exposure" helps us think vulnerability
outside the trap of ontology and foundationalism. This is especially
true for those who, exposed, appear on the street without permits, who
are opposing the police or the military or other security forces without
weapons. Although one is shorn of protection, to be sure, one is not
reduced to some sort of "bare life." There is no sovereign power
jettisoning the subject outside the domain of the political as such; on
the contrary, there is a more varied and diffuse operation of power and
force that detains and encroaches on bodies in the street or in the cell
or on the periphery of towns and borders---[and this is a specifically
political form of destitution.]{.underline} Of course, feminist
theorists have for a long time argued that women suffer social
vulnerability disproportionately.9 And though there is always a risk in
claiming that women are especially vulnerable---given how many other
groups are entitled to make the same claim, and given that the category
of women is intersected by class, race, age, and a number of other
vectors of power and sites of potential discrimination and
injury---there is still something important to be taken from this
tradition. The claim can sometimes be taken to mean that women have an
unchanging and defining vulnerability, and that kind of argument makes
the case for paternalistic provisions of protection. [If women are
regarded as especially vulnerable and seek protected status, it becomes
the responsibility of the state or other paternal powers to provide that
protection.]{.underline} According to that model, [feminist
activism]{.underline} not only petitions paternal authority for special
dispensations and protections, but affirms that inequality of power that
situates women in a powerless position and, by implication, men in a
more powerful one. And where it does not simply or exclusively put "men"
in the position of providing protection, it [invests state structures
with the paternalistic obligation to facilitate the achievement of
feminist goals. Such a view is very different from one that
claims]{.underline}, for instance, that women are at once vulnerable and
capable of resistance, and that [vulnerability and
resistance]{.underline} can, and do, and even [must happen at the same
time]{.underline}, as we see in certain forms of feminist self-defense
and institutions (battered women's shelters, for example) that seek to
provide protection without enlarging paternalistic powers, and as
happens through networks that support trans women in Turkey or anywhere
the expanded and expandable category of women suffers harassment or
injury by virtue of appearing as it does. Of course, there are good
reasons to argue for the differential vulnerability of women; they
suffer disproportionately from poverty and illiteracy, two very
important dimensions of any global analysis of women's conditions (and
two reasons why none of us will be "postfeminist" until such time as
these conditions are fully overcome). But many of the feminists who have
made the turn to vulnerability, as it were, have done so in order to
increase the protected standing of women in human rights organizations
and international courts. This juridification of the feminist project
seeks to prioritize the language needed to strengthen such an appeal to
the courts. [As important as such [appeals]{.mark} may be, they [provide
a limited language for]{.mark} understanding feminist forms of
resistance that are popular and extralegal, **the [dynamics of mass
movements, civil society initiatives, and forms of political
resistance]{.mark} informed and [mobilized by vulnerability. The need to
establish a politics that avoids the retrenchment of paternalism seems
clear]{.mark}. At the same time, [if this resistance to paternalism
objects to all state and economic institutions]{.mark} that provide
social welfare, [then the demand for infrastructural support
becomes]{.mark} illegible within its terms, even
[self-defeating]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Hence, this task is made all the
more difficult under conditions of increasing precarity in which ever
greater numbers of people are exposed to homelessness, unemployment,
illiteracy, and inadequate health care. [The struggle, in my view, is
how to make the feminist claim effectively that such institutions are
crucial to sustaining lives at the same time that feminists resist modes
of paternalism that reinstate and naturalize relations of
inequality.]{.underline} So though the value of vulnerability has been
important to feminist theory and politics, this does not mean that
vulnerability serves as a defining characteristic of women as a group.
[I would oppose this effort to install a new norm for the category of
women that rests on a foundational notion of vulnerability]{.underline}.
Indeed, the very debate about who belongs to the group called "women"
marks a distinct zone of vulnerability, namely, those who are
non--gender conforming, and whose exposure to discrimination,
harassment, and violence is clearly heightened on those grounds. So some
provisionally bound group called "women" is neither more vulnerable than
a provisionally bound group called "men" nor is it particularly useful
or true to try to demonstrate that women value vulnerability more than
men do. Rather[, certain kinds of gender-defining attributes, like
[vulnerability and invulnerability, are distributed unequally under
certain regimes of power]{.mark}, and precisely for the purpose of
shoring up certain regimes of power that disenfranchise
women]{.underline}. We think about goods as distributed unequally under
capitalism as well as natural resources, especially water, but we should
also surely consider that one way of managing [populations]{.underline}
is to [distribute vulnerability unequally such that "[vulnerable
populations" are established within discourse and
policy]{.mark}]{.underline}. More recently, we note that [social
[movements and]{.mark} policy [analysts refer to precarious populations,
and that political strategies are accordingly devised to think about
ameliorating conditions of precarity]{.mark}.10 But [this]{.mark} same
[demand is]{.mark} also [made through broad popular struggles]{.mark}
that both expose and mobilize precarity, [showing]{.mark}]{.underline},
as it were, **[[the possibilities of performative political action that
emerge in the midst of precarity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It seems clear
that **[[if the designation of vulnerability or precarity effaces this
form of political demand, it further entrenches the very condition from
which it seeks alleviation.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### Certain populations are deemed disposable and therefore subject to violence- our political transformation is a balance between personal responsibilities and the idea of vulnerability- this resolves the assumption that anything which is met with retaliation elicits vulnerability

**Butler '18** (Judith Butler, writes comparative literature on gender
theory and is a gender theorist who works at UC Berkeley, Hannah Arendt
Chair at the European Graduate School, Developed the theory on Gender
Performativity, LGBTQ activist, "Notes Toward A Performative Theory of

There is of course an even more sinister way of wielding both categories
of precarity and of vulnerability. Within the terms of both military and
economic policy, [[certain populations are]{.mark} effectively [targeted
as]{.mark} injurable]{.underline} (with impunity) [or
[disposable]{.mark}]{.underline} (living on in a disposable condition or
no longer living, quite literally disposed of, a distinction that
constitutes an interval in the time-space of social death).
[[This]{.mark}]{.underline} kind of explicit or implicit marking [[is
used to justify]{.mark} the [infliction of injury upon]{.mark} such
[populations]{.mark}]{.underline} (as we see in times of war, or in
state violence against undocumented citizens). So "[vulnerability" can
be a way of targeting a population for decimation]{.underline}. This has
produced a paradox within neoliberalism and its notion of
"[[responsibilization]{.underline}]{.mark}" that [[designates such
populations as accountable for their own precarious
position]{.underline}]{.mark}, or their accelerated experience of
precaritization. [As a counter to this nefarious form of
moralizing]{.underline}, human rights advocates have defended [[the idea
of vulnerability]{.underline}]{.mark} as they [[insist on the need for
legal and institutional protection for such groups]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The notion of [[vulnerability]{.mark} here works in two ways, to target
a population or to protect it, which means]{.underline} that [the term
has been used to [establish a restrictive political logic]{.mark}
according [to which being targeted and being protected are the only two
alternatives]{.mark}]{.underline}. We can see that [[the
term]{.underline}]{.mark}, so deployed, effectively [[effaces both
popular movements]{.underline}]{.mark} (if not forms of popular
sovereignty) [[and]{.mark} active struggles for [resistance and social
and political transformation]{.mark}.]{.underline} We may think that
these two ways of using the notion of vulnerability are antithetical,
and they are, but only within the terms of a problematic logic, one that
displaces some other forms of political rationality and practice that
are arguably more pressing and more promising. So targeting and
protecting are practices that belong to the same rationale of power. [If
precarious populations have produced their own situation, then they are
not situated within a regime of power that reproduces precarity in
systemic ways]{.underline}. Their own actions, or their own failures,
are the cause of their precarious situations. If they are seen as in
need of protection, and if paternalistic forms of power (which sometimes
do include philanthropy and humanitarian NGOs) seek to install
themselves in permanent positions of power to represent the powerless,
then [those very populations are excluded from democratic processes and
mobilizations.]{.underline} [[The answer to this dilemma is neither to
position precarious populations as hyperresponsible]{.mark} on a moral
model [nor]{.mark}, conversely, [to position them as suffering
populations]{.mark} in need of "care" by good Christians]{.underline}
(as the social democratic discourse in France, with its implicit
affiliation with Christian values, currently maintains). [**[This
approach takes vulnerability and invulnerability as political
effects]{.underline}**,]{.mark} unequally distributed effects of a field
of power that acts on and through bodies; these swift inversions show
that [vulnerability and invulnerability are]{.underline} not essential
features of men or women, but, rather, processes of gender formation,
[the effects [of modes of power]{.mark} that have as one of their aims
the production of gender differences along lines of
inequality]{.underline}. We can see evidence of this rationale when, for
instance, [[masculinity is said to be "attacked" by
feminism]{.underline}]{.mark}---in which case [[it is masculinity in the
"vulnerable" position]{.underline}]{.mark}---or [[when the general
public is said to be "attacked" by sexual and gender
minorities]{.underline}]{.mark} of various kinds, or when the state of
California is now understood to be "under attack" because it has lost
its white majority, or when the state of Arizona is said to be "under
attack" by its Latino population, and so trying to establish an ever
more impermeable border to the south. Various European nationalities are
now said to be "under attack" by new immigrant communities, at which
point dominant groups and their racist representatives are construed as
occupying a vulnerable condition.

#### Vulnerability can be mobilized to create an active form of political resistance -- interdependency is necessary for assembly in order to create a livable life

[[WHEN THOSE WHO FACE]{.mark} ACCELERATING prospects of
[precarity]{.mark} take to the streets and [begin their claim with "we
the people,"]{.mark} then [they are asserting that they]{.mark}, those
who appear and speak there, [are identified as "the
people]{.mark}."]{.underline} They are working to ward off the prospect
of oblivion. [The phrase does not imply]{.underline} that those who
profit are not "the people," and it does not necessarily imply [a simple
sense of inclusion: "we are the people, too." It can mean, "we are still
the people"---therefore, still persisting and not yet
destroyed]{.underline}. Or **[[it can assert]{.mark} a form of [equality
in the face of]{.mark} increasing [inequality; participants do
this]{.mark} not simply by uttering that phrase, but [by embodying
equality to whatever extent]{.mark} that [proves possible, constituting
an assembly of the people]{.mark} on the grounds of
equality]{.underline}**. One might say, equality is experimentally and
provisionally asserted in the midst of inequality, to which critics
respond: this is vain and useless, since their acts are only symbolic,
and true economic equality continues to become more elusive for those
whose debts are astronomical and employment prospects foreclosed. And
yet, it seems that [the embodiment of equality [in]{.mark} the
[practices of assembly, the insistence on interdependency and]{.mark} a
fair distribution of labor tasks, [the notion of a commonly held
ground]{.mark} or "the commons," all [start to put into the world a
version of equality that is rapidly vanishing in other
quarters]{.mark}.]{.underline} **[[The point is not to regard the body
merely as an instrument for making a political claim]{.mark}, [but to
let]{.mark} this body, [the plurality of bodies, become the precondition
of all further political claims]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Indeed, in the
politics of the street that has been with us in the last years, in
**[[the Occupy Movement, Tahrir Square]{.mark} in its early stages,
[Puerta del Sol, Gezi Park, and the favela movement in Brazil, the basic
requirements of the body are at the center of political
mobilizations]{.mark}]{.underline}**---those requirements are, in fact,
publicly enacted prior to any set of political demands. Over and against
forces of privatization, the destruction of public services and the
ideals of the public good precipitated by the takeover of neoliberal
forms of rationality in governance and everyday life, [bodies
require]{.underline} food and shelter, protection from injury and
violence, and [the freedom to move, to work]{.underline}, to have access
to health care; [[bodies require other bodies for support and for
survival]{.underline}]{.mark}.14 It matters, of course, what age those
bodies are, and whether they are able-bodied, since [in all forms of
dependency, bodies require not just one other person, but social systems
of support that are complexly human and technical.]{.underline} It is
precisely in a world in which the supports for bodily life of increasing
numbers of people are proving to be highly precarious that bodies are
emerging together on the pavement or the dirt or along the wall that
separates them from their land---[this assembly, which can include
virtual participants, still assumes a set of interlocking locations for
a plural set of bodies]{.underline}. And in this way, the bodies belong
to the pavement, the ground, the architecture, and the technology by
which they live and move and work and desire. Although there are those
who will say that active bodies assembled on the street constitute a
powerful and surging multitude, one that in itself constitutes a radical
democratic event or action, I can only partially agree with that view[.
[When the people break off from established power, they enact the
popular will]{.underline}]{.mark}, though to know that for certain, we
would have to know who is breaking off, and where, and who does not
break off, and where they are. There are, after all, all sorts of
surging multitudes I would not want to endorse (even if I do not dispute
their right to assemble), and they would include lynch mobs,
anti-Semitic or racist or fascist congregations, and violent forms of
antiparliamentary mass movements. I am less concerned with the
ostensible vitality of surging multitudes or any nascent and promising
life force that seems to belong to their collective action than I am
with joining a struggle to establish more sustaining conditions of
livability in the face of systematically induced precarity and forms of
racial destitution. [The final aim of politics is not simply to surge
forth together]{.underline} (though this can be an essential moment of
affective intensity within a broader struggle against precarity),
[constituting a new lived sense of the "people," even if sometimes, for
the purposes of radical democratic change---which I do endorse---[it is
important to surge forth in ways that claim and alter the attention of
the world for some more enduring possibility of livable life for
all]{.mark}.]{.underline} [It is one thing to feel alive, or to affirm
aliveness, and yet another to say that that fleeting sense is all that
we can expect from politics. [Feeling alive is not quite the same as
struggling for a world in which life becomes livable]{.mark} for those
who have not yet been valued as living beings.]{.underline} Although I
understand that something has to hold such a group together, some
demand, some felt sense of injustice and unlivability, some shared
intimation of the possibility of change, [there is also a desire to
produce a new form of sociality on the spot. [These mobilizations make
their claims through language, action, gesture, and movement; through
linking arms; through refusing to move]{.mark}; through forming bodily
modes of obstruction to police and state authorities. A given movement
can move in and out of the space of heightened exposure, depending on
its strategies and the military and police threats it must
face.]{.underline} In each of these cases, however, we can say that
these bodies form networks of resistance together, remembering that
[[bodies who are active agents of resistance are also fundamentally in
need of support]{.underline}]{.mark}. In resistance, [vulnerability is
not precisely converted into agency---it remains the condition of
resistance, a condition of the life from which it emerges, the condition
that, rendered as precarity, has to be opposed, and is
opposed.]{.underline} This is something other than weakness or
victimization, since, for the precarious, [[resistance requires]{.mark}
exposing the abandoned or unsupported dimensions of life, but also
[mobilizing that vulnerability as a deliberate and active form of
political resistance]{.mark}, an exposure of the body to power in the
plural.]{.underline}

###  PRF Delegitimizes Government

#### Performative revolutionary fiat negates state legitimacy which disrupts the spatial organization of power including restrictions to movement

[Many of the **[massive demonstrations]{.mark}** and modes of resistance
we have seen in the last months not only **[produce a space of
appearance]{.mark}**; they seize upon an already established space
permeated by existing power, seeking to sever the relations between the
public space, the public square, and the existing regime]{.underline}.
So [the limits of the political are exposed and the link between the
theater of legitimacy and public space is severed]{.underline}; that
theater is no longer unproblematically housed in public space, since
public space now occurs in the midst of another action, one that
displaces the power that claims legitimacy precisely by taking over the
field of its effects. Simply put, **[[the bodies on the street redeploy
the space of appearance in order to contest and negate the existing
forms of political legitimacy]{.underline}]{.mark}**- and just as they
sometimes fill or take over public space, the material history of those
structures also works on them, becoming part of their very action,
remaking a history in the midst of its most concrete and sedimented
artifices. [**[These are subjugated and empowered actors who seek to
wrest legitimacy from an existing state apparatus]{.mark}** that depends
upon the regulation of the public space of appearance for its theatrical
self-constitution]{.underline}. In wresting that power, [a new space is
created, a new "between" of bodie]{.underline}s, as it were, [that lays
claim to existing space through the action of a new
alliance]{.underline}, and those bodies are seized and animated by those
existing spaces in the very acts by which they reclaim and resignify
their meanings. [**[Such a struggle intervenes in the spatial
organization of power, which includes]{.mark}** the allocation and
**[restriction of spatial locations in which]{.mark}** and by which
**[any population may appear]{.mark}**, which implies a spatial
regulation of when and how the "popular will" may appear]{.underline}.
This view of the spatial restriction and allocation of who may
appear---in effect, of who may become a subject of appearance---suggests
an operation of power that works through both foreclosure and
differential allocation.

###  Perm/Ethical obligation

#### Even in the face of unchosen cohabitation, we have an ethical obligation to speak out against the oppression the state exerts in our name - protest police militarization that entraps black bodies.

[We might think that **[interdependency]{.mark}** is a happy or
promising notion, but it **[is often the condition for]{.mark}**
territorial wars and forms of **[state violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Indeed, I am not sure that we have yet been able to think about the
unmanageability of dependency at the level of politics---to what fear,
panic, repulsion, violence, and domination it can lead. It is true that
I am trying to struggle toward an affirmation of interdependency in what
I have offered here, but I am trying to underscore just how difficult it
is to struggle for social and political forms that are committed to
fostering a sustainable interdependency on egalitarian terms. When any
of us are affected by the sufferings of others, it is not only that we
put ourselves in their place or that they usurp our own place; perhaps
it is the moment in which a certain chiasmic link comes to the fore and
[[I become somehow implicated in lives that are clearly not]{.mark} the
same as [my own]{.mark}. And this happens [even when we do not know the
names of those who make their appeal to us or when we struggle
to]{.mark} pronounce the name or to [speak in a language we have never
learned]{.mark}]{.underline}. At their best, some media representations
of suffering at a distance compel us to give up our more narrow
communitarian ties and to respond, sometimes in spite of ourselves,
sometimes even against our will, to a perceived injustice. Such
presentations can bring the fate of others near or make it seem very far
away, and yet, [the kinds of **[ethical demands]{.mark}** that emerge
through the media in these times **[depend on this reversibility of
proximity and distance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed, certain bonds are
actually wrought through this very reversibility, however incomplete it
is. And we might find ways of understanding the interdependency that
characterizes cohabitation precisely as these bonds. For if I am here
and there, I am also not ever fully there, and even if I am here, I am
always more than fully here. Is there a way to understand this
reversibility as limited by bodily time and space in such a way that the
other is not radically other, and I am not radically over here as an I,
but the link, the joint, is chiasmic and only and always partly
reversible and partly not? There are, as we know, antagonistic ties,
wretched bonds, raging and mournful modes of connectedness. In those
cases, [**living with others [on]{.mark}** adjacent lands or on
contested or **[colonized lands]{.mark}** produces aggression and
hostility in the midst of that cohabitation. The mode of unchosen
cohabitation that belongs to the colonized is surely not the same as the
notion of a democratic plurality established on grounds of
equality.]{.underline} But they both have their mode of wretched
attachment and adjacency.6 [Even in situations of antagonistic and
unchosen modes of cohabitation, **[certain ethical obligations
emerge]{.mark}**]{.underline}. First, since we do not choose with whom
to cohabit the earth, [**[we have to honor those obligations to preserve
the lives of those we may not love]{.mark}**, those we may never love,
do not know, **[and did not choose]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Second, these
obligations emerge from the social conditions of political life, not
from any agreement we have made or from any deliberate choice. And yet,
these very social conditions of livable life are precisely those that
have to be achieved "[We cannot rely on them as presuppositions that
will guarantee our good life together. On the contrary, they supply the
ideals toward which we must struggle]{.underline}, which involves a
passage through the problem of violence. **[[Because we are bound to
realize these conditions; we are also bound to one another, in
passionate and fearful alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}**, often in spite
of ourselves, but ultimately for ourselves, for a "we" who is constantly
in the making. Third, these conditions imply equality, as Arendt tells
us, but also **[[an exposure to precarity]{.underline}]{.mark}** (a
point derived from Levinas), [which **[leads us to understand a global
obligation imposed upon us to find]{.mark}** political and economic
**[forms that minimize precarity and establish]{.mark}** economic
political **[equality]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Those [forms of
cohabitation characterized by equality and minimized precarity become
the goal to be achieved by any struggle against subjugation and
exploitation]{.underline}, but also the goal that starts to be achieved
in the practices of alliances that assemble across distances to achieve
that very goal. We struggle in, from, and against precarity. Thus, it is
not from pervasive love for humanity or a pure desire for peace that we
strive to live together. We live together because we have no choice, and
though [**[we]{.mark}** sometimes **[rail against that unchosen
condition, we remain obligated to struggle to affirm the ultimate value
of that unchosen social world]{.mark}**]{.underline}, an affirmation
that is not quite a choice, a struggle that makes itself known and felt
precisely when we exercise freedom in a way that is necessarily
committed to the equal value of lives. We can be alive or dead to the
sufferings of others---they can be dead or alive to us. But [it is only
when we understand that what happens there also happens here, and that
"here" is already an elsewhere, and necessarily so, that we stand a
chance of grasping the difficult and shifting global connections in ways
that let us know the transport and the constraint of what we might still
call ethics]{.underline}

###  Opaque solidarity/ Hunger strikes solve

#### Opaque forms of solidarity and opposition to precarity constitute a form freedom of assembly and challenge to the legitimacy of the institution. Hunger strikes in prisons are perfect examples of bodily performativity being used to challenge the regulatory power of the prison

At the outset, I confessed that I experience a certain thrill, dating
back to my adolescent years, when bodies get together in the street, and
yet I am quite suspicious of those political views that hold, for
instance, that democracy has to be understood as the event of the
surging multitude. I don't think so. It seems to me that we have to ask
[what it is that holds such a group together, what demand is being
shared, or what felt sense of injustice and unlivability, what
intimation of the possibility of change heightens the collective sense
of things]{.underline}. For all that [**[to be democratic, there has to
be an opposition to existing]{.mark} and expanding
[inequalities]{.mark}**, to ever-increasing conditions of precarity for
many populations both locally and globally, and to forms of
authoritarian and securitarian control that seek to suppress democratic
processes and movements]{.underline}. Although we sometimes do imagine
that political deliberation and action take place in the form of an
assembly, there are other ways of conferring and acting that do not
presuppose the occupation of the same ground. [**[There are bodies that
assemble on the street]{.mark} or [online or]{.mark} [through]{.mark}
other [less visible networks of solidarity]{.mark}**, especially for
prisoners whose political claims are made through forms of
solidarity]{.underline} that may or may not appear directly in any one
public space, and whose solidarity, when it emerges, rests on a common
and forcible exclusion from public space, and a forcible isolation in
cells monitored by police or security personnel. [This raises the
question of what form the freedom of assembly takes when it is
explicitly denied as a right]{.underline}. If we say there is no freedom
of assembly in prison, or that it is limited, then we certainly
acknowledge that [those in prison have been forcibly deprived of that
freedom]{.underline}, and we can then debate the justice or injustice of
having been deprived of that quite essential dimension of citizenship. I
am all for that. At the same time, however, I want to suggest that
[furtive and sometimes effective ways of exercising freedom of assembly
do happen in prison,]{.underline} and that we won't be able to
conceptualize that form of resistance without conceding that point.
[**The [forms of solidarity and action]{.mark} that do emerge [within
prisons, including hunger strikes]{.mark}, also [constitute a form of
freedom of assembly]{.mark}, or a form of solidarity implied by such a
freedom, and [that]{.mark} also [needs to be acknowledged as an active
form of resistance]{.mark}**. So already we see that the street and the
square are not the only platforms for political resistance]{.underline},
and that where there is no freedom to enter the square or take to the
street, grounds for resistance certainly exist. [Can the four walls of
the prison cell also turn out to be a platform, analogous perhaps to the
overturned tank that suddenly becomes a platform on which people stand
to voice their public opposition to the military]{.underline}, as
happened in Cairo in 2009? The confined body does not always have the
freedom to move, but can it still make use of its confinement to express
resistance? At such moments, the public square is not the support for
such action (though people gathered there, supporting those in prison,
surely can be support, and can make use of that spatial support and its
symbolic power), but support assumes yet another meaning, on the inside
and the outside, in modes of solidarity, through ways that [t[he body
can exercise the refusal to eat and to work, to devise modes of
communication, and to refuse to be a functional
prisoner]{.underline}]{.mark}[, intervening "to thwart the reproduction
of the institution of the prison. [Prisons depend upon the successful
regulation of human acts]{.mark} and movements]{.underline}, the
reproduction of the body of the prisoner, and when that regulatory power
fails, as it does, for instance, in the hunger strike, so too does the
prison lose its capacity to function. Moreover, this failure to function
is also linked to the imperiling or the killing of the prisoner itself.
One might remember in Kafka's "In the Penal Colony" that the apparatus
of punishment destroys the prisoner precisely when it goes out of
control. This going out of control is perhaps induced by the hunger
striker, but really, what is wanted is to expose the killing machine
that the prison has always been, even when it works efficiently. For [if
the effective reproduction of the prisoner takes place in tandem with
the decimation of the condition of livability for the prisoner, then
death-bound movement is already happening prior to any hunger strike.
The hunger strike exposes the death-dealing already at work in the
prison]{.underline}. In this sense, [[the hunger strike is a bodily
enactment]{.underline}]{.mark}, following its own protocols of
performativity; it enacts what it seeks to show, and to resist

###  Solvency/ Freedom of Assembly Pre-req

#### The freedom of assembly is a fundamental right not rooted within citizenship and sovereignty that functions as a precondition to politics- this exercise of freedom of assembly can contest the exercise of illegitimate policies unrepresentative of the people

**Butler '18** (Judith Butler, writes comparative literature on gender
theory and is a gender theorist who works at UC Berkeley, Hannah Arendt
Chair at the European Graduate School, Developed the theory on Gender
Performativity, LGBTQ activist, "Notes Toward A Performative Theory of

In some human rights discourses[, [the freedom of assembly is described
as a fundamental form of freedom that]{.mark} deserves to be protected
by government, which means that **[governments are obligated to
protect]{.mark} that freedom**]{.underline}; paradoxically, [governments
must protect the freedom of assembly against governmental
interference]{.underline}, which is a way of saying that [governments
are under strict obligations to restrain themselves from attacking the
rights of assembly by the illegitimate use of police and judicial powers
to detain, arrest, harass, threaten, censor, imprison, injure, or
kill.]{.underline} As we can see, there is a risk in this formulation
from the start: [[Does freedom of assembly depend upon being protected
by government, or does it depend upon a protection from
government?]{.underline}]{.mark} And does it make sense for the people
to rely on government to protect itself from government? Does the right
only exist if a government confers this right on its people, and does it
only exist to the extent that a government agrees to protect that right?
If so, then the destruction of those rights of assembly by a government
cannot be opposed by asserting the rights of assembly. We can agree that
[[freedom of assembly cannot be found in natural
law]{.underline}]{.mark}, but is it still in some important way
independent of any and every government? Does [freedom of
expression]{.underline}, in fact, exceed, even defy, those acts of
government by which it is protected and/or violated? These rights do
not, and cannot, depend on governmental protection in those cases when
the legitimacy of a government and the power of the state are being
contested precisely by such an assembly, or when a specific state has
contravened the rights of assembly such that its population can no
longer freely congregate without threat of state interference, including
military and police brutality. Moreover, when the power of the state to
"protect" rights is identical to the power of the state to withdraw that
very protection, and [**[people exercise the freedom of assembly to
contest]{.mark}** that form of arbitrary and **[illegitimate power
that]{.mark}** bestows and **[withdraws protection at will]{.mark}**,
then something in or of freedom of assembly moves outside the
jurisdiction of state sovereignty.]{.underline} One aspect of state
sovereignty is this very capacity to withdraw protection of the rights
of populations.2 That may be true, but perhaps what is being opposed is
the idea that freedom of assembly itself can be lost as a right when the
state opposes the aims of that assembly and seeks to outlaw assembly
itself. That happens, as we know, when the state itself becomes engaged
in facilitating the expansion of markets, in turning its own services
over to financial institutions, and thereby transforming public
entitlements into consumer goods or investment opportunities. [The
antiprivatization movement seeks to stop the saturation of the state in
market forces. Such **[movements often happen in tandem with a call to
question the legitimacy of a government]{.mark}** that has assumed
authoritarian powers]{.underline}---no one is arguing that free markets
now foster democracy, as Milton Friedman notoriously did in Chile under
Pinochet. In those cases in which privatization and authoritarianism are
publicly opposed, the state uses its own military, police, and legal
powers to suppress the freedom of assembly and other such (potentially
revolutionary) freedoms. So, freedom of assembly is something other than
a specific right allocated and protected by existing nation-states.
[This is why, although there are many [excellent studies on the history
of freedom of assembly]{.mark} in the United States, for instance, they
[do not always give us insight into transnational forms of
alliances]{.mark}, or global networks such as those that characterized
the Occupy Movement]{.underline}. If we restrict the analysis of freedom
of assembly to a particular national history of that right, we may
unwittingly imply that the right only exists insofar as the state
confers and protects that right. We may then depend upon the
continuation of the nation-state to secure the efficacy of that right.
That, of course, turns out not to be true if, by "freedom of assembly,"
the nation-state protects precisely that right that could, if
collectively exercised, bring down the state itself. I take it that this
is what is meant when Arendt and others see in freedom of assembly a
recurrence of the right of revolution.3 Still, [even if a particular
regime contains or protects such a right, it seems to me that **[the
freedom of assembly has to precede and exceed any form of government
that confers and protects that right of assembly]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
I say this not to affirm forms of permanent anarchy, and certainly not
to condone forms of mob rule, but only to suggest that [**[freedom of
assembly may well be a precondition of politics itself]{.mark}**, **[one
that presumes that bodies can move and gather in an unregulated way,
enacting their political demands]{.mark}** in a space **[that]{.mark}**,
as a result, becomes public, or **[redefines an existing understanding
of the public]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

###  We the People

#### "We the people" is always an exclusionary term that is restricted to those striving for hegemony. Our democracy controlled by elected officials is precisely what nullifies the will of the people because claims to representation are condensed down into a set of votes classified as a majority.

theory and is a gender theorist who works at UC Berkeley, Hannah Arendt

[Sometimes the people]{.underline}, or some people, [are confined or
absent, or outside the purview of the street and the camera---they are
the uncapturable]{.underline}, though they may well be captured in
another sense. [It never really happens that all of the possible people
who are represented by the notion of "the people" show up in the same
space and at the same time to claim that they are the
people]{.underline}! As if they were all free to move, as if they all of
their own volition arrived together in some space and time that can be
described or photographed in some all-inclusive way! Indeed, it would be
odd, if not terrifying, to imagine every member of the group called "the
people" coming together and speaking in unison---that would be a
fantasy, if not a potentially persecutory phantasm, whose seductive
power is linked with its fundamental unrealizability. Usually, we
associate the event of everyone speaking the same thing at the same time
with forms of fascism or other compulsory forms of conformity. In fact,
**[["we the people]{.mark}"---the utterance, the chant, the written
line---[is always missing some group of people it claims to
represent]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Some people fail to show up or are
constrained from doing so; [many live on the margins of the metropole,
[some are congregated on the border in refugee camps]{.mark} waiting for
documentation, transfer, and shelter, [and yet others are in prison or
detained in camps]{.mark}]{.underline}. Those who are situated elsewhere
may, if they can, be saying something else, or they are texting or
blogging, or functioning through new media; some are emphatically or
indifferently not speaking at all. [This means that "the people" never
really arrive as a collective presence that speaks as a verbal chorus;
whoever the people may be, they are surely internally divided, appearing
differentially]{.underline}, sequentially, not at all, or in degree,
probably also in some measure both gathered and dispersed, and so
ultimately not a unity.[8 In fact, [as we know from]{.mark} the summer
demonstrations in both [Turkey and Egypt]{.mark} in 2013, one group
gathers in one place and claims to be the people, and another group
gathers across the way and makes the same claim, or the government
gathers a group of people precisely in order to take the image that
functions as the visual signifier of "the people.]{.underline}" [[Access
to any public square presupposes access to some media]{.mark} that
relays the events outside of that space and time; the public square is
now partially established as a media effect]{.underline}, but also as
part of the enunciatory apparatus by which a group of people claims to
be the people; the connection of the public square with the media that
circulates the event means that the people disperse as they gather; the
media image shows and disperses the gathering. This implies the need to
radically rethink the public square as always already dispersed through
the media representation without which it loses its representative
claim. It also means that whoever [the people may be is not quite known
or knowable,]{.underline} and not only because the media frame limits
and morphs the idea of the people it relays. What is known, however, is
that [[the people]{.mark}, whoever they may be, show up and do not, [are
subject to various restrictions of movement and assembly, and are
internally divided]{.mark} about who they are]{.underline}. Showing up
together does not mean that everyone agrees with everything that is said
in the name of the assembly or even that the assembly has a name. The
contest over the name becomes a hegemonic struggle, and "the people"
seems to be another name for that contest. So, what follows? [A people
do not need to be united on every issue, and cannot be]{.underline}. And
neither do they all have to gather in a single space for concerted
action to take place in the name of the people. [That name, "the
people," even the declaration, "we the people," does not quite capture
what the people do, for there is always something other than the
particular group that has formed and appeared and seems to be speaking
of what all the people might want, precisely because there is a gap
between what happens in the name of the people and what the people
want]{.underline}. Not all the people want the same thing or want it in
the same way---this failure does not need to be lamented. [[The name of
the people is appropriated, contested, and renewed]{.underline}]{.mark},
always at risk of being expropriated or dismissed, and the fragility and
ferocity that mark the hegemonic struggle over the name are but signs of
its democratic operation. So even as some speaker or set of speakers
invoke a "we" that fairly and fully represents all the people, the
plural "we" cannot really do what it nevertheless does; such [speakers
may surely continue to strive for more inclusive aims, underscoring the
aspirational character of the "we," bu[t]{.mark}]{.underline} [[if the
"we" is to work politically, it has to be restricted to those who
attempt to achieve and exercise hegemonic power]{.underline}]{.mark}
through its invocation. Indeed, those who assemble as the "we,"
presenting themselves as "the people," are not finally representing the
people fully and adequately; rather, they are performing several
functions at once: for instance[, if they can vote, they provide the
legitimating ground for those who come to represent the people through
elections]{.underline}. But perhaps equally importantly, [the claim of
elected officials to be representative requires the condensation of the
people into a set of votes that can be tallied as a
majority]{.underline}. In this sense, [[the people]{.mark} [are
abbreviated and]{.mark} [nearly lost at the moment in which they elect
those who represent them]{.mark}, and political representation in this
sense abbreviates, quantifies, something we might call the will of the
people]{.underline}. At the same time, something nonelectoral is also at
work. The people who speak the "we," whether within the electoral
process, outside it, or against it, constitute themselves as the people
in the course of enacting or vocalizing that plural pronoun either
literally or figuratively. [[Standing together in the face of the police
can be precisely an enactment of that plural pronoun without saying a
word. When the Turkish government]{.mark} in the summer of 2013
[banned]{.mark} [assemblies]{.mark} in Taksim Square, [one man stood
alone]{.mark}, facing the police, clearly "obeying" the law not to
assemble]{.underline}. As he stood there, more individuals stood "alone"
in proximity to him, but not exactly as a "crowd." They were standing as
single individuals, but they were all standing, silent and motionless,
as single individuals, evading the standard idea of an "assembly" yet
producing another one in its place. They technically obeyed the law
forbidding groups from assembling and moving by standing separately and
saying nothing. [This became an articulate yet wordless
demonstration]{.underline}.

#### The United States is founded upon popular sovereignty as the basis for its system of authority. Declaring "we the people" is an embodied protest that uproots the legitimacy of the government's political authority to legislate as representative of the people.

IN DEMOCRATIC THEORY, ["[we the people" is]{.mark} nevertheless first
and foremost [a speech act]{.mark}]{.underline}. Someone says "we" along
with someone else, or some group says it together, perhaps chanting, or
they write it and send it out into the world, or they stand one by one,
or perhaps provisionally together, motionless and wordless, enacting
assembly; when they say it, they seek to constitute themselves as "the
people" from the moment in which it is declared. So considered as a
speech act, ["we the people" is an enunciation that seeks to bring about
the social plurality it names.]{.underline} It does not describe that
plurality, but gathers that group together through the speech act. It
would seem, then, that [[a linguistic form of autogenesis is at work in
the expression]{.mark} "we the people]{.underline}"; it seems to be a
rather magical act or, at least, one that compels us to believe in the
magical nature of the performative. Of course, "we the people" starts a
longer declaration of wants and desires, intended acts, and political
claims. It is a preamble; it prepares the way for a specific set of
assertions. It is a phrase that gets us ready for a substantive
political claim, and yet, we have to pause at this way of starting up
the sentence and ask whether a political claim is already being made, or
is in the making even before someone speaks or signs. It is perhaps
impossible for all the people who might say "we the people" at the same
time to speak that phrase in unison. And if somehow an assembled group
were to yell out, "we the people," as sometimes happens in the
assemblies of the Occupy Movement, it is a brief and transitory moment,
one in which a single person speaks at the same time that others speak,
and some unintended plural sounding results from that concerted plural
action, that speech act spoken in common, in sequence, with all the
variations that repetition implies. But let us admit that such a moment
of literally speaking in unison, and naming ourselves as "the people,"
rarely happens quite like that---simultaneous and plural. After all, the
declaration of "we the people" in the United States is a citation, and
the phrase is never fully freed of its citationality. The
[**[Declaration of Independence]{.mark}** of the United States **[begins
with]{.mark} such a phrase,** one that authorizes the writers to speak
for the people more generally**. It is [a phrase that establishes
political authority at the same time that it declares a form of popular
sovereignty]{.mark} bound by no one political authority**]{.underline}.
Derrida has analyzed this in some very important ways, as has Bonnie
Honig. [Popular sovereignty can give itself]{.underline} (in assent) and
withdraw itself (in dissent or in revolution), [which means that every
regime is dependent on it being given if it hopes to base its legitimacy
on something other than coercion.]{.underline} The speech act, however
punctual, is nevertheless inserted in a citational chain, and that means
that [[the temporal conditions for making the speech act precede]{.mark}
and exceed the momentary occasion of [its
enunciation]{.mark}]{.underline}. And for yet another reason the speech
act, however illocutionary, is not fully tethered to the moment of its
enunciation: the social plurality designated and produced by the
utterance cannot all assemble in the same place to speak at the same
time, so it is both a spatially and temporally extended phenomenon.
[When and where popular sovereignty---the self-legislative power of the
people---is "declared" or, rather, "declares itself," it is not exactly
at a single instance, but instead in a series of speech acts or what I
would suggest are performative enactments that are not restrictively
verbal.]{.underline} So I suppose my question might be formulated this
way: What are the bodily conditions for the enunciation of "we the
people," and do we make a mistake if we separate the matter of what we
are free to say from how we are free to assemble? I propose to think
about the assembly of bodies as a performative enactment, and so to
suggest not only that (a) [[popular sovereignty is a performative
exercise]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} (b) it necessarily [involves a
performative enactment of bodies]{.mark},]{.underline} sometimes
assembled in the same place and sometimes not. First, I propose that we
have to understand the idea of popular sovereignty that "we the people"
seeks to secure. [If ["we the people]{.mark}" set forth [in the
Constitution "declare a set of truths to be self-evident"]{.mark} as
they apparently do in the Declaration of Independence, then we are
already in a bit of a bind.]{.underline} [A performative declaration
seeks to bring about those truths, but if they are "self-evident" then
they are precisely the kind of truths that don't need to be brought
about at all. Either they are performatively induced or they are
self-evident, but to bring about that which is self-evident seems
paradoxical]{.underline}. We could say that a set of truths is being
brought into being or we could say that we found those truths somewhere
and that we did not bring them into being. Or we can say that the kind
of truths at issue here have to be declared as self-evident for that
self-evidence to be known. In other words, they have to be made evident,
which means that they are not self-evident. This circularity seems to
risk contradiction or tautology, but perhaps these truths only become
evident in the manner in which they are declared. In other words, [the
performative enactment of the truth is the way of making evident that
very truth,]{.underline} since the truth in question is not pregiven or
static but enacted or exercised through a particular kind of plural
action[. If it is the very capacity for plural action that is at stake
in claiming popular sovereignty, then there is no way to "show" this
truth outside of the plural and invariably conflictual enactment we call
self-constitution]{.underline}. If the plural subject is constituted in
the course of its performative action, then it is not already
constituted; whatever form it has prior to its performative exercise is
not the same as the form it takes as it acts, and after it has acted. So
how do we then understand this movement of gathering, which is
durational, and implies occasional, periodic, or definitive forms of
scattering? It is not one act, but a convergence of actions different
from one another, a form of political sociality irreducible to
conformity. Even when a crowd speaks together, they have to gather in
close enough proximity to hear each other's voice, to pace each person's
own vocalization, to achieve rhythm and harmony to a sufficient degree,
and so to achieve a relation both auditory and corporeal with those with
whom some signifying action or speech act is undertaken. We start to
speak now and stop now. We start to move now, or more or less at a given
time, but certainly not as a single organism. We try to stop all at
once, but some keep moving, and others move and rest at their own pace.
[[Temporal seriality and coordination, bodily proximity, auditory range,
coordinated vocalization---]{.mark}all of these [constitute essential
dimensions of assembly and demonstration]{.mark}]{.underline}. And they
are all presupposed by the speech act that enunciates "we the people";
they are the complex elements of the occasion of that enunciation, the
nonverbal forms of its signification. If we try to take vocalization as
the model of the speech act, then [the body is surely presupposed as the
organ of speech, both the organic condition and the vehicle of
speech]{.underline}. The body is not transmuted into pure thought as it
speaks, but signifies the organic conditions for verbalization, which
means, according to Shoshana Felman, that [the speech act is always
doing something more and other than what it is actually saying. So just
as there is no purely linguistic speech act separated from bodily
acts]{.underline}, there is no purely conceptual moment of thought that
does away with its own organic condition. And this tells us something
about what it means to say [["we the people,"]{.underline}]{.mark} since
whether it is written in a text or uttered on the street, [it
[designates an assembly]{.mark} in the act of designating and forming
itself.]{.underline} It acts on itself as it acts, and a corporeal
condition of plurality is indexed whether or not it appears on the
occasion of the utterance. That bodily condition, plural and dynamic, is
a constitutive dimension of that occasion. [The embodied character of
the people proves quite important to the kinds of demands that are made,
since it is more often than not that basic bodily needs are not being
met by virtue of the devastated ways of life]{.underline}. It may offend
us theoretically to speak of "basic bodily needs," as if a certain
ahistorical notion of the body is invoked for the purposes of making
moral and political claims to fair treatment and the just distribution
of public goods. [But perhaps it would be even less acceptable to refuse
to speak about bodily needs at all for fear of falling into a
theoretical impasse]{.underline}. It is not a matter of accepting the
ahistorical or historical version of the body, for even the formulation
of historical construction has its invariant features, and [every
universal concept of the body is drawn from very specific historical
formations.]{.underline} So neither side of that debate knows what kind
of relation it is in to the other. Every particular bodily need can be
articulated historically in one way or another, and it may well be that
what is called a "need" is precisely a historical articulation of
urgency that is not for that reason a mere effect of the articulation.
In other words[, there is no way to separate the idea of a bodily need
from the representational scheme that differentially recognizes bodily
needs and, too often, fails to recognize them at all]{.underline}. This
does not make bodily needs fully ahistorical, but neither does it make
them into pure effects of a specifically historical discourse. Once
again, the relation between the body and discourse is chiastic,
suggesting that the body has to be represented and that it is never
fully exhausted by that representation. Moreover, [the differential ways
that it is and is not represented saturate the representation of needs
in fields of power]{.underline}. One can also take into account the
production of needs discussed by Marx and amplified theoretically by
Agnes Heller13 without claiming that "there is no such thing as a need."
We could doubtless use other words, and trace the productive character
of the words we use to amplify the phenomena, but we would still be
talking about something, even if there is no way to get at that
something without the language we use, even if we invariably transfigure
that something by using the language we do. [[The notion of "needs" then
would be an always already linguistically transfigured sense of
requirement]{.mark} or urgency, and would be adequately captured neither
by those synonyms nor by any others]{.underline}.

##  [Black Weapons]{.underline}

###  Symbolic Artillery

#### Black bodies are [literal artillery]{.underline}---weapons of civil society to justify conflict and [reign terror]{.underline}. Flesh [severed]{.underline} from life, a metaphysical [nothingness]{.underline}, Blackness is left as a [machine]{.underline} whose only purpose is destruction. It is from this understanding of [arms]{.underline} that we choose to [descend]{.underline} from with regards to the topic.

**Warren '18** (Calvin Warren, Calvin Warren is an Assistant Professor
in WGSS. He received his B.A. in Rhetoric/Philosophy (College Scholar)
from Cornell University and his MA and Ph.D. in African
American/American Studies from Yale University, 2018, *Ontological
Terror: Blackness, Nihilism, and Emancipation*) \\\\EG

The question of value, then, reconfigures our proper metaphysical
question. In essence, it inquires about how to ground value of a being
lacking place in the world.32 The illustrators provide an answer to this
inquiry: since [[black being exists for **destruction**]{.mark}, why not
make this being [an extension of **war machines**]{.mark}?]{.underline}
In this fantasy, [black being is [a **sentient weapon**, blurring the
distinction between]{.mark} **machine** and flesh, [**weapon** and
body.]{.mark}]{.underline} Warfare provides value for sentient refuse.
[[Black bodies are]{.mark} literal [**artilleries** of destruction ---
there is no self]{.mark} to protect, [just]{.mark} an open
[**vulnerability** to deadly violence]{.mark}]{.underline}. We might
also suggest that the black weapon prefigures the suicide bomber, which
preoccupies contemporary analysis of necropolitics. But martyrdom is
absent from such an analysis because [[the black weapon is pure use
value.]{.underline}]{.mark} The weapon does not sacrifice itself;
[[**destruction** is its reason for existence]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Black weapons also lack any relationality between humans and a political
community from which to ground such self-sacrifice. Black death,
vulnerability, injury, and destruction are mere comedic by-products of a
war between humans. In the image, soldiers easily affix cannons to black
bodies and position these weapons in the line of fire. The battlefield
is precisely the space of emancipation --- a death-scape. And the being
emancipation creates in this space is the black weapon. [**War**
allegorizes the metaphysical holocaust, which places black being in
extraordinary harm]{.underline} without regard to any ontological ground
of resistance. [This war]{.underline}, unlike the Civil War, [is
**without end**. [The **black weapon** is]{.mark} being for another
[within an economy of brutality, **strategy**, and
calculation]{.mark}.]{.underline} This catachrestic fantasy realizes the
terror Heidegger envisioned with his critique of technological
reasoning. The complete collapse between technology and flesh could only
be realized with black being, and the image articulates this
understanding.33 It is unthinkable that the union soldiers would become
weapons because they are human beings. Thus, it is not just that the
image is viciously satirical, but also that the image exposes a kernel
of truth: [[it]{.mark} is indeed plausible that black being could be
used in such a way in an antiblack world.]{.underline} Humor encases a
metaphysical truth. [Black being lacks ontological security and [is
**malleable** in the hands of humans. This is **ontological
terror**.]{.mark}]{.underline} We might also revisit the Lacanian terms
enjoyment and interpassivity --- for it seems that both are operative in
the catachrestic fantasy[. The cynosure of [the image is a black
weapon]{.mark} with a minstrel-like smile]{.underline} (a smile that
indicates utter obsequiousness to vicious demands and unawareness of
immediate danger), [gladly [sitting]{.mark} on the ground [to facilitate
the **soldier's reloading**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The smile is a
signifier of stupid enjoyment, a masochistic embrace of destruction.
Through the smile, the black weapon is aligned with the nothing and all
the terror it entails. The smile, then, is the figuration of
interpassivity and enjoyment. [[The **terror** of nothing is projected
onto]{.mark} black bodies ([black weapons]{.mark} must hold the
**destructive** enjoyment for the white subject, standing as a
substitutional receptacle for the human's enjoyment),]{.underline} and
the enjoyment is vicious --- it is the enjoyment of continual
destruction (the metaphysical holocaust).34 The smile also dockets a
certain duty or obligation of black being --- to rejoice in destruction
as service (in this way, service as black suicide is inconceivable for
the illustrator; only honor and duty explain the stupid enjoyment. The
illustrators, then, impose a fallacious agency on the weapon, which is
part of the vicious humor, since a weapon has no choice in the
matter/manner of its destruction). And we might say the smile signals
"arbitrary \[black\] death as a legitimate feature of a system," as
Lewis Gordon poignantly notes.35 The arbitrariness of black perishment
exposes its meaningless enjoyment through the loss of meaning.36 [[The
metaphysical world is a **battlefield** for blacks, blacks
**reconfigured** as weapons for a war without end.]{.mark} At any
moment, at any time, blacks could perish]{.underline} --- or, to retool
Heidegger, this perishment occurs in einem Augenblick (in a blink of an
eye, or immediately). Again, I am using the term perishment over
Gordon's death to docket the utter lack of meaning and being black
destruction entails. [Thus, there can never be Ereignis for black
weapons, no event in which death enables an authentic embrace of being.
Heideggerian death is impossible for black being. [There is only death
as]{.mark} **perishment** --- meaningless, arbitrary, and [**eventless**
destruction]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The smile is the internecine
sign of this destruction. The smile, then, is absolutely essential to
the image (its punctum, to borrow Barthes's term).37 The smile gets us
to the essence of the image. What the black weapon is smiling at is
nothing. This, ultimately, is the fantasy the illustrator presents, and
it serves to disavow the brutal context within which the weapon is
placed. For the illustrator, blacks embrace the terroristic nothing
antiblackness imposes upon it. Imposition is recast as masochistic
embrace. The image stages an encounter with nothing as a dutiful embrace
of onticide. [[The black body is **finished**.]{.mark} The image
articulates the closure of metaphysics: the [black]{.mark} body [is
nothing more than an antiblack invention, an **instrument** of a
destructive]{.mark} will to [power]{.mark}]{.underline}. Any agency we
imagine we can extract from this body by reclaiming and celebrating it
has evaporated in a toxic atmosphere. [By closure, however, I do not
mean the end (as is the fantasy of some postmetaphysicians) but the
**completion** of its internecine aim concerning black being. [The
aim]{.mark}, the metaphysical enterprise, [is to **sever** the flesh
from the body through]{.mark} the work of [violence, **degradation**,
and terror, such that what is left is not a]{.mark} [human body, but
a]{.mark} body as **[machine]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This is what the
image proudly proclaims. The image, then, can be read as an antiblack
celebration, a triumph over black being (and the intransigent remainder
of the flesh). In his brilliant essay "The Black Body as Fetish,"
Anthony Farley argues that [[the black body]{.mark} serves as the object
of white fantasy; the body [is pressed into narratives of]{.mark}
savagery and **[degradation]{.mark}** to maintain white mastery and
racial innocence.]{.underline} Taking something like Žižek's advice,
"Enjoy your symptom," seriously,38 Farley suggests that a masochistic
embrace of the function of the black body in antiblack fantasy produces
pleasure (or jouissance):

###  Instrument of Terror

#### Living in the wake means living as a [weapon]{.underline}, an [excuse]{.underline} to legitimate and empower violence as terror's [embodiment]{.underline}. It is from this understanding of [weaponry]{.underline} that we use in addressing the topic.

**Sharpe '16** (Christina Sharpe, Professor at York University, Sharpe
is a scholar of English literature and Black Studies, 2016, *In the
Wake: On Blackness and Being*) \\\\EG

If slavery persists as an issue in the political life of black America,
it is not because of an antiquarian obsession with bygone days or the
burden of a too-long memory, but because [black lives are **still
imperiled** and devalued by a racial calculus and a **political
arithmetic** that were entrenched centuries ago. [This is the
**afterlife** of slavery---skewed]{.mark} life [chances]{.mark}, limited
access to health and education, premature death, [**incarceration**, and
impoverishment]{.mark}.]{.underline} I, too, am the afterlife of
slavery. (Hartman 2007, 6) Living in/the wake of slavery is living "the
afterlife of property" and living the afterlife of partus sequitur
ventrem (that which is brought forth follows the womb), in which [[the
Black child inherits]{.mark} the non/status, [the **non/being** of the
mother]{.mark}.]{.underline} [That inheritance]{.underline} of a
non/status [is]{.underline} everywhere [apparent]{.underline} now [in
the **ongoing criminalization** of Black women and
children.]{.underline} [[Living in the wake]{.underline}]{.mark} on a
global level [[means living]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
**[disastrous]{.mark}**]{.underline} time and [effects of]{.underline}
continued [[marked migrations]{.underline}]{.mark}, Mediterranean and
Caribbean disasters, trans-American and -African migration, structural
adjustment [[imposed by the **I**]{.mark}**nternational
[M]{.mark}onetary [F]{.mark}und** that continues
imperialisms]{.underline}/colonialisms, and more. And here, in the
United States, [[it means]{.mark} living]{.underline} and dying through
the policies of the first US Black president; it means the gratuitous
violence of stop-and-frisk and Operation Clean Halls; rates of Black
incarceration that boggle the mind (Black people represent 60 percent of
the imprisoned population); [[the **immanence** of death as "a
**predictable and constitutive** aspect]{.mark} [of]{.mark} this
[democracy]{.mark}"]{.underline} (James and Costa Vargas 2012, 193,
emphasis mine). [[Living in the wake means]{.underline}]{.mark} living
the history and present of terror, from slavery to the present, as the
ground of our everyday Black existence; [living the]{.underline}
historically and geographically dis/continuous but always present and
[[endlessly **reinvigorated**]{.underline}
**[brutality]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in]{.underline},
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} on, [our bodies]{.underline} while even as
that terror is visited on our bodies the realities of that terror are
erased. Put another way, [living in the wake means [living in and with
**terror**]{.mark}]{.underline} in that in much of what passes for
public discourse about terror we, [[Black people, become the
**carriers** of terror, terror's **embodiment**]{.mark}, and not the
primary objects of terror's multiple enactments; [the ground of terror's
**possibility** globally.]{.mark}]{.underline} This is everywhere clear
as we think about those [[Black people]{.mark} in the United
States]{.underline} who [[can "**weaponize** sidewalks"]{.underline}
(**[Trayvon Martin]{.underline}**) [and **shoot themselves** while
handcuffed (Victor White III]{.underline}]{.mark}[, Chavis Carter, Jesus
Huerta, and more),]{.underline} those Black people transmigrating21 the
African continent toward the Mediterranean and then to Europe who are
imagined as insects, swarms, vectors of disease; [familiar [narratives
of danger and disaster]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[**attach** to]{.mark}
our [**always already weaponized** Black bodies (the **weapon is
blackness**).]{.mark}]{.underline} We must also, for example, think of
President Obama's former press secretary Robert Gibbs, who said,
commenting on the drone murder of sixteen-year-old US citizen
Abdulrahman Al-Alwaki, "I would suggest that you should have a far more
responsible father if you are truly concerned about the well being
\[sic\] of your children" (Grim 2012).22 We must consider this alongside
the tracking of Haitians and Dominicans of Haitian descent without
papers by drones in the midst of the ongoing ethnic cleansing in the
Dominican Republic.23 We must consider Gibbs's statement alongside
Barack Obama's reprimands of Black men in the United States, his
admonishing them to be responsible fathers. Consider, too, the
resurgence of narratives that Black people were better off in chattel
slavery. This is Black life in the wake; this is the flesh, these are
bodies, to which anything and everything can be and is done.

###  Wake of a Gun

#### The Black condition is defined as an [instrument of conflict]{.underline}, in the recoil of [gunshots]{.underline}, as a relegating force which is [attached]{.underline} to metaphors of [weaponization]{.underline} and militarism.

**Sharpe '16** (Christina Sharpe, Professor at York University, Sharpe
is a scholar of English literature and Black Studies, 2016, *In the
Wake: On Blackness and Being*) \\\\EG

A reprise and an elaboration: [Wakes are **processes**; through them we
think about the dead and about our relations to them; they are rituals
through which to enact grief and memory.]{.underline} Wakes allow those
among the living to mourn the passing of the dead through ritual; they
are the watching of relatives and friends beside the body of the
deceased from death to burial and the accompanying drinking, feasting,
and other observances, a watching practiced as a religious observance.
[But [wakes are]{.mark} also "[the **track** left]{.mark} on the water's
surface [by a ship]{.mark} (figure 1.4); the **disturbance** caused by a
body swimming, or one that is moved, in water; the air currents behind a
body in flight; [a region of **disturbed flow**; in the **line of sight
of**]{.mark} (an observed object); [and]{.mark} (something) [in the line
of **recoil of (a gun)";**]{.mark}]{.underline} finally, wake means
being awake and, also, consciousness. [[In the wake, the semiotics of
the slave ship **continue**: from]{.mark} the [forced movements of the
enslaved to]{.mark} the forced movements [of the migrant]{.mark} and the
refugee, [to the **regulation** of Black people in]{.mark} North
[American]{.mark} streets and [neighborhoods]{.mark}]{.underline}, to
those ongoing crossings of and drownings in the Mediterranean Sea, [[to
the]{.mark} brutal **colonial reimaginings** of the slave ship and the
ark; to the [reappearances of the slave ship in **everyday**]{.mark}
[**life** in]{.mark} the form of [the prison]{.mark}, the camp, and the
school.]{.underline} As we go about wake work, we must [[think through
containment]{.mark}, regulation, **[punishment]{.mark}**, capture, and
captivity [and the ways]{.mark} the manifold representations of
[blackness become]{.mark} the symbol, par excellence, for the
**[less-than-human]{.mark}** being condemned to death.]{.underline} [We
must [think about Black flesh,]{.mark} Black optics, and ways of
producing enfleshed work; think [the ways]{.mark} the hold cannot and
does not hold even as [the hold remains in]{.mark} the form of the
semiotics of the slave ship hold, the prison, the womb, and elsewhere in
and as [the tension between being and **instrumentality** that is Black
being in the **wake**.]{.mark}]{.underline} At stake is not recognizing
antiblackness as total climate. At stake, too, is not recognizing an
insistent Black visualsonic resistance to that imposition of non/being.
How might we stay in the wake with and as those whom the state positions
to die ungrievable deaths and live lives meant to be unlivable? These
are questions of temporality, the longue durée, the residence and hold
time of the wake. At stake, then is to stay in this wake time toward
inhabiting a blackened consciousness that would rupture the structural
silences produced and facilitated by, and that produce and facilitate,
Black social and physical death.

###  Sheer Potentiality

#### Blackness is a site of [sheer potentiality]{.underline}, an [impending terror]{.underline} birthed through the Middle Passage which is tied to the nature of [threats]{.underline}. 

**Sharpe '16** (Christina Sharpe, Professor at York University, Sharpe
is a scholar of English literature and Black Studies, 2016, *In the
Wake: On Blackness and Being*) \\\\EG

With these logics in mind, I want to suggest that [[what is]{.mark} also
being [birthed is]{.mark} what I call [**anagrammatical** blackness that
exists as an **index** of]{.mark} violability and also
**[potentiality]{.mark}**.]{.underline} J. Kameron Carter (2013, 593)
gets at something like this when in "Thinking with Spillers" he writes
that the " 'passage,' [then, in 'Middle Passage' is **sheer possibility
and potentiality**, while [the 'middle' in 'Middle Passage' is]{.mark} .
. .---[**existence in the middle** itself]{.mark}]{.underline}." As I
continue to think with Spillers's grammar, "which is really a rupture
and a radically different kind of cultural continuation" (Spillers
2003b, 209), and Fred Moten's opening sentences in In the Break, that
"the history of blackness is testament to the fact that objects can and
do resist" and "blackness---the extended movement of a specific
upheaval, an ongoing irruption that anarranges every line---is a strain
that pressures the assumption of the equivalence of personhood and
subjectivity" (Moten 2003, 1), I arrive at blackness as, [[blackness is,
anagrammatical]{.underline}]{.mark}. That is, [we can see the moments
[when]{.mark} blackness]{.underline} opens up into the anagrammatical in
the literal sense [[as]{.mark} when ["a word]{.mark}, phrase, or name
[is formed by **rearranging** the letters]{.mark} of
another"]{.underline} (Merriam-Webster Online). We can also apprehend
this in the metaphorical sense in how, r[egarding blackness, grammatical
[**gender** falls away and **new meanings** proliferate; how "the
letters]{.mark} of a text are [form]{.mark}ed [into a secret
message]{.mark} by rearranging them" or a secret message is discovered
through the rearranging of the letters of a text.]{.underline} Ana-, as
a prefix, means "up, in place or time, back, again, anew."11 So,
blackness anew, blackness as a/temporal, in and out of place and time
putting pressure on meaning and that against which meaning is made. [[We
see again and again how]{.underline}]{.mark}, in and out of the United
States (as my point of departure and arrival), [[girl doesn't mean
"girl" but]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example, [["**prostitute**"]{.mark}
or "felon,"12 [boy doesn't mean "boy," but]{.mark} "Hulk Hogan" or
"**[gunman]{.mark}**," "thug" or "urban youth."]{.underline}13 We see
that [[mother doesn't mean "mother," but]{.mark} "felon" and "defender"
and/or "**[birther of terror]{.mark}**"]{.underline} and not one of the
principal grounds of terrors multiple and quotidian enactments.14 We see
that child is not "child," and a Coast Guard cutter becomes, in
Brathwaite's hands, a Coast Guard gutter---not a rescue or a medical
ship but a carrier of coffins, a coffle, and so on.15 As the meanings of
words fall apart, we encounter again and again the difficulty of
sticking the signification. This is Black being in the wake. This is the
anagrammatical. These are Black lives, annotated. (I will return to what
I am calling Black annotation in the final section of this work, "The
Weather.")

###  Muting, Over-Dubbing, and Legitimizing

#### Can you [hear]{.underline} a shadow? In an antiblack world, Black suffering becomes [muted and overdubbed]{.underline} as the [weaponizing and legitimizing]{.underline} force of violence.

**Brady '12** (Nicholas Brady, Graduate student from UC Irvine, 11
October 2012, "Louder Than the Dark: Toward an Acoustics of Suffering",
https://thefeministwire.com/2012/10/louder-than-the-dark-towards-an-acoustics-of-suffering/)
\\\\EG

[[Can you hear a **shadow**?]{.mark}]{.underline} The more enlightened,
the deeper the shadows, but can the shadow enunciate the depth of its
sorrow back to the world it is invariably bound to? [A **silhouette** is
wheeled to the corner of a hallway]{.underline}, its face obscured. The
nurse has demanded that she leave the hospital. Unbeknownst to the
shadow, [the police]{.underline} happen to be in the building at the
same time and are asked to remove her from the premises. They [drag her
out of the wheelchair and **handcuff** her, leaving her slouched on the
ground. A few more cops come and they cart her away to literally rot in
a **jail** cell. [The shadow's name is **Anna Brown**.]{.mark} She has
also been named "the homeless lady," as well as **"the
crackhead"**]{.underline} or "drug sick" individual by the officers that
arrested her. She went to the hospital after spraining her ankle, was
arrested because she refused to leave due to continued pain, and was
found dead on the prison floor because her sprain produced blood clots
that lodged into her lungs. Due to medical malpractice and the police
officers' violence, [Anna passed away alone on the floor of a prison
cell]{.underline}. Yet, that last sentence was entirely too nice, for in
truth [[Anna]{.mark} Brown [was **murdered**.]{.mark}]{.underline} The
hesitation to describe this as a "murder" is because that implies an
event, a narrative, a "when," "where," and "who" (as in "who done it?").
Yet this was not an event with an acting subject; [she was instead
murdered [by **subjectivity** itself: a series of incidents]{.mark}
centered on her body, [each reverberating off each other into an
**orchestra of death**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Each proceeding was an echo
of the one preceding it: [waves of suffering reflecting off each action
through time. [Her death was caused by the **incoherence** of her
voice]{.mark}, her calls for care, [her **screams of
agony**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Put another way, she was murdered by civil
society's inability---and lack of desire---to hear her being. Discourse
on race normally focuses on the material and the visual, but the video
of Anna Brown's death points us less to the images and more to the
centrality of aurality to black suffering. The first part of the video
is without audio, but this does not mean sound is absent per se. That
the video lacks audio in the beginning says more than perhaps the
soundtrack itself could, for it makes explicit the [**inaudibility** of
black suffering. We know that [Anna]{.mark} Brown had [expressed
her]{.mark} lasting [pain, in spite of the doctor's opinion that she was
fine.]{.mark} The hospital then ordered her to leave and she protested,
saying that she was still in pain. [She was **forcibly** wheeled to the
hallway and]{.mark} eventually **[arrested]{.mark}** by the police.
[Her]{.mark} vocal [protests]{.mark}, critiques [of inadequate service
and expression of her persistent pain, fell on **deaf ears.** She
spoke]{.mark} the knowledge of her body, [but her voice was **muted and
over-dubbed** by the]{.mark} knowledge of the
[professionals.]{.mark}]{.underline} How can the black know about
itself? [How can the shadow speak back?]{.underline} The violence that
produces the subject (in this case, the doctor) robs Anna Brown of
vocality, not so much literally as ontologically. Insofar as an object
(a commodity, a slave) can speak, it cannot be said that it can
communicate. At the etymological root of "communicate" is the logic of
the commons or community: informing to participate in the world, sharing
one's utterance(s) to join the community.
[[Communication]{.underline}]{.mark}, not even to imply anything as
serious as the ethics of dialogue, [[requires an **equal** ontological
status amongst the communicators]{.mark}.]{.underline} That several
titles of the video online have called her the "homeless woman"
evidences one singular truth (the desire to insult her notwithstanding):
[Anna Brown, as the descendent of slaves, has no home while the doctors
are in their own dominion.]{.underline} In a public lecture titled
"People-of-Color-Blindness," Jared Sexton describes an experience at a
jazz club where the microphones go off, but the band continues to play.
Even though the sociality between the band and the audience has been
shut down, the band still plays on. Sexton uses this example to
dramatize how even though the black is socially dead, that does not
signify that black life is non-existent. Instead, our social death
signifies that black life is sealed off from the world and happens
elsewhere: "underground or in outer space." [In this way [Anna speaks,
but the microphone that would project her subjectivity to the world has
been turned off. Her suffering has been **rendered unreal** while her
voice is heard as incoherent and **dangerous**.]{.mark}]{.underline} If
Anna Brown's suffering is inaudible, the second half of the video speaks
to how [her voice and pain are criminalized.]{.underline} When [the
police]{.underline} arrive, they [surround Anna and then drag her out of
the wheelchair, handcuff her, and leave her on the hospital
floor.]{.underline} She is given two different charges: [[her protests
for better service are charged as "**trespassing**" and her inability to
walk due to her injury is charged as]{.mark} ["**resisting
arrest**."]{.mark}]{.underline} When she is in the police car, the
camera in the vehicle has a microphone. When they arrive at the prison,
Anna continues to tell them she can't walk and that she needs to be in a
hospital. [The police officers ignore her statements and instead
oscillate between asking her "are you going to get out" and threatening
her; "you have two seconds to \[swing your legs out\]..."]{.underline}
Each implies that she can move her legs and she is choosing not to. As
Saidiya Hartman writes in Scenes of Subjection, "the slave was
recognized as a reasoning subject who possessed intent and rationality
solely in the context of criminal liability." [[Her suffering remains
**inaudible**, but her voice can only be heard]{.mark} by the police [as
**challenging the law**, resisting arrest]{.mark}, disrespecting their
authority; her voice can only be heard [as a **legitimizing** force for
their violence.]{.mark} As they drag her out of the car, she screams out
in pain before the door is shut and her voice becomes
muffled.]{.underline}

This lack of properness and metaphysical truth is a symptom of the
nothing, for nothing lacks any proper place in metaphysics and cannot be
understood through its episteme. [Black being as nothing]{.underline},
then, [will always be out of place and **improper**]{.underline} [in an
antiblack world.]{.underline} It is the terror of the metaphysical
infrastructure, and one can never be a true or proper man when one bears
the weight of nothing. Through this analysis, we can understand the
anxiety concerning black being, placement, and nothing in antebellum
culture. In August 1842, for example, the free black population of
Philadelphia held a parade commemorating the abolition of slavery in the
West Indies. [[A]{.mark}n angry [mob of white citizens]{.mark} disrupted
the parade, [attacked]{.mark} participants, and commenced to **destroy**
[black homes and property. Seeking redress through the
**courts**]{.mark} for loss of property and injury, [the]{.mark} free
[black]{.mark} population [realized]{.mark} that [justice]{.mark} within
such a context [was impossible, as the]{.mark} grand [jury acquitted the
rioters and **blamed**]{.mark} free [blacks for **inciting** this
violence.]{.mark}]{.underline} Robert Purvis, a leader in the free black
population of Philadelphia, responded to the grand jury's decision with
dismay:49 "The measure of our suffering is full. . . . From the most
painful and minute investigation, in the feelings, views and acts of
this community --- in regard to us --- I am convinced of our utter and
complete nothingness in public estimation \[emphasis mine\]."50 What
sparked the riot, this devastating expression of antiblackness? We can
locate this eruption of violence at the metaphysical fault line between
necessity and hatred. [[Black being is]{.mark} both [a **necessary
instrument** for]{.mark} the human's self-constitution and an object of
**ferocious [hatred]{.mark}**[, since it bears the nothing of a
metaphysical]{.mark} [order]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words, the
riot is the symptom of a metaphysical problem: the public celebration of
black freedom sparks a terror in that ontological boundaries are
challenged and the transformation from black being, as
invention/instrument, to human being, as free, is not only considered
but celebrated. [It is also no surprise that the grand jury **blamed**
the victims for the riot, since [black freedom is a form of **violence**
for the human]{.mark}, a violence [that must be **met with**]{.mark}
extreme [force. The riot is a response to ontological terror.]{.mark}
"Free," when paired with ["black," is recast as a **weapon** against the
human]{.mark} and the metaphysical structure that sustains the
human.]{.underline} We are dealing with two registers of violence ---
one is an ontological violence and another is a physical form of
antiblack destruction. But Purvis's response to the violence is
perspicuous. He is "convinced of our utter and complete nothingness in
public estimation." If we read this statement as a mere political
lamentation, that blacks constitute a political cypher (nothingness)
within the law and political processes, then we limit our understanding
of the riot as event. The riot, within this reading, is just a form of
cruelty or irrational intolerance or a political-economic strategy of
subjection. With political readings of antiblack violence, violence is
not gratuitous but must be linked to some type of recognizable
transgression; when antiblack violence cannot be linked to recognizable
transgression, it is considered cruel or irrational --- a form of
individual pathology and not systemic necessity. If, however, the
essence of politics is nothing political, then we might read Purvis's
political commentary as a response to the proper metaphysical question.
His answer is that [black being is **nothingness** in public
estimation.]{.underline} We can understand nothingness as the condition
(-ness) of bearing nothing in an antiblack world. Antiblack violence,
then, constitutes the structure of this nothing. [[Black being is always
already under **attack**]{.mark}; peace, within an antiblack world, is a
fallacy (much like freedom).]{.underline} The metaphysical
infrastructure that supports the fiction of the white human is sustained
by antiblack violence. [The riot is an **ontological necessity**, not
just political cruelty.]{.underline} We can understand the grand jury's
decision philosophically: [[Being black is both the **cause** and effect
of violence]{.mark}, and when this being claims freedom, extreme
violence is always justified and necessary.]{.underline}

In Capital's chapter on the commodity Karl Marx argues that [a man-made
thing appears as a **commodity** when it is subject to
**exchange**.]{.underline} Later, in the passage of the so-called
"Dancing Table," which has been tremendously influential in theories of
fetishism,1 Marx describes the seeming 'transformation' of a mundane and
unproblematic sensuous object, such as a table, into a commodity. [[The
commodity]{.mark}, he writes, [is]{.mark} something [**supra-sensible**,
something beyond]{.mark} the table's tangible
**[materiality]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Among other things, the passage
addresses the way in which the concept of 'form' (in this case the
'commodity form' -- the fact that, when coming forth as object of
exchange, the table assumes the form of a commodity) emerges as a
principle of visibility: there is form when something appears as
something else. [The table doesn't change: it still has four legs, a
top, and it is still made of wood. But [what changes is the way it
exists in the **social space**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[No longer simply
a use value]{.mark},]{.underline} i.e. an object that is valued because
of the use that it can be put to, [[but an **exchange** value as
well]{.underline}]{.mark}.2 What interests me is that [Marx established
that [the commodity]{.mark} as such [is not a thing, but]{.mark} rather
[a **form**, a way of **being**]{.mark}, an appearance, the
**expression** of the thing's ability to exchange.]{.underline} This is
important because [[blackness has a very **intimate** relationship
with]{.mark} the [commodity]{.mark} form]{.underline}, one
[[rooted]{.underline} [in **slavery**]{.underline}]{.mark} of course,3
[but surviving [also in the way blackness has continued to **circulate**
in popular]{.mark}]{.underline} and visual
[[culture]{.underline}]{.mark}.4 This relationship, in other words, is
all but new and yet, what I think needs more attention is the concept of
form understood, in the Marxian sense, as a principle of visibility; as
the appearance of something---both in the sense of its 'coming into
visibility' and in the sense of the way something looks. Thus this essay
asks: when does the commodity black become visible as such? Or, more
precisely, what type of commodity is the one for which blackness acts as
principle of visibility?5 To pursue these questions this essay does not
concern itself with cinematic portrayals of blackness, i.e. it is not
about [blackness as a visual object in search of adequate
representation, but rather about blackness as a **language** and a
principle of **visualization**.]{.underline} This is so because I am
convinced that [[blackness---a]{.mark} most [carnal]{.mark} and at the
same time most [abstract **visual property**]{.mark}---can shed light
onto the contemporary **ontology of the visual**]{.underline}; it can
teach us something about the way in which we live with, understand, and
use, images. Race, in fact, continues to provide the most enduring
template for what constitutes a visible sign. My methodological premise
lies in something that Benjamin said about prostitution and that Stephen
Best has argued characterizes slavery even more, which is the fact that
the commodity celebrates its becoming human in the slave, in the attempt
to look at itself in the face.6 [The idea is that there is something to
be gained by looking not only at what happens to the concept of the
person when it can be commodified but also, conversely, at [what happens
to]{.mark} the concept of [the **commodity** when the **black**]{.mark}
**slave** [is counted as one.]{.mark}]{.underline}7 Therefore my
emphasis on the form of the commodity attempts to get at precisely this:
the way in which, in our contemporary moment, '[[black' gives
**form**]{.mark}---i.e. **appearance and visibility**---[to commodity
status.]{.mark}]{.underline} This also explains not only what set of
visual materials I focus on to begin to answer the questions posed by
this essay, but also how I look at them: not so much for what they show,
but for what face they put on, what sits on their surface, as it were,
what they wear on their sleeves. That blackness and whiteness are
distinct from black and white people is increasingly accepted today as
is the overwhelming self-referentiality of the images circulating in our
contemporary visual culture. And yet, racial images (and what
constitutes a 'racial image' is another concept that this essay puts
into play) are still affected by what in a literary context Henry Louis
Gates defined as a naturalist fallacy, i.e. the expectation that visual
signifiers of race are responsible for faithfully and authentically
representing 'black people,' rather than social relations.8 In other
words, visual signifiers of race are still taken at face value. Hence my
emphasis on form, appearance, surface, and face. Especially face, which,
as Kimberly Lamm suggests, is "an image suspended between the concept of
race and the physicality of the body."9 I begin with Spike Lee's film
Bamboozled because its use of blackface makes an explicit demand to
seriously engage with the film's surfaces. Blackface, in fact, is a very
specific kind of racial image, one created by the application of a
man-made signifier on top of the face: a black coating that functions as
the subject's interface. Blackface is obviously not a naturalistic
sign---it does not resemble anything or anyone---but rather a
second-degree signifier of race: it is an image of blackness as image of
race. Its referent is not black people, but the epidermality of race, in
other words, the fact that race's scopic regime is built on the
blackness of the skin. Through this leverage that the film employs
literally at the level of the plot, and metaphorically as a trope of the
relations of exploitation and commodification of blackness in the
entertainment industry, [Bamboozled argues that [the commodity]{.mark}
form [in contemporary]{.mark} material [culture has a face, and that
face is **black**.]{.mark} This is [because material culture is **still
determined** by]{.mark} the [commodity relations of **slavery**.
Bamboozled presents slavery]{.mark}, as Bill Brown puts it, not as a
historical phenomenon---a historical event that, occurred in the past
and has attained its closure---but rather [as]{.mark} a [**historical
ontology**,]{.mark} i.e. [an enduring **systemic**]{.mark} breakdown of
the [**distinction** between humans and things]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### The [modern whip is the Nike Logo]{.underline}---Blackness is intimately [tied]{.underline} to spheres of commodification and [exchange]{.underline} as a racial index of [valuation]{.underline}.

The Liberty Paint episode stages assimilation as the production of
whiteness via incorporation of the raw materials of blackness in a
manner that erases the traces of this very process. Lucius Browkway is a
ghost in the machine: he is an enabling black presence that augments a
white color capital. But whereas in Ellison, as per Harryette Mullen's
persuasive reading[, [whiteness is **manufactured** through]{.mark}
processes of **assimilation** dependent on black
invisibility]{.underline}, Lhamon's starting point is the contribution
to whiteness performed by the [[excessive **visibility** of blackness,
and their endorsement of such visibility]{.mark} in order [to display
their **refusal**]{.mark} to fit.]{.underline} Optic black, in other
words, is performative and deliberately exhibitionist.22 [What is [at
stake]{.mark}, then, [is]{.mark}]{.underline} not simply the performance
of demeaning images for purposes of subversion---what is often referred
to as the 'reversal of the stereotype' or, as Manthia Diawara,
commenting on the art of Michael Ray Charles, Kara Walker, and David
Levinthal puts it, the 'desire for' the stereotype23---but rather [[a
shift in the **location** of blackness from]{.mark} the sphere of
[**production** to]{.mark} the sphere of
**[exhibition]{.mark}**.]{.underline} While Ellison indicts a cultural
optics that spectralizes black labor for the production of a white color
capital, [the notion of **optic black**, instead, calls attention to the
fact that [blackness]{.mark} has become a visual signifier which
[becomes more **valuable** the more it is **removed** from]{.mark} the
sphere of [production. Blackness **severs** its connection to]{.mark}
black [labor, but once liberated]{.mark} from it[, acts]{.mark} instead
[as **currency** in the sphere of exchange.]{.mark}]{.underline} In this
respect, Bamboozled's great achievement is showing how [[blackness
**migrates** from]{.mark} the surface of [the body to]{.mark} the
surface of [**commodity culture** and beyond]{.mark} this [to]{.mark}
the vocabulary of [**capitalist** realism]{.mark},]{.underline} where
commodity culture attempts to look at itself in the face. The work of
Hank Willis Thomas claims a similar place for blackness. His photographs
are generally crafted to reproduce not only the aesthetic, but also the
intermediate plane of capitalist realism, slipping in and around our
consciousness just as advertising does, so that their commonplace
appearance, argues Rene de Guzman, "gives them the kind of legitimacy
accorded to things existing in the natural world." [This means that his
works' ontological claim to the real is dependent both on their ability
to **camouflage** as actual advertising and on sharing advertising's
**cumulative** effect]{.underline}---the insistence with which it
clutters our visual landscape.24 This is the case in a pseudo Master
Card ad (Fig. 6) crafted around the photograph of the funeral of
Thomas's cousin Songha Willis Thomas, inexplicably shot dead by another
black man who had just stolen his gold chain. Built and publicly hung as
a billboard, this image's deceptive face, fully compliant with the
aesthetics of other 'priceless' Master Card ads, encourages a distracted
reception, while the superimposed text quietly, but sternly, demands
that the viewer conjures up the horrible loss that lies beneath it. For
his UNBRANDED series25 Willis Thomas collected a number of print
advertisements from 1968 to 2008 featuring African American models or
directed at black consumers, and digitally removed their captions. The
goal was to show how blackness functions as a language through which
capitalist realism enables material relations to be rendered and
resolved as visual relations. Stripping these images of their
advertising text reveals the underlying work and trajectories of
desires. (Fig. 7) The fantasy structure that sustains the unholy
marriage between race and consumption comes to the surface and makes
black bodies appear central to the signification of capitalism,
sometimes simply as items within a color palette and other times as part
of a wish fulfillment (Fig. 8)---vital ingredients to the reproduction
and reaffirmation of a color capital that remains optic white.26 The
UNBRANDED series further superficializes a language that is already
entirely focused on its outer appearance and, just like blackface, has
no referent outside of its own economy of desire. In his earlier B®ANDED
series, instead, Hank Willis Thomas specifically interrogates the
[relationship of advertising images to [the visual archives of
slavery]{.mark}, which he **[re-animates]{.mark}** from within [the
icons of]{.mark} **contemporary** [**consumer**
culture]{.mark}]{.underline} (Fig. 9). As Robin Kelley puts it, Willis
Thomas is not interested "in blackface imagery; he draws on the archives
of slavery itself, which he then links to contemporary representations
of black men. Nor is he interested in artifice. What makes his work
resonate so powerfully is his ability to plumb the archives without
stripping the object/artifacts/texts of their historical moorings."27
[Of vital important to his project is the choice of the photographic
medium, which he employs in a historical perspective in order to both
reanimate and disrupt its role in naturalizing the **visuality of
race**]{.underline}.28 His work superficializes photography as well, in
order to dispute the way in which, [[historically and semiotically, the
photographic effect has come to **reinforce** the racial
effect]{.underline}]{.mark} -- the fact that as the photographic image
is conceived as a trace of the object before the camera (an index,
semiotically speaking) so black skin is read as a trace of 'race'.29 In
the B®ANDED series one has the sense that [[photography and race
are]{.mark} equally handled as a **[second skin]{.mark}**: none of them
is natural, but [both have been]{.mark} naturalized and [made to
**adhere** to the body]{.mark}.]{.underline} For Willis Thomas, in other
words, [[race is a form of]{.mark} political and [**economic
domination** that]{.mark} has become [incarnate]{.mark}d [in]{.mark} the
sense of [acquiring]{.mark} a [social]{.mark} (rather than biological)
**[materiality]{.mark}**]{.underline}.30 Hence he renders the enduring
ontology of slavery as a trace, which has and continues to visibly mark
the body---branding it, in fact. Scarred Chest, (Fig. 10) recapitulates
two very different but still connected iconographic traditions: on the
one hand Mapplethorpe's erotica then co-opted within an advertising
frame in Annie Leibovitz' photo of Dennis Rodman; on the other hand, the
abolitionist icon The Scourged Back -- an image widely circulated
because of its ability to index the brutality of slavery.31 [By
[substituting the whipping marks with the **Nike logo**]{.mark}, Willis
Thomas [constructs blackness]{.mark} and commodity culture [as]{.mark}
two competing [inscription]{.mark}s [of **value** onto the
body]{.mark}.]{.underline} The key concept being that [they are both
inscriptions -- iconic projections of a **socio-material**
**arrangement**]{.underline}, not intrinsic properties of the object.
[An image where race appears equally constructed by the blackness of the
skin and the branding of the brand foregrounds the ability of race to
'**attach'** itself to the body]{.underline}. By reanimating the
properly structure of slavery still contained within the contemporary
commerce of blackness as [[the]{.mark} primary form of [racial
index]{.mark}ing]{.underline} -- indeed by setting up against each other
photographic and epidermal indexicality -- Willis Thomas disrupts the
coincidence between photographic and racial index. In peeling one off
from the other, and inserting icons of consumer culture in their middle
(Fig. 11 B®ANDED "Absolut") he simultaneously challenges photography's
own reliance on its own face value. [In his work it is the commodity
form that takes the semblance of the index: it [brands,]{.mark} it
[acquires]{.mark} its own [**corporeality**, and]{.mark}, acting like a
second skin, it [becomes]{.mark} face [**value**.]{.mark}]{.underline}32

#### Around the globe, Blackness is [sold]{.underline} in the [marketplace]{.underline} of desire---a world of [social anxiety]{.underline} and anti-black [exchange]{.underline}.

But what happens when there is no face to speak of? When blackness is no
longer available as a visual object? As Harry Elam comments, the
increased visibility of [[blackness]{.underline}]{.mark}
[in]{.underline} [contemporary]{.underline} visual and [material
culture]{.underline} paradoxically [attests to a new and
**de-materialized** way in]{.underline} [which it [functions---as an
agent of **abstraction**.]{.mark} Blackness]{.underline}, in other
words, [seems [to **circulate** on its own]{.mark}, quite apart from
black bodies]{.underline} and consequently, from the history of black
people as well. In order to explore what guarantees this circulation, a
good number of artists (both black and 'postblack'33) have interrogated
this new stage of the commodity form of race by exposing its rules of
legibility in scenarios deprived of visual objects. I am thinking, for
example, about [conceptual cyber art such as damali ayo's
**rent-a-negro.com**]{.underline}, a website where it is seemingly
possible to rent a well-mannered African-American woman to be
accompanied at social events or simply to increase one's reputation; or
[Keith [Obadike's Blackness for Sale.]{.mark} The latter artwork [is
an]{.mark} ebay [**auction** of the artist's
blackness]{.mark}]{.underline}. In his product description, Obadike
claims, among other things, that [[the 'blackness' he is selling can be
used to create black **art**]{.mark},]{.underline} but not serious art;
it can be used to say the N-word without repercussions, but it is not
recommended while seeking justice or employment. [[It offers 'cool,' but
not fairness.]{.mark} Following [the rules of]{.mark}]{.underline}
engagement of [[the **marketplace**]{.mark} allows Obadike to [describe
the commodity blackness in its contemporary form]{.mark}, that is, [as a
**phantasmatic** entity]{.mark}---[valued for what it enables, both
discursively and socially.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Obadike
exposes]{.mark} a number of [factors that determine]{.mark} the variable
[**value** of blackness and offers to sell]{.mark}]{.underline}, just
like damali ayo, not what blackness is, but what it does. In these works
blackness does not pre-exist the act of exchange, but rather, [[it
exists as the **manufactured** product of a
transaction]{.underline}]{.mark} that the works themselves initiate.
Consequently, the works expose that racial identity is not lodged in a
pre-existing essence, but [it is rather reconfigured as a number of
possible subject positions in response to the art itself.34
[Blackness]{.mark}, then, [emerges as a structuring principle and a
**language** of social relations.]{.mark}]{.underline} By being openly
set forth in the form of a commodity, it offers, as Marx explains in his
opening chapter of Capital, the best vantage point on the capitalist
system as a whole. Blackness for Sale brings to the surface another
important sense in which the index speaks to the value of blackness, a
value that has become independent from its visual presence. In fact,
[Obadike's goal was to test the value of blackness in a **commercial
context**]{.underline} shared precisely with cookie jars and darkies
posters, but by withholding any image and just allowing consumers to
fantasize as to what blackness would mean to them: "many people" he
claims, "understand blackness as something that lives in the realm of
vision and because there was no photo on the auction page it gave room
for some to fantasize about how they would occupy this space."35 And
yet, [[blackness]{.underline}]{.mark} still [[functions]{.underline} [as
a principle of]{.underline}]{.mark} visualization,36 partly because it
operates in the context of what Michael Kaplan has [called
['**iconomics**:' the way]{.mark} in which [a **market index** measures
value]{.mark} as well as indicates the status of the system by providing
an image of the investors' feelings about it]{.underline}.37 In fact,
the market index is determined by, but also reflective of, the
collective opinion of the market participants: each investor speculates
about what others might be speculating about. Consequently, as a social
imaginary, iconomics is a system of simulation, whose only referent is
the feelings that people have about the system itself. Similarly, even
though it does not unfold through visual means, [[Obadike's art]{.mark}
work [functions **pictorially**, as an indexical
icon]{.mark}]{.underline}, because [it]{.underline} provides a picture
of a system that, having to face its own desires, is caught in the act
of looking at itself in the face. What artists such as Obadike and
damaly ayo show, according to Harry Elam, is that [blackness has reached
a new level of **abstraction** and it can now "travel on its own,
separate and distinct from black people." [Blackness]{.mark}, he argues,
[has acquired the status of **currency**: "blackness functions as
something]{.mark} that [you can]{.mark} apply, [put on, wear]{.mark},
that you use to assuage **social anxiety** and perceived threat: [the
desire to be included without]{.mark} the necessity of [**including**
black folk."]{.mark}]{.underline} The problem, Elam specifies, is that
"[it remains]{.underline} exceedingly [attractive]{.underline} and
possible in this post-black, postsoul age of black cultural traffic [[to
love black cool and not love black people.]{.underline}]{.mark}38 [The
fact that blackness can be made '**detachable'** from black
bodies]{.underline} -- where it was made to adhere by what had been
constructed as its natural, ontological, visuality -- [is an indication
of a new phase of development of the **commodity** form]{.underline},
what I will call blackness as phantasmagoria, i.e. the stage in which an
increasingly simulacral status of the visual develops its own,
[independent, social-materiality]{.underline}.39 The phantasmagoria was
a pre-cinematic device comprising a fully darkened room with a 'magic
lantern' placed behind a screen so that the screen and the apparatus
would be concealed from view; the audience only saw floating images
without anchorage in any specific place. This detachment of the visual
from the material is what Marx found useful to describe commodity
fetishism and what Benjamin relied on to articulate his notion of
exhibition value. However, as Tom Gunning points out, because the
phantasmagoria is based on a conscious deception of the senses, it
contains the possibility for its own de-mystification. [I introduce the
concept of **phantasmagoria** here because I believe it can offer
critical tools to [understand how blackness has transitioned]{.mark}
[from]{.mark} being [a bodily index to a **market index**; from]{.mark}
being the signifier of a [corporeal property to]{.mark} being the
signifier of [**speculative value**.]{.mark}]{.underline} It suggests
that blackness might be the signifier for the current ontology of the
image, one in which an increasingly simulacral status of the visual has
developed its own, independent, social-materiality. Finally, it allows
us to understand the current moment as another phase [in the journey of
blackness from the surface of the body, to the surface of material
culture]{.underline} [to]{.underline} where it is now---on [the surface
of the visual.]{.underline}

Complementing the traditional focus on production with greater attention
to [the growing significance of **consumption** within [global
**capitalism** provides new]{.mark} [directions for
understanding]{.mark} the experiences of [African American
youth]{.mark}.]{.underline} Black American youth are far from
marginalized [[within]{.underline} [a]{.underline}]{.mark} [massive
[global black]{.mark} [culture industry that uses their images to
**sell**]{.mark} a wide array of products]{.underline}. Moreover, [black
American youth]{.underline} also [constitute a **consumer
market**]{.underline} of their own [who will purchase music, alcohol,
drugs, cell phones]{.underline}, gym shoes, their own images [and other
products that are **created** **specifically** for them. [African
American youth are]{.mark}]{.underline} not marginalized but rather
remain [essential to new [consumer markets, both as
**suppliers**]{.mark}]{.underline} of commodities that are bought and
sold, [[and]{.mark} as reliable [consumer]{.mark} markets.]{.underline}
[African American youth are a **hot commodity** in the]{.underline}
contemporary [global]{.underline} [marketplace]{.underline} and global
media. [[Their images have **catalyzed** new]{.mark} consumer [markets
for products and services]{.mark}.]{.underline} The music of [[hip hop
culture, for example]{.underline}]{.mark}, follows its rhythm and blues
predecessor as a so-called crossover genre that is very popular with
whites and other cultural groups across the globe. [[**Circulated**
through film, television, and music]{.mark}, **news and advertising**,
[mass media]{.mark} constructs and [sells]{.mark} a [**commodified**
black culture]{.mark} from ideas about class, gender and
age.]{.underline} [Through]{.underline} a wide array of [genres ranging
from talk shows to feature length films]{.underline}, television
situation comedies to CDs, video rentals to cable television, [the
images produced and **circulated** within this area all aim [to
**entertain**]{.mark}]{.underline} and amuse [[a]{.underline}]{.mark}
highly segmented [consumer]{.underline} [[market]{.underline}]{.mark}.
This market is increasingly global and subject to the contradictions of
global marketplace phenomena.2 One implication of the significance of
consumption for understanding social class relations of black youth
concerns the constant need to stimulate consumer markets. [Contemporary
[capitalism relies]{.mark}]{.underline} not just
[[on]{.underline}]{.mark} cutting the costs attached to production, but
also on [[**stimulating** consumer demand]{.mark}.]{.underline} Just as
sustaining relations of production requires a steady supply of people to
do the work, sustaining relations of consumption needs ever-expanding
consumer markets. Moreover, [just as people do not naturally work and
must be encouraged or compelled to do so, [people do not engage in
excess consumption without **prompting**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this
context, [[advertising constitutes an important site that
**creates**]{.underline} [**demand** for
commodities]{.underline}]{.mark} [of all sorts.]{.underline} Marketing
and advertising often create demand for things that formerly were not
seen as commodities, for example, the rapid growth of the bottled water
industry, as well as for intangible entities that seem difficult to
commodify. In this regard, [[the]{.mark} rapid [growth of mass
media]{.mark} and new informational **technologies** [has
catalyzed]{.mark} a [**demand** for black culture as a
commodity]{.mark}.]{.underline} As the black culture industry
recognizes, most [market demand]{.underline} for products and services
[stems not from needs but]{.underline} rather from [unmet desires that
must be constantly stimulated.]{.underline} In this context, physical
addictions create ideal consumers who are willing to assume debt to pay
for their addictions. If consumers become addicted to tobacco, alcohol,
drugs or similar products, despite health risks, they can be counted on
to consume. As the repetitive behavior of shopping addicts suggests,
[the ideal consumer is]{.underline} one who is [addicted to
**consumption itself**]{.underline}, never mind the actual product or
service consumed. In this context, [[the interconnections among the
marketing of black culture, addictive behavior]{.mark} of consumers who
buy its products, [and]{.mark} any [consumer debt]{.mark} that ensues
[are **tightly linked**]{.mark}]{.underline}.3 Under this ever-expanding
impetus to create new consumer markets, [[nothing is exempt from]{.mark}
commodification and [**sale**, including the pain that African American
youth experience]{.mark} with **poverty and
powerlessness**.]{.underline} Nowhere is this more evident than in the
contradictions of rap. As Cornel West points out,'the irony in our
present moment is that just as young black men are murdered, maimed and
imprisoned in record numbers, their styles have become
disproportionately influential in shaping popular culture' (West, 1993).
In this context, [[rap becomes the only place where black youth
have]{.mark} public [voice, yet it is]{.mark} a public voice that is
**[commodified]{.mark}** and contained [by what]{.mark} hip hop
[producers think will sell.]{.mark}]{.underline} Despite these
marketplace limitations, rap remains a potential site of contestation, a
place where African American youth can rebel against the police
brutality, lack of jobs, and other social issues that confront them
(Kelley, 1994). Thus, [work on the black culture industry illustrates
how images of black culture function to catalyze
consumption.]{.underline}

###  Imprisoning of Black Bodies

#### \*\*Aff Idea: Prison Abolition\*\*

#### [Accumulation]{.underline} defines the condition of Black bodies in the system of [global capitalism]{.underline}. With the primal [theft]{.underline} of body through chattel slavery, civil society [characterized]{.underline} itself through the [sale and consumption]{.underline} of Black bodies. From the prison-industrial system to felon disenfranchisement laws, the sale of Blackness creates the body politics of [modernity]{.underline}.

[[The **actual bodies** of]{.mark} young [African Americans may also be
commodified]{.mark} as part of a new **black body
politics**]{.underline}. Here, the literature on gender and
globalization, especially the sex industry, is helpful in understanding
how a new black body politics might operate within relations of
consumption. Situating feminist analyses of body politics within
relations of production and consumption that characterize contemporary
globalization provides new avenues for understanding commodification and
the emergence of a new black body politics.4 [For Marx, all workers
under capitalism are **alienated**; they are **objectified** as they
sell their labor power to employers for a wage in order to survive. For
women, especially those in racial/ethnic groups]{.underline} as well as
in industrializing and developing countries alike, [good jobs are more
difficult to find.]{.underline} [Under these circumstances]{.underline},
some women do not sell their bodily labor to produce a commodity.
Instead, [[their bodies become **commodities**]{.mark}.]{.underline} In
a global context, as newly industrializing countries struggle to find
commodity niches in the global economy, they frequently find the best
niches taken. Consequently, [in some countries sex tourism becomes a
significant market fostering national economic development]{.underline}
and international capital accumulation (Wonders and Michalowski, 2001).
[[This]{.mark} new gender [scholarship offers a new]{.mark} [framework
for analyzing a new black body politics that African American youth
confront]{.mark}]{.underline} under conditions of globalization. In the
United States, [African Americans]{.underline} also [find the good jobs
taken and confront a similar issue]{.underline} [of the pressures to
commodify their bodies]{.underline}, especially if those bodies are
young. More importantly, this impetus to commodify black bodies is not
new. [[Chattel slavery]{.underline}]{.mark} in the American South prior
to and during the formation of the American nation state [clearly
[treated]{.mark} the [bodies]{.mark} of people of African descent [as
commodities]{.mark}.]{.underline} Objectifying black bodies enabled
slave traders and slave owners to turn black people's bodies into
commodities. [[Slavers assigned **monetary value** to black]{.mark}
people's [bodies, and then traded black bodies as commodities on the
**open market**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Some scholars on race have taken a
closer look at how the institution of chattel slavery accomplished this
process of objectification, commodification and exploitation. Literary
critic Hortense Spillers suggests that relations of slavery and
colonialism transformed understandings of black people's bodies.
Spillers identifies how ['[captive bodies']{.mark}, namely, the bodies
of **enslaved Africans**, [were severed from their agency]{.mark}, a use
of violence that eliminated gender]{.underline}: 'Their New World,
Diasporic plight marked a theft of the body -- a willful and violent . .
. severing of the captive body from its motive will, its active desire'
(Spillers, 2000: 160). [[This **theft** of the body]{.underline}]{.mark}
severed it from its own agency and thus [[formed the **moment of
objectification**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Spillers suggests that this new
objectified body became a canvas for racist discourse: 'These
indecipherable markings on the captive body render a kind of
hieroglyphics of the flesh whose severe disjunctures come to be hidden
to the cultural seeing by skin color' (Spillers, 2000: 61).
[[Once]{.mark} objectified and **[marked]{.mark}**]{.underline} in this
fashion, [slave owners and [slave traders treated black bodies as
commodities that can be]{.mark} **traded, [bought and sold]{.mark}** on
the open market. The treatment of actual bodies as]{.underline} objects
and subsequently as [commodities within **consumer
markets**]{.underline} as opposed to the appropriation of the labor
power that bodies contain [may be a]{.underline} more [fundamental
element of]{.underline} contemporary [capitalist]{.underline}
[economies]{.underline} than is commonly recognized. French sociological
theorist Colette Guillaumin lays the foundation for a different kind of
historical materialist analysis that rests on body politics (Guillaumin,
1995). Like traditional social class analysis, Guillaumin focuses both
on the economy (the exploitative dimension of appropriation for various
social systems such as slavery and social institutions such as
marriage), and on questions of power and domination. However,
Guillaumin's materialist analysis differs from traditional functionalist
and/or Marxist analyses of stratification/class. In contrast to
traditional social class analyses that begin with the sale of labor
power within capitalist relations, Guillaumin's materialist framework
originates in the appropriation of the body that contains the labor
power itself. Because no form of measuring the value of labor in
isolation from the body itself exists, Guillaumin contends that racism
and sexism both draw upon this physical appropriation of bodies.
[Guillaumin identifies [**slavery** as the fundamental]{.mark}
historical [relationship that fostered modern]{.mark} understandings of
[ideologies of race. Enslaving]{.mark} African bodies [constituted the
**original theft**]{.mark} -- [the stealing of labor came
later.]{.mark}]{.underline} Racial ideologies explaining this process
emerged after slavery was in effect. Guillaumin's theory of the sexual
oppression of women (her analysis of sexage) follows a similar logic.
For Guillaumin, the seizure of women's time, claiming the products of
their bodies such as children, mandating that women use their bodies to
fulfill a sexual obligation, requiring that women's bodies provide
physical care for children, the elderly, the sick as well as healthy
men, all illustrate how men as a class feel that they can appropriate
the bodies of women as a class. Guillaumin points out that [people only
publicly take that which they feel already belongs to them, as is the
case of the public harassment of women in the workplace and on the
street]{.underline}. Guillaumin provides a provocative piece of the
puzzle for constructing an argument concerning the commodification of
the actual bodies as well as representations of the bodies of African
American youth within contemporary global capitalist economies. [New
[forms of]{.mark} [commodification within]{.mark} the constant pressure
to expand [consumer markets **catalyze** a new]{.mark} black [body
politics where]{.mark} social class [relations]{.mark} [rest]{.mark} not
solely on exploiting labor power]{.underline} and/or mystifying
exploitation through images, [but also [on the **appropriation of
bodies** themselves]{.mark}]{.underline}. Whereas young black bodies
were formerly valued for their labor power, under advanced capitalism,
their utility lies elsewhere. Because bodies are not simply raced but
also gendered, [this new black body politics takes **gender-specific**
forms]{.underline}. In particular, beginning in the 1980s, the [[bodies
of]{.mark} young [black men became increasingly]{.mark} [appropriated by
the **prison system**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Typically,
[these]{.underline} alarming [rates of incarceration have been
interpreted as central to new mechanisms of **social
control**]{.underline} (Collins, 2004: 215--46). [[The]{.mark}
discipline]{.underline} [of]{.underline} young African American men that
lands so many in [[prison seems woven into]{.mark} the fabric of
[**everyday life**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Within large [urban areas,
[gangs, ghettoes, public schools]{.mark}, public housing [and prison
work together in a]{.mark} quasi-[**seamless
fashion**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Prisons]{.underline} [and ghettos gain
meaning from one another and both shape]{.underline} [**new racial
formations** within American society]{.underline} (Wacquant, 2001). On
one level, the growth of the punishment industry constitutes an
effective political response to this puzzle of idleness among young
black men as well as an effective mechanism for curtailing their
citizenship rights. If there are no jobs, one can hardly make them go to
them. Racial profiling and locking up men seemed designed to discipline
them into not challenging a system that treated them as throwaways. [The
issue of [felon **disenfranchisement** speaks to this need to discipline
black men]{.mark} through the prison system.]{.underline} In the early
2000s, [[48]{.mark} [states in the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [had
felon disenfranchisement]{.mark} laws.]{.underline} Under felon
disenfranchisement laws, [criminal offenders typically forfeit voting
rights]{.underline} as a collateral consequence of their felony
convictions. These laws appear to be race neutral, yet because young
black men are disproportionately incarcerated, these laws have a
racially disparate impact on this group. In a comprehensive study of
these laws, Behrens and Ugger conclude: our key finding can be
summarized concisely and forcefully: the racial composition of state
prisons is firmly associated with the adoption of state felon
disenfranchisement laws. States with greater nonwhite prison populations
have been more likely to ban convicted felons from voting than states
with proportionately fewer nonwhites in the criminal justice system.
(Behrens and Uggen, 2003: 596) Yet [the growth of [the **punishment
industry**]{.mark} also [illustrates how black male bodies are]{.mark}
objectified, [commodified]{.mark} and incorporated in service [to
maintain]{.mark}ing [prisons as **consumer
markets**.]{.mark}]{.underline} In essence, [[Black]{.mark} men's
commodified [bodies become]{.mark} used as **[raw materials]{.mark}**
for the growing prison industry.]{.underline} It is very simple -- no
prisoners, means no jobs for all of the ancillary industries that
service this growth industry. [Because [prisons]{.mark} express little
interest in rehabilitating prisoners, they [need a steady]{.mark}
[**supply** of bodies.]{.mark} The focus is less on appropriating the
labor]{.underline} of incarcerated black men (although this does happen)
[than in finding profitable uses for their **bodies**]{.underline} while
the state absorbs the costs of incarceration. If Kentucky Fried Chicken
found chickens in short supply, they would close and their profitability
would shrink. [The Kentucky Fried Chicken Corporation]{.underline} has
little interest in extracting labor from its chickens or in coaxing them
to change their ways. Rather, the corporation [needs a constant supply
of cheap, virtually identical chickens to ensure that their business
will remain profitable. In this way, [prisons]{.mark} made [use]{.mark}
of the [bodies of unemployed]{.mark}, unskilled young [black
men,]{.mark} the [virtually indistinguishable]{.mark} young [black men
who populate]{.mark} corners of American [cities]{.mark}.]{.underline}
The vast majority of young black people who are incarcerated by the
punishment industry are male, yet [it is important to remember that
disproportionately high numbers of young **black women** are also
incarcerated and thus are subject to this form of
commodification.]{.underline} Moreover, [young black women may also
encounter an additional bodily commodification of their
sexuality]{.underline}. The majority of sex workers may be female,
obscuring the minority of males who also perform sex work as well as the
objectification and commodification of black male bodies within mass
media as an important component of the sex work industry. [In essence,
[the bodies]{.mark} and images [of]{.mark} young [African Americans
constitute]{.mark} new [commodities that are **central** to
global]{.mark} relations of [consumption]{.mark}]{.underline}, not
marginalized within them.

###  Prostitution Economy

#### \*\*Aff Idea: Sex Work\*\*

#### The global economy of Black commodification [extends]{.underline} into the [sale and distribution]{.underline} of [sexualized]{.underline} Black bodies---the [raw material]{.underline} of the sex work industry.

Here, I want to take a closer look at this process by exploring how
[[sexuality has]{.mark} grown in [importance in the **commodification**
of the bodies]{.mark}]{.underline} and images [of black American
youth]{.underline} and how this [sex work in turn articulates with black
agency in responding to advanced **capitalism**]{.underline}. In
essence, [[black youth are]{.underline}]{.mark} now [caught up [in
a]{.mark} burgeoning **[sex work industry]{.mark}**]{.underline}, one
that is far broader than commercial sex work as depicted in the media.
Young [African Americans participate in the sex work
industry]{.underline}, not primarily as commercial workers as is
popularly imagined, but rather, [as [representations of commodified
black sexuality]{.mark} as well as potential new **consumer markets**
eager to consume their own images. [Racialized images of pimps and
prostitutes may be the]{.mark} commercial [sex workers who are **most
visible**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the relations of production, yet the
industry itself is much broader.5 A broader definition of sex work
suggests how [the sex work industry has been a **crucial** part of the
expansion of consumer markets]{.underline}.6 [[The]{.mark} sex work
[industry encompasses]{.mark} a set of social practices]{.underline},
many of which may not immediately be recognizable as sex work, [as well
as a constellation of [**representations** that create demand for sexual
services, attach **value** to such]{.mark} services, [**identify**
sexual commodities with race]{.mark}, gender and age-specific
individuals, [and rules that **regulate** this]{.mark} increasingly
important consumer [market]{.mark}]{.underline}. Feminists argue that
[[class, race]{.mark}, ethnicity, age [and citizenship]{.mark}
**categories**]{.underline} work to [[**position** women]{.mark}
differently [within]{.mark} [the]{.mark} global [sex]{.mark} work
[industry]{.mark}.7]{.underline} By far, [international **trafficking**
of women and girls for purposes of prostitution]{.underline} has
received the lion's share of attention. Here, [race, ethnicity
[and]{.mark} age [shape the commodification of women's bodies to
determine]{.mark} the **[value]{.mark}** placed on categories of sex
workers.]{.underline} The discussions of global prostitution and
trafficking of women highlight the exploitation of large numbers of
women, yet it is difficult to locate young African American women and
the sex work of young black men within this literature. In particular,
women who are not engaged in visible sex work or who do not show up on
crime statistics on sex workers are often considered outside the realm
of sex work. Here, I want to pursue a different argument, namely, [the
case that [sex work is **permeating** the]{.mark} very [fabric of
African American]{.mark} [communities]{.mark} in ways that resemble how
sex work has changed the societies of developing countries]{.underline}.
In essence, [poor and working-class African American youth increasingly
encounter few opportunities for jobs in urban neighborhoods while the
mass marketing of sexuality permeates consumer markets]{.underline}. In
this sense, [their situation resembles that of [black youth]{.mark}
globally who [confront]{.mark} similar pressures in response to
globalization.]{.underline} At the same time, [the situation of African
American youth is **unique** in that [the sexualized images that]{.mark}
they encounter [are of]{.mark} **[themselves]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In
essence, [[their own bodies]{.mark} often [serve as **symbols**
of]{.mark} this [**sexualized culture**, placing]{.mark} African
American [youth in the]{.mark} peculiar [position **claiming and
rejecting** themselves]{.mark}.]{.underline} How might this happen?

#### Consumerism [subsumes]{.underline} the [social fabric]{.underline} of Nigerian life. The global sex work industry [redefines]{.underline} Nigerian family values and puts Black female bodies up for [auction]{.underline} in the market of [exploitation]{.underline}.

[From the Bahamas to Cuba, Caribbean societies]{.underline} that
**[depend]{.underline} [heavily]{.underline} [on]{.underline}** tourism
recognize how important [sex work]{.underline} can be for local
economies (Alexander, 1997). These societies recognize how sex work has
been reconfigured within their domestic borders, especially following
[the]{.underline} Structural Adjustment Policies of the 1980s
(Emeagwali, 1995). Building on this literature, I investigate how
[reconfiguration of [the sex work industry within the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates has **[shaped]{.mark}** the domestic [relations within
African American communities]{.mark}]{.underline} generally and for poor
and working-class African American youth in particular. Nigeria, the
most populous nation state on the African continent, provides an
important case for building such an analysis. Reporting on patterns of
trafficking in Italy, [Eshohe Aghatise describes **[differential
mechanisms]{.mark}** used to [traffic women from East]{.mark}ern
[Europe]{.mark} [and Nigeria]{.mark} as well [as]{.mark} the
differential [**value** placed on women within]{.mark} Italian [**sex
markets**.]{.mark} The trafficking of Nigerian women and young girls
into Italy for **prostitution** began]{.underline} in the 1980s [in
response to]{.underline} Nigeria's [**economic** problems caused
by]{.underline} structural adjustment policies of [the]{.underline}
International Monetary Fund ([IMF]{.underline}) (Emeagwali, 1995). As
Agahtise points out: [[women]{.mark} and girls [started leaving
Nigeria]{.mark} for Europe [on **promises** of fantastic]{.mark}
well-paying [jobs]{.mark} to be obtained]{.underline} in factories,
offices, and farms. [[They arrived]{.underline}]{.mark} in Italy only
[[to find]{.underline} [themselves]{.underline}]{.mark} [lured into
prostitution]{.underline} [and [**sold** into sexual slavery to pay off
debts]{.mark}]{.underline}, which they were told they incurred in being
'helped' to come to Europe. (Aghatise, 2004: 1129) [Most Nigerian
victims of trafficking are illiterate]{.underline} and lacked any
exposure to urban life. The shifting patterns of economic and social
change within Nigerian society also contributed to the patterns of
trafficking. [Traffickers preyed]{.underline} not only on the poverty of
Nigerian victims, but also [on the breakdown of social and cultural
values [within Nigerian society]{.mark}]{.underline}, in particular,
[the]{.underline} disintegration of [[family]{.mark}
structures]{.underline} and a weak social welfare state. For many
families, [[send]{.mark}ing [female children abroad]{.mark} became a
status symbol: [Subscribing to a **consumerist model**]{.mark} that is
widely publicized]{.underline} on television and in magazines with
messages of high living in the West, and in the oral reports of
'been-tos' (a popular name in Nigeria given to those who have been to
Western Europe, Canada or the United States), many families believe that
it is easy to obtain wealth abroad, and that earning money, in whatever
way, will be quick. (Aghatise, 2004: 1132) Aghatise offers a especially
harsh criticism of a society that embraces consumerism and sells its
daughters to pay for it: The beginning years of Nigeria's economic boom
from petrol dollars left the legacy of a people who had acquired a taste
for a high standard of living and a consumer society that no longer had
the means to satisfy its purchasing habits but was not ready to admit or
accept it. (Aghatise, 2004: 1133) [[Trafficking of women and
girls]{.mark} to Italy [demonstrates the **fraying social fabric** of
Nigerian society]{.mark}, especially the ways in which women absorb the
pressures placed on families under changing public
policies]{.underline}. [Most of the women trafficked]{.underline} to
Italy [are from polygamous families]{.underline} from the Edo ethnic
group where wives are in a continuous struggle for a share of the family
resources for themselves and their children. [Even if men have jobs,
their earnings are **rarely enough** to provide for the needs of the
entire family]{.underline}. As Aghatise suggests: [because many men
continue to marry]{.underline} more than one wife, it is
[[women]{.underline}]{.mark} who [[are expected to assume more and
**more responsibility**]{.underline}]{.mark} for families . . . women
traditionally play an adhesive role in the social context of the Edo
ethnic group. The success or failure of a family in its individual and
collective projects is usually attributed to the women in the house.
Thus, the greater responsibility is implicitly that of the women.
(Aghatise, 2004: 1135) The worsening conditions within the Nigerian
economy, the weak welfare state, and cultural expectations of women
meant that women who were trafficked in the 1990s were mainly much
younger girls who set out on a job search to help their families.
Trafficking of girls and women is a problem, yet an additional issue
concerns the use of girls within domestic sex work markets. In a rare
analysis of how sex work is organized within a black society, Bamgbose
examines emerging patterns of adolescent prostitution in Nigeria. As she
bluntly claims, ['the truth is that in Nigeria, cultural values have
**broken down'**]{.underline} (Bamgbose, 2002: 569). Bamgbose describes
how [[the]{.mark} [global sex industry now **penetrates** into Nigerian
society: Adolescent prostitution is now out in the **open**]{.mark} in
Nigeria after decades of]{.underline} what has amounted to a
[cross-cultural conspiracy of silence]{.underline} . . . [[it has
assumed]{.underline}]{.mark} the proportion of [[a multibillion-dollar
industry with adolescents]{.mark} being [**sold and traded**
like]{.mark} other [mass-produced **goods**.]{.mark}]{.underline} It is
no longer restricted to certain parts of the world; [it]{.underline} has
penetrated into Nigerian society and [is now a thriving business in most
Nigerian cities.]{.underline} (Bamgbose, 2002: 571) Because the men who
[patronize [the]{.mark} sex [industry]{.mark}]{.underline} prefer
younger sex workers, young women more often service clientele, with
older women working as madams who procure the adolescent sex workers.
Offering a rare insight into adolescent sex work within an African
society, Bamgbose describes how the domestic Nigerian sex work industry
operates, one divided into a continuum of activities of the 'Sugar Daddy
Syndrome', 'night brides', 'floating prostitutes', 'call girls', and
finally, trafficking: Unlike the traditional prostitutes who are usually
older women, adolescent prostitutes start their careers in prostitution
in more comfortable hotel rooms or in a more sophisticated style. This
is what gave rise to the form of prostitution termed the 'Sugar Daddy
Syndrome'. (Bamgbose, 2002: 572) Under the Sugar Daddy Syndrome, young
girls patronize men, usually older in age, for sexual pleasure. Such
older men, who are wealthy, are usually referred to as 'sugar daddies'
or 'man friends'. They are the favorites of adolescent girls who seek
financial and material support in return for their services. The
duration of this relationship lasts longer than a one-night stand, and
the economic power wielded by such older and wealthy men, irrespective
of educational status, [[puts]{.underline} [the young
girls]{.underline}]{.mark} [involved [in]{.mark} a particularly
**[vulnerable]{.mark}** [position]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bamgbose, 2002:
572--3).

#### [Endlessly circulated]{.underline} images of [hypersexualized]{.underline} Black women [normalizes]{.underline} the economy of sexual exchange which constructs the "[modern Jezebel]{.underline}". In the US, this sexualization led to [spikes]{.underline} in HIV rates and [further commodification]{.underline} of female bodies.

be **tragic**.]{.mark} The **pressures** for young black women to engage
in [sex work have]{.mark} [affected the **rapid growth** of
HIV]{.mark}/AIDS [among poor black women]{.mark} in the Mississippi
Delta and across the rural South]{.underline}. [Between 1990 and 2000,
[Southern states]{.mark} with large African American populations
[experienced a **dramatic increase** in HIV infections among African
American women]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, [in Mississippi,
**28.5 percent** of those reporting new HIV infections in 2000 were
black women, up from **13 percent** in 1990. [In Alabama, the number
rose to **31 percent**, from 13 percent]{.mark}]{.underline}, whereas in
North Carolina, it rose to 27 percent, from 18 percent (Sack, 2001).
[Most of the women contracted HIV through heterosexual
contact]{.underline}, and most found out that they were HIV positive
when they became pregnant. The women took risks that may at first seem
nonsensical. Yet in the context of their lives [there was a sense that
[because they had]{.mark} so [**little control** over]{.mark} other
aspects of [their lives, they felt]{.mark} that [if God wanted them to
get AIDS, then they **resigned**]{.mark} themselves [to getting
it]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [These examples suggest]{.underline}]{.mark}
[that many young [African American women **resign**]{.mark} themselves
[to commodifying their bodies as a]{.mark} necessary [source of
**income**]{.mark}]{.underline}. They may not be streetwalkers in the
traditional sense, but [[they]{.mark} also [view]{.mark} commodified
[black sexuality as the **commodity** of value that they can
**exchange**]{.mark}]{.underline}. These relations also become difficult
to disrupt [in the context of a powerful [mass media]{.mark} that
defines and [**sells** images of sexualized black women as one
**icon**]{.mark} of seemingly authentic black culture. Young [African
American women encounter]{.mark}]{.underline} a set of [[representations
that]{.mark} **naturalizes and [normalize]{.mark}s** social relations of
[sex work]{.mark}]{.underline}. Whether [[she]{.underline}]{.mark}
sleeps with men for pleasure, drugs, revenge, or money, [the
**sexualized** bitch [constitutes a modern]{.mark} version of the
**[Jezebel]{.mark}**, repackaged for contemporary mass
media.]{.underline} In discussing this updated Jezebel image, cultural
critic Lisa Jones distinguishes between gold diggers/skeezers, namely,
women who screw for status, and crack 'hos', namely, women who screw for
a fix (1994: 79). Some women are the 'hos' who trade sexual favors for
jobs, money, drugs and other material items. [The female hustler, a
materialist woman who is willing to sell, rent, or use her sexuality to
get whatever she wants constitutes this sexualized variation of the
bitch]{.underline}. This image appears with increasing frequency,
especially in conjunction with trying to catch an African American man
with money. Athletes are targets, and having a baby with an athlete is a
way to garner income. Black women who are sex workers, namely, those who
engage in phone sex, lap dancing, and prostitution for compensation,
also populate this universe of sexualized bitches. The prostitute who
hustles without a pimp and who keeps the compensation is a bitch who
works for herself.

#### Black pimps and prostitutes [define]{.underline} the nature of global [racial capitalism]{.underline}---wherein Blackness is put up for sale on an [auction block]{.underline} and sold to the [highest bidder]{.underline}.

[[Black male involvement in the sex work industry
may]{.underline}]{.mark} not [[involve]{.underline}]{.mark} the direct
exploitation of black men's bodies as much as [[the]{.mark}
objectification and [commodification]{.mark} [of sexualized black male
images within **hip hop** culture]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [The
prevalence of **representations** of black men as pimps speaks to this
image of black men as sexual hustlers who use their sexual prowess to
**exploit** women]{.underline}, both black and white. Ushered in by a
series of films in the 'Blaxploitation' era, the ubiquitous black pimp
seems here to stay. Kept alive through HBO produced quasi-documentaries
such as [Pimps Up, Hos Down, African American men feature prominently in
**mass media**]{.underline}. Despite these media constructions, actual
pimps see themselves more as businessmen than as sexual predators. For
example, the men interviewed in the documentary American Pimp all
discuss the skills involved in being a successful pimp. One went so far
as to claim that only African American men made really good pimps. Thus,
the controlling image of the black pimp combines all of elements of the
more generic hustler, namely, engaging in illegal activity, using women
for economic gain, and refusing to work. [[Representations of black
women and men as **prostitutes** and **pimps** **permeate** music
videos, film and television.]{.mark} In]{.underline} the context of a
powerful [global mass media, black men's bodies are **increasingly
objectified** within popular culture]{.underline} [in ways that resemble
the treatment of all women. [Violence and sexuality **sell**,]{.mark}
and associating [black men]{.mark} with both [is]{.mark}]{.underline}
virtually [[sure]{.mark} [to please]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet [the real
struggle is]{.underline} less [about]{.underline} the content of black
male and black female images and more about [the treatment of black
people's bodies as **valuable** **commodities** within advertising and
entertainment.]{.underline} [[Because this new constellation of images
participates in **commodified global capitalism**]{.underline}]{.mark},
in all cases, [[representations of black]{.mark} people's [bodies are
tied to]{.mark} structures of **[profitability]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Athletes and criminals alike are profitable, not for the vast majority
of African American men, but for the [[people]{.underline}]{.mark} who
own the teams, control the media, provide food, clothing and telephone
services to the prisons, and who **[[consume]{.underline}]{.mark}**
seemingly [[**endless** images of pimps, hustlers,]{.mark} rapists, [and
felons]{.mark}]{.underline}. What is different, however, is how [[these
images]{.mark} of authentic blackness [generate]{.mark} additional
**[consumer markets]{.mark}**]{.underline} beyond the selling of these
specific examples of cultural production. [Recognizing the value of
commodified **black culture**, many African American [rap stars]{.mark}
have [start]{.mark}ed [their own]{.mark} record labels, clothing
[companies]{.mark}, and more recently, sports drink
divisions]{.underline}. [Their desire lies in sharing the **profits** of
a huge global consumer market of]{.underline} youth who purchase the rap
CDs, sports drinks, gym shoes, and clothing lines of [hip hop
culture]{.underline}. Take, for example, [the 2003 release of [Pimp
Juice, a]{.mark} new [sports]{.mark} [beverage]{.mark}]{.underline} that
was lauded by Vibe magazine as the best energy drink. Despite Pimp
Juice's claims that it provides vitamins and that its 10 percent apple
juice content makes it healthy, [the yellow and white design of its can
[resembles beer cans.]{.mark}]{.underline} Initially, [Pimp Juice was
[**marketed** within African American
neighborhoods]{.mark}]{.underline}, yet by 2004 Pimp Juice was
disseminated by 60 distributors in the United States, in 32 states and
in 81 markets. According to [[its]{.underline}]{.mark} distributor,
because [Pimp Juice is [flying off the shelves]{.mark} in the UK, the
Caribbean Islands, and Mexico]{.underline}, the distributor aims to sell
the product in Australia, Japan, China and Israel. The irony of this
particular product is that [[Nelly]{.mark}, the rap star whose [song
titled 'Pimp Juice']{.mark} helped resurrect the **popularity** of the
concept of the pimp]{.underline}, also owns the company that distributes
Pimp Juice. [This one product [illustrates the]{.mark} increasingly
[seamless relations among]{.mark} the [commodification of **black
images**]{.mark} (pimp/prostitute), [struggles between
**corporations**]{.mark} and hip hop capitalists (rap star Nelly) in
search of new consumer markets, [the expansion of new]{.mark} consumer
[markets]{.mark} (how Pimp Juice is marketed to black consumers),
[and]{.mark} potentially [new systems of **control** within]{.mark}
African American civil [society]{.mark} that grow from the same
conditions that sparked changes within Nigerian society]{.underline}.
Beverage makers claim that pimp juice is a benign sports drink --
www.letitloose.com, Pimp Juice's official web site describe it as a
'healthy, non-carbonated energy drink possessing a tropical berry
flavor' -- yet when Black American youth buy pimp juice at their corner
store, they most likely are singing the lyrics Nelly's song 'Pimp Juice'
while they pay \$1.89 for one can of actual 'Pimp Juice'. The lyrics of
Nelly's song 'Pimp Juice' make it clear what pimp juice really is and
who it is for. Nelly opens his song by boasting that because his woman
only wants him for his 'pimp juice', he needs to 'cut her loose'. He
then moves on to describe the power seats, leather and sunroof of his
pimpmobile. When 'hoes see it', according to Nelly, they 'can't believe
it'. Nelly knows their game and puts them out, telling them to dust
their shoes off so as not to touch his rug. For those who still don't
get it, Nelly ends his song with a rousing definition of pimp juice:
'your pimp juice is anything, attract the opposite sex, it could be
money, fame, or straight intellect'. Always an equal-opportunity kind of
guy, [Nelly proclaims, 'bitches got the pimp juice too, come to think
about it dirty, they got more than we do'. By itself, the song 'Pimp
Juice' is just a song. Yet when coupled with [the music video of]{.mark}
Nelly representing a pimp and **mass marketing campaigns** that [put
cans of]{.mark} actual [Pimp Juice in corner stores]{.mark} for young
African Americans to see and buy, [the circle is
**complete**]{.mark}]{.underline}. African American youths' encounters
with Pimp Juice comprise the case examined here, yet [the new
commodities and new consumer markets in this example point to much
**larger issues**. [The hip hop capitalism of Nelly's]{.mark} brilliant
[marketing]{.mark} of 'Pimp Juice' [illustrates how sexualized
understandings of black]{.mark} women's and men's [bodies and culture
become]{.mark} marketed and [**put up for sale** **in the global
marketplace**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It also focuses on new consumers of
bodies and images, in particular, how [[black people become target
audiences for their **own degradation**]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g. the
case of pimp juice) as well as Nelly's plans to go global with this
popular product. When it comes to the commodification of black bodies,
few African Americans celebrate the criminal justice system. At the same
time, [when it comes to the commodification of images associated with
prison culture as well as an array of **products** that seemingly signal
a seemingly authentic black culture, blacks are well represented among
the consumers of these images.]{.underline}

For over 30 years western feminists have had powerful and deeply
divisive debates about the roles of pornographic media and sexual
commerce in promoting heterosexist institutions and social relations.
These debates, which became known as the 'Sex Wars', exacerbated many
bitter philosophical divisions between feminists (Duggan and Hunter,
1995). Touting Robin Morgan's catchphrase, '[[Porn is the theory, rape
is the **practice'**]{.mark}, (Morgan, 1980) radical, anti-pornography
feminists defined pornography as the 'graphic and sexually explicit
**subordination** of women through pictures and/or words']{.underline}
(Dworkin and MacKinnon, 1988: 36). According to their argument,
[[porn]{.mark}ography [represents the 'subordination of women
**perfectly** achieved']{.mark}]{.underline}, (Dworkin, 1993: 523) [[as
it commodifies rape, and]{.mark} endorses and [encourages men's
**abusive** sexual desires]{.mark} and behaviors towards
women]{.underline} (Russell, 2000: 50). Alternatively, anticensorship,
liberal, and sex-positive feminists identified pornography as a
convenient but hazardous scapegoat for attacks on sexual dissent, and as
a complex discourse 'full of multiple, contradictory, layered, and
highly contextual meanings' (Duggan and Hunter, 1995: 7). Even within a
heterosexist system of domination, they argued, [[oppressed
groups]{.mark}, such as women and sexual minorities, [view
porn]{.mark}ography in a multiplicity of ways, [often
counter-appropriating]{.mark} seemingly [**exploitative** material and
positively transforming their meaning]{.mark}.]{.underline} Although
largely a heteronormative capitalist mode of production, [pornography
nevertheless offers women and men, consumers and participants, spaces
and possibilities for counter-appropriation, self-expression, pleasure,
and labor]{.underline} (Kipnis, 1997; Weitzer, 2000). On the margins of
the Sex Wars, African American [feminist [scholars have
written]{.mark}]{.underline} a great deal [[about]{.underline}]{.mark}
the issue of [[sexual representation]{.mark}, focusing [on the
exploitation of black women's bodies within patriarchal, **racial
capitalism**]{.mark} in the USA. [They]{.mark} have examined how African
American women's sexualities [are]{.mark} inherently [informed
by]{.mark} the [**objectification**]{.mark} of their bodies
[necessitated by]{.mark} the **sexual economy** of
[slavery,]{.mark}]{.underline} [and black women's own historical efforts
to reclaim their bodies and define their **womanhood**.]{.underline}
These writers explain how [black women have challenged dominant
imaginings of black sexuality as pathological, explaining also their
attempts to achieve sexual autonomy in the face of the widespread
discourse of black sexual deviancy]{.underline} (Hobson, 2005; Rose,
2003; SharpelyWhiting, 2007). Yet, for black women, defining sexual
autonomy has not been an easy task. First, what Evelyn Brooks
Higginbotham (1993) terms [[a 'politics of **respectability'**
has]{.mark} historically [discouraged black women from creating a
**framework** for sexual subjectivity outside of
heteronormative]{.mark}, domestic, and [bourgeois family
relations]{.mark}]{.underline} (White, 2001). Many black queer scholars
(Johnson and Henderson, 2005; McBride, 1998; Stallings, 2007) have noted
the difficulty in addressing issues of sexual subjectivity, due to what
Matt Richardson notes as [[the]{.mark} 'erasure of a broad array of
black sexuality and **gendered being**, in favor of a static
[heterosexual narrative']{.mark}]{.underline} (Richardson, 2003: 63). In
addition to the politics of respectability, historian Darlene Clark Hine
(1989) [[proposes]{.mark} black women possess [a]{.mark} 'culture of
dissemblance', a culture of **masking, silence, secrecy**, and
[**disavowal** of sexuality in black women's lives,]{.mark} employed [as
a]{.mark} [method to **protect** them]{.mark} from sexual
injury.]{.underline} Unfortunately, [[these]{.mark} twin cultural
[traditions]{.mark} frame sexual deviance as dangerous and [marginalize
women who deviate from **respectability**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
dissemblance [by participating in non-normative
sexualities]{.underline}, including queer, contractual, or public
sexuality (Hammonds, 1997; Stallings, 2007). According to Evelynn
Hammonds (1997), 'The restrictive, repressive and dangerous aspects of
black female sexuality has been emphasized by black feminist writers
while pleasure, exploration, and agency have gone under-analyzed' (1997:
385). Those black feminist scholars who have written about pornography
tend to find affinity with radical feminists, deeming the form
inherently dangerous for women -- especially black women. For example,
Patricia Hill Collins (2000), Alice Walker (1980, 1981), Tracy Gardener
(1980), Luisah Teish (1980), and Aminatta Forna (2001 \[1992\]) contend
that [sexual violence is 'typically or implicitly a theme of
pornography']{.underline} (Collins, 2000: 135). Though violence and
misogyny towards black women in pornography, [sex work and elsewhere is
a critical and extremely painful concern]{.underline}, the theoretical
equivalence made by scholars between pornography and violence remains
troubling. Pornography is framed as a monolithic cultural production and
industry and is blamed for the degradation and violation of black women,
rather than situated as a historically complex, dynamic media genre. As
Linda Williams (2004a: 12) notes, pornography is a 'genre for the
production of sexual viewing pleasure' -- including, potentially, black
women's own pleasure.

#### A [framework]{.underline} of the [illicit erotic economy]{.underline} uncovers the [creative and productive]{.underline} elements in a world of [sexual capital]{.underline}. To [survive]{.underline} and prosper, Black women own their [sexual deviancy]{.underline} through transgressions of cultural and social [norms]{.underline}.

While some hardcore images are misogynistic, violent and racist, not all
pornography is such. [If we look]{.underline}, for example, [at
pornography created by black women such as Vanessa Blue, Diana Devoe,
Venus Hottentot, or Shine Louise-Houston, we see **erotic expression**
that is much more **creative** and **pleasurable** than many critics
might suspect]{.underline}.3 [As producers and consumers, women
participate in pornography's **sexual economy** in ways that suggest
that its consubstantiation with violence and subordination should be
**re-evaluated**]{.underline} (Chapkis, 1997; Duggan and Hunter, 1995;
Juffer, 1998). [[We should]{.mark} also **[interrogate]{.mark}** [how
pornography addresses]{.mark} the sexual [desires]{.mark}, fantasies,
fetishes and expressions [of black]{.mark} sexual
[subjects]{.mark}]{.underline} as well the presumed white male
voyeuristic consumer. [[It is crucial to]{.mark} take [account]{.mark}
of the deeply problematic [issues of **racialized sexism** in
porn]{.mark}ography]{.underline} as a media genre and industry,
[[while]{.mark} at the same time [**uncovering** the voices]{.mark} and
experiences [of black erotic laborers]{.mark} as they mobilize their
sexualities for pleasure and profit.]{.underline} Illicit Eroticism [in
a Global Economy of Sex Work]{.underline} In a globalizing economy where
[media industries and [**sexual** **commerce** offer]{.mark} avenues for
mobility and [profit]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bernstein, 2007; Ehrenreich
and Hoschchild, 2002), [[black women are finding]{.mark} new ways to
employ **erotic embodiment** by putting sexuality to work]{.underline}
in often informal, illicit economies of sex (Achebe, 2004; Collins,
2006; Kempadoo, 1999, 2005). Noting their complex eroticization in
[transnational racial economies of desire]{.underline}, Kemala Kempadoo
asserts that, 'the sale of sexual labor is an integral part of many
working Third World women's lives and strategies' (Kempadoo, 1998: 124).
Through my research on black women in the US porn industry, I developed
[[the paradigm of '**illicit erotic economy'** as a way to
theorize:]{.mark} (1) [the **historical representation** of black bodies
as sites for]{.mark} a vast array of [forbidden sexual desires]{.mark},
fantasies, and practices, [and]{.mark} (2) [how black subjects
symbolically]{.mark} and strategically [labor within the]{.mark}
prohibited **[terrain of sex]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Taking the lead
from the work of Sharon Harley (2002) on African American women's use of
underground economies during the early 20th century, [I [consider
illicit eroticism as a **framework** to understand how]{.mark} [black
subjects labor in the **sexual economy**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
[Reflective of African Americans' historical engagement in informal,
**underground**, illegal, and quasi-legal income generating activities
-- [from prostitution to pimping]{.mark}, drug dealing, music and movie
pirating, street **performance**, and childcare -- [illicit eroticism
offers black women]{.mark} who are marginalized in the formal labor
market [ways to **survive** **and prosper**.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}Encompassing a range of informal and intimate labors, [illicit
[erotic workers employ their **sexual capital**]{.mark}, talents, and
knowledges [to]{.mark} perform sexual service work on 'the margins' of
an economy increasingly focused on the **commodification** of
intimacy]{.underline} (Agustin, 2007: 21; Zelizer, 2005). More than
survival skills, [illicit eroticism [eschew]{.mark}s the [logics of
sexual **respectability**]{.mark}, dissemblance, and normativity. [Black
women in porn]{.mark}ography [transgress multiple]{.mark} moral,
[cultural]{.mark}, and social [boundaries as they]{.mark} [mobilize
their **outlaw**, racialized sexuality for
work]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [They use the demand for their
mythic hypersexuality as a vehicle to]{.underline}, as Luise White
suggests in her research on prostitution in colonial Nairobi, to
'[reproduce themselves and their dependents']{.underline} (1990: 12).
One performer underscores this point -- black women in pornography labor
for their families: 'I have always had a family to take care of, in some
fashion or another. I have no idea what it is like to earn all my money
and keep it all'. Historian Robin D.G. Kelley (1997) argues that this
[selective appropriation of [**selfcommodification** is]{.mark} both
[strategic and creative]{.mark} in its engagement with capitalism:
African Americans have mobilized self-commodification through the
**transformation** of leisure, pleasure, and creative expression into
labor]{.underline}. [[Black sex workers transform]{.underline}]{.mark}
what Kelley defines as 'labor not associated with wage work -- [[sexual
play]{.mark} and intercourse -- [into **income'**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(1997: 73). [This 'play-labor']{.underline} (1997: 45--6) is not
necessarily resistant to hegemonic institutions of power, nor is it
meant to be. It [is one strategy by which young people]{.underline},
women, minorities, Third World subjects, the working-class, and others
[navigate the capitalist political economy by using their corporeal
resources]{.underline} -- resources that may be the only ones they can
control. Participating in a continuum of sexual labor -- [[from dating
to]{.mark} erotic massage, streetwalking, escorting, modeling, [exotic
dance]{.mark}, phone sex, internet porn, S/M domination, [or]{.mark}
performing in [sex films -- black women **strategically maneuver**
the]{.mark} illicit [erotic economy to promote their survival, autonomy,
and well-being]{.mark}.]{.underline} According to my research, women are
motivated by what is considered relatively flexible and high-income work
offering increased opportunities for self-care, and a sense of
recognition for their erotic embodiment and sexual talents. Some enter
the industry on a casual basis, to pay for rent, childcare, school fees,
family bills, or a car, while others seek careers in the sex-obsessed
entertainment industry and see adult entertainment as a stepping-stone
to something else. For many women, fame vis-á-vis [the adult industry is
seen as a viable, if defiant, aspiration --]{.underline} [one that
reflects what cultural critics have noted as the '**pornification'** of
popular culture]{.underline} during the last 15 to 20 years (Paasonen et
al., 2007). [This kind of sexual visibility could reflect a desire by
young black women to harness the subjective power of eroticism made
popular by black actresses, entertainers, and sexual outlaws like Pam
Grier, Lil' Kim, or Josephine Baker.]{.underline}

#### In the [sexual marketplace]{.underline} Blackness is a [devalued commodity]{.underline} of sexual [fantasies]{.underline} sold in a [commercial empire]{.underline} of white idealism.

**Miller-Young '10** (Mireille Miller-Young, Professor at UCSB, "Putting
Hypersexuality to Work: Black Women and Illicit Eroticism in

During seven years of ethnographic forays into adult industry worksites
-- including film sets, production offices, business conventions, awards
ceremonies, and industry events -- I observed many instances of blatant
disregard for black women. Like their locations in the back and on the
margins of the most important adult entertainment business convention in
the world, Adult Video News' Adult Expo, black women's place in the
commercial hardcore industry is peripheral and precarious. [[Black women
are **systemically** positioned in]{.mark} spaces and [roles of
**lesser**]{.mark} [importance to white women, who are valued as the
most **prized commodities** in the **sexual marketplace**]{.mark} of
hardcore.]{.underline} [Women of color]{.underline} generally [occupy a
diminished space in comparison to **idealized** white adult performers,
yet black women seem to be most disparaged]{.underline}, and as a
consequence, vulnerable to the kinds of verbal and symbolic violence
that I witnessed at the Adult Expo. In an industry that values and
trades in the sexuality of women, one would think that black women's
presumed hypersexuality would give them an advantage. In fact,
paradoxically, it is just the opposite. Like the cruel comments of the
director I overheard, [rather than being valued for their erotic skills,
black women are devalued as '**skanks'**.]{.underline} If black women
are so derided in the adult entertainment industry, why do they enter
it, and what do they make of entrenched racism and heterosexism within
the business? Considering the devaluing of their representations and
labor in pornography, I investigate how [[black women put their
**hypersexuality** to work for their own interests in **survival**,
success and erotic autonomy]{.underline}]{.mark} (Alexander, 2005).
[[Hierarchies of value organize the **production, distribution, and**
**consumption** of pornography media, in]{.mark} addition to structuring
work and labor relations in the adult **entertainment industry**.
According to [this]{.mark} logic of [sexual economy]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Davis, 2002), [[some bodies are **worth more** than others; yet all
are]{.mark} evaluated and [commodified]{.mark} through the lens of race,
gender, class, and, sexuality.]{.underline} Although these valuation
regimes are presentin most social and economic institutions and
relations in our society, they are iterated in explicit detail in
hardcore pornography, where [[erotic desires and fantasies are
**commercialized**]{.mark} in a \$12--14 billion dollar per year US
industry that spans the globe]{.underline} (Johnston, 2007). While the
diversification of the sex industries -- including people, products,
services, and technologies -- has transformed and expanded both
productive and consumptive practices, [the hegemony of whiteness in
defining human capital (including erotic value) **disadvantages** people
of color. The black female body is]{.underline}, in relation to other
racialized and gendered bodies in the flourishing sex industries,
[**devalued and marginalized** [in pornography's]{.mark} hierarchal,
[sexual marketplace]{.mark}]{.underline}. While many scholars have
theorized about how gender informs pornography's sexual representations
and labor relations, there is a paucity of research on how [[race forms
a **matrix**]{.mark} of power [that shapes the practices and]{.mark}
[principles of the adult entertainment industry in its visual
representation as well as its structural and social
relations]{.mark}]{.underline} (see Bernardi, 2006; Shimizu, 2007;
Williams, 2004b). In this article I examine the structural inequalities
and social biases black women face in the adult industry. Through the
oral testimonies of these workers, this study reveals that black women
in adult entertainment sustain incisive critiques about how hegemonic
whiteness impacts their conditions of labor, including earnings,
employment opportunities, and erotic embodiment. Responding to these
intersecting racial and gender hierarchies of valuation, black women sex
workers (Leigh, 1997) grapple with the devaluation of their bodies and
sexual labor, sometimes through the creation of pornography that
represents their own desires. [[What can we learn from black sex
workers' **utilization of hypersexuality**]{.mark} and
selfcommodification as they live and labor within advanced
capitalism?]{.underline} Given feminists' entrenched battles over sexual
representation and commerce, I consider the key challenges and concerns
about elucidating black sex workers' supposedly deviant or
counternormative behaviors. I illuminate black women's intimate labor in
hardcore and their struggles for survival, success, and sexual agency.
In my research methodology, which combines feminist methods of
ethnography, oral history, archival and textual analysis, [I situate
[black sex workers]{.mark} as critical knowledge producers and cultural
workers actively laboring to [create space in the sexual marketplace for
a **self-defined** black female sexuality]{.mark}]{.underline}. Engaging
black women working day to day in the sex industry, looking specifically
at their needs, experiences, challenges, and desires, [I argue that it
is precisely through women's **own discussions** of their
representations and labor in the sexual economy that we can analyze the
complexities and ambiguities of black women's experiences of pleasure
and danger, exploitation and disenchantment.]{.underline} Our
methodologies should consider how black women's labor in the sexual
economy indicates their attempts at survival, mobility, self-authorship,
and self-care (Cohen, 2004; Foucault, 1990 \[1978\]).

#### Whiteness occupies the [most valuable]{.underline} sexual capital that situates Blackness within the [sexual market]{.underline} as a [hyper-disposable]{.underline} repulsive object of exchange.

Hypersexuality to Work: Black Women and Illicit Eroticism in

What do black women sex workers have to say about the kinds of
challenges to erotic autonomy they confront as they carve out space
within a deeply racialized and gendered sexual economy? In my study,
[black professional adult actresses have been vocal about issues of
**wage inequality**, employment marginalization, and interpersonal bias,
even as they assert their autonomy in choosing to work in the
**pornography industry**]{.underline}. In an industry that treats most
sex workers as disposable, [[black women]{.mark} are the most devalued;
they are [**hyper-disposable**. The perceived easy accessibility of
black]{.mark} women's [sexuality organizes how]{.mark}]{.underline}
hardcore [[media produces and **markets** black female bodies]{.mark} as
well as how it treats black women workers at worksites.]{.underline} I
want to foreground the voices of black women professional sex workers to
understand the function of gendered, racialized, sexuality in the
political economy of adult entertainment with regards to black female
bodies. [Black female bodies are **devalued** [in a]{.mark} [sexual
marketplace that reifies whiteness]{.mark}, especially white
femininity]{.underline} (Nagle, 1997). [[The]{.mark} young, blonde,
lithe, busty, [white woman is constructed as the most valuable **sexual
commodity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As seen at the AVN Adult Expo, [white
women's bodies are the **primary currency** of the]{.underline}
multi-billion dollar adult entertainment [business]{.underline}. They
are the focus of companies like Vivid, Hustler, and Wicked, and they are
the 'cash cows' for an industry that is immensely lucrative for major US
corporations such as AT&T, TimeWarner, and DirectTV that profit from
selling hardcore over pay-per-view cable channels, video on demand, the
internet, and in millions of hotel rooms each year (PBS Frontline,
2001a; PBS Frontline, 2001b). [Although they are fetishized for their
difference, the bodies of [women of color hold much **less
currency**]{.mark} for these corporations [because they receive
significantly **less demand**]{.mark} compared to white female bodies.
[The devalued status]{.mark}]{.underline} of black female bodies
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} significantly [[evident in **wage**
**inequalities**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and this is one of the sorest
issues for black women sex workers in the business. Concentrated in the
bastardized niche genres of black and interracial porn, [[black
actresses have]{.mark}]{.underline} largely [[been]{.underline}]{.mark}
both [[hired less and paid half]{.mark} to three quarters [of what
white]{.mark} female [actresses earn]{.mark}. Black women]{.underline}
contractors for professional companies [are currently paid
\$400--\$900]{.underline} for one 'boy/girl' sex scene, depending on
their notoriety and the company's film budget, while [white actresses
tend to be paid \$1000--\$2000]{.underline}. (Vanessa Blue, 13 August
2008). [Black]{.underline} professional [adult actresses identify
the]{.underline} problems of [pay inequality as part of a wide-ranging,
**exploitative**, and racist devaluation of their labor]{.underline}.
Actress Lola Lane pointed to the inequality and pay: 'I think I am still
not getting equal to what the other girls are getting' (Lola Lane, 10
January 2003). After years in the porn industry, Lola Lane succeeded in
demanding a higher rate from producers than when she started, but she
still felt that it was not equal to white women's pay rates. Sierra,
another professional adult actress and exotic dancer described the ways
that workers lack the knowledge of wage rates that intensifies racial
inequality: The thing is salaries aren't discussed and \[producers\] try
to get you right then and there. You have to negotiate your own salary .
. . I've talked to \[black\] girls who've gotten \$300--400 to do a
scene. I'm like \$300 is all you got? I won't even leave my house for
\$300. You must be crazy! I've known a lot of white girls that come into
the business and get started with regular straight scenes and get \$1000
. . . [Unfortunately, most of us entering this business don't know what
we're worth]{.underline} (Sierra, personal interview, 28 April 2003).
[[Vulnerable to exploitation by pornographers looking for]{.mark} the
next [new talent]{.mark} [at]{.mark} the **[cheap]{.mark}est** cost,
[young women]{.mark} entering the sex industry [are hurt by a culture of
**silence**]{.mark} about wages, exacerbated by a stigmatized and
complex field of work]{.underline}.5 While their age and lack of
knowledge about industry standards for actresses sometimes places them
at a disadvantage, full-time, professional actresses also battle to
maintain their careers in a climate that favors younger women (Diana
Devoe, personal interview, 11 January 2003). As indicated by one African
American adult industry executive, the inequality in pay is the 'primary
issue' for black actresses, and 'knowing that you could have gotten
more, is really disappointing' (Anonymous, personal interview, 5
December 2002). Beyond the issue of wages, [[these]{.mark} contract
[workers feel]{.mark} an [extreme pressure to **conform** to high
standards of whiteness]{.mark} in order [to win]{.mark} opportunities
such as film roles, marketing and PR agreements, and [long-term
contracts. The rule tends to be: live up to the requirements of white
sexual embodiment]{.mark}]{.underline}, in other words,
[**[assimilate]{.mark}** [to white **beauty standards**, or risk being
ghettoized]{.mark} in the most undervalued sectors of the
business,]{.underline} such as the low-end genre of 'ghetto porn'
(Sinnamon Love, personal interview, 5 December 2002). For Lola Lane the
obvious racism embedded in the privileging of white femininity was
painful: You know I've been booked for shoots and they think I'm white
over the phone, (because there's another Lola) and they say 'Oh you're
the black girl. We can't shoot you', or 'Your butt is too big'. So it
can hurt your feelings (Lola Lane, personal interview, 10 January 2003).
[This construction of [beauty]{.mark} and desirability [is]{.mark}
inherently [defined by what it is not -- the **deviant** and repulsive
black]{.mark} woman's [body]{.mark} -- has very real, economic
implications for women of color sex workers]{.underline}. As Lola's
testimony shows, the preference for white actresses and [the
stratification of opportunities along the color line creates a
tremendous sense of **disappointment**, frustration and injustice among
black actresses]{.underline} as they are left out of potentially
lucrative opportunities to work. You have to get that tough skin or
you're not going to make it, otherwise you get low self-esteem. You are
like 'Hey, what's wrong with me?' I go to these casting calls . . . and
they are only looking at the white girls. It's like, 'Why am I here?'
You find it humiliating (Lola Lane, personal interview, 10 January
2003). [Lola's feeling of [constantly feeling **measured**]{.mark}
[against an unattainable]{.mark} and cruel [standard of beauty]{.mark}
and femininity [is something many black women]{.mark} in America [face
everyday]{.mark}]{.underline} (Craig, 2002[). A deeply emotional process
of confrontation, pain, and self-hatred -- and sometimes
counter-hegemonic resistance and healing -- black women must negotiate
their unalterable difference and the overriding **stigma** of being a
racial Other in an industry that funnels the cultural capital of white
beauty as the primary economic **capital** of its workers]{.underline}.
According to Angel Kelly (personal interview, 20 April 2003), 'Black
women are always feeling measured by white beauty standards, and
increasingly the skinny and plastic'. Indeed, [[many]{.mark} of the
professional adult [actresses]{.mark} I interviewed had [responded to
the pressure]{.mark} to look like ideal porn stars [by having]{.mark}
some form of [**plastic surgery**.]{.mark} The increasing employment of
black women [that look like]{.mark}]{.underline}, as black adult actor
Byron Long (personal interview, 10 January 2003) [puts it, 'chocolate
[Barbie dolls']{.mark},]{.underline} has meant that black women with
more voluptuous and natural bodies tend to be seen as less attractive,
more disposable and are marginalized in niche markets like ghetto porn,
BBW (Big Beautiful Women), and fat porn. They do not appear in higher
status hardcore feature films produced by the top companies and
directors. Those women who defy the politics of disposability and fight
for a longer career in the industry attempt to project what one
production executive calls 'crossover appeal'. According to professional
adult actress Sinnamon Love (personal interview, 5 December 2002), '[the
farther away they are from the natural, voluptuous figure of a black
woman, the better it is, and the more likely they are to get the
jobs'.]{.underline} [The process of [demanding black women appear white
while]{.mark} they are still [represented as **exotic** Others]{.mark}
[sustains the **fantasy** of difference for]{.mark}]{.underline}
presumably [[white male consumers]{.mark} without disrupting the racial
order. This systemic **hierarchy of valuation** shapes working
conditions and challenges the legitimacy of [black]{.mark} women [sex
workers]{.mark}. They [must work within]{.mark}]{.underline} limited
[categories]{.underline} defined and [regulated by [a racial **economy
of desire**]{.mark}]{.underline}; those that do not fit within the
categories are kept out with evasive excuses: 'We can't shoot you right
now, but as soon as we're shooting something, we'll call you'. This was
what an employer told performer Stacy Cash (personal interview, 10
January 2004) when she called to inquire about bookings. 'But if you
send in a picture of a girl that is lighter than you', she added, 'then
they'll shoot her. It depends on what their preferences are . . . you
have to work within the category that you are in'. Stacy is not alone in
experiencing the pain of rejection due to racism and colorism -- in fact
[she is part of a global economy of desire that uses, but also
discriminates against, black and brown women]{.underline}. Kemala
Kempadoo proposes we acknowledge that, 'even with the heightened
exoticization of the sexuality of Third World women and men, they are
positioned in the global sex industry second to white women' (Kempadoo
and Doezema, 1998: 11). [Whiteness is the hegemonic ideal of
**attractiveness and desirability**, Kempadoo argues, 'and white sexual
labor is most valued within the global sex industry']{.underline} (1998:
11).

of a **[racialized sexual economy]{.underline}**, focusing on gaining

**hyperaccessible and [superdisposable]{.mark}** []{.mark}in an industry
that simultaneously invests in and marginalizes fantasies about black
sexuality]{.underline}. As black women labor to make the presentation of
their presumed hypersexuality work for them, they face a myriad painful
choices and challenges. In light of feminist arguments that these women
are victimized by an alienating and exploitative sex industry, I have
attempted to show that [[black]{.mark} illicit [erotic workers,]{.mark}

[employ an **outlaw sexuality** to achieve mobility, erotic autonomy,

our studies so that they engage not just with the images that the
hardcore industry sells, but the women that are working hard to be seen
and heard. The informants in this study feel further alienated by
feminist scholars that talk about them, but not to them, and who see
them as colluding with misogynists rather than carving out a vital space
for black women to see themselves as desirable and desiring subjects.
[These women's **narratives** about and critiques of racism and sexism

**White '16** (Micah White, editor at Adbusters whose essays and
interviews have been published in the New York Times, The Guardian
Weekly and Folha de Sao Paulo. Widely recognized as a pioneer of social
movement creation and has been profiled by the New Yorker, and Esquire
has named him one of the most influential young thinkers alive today. He

Protest: a New Playbook for Revolution*)

Most of contemporary activism is voluntarist. The essence of voluntarism
is the belief that the actions of individuals can change the world. The
basic idea is that certain collective social behaviours have a unique
political power. Voluntarism is based on the assumption that voluntary
actions are the dominant factor in revolution and that the primary
challenge for activists is to get large numbers of people to choose the
correct behaviours. This means that activists emphasize their free will,
believing that their decision to act can overcome other structural
factors that may make revolution seem impossible. For the philosopher
Slavoj Zizek, voluntarism is defined by "the belief that one can 'move
mountains,' ignoring 'objective' laws and obstacles. Voluntarists have
total faith in the power of action. Voluntarist activists believe that
collective action can overcome all odds. Or, according to Alexander the
Great, "There is nothing impossible to him who will try." Once this
assumption has been made, the primary challenge becomes determining
which actions to advocate. The possibilities are limitless, and to
narrow the choice voluntarist activists have created many secondary
theories to explain why they've chosen this protest tactic over another.

Activists urge people to "take action" because voluntarists believe
political reality can be changed through direct action, the exertion of
direct pressure through any unmediated action, such as strikes,
blockades, or demonstrations designed to achieve immediate results, as
distinguished from indirect actions such as negotiation, lobbying or
constitutional processes. Voluntarists often think of activism as a
ladder of engagement that begins with non-action and passivity and
climbs toward activity with direct action at the pinnacle. The goal is
to escalate engagement up the ladder. Action, individual and collective,
is the ideal. Voluntarist activists would never accept, for example,
that doing nothing (i.e., the absence of action) could yield greater
intended political change than doing something-anything-unless the act
of doing nothing, like being silent or refusing to work, was publicly
performed as protest. Activity, the willful intention to change the
world, is necessary for activists who eschew passivity, inner
contemplation and theoretical speculation in favour of being practical,
applied and empirical.

Until the explosion of political activism in the 1960s, an unconscious
voluntarism (in the sense that actions were chosen haphazardly) was the
norm. Crowds adopted unruly behaviours spontaneously and then spread
them. Consider, for example, the Nika Revolt of AD 532 that nearly
toppled Constantinople. This spontaneous incendiary riot probably came
closer to overthrowing a world power than any riot in human history.
There was no conscious theory guiding the event. It just happened,
leaving many historians wondering whether the Nika Revolt was a
political protest or just a bout of hooliganism. Likewise today,
whenever we are unsure if a popular unrest is revolutionary, it is often
a sign that the people are being unconscious in their choice of tactics.
Conscious voluntarism emerged later in history when the crowd began to
understand itself as a coherent social movement whose coordinated
actions had political implications. Consciously voluntarist activists
think strategically in terms of tactics, campaigns and movements.

The publication of William Gamson's The Strategy of Social Protest in
1975 was a milestone for conscious voluntarism. Gamson, a sociologist,
took an empirical approach to studying protest. He compiled a database
of protest groups in the United States between 1800 and 1945. He then
took a random sample and looked for patterns behind contesting group
success. The result was ironic: Gamson's conclusions were
ccounterintuitive, and the most important pattern that he identified
ignited a furor of opposition to voluntarism.

The first counterintuitive conclusion that Gamson came to is that
protest groups do not increase their odds of success by working on
campaigns that many other groups are also tackling. On the contrary,
according to Gamson, "having many other challenging groups in the field
at the same time does not seem to have much effect on the probability of
success of any given challenger." This is good news for solo activists
and unconventional movements because it frees us from working on popular
campaigns whose efficacy we question. Coalition building is an activist
cliché presumed to be mandatory to success. And these coalitions, often
funded by foundations, tend to overdetermine the aims and targets of
contemporary activism. Sometimes activists assume that working together
and getting other groups "on board" is crucial to campaign progress.
Gamson's historical analysis of challenging group success refutes this
assumption. The founding of Occupy Wall Street, which emerged from
Adbusters in Canada rather than the many groups in the United States who
were working together to get money out of politics and bring income
inequality into the mainstream discourse, corroborates Gamson's
findings.

Once conclusion above all defined Gamson as a voluntarist catalyzing
fierce opposition to The Strategy of Social Protest, He discovered in
the data proof that the likelihood of success increased when protesters
embraced certain actions. Good news for the core assumption of
voluntarism. Unfortunately, after extensive statistical research, the
end result was a clear endorsement of violence. Gamson discovered that
one of the actions that had a significant positive impact on the
probability of success was adopting violent tactics. "Unruly groups,
those that use violence, strikes and other constraints, have better than
average success," Gamson reports. This was unacceptable conclusion in
1975, a year when urban guerrillas like the Red Army Faction were taking
hostages, bombing buildings and executing politicians. It would be going
too far to say that Gamson advocated violence; instead, he embraced the
empiricism of voluntarist activism and reported what the saw in the
data.

At the same time as the core voluntarist tenet-actions make change-was
vindicated, activists were put in an ill-favoured position of advocating
violence as the most effective form of action. You may dismiss Gamson.
Or you may try to make the counterintuitive argument that contemporary
forms of non-violent direct action are a less lethal form of violence
that still fits Gamson's definition of the effective use of violence.
Either way, the ideal of non-violence takes a hit from the possibility
that political reality will only be altered violently, rather than
through the repertoire of peaceful tactics.

Contemporary revolution theory has moved forward. The defeat of the Red
Army Faction in Germany, the Red Brigades in Italy, the Weather
Underground in the U.S. and others who embraced violence stands as a
historic warning. The theory of facoism, the idea promulgated by Fidel
Castro, Che Guevera and Regis Debray that mobile groups of armed
guerrillas can spark a broad-based revolution by roaming rural areas and
committing sporadic acts of anti-government violence, was a disastrous
failure in Bolivia and elsewhere. At the same time, violent groups have
a tendency to be infiltrated by agents provocateurs or front groups for
use in false-flag operations. And regardless of whether the data suggest
the efficacy of violence for contesting groups between 1800 and 1945,
the twenty-first-century activist's repertoire is distinctly non-violent
and often performative, directed toward garnering media attention. "One
way of thinking about the most visible actions in the social movement
repertoire is to consider them as performances directed at certain
audiences," writes the sociologist Hank Johnson. Volntarist
action-oriented protest today is mostly, but not always, about appealing
to spectators through public events.

Mental environmentalism is the solution to the impasse plaguing
mainstream environmentalism. The traditional alliance between
environmentalism and technocrats has effectively alienated the world
from the environmentalist struggle. When scientists dictate the aims of
activists, the result is a brittle materialist conception of protest
that is unable to deal with the fluid ecological crisis-a crisis that is
above all existential.

The first credible scientific warnings about catastrophic climate change
emerged in the 1970s and have grown persistently graver since. As long
as corporations were able to dictate the domestic policies of Western
democracies, reckless economic growth would be pursued, whatever the
data told us. So activists waited for big-bang apocalyptic
events-historic storms, melting ice caps, record-breaking heat waves,
species extinctions-that would signal the catastrophe and shift public
sentiment. Yet each of these dreaded events happened quietly, and the
world still seemed to function. Few of us understood that the real
apocalypse would be subtle. We kept waiting, only to realize in a flash
that the dreaded event had already happened: the world has tipped past
that point of no return that we had been fearing. As of 2015 the global
concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere now exceeds 400ppm.
And scientists say that the warming of the oceans is unstoppable. "Even
if we were to freeze greenhouse gases at current levels, the sea would
actually continue to warm for centuries and millennia, and as they
continue to warm and expand the sea levels will continue to rise,"
acknowledges a U.S. government climate scientist in July 2015. The
climate calamity is in the past. And now we need a fundamental
reorientation in our approach to environmental activism. We must reshape
humanity's internal reality in order to restore our external reality.

Ever since the catastrophic storms started, there have been prophecies
of an environmentalist movement that would materialize in full force.
Many people woke up in the mid-twentieth century with the publication of
Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, which warned of the dangers of DDT. For
others it was the first photos of Earth taken from space, or the live
video of BP's underwater oil well rupturing into the Gulf of Mexico in
2010.

Of the many battlefronts on which our global struggle will be fought, it
is the ecological struggle that has the greatest potential to unite
humanity. From an ecological perspective, all the species that thrive on
Earth are essentially one organism: either we all win or we all lose.
Despite the dreams of lifeboat survivalists, it does not matter if you
have a backyard bunker stocked with a decade of provisions. No one can
outlive the eternal consequences of climate change.

Climate change is a unique challenge because it is a force outside human
control that will compel our species to adapt. Either we will adapt
toward a utopian vision that benefits the many or toward a dystopian
vision that benefits the few.

For environmentalism to fulfill its universalist political promise, it
must abandon the technocratic approach that has dominated the ecological
paradigm for decades. There has been a fetishization of our ability to
correlate climate change with scientifically verifiable hypotheses.
Environmentalists got stuck in proving the scientific argument and have
been falling down the rabbit hole of computer models and intellectual
abstraction ever since. We are in a situation that the French
philosopher Jean-Francois Lyotard calls the "differend": an irresolvable
language game in which the absolutely final proof of climate change is
human extinction...but of course by that point there will be no one
alive to verify the final proof. Scientists believed that their computer
models could prove without a doubt the veracity of climate change. But
pursuing this kind of total rational proof of a phenomenon that exceeds
human conceptual capacities is the wrong course for activism.

I think we have forgotten that the power of Silent Spring-the way it
captured the attention of so many readers-does not lie in the valid and
profound science of bioaccumulation that Rachel Carson pioneered but in
the beauty of the opening chapter; "A Fable for Tomorrow": "There once
was a town in the heart of America where all life seemed to live in
harmony with its surroundings." Carson paints an idyllic picture of a
pastoral community known for its fertile agriculture and thriving
biodiversity: "Along the roads, laurel, viburnum and alder, great ferns
and wildflowers delighted the traveler's eye through much of the year."
And then, as in a fairy tale, Carson describes a sudden calamity, the
beauty is lost-an "evil spell settles on the community," an invisible
malady spreads across the land. Flocks of chickens die, vegetation
withers and ultimately nature grows silent. If this were a different
author, perhaps the people would have solved the crisis by offering
sacrifices to the gods or praying for help. Instead, Carson moves away
from blaming supernatural forces. She sees an exclusively natural cause
for the crisis. The "evil spell" is not a spell, after all. "No
witchcraft, no enemy action had silenced the rebirth of new life on this
stricken world." Carson concludes, "The people had done it to
themselves."

Modern environmentalism originated in an imaginative fiction about a
cursed land. This beginning has been largely repudiated by mainstream
environmentalism that has chosen scientific facts over the fantastical,
spiritual approach. Environmentalism has thus become an empirical
expedition largely regulated by Western scientists who tell us how many
ppm of carbon dioxide will trigger an apocalypse (350 ppm, says
environmentalist bill McKibben, co-founder of 350.org) and how many
degrees hotter our Earth can be before we are collectively doomed (20 C,
says the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). To move forward,
environmentalism must end its obsession with materialism.

Environmentalism is a story we tell ourselves to interpret unusual
natural phenomena. Whereas previous generations interpreted calamities
like plagues and storms as portends from God, we see these events as
signs of climate change and proof of the guilt of human civilization.
And while it is true that human activity is the primary cause of climate
change, it is time for a new storyline. Climate change is happening
because of the state of our minds.

Environmentalism is first and foremost an existential and spiritual
question. The ecological crisis is a matter of survival on the species
level. Without our Earth, the future dies: we die, and we doom our
descendents. An ecological uprising is vital to the perpetual
continuation of life. Environmentalism is an elemental struggle, the
most dangerous kind because any attempt by authorities to decrease our
freedoms can be conceivably justified by the severity of the ecological
crisis.

I am haunted by an eco-facist nightmare. I see the return of human
slavery on a global scale after industry scientists demonstrate that
human labour is the most sustainable source of energy. Building on
energy efficiency calculations that were carried out when the memory of
American slavery was still fresh, scientists could prove conclusively
that an energy slave fed a minimal diet is "greener" than any known form
of non-renewable and renewable energy resource. The big agriculture
companies will tell us that feeding high-yield genetically modified corn
to the indentured is the most efficient way to generate electricity. And
the rising costs of fossil fuels will make energy serfdom, slavery and
indentured servitude economically logical. The virtues of 100 percent
employment overnight will be touted. We will see people chained to
bicycle-powered charging stations for the elite's electric vehicles. The
honeybees will die off and the crops will need pollinating; a few
million conscripted people will be forced to pollinate by hand. Slave
labour will be relied on as the economic pressures of climate change
became too great. The propagandists of the old American South were very
convincing at the time, with stories of how humanely slaves were
treated: one postcard even boasted of the free medical care and
retirement that slaves enjoyed. Slavery has existed throughout history,
and many of the great civilizations tolerated the practice. How long
until the argument is made and insidious advertising sways a fearful
public desperate to mitigate climate change?

The ecological catastrophe will deepen and political leaders across the
political spectrum will no longer deny climate change. They will see the
political advantages of proclaiming themselves ecological saviours and
of speaking in global terms. They will know the benefits of maintaining
an emergency, or disaster capitalism, as the author and activist Naomi
Klien calls it. They will ration commodities and defend a wartime
climate-change economy that justifies every authoritarian gesture. They
will be on every screen. And they will engineer elections to win many
votes.

I am concerned about the potential for scientific-oriented
environmentalism to flip into a dark force in our world. I foresee that
great tragedies could be carried out under the technocratic ecological
flag. To join politics with catastrophic environmentalism is dangerous.
It will attract the most power hungry...and the most calculative. Their
lifeboat mentality will be the pretext for genocide and enslavement. And
yet, some kind of universal ecological politics is absolutely necessary
for the survival of humanity.

If we look with clear eyes at the world today, we see that it is so
deeply interconnected that any viable solution to the challenges we
experience individually will require, at least partially, a globally
implemented agenda. Carbon emissions will need to be regulated in every
place on Earth if we are going to weather the climate change storm.
There is no hope if China were to shovel the coal more slowly while
Canada continued to devastate Northern Alberta. Irreversible climate
change. The last gasp of capitalism. The spiritual crisis of
ultramodernity. The existential threat we face is now no longer
individual but inherently global. People power has not kept pace with
the transformations wrought by hyper-capitalism. The necessity of a
universalist politics is more clear than ever. But so too are the
filings of every universalist project to date.

To block the rise of the eco-fascists, there must be no "I' who will be
the savior. Anyone who claims to be a Green Caesar is after something
far more sinister. The saving grace will only come from a "We." Either
the people become the voice of a new kind of global environmentalism-a
mental environmentalism that shifts how we perceive the world-or the
basest ego instincts will rule. Our selfless We shall mitigate the
ecological crisis for the benefit of all. From the outset, we see that
the pre-existing structures of global governance-the United Nations, the
WTO, IMF and World Bank-will not get the job done. Even if, as the
political activist Ralph Nader once dreamt, the super-rich were to
suddenly switch sides and throw their tremendous capital behind our
vision, they would find that apparatuses built for the conquest of
Mammon are rotten beyond repair when it comes to mobilizing the people
on a global scale. There are those-the transhumanists, in particular-who
believe humanity can prosper on a dead planet. In Synthetic Worlds,
Edward Castronova imagines that humanity can thrive in virtual worlds,
computer-based simulated environments, hooked up to machines and cared
for by artificial intelligences. The number of transhumanists is growing
because the alternative-yielding power to a global bottom-up people's
insurrection-would end their prestige and way of being. Those who claim
we don't need the Earth are no better or more trustworthy than the Cold
War technocrats who counselled a terrified public that it would be
possible to survive global nuclear war. There is blackmail inherent in
technocrats' reassurances-a promise that until the end of time, no
matter how bad it gets, their way will be the only way. You are the ones
who will call their bluff. The people are looking for a path forward. We
stand at the pinnacle of the greatest danger, and yet it is only from
our precarious position that we can leap to safety. Pressure is
building. May the urgency of our moment force us to jump.

One signature of ultramodernity is the uneven distribution of
temporality. Some humans are living in an immersive cybernetic reality
while others carry on old beliefs and ancient customs. Just as each of
us perceives time differently, so too do all the beings that inhabit our
world.

Consider the example of the housefly. Flies see the world in slow
motion, a scientific paper in Animal Behaviour reports. To arrive at
this conclusion, scientists in Ireland used the "critical flicker fusion
frequency" test (CFF) to determine the time-interval perception of
dozens of animals. The idea behind CFF is simple. Imagine a strobe light
whose pulses slowly increase until it looks as if it is emitting a
constant "fused" light. Some animals perceive flickers of the strobe at
intervals much shorter than you and I. A housefly, for example, can
detect four flashes where a human sees only one light. And other
species, such as the European eel and the leatherback turtle, perceive
one light when humans see four distinct flickers. The ability to detect
flickers correlates with the perception of time. The housefly
experiences time more slowly than humans, and we experience time more
slowly than the European eel. Scientists found that "smaller organisms
and those with higher metabolic rates perceive temporal change on finer
timescales." They suggest that time perception is a factor in species
differentiation that helps us understand predator-prey relationships.

Studying the temporality of flies reveals lessons for the predator-prey
relationship of protest and power. The speed differential between
species means that our world comprises many temporal niches. We may
occupy the same space but we do not occupy the same time. Each organism
is able to perceive actions only within its temporality. By moving
faster than other species in the same space, weaker species "encode
information in high-frequency signals that can be detected by intended
receivers such as \[others of the same species\] but that are not
susceptible to 'eavesdropping' by (generally larger) predators." In
other words, from the perspective of activism by moving ultrafast or
ultraslow in relation to power, protesters gain protection through
invisibility. Where a nimble group of activists perceives four flashes,
metaphorically speaking, a large police bureaucracy perceives only one.
The Internet allows social movements to form, flicker and evolve faster
than the response time of authorities.

Going one step further, the fastest reaction time of a typical human is
one second. It will take you that long to "notice potential danger and
physically react," says a separate study in Scientific Reports. "Even a
chess grandmaster requires approximately 650 milliseconds just to
realize her king is in checkmate." In the article entitled "Abrupt Rise
of New Machine Ecology beyond Human Response time," scientists express
concern about the recent emergence of financial algorithms operating on
stock exchanges that move in sub-second time scales invisible to humans.
They point to the troubling increase in "ultrafast extreme events"
(UEEs) that coincides with the start of the global economic crisis in
2008. These UEEs are dramatic price fluctuations that occur faster than
human perception. Extreme financial events are imperceptible. Their
consequences, however, are profound in the offline (real) world. One day
we will have ultrafast extreme protest events.

Flies, humans and financial algorithms have a minimum reaction time
based on their metabolic rate. So too does the "social organism"-the
cultures, networks and institutions of our society. Like the humans that
compose them, large corporations and state bureaucracies take time to
react to emerging protest movements.

The fast future of activism takes place in this gap. Next generation
movements exploit differentials in time perception by moving ultrafast
in relation to the status quo. The speed of youth networks allows new
protest behaviours to arise and be disseminated before older, slower
structures notice. Temporal arbitrage-turning the differential between
time scales into an advantage for protesters-is one of future social
movements' greatest strengths. The fast future movements will be
designed to emerge and withdraw in under a lunar cycle so as to triumph
before the status quo and law enforcement mobilize to react.

The future of protest is also slow. Future movements will re-conceive
activism in time scales of centuries, not seconds, by focusing their
meme warfare on provoking epiphanies in people who are not yet born.
From the perspective of a long-term vision, today's protests aren't
failing: our protests are setting in motion a victorious process that
will take generations to unfold. Activists must be patient and willing
to wait hundreds of years, just as the early Christians endured
persecution until a rare cosmological occurrence triggered the
conversion of Constantine. Contemporary activists tend to overestimate
the effect of a protest in the short run and underestimate the effect in
the long run. Activists of the future will privilege tactics designed to
impact the world a hundred years after their death. Theurgist protesters
will prophesy a future event, like an earthquake, that converts the
powerful to their cause by signaling the righteousness of the movement.
And all of us will act today in ways designed to spark epiphanies in the
minds of the next generation.

The slow future of protest is the one that Thomas Jefferson refers to in
writing, "The generation which commences a revolution rarely completes
it." Others have estimated that every revolution takes three
generations. Revolution is akin to building a cathedral in medieval
Europe. The architects who designed it and the masons who built it did
not live to see their work completed. Notre-Dame de Paris, for example,
took a hundred years to complete. It is the same with revolution. As you
are not able to choose which part of the multi-generational cycle you're
born into, it may be that you will live your entire life in preparation
for a revolution that your grandchildren will finish. The slow future is
the deep-time perspective that traces the continuity of struggle back to
the earliest days of antiquity and into the furthest stretches of what
is to come.

Slow time is composed of the memories, myths and stories that guide our
action. Activists of the future will situate their struggle within the
five-thousand-year-long and ongoing story of liberation that began
before Ipuwer's lament in ancient Egypt, continuing through the Arab
Spring, Occupy Wall Street, Idle No More, Black Lives Matter and the
social uprisings that followed. This is a prophetic storyline in which
you play a destined role. The future of protest is a slow movement that
ensouls the people with a new spirit, a new hope. And in this future the
gods roam and political miracles are possible.

Fast protests will always occur. And they may grow in frequency, too.
But repeated, isolated fast events cannot make a revolution alone. The
slow storyline is what grants these events meaning, continuity and the
strength to liberate. I trace this story of protest through the prophets
of the great religions as well as the great political revolutions.

One strength of Internet-enabled meme warfare has been its swiftness.
However, protest memes will evolve from their current primitive state.
The meme is much more than a contagious idea. Dawkins, an atheist and
critic of religion, merged "gene" with "mimeme," meaning "intimated
thing," to explain how culture is transmitted. Dawkins saw that memes
underpin the essence of humanity-our complex and evolving culture. Slow
memes of the future will transmit nuanced social behaviours to
self-aware social movements. These behaviours will exceed single,
repeated protest actions. Imagine instead contagious memes that carry
sophisticated behaviours of collective liberation through techniques of
self-governance, new cultural rituals that are protests because they
transmit new ways of living together.

Tomorrow's activists will leverage prophetic yearnings for a grand
transformation into an epic uprising. Memes of the future will go beyond
critique to provide a revolutionary formula for interpreting natural
phenomena in divine terms in order to win elections, administer cities
and build a World Party.

The people's war is asymmetric. In the streets protesters face an
adversary equipped with great resources, armoured and intending to
terrify. If this were an arm-wrestling match, we would reasonable expect
a crushing defeat. Fortunately for social-change creators, revolution
often favours the weak. In his 2005 book, How the Weak Win Wars: A
Theory of Asymmetric Conflict, the military historian Ivan Arreguin-Toft
undertakes a statistical analysis of conflicts since 1800 in which one
side had ten times the resources or more. In doing so, he discovers two
fundamental principles of war. The first principle is that over time the
weaker adversary wins more frequently. Weaker forces are more likely to
win today than they were in 1800. In fact, since 1950 the weaker side
has won more often than lost. This trend will continue; the ad vantages
of being weaker, smaller and nimbler are growing. The second principle
is the most important of all: the weaker adversary tends to win
conflicts when they innovate. If the weaker refuses to mimic the
stronger adversary's actions, they win 63% of the time. In essence, if
we innovate, we win.

The first step toward protest innovation is detachment from our current
repertoire of tactics. This detachment is achieved by an understanding
of the reasons behind our actions. Most people don't spend a lot of time
thinking about how to pull off a revolution. Outside of military
schools, there are few classes on the practicalities of insurrection. A
world-class university library might have half a dozen books, at best,
that try to pass on the art of rising up. I've spent weeks scouring the
University of California, Berkeley's main library, one of the top five
largest libraries in North America, only to find a small shelf of
tactically outdated books, mainly published in the 1930s or the 1970s,
on the topic of how to shake off an undemocratic regime. The library is
full of books critiquing society, of course.

Many of us spend a lot of time thinking and writing and debating about
why we should revolt. There are countless articles from everywhere on
the political spectrum that advocate insurrection, and every day there
are more. And each of us carries within ourselves a series of favourite
reasons why we demand change. The spiritual crisis plaguing our mental
environment is one of my prime motivators. We can talk for hours about
whether this reason or that reason is the best. But isn't it
curious-with so many compelling and openly debated reasons for revolt
floating around-that so few revolutions erupt? If everyone is convinced
that political change should happen, why isn't it happening all the
time? The answer is because we don't know how to do it.

The only way to learn the art of revolution is to try, fail and try
again. The dynamics of social change are too fluid for anything less
than relentless innovation and persistence.

Figuring out how to enact change at the government level can be
difficult, if not impossible. Capitalist governments are more and more
paralyzed when it comes to providing social goods. Tax revenue is being
diverted away from caring for citizens and toward servicing sovereign
debt. Austerity is being coupled with a suppression of alternatives
because austerity is profitable to the wealthiest 1 percent of humanity.
And the current political establishment will go to great lengths to
maintain sovereignty by preventing others from reforming the structures
of governance or providing needed social services.

Taking power from the top is increasingly impossible for a people's
movement: to win an election typically requires tremendous wealth and
corporate backing. At the same time, taking power from below with the
typical repertoire of non-violent marches, rallies and petition
campaigns also seems fruitless, given the degree of physical
violence-tear gas, baton charges, sound cannons and more-that the
government now uses to silence our democratic protests. Innovation that
breaks the fundamental paradigms of the protest model is the only way
forward.

Historically, the odds are against revolution. Jack Goldstone, the
sociologist who studies revolutions, calculates the probability of
success to be roughly 4 percent. Our path is strewn with failure.
Revolutions are rare and rarely succeed. Those who feel compelled to
continue on the path know full well that it is far more likely that they
will end up in jail before they see a better world. Maybe they will be
in jail for twenty years, like Nelson Mandela, or two years, like Fidel
Castro, or just overnight, like thousands of Occupiers. Only once we've
overcome our fear of failure, only once we've wagered that revolution is
necessary for the larger part of humanity, whatever the personal cost to
ourselves, will we begin to step forward.

Modern corporatist democracies thrive on the illusion that political
change is possible and that there is a safe way through the labyrinth.
And they have been very successful in influencing most activists to
follow their advice on which way to go be an NGO worker, a social
entrepreneur, a lobbyist. The people are told that what distinguishes
our society from the authoritarians who came before is that political
dissent is protected and encouraged. They say that in our homeland,
government is beholden to the people.

But a whole series of thorny real-world tactical questions remain
unacknowledged and unanswered. What do you do when the government does
not respond to the demands of the people? Once you've gotten as far as
possible with protesting in the streets, only to discover that this
route will not lead you through the labyrinth, in which direction do you
turn?

Our goal as revolutionaries is to foresee the tactics and maneuvers of
insurrection that will flip the status quo on its head. Some say the
social cost of revolution is great enough to dissuade any attempt. They
say the risk of ruin is too high. This counsel should give you reason to
pause, to hesitate before setting off on a path that will profoundly
impact the lives of billions of humans. But social transformations are
as painful as they are necessary. And they are possible only to the
degree that we see both the pain and the necessity of our actions before
acting.

Every action creates its own reaction. In our just-in-time world even
the smallest and most benign disruptions can have tragic outcomes. When
I was a young activist blocking traffic to protest the first day of the
Iraq War in 2003, I grappled with a dilemma: the possibility that an
ambulance might get stuck in the traffic jam. Perhaps a man could be
having a heart attack and be unable to get to the hospital because my
protest has blocked the road. What if he dies? When is the possibility
of unintended harm sufficient to outweigh the necessity of civil
disobedience?

Sincere revolutionaries take seriously the moral and ethical dilemmas
that arise from instigating protest. It is one thing to strike against
an unjust society out of impatient nihilism, wishing only to hurt, and
it is another entirely to rise up collectively in order to heal a global
culture that is terminally ill. Nihilists are present during successful
revolutions, and yet nihilism cannot carry you all the way in your
struggle for justice.

Justice to the activist is a question of how far to go in pursuing a
revolution. Boxing matches have spoken and unspoken rules, and so do
wars between states (the Geneva Convention), spontaneous riots (target
the megacorps; protect the local businesses), terrorism (strike symbolic
targets), violent coups (take out the executive branch, assume military
control of the constitution) and non-violent revolutions (amass in a
central square; demand the resignation of the ruling leader). We choose
the tactics by assessing the historical moment. What is appropriate in
one decade is inappropriate in the next, so it is constant dance with
the limits of political possibility. We improvise while always heading
toward our goal of a new planetary social order, and innovation
increases the likelihood of success.

We keep the goal in sight when we are clear about the ideal we are
heading toward. And some roads, like political terrorism, plainly lead
nowhere. The degeneration of leftist revolutionaries in the 1970s into
urban guerilla cells, in Germany and Italy, for example, was only
possible because those involved succumbed to the negative feelings of
discouragement, nihilism and a loss of hope. When the wildcat strike
that started in Paris May 1968 failed, some activists wrongly saw their
only hope in acts of isolated destruction. Similarly, the horizon of
possibility of nineteenth-century Russian nihilists continually shrank
away from an optimism that they could instigate a broad peasant uprising
and turned into a pessimistic assassination politics. And we witnessed
the same cycle following the failure of the Occupy Gezi protests to
effect change in Turkey that led to the hostage taking, and murder, of a
prosecutor by the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front in March
2015. Terrorism is the last recourse of a shattered political movement.

The people must capture legislative and executive control
constitutionally and legitimately. The greatest problems with political
violence is that it makes attaining legitimate sovereignty almost
impossible.

Legitimacy is a profound concern for our global people's movement. An
essential assumption of horizontalism is that those who disagree with
our movement are still worthwhile, potential partisans; therefore, it is
fatally counterproductive to harm civilians literally or burn bridges
metaphorically.

In states with a strong constitution, the transfer of power from
governments to the people must be carried out in a manner that is
constitutionally legitimate so that one day, when the mainstream is
ready of their own volition, they may join the people without shame.
This objective is the foundation of our just-war theory. It precludes
barbarism, scorched earth policies or collective punishments-the
hallmarks of military regimes. And it is intended from the outset to
avoid civil wars, which are the death knell to people's democracies.

The failure of the Paris Commune in 1871 was due in part to the reuse of
the barricade tactic that was defeated in 1848. But is was also largely
due to the communards' inability to elevate their cause from an
insurrection in a capital city to a legitimate transfer of power from
the government to the people. The Paris Commune was only an echo of the
French Revolution. The events of 1789 were a high-water mark because
revolutionaries succeeded in establishing themselves as the legitimate
power and social guide.

Our movement learned this lesson again during Occupy Wall Street with
the inability of prefigurative anarchism, the notion that activists
could build an ideal society in the Zuccotti Park encampment without
making demands of the existing society, to assume control of the
pre-existing structures of governance. We believed our movement could
attain sovereignty simply by holding consensus-based assemblies in the
public sphere. This assumption proved to be magical thinking. Our
encampments were never recognized as sovereign because Occupiers did not
control the legitimacy-granting structures of society.

Revolution is a two-step process. There is the political revolution: the
toppling of the existing power structures and the ascent of the rebels
to government. And there is the social revolution that follows: the
cultural upheaval whereby the people establish a new social reality.
Power is as much in the culture, the memes and the money that flows
through our social networks as it is in the structures of government.
Capitalism can maintain its supremacy without directly controlling the
reins of government by, to give one example, regulating the flows of
money. Economic sanctions and artificially induced economic depressions
through the control of commodity prices are a form of warfare that can
bring down any nascent revolution. And removing this weapon-the
centrality of money in society-from the armoury of the elites requires
nothing less than a total revaluation of all aspects of life.

There are ethical problems of how to carry out political and social
revolutions. In the first case we are fighting an enemy that is external
to us; and in the second we are fighting an enemy that is internal. To
assimilate without coercion the forces within our body politic that
still in their hearts hold allegiance to the old world is our great
challenge. As the influential twentieth-century philosopher and
political theorist Herbert Marcuse observes, "the aim here is to
transform the will itself, so that people no longer want what they now
want." In Islam, the interior struggle to transform oneself is
considered the greatest struggle. Likewise, the cultural struggle to
awaken the hearts of millions is the most important revolutionary effort
of all.

To be successful, a revolution must overcome the internal inertia of the
people that resists change of any kind. This inertia is experienced on
an individual level as the fear of changing one's routines and of
breaking old habits. On a social level, it is the tremendous peer
pressure that we exert on one another not to act differently, not to
dance too wildly or to leap too far off course. Great civilizations are
held together for centuries by this tendency to follow the path laid
out. And so too are civilizations in decline. The individual and society
at large are conservative and will tend toward continuing the same
general course, even if it is known to lead to ecological collapse and
species death.

In the seventeenth century, innovation was synonymous, literally, with
political revolution, rebellion and insurrection. Thus, Shakespeare has
Henry IV lament the "fickle changelings and poor discontents,/ Which
gape and rub the elbow at the news/ of hurly-burly innovation."
Innovators were revolutionaries who demanded a change in the system.
Four hundred years later, innovation remains an integral part of
revolution.

"Innovation" means "to renew, to make new." For activists, innovation
means to introduce a new way of protesting that breaks the pattern.
Significant social eruptions are often preceded by a tactical innovation
such as the transposition of lockboxes, a tactic developed for defending
forests, to the streets of Seattle. History shows that the weaker
side-the adversary with ten times fewer resources-in asymmetric
conflicts tends to win if they innovate. Innovation in the context of
protest means acting differently from our adversary and our
predecessors. It means adopting tactics that are experimental and
untested. And it also means refusing to mirror or mimic our opponent. As
the military historian Ivan Arreguin-Toft has shown, the weak win wars
when they adopt an approach that differs from their stronger adversary.

Innovation is necessary, but is also difficult, time-consuming and an
inefficient use of energy. It requires committing resources to
experiments that are bound to fail. (Frederick the Great, for example,
experimented for a decade, and tested eight different methods, before
successfully developing the echelon tactic of oblique deployment that
made Prussia victorious in the eighteenth century.) Thus, at the outset
of a social protest both sides have a tendency to eschew innovation in
favour of following the script of whatever worked last time. If
protesters can resist this urge, they will have an advantage. The
stronger actor is overextended and does not have the resources to
respond to each new conflict with its full energy. Instead, the stronger
has a tendency to wait for an event to mature before committing extra
resources. During Occupy, for example, many local police forces did not
have the resources to control the size of the crowds and therefore had
to wait for support from other local agencies before cracking down on
the movement. The stronger side places its faith in the assumption that
they will always be able to bring overwhelming force to bear in the
future, taking this fact as an assurance of long-term success and giving
the weaker the advantage of knowing the likely short-term response of
our adversary. Once rebels have a good intuition for how the status quo
would respond if, for instance, we were to set up an encampment on Wall
Street, we can act on a meta-level by creating ambush situations that
exploit the knee-jerk response of authorities.

Innovation is open-ended. It simply means that we embrace a unification
of the four theories of revolution-voluntarism, structuralism,
subjectivism, and theurgism-to create new forms of protest. We take
freely from any tactic that has ever worked in all of history. Moreover,
we mash up and mutate these tactics in unpredictable ways. Oftentimes
when we innovate, we are looking for tactics that a six-person group of
activists can deploy inexpensively and that other small groups of
protesters can easily replicate. The total cost of launching Occupy Wall
Street was only a few hundred dollars. The resulting impact was
priceless. Innovation allows movements to swerve in new directions. The
point is to always maintain an aura of unpredictability. The adversary
must be forced to treat each new campaign as if it were a nascent event
that could spiral out of control without their overwhelming response.
Innovation by the weak compels the strong into an unsustainable position
of total mobilization and constant readiness.

To be weak and to win requires spirit-the inner force that grants
patience, perseverance and resilience in the face of adversity. As
activists, we launch protests knowing that we will be outnumbered for
several years prior to victory. Defeat in specific engagements does not
break our spirit because of our profound assurance that victory is
inevitable. Our fearless movement is already very resilient on a
collective level. Clearing away Occupy's encampments did not put an end
to our multigenerational revolution. But on an individual level, we can
improve our esprit de corps when mobilized in the streets.

If protesters begin each campaign from an awareness that the nature of
our struggle is such that our adversary is at least ten times stronger,
we will no longer be afraid of being outnumbered. We can instead turn
our creative innovation to questions of how to bounce back and
counterattack. From a strategic perspective, the situation is the same
whether we are high school students who want to publish an underground
newspaper, bottom-up community activists fighting a corrupt mayor or
urban protesters blocking traffic in an effort to end police violence.
The stronger, despite their superior strength, do not always win. The
underdog can, and often does, succeed in power struggles. Having the
largest militarized police force doesn't guarantee that revolutions will
fail, nor does having all the power in the world assure invulnerability
to defeat. There is an ephemeral force that exceeds the material-the
esprit de corps, or the loyal group spirit that gives strength to the
social body-and the side that can harness the people's primal heroism
will often be the victor.

The ancient roman military is an exemplar for studying the decisive
power of spirit over spears. Quite literally, it was the Roman
military's esprit de corps that defeated the most lethal form of warfare
then known to humanity: the Macedonian phalanx of spears that Alexander
the Great had developed to great success. In fact, the Roman legion was
the first in history to withstand a double-thick phalanx assault. The
romans inculcated a heroic spirit with a modular military structure
whose divisions were distinguished by their own history, emblem, rituals
and heroes. New recruits endeavoured to uphold the honour of past
soldiers in their division. The Romans improved on the Spartan warrior
culture that celebrated facing down death rather than fleeing. They
combined this spirit with several tactical innovations such as adopting
the Spanish short sword, which proved gruesomely lethal, and the
maniple, a subdivision of a legion, which, containing fewer soldiers,
benefited an army's deployment and fluid movement. This smaller, more
adept unit gave the Romans an edge over numerically superior adversaries
whose soldiers were trained to prevail through brute, overwhelming force
alone. Spirit conquered spear; the phalanx gave way to the legion, the
legion to a rapidly responsive unit, a model that modern militaries
still emulate.

The dominant paradigm of activism is the voluntarist's ladder of
engagement. In this model, there are a series of rungs leading from the
most insignificant actions to the most revolutionary, and the goal of
organizers is to lead people upward through these escalating rungs. This
strategy appears to make common sense, but has a nasty unintended
consequence. When taken to its logical conclusion, the ladder of
engagement encourages activists to pitch their asks to the lowest rung
on the assumption that the majority will feel more comfortable starting
at the bottom of the protest ladder, with clicking a link or signing a
virtual petition. This is fatal. The majority can sniff out the
difference between an authentic ask that is truly dangerous and might
get their voices heard and an inauthentic ask that is safe and
meaningless. The ladder of engagement is upside down. Activists are
judged by what we ask of people. Thus, we must only ask the people to do
actions that would genuinely improve the world despite the risks.

Rather than pursuing the idea of the ladder of engagement, I live by the
minoritarian principle that the edge leads the pack. This principle
means that when trying to shift the direction of the majority, propose
ideas from the edges of politics. As Starhawk observes, referencing one
of the principles of permaculture farming, "The edge where two systems
meet can be a place of great fertility in nature." Authenticity goes
hand in hand with edginess. The campaign ideas that work are the ones
that put butterflies in our bellies and thrill us into asking, Would I
do that? Would I camp on Wall Street if it meant an end to the financial
stranglehold over our democracies? Would I uproot my family and move to
Nehalem if it meant liberty, equality, community? Would I build a World
Party no matter the cost? The majority does not follow its centre; it
undulates toward its inspirational edges.

Listen to your heart when searching for tactics to transpose. Scour the
edges of politics and adapt the protest behaviours that make you excited
and a bit nervous.

The corollary of this principle is that our political imagination must
be in constant flux as it incorporates emergent tactics. This principle
is minoritarian because it places a greater emphasis on cultivating
tactics that are being developed by political outsiders rather than
privileging the majority. The edge, left or right, is where we find the
best tactics to transpose into our struggle. It is often these edgy
tactical approaches that need to be merely tweaked and applied to a new
context for their potential to take off. In the case of Occupy Wall
Street, for example, all that was needed to transform the occupation
tactic into a social movement was to move occupying out of classrooms
and into financial districts. By reminding ourselves that the edge leads
the pack, we are often able to see the potential of a new tactic before
it has matured.

Activism is at a crossroads. We can stick to the old paradigm, keep
protesting in the same ways and hope for the best. Or we can acknowledge
the crisis, embark on wild experimentation and prepare for revolution.

This book is a call for a spiritual insurrection. The way forward is an
amalgamation of the four theories of revolution-structuralism,
voluntarism, subjectivism and theurgism-with an emphasis on targeting
the mental environment, the collective imagination, in order to achieve
socio-political change. I see weakness in our adversary's reliance on
temporal power. It is time to take the struggle to the immaterial,
spiritual battlefront. A monopoly on the material and physical realms of
life has left the money worshippers overconfident and vulnerable to a
social movement that pulls the people's allegiance out from under the
current world. To win this war, we must split the atom metaphorically
and unleash the greatest creative force: the wild human spirit. While
corporations spread messages of greed or fear or lust, activists of the
future raise our eyes to the higher path. We call for a spiritual
reorientation. We prophesy a people's fellowship of equals guided by
unity, liberty and mutual aid.

In The Rebirth of History: Times of Riots and Uprisings, the philosopher
Alain Badiou unravels the "we are the 99 percent" paradox that has
plagued our movement: how can we be the 99 percent if only a small
fraction of the world's population ever participated in our general
assemblies? The same question will return again and again as the
protests grow and yet ultimately never exceed 50 percent of the
population. So where does our authority come from if we are not the
majority? Rather than increase the number of people in our movement-a
process that destroys our revolutionary impulse-Badiou argues that we
must rid ourselves of the electoral notion that authority "emerges in
the form of a numerical majority." Instead, it is from our ability to
conjure events like the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street-"historical
riots, which are minoritarian but localized, unified and intense"-that
the true "general will," or the collective desires of the people,
emerges. Badiou's argument makes perfect sense when we consider how
minuscule was the number of participants on the first day of the Tahrir
Square Uprising, and yet those people were better expressing the desires
of their entire country than the tens of millions who stayed home.

Many of us already see our people's movement as the manifestation of the
general will. For Badiou, it is now a matter of courageously asserting
that we represent an absolute truth about how the world should, and will
from now on, be governed. Social movements legitimize themselves in the
grand gesture of asserting that we are a "new political possibility."
And we find our strength in, as Badiou puts it, "the authority of truth,
the authority of reason." This explicit connection between impulses to
assert authority and our planetary movement may be surprising, but
Badiou believes an open embrace of people power is secretly what we
desire, if not need. It is "precisely this dictatorial element that
enthuses everyone just like the finally discovered proof of a theorem, a
dazzling work of art or a finally declared amorous passion-all of them
things whose absolute law cannot be defeated by any opinion." The
so-called dictatorial element is the confidence that allows activists to
craft a revolutionary meme and deploy it globally, knowing that we're
unleashing an unpredictable series of events that is worth the risk.

Backed by the people's will, all things are possible. Look historically
and see that amazing transformations have happened in a generation or
two. During the World Wars of the twentieth century, tremendous social
changes (food rationing, conscription, new wartime social rituals)
happened in the span of months. Occupy was launched in weeks. The next
movement may arise in days. Mobilizations on a scale rarely seen in
human history can strike at any moment, if the people are awake.

When my uncle Alfred took me to baseball games in Texas, my favourite
part was the human wave: a social game spectators play when the action
on the field is getting slow. I'd watch it come toward us. People
standing up and sitting down in unison created a powerful visual effect
and feeling of connectedness. I watched with great expectation to see
how many complete circles we could make as a mass. The human wave was
joyful because it required the voluntary participation of anonymous
others. It only took off if the time was ripe the mood was right.

Authoritarians think force is the answer to the problem of how to shift
the destiny of humanity. And they will be able to convince some people
of this. But the coercive path will not lead to global peace. There is
no way to conquer the world physically. It is only possible to unite the
world spiritually. The spiritual insurrection begins internally with a
revealed truth, but it doesn't stop there: the epiphany spreads
contagiously. Violence can be used to divide the world but it cannot be
used to unify the world. No army can hold territory if the people are
hostile. But on the immaterial plane, at the level of ideas and cultural
imagination, civilian activists can make the world's armies put down
their guns, throw their uniforms into the bonfire and welcome the
people's governance with open hearts. By taking the people's war, a
sacred war, to the mental environment, activists of the future do more
than change minds: they will shape how reality manifests.

Not every person you will meet on the journey of revolution will be on
the side of the good or the true. It would be unwise to assume that
everyone who protests is a friend of revolution. State and monied forces
surveil, discredit and infiltrate in the hope of ultimately
extinguishing the flame of collective liberation. The dark side of
protest is an ever-present shadow. Some forces operate explicitly and
wear the insignias of police power. Others work through deception and
mask themselves under false flags, pretending to be on the side of
rebels they are secretly working to undermine. We have seen police go so
far as to marry and have children with activists they are monitoring.
When it comes to revolutionary activism, it can be very difficult to
distinguish light from night, newcomers from entryists-forces that enter
movements to control them from the inside-and friend from front groups.

Social protest movements can adopt either an open or closed membership
model. In open social movements, like Occupy Wall Street, anyone can
join the movement through voluntary self-nomination. To be a participant
in an open social movement is as easy as claiming you are a member. In
closed movements, on the contrary, members are vetted and credentialed
by a central authority. This central authority can be a single leader
or, as in the case of the Five Star Movement in Italy whose
representatives are chosen democratically, reputation can be earned
through the votes of others within the movement.

Open social movements suffer a weakness to the Sybil attack, a method of
undermining peer-to-peer networks that was first identified by computer
scientists. The core difficulty in an open social movement is that if no
one authenticates members, an attacker can fabricate multiple identities
and distort the true makeup of the movement. Imagine a peer-to-peer
computer network that appears to be composed of one hundred distinct
computers but in actuality seventy-five of the nodes are bots under the
control of a single entity, person or organization. Any information that
is transmitted in the social network would likely pass through one or
more of these seventy-five hostile nodes. Perhaps the message will be
intentionally distorted as it passes on. Moreover, the attacker could
broadcast a message from seventy-five seemingly different voices to
overly influence the network. Here is how one team of computer
scientists describe the Sybil attack and its importance: "an attack
against identity in which an individual entity masquerades as multiple
simultaneous identities. The Sybil attack is a fundamental problem in
many systems, and it has so far resisted a universally applicable
solution." The Sybil attack is elegant, simple and yet difficult to
prevent.

Successful revolutions discover methods of distinguishing genuine
members and excluding the false. From the letters of St. Paul, it is
clear that the early Christians faced two kinds of adversaries: the
Romans who persecuted the social movement, and the sectarians who spread
doctrinal dissension among the early adherents. For St. Paul, the latter
adversary, the false participant, was necessary for the truth to be
seen: "I hear that there are divisions among you; and I partly believe
it, for there must be factions among you in order that those who are
genuine among you may be recognized" (1 Corinthians 11:18-19). Front
groups mimic sources of discontent to attract genuine people who
sympathize with movement causes. These individuals are drawn into a
storyline that is remarkably similar to the lineage of revolution, with
one important exception: the actions endorsed are designed to fail.
Protest failure wastes resources-protesters' and organizers' time along
with movement's reputation.

There is reason to believe that some of the activist organizations
operating today are directly funded by secret services, or corporate
forces, in a bid to undermine the wider movement. This claim may seem
surprising; however, evidence exists that front groups have been
deployed by the Central Intelligence Agency in the United States since
the Cold War as a conscious strategy to neutralize revolutionary
impulses. The most well-researched example, the subject of the book
Patriotic Betrayal by Karen M. Paget, is the National Student
Association (NSA), a campus activist organization founded in 1947 and
with chapters on four hundred campuses during its peak in the 1960s. The
NSA was unmasked by as a CIA front group by Ramparts magazine, which in
1967 ran a story declaring, "The CIA has infiltrated and subverted the
world of American student leaders." According to a recent article in the
New Yorker by the Harvard professor Louis Menand, the "CIA embedded
agents in the NSA, and it worked behind the scenes to insure that
pliable students got elected to run the association and that the desired
policy positions got adopted." The fact that the NSA was a front group
was revealed during an unrelated investigation by the U.S. House of
Representatives into philanthropic foundations. Investigators grew
suspicious when they received resistance from the Internal Revenue
Service after asking about the J.M. Kaplan Fund. Menand writes in the
New Yorker that the chair of the committee, Congressman Wright Patman,
accused the CIA of funneling money through the J.M. Kaplan Fund along
with several other foundations both real and invented. As a February
1967 Los Angeles Times report notes, "''The J.M. Kaplan Fund has been
operating as a conduit for channeling CIA funds,' Congressman Patman
announced on August 31, 1964." According to Menand, the CIA 'approached
wealthy people it knew to be sympathetic and asked them to head dummy
foundations\...expenses were paid by the agency...the dummy foundations
were used to channel money to groups the agency wanted to support." A
report from the Congressional Quarterly published on February 24, 1967
reveals that the CIA used at least forty-seven foundations to channel
\$12,422,923 to organizations. Some of the foundations alleged to have
worked with the CIA continue to operate. The J.M. Kaplan Fund, for
example, still exists today with a mission "to champion inventive giving
that supports transformative social, environmental, and cultural
causes." In 2015 the J.M. Kaplan Fund announced it would fund an
"Innovation Prize to support "inter-disciplinary innovation in the
fields of cultural heritage, human rights, the built environment, and
the natural environment.... The Prize is particularly designed for
high-risk, early stage ideas being piloted or prototyped by dynamic
visionaries."

The case of United Against Nuclear Iran, a supposedly non-governmental,
non-partisan, non-profit organization, encourages us to keep our eyes
wide open. In 2014 United Against Nuclear Iran was sued for defamation,
only to have the U.S. department of Justice step in to quash the case,
which was thrown out of court. According to the New York Times, the
government argued that the "case should be dropped because forcing the
group to open its files would jeopardize national security." Based on
this unusual intervention by the U.S. Department of Justice, it is
legitimate to ask, as did Glenn Greenwald, a civil liberties lawyer and
journalist, if the group has links to Israeli and U.S. intelligence
services. We may never know the truth because the defamation case was
not allowed to proceed. Still, it is clear that United Against Nuclear
Iran is operating in the United States to influence domestic policy and
sway public opinion under the guise of being an unaffiliated non-profit
activist organization, and yet the U.S. government argues that opening
its files would reveal state secrets and potentially jeopardize national
security.

More insidious are front groups that purport to be on the side of the
people by mimicking genuine social movements and authentic activist
groups. It can be difficult to tell the fake from the real. And, just as
many student activists within the NSA did not realize they were actually
working for the CIA, it is possible that the activist organization
offering you a campaign job is not who it seems. Front groups may try to
use you as an unwitting pawn to gather information about fellow
activists. One tipoff that you may have been recruited by a front group
is being asked to work on protest movements that target foreign
governments rather than your home country, since front groups function
to divert attention away from domestic revolution. Another indication is
that the group is being operated by a well-funded incubator, a wealthy
parent organization that spins off multiple movements rather than
focusing on a core issue. These incubators often do not disclose the
shared connection with their subsidiary creations or the public. A third
indication is that the leadership of the parent organization lacks a
clear activist lineage or background in protest and yet still has been
placed in high positions (on the boards of well-known environmental
NGOs, for example).

I've been an activist long enough to know that the best way to avoid
front groups is to follow your heart, listen to your intuition and fight
for your community.

Hear, people of the world, I bring glad tidings to you. Tomorrow will be
better than yesterday. Your family will prosper. Songbirds will
serenade. Eagles will soar. Life will flourish. The humblebees will
return and the destitute will be fed. Your neighbor will be your friend.
Your communities will be rich with medicine and universities. Work will
be plentiful, jobs fruitful and art revered. The tyranny of leaders has
ended; the rule of the people has begun. The good times are ahead.

We are the people formerly scattered and divided into distinct creeds,
nationalities and classes. We once fought among ourselves. No longer.
Now our humanity is evolving. We are finding universal common cause and
we are uniting, driven by an unconscious existential necessity, into one
social organism with a will to fight for survival. This is our destiny.

I have addressed this epistle to your heroic self. I pray it reaches
your heart. Each word is an invitation to accept your fate as partisan
in the people's revolution, an ancient spiritual insurrection that is
necessary for the survival of our families, friends and communities.
True democracies-people's democracies-emerge in moments of crisis when
everyday people are required by historical necessity to fend for one
another, self-govern their communities and look after their collective
survival. You are in one of those moments of necessity. Every kind of
person is needed and especially those who have felt like outcasts in the
old world. Rome was founded by vagabonds and wanderers.

You are being called to join us in taking control of the complex world.
We, your brothers and sisters, already operate it. Now a transformation
of values is necessary to gently steer the craft of civilization toward
safer shores. Unity, liberty and mutual aid will be restored to the
pantheon of virtues. We will smash the idolatry of Mammon. Our weapon:
the force of an epiphany that you share, an epiphany that leaps each day
from person to person and people to people. By liberating ourselves from
the fatal assumptions of materialism, consumerism and the suicidal logic
of endless growth, our epiphany holds the key to igniting a period of
sustained creative innovation in all aspects of life. To mitigate the
climate catastrophe, the people will release the wild spirit of humanity
and reshape the world for the good of all beings. This project you must
accomplish before old-world capitalism sinks humanity's mother ship.
This our Great Task and heroes are needed.

Just as some persons can augur tomorrow's weather by look at today's
sky, there are those who have an intuition for the Kairos of spiritual
insurrections, a knack for sniffing out when the people are yearning and
the historical moment is ripe for a mighty heave. You are in one of the
magical moments of revolutionary possibility. And with the right
manoeuvres by a concerned force of everyday people-a people just like
yourself, people who "come as they are" to the struggle-we will kick off
a reorientation in the human spirit. We will change the direction of
civilization for the next millennia and ensure that our children live in
a world that they revere.

I am not promising a utopia. Utopias do not exist, as the etymology of
the word attests. Revolutions, however, do happen and have happened many
times in history. You are in the midst of one right now. Still, you must
know that the old world has left behind a desecrated planet with
structures of global governance in disarray and an economic system in
decay. The first few decades of the coming insurrection are not going to
be easy. But they will be fulfilling-personally, communally and
spiritually. And at the end of each day, you will sleep soundly knowing
that you fought the righteous fight for the future of our species and
the magic of resistance.

The people are rising up. And the people will rise up again and again.
It was your fate to be born during these tumultuous times. Now your
individual existence is destined to be overshadowed by a
multi-generational struggle that stretches back to the dawn of
civilization. At stake is humanity's eternal future. Our people's revolt
has been going on for thousands of years (and in any given century you
can find our protests, petitions and uprisings). Now the tempo of our
insurrection is increasing under the trifecta of capitalism's collapse,
catastrophic climate change and the spiritual crisis of ultramodernity.
We, the people, feel the necessity of social rebirth in our souls and
see it in our families. The potency of our movement is growing. Every
step forward involves the reinvention of protest.

Yours will be revolution through revelation. That was, after all, the
experience of Occupy: a communal spiritual awakening. Without a grand
gesture-a divine miracle-there is no guarantee that there will be a
world for our children. The good demands that you aim at the highest
goal. On the horizon is a diverse and sustained insurrection that
establishes global sovereignty for the people.

In the years ahead, everyday folk will take control of our democracies
one by one and subordinate the pursuit of money to the stewardship of
the newly mundialized world. I shudder at the consequences if the old
world persists any longer. And I see that the people are finally up to
their great task. The ingredients for the people's revolution already
exists. The tactics and new rituals have been unevenly distributed
around the world. The reversal can happen at any moment. For years to
come, the anima mundi, the world soul that connects all beings, will
coalesce in repeated lightning strikes here and there and finally
everywhere at once. Now you need only unleash the greatest creative
force known in history: the collective will to break out of old patterns
and establish a new way of being-a new social order.

The end of protest is the beginning of the spiritual revolution within
ourselves, the political revolution in our communities, the social
revolution on Earth.

We are waiting for you.

A great mission rests on your shoulders. I know you did not choose to be
born under this shadow of a collapsed earth, at a time of unrest. Your
history has selected you all the same. Remember that without our present
faith in your future coming, civilization will slide into the madness of
scorched earth consumerism. I do not know how long we must wait for you.
We shall prepare for you to emerge like lightning.

You are closer than any previous generation of humanity has ever been to
achieving people's democracy. And not just in my country or your country
but in every country. A people's democracy on a planetary scale is
within your reach-that is, if you have the courage, creativity and
tenacity to seize it.

We are finding our courage on a collective species-wide level. Soon the
people will learn to act in a coordinated uprising of seven billion.

Against the backdrop of an increasingly tumultuous world, to be a
partisan is to be on the side of the angry, indebted and hungry. It is
to use any weapon you have at hand-art if are an artist, code if a
hactivist, words if you are a poet or prayer if you are a theurgist-to
turn the tide in favour of those who seek a new world order. Be
opportunistic. Help when you can. "Strike weakness, avoid strength, be
patient." It does not matter if others don't know the work you've done.
Your deeds will live forever in our collective victory.

I have brought a message of peace; I pray it has been heard.

On the surface, where we like to think that faces exist (note the
\"face\" lurking in \"surface\"), this equation of \"identity politics\"
with facets may sound pretty innocuous. And in a sense it is. It
certainly does not sound scandalous enough to compel the question, \"Is
there life after identity politics?\" My point is that before \"identity
politics,\" however we date the emergence of that, there was identity,
and wherever there is identity, there is a struggle over power of some
sort. In our farfetched prehistory, this may have meant my clan against
yours, your tribe against someone else\'s, or their kinfolk against one
another. It may have meant a seemingly simple division of social roles
between menfolk and womenfolk, whereby the pressure of utility\--the
need for divisions of labor\--inexplicably enables one group to assume
priority over the other. 4 The face/t nature of identity\--our tendency
to observe real (in other words, \[End Page 832\] essential) categories
in the surfaces of uniquely materialized faces\--constantly reminds us
that we judge others\' facets by their sur/faces, even when we\'ve never
encountered them in person. This fact (of history, not \"science\")
understandably creates a great deal of frustration and anxiety,
intellectual and otherwise, in the essays of this volume. After all,
centuries of chattel slavery, sexual bondage, ethnic exclusion, colonial
theft, warfare, economic exploitation, internment, apartheid, lynching,
rape, and downright genocide have revolved around fixing faces into
categories based on face/ts of identity. Given that\--thanks to
\"identity politics\"\--we now, most of us, acknowledge these horrific
practices as historical facts, it is easy to forget that the feat of
making them horrible facts of history is a hard-won and fragile victory
based as much in the face/ts of identity as in these genocidal practices
themselves. Given these horrifying facts of history, it is also too easy
to forget to what extent we can and do find pleasure in our group
identifications, even in, or perhaps especially in, those identities
historically burdened by the divisive politics of identity. In other
words, it makes a difference that there was a politics of identity
before the \"identity politics\" that we supposedly are about to lose
forever. At the risk of splitting hairs, I want to suggest that it is
absolutely necessary to distinguish between this longer human history of
the politics of identity and the current episode of \"identity
politics\" at issue among these contributors. If, for a moment, we
accept the notion that \"identity politics\" is a brief episode, a
particular object quickly fading from the sight-lines of amorphous
faces, even if we accept this particular narrative of identity, then we
are stillfaced with (yes that metonymic face again) a politics for
identity before this particular episode of \"identity politics.\" It is
a monstrous mistake to think that the politics of identity is something
that happened only recently and is on the decline just because we have a
name, \"identity politics,\" for a local, putatively short-lived
phenomenon\--a phenomenon that in actuality arises out of a long,
uncharted human history in which \"identity\" has always been the heart
of \"politics,\" if not self-consciously politicized in now familiar
ways. If the politics of identity has been with us since at least the
beginnings of recorded human history, then I must ask again, why the
urge to prophesy the death of \"identity politics\"?

So, each of the contributors to this volume poses a future for or beyond
identity riveted to her or his own identifications and
misidentifications as an author, scholar, teacher, activist, citizen,
family member, lover, and so forth\--as a person, in the most identical
and thus impersonal sense of that word. (We are all persons under the
skin means that we are all the same person after all.) A few of the
contributors I have met in person, as we like to say. I\'m very much
aware of how my physical \[End Page 827\] encounter with them has some
bearing on my sense of who they are as a facet (note the \"face\" in
\"facet\") of what they write. Most of the contributors, though, I have
never met in person. And yet I have a pretty vivid image (a mental
image, not a physical one, no doubt an imaginary one) of what identifies
them with particular agendas, ideas, feelings, institutions, ideologies,
and cultural groups. I don\'t need an actual face, a curriculum vitae, a
biography, a family chronicle, or a genetic map to infer an identity for
those I have never met in person. The face is only one aspect (a word
that means that which we can look at) of a human body, but it is taken
as, if not the key to the soul, at least a locked door through whose
keyhole we can peep to glimpse the messy inner life of an individual as
a specimen of the group identifications that she or he has internalized.
The face, as the front door of the head, has, not surprisingly, been the
most intensely scrutinized body part\--whether by gentle scientists
cautiously manipulating calipers in the ethnological laboratory or by
brutal bigots brandishing guns in the lynching mob. Eyes, nose, ears,
forehead, mouth, lips, eyebrows, nostrils, teeth, tongue, all have been
calibrated and recalibrated with both the most delicate instruments and
the clumsiest weapons of the cartoon, the camera, and the naked eye of
the white supremacist. A single squiggle of the pen\--to narrow the
eyes, broaden the nose, bulge the lips, lower the chin, loll the
tongue\--can sketch a jew, a jap, a nigger, a spick, a native savage the
way a simple shortening of a hemline can turn a chaste lady into a whore
who wants it. We should not overlook the paradox here. On the one hand,
the face provides the fastest take on the unique individuality of a
person\--quicker than any fingerprint or DNA test. On the other hand,
the face is the key index of identity, a word that names similitude as
the foundation and structure of being or striving to become human. Thus,
ironically, the face that marks my singular signature of personhood for
the \"naked\" eye also is supposed to demarcate my identity, my
similitude in relation to self, family, tribe, clan, gender, sexuality,
class, race, region, religion, nation, and ultimately human beingness.
This is why we can so facilely speak of individual identity or unique
identity, an oxymoron that inexplicably binds the uniqueness of
personhood to its sameness within a specifically classifiable group. A
face is a facsimile in the truest sense in that it fabricates similitude
from the fabric of individuality and likewise stamps unique personhood
onto the crowded page of group sameness. To be two-faced is to commit a
sin against not only trustworthiness but also identity, for the single
face ensures that we are true both to the self and to others; it ensures
our kinship to humanity. Just as the face abstracts a full human body
into an aspect readable through collective identity, so actual and
imagined faces (as synecdochies for the body) \[End Page 828\] always
metamorphose into the codeable facets of identity. My face not only is
the barest marker that places me in one race and one gender; it more
subtly becomes a passport that confirms my collective status within the
politics of class, sexuality, regionalism, and nationalism. I may be
born into wealth, but my black face will mark me as a common thief in an
upscale store anywhere in the United States. I may be a French citizen,
but my Algerian face will mark me for the rifled policeman as an
automatic threat to the nation. I may be sexually straight as an arrow,
but bashers convinced of my faggoty nature will be confident that
perverse desire leers in my eyes. Yes, we all now understand that the
self is a canny bricoleur, that the groups that build and inhabit the
self are themselves necessarily hybrid formations; we have committed to
memory the mantras of the socially constructed nature of identity. None
of this matters in the face of a heavy-handed policeman, security guard,
customs officer, or any other corporate state bureaucrat who tags your
face not in the shadows cast by hybridity but in the bright light of his
own\--and his culture\'s\--identity know-how. The more \"hybrid\" he
finds the face to be, the less he is able immediately to classify its
roots with certainty, the more suspect the face becomes, and the more
suspicious the state official has a right to be of the person wearing
the face. At that threshold where hybridity theoretically thrives, in
the borderlands of state authority, is exactly where the hybrid face is
most reduced to a facile code of single identity items: age, height,
weight, sex, birthplace, citizenship and thus alien status. The
\"intersectionality\" of these items, rather than unsettling or
complicating the state\'s take on identity, mainly serves to further
specify and concretize the face within predetermined identity
categories. What is not coded on your passport is coded in your face.
The face reveals the definiteness of your \"race,\" broadly defined as
your tribal identity roots: it promises that you are who you appear to
be in the spittin\' image of the passport photo. The corporate state
(which means that the state has a body, too, whose heads can meet you
face to face) derives its identity authority not so much from its
technologies of legitimation (passports, visas, photography,
fingerprinting, birth certificates, radar surveillance, canine patrols,
loaded artillery of many sorts) as from us. 1 I submit my face to the
camera\'s eye; I submit my face to the eyes of the customs officer. I
agree to be, for however brief a moment, exactly that Black male born in
Cuero, Texas on that date that made me an unknowing and unwilling but no
less complicit subject of the United States of America\'s authority.

Some British romantic poets have suggested that we come to value most
that which we feel is about to be forever lost to us. We cherish a
particular rainbow because we see it once, briefly, as it fades from
view. We cherish the magical notion of a rainbow most at that critical
point in history when physics begins to explain away its magic. In their
deeply insightful essays, Christopher Nealon, Elizabeth Freeman, and
Robyn Wiegman, each in a different way, seek to factor into
gender/sexuality \[End Page 833\] identities the affects and effects of
nostalgia, looking back with envy and/or regret, and progress, looking
forward with cautious or zealous anticipation. I admire the critical
verve of these essays, and would suggest that each does a bit to unpack
the romanticization of the past or the future that sometimes operates in
progressive \"identity politics.\" In the spirit of their efforts
against the grain of romantic thinking, I would suggest that the role
that nostalgia plays in what we value can work contrary to the notions
we find in British romanticism. We can prospectively, as a sort of
self-fulfilling prophecy, create the sense that something must be in a
condition of about-to-be-lost so that its impending disappearance can be
more easily judged a failure, a fad, a diversion, a fait accompli. This
serves to diminish and thus devalue if not the impact of the phenomenon
for the present, at least the chances of its influence into the future.
That lingering effect\--the affect of nostalgia\--is momentary, sure to
vanish with the popularity of the thing itself. Behind the dread of
anticipating a momentous loss can lurk the desire to lose that thing.
Behind the anxiety over the afterwards of \"identity politics\" is a
deeper anxiety fueling a desire to be finished with all identity for
good. And, I would argue, to be finished with identity is to be finished
with politics. Worrying over the death of \"identity politics\" is
really a matter of worrying that identity may have an afterlife after
all\--that is, that the frustrations of identity formation and
articulation may live on even after this particular mode of
multicultural \"identity politics\" is gone. As we all must recognize,
it is hard to make an historical judgment of a phenomenon to which we
are in the midst of being indebted. Various authors in this
volume\--Wiegman, Grant Farred, David Palumbo-Liu, Russ Castronovo, and
Eric Lott\--have composed here forceful critiques of those on the left
who bemoan the detrimental effects of \"identity politics\" as
rigidifying trivial differences, impeding necessary coalitions,
enforcing a crippling political correctness, balkanizing the public
sphere, and distracting us from economics (narrowly defined) as the
structural cause of oppression. 5 If this is so, if our dread is not so
much over the impending death of \"identity politics\" as it is over
identity\'s imminent afterlife, then we have to ask what is feeding this
\"deeper\" anxiety. It would be easy to suggest that some of us are
frustrated with \"identity politics\" because it has failed; thus
because we judge it as having failed, we wish-fulfill its end. As
several of the contributors note, this sentiment can be found on the
political left as well as on the right. Significantly, the \"left\" and
\"right\" political orientation is yet another way in which persons\'
faces are remaindered in impersonal facets, in which people\'s bodies
get personified and then abstracted into the affairs of state as
identity categories, for \"left\" and \"right\" are shorthand for
opposed sides or hands of a political \[End Page 834\] body, which we
dub the \"body politic.\" As the object of critique of most of the
essays in this volume, \"the left\" is an identity formation no less
than race, class, gender, sexuality, or nationality, although it tends
to be overlooked as such. \"No,\" Walter Benn Michaels and Kenneth
Warren might differently exclaim: \"The left\" is shorthand for a
particular cluster of political arguments and agendas, and thus cannot
be equated with those identity formations generated by
biologically-inspired and affectionally-induced categories of race, sex,
sexuality, or caste. As Nealon has nicely theorized, \"affect\" may
operate in much more complicated ways in identity formation than we
usually consider, and, as Priscilla Wald forewarns us in her very
instructive investigation of the identity implications of the new gene
sciences, our \"grammar\" may be so indebted to racialist and racist
habits that any attempt scientifically to separate identity from reason
(whether rationalist science or commonsense reportage or logical
argumentation) is already infected and plagued. For Professor Michaels,
who has a fondness for commonsense rationalism, the notion of what
constitutes a legitimate argument cuts the world bilaterally into either
(1) a substantive difference of opinion (the proper forum of ideology
and the only true procedure for politics), or (2) a mere difference in
perspective (a flimsy and false \"subject position\" articulated in
\"identity politics\" theory). Thus, he further segregates universal
conflicts spawned by disagreements in ideology from the merely local
\"conflicts of interest\" spawned by the \"false consciousness\" (my
phrase) of \"identity politics.\" In his argument, Professor Michaels
skillfully reduces \"identity politics\" to merely a difference in point
of view, as though groups struggling over political power are so many
characters vying for our attention in a realistic novel. It strikes me
that Professor Michaels\'s often stunning argumentation is suffused with
a curious nostalgia and preference for the stark bilateral ideology of
Cold War politics over the rather multilateral pincers movements of
\"identity politics,\" when in fact, as Grant reminds us, the Cold War,
the old Left, New Left, and \"identity politics\" are all messily
overlapped in a political and cultural history that is anything but
simply bilateral. Cultural differences, according to Professor Michaels,
are not ideological differences, because ideology is about the truth
value (the universalizable rightness or wrongness) of a stance, whereas
cultural identity is about \"the politics of survival\": \"Because the
transformation of ideological differences into cultural differences
makes the differences themselves valuable, the politics of a world
divided into cultures (a world where difference is understood as
cultural) must be the politics of survival\--a politics, in other words,
where the worst thing that can happen will be a culture\'s death.\"
Professor Michaels is on to something \[End Page 835\] here, for we do
sometimes talk about groups as though they are endangered species.
There\'s a viciously long tradition of this in regard to the Indian
groups of the Americas\--whereby their nativity as Americans is
constantly confused with and predicates a need to save them from
extinction. Environmentalists sometimes become zealous mimics of what
they think are Native American spiritual practices, allowing their
desire to preserve Native American culture stand in the place of any
participatory struggle along with American Indians for a fair share of
political and economic power. In this disturbing logic, Native Americans
peoples are confused with the wildlife and habitats that
environmentalists seek to preserve from extinction. More recently, we
have heard a lot of talk about saving Black men from extinction.
Nonetheless, Professor Michaels seems to overlook the realities feeding
such language: the actual endangerment of individuals within these
groups because the groups themselves have, in one way or another, been
subject to policies of dispossession, humiliation, and outright genocide
as cultural groups. I don\'t mean this to be hyperbole. Alarm on the
left over disappearing cultural practices is driven largely by concern
for disappeared people, as individuals and as groups, whose lives have
been systematically brutalized in the hope of diminishing their numbers
and thus their ability to put their bodies, synecdochically speaking, on
the line in opposition to various imperialist and racist agendas. By
substituting the idea of the culture for the people who practice the
culture, Professor Michaels makes it seem as though interventions by and
for people experiencing corporate state brutalities are merely actions
to preserve the cultures that they practice, and that come to represent
their presence as a collective identity. More to the point, Professor
Michaels cleverly inverts the operative logic of the \"politics of
survival.\" People do not struggle to survive as a group in order to
possess a culture\--that is, they do not struggle to survive in order to
preserve their cultural identity. To the contrary, they struggle to
preserve their cultural identity as a way of surviving, as individuals,
the acts committed against them as a cultural group. They recognize that
to survive as individuals depends on their ability to cohere, politick,
and speak as a collective body experiencing assault because of their
group identity. That there is greater strength in numbers and greatest
strength in unified numbers is a harsh reality of politics, one not
invented by \"identity politics,\" but understood well by those who have
had to practice \"identity politics\" in order to survive and thus to
increase the odds of garnering a fair share of the country\'s resources.
Moreover, cultural practices often serve as the glue bonding together
disparate individuals in a group, oppressed or otherwise, through an
economy of pleasure in a sort of deliciously kindred know-how. \[End
Page 836\] For racially oppressed groups like American Blacks, for
instance, such cultural practices constitute a means for survival as
well as pleasurable ends whereby the pleasure taken in identificatory
cultural practices cements the bonds enabling survival. Call and
response, shouting, the spiritual, Black preaching, oratory, signifying,
blues, jazz, loud-talk, churchiness, and many other culturally specified
manners help to perform and reproduce a will to struggle together
against the common foe of racism, always under conditions in which
actual solidarity of identity, much less of purpose, is in fact
impossible.

On the one hand, individuals sometimes identify as a group in order to
struggle for a share of power against others with whom they disagree and
to whom they are subordinated. Black women, for instance, vote in a
higher percentage and more consistently than any other identity group
for the Democratic Party. They do not do so in order merely to assert a
different perspective as an identity group; they do so instead because
they understand how their interests, as a collective group, place \[End
Page 837\] them in peril if they do otherwise. Their group identity is
the most effective means for them to take sides in an ongoing argument
in which others constantly attempt to distort and diminish their share
of political, economic, and social resources. If they do not see how
their collective interests pivot on asserting their collective identity,
then they shall not be able to see the argument before them, much less
the ideology operating to buttress that argument. Their collective
identity clarifies which side of the argument they have to be on in
order to have a political voice. On the other hand, sometimes groups
exploit a rational disagreement, creating oversimplified bilateral sides
in order to empower themselves as a group by subordinating others as a
group. Every time politicians attack \"welfare mothers,\" they
manufacture a bilateral argument of us against them, sometimes a very
rationalist one, just to enhance their own political power within the
status quo. The interplay between opinion and identity is neither
either/or nor both/and but all at once. Rational arguments can be used
to mask ideology, and contrarily they can be used to bring it to light,
just as the appeal to identity can be exploited to reveal a true
difference of opinion or exploited to fabricate a rational disagreement
in order to win the upper hand in a competition among groups. Finally,
limiting ideology to a rational disagreement of opinion seems to cover
over the naked reality of what it means to take sides in any argument
not purely defined by rationality, which no argument can be. Such words
as \"side\" and \"stance,\" exploited by Professor Michaels because they
are inescapable in our deliberative discourses, again remind us that
\"left\" and \"right\" are oblique references to the human body, and I
would suggest, as such, they are also references not to just individual
stray bodies, but to collectivities of bodies comprising the body
politic. People take stances\--they take sides\--because they stand
somewhere, and where they always stand in taking a side is in some
identity-formation, assumed or affirmed, normalized or marginalized,
politic or politicized, covered or exposed by the supposed
reasonableness of the side they choose to take. If politics were a forum
among equals, like the relative equality of colleagues at some academic
conference, the attractiveness of Professor Michaels\'s argument would
be undeniable. Politics, however, is a struggle exactly because
inequality exists among individuals constituted as groups. 7 Ideology is
not just the content or substance that thought takes in politics,
defined as the struggle for power; it is moreover the form (including
point of view) and direction (including point of view) that thought
takes as it structures and is structured by politics. Contrary to
Professor Michaels\'s assertions, therefore, point of view is not
extrinsic to an argument; instead it is an intrinsic facet of an
argument as it helps to shape that argument\'s form, direction, and
content. Although it is \[End Page 838\] much more than this, \"identity
politics\" is, to some extent, about what point of view is available to
(and is occupied by) those engaged in a struggle for power, and
about how that power will be exercised. It is a matter not just
of what is being said, but also who is saying it about whom, and
directed toward whose individual and collective benefit and/or
detriment.

From the perspective of a face-down between pro-identity and
anti-identity leftists, it can indeed appear as though \"identity
politics\" ensures the failure of leftist agendas. The phrase
\"political correctness\" has become a talisman of this prediction of
failure. The phrase was coined in the 1970s by lesbian feminists
frustrated with the ideological rigidities expressed by some
lesbian-feminist separatists. It was quickly picked up on the left more
generally, frequently used as a term of affectionate and humorous
critique for those who sought to consolidate the left at the expense of
healthful dissent and to the effect of a banal uniformity. By the late
1980s, political conservatives had successfully expropriated the term as
a way of tarnishing the \"liberal\" agenda with \[End Page 842\] the
illiberal attributes of social and intellectual intolerance. One of the
key successes of the Reaganite movement was exactly this ironic
inversion whereby the label \"liberal\"\--those espousing social,
political, and economic inclusion based in multicultural \"identity
politics\"\--became identified with illiberal values of intolerance,
bigotry, and elitist exclusion, previously targeted as the pet province
of conservatives. I would concede that the right wing has been
astonishingly successful in exploiting against the left the very
differences celebrated as bringing voice to submerged identity groups on
the left. I would rush to add, however, that this tactical right-wing
success is a result of the strategic emerging triumph of \"identity
politics,\" instead of its promised failure. 9 Even while lamenting its
rhetoric and values, and while claiming it as a seductive tribal
mentality that threatens to deform the face of Western civilization,
conservatives in the United States have begun to borrow the practices of
\"identity politics\" to cover over their own internal divisions and to
bolster their ideological agenda. The 2000 Republican Convention, with
its parade of token racial and sexual minorities up to the podium, was
intended to stage inclusiveness as a nationalist value and to reclaim it
as a rightful legacy of the \"party of Lincoln.\" As conservatives
concede the importance of inclusion based in identity, they implicitly
acknowledge how the winnowing of a white numerical majority by the
increasing percentage of racial minorities as a total of the population
threatens the tried-and-true politics\--practiced historically by both
Republicans and Democrats\--of scapegoating Blacks, the poor, and
immigrants to muster an electoral majority of alarmed white voters. It
is no longer enough to be able to cast \"liberals\" as an intolerant
group; conservatives must now seize with their raised left hand the
value of inclusion itself while with the legerdemain of the right hand
behind their back they seek to roll back affirmative action, curtail
public assistance, step up incarceration of the poor, privatize public
resources, infiltrate religion into the state, stigmatize unions,
minimize wages, and generally preserve power, influence, and resources
for the less than two percent of the population who truly rule socially,
politically, and economically. When national right-wing religious
organizations attempted to defeat a local ordinance outlawing sexual
orientation discrimination in Ypsilanti, Michigan, for instance, they
sent in a few conservative African Americans to lead the charge\--allied
with some local Black ministers\--in the mistaken notion that they could
exploit perceived and actual rifts between some white homosexuals and
some African Americans. Seeing through the identity charade, Blacks
voted for the ordinance in overwhelming numbers. Their rejection of the
religious right wing\'s experiment in racial \"identity politics\" does
not mean that they reject \"identity politics\" itself, but instead
indicates that they possess a \[End Page 843\] sophisticated identity
know-how partly fostered by the triumph of a leftist \"identity
politics\" that their own grassroots movements were instrumental in
forging long before academics dreamed up a marketable label for it. In
trumpeting the \"triumph\" of \"identity politics,\" I do not mean that
either the left or the identities associated with it have won their fair
share of the resources, only that we have begun to master a political
discourse of identity that again puts the powerful on alert. As I move
to my conclusion, I want to explore this limited triumph a bit further,
especially as it relates to an economy of pleasure largely unexamined in
identity theory.

[That assembly may be called ["the people]{.mark}" or it may be one
version of "the people"]{.underline}---they do not speak in one voice or
even in one language. But [they [are beings with the capacity to move
with]{.mark} [whatever]{.mark} technical and infrastructural [supports
they require to do so]{.mark}]{.underline} (this is, importantly, an
insight from disability studies that has concrete implications for
thinking through public assembly). And that means that [they can resolve
to stand still, not to move, even to become immoveable in their desires
and their demands.]{.underline} [[The power to move]{.mark} or be still,
to speak and to act, [belongs to the assembly prior to]{.mark}, and in
excess of, [whatever rights a particular government decides to
confer]{.mark} or to protect. The [coming together]{.mark} of a crowd
[has]{.mark}]{.underline}, as John Inazu contends, "[[an expressive
function]{.mark}" prior to any particular claim or utterance it may
make.4 [That]{.mark} very power of [government may]{.mark} well [become
what freedom of assembly opposes]{.mark}]{.underline}, and at that
moment, [we see the operation of a form of [popular sovereignty]{.mark}
that [is distinct from state sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline}, and whose
task it is to distinguish itself from the latter. How, then, do we think
about the freedom of assembly and popular sovereignty? I know that some
people have come to consider "sovereignty" a bad word, one that
associates politics with a singular subject and a form of executive
power with territorial claims. Sometimes it is used as synonymous with
mastery, and other times with subordination. Perhaps it carries other
connotations, though, that we would not want to lose altogether. One
only needs to consider debates about native sovereignty in Canada or
read the important work of J. Kēhaulani Kauanui on the paradoxes of
Hawaiian sovereignty to see [how crucial this notion can be for popular
mobilizations.5 [Sovereignty can be one way of describing]{.mark} acts
of [political self-determination]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is why
[popular [movements]{.mark} of indigenous people struggling for
sovereignty [have become important]{.mark} ways to lay claim to space,
[to move]{.mark} freely, to express one's views, and [to seek]{.mark}
reparation and [justice]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although elections are the
way that government officials are supposed to represent popular
sovereignty (or the "popular will" more specifically), [the meaning of
popular sovereignty has never been fully exhausted by the act of
voting.]{.underline} Of course, voting is essential for any concept of
popular sovereignty, but [the exercise of sovereignty neither begins nor
ends with the act of voting]{.underline}. As democratic theorists have
argued for some time, elections do not fully transfer sovereignty from
the populace to its elected representatives---something of [popular
sovereignty always remains nontransferable,]{.underline} marking the
outside of the electoral process. If not, there would be no popular
means of objecting to corrupt electoral processes. In a sense, [[the
power of the populace remains separate from]{.mark} the power of [those
elected]{.mark}]{.underline}, even after they have elected them, for
only in its separateness can it continue to contest the conditions and
results of elections as well as the actions of elected officials. [If
the sovereignty of the people is fully transferred to, and replaced by,
those whom the majority elect, then what is lost are those powers we
call critical, those actions we call resistance, and that lived
possibility we call revolution]{.underline}. So "popular sovereignty"
certainly translates into electoral power when the people vote, but that
is never a full or adequate translation. Something [of popular
[sovereignty]{.mark} remains untranslatable, nontransferable, and even
unsubstitutable, which is why it [can both elect and dissolve
regimes]{.mark}]{.underline}. As much as popular sovereignty legitimates
parliamentary forms of power[[, it also retains the power to withdraw
its support from those]{.mark} same [forms when they prove to be
illegitimate.]{.mark}]{.underline} If parliamentary forms of power
require popular sovereignty for their very legitimacy, they also surely
fear it, for [there is something about popular sovereignty that runs
counter to, and exceeds or outruns, every parliamentary form that it
institutes and grounds. An \[[A]{.mark}\] elected [regime can be]{.mark}
brought to a halt or [overcome by that assembly of people who speak "in
the name of the people]{.mark}," enacting the very "we" that holds final
legitimating power under conditions of democratic rule]{.underline}. In
other words, the conditions of democratic rule depend finally on an
exercise of popular sovereignty that is never fully contained or
expressed by any particular democratic order, but which is the condition
of its democratic character. This is an extraparliamentary power without
which no parliament can function legitimately, and that threatens every
parliament with dysfunction or even dissolution. We may again want to
call it an "anarchist" interval or a permanent principle of revolution
that resides within democratic orders, one that shows up more or less
both at moments of founding and moments of [[dissolution]{.mark}, but
[is]{.mark} also [operative in the freedom of assembly]{.mark}
itself]{.underline}.

###  3 -- AT: "X Cant Access Protest"?

THESE ACTS OF SELF-MAKING or self-constitution are not the same as
representing a people who are already fully formed. [The term "the
people" does not only represent a preexisting collection of people; if
it did]{.underline}, the term would postdate the production of the
collectivity itself. Indeed, the term can never adequately represent a
collectivity that is in the process of being made or making
itself---both its inadequacy and its self-division are part of its
enacted meaning and promise[. The discursive invocation of the "we"
refers then to a people whose needs, desires, and demands are not yet
fully known, and whose coming together is bound up with a future that is
yet to be lived out]{.underline}. Indeed, [such practices of
self-determination are not quite the same as [acts of
self-representation]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [yet both of these [are at
work in exercising the freedom of assembly in which "we the people" is
spoken or enacted]{.mark} in some way. [That enactment is
performative]{.mark} inasmuch [as it brings into being the people whom
it names]{.mark}, or it calls upon them to gather under the utterance.
And this means that performative actions such as these are part of the
process called political self-determination]{.underline}, designations
of who we are that are also, at the same time, engaged in making that
very "we." Further[, the invocation of ["we" separates popular
sovereignty from state sovereignty]{.mark}; it names and inaugurates
that separation time and again]{.underline}. [[The plurality]{.mark}
always [breaks with those]{.mark} who are elected, or [whose election is
questionable]{.mark} to us, or in relation to a state whose
representatives we have never had the choice to elect]{.underline}, as
is the clear case under occupation and for the undocumented and the
partial or noncitizen. So, [something that must fail as representation,
and that we might call nonrepresentational and nonrepresentative, nearly
tautological, becomes the basis of democratic forms of political
self-determination]{.underline}---popular sovereignty, distinct from
state sovereignty, or, rather, popular sovereignty precisely as it
intermittently distinguishes itself from state sovereignty. [Popular
sovereignty makes sense only in this perpetual act of separating from
state sovereignty]{.underline}; thus[, [it is a way of forming a people
through acts of]{.mark} self-designation and
[self-gathering]{.mark}]{.underline}; [these are repeated enactments
verbal and nonverbal, bodily and virtual, undertaken across different
spatial and temporal zones, and on different kinds of public stages,
virtual realities, and shadow regions]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark}
vocalized [performative, "we the people," is]{.mark} surely [part
of]{.mark} the enactment we are calling
[self-constitution]{.mark}]{.underline}, but this figure cannot be taken
as a literal account of how political self-determination works. Not
every act of political self-determination can be translated into that
verbal utterance---such a move would make the verbal domain more
privileged than any other. In fact, [the enactment of political
self-determination is necessarily a crossing of the linguistic and the
bodily, [even if the action is silent]{.mark} and the body is
sequestered]{.underline}. How do we, for instance, understand the hunger
strike if not precisely as the practiced refusal of a body that cannot
appear in public?10 This means that appearing in public in a bodily form
is not an adequate figure for political self-determination. At the same
time, the hunger strike that is not reported and represented in public
space fails to convey the power of the act itself. [Prisoner networks
are precisely those forms of solidarity that do not, cannot, appear in
public in a bodily form, relying predominantly on digital media reports
with few, if any, images.]{.underline} Those networks of prisoners,
activists, lawyers, and extended kin and social relations, whether in
Turkey, in Palestinian prisons and detention camps, or at Pelican Bay in
California, are also [[forms of "assembly]{.mark}" in which those with
suspended citizenship exercise a form of freedom through strikes,
petitions, and forms of legal and political representation. [Even as
they do not appear]{.mark}, are not allowed to appear, they [are]{.mark}
nevertheless [exercising a certain right to appear]{.mark} in public,
either before the law or [in public space]{.mark}, objecting precisely
to the interdiction against appearing in public that is the condition of
imprisonment]{.underline}. Given all this, let us recapitulate what this
means and does not mean for rethinking the freedom of assembly in
relation to popular sovereignty: (1) [[popular sovereignty]{.mark} is
thus a form of reflexive self-making that is [separate from the]{.mark}
very representative [regime]{.mark} it legitimates]{.underline}; (2) [it
arises in the course of that very separation]{.underline}; (3) [it
cannot legitimate any particular regime without being separate from
it]{.underline}, that is, partially uncontrolled by a regime and not
operationalized as its instrument, and yet it is the basis from which
legitimate government is formed through fair and inclusive elections;
and (4[) its act of self-making is actually a series of spatially
distributed acts, ones that do not always operate in the same way and
for the same purposes.]{.underline} Among the most important of these
spatial distinctions is that between the public sphere and spheres of
forcible confinement, including the prison where political prisoners,
those who have exercised freedom of assembly and freedom of speech, are
contained and subjugated. The passage into and out of the public sphere
is regulated precisely by legal and police power and the institution of
the prison. Further, (5) [the enactment of "we the people" may or may
not take linguistic form; [speech and silence]{.mark}, movement and
immobility, [are all political enactments]{.mark}]{.underline}; the
hunger strike is precisely the inverse of the fed body standing freely
in the public domain and speaking---it marks and resists the deprivation
of that right, and it enacts and exposes the deprivation that prison
populations undergo. The invocation of the people becomes---and must
become---contestable at the very moment that it appears. [["Appearance"
can designate]{.mark} visible [presence]{.mark}, spoken words, but also
networked representation and concerted acts of silence]{.underline}. A
differential form of power that takes both spatial and temporal forms
establishes who may be part of such an enactment and the means and
methods of such enactments. [Confinement implies being spatially
separated from public assemblies]{.underline}, but also involves the
duration of the sentence, or the unknowable duration of indefinite
detention. Since the public sphere is constituted in part through sites
of forcible sequestering, [[the borders that define the public]{.mark}
are also those that [define the confined]{.mark}, the sequestered, the
imprisoned, the expelled, and the disappeared]{.underline}. Whether we
are speaking about the borders of the nation-state where the
undocumented are confined within refugee encampments, where rights of
citizenship are denied or indefinitely suspended, or about prisons where
indefinite detention has become the norm[, the interdiction against
[appearing]{.mark}, moving, and speaking [in public becomes the
precondition of embodied life]{.mark}.]{.underline} The prison is not
exactly the inverse of the public sphere, since prisoner advocacy
networks traverse the walls of the prison[. Forms of prisoner
[resistance are forms of enactment]{.mark} that by definition cannot be
part of the public square, though through networks of communication and
proxy representation, they surely can]{.underline}. And yet, no matter
how virtual we want to think the public sphere (and there are many good
reasons for thinking that), the prison remains the limit case of the
public sphere, marking the power of the state to control who can pass
into the public and who must pass out of it. Thus, the prison is the
limit case of the public sphere, and that freedom of assembly is haunted
by the possibility of imprisonment. One may be imprisoned for what one
says or one may be imprisoned simply for assembling. Or one may be
imprisoned for writing or teaching about assemblies or about freedom
struggles, or for teaching about popular struggles for sovereignty, such
as teaching about the Kurdish freedom movement in Turkish universities.
All of these are reasons why those with the freedom to appear can never
fully or adequately represent the people, since there are people who, we
know, are missing from the public, missing from this public assembled
here in Gezi Park; [they are those who must find representation, even as
those who seek to represent them risk imprisonment for doing
so]{.underline}. And it is not just that there are some people who
happen to be missing from the gathering because they had something else
to do; rather, there are those who could not have gathered in Gezi Park,
or can no longer gather, or who are indefinitely restrained from
gathering. That very power of confinement is a way of defining,
producing, and controlling what will be the public sphere and who will
be admitted to public assembly. It works alongside privatization as a
process that seeks to make public space into the entrepreneurial field
of the market-driven state. So though we may wonder why it is that
crowds that gather to oppose privatization are broken up and dispersed
by police force, gassing and physical assault, we have to remember that
[the state that is off-loading public space to private
enterprise]{.underline}, or that now makes such decisions according to
market values, is involved in at least two ways of controlling and
decimating public space. Some lament that a movement that begins by
opposing privatization inevitably becomes a movement that opposes police
violence. But let us try to see that [[the seizure of public
space]{.mark} from popular sovereignty [is]{.mark} precisely [the aim
of]{.mark} both privatization and police [assaults on]{.mark} freedom of
[assembly]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this way as well, the market and the
prison work together in a prison industry that, as Angela Davis has
clearly shown, works to regulate rights of citizenship---and in the
United States this happens in irrefutably racist ways as black men
continue to constitute the vast majority of prisoners.11 We can add that
the market and the prison work together as well to constrict, decimate,
and appropriate public space, severely qualifying Hannah Arendt's notion
of "the right to appear." That said, I want to return to the theoretical
point about freedom of assembly in order to suggest some of the
political implications of how we think. My inquiry began with the
following questions: In what sense is freedom of assembly a punctual
expression of popular sovereignty? And does it have to be understood as
a performative exercise, or what Jason Frank calls "the small dramas of
self-authorization"?12 I began by suggesting that [[the performative
power of the people does not]{.mark} first [rely on words]{.mark}.
Assembly only makes sense if bodies can and do gather or connect in some
way, and then speech acts that unfold from there articulate something
that is already happening at the level of the plural body]{.underline}.
But let us remember that [vocalization is also a bodily act, as is sign
language, and this means that there is no speaking without the body
signifying something, and sometimes the body signifies something quite
different from what a person actually says]{.underline}.

###  6 -- Aff Method Good

#### It is impossible to live a good life within a bad life -- the act of the performative embodiment of protest by the 1AC calls for new ways of livable life

**Butler 18** (Judith Butler -- Writes comparative literature on gender
theory and is a gender theorist who works at UC Berkeley, Hannah Arendt
Chair at the European Graduate School, Developed the theory on Gender
Performativity, LGBTQ activist -- "Notes Toward A Performative Theory of

And yet, if we return to Adorno's claim that [[it is not possible to
live a good life in a bad life]{.underline}]{.mark}, we see that the
term "life" occurs twice, and this is not simply incidental[. If I ask
how to lead a good life, then I am seeking recourse to a "life" that
would be good whether or not I was the one who might be leading it, and
yet I am the one who needs to know, and so in some sense it is my
life]{.underline}. In other words, already, from within the perspective
of morality, life itself is doubled. By the time I get to the second
part of the sentence, and I seek to know how to live a good life in a
bad life, I am confronted with an idea of life as socially and
economically organized. That social and economic organization of life is
"bad" precisely because it does not provide the conditions for a livable
life, because the livability is unequally distributed. [One might wish
simply to live a good life in the midst of a bad life, finding one's own
way as best as one can and disregarding the broader social and economic
inequalities that are produced through specific organizations of life,
but it is not so simple]{.underline}. After all, [the life I am living
though clearly this life and not some other, is already connected with
broader networks of life]{.underline}, and if it were not connected with
such networks, I could not actually live. So [my own life depends on a
life that is not mine, not just the life of the other]{.underline}, but
a broader social and economic organization of life. So my own living,
[my survival, depends on this broader sense of life]{.underline}, one
that includes organic life, living and sustaining environments, and
social networks that affirm and support interdependency. They constitute
who I am, which means that I cede some part of my distinctively human
life in order to live, in order to be human at all. [Implicit in the
question of how to live a good life in a bad life is the idea that we
might still think about what a good life might be, that we can no longer
think of it exclusively in terms of the good life of the individual. If
there are two such "lives"---my life and the good life, understood as a
social form of life---then [the life of the one is implicated in the
life of the other]{.mark}]{.underline}. And this means that [when we
speak about social lives, we are referring to how the social traverses
the individual, or even establishes the social form of
individuality.]{.underline} At the same time, the individual, no matter
how intensively self-referential, is always referring to itself through
a mediating form, through some media, and its very language for
recognizing itself comes from elsewhere. The social conditions and
mediates this recognition of myself that I undertake. As we know from
Hegel, the "I" who comes to recognize itself, its own life, recognizes
itself always also as another's life. [The reason why the "I" and the
"you" are ambiguous is that they are each bound up in other systems of
interdependency]{.underline}, what Hegel calls Sittlichkeit. And this
means that although I perform that recognition of myself, some set of
social norms is being worked out in the course of that performance that
I author, and whatever is being worked out does not originate with me,
even as I am not thinkable without it. In Adorno's Probleme der
Moralphilosophie, what begins as a moral question about how to pursue
the good life in a bad life culminates in the claim that [[there must be
resistance to the bad life in order to pursue the good
life]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is what he writes: "das Leben selbst
eben so entstellt und verzerrt ist, dass im Grunde kein Mensch in ihm
richtig zu leben, seine eigene menschliche Bestimmung zu realisieren
vermag---ja, ich möchte fast so weit gehen: dass die Welt so
eingerichtet ist, dass selbst noch die einfachste Forderung von
Integrität und Anständigkeit eigentlich fast bei einem jeden Menschen
überhaupt notwendig zu Protest führen muss" \["life itself is so
deformed and distorted that no one is able to live the good life in it
or to fulfil his destiny as a human being. Indeed, I would almost go so
far as to say that, given the way the world is organized, [[even the
simplest demand]{.mark} for integrity and decency [must]{.mark}
necessarily [lead]{.mark} almost [everyone to
protest]{.mark}]{.underline}"\].11 It is interesting that at such a
moment Adorno would claim that he almost (fast) goes so far as to say
what he then says. He is not sure the formulation is quite right, but he
goes ahead anyway. He overrides his hesitation, but keeps it
nevertheless on the page. Can it be so simply said that the pursuit of
the moral life can and must, under contemporary conditions, culminate in
protest? Can resistance be reduced to protest? Or, further, is protest
for Adorno in the social form that the pursuit of the good life now
takes? That same speculative character continues as he remarks that "Das
einzige, was man vielleicht sagen kann, ist, dass das richtige Leben
heute in der Gestalt des Widerstandes gegen die von dem
fortgeschrittensten Bewusstsein durchschauten, kritisch aufgelösten
Formen eines falschen Lebens bestünde" \["The only thing that can
perhaps be said is that the good life today would consist in resistance
to forms of the bad life that have been seen through and critically
dissected by the most progressive minds"\].12 In the German, Adorno
refers to a "false" life, and this is translated into English as "the
bad life"---of course, the difference is quite important, since for
morality, the pursuit of the good life may well be a true life, but the
relation between the two has yet to be explained. Further, it seems that
Adorno appoints himself to the elect group of those who are progressive
and capable enough to conduct the critical activity that must be
pursued. Significantly[, [that]{.mark} practice of [critique is
rendered]{.mark} [synonymous with "resistance"]{.mark} in this
sentence]{.underline}. And yet, as in the sentence above, some doubt
lingers as he makes this set of proclamations. Both protest and
resistance characterize popular struggles, mass actions, and yet in this
sentence, they characterize the critical capacities of a few. Adorno
himself wavers slightly here even as he continues to clarify his
speculative remarks, and he makes a slightly different claim for
reflexivity: "dieser Widerstand gegen das, was die Welt aus uns gemacht
hat, ist nun beileibe nicht bloss ein Unterschied gegen die äussere Welt
... sondern dieser Widerstand müsste sich allerdings in uns selber gegen
all das erweisen, worin wir dazu tendieren, mitzuspielen" \["This
resistance to what the world has made of us does not at all imply merely
an opposition to the external world on the grounds that we would be
fully entitled to resist it.... In addition, we ought also to mobilize
our own powers of resistance in order to resist those parts of us that
are tempted to join in"\].13 What Adorno might be said to rule out at
such moments is the idea of popular resistance, of forms of critique
that take shape as bodies amass on the street to articulate their
opposition to contemporary regimes of power. But also, resistance is
understood as a "no-saying" to the part of the self that wants to go
along with (mitzuspielen) the status quo. It is understood both as a
form of critique that only the elect few can undertake and as a
resistance to a part of the self that seeks to join with what is wrong,
an internal check against complicity. These claims limit the idea of
resistance in ways that I myself would not finally be able to accept.
For me, both claims prompt further questions: What part of the self is
being refused, and what part is being empowered through resistance? If I
refuse that part of myself that is complicit with the bad life, have I
then made myself pure? Have I intervened to change the structure of that
social world from which I withhold myself, or have I isolated myself?
Have I joined with others in a movement of resistance and a struggle for
social transformation? These questions have, of course, been posed to
Adorno's views for some time---I remember a demonstration in Heidelberg
in 1979 when some groups on the left were contesting Adorno, protesting
his limited idea of protest! For me, and perhaps for us today, we might
still query in what way resistance must do more than refuse a way of
life, a position that finally abstracts the moral from the political at
the expense of solidarity, producing the very smart and morally pure
critic as the model of resistance. [If resistance is to enact the very
principles of democracy for which it struggles, then [resistance has to
be plural and]{.mark} it has to be [embodied]{.mark}. [It will]{.mark}
also [entail the gathering of the ungrievable in public space]{.mark},
[marking their existence and their demand for livable lives]{.mark}, the
demand to live a life prior to death, simply put.]{.underline} Indeed,
if resistance is to bring about a new way of life, [[a]{.mark} more
[livable life]{.mark} that [opposes]{.mark} the differential
distribution of [precarity]{.mark}]{.underline}, then acts of resistance
will say no to one way of life at the same time that they say yes to
another. For this purpose[, we must reconsider for our times the
[performative]{.mark} consequences of concerted
[action]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Arendtian sense. Yet in my view,
[the concerted action that [characterizes resistance]{.mark} is
sometimes found in the verbal speech act or the heroic fight, but it is
also found [in those bodily gestures of]{.mark} refusal, silence,
[movement, and refusal]{.mark} to move that characterize those movements
that enact democratic principles of equality and economic principles of
interdependency in the very action by which they call for a new way of
life that is more radically democratic and more substantially
interdependent. A social [movement]{.mark} is itself a social form, and
when a social movement [calls for a new way of]{.mark} life, a form of
[livable life]{.mark}, then it must, at that moment, enact the very
principles it seeks to realize]{.underline}. This means that [when it
works, there is a performative enactment of radical
democracy]{.underline} in such movements that alone can articulate what
it might mean to lead a good life in the sense of a livable life. I have
tried to suggest that [precarity is the condition against which several
new social movements struggle; such movements do not seek to overcome
interdependency or even vulnerability as they struggle against
precarity; rather, they seek to produce the conditions under which
vulnerability and interdependency become livable]{.underline}. This is a
politics in which [[performative action takes]{.mark} bodily and [plural
form]{.mark}]{.underline}, drawing critical attention to the conditions
of bodily survival, persistence, and flourishing within the framework of
radical democracy. If I am to lead a good life, it will be a life lived
with others, [a life that is no life without those others]{.underline};
I will not lose this I that I am; whoever I am will be transformed by my
connections with others, since my dependency on another, and my
dependability, are necessary in order to live and to live well. Our
shared exposure to precarity is but one ground of our potential equality
and our reciprocal obligations to produce together conditions of livable
life. [In avowing the need we have for one another, we avow as well
basic principles that inform the social, democratic conditions of what
we might still call "the good life."]{.underline} These are critical
conditions of democratic life in the sense that they are part of an
ongoing crisis, but also because they belong to a form of thinking and
acting that responds to the urgencies of our time.

###  Debate Bad

#### Debate is bad 

**Hoofd 2007** (Ingrid M. Hoofd, National University of Singapore, "The
Neoliberal Consolidation of Play and Speed: Ethical Issues in Serious
Gaming" in "CRITICAL LITERACY: Theories and Practices Volume 1: 2,
December 2007," p. 6-14, 2007)//robf

[**Serious games are a** fascinating **next stage in the continuous
exploitation of digital media technologies** over the last decades **for
training, learning, and education.**]{.underline} As formal education
and training always involves the transmission and repetition of certain
culturally and socially specific sets of skills and moral values, it
would be of paramount importance to ensure that developments within the
serious gaming industry are in step with the effects of the good
intentions of nurturing people within a social framework that emphasises
a fair, culturally diverse, and blooming society. In this light, it is
interesting that from the very advent of the information society,
digital technologies have been depicted as central to the development of
a more just and equal society by harbouring the promise of bridging gaps
between classes, races, and genders locally as well as globally.
[**Driven by the vision of this utopian potential** of new technologies,
the **education industry and larger policy organisations have been
exploring** the **pedagogical possibilities of these technologies** both
**in- and outside the traditional classroom** for the last twenty-five
years. Indeed, the **implementation of increasingly more sophisticated
and technologically mediated methods and tools for learning and
education, takes as its starting point the techno-utopian assumption
that** (new) **interactive technologies themselves are the primary
harbingers of a fair and blooming society through facilitating (student)
empowerment.**]{.underline} This paper takes issue with this widespread
techno-utopian perspective by seeking to shed light on the larger
ethical implications of serious gaming. It will do so through
foregrounding the relationship between global injustices, and the
aesthetic properties and discourses of serious gaming. So while
reframing serious games themselves in a new ethical perspective
constitutes the main objective of this paper, it is equally important to
situate serious games within a larger political discourse on the
teaching of new skills. Firstly then, [**[policy papers and academic
studies on serious games all display an assumption of]{.mark} the
inherent neutrality of [gaming technologies]{.mark}**, as if these
technologies were mere tools equally suitable for all. **What** also
**becomes apparent** in the language used in these studies and
proposals, **is how [this instrumentalist vision of gaming
technologies]{.mark}** for learning **[goes hand in hand with]{.mark} a
particular [neo-liberal assumption of]{.mark} what constitutes a fit
[individual]{.mark}**, and by extension of **what the hallmarks of [a
'healthy' society may be]{.mark}. For instance,**]{.underline} in the
European Union study "Serious Gaming -- a fundamental building block to
drive the knowledge work society" by Manuel Oliveira on the merits of
serious games for education, justification runs along the lines of
gaming 'encouraging risk-taking and a winning attitude' and creating a
'performance-oriented individual.' Similarly, Michael Guerena from
[**[the]{.mark}** US Orange County **[D]{.mark}epartment [o]{.mark}f
[E]{.mark}ducation [proposes]{.mark}** in one of the Department's
web-casts that **serious games instil** **"twenty-first century skills"
like** risk-taking, **adaptability**, self-direction, **interactive
[communication]{.mark}**, and **'planning and managing for results'** in
the students **[through]{.mark} the "channelling of
[fun]{.mark}."**]{.underline} Likewise, the UK-based Entertainment and
Leisure Software Publishers Association last year published their white
paper Unlimited learning - Computer and video games in the learning
landscape, in which they argue that serious games will "create an
engaged, knowledgeable, critical and enthusiastic citizenry" whose "work
practices will be geared towards networked communication and distributed
collaboration" (49). Concerns around the ethical implications of serious
games regarding their entanglements with larger social (gendered,
classed, and raced) inequalities have until now largely been coined in
terms of game content or representation. In a recent case in Singapore,
the government's proposition of using the RPG Granado Espada in
secondary school history classes was followed by an outcry from various
local academics condemning the stereotypical characters and simplistic
representation of medieval Europe in the game. Likewise, various authors
have critiqued current serious games not only because of simplistic
representation of characters and surroundings, but especially because
simulations generally tend to oversimplify complex social problems and
situations. Gibson, Aldrich, and Prensky's Games and Simulations in
Online Learning (vi - xiv) for instance discuss these demerits of
serious games. While such a critical analysis of how game content
contributes to the reproduction of dominant discourses is definitely
helpful, I would argue that **[the aesthetics of serious games involve
much more than mere content.]{.underline}** Instead, this paper will
argue that [**the formal quest for instantaneity** that **research
around digital media has displayed through** the development of
**interactive** technologies for **[education is]{.mark} already**
itself **[by no means a neutral]{.mark} affair**. This is because **the
discourses that inform [this]{.mark} quest and** that accompany this
**[search for instantaneity arguably enforce the hegemony of a
militaristic, masculinist, humanist]{.mark}**, and of what I will call a
**'speed-elitist' [individual]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Moreover, I
suggest that the propensity of current games to have **[sexist or racist
content, is merely symptomatic of gaming technology's larger problematic
in terms of the aesthetic of instantaneity.]{.underline}** In short,
(**[serious]{.underline}**) computer [**[games have become
archives]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the discursive and actual [violence]{.mark}
carried out in the name of the utopia of technological progress and
instantaneity [under]{.mark} neo-liberal [globalisation]{.mark}. This
archival function is possible** exactly **because cybernetic
technologies promise the containment and control of such** **supposedly
accidental** **violence**, while **in fact exacerbating these forms of
violence**.]{.underline} This leads me to conclude that such violence is
in fact structural to new serious gaming technologies, rather than
accidental. I will elaborate this hypothesis by looking at various
theorists who seek to understand this structural imperative of new
technologies, and their relationship to the neo-liberalisation of
learning and education. In turn, I will look at how this problematic
structural logic informs the two popular serious games Real Lives and
Global Warming Interactive. [Secondly, **the advent of serious gaming**
interestingly **runs parallel with the contemporary dissemination and
virtualisation of traditional learning institutions** into
cyberspace.]{.underline} While the existence of learning tools in other
areas of society besides actual learning institutions has been a fact
since the advent of schools, [**the shift of methods of learning into
online and digital tools is symptomatic** **of the decentralisation of
power from 'old' educational institutions and its usurpation into
instantaneous neo-liberal modes of production**.]{.underline} I am
summarising the work of Bill Readings on the university here, because it
sheds light on the shift in education tout court towards virtualisation,
and its relationship to the 'new hegemony of instantaneity.' [In The
University in Ruins, Readings argues that **the shift from the state-run
university of reason and culture to the present-day global knowledge
enterprise must mean that the centre of power in effect has shifted
elsewhere**. More important, says Readings, is that **the function of
the new 'university of excellence**,' one that successfully **transforms
it into yet another trans-national corporation, [relies on the fantasy
that]{.mark}** [**the university is still**]{.mark} that transcendental
university of culture **in service of the state and its citizens.** So
the **invocation of the fantasy of an 'originary' university of reason
and progress, that produces unbiased knowledge for the good of all,
facilitates the doubling of the production of information into other
spaces outside the university walls proper.**]{.underline} While
Readings surely discusses only higher education institutions in The
University in Ruins, I would argue that the logic of a shifting centre
of power from the state into the technocratic networks and nodes of
speed operates quite similarly in the case of primary, secondary, and
other types of formal education. Indeed, [the current **[virtualisation
of learning]{.mark}** and the emphasis on lifelong learning **[marks a
dispersal of traditional learning institutions]{.mark}** into online
spaces. This dispersal works **increasingly in service of the
'speed-elite' rather than** simply in service of the **nation-state**.
The heralding of **serious games for education can therefore be read as
a symptom of the intensified reach of the imperatives of neo-liberal
globalisation, in which consumption enters** the lives of locally bound
as well as more **mobile cosmopolitan citizens** of all ages through
harping on the technological possibility of the confusion of production
and play. **[Through]{.mark} the imperative of [play]{.mark}** then,
**production** increasingly and diffusely [**colonises all niche times
and -spaces of neo-liberal society**.]{.mark} In other words, (**the
emphasis on**) **play allows not only a potential increase in production
and consumption through the citizen-consumer after** her or his **formal
education of 'skills', but** starkly **intensifies flows of production
and consumption** already **at the very moment of
learning**.]{.underline} While such an integration of play and
production is generally understood within the framework of the
neo-liberal demand for the circulation of pleasure, it is useful here to
widen the scope from understanding the learner as a mere consumer of
pleasure into the larger set of problematic interpellations that marks
subjugation in contemporary society. Intriguingly, a host of research
has emerged over the past years pointing towards the intricate
relationship between subjugation, military research objectives, and
videogame development. Such research suggests an intimate connection
between the C3I logic and humanist militaristic utopias of
transcendence, which incriminates interactive technologies as inherently
favouring culturally particular notions of personhood. In the case of
computer- and video-games for entertainment, researchers have argued
that the aesthetic properties of gaming technologies give rise to
so-called 'militarised masculinity.' In "Designing Militarized
Masculinity," Stephen Kline, Nick DyerWitheford, and Greig de Peuter
argue for instance that [**interactive games open up** very specific
**subject positions that "mobilize fantasies of instrumental
domination"**]{.underline} (255). [**This specific mobilisation** that
video-games invoke, **is not only due to the remediation of violent**
television- and film- **content, but also due to the intimate connection
between gaming- and military industries** which grant these technologies
their particular cybernetic aesthetic properties]{.underline} (see also
Herz 1997). This element of militarisation partly informs my concept of
'speed-elitism.' I extrapolate the idea of 'speed-elitism' largely from
the works of John Armitage on the discursive and technocratic machinery
underlying current neo-liberal capitalism. In "Dromoeconomics: Towards a
Political Economy of Speed," Armitage and Phil Graham suggest that due
to the capitalist need for the production of excess, there is a strong
relationship between the forces of exchange and production, and the
logic of speed. In line with Virilio's argument in Speed and Politics,
they argue that various formerly [**the less connected social areas of
war, communication, entertainment, and trade, are now intimately though
obliquely connected.** This is because **[all these forces mutually
enforce one another through the technological usurpation and control of
spac]{.mark}e** (and territory), and **[through the compression and
regulation of time]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Eventually, Armitage and
Graham suggest that "**[circulation has become an essential process of
capitalism, an end in itself]{.underline}**" (118) [and **therefore any
form of cultural production** increasingly **finds itself tied-up in
this logic**. So **neo-liberal capitalism is a system within which the**
most intimate and **fundamental aspects of human social life** -- **in
particular, forms of [communication and play]{.mark}** -- **get to be
formally [subsumed under capital]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In "Resisting
the Neoliberal Discourse of Technology," Armitage elaborates on this
theme of circulation by pointing out that [**the current mode of
late-capitalism relies on the continuous** extension and **validation of
the infrastructure and** the **neutral** or optimistic **discourses of**
the new **information technologies**. **Discourses that typically get
repeated** -- like in the policy papers -- in favour of the emerging
speed-elite **are those of connection,** **empowerment and progress,**
which often go **hand in hand with** the celebration of **highly
mediated spaces for action and communication**. **Such discourses**
however **suppress the violent colonial** **and patriarchal history of
those technological spaces and** the **subsequent unevenness brought
about by and occurring within these spaces**]{.underline}. I would claim
that Armitage's assessment of accelerated circulation, and the way new
technologies make play complicit in the techno-utopian endeavour of
speed, is crucial for understanding the larger ethical issues
surrounding serious games. It is helpful at this point to look at Paul
Virilio's and Jacques Derrida's work because this helps us understand
the complicity of the aesthetics of interactive and visually oriented
gaming technologies in speed-elitism[. In "Cyberwar, God, and
Television," Paul Virilio talks about **the simulation industry's
function of "exposing \[one\] to the accident in order not to be exposed
to it"**]{.underline} (322). [**What is** according to him
'**accidented' through the virtualisation of accidents and violence**,
for instance in video-games, **is reality itself**. This '**accident of
reality' that virtuality brings about**, argues Virilio**, is due to the
fact that simulation technologies fragment space through** their
property of **instantaneous connection with previously far-away
places**. The hallmark of **this fragmentation** is therefore that it
**brings about an intensification of forms of** in- and **exclusion**
through actual disconnection.]{.underline} Eventually, there will be
"two realities: the actual and the virtual" (323), and I would claim
that [**consequently the privileged speed-elite will be able to live in
the illusion of engaging with social reality** **that the virtual
grants, at the cost of the (s)lower classes who** will **suffer the
social and ecological effects of the accidents of
virtualisation**]{.underline}. The illusion of mastery for Virilio
consists in the sense of the "incorporation of the world within oneself"
that "real time technologies permit" (328) due to their militaristic
compulsion that seeks to "reduce the world to the point where one could
possess it" (329). I maintain that [**these** statements **spell out
exactly the function and logic of serious gaming.**]{.underline} Virilio
elaborates the idea of the 'museum of accidents' later in his infamously
apocalyptic "The Museum of Accidents." His evaluation of certain visual
simulation technologies as 'museums of accidents' and in particular in
how these accidents involve the increasing stratification of individuals
within a new global imperative of speed, resonates well with Jacques
Derrida's work on the 'archiving' properties of new technologies and
their implications. In Monolingualism of the Other, or The Prosthesis of
Origin, Derrida parallels the concept and the technique of memory and
archiving with these new technologies. He argues that [**the tragedy of
the disappearance of various cultures calls forward a desire in** the
R&D community -- like [**teachers and developers of serious games** --
**to prevent this from happening by using**]{.mark} the immense
possibilities of **[presentday archiving technologies]{.mark}**.
However, he cautions that **this scientific quest to rescue through
archiving** **languages and cultures from going extinct due to** ongoing
**globalisation** processes, once more **presupposes** that **cultures
and peoples are pre-given static entities**, or simple identities,
**that can then be simply 'stored'**. Moreover**, it falsely presupposes
that archiving technologies are neutral tools**, as well as that **the
ideology** behind this archiving desire **is a universal or neutral
one**. But **since the very technicity of archiving is one that is
already entangled with the same dominant culture that archives**, the
necessary translation or recognition of materials fit for **archiving
will have as its logical parameters this dominant culture. This** kind
of **messianistic desire, as much as** the quest for understanding the
other (or rather, **the claim that one does empathise with and
understand the other**), **is therefore actually a violent,
neocolonialist, and possessive sort of encapsulation**. Similarly, **the
well-intended pedagogical aim to 'salvage otherness' from the tragedy of
disappearance** under globalisation **works completely in
[accordance]{.mark} [with]{.mark} that very
[tragedy]{.mark}**.]{.underline} One could compare this well-intended
encapsulation for instance with the anthropological display of artefacts
of certain cultures in Western museums. It may be far more important to
save actual humans than to salvage, understand, and store their
perceived culture or language, and Derrida warns that the choice for one
generally does not imply a choice for the other. [**[This 'virtual
empathy']{.mark}** that new simulation technologies endow, which sadly
**[works]{.mark} in accordance with the 'structural accident' of
[disenfranchisement]{.mark}** under neoliberal globalisation, **is
indeed present in the aesthetic of many serious games** currently
available. The widely praised and sympathetic game Real Lives is a good
example of this. **The pedagogical objective** of Real Lives, as its
website declares, **is to "learn how people really live in other
countries." The producers maintain** that **[Real Lives is an
"empathy-building world" which will grant]{.mark}** the students **an
"[appreciation of their own culture and]{.mark}** the cultures of
**[other peoples."]{.mark}**]{.underline} The game opens with assigning
a character who just got born at any place in the world to the player.
Since the attribution of the character is based on actual statistical
possibilities of place of birth and economic status, the character has a
high propensity of being born poor in countries like India, Mexico, or
in other highly populated places. During the course of the game, [**the
player can take actions like deciding to go to school or staying home to
help** her/his **parents**, which **hobbies** to take up, what **job**
to take, **and so forth.**]{.underline} The game time takes one-year
leaps in which [**the player can see the outcome of outside events, like
disease or floods, and** of **his or her own actions**. **The software
shows** a map of the character's birth region and its **statistics, like
population density, gross annual income, currency, health standards**,
and **etcetera**]{.underline}. The character is also assigned traits,
like happiness, athleticism, musicality, health, and so on. While the
player's actions definitely influence the health and economic status of
the played character and her family, the potentially interesting part of
the game lies in the fact that events and situations that are ostensibly
beyond the player's control influence the outcomes. Such a game
structure potentially endows the student with a sense that simple
meritocratic discourses are flawed. [However, what is also obvious in
Real Lives, is that **the attribution based on statistical facts** may
very easily **lead to a simplistic view of a country and its
inhabitants. While** **India** for instance **surely has many poor
people and girls often are not allowed to go to school**, **to have the
student chance time and again on these representations** **can easily
lead to** the repetition of **stereotypes and a failure to grasp the
complexity** of Indian society.]{.underline} [**More serious** however
**is the formal technological mode of objectification and its distancing
effects that the game generates. This objectification resides in** how
**the 'clean' interface**]{.underline} -- the 'flight simulator' like
visual layout on the screen with the overview of categories and
character attributes, the major actions and events in the character's
life induced at the stroke of a few keys -- [in reality **grants the
player a sense of control by engaging** with a machine programmed **in
such a way that it appears to let the student identify with and act
out** his or her **empathy vis-à- vis a 'real' child in need.** This
discursive confusion of reality and virtuality is for instance also
present in the web-game Darfur Is Dying, in which **the player and
virtual character get confused through** the problematic claim that you
can "start **your experience (as a refugee)"** and **that** it **offers
a "glimpse of what it is like"** (emphases mine) **to be a refugee.** At
the same time, **the actual children in need on the ground disappear
from the player's radar, turning** them **into a distant and vague**
large **group of 'others'** who are **effectively beyond the student's
reach of immediate responsibility**.]{.underline} As Virilio suggests,
[**[the time spend through engaging in virtual empathy eclipses the
'real accidents' from the student's view and experience.]{.mark}** What
is more[, **Real Lives eclipses the larger social and economical
relationships between**]{.mark} the **[material production and
consumption]{.mark} of such virtual engagement [and the continuous
exploitation and 'museumising' of peoples on]{.mark} the [brink
of]{.mark}** (social, economical, and environmental)
**[accident]{.mark}, disenfranchisement, and** even **death**. While
**relatively well-off youth** may **indulge in turning other peoples'
distress into a 'fun' educational game,** such indulgence is precisely
**based on a neo-liberal structure that exploits the environment**,
especially of **the poor, and allows for the outsourcing and
feminisation of ever cheaper third-world labour**. As Derrida proposed,
**the archiving into visual technologies of** certain cultures and
**peoples threatened with extinction does not at all imply saving these
actual people and their cultures** -- in fact, **it may very well do
exactly the opposite**. **Long-term minor attitudinal changes** in the
student **notwithstanding**, the disconnecting properties of **the new
cybernetic technologies** of speed that Real Lives is part of therefore
**displace the effect of the producer's and student's good intentions
and empathy into an instantaneous technocratic violence that effectively
'plays with lives.'**]{.underline} Another telling example of this
displacement of well-intended interactive play is the environmental game
[**Global Warming Interactive** -- CO2Fx.]{.underline} This web-based
game, funded by the United States National Science Foundation and
developed by a group of people from various American consultancies and
educational organisations, [aims at teaching the student about the kinds
of decision making involved in global warming.]{.underline} The game
invariably starts with a map of the country of Brazil in the 1960s, and
gives statistics about the carbon emission, air temperature, and general
welfare of the population. [**The player can** then **control government
budget expenditures** for science, agriculture, social services, and
development initiatives, after which the system jumps ten years into the
future, **generating results based on these expenditures**. The game
eventually ends by **showing the relative increase in temperature in the
virtual year of 2060**, **warning** the player that more **international
cooperation is required to really tackle** global **warming**. **The
major issue** with Global Warming Interactive **is once more that it
completely obscures the relationship between the computing technology
itself** that allows the CO2Fx simulation**, and global warming.** A
telling moment of this dissimulation is when **the game urges the player
to "switch off the television!" because television uses quite a bit of
energy, while the energy consumption of the** infrastructure, mode of
production, **student consumption, and tools that sustain the game
itself is** being blissfully **ignored**. Armitage's claim that
increasingly modes of thought, learning, and exchange are formally
subsumed under capital through the new technological infrastructure
certainly rings true here.]{.underline} The game is also a stark
simplification of how government decisions affect a complex issue like
climate change, and is fraught with problematic and often techno-utopian
assumptions about how to tackle the climate change problem. A good
example of this assumption is the recurring recommendation throughout
the game to the player to spend more money on scientific research, as
this expenditure supposedly promises to solve or alleviate the warming
problem. [The **speed-elitist, humanist, and techno-utopian discourses
that permeate American academia** and consultancy firms **are clearly
reflected in Global Warming Interactive, leaving the student inculcated
with a** currently **dominant belief system that lies precisely at the
base of environmental pollution and economical disenfranchisement that
urges certain groups of poor people** in a country like Brazil **to
survive on** environmentally **unfriendly business solutions, like
slash-burning the forests**.]{.underline} One is also left to wonder why
the game uses the country of Brazil in the first place, and not the
United States -- arguably the largest global polluter today. There is
indeed a problematic (neo)colonialist undertone to the current
one-country version of Global Warming Interactive. Extending the content
of the game, as the developers seeks to do, by including more countries
in the simulation, would not alleviate this problem, but would simply
concur with the actual contemporary shift from previous colonialist
social hierarchies into speed-elitist hierarchies. But more seriously,
[**giving the player simulated government omnipotence through** the
Virilian **'museumisation' of the economical and social structures
underlying** global **warming** in that 'other' country of Brazil,
**grants a the player an illusion of mastering and of dealing
constructively with the major 'accident' of climate change and its
impact on the (s)lower classes while actually fuelling it.** Meanwhile,
**player or student empathy is displaced into instantaneous networks
of** ever increasing neo-liberal **circulation and
production**.]{.underline} Scholars like David Leonard in "'Live in your
world, play in ours?': Race, video games, and consuming the other" and
Lisa Nakamura in "Race in/for Cyberspace" have in the past argued that
many entertainment [**games contain elements of racial and gendered
stereotyping allowing the gamer to engage** him or her**self on the
basis of** what Nakamura calls **'identity tourism'** and Leonard calls
'blackface.' **These** problematic **modes of (dis)identification allow
the user not only to enter the game via dominant modes of
representation**, **but** also **entail** a form of '**safely
experiencing the other'** through cybernetic technologies, **where the
(imagined) other** effectively **becomes consumed through the high-tech
prosthesis of the self**.]{.underline} Neither Nakamura nor Leonard
however elaborate how and why this element of a 'safe prosthesis'
appears to be a central aesthetic of gaming technologies. After all,
much media content suffers from stereotypical representation, and one
could argue in line with Derrida's Monolingualism of the Other that
media are always prostheses to the self. I would argue that [**what is
specific about serious gaming technologies** that emerges from my
interpretations of Derrida's, Armitage's, and Virilio's assessments is
the illusion of control by the self that these technologies facilitate,
due to their element of interactive instantaneity. It **is the new
technologies' aesthetic properties themselves** -- **rather than simply
a narrative** and its repetition of dominant ideologies -- **that grant
a 'fantasy of connection, wholeness, and mastery' through
interactivity** as if it was an immediate and transparent property of
the gaming subject.]{.underline} What is therefore at work in serious
games like Real Lives and Global Warming Interactive is a form of double
objectification. [[**The illusion of constructive engagement with a
pressing social issue** through these seemingly 'clean' and 'neutral'
technologies, **combined with the distancing effect brought about by
these technologies from their actual** (**social**]{.mark} and
environmental) **implications**, **make the gamer complicit in** the
neo-liberal endeavour that paradoxically precisely leads to contemporary
**speed-elitist disenfranchisement**.]{.underline} In short, interactive
technologies like serious games bring about a displacement of good
intentions through claims of technological progress and empowerment for
all. So despite (or perhaps because of) the good intentions of game
designers and publishers, these games then in fact exhibit the doubling
of the colonialist logic that inspired humanist narratives of progress.
This doubling runs parallel to the virtualisation of learning that is
taking place under neo-liberal globalisation and its speed-elitist modes
of intensified in- and exclusion this shift incurs. These games can
therefore, in line with Virilio's argument, be understood as attempts at
(eventually unsuccessfully) containing the accident of the real and its
social repercussions brought about by these technologies of speed. [To
conclude, the development of **serious games is implicated in** what
Derrida in Monolingualism refers to as **a 'disappearance' of those
cultures, idioms, and ways of being that do not conform to** these
tightening particular hegemonic structures of **acceleration. 'Healthy'
personhood becomes** singularly **understood through a restrictive** and
stratifying **emphasis on mediated learning as more pleasurable, as well
as** on humanistic character traits like **creativity, activity,
risktaking, mediated empathy, mobility, and competitiveness**, as the
rhetoric in policy papers and optimistic studies also shows. **Such**
particular **valorisations are problematic because they recreate a
meritocratic, masculinist, militaristic, and speed-elitist hierarchy
between** economically as well as otherwise diverse **groups and
communities** within a global community **which understands individuals
solely in terms of active and productive citizenship**.]{.underline} In
line with this, serious games themselves can in their very form be
understood as Virilian 'museums of accident.' [This means that **the
virtualisation of social engagement and sense** of social and
environmental '**accident control'** that **these games call
forward**]{.underline} is obliquely yet intrinsically related to new
modes of 'accidenting' material reality. This potentially
[**disenfranchises those who are not** (positively) **addressed within**
these properties of **[subject-formation, and leads to increasing levels
of stress and competitiveness]{.mark} in** individuals and **students as
it becomes progressively more imperative for individual survival to
conform to the demands of the speed-elite**.]{.underline} Without doubt,
this paper has analysed only a few serious games currently available and
surely more analyses need to be conducted. I suggest nonetheless that
since the problematic of speed, which gives rise to double
objectification, is structurally present in all visual interactive
technologies, it is by default at work in all serious games. As I
suggested at the start, the pedagogical and ethical enterprise of
serious gaming is therefore serious indeed, as its aesthetic properties
become increasingly implicated in precisely the opposite of what serious
gaming promises to help make possible -- the fair, culturally diverse,
and blooming society that we all want.

We might notice as well that the psychological language creeps into the
definition: 'processes, attitudes and behaviour which amount to
discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness
and racist stereotyping'. In a way, the institution becomes recognised
as racist only through being posited as like an individual, as someone
who suffers from prejudice, but who could be treated, so that they would
act better towards racial others. [To say 'we are racist' is here
translated into the statement it seeks to replace, 'I am racist', where
'our racism' is describable as bad practice that can be changed through
learning more tolerant attitudes and behaviour.]{.underline} Indeed, if
the institution becomes like the individual, then one suspects that the
institution also takes the place of individuals: it is the institution
that is the bad person, rather than this person or that person. In other
words, the transformation of the collective into an individual (a
collective without individuals) might [allow individual actors to refuse
responsibility for collective forms of racism.]{.underline} But there is
more to say about how institutional racism becomes an institutional
admission. I am uneasy about what it means for a subject or institution
to posit itself as being racist[. If racism is shaped by actions that
don't get seen by those who are its beneficiaries, what does it mean for
those beneficiaries to see it? We could suppose that the admission
restricts racism to what we can see:]{.underline} after all the
definition also claims that racism 'can be seen or detected' in certain
forms of behaviour. But I would suggest the admission might work both by
claiming to see racism (in what the institution fails to do) and by
maintaining the definition of racism as unseeing[. If racism is defined
as unwitting and collective prejudice, then the claim to be racist by
being able to see racism in this or that form of practice is also a
claim not to be racist in the same way. The paradoxes of admitting to
one's own racism are clear: saying 'we are racist' becomes a claim to
have overcome the conditions (unseen racism) that require the speech act
in the first place. The logic goes: we say, 'we are racist', and insofar
as we can admit to being racist (and racists are unwitting), then we
show that 'we are not racist', or at least that we are not racist in the
same way. To admit to being racist, or as having been racist in the
past, often involves a cultural politics of emotion: we might feel bad
for one's racism, a feeling bad that 'shows' we are doing something
about 'it'. But what does declaring one's bad feeling
do? ]{.underline}We could ask what it means to declare one's shame for
being or having been implicated in racism, which may or may not take the
form of shame about being white. In

 

#### Non-black protest expresses a sentiment of white shame that only reinforces white innocence and pride.

A paradox is clear. [[The shameful white subject expresses shame about
its racism, and in expressing its shame, it 'shows' that it is not
racist: if we are shamed, we mean well. The white subject that is shamed
by whiteness is also a white subject that is proud about its shame. The
very claim to feel bad (about this or that) also involves a
self-perception of 'being good'. Ant-racism may even provide the
conditions for a new discourse of white pride]{.underline}]{.mark}. For
instance, in describing the goal of whiteness studies, Kincheloe and
Steinberg talk about the 'the necessity of creating a positive, proud,
attractive antiracist white identity' (1998: 34). [Here, anti-racism
becomes an attribute of a white subject, which allows that subject to
'turn' back to itself through pride. In the face of such a critique of
the 'terms' of anti-racism, it might even seem worth asking whether
anti-racism is possible.]{.underline} Given that Black politics, in all
its varied forms, has worked to challenge the ongoing 'force' of racism
to even question whether anti-racism is possible seems misguided and
could even be seen as a denial of the historical fact of political
agency. Surely the commitment to being against racism has 'done things'
and continues to 'do things'. What we might remember is that to be
against something is precisely not to be in a position of
transcendence: [to be against something is, after all, to be in an
intimate relation with that which one is against. To be anti 'this' or
anti 'that' only makes sense if 'this' or 'that'
exists.]{.underline} The messy work of 'againstness' might even help
remind us that the work of critique does not mean the transcendence of
the object of our critique; indeed, critique might even be dependent on
non-transcendence.

My concern with the non-performativity of anti-racism has hence been to
examine how sayings are not always doings, or to put it more strongly,
to show how the investment in saying as if saying was doing can actually
extend rather than challenge racism. The claims I describe do not
operate as simple claims.They have a very specific form[[: they define
racism in a particular way, and then they imply 'I am not' or 'we are
not' that. So it is not that such speech acts say 'we are anti-racists'
(and saying makes us so); rather they say 'we are this', whilst racism
is 'that', so in being 'this' we are not 'that', where 'that' would be
racist. So in saying we are racists, then we are not racists, as racists
don't know they are racists; or in expressing shame about racism, then
we are not racists, as racists are shameless, and so on. These
statements function as claims to performativity rather than as
performatives. Or we could even say that anti-racist speech in a racist
world is an 'unhappy performative': the conditions are not in place that
would allow such 'saying' to 'do' what it 'says'.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### The relationship of consent between black people and the state mirrors the master and the slave. The aff's attempt to create some type of understanding between the two preaches white acceptance rather than black resistance.

Generally, the [[representation of the performative has been inscribed
in a repressive· problematic of consensual and voluntarist agency that
reinforces and romanticizes social hierarchy.]{.underline}]{.mark} The
pastoral has been the dominant mode of this problematic of repression.
[[In the social landscape]{.underline}]{.mark} of the pastoral,
[[slavery is depicted as an \"organic
relationship]{.underline}]{.mark}\" so totalizing that neither master
nor slave could express \'the simplest human feelings without reference·
to the other.t, Thus [[the master and the slave are seen as, if not
peacefully coexisting, at the very least enjoying a relation- ship of
paternalistic dependency and reciprocity]{.underline}]{.mark}. In this
instance, [[paternalism minimizes the extremity of domination with
assertions about the mutually recognized humanity of master and
slave.]{.underline}]{.mark} Even the regitne of production becomes
naturalized as \"the rhythms of work,\" as if slave labor were merely
another extension of blacks\' capacity for song and dance. The lure of
the pastoral is in reconciling sentiment with the brute force of the
racial-economic order. [[This repressive problematic of consent
frames]{.mark} everyday practices in terms of Inutual obligation and
[reciprocity between owners and the enslaved]{.mark}. Thus [it stages
the agency of the enslaved as]{.mark} a form of willed
[self-immolation]{.mark} in that what is [consented to is a state of
subjugation]{.mark}]{.underline} of the most extreme order.
Consequently, there presentations of slave agency have intensified [[the
effects of subjugation and dispossession in the guise of will and denied
the abject and ambivalent personhood of the captive in the facile and
spurious attempt to incorporate the slave into the ethereal reahns of
the normative subject through demonstrations of his
consent]{.underline}]{.mark} and! orautonomy, Certainly the notion of
the autonomous self endowed with free will is inadequate and, more
important, inappropriate to thinking through the issue of slave agency.
\'Ihe self-possessed subject with his inalienable attributes is quite
unthink- able or unimaginable in this case. Nevertheless, by emphasizing
complementarity, reciprocity, and shared values, this [[hegemonic or
consensual model of slave relations neutralizes the dilemma of the
object status and pained subject constitution of the enslaved and
obscures the violence of slavery]{.mark}.9 What do reciprocity,
mutuality, and the recognition of the captive\'s humanity mean in the
context of slavery[? In other words, who is protected by such notion

The challenge for NFT is simply this: are we, by publishing this essay,
not entering an internecine battle between whites whose sole aim is to
capture the souls of black folk? From this point of view, [[whichever
side wins, the black stands to lose]{.mark}. In some twisted ways this
is the central point made by this essay - [white help invariably serves
white interests in the final analysis.]{.mark} This may com [miat white
warriors for liberation such as Joe Slovo, Ronnie Kasrils, Judge Albie
Sachs, Jeremy Cronin and Ruth First]{.mark}]{.underline} amongst others.
They all suffered in the fight against white supremacy. Really? Read on.
This essay is essentially about the place, motivation and role of white
people in black struggles. This is a painful and difficult subject which
has plagued all attempts at transforming the anti-black world we
inhabit. Böhmke's conclusion is disturbing in its lucidity - [[white
revolutionaries are essentially missionaries]{.mark}! The journey to
this discovery is long; it eats up all of 185 years! To understand
this]{.underline} conclusion the writer takes us through an inviting
review of a book published in 1834 by a missionary named Stephen Kay
with a long title: ---Travels and Researches in Caffraria, describing
the character, 3 customs and moral condition of the tribes inhabiting
that portion of Southern Africa." Caffraria is real, it's the region of
South Africa we call the Eastern Cape today, the land of the
Xhosa-speaking people and their ---Bushmen" cousins. Böhmke infuses life
into an ancient book that could have been left to rot and never come to
public attention, but it's as if he walked into an amazing piece of
artillery just when he needed it most in the ongoing missionary battles
of our day. He discovered a perfect brick to hurl at the glass edifice
of white radicalism. You can almost hear the shattering glass as it
comes down. Damn! One can imagine how rapidly Böhmke must have turned
the pages of the book as he read, baffled by the shocking discoveries
and startling parallels between the original missionaries in service of
civilisation and today's activist. He must have been floored by the
similarities between contemporary white actors in black affairs who are
separated from their colonial predecessors by almost 200 years. These
brethren in the service of a humanity that dehumanises share the same
impulses, strategies, discourses and concerns. Their overriding
interest, just like Stephen Kay two centuries ago, is to ---urge upon
the Christian world the loud and affecting calls of the perishing
African". The treasure of this discovery couldn't have escaped a
seasoned warrior of Böhmke's calibre. His advantage is that he got there
first; the charge sheet he presents to white radicals indicts him no
less. But he doesn't care to defend himself, he pleads guilty with a
smile. What will the rest of the accused plead? Smart, wicked move

#### The aff does not change the status quo of interactions with black people. White people advocating for black people for what they believe is their "best interest", reaffirms white supremacy by helping black people through the lens of white society, not allwing black people to rebuild and make for themselves.

We discover powerfully how [[today's white activist is no different from
the colonial missionary]{.underline}]{.mark}; they have identical
concerns and designs for the lost soul of the native. Of course unlike
the bible- pushing colonial missionaries today's white activists' time
is expired in service of human rights, justice, participatory democracy
or any other such battle. [[Their bible is
the constitution]{.mark}. From Kay's forays into Caffraria we can see
that when it comes down to it, [both the colonial missionary and the
contemporary human rights counterpart are dealing with the same evils
confronting the blacks]{.mark}: deprivation, homelessness,
lan]{.underline}dlessness, evictions, state repression and
inadequate protection by the law, or more specifically lack of
implementation of existing laws to defend the helpless native[. [The
missionary of yore stood between the Boere hordes and the helpless
natives with his hands to the heavens and the bible under his armpit.
Today the white activist stands between the poor, the squatter, the
landless, the HIV positive and an indifferent black government with the
constitution under the armpit driven by the same impulse to
civilise.]{.mark} ]{.underline}

#### Wypipo trying to help black through the same state and democracy that enslaved them and continues to keep them marginalized crereates this cruel optimism where black people sit and wait and hope for their white saviors to speak up for them. In the end, debaters calling out racists doen't change shit, and we walk out of this round still being a slave

The key point is simply this; the missionary of yesteryear was in it
for colonisation and civilisation through spreading the gospel of God.
Today the white activist is in it to be ---saved from the native". Are
the barbarians still coming? Truth is even those who fought against
apartheid did it to serve and save white civilisation. [[They are
---helpers who destroy". The role of today's white activist is in the
main to channel black anger into the castrating chambers of the
constitutional court]{.mark} where if they lose they must go home and
accept their fate as a turkey would on Christmas Day. [If they win,
and they rarely ever win anything useful, they must party all night long
and be thankful to their white saviours]{.mark} -]{.underline} the
lawyers, researchers and other NGO types in service of human rights and
the constitution. [[This process actually serves to shape the desires of
black people and lowers their expectations of what it means to be
free]{.mark}. Like anima]{.underline}ls they listen as judges and
white lawyers argue about how many kilolitres of water are enough to
keep them clean and quench their thirst; they hear arguments on their
behalf about how many communal toilets can take their shit and the
number of flood lights needed to keep them from smothering each other to
death at night. It doesn't stop there, there are court cases led by
human rights lawyers to determine how the poor must be forcibly removed,
they plead for a just process before the removals but removed the
natives must be, it must just be done according to due process! You'd
think these masses of helpless blacks are not a majority in their own
country. [[Black people have lost all self-respect in the name of the
constitution and democracy.]{.mark} Now both the ANC and the DA are able
to build wa]{.underline}ll-less toilets for blacks!^2 ^

When it comes down to it, [[the white radical is]{.mark} actually [worse
than the colonial missionary]{.mark}. [Without]{.mark} Joe Slovo [it
would have been possible to attempt an entry into a register of black
suffering which didn't defer to whiteness at all]{.mark}. Blacks would

From Fanon Frank Wilderson observes the multiple disadvantages
presented by the presence of a white radical in black struggles. He
writes; ["[White political thought and action is necessarily inadequate
to, and parasitic on, the black body and black liberation]{.mark}".
Referring to the experience of black fighters in the USA and the place
of white radicals in that fight, Wilderson makes the point
that: ]{.underline}

---[[White radicalism works through]{.mark} the same ensemble of
questions, and [the same structure of feeling, as does White
supremacy]{.mark}. [Which is to say]{.mark} that while the men (and
women) in blue, with guns and jailers' keys appear to be
[White supremacy's front line of violence against Blacks, they are
merely its reserves, called upon only when needed to augment White
radicalism's]{.mark} always already a word Kay used often]{.underline}
in his journal is deprivation. Kay was deeply upset by the deprived
condition of the ordinary Xhosa and Hottentot people he encountered (he
is quite scathing about their political leaders, the chiefs, who are
corrupt, sexist and indolent). While deprivation takes the form
of hunger, disease and war once he crosses the Fish River, Kay
encountered a different kind of deprivation among [those [Black people
eking out an existence in the cession lands, or buffer zones just within
the colony and around the white towns. Their deprivation was
homelessness and, barking at the heels, the hounds of
extermination.]{.mark} ]{.underline}

If I were an Adlerian, then, having established the fact that [[my
friend had fulfilled in a dream his wish to become
white]{.underline}]{.mark}---that is, to be a man---I would show him
that his neurosis, his psychic instability, the rupture of his ego arose
out of this governing fi ction, and I would say to him: "M. Mannoni has
very ably described this phenomenon in the Malagasy. Look here: I think
you simply have to resign yourself to remaining in the place that has
been assigned to you." Certainly not! I will not say that at all! I will
tell him, [["The environment, society are responsible for your

itself, and what that is we know. The end of the world. [I wonder

### DA -- Development

**The global liberal political is sustained through more than just arms
sales -- development functions as a civilizing mission that establishes
dependence through loans, trade relationships, diplomacy and direct
foreign investment projects -- the affirmative forces the United States
to shift from an explicitly militarist, colonial intervention to a
developmental approach to Africa.**

Duke University Press, 2003, P 17-22 //tjb\]

**[Although [development]{.mark} has occurred throughout history and
across civilizations, its [formal, self-conscious articulation as a
necessary and self-evident social process is of]{.mark} fairly [recent
elaboration]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as Jorge Larrain, an intellectual
historian of development, suggests, dating back to the rise of the
British bourgeoisie, to classical economists' theories of "progress,"
and to Marx and Engel's theory of the development of social classes and
productive forces (Larrain 1-2). **[The modern elaboration of the
concept of ["development-as-progress"]{.mark} in the late eighteenth
century through the mid-nineteenth, however, [is]{.mark} quite [distinct
from the]{.mark} twentieth-century [concern with the engineered economic
development of entire "peripheral" and "semiperipheral"
areas]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In Larrain's assessment, **[even the
neoclassical and imperialist [theories of capitalist expansion]{.mark},
elaborated during the height of colonial acquisition]{.underline}**
(1860-1945), **[[were fairly indifferent toward the developmental
effects of capitalist penetration on the
periphery]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Instead, these theories focused almost
exclusively on the effects of colonialism on th economies of empire
nations (6-10). However, when theorists of the period turned their
attention to the periphery, it was generally agreed by neoclassical and
anti-imperialist theorists alike---Walras, Jevons, Menger, Marshall, on
the one hand; Bukharin, Luxemburg, Hilferding, Lenin, on the
other---that **[[colonial penetration enhanced capitalist development in
the periphery]{.mark}.]{.underline}**1 **[While genealogically related
to Enlightenment doctrines of imperial reason, development's
contemporary usage as the modernization of national economies dates back
only to the beginning of the twentieth century]{.underline}**. Immanuel
Wallersetin places the origin of the idea of "national development" at
1917, in the "great ideological antimony of the twentieth century,
Wilsonianism vs. Leninism," as both the United States and the Soviet
Union expressed their desire for the liquidation of European empires on
the basis of the right to self-determination of peoples (Wallerstein,
*After Liberalism*, 108-9). Indeed, Wallerstein credits Woodrow Wilson
with universalizing the individual's right to self-determination during
his administration by extending this right to entire colonized "peoples"
in the international arena. Likewise, Lenin saw the condition of
sovereignty as a necessary step for all nations or peoples on the road
toward the creation of a universal world proletariat (110). According to
Wallerstein, **[[this early articulation by competing ideologies of the
right to self-determination]{.mark} with the need for political and
economic integration of the periphery [permanently wed nationalism to
development and,]{.mark} in turn, national development [to anticolonial
struggle]{.mark}.]{.underline}** National Development as the Promise of
a Postcolonial Era The historical record bears this out. Roosevelt's
purported condition for entering World War II on behalf of the Allied
forces was the dismantling of empires following the war. He demanded the
guarantee of equality of peoples and of free trade among them. In his
memoir about his father, *As He Saw It*, Elliot Roosevelt writes that
the president made this demand explicit to Churchill during their
historic meeting in August 1941, which resulted in the Atlantic Charter.
According to his son, President Roosevelt made the postwar abrogation of
special trade agreements between the British empire and its colonies a
condition for US assistance (George and Sabelli 23).2 Roosevelt
attributed the cause of the war to monopolistic colonial relations,
territorial rivalries, and currency devaluations associated with
colonial competition, a position shared by US government officials,
political pundits, and economists of the period. Even before the war was
formally over, the United States spearheaded the implementation of
Roosevelt's conditions by hosting the United Nations Monetary and
Financial Conference. More commonly known as the Bretton Woods
conference after the quiet New Hampshire town that hosted it in July
1944, this conference was a preparatory meeting for the foundation of
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). **[After its mission of
reconstructing Europe was fulfilled, the IBRD became what is today the
World Bank (WB). In the documents produced in preparation for, and in
the aftermath of, the Bretton Woods conference, ["free trade among free
nations" was repeatedly cited as the blueprint for peace and
prosperity]{.mark} in a postwar era.]{.underline}**3 The Bretton Woods
conference sought to create structures that would put this principle
into practice**[. It was the birthplace of modern development as social
engineering on a global scale. [This new commitment to the right of
sovereignty]{.mark} for colonized nations in the periphery [dovetailed
nicely with the economic interests of the United States]{.mark}.
Government officials rightly perceived a looming crisis in US capitalist
expansion, as [the booming war economy would need to find new outlets
for its]{.mark} greatly [expanded productive
capacity]{.mark}]{.underline}** (George and Sabelli 23).
**[[Roosevelt's]{.mark} administration, then, [saw no contradiction
between undertaking the humanitarian mission]{.mark} of assisting in the
development of decolonizing spaces [and expanding the network of trade
for the United States]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In a US Treasury
Department document explaining the Bretton Woods Accord to the public, a
section on the IBRD states simply: The need for developmental loans is
perhaps less urgent \[than loans for reconstruction\], though equally
important from the standpoint of promoting trade expansion. The
underdeveloped countries offer immense stores of raw materials that the
more advanced countries, including the United States, need to supplement
their own exhaustible resources. They also offer the prospect of a
substantial market for manufactured goods. Their first need, however, is
for machinery, tools, and heavy equipment, all of which will have to be
imported and largely paid for with borrowed funds (US Treasury
Department 16)4 **[The point here is not that the United States was
simply or only operating out of the ulterior motive of solidifying its
neocolonial power, for benevolent intentions and self-serving economic
interests are hopelessly intertwined. Rather, my purpose is to
illustrate that, at its inception, [development is inextricably linked
to managing a crisis in capitalist production precipitated equally by
the exhaustion of colonial capitalism's expansive capacities and by
the]{.mark} greatly [expanded productive capacity of the US postwar
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[As a globalizing system, [capitalism
has always relied on supplementary discourses]{.mark} for its
perpetuation and extension. [Development]{.mark}, as it took shape in
the fields of diplomacy and political economy, [under the auspices of
the United Nations, the IMF, the]{.mark} IBRD[/WB, and the US Treasury
Department]{.mark}, began as precisely such a supplementary discourse.
Development [replaced the "civilizing mission" of]{.mark} the age of
[colonialism with]{.mark} the imperatives of [self-determination,
independence, free trade, industrialization, and economic growth in a
postcolonial era. The United States has]{.mark} arguably [been the
primary beneficiary]{.mark} of the invention of development as a
management tool for capitalist production crises.]{.underline}**
However, at Bretton Woods, the US delegation was primarily concerned
with solidifying US economic hegemony by institutionalizing the IMF as
the vehicle for stabilizing currency exchange rates among Western
nations and financing the (relatively) free trade of manufactured goods
and raw materials globally (George and Sabelli 27-29). According to
Susan George and Fabrizio Sabelli, the US delegation had not
contemplated institutionalizing the concept of developing decolonized
economies under the auspices of a world development bank. Thus, when US
treasury secretary Henry Morgenthau accepted the nomination as
conference president, his speech at the first plenary of Bretton Woods
referred only once to the constitution of the future IBRD. After
impugning currency disorder and the lack of free trade as the causes of
war, he talked at length about the formation and functions of the IMF.
Finally, toward the end of his speech, he made some brief comments on
the role of the would-be bank, ending with a dismissive comment: "The
technicians have prepared the outline of a plan for an International
Bank for Postwar Reconstruction which will investigate the opportunities
for loans of this character" (George and Sabelli 28). George and Sabelli
suggest that the US delegation had little interest in expanding the
bank's purpose or longevity beyond the short-term goal of reconstructing
Europe. As the joint authors point out: "The word 'development' in
particular had not been pronounced. 'Postwar Reconstruction' was what
Morgenthau had said and it was what he meant: the reconstruction
certainly of Europe---possibly China and Japan as well, but he was
looking no further... The conference lasted three weeks and for most of
that time, the bank remained the poor relation \[of the IMF\], relegated
to the background" (28). Instead, it was John Maynard Keynes, as
chairman of "Commission II" for the establishment of the bank, who
explicitly introduced the word "development" into the bank's title and
into articles of its constitution. As my chapter epigraph makes clear,
**[Keynes had in mind a much broader vision of the bank's mandate than
the reconstruction of Europe; indeed, he proposed a moral and ethical
"mission" for the bank, requiring the "zeal" of devout purpose and the
universalist horizon of a "faith."]{.underline}** In his initial
discussions of the bank's future role, he implored the members of his
commission to look beyond its initial mandate for the reconstruction of
Europe: "The field of reconstruction from the consequences of war will
mainly occupy the proposed Bank in its early days. But as soon as
possible, and with increasing emphasis as time goes on, there is a
second primary duty laid upon it, namely to develop the resources and
productive capacity of the world, with special attention to the less
developed countries, to raising the standards of life and the conditions
of labour everywhere, to make the resources of the world more fully
available to all mankind" (George and Sabelli 34). Development as a
"primary duty" of this international agency has supplanted what British
imperial theorist J. A. Hobson identified as England's "public duty"
during the great age of empire (Hobson 231). While the British empire is
dwarfed in comparison with the bank's proposed purview ("to make the
resources of the world more fully available to all mankind"), the bank's
purpose is not so far removed from the purpose of British imperial
reason in Hobson's worldview: "It is the great practical business of the
country to explore and develop, by every method which science can
devise, the hidden natural and human resources of the globe" (229**[).
The social Darwinism]{.underline}** invoked by Hobson's humanist
imperialism, however, **[which characterized British colonial subjects
as belonging to the "lower races," has been banished in Keynes's
estimation of the bank's mandate; gone are the references to the
"indolence and torpor of character" of tropical
populations]{.underline}** (Hobson 227). **[[In their stead we have
a]{.mark} nonbiological, evolutionary [sociology of "less developed
countries," and a universalized "productive capacity" of all world
citizens]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Development has also banished
compulsory labor]{.mark} under colonial administrations, [replacing it
with free wage labor and a concern for "raising the standard of life and
the conditions of labour everywhere."]{.mark}]{.underline}** It might be
tempting to think of development as little more than warmed-over
colonialism, given its role in managing a crisis in capitalist
production; or to think of it as a complete break from colonialism,
given its putative claim to deliver on liberal democracy's promise of
liberty and prosperity for all. However, it is important to see
development's *difference from* colonialism, rooted in its action as a
vehicle for facilitating decolonization, and its *links to* colonialism,
rooted in its redeployment of colonialism's logics and structures.
(Indeed, it is quite stunning that suddenly, at least for the moment,
all nations in both the First World and the Third World---those
destroyed by war in Europe and those "hindered" by a lesser development
in decolonized and decolonizing spaces---existed on the equal footing of
"aid recipient," standing within a single "everywhere" in need of
improved conditions of labor and living**[.) [Even as development
emerged]{.mark} in concert with the universal right to national
self-determination, [it]{.mark} nonetheless [carried within it the
traces of imperial reason, of an evolutionary hierarchy and racialized
subordination]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Thus, on one hand, development
reformulates a racialized theory of human perfectibility and progress.
[Even as it dispenses with references to the "lower races"]{.mark} and
genetically determined indolence, [the traces of these categories remain
in its concept of "less developed countries" with impaired productive
capacities]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Perhaps more significant, though,
what lingers almost imperceptibly is the religiously ordained nature of
the civilizing mission.]{.underline}** As the passive construction of
Keynes's phrase "a primary duty is laid upon it" implies, the bank's
duty to develop the world is mandated by a higher principle or power
than mere economic interest, and it requires the fervor of faith to
implement this divine principle. **[[This trace]{.mark} of religious
mission also [inhabits development's liberatory promise to deliver
"mankind" from need]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[On the other hand,
however, [developmentalism]{.mark} far [exceeds]{.mark} the scope of
[colonialism, bringing the entire world under]{.mark} the
[surveillance]{.mark} of a few international agencies]{.underline}**.
Indeed, **[[colonialism is rendered anachronistic by
development]{.mark}. It is precisely [the marriage of development and
decolonization]{.mark} that discursively [legitimates the extraction of
resources and productive capacity]{.mark} in a way the civilizing
mission never could.]{.underline}** **[[The extraction of resources and
productive capacity is]{.mark} ordained as t[he principal course of
action for a decolonized nation to achieve and maintain
sovereignty.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[Even as development articulates
the liberatory promise of delivering decolonized nations from need, it
simultaneously re-creates it by recognizing the "less developed
countries" as being in need of assistance to carry out this dual process
of extraction. In this manner, development aid and agencies insinuate
themselves "everywhere."]{.underline}**

Our ancestors were well aware of the dangers of neocolonialism. During
the 1974 Pan-African Congress, Black leaders from around the world
affirmed the following: To put an end to foreign domination in Africa by
destroying the bases of the last colonial and racist regimes; because
for as long as part of the African continent continues to suffer under
the yoke of foreign domination, irresponsibility and indignity, the
personality and moral integrity of every man, whether or not of African
descent, will be jeopardized. -- From The 9 Point Resolution of the 6th
Pan-African Congress What our ancestors could never have predicted was
the rise of China as a new colonial threat. Thats because Europeans
still maintained substantial control over their former colonies, and
China was in the middle of it's Mao-led Cultural Revolution -- a
genocide that would cost between 3 to 10 Million Chinese lives. But
everything changed with both the death of Mao Zedong in China and the
death of overt colonialism in Africa. These events unleashed the
economic appetites of China on an unguarded source of unlimited wealth:
Africa. HOW THE AGE OF CHINESE COLONIALISM BEGAN After the death of the
founding father of the People's Republic of China, the nation dismantled
many of the oppressive, closed door policies of the Maoist regime. [A
new, economically progressive leader named [Deng Xiaoping]{.mark} came
to power and [placed]{.mark} more [emphasis on modernizing]{.mark}
agriculture, industry, national defense, science and technology than
political ideology. [This ushered in a period of unprecedented economic
growth and investment in foreign nations.]{.mark} In some parts of the
world, investment meant buying up foreign companies. In other parts, it
meant buying the nation itself through government debt. (Currently,
China is the top foreign holder of U.S.Treasury debt.) [But on the
African Continent, China takes a different approach: trade and
aid.]{.mark}]{.underline} HOW CHINA CAME TO DOMINATE AFRICAN TRADE
Today, China is the largest trading partner in Africa -- a surprising
turn of events considering how in the 1960s trade between China and
Africa was almost non-existent. In 1980, the total Sino-African trade
volume was US\$1 billion. In 1999, it was US\$6.5 billion In 2000,
US\$10 billion. By 2005, the total Sino-African trade had reached
US\$39.7 billion before it jumped to US\$55 billion in 2006, making
China the second largest trading partner of Africa after the United
States, which had trade worth US\$91 billion with African nations. The
PRC also passed the traditional African economic partner and former
colonial power France, which had trade worth US\$47 billion. In 2010,
trade between Africa and China was worth US\$114 billion And in 2011,
US\$166.3 billion.During the year 2011, trade between Africa and China
increased a staggering 33% from the previous year to US \$166 billion.
This included Chinese imports from Africa equalling US \$93 billion,
consisting largely of mineral ores, petroleum, and agricultural products
and Chinese exports to Africa totalling \$93 billion, consisting largely
of manufactured goods. In the first 10 months of 2012 it was US\$163.9
billion. Outlining the rapidly expanding trade between the African
continent and China, trade between these two areas of the world
increased further by over 22% year-over-year to US \$80.5 billion during
the first five months of the year 2012. Imports from Africa were up
25.5% to \$49.6 billion during these first five months of 2012 and
exports of Chinese-made products, such as machinery, electrical and
consumer goods and clothing/footwear increased 17.5% to reach \$30.9
billion. As of 2017, Trade between Africa and China has shot up by 19
percent every year. Chinese imports from the African continent almost
doubled by an estimated 46 percent, compared to the same period a year
ago reaching around \$38.4 billion (Source). However, this trade is --
and always has been -- imbalanced. China takes raw materials out of
Africa, turns them into finished goods in China, and brings those
finished goods back to Africa to sell to the masses. This is what they
call trade. This is the same recipe for disaster that Europeans used to
enslave and under-develop Africa early on. AFRICAN AID AND DEBT-TRAP
DIPLOMACY [[China has become not only the largest trading partner in
Africa, but also one of the largest lenders.]{.mark} Across the
Continent, [China is handing out loans for railroads, stadiums, and
roads to countries ignored by the west.]{.mark}]{.underline} In 2014,
China's President Xi Jinping hailed (Then) President Robert Mugabe as a
renowned African liberation leader and an "old friend" of the Chinese
people as the two countries agreed to nine deals whose monetary value
was never revealed. Earlier that year, China finalized a similar
multi-billion dollar railroad deal with the government of South Africa.
Today, formal agreements for plans to build a new railway line in East
Africa with Chinese help have been signed in Kenya that will run from
Mombasa to Nairobi and will extend eventually to Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi
and South Sudan. In Kenya, the line is to replace a narrow-gauge track
built more than 100 years ago during British colonial rule. China is to
finance 90% of the first stage, put at \$3.8bn (£2.3bn), with work
carried out by a Chinese firm, meaning no jobs for Africans. (Source)
Major infrastructure projects like Uganda's Mandela National Stadium, a
\$1.7 billion hydropower dam in western Uganda, and the highway
connecting Entebbe to Kampala have all been built by Chinese companies.
[While African leaders praise China's generosity, [these loans are too
good to be true.]{.mark} The truth is that many of [these loans are not
expected to be profitable for China. When these projects fail to meet
the terms of the loan, China will then be able to control and use those
projects for their own interests outright. This tactic, known as
debt-trap diplomacy]{.mark}, has been used across the world. [Take the
well known example of Sri Lanka:]{.mark} Post-civil war Sri Lanka went
on a borrowing binge to reconstruct dilapidated infrastructure. To
successive Sri Lankan governments, China was a benevolent friend,
offering cheap, easy and addictive money -- an attractive alternative to
the strict conditionality of Western financing arrangements. But the
country soon ran into economic woes, and when the debt burden became
untenable, [the Sri Lankan government was forced to relinquish majority
control over \[Hambantota port\] in 2017 in lieu of repayment]{.mark}.
-- Source [The port was handed over to Beijing on a 99-year
lease]{.mark}, providing China with critical access to Indian Ocean sea
lanes. [China is doing the same thing across Africa.]{.mark} See this
and this.]{.underline} HOW AND WHY CHINA CREATES AFRICAN COLONIES
[Before we can indict China on charges of colonialism or neocolonialism,
it is important for the Pan-African to understand what makes a colony.
If economic power is centred outside of national African boundaries,
then political and military power in any real sense is also centred
outside... -- Walter Rodney Thanks to books like How Europe
Underdeveloped Africa, we know that [the purposes of a colony are: to
extend]{.mark} the [influence]{.mark} of the "mother country" [to
provide]{.mark} a source of [raw materials]{.mark} for the "mother
country" [to provide a market for manufactured products]{.mark} of the
"mother country" [to provide a place for people to live,]{.mark}
especially if the "mother country" is overcrowded China is running out
of natural resources, food, and water. -- Source A study by China's
Ministry of Water Resources found that approximately 55% of China's
50,000 rivers that existed in the 1990s have disappeared. -- Source To
solve these problems, China is looking to its African colonies. Once
reporter who had just returned from the Horn of Africa reported Chinese
agriculture executives running all over the place. [China also appears
to be working to establish bases of operations for future wars.]{.mark}
Just as the Nazis used North Africa to fight the British (and the French
used Africans to fight Germans), [China will likely use its African
territories to fight the west if the two sides come to blows.]{.mark}
And its likely that will be the case. "Glory Drenched In Blood Will Pave
China's Road To Revitalization" --China's President Of The Marine
Institute For Security If such a war were to take place on African soil,
[African's themselves will most likely be drawn into the conflict and be
forced to participate. At the very least, African nations would supply
China with raw materials to fuel their conquest. Angola already pays its
debts to China in oil.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**2. Transcendent subjectivity -- the aff's self-representation as
vanguardist revolutionaries capable of rendering and improving the world
in their image mimics development discourses that seek to differentiate
the prodigal from the prophetic in order to intervene as an agent of
history. This meliorist subjectivity belies an anxiety -- one's
transcendence into revolutionary-ness is never complete.**

In the second chapter of *Guerilla Warfare*, **[[Guevara
instructs]{.mark} prospective [revolutionaries: "We have]{.mark} already
[described the guerrilla fighter as]{.mark} one who shares the
[longing]{.mark} of the people [for liberation and who]{.mark}, once
peaceful means are exhausted, initiates the fight and [converts himself
into an armed vanguard of the fighting people.]{.mark} From the very
beginning of the struggle [he has the intention of destroying an unjust
order]{.mark} and therefore an intention, more or less hidden, [to
replace the old with something new]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (Guevara*,
Guerilla Warfare* 38; italics mine). **[He goes on to describe the
guerrilla combatant [as "an ascetic" with a "rigid self control]{.mark}
that will prevent a single excess, a single slip]{.underline}**" (39);
**[as "striking like a tornado, destroying all, giving no
quarter]{.underline}**" (42); as "audacious...always ready to take an
optimistic attitude toward circumstances" (42-43); **[as [possessing a
"degree of adaptability" and "instantaneous
inventiveness]{.mark}]{.underline}** (43); **[as ["an extraordinary
companion" and physically "indefatigable]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (43);
as entirely self-contained, "carry\[ing\] his house on his back like a
snail" (45). **[In his paradoxical string of adjectives and descriptive
phrases, [Guevara is "utilizing the terminology of]{.mark} Protestant
[personal repression,]{.mark}]{.underline}**" as Ileana Rodriguez has
suggested (*Women, Guerrillas, and Love* 44). Indeed, **[Guevara's
[guerrilla subject bears a]{.mark} compelling tropological [resemblance
to the hero of development discourse]{.mark}: he is [resolute]{.mark},
[destructive and productive, a risk taker, an advantage seeker, flexible
and highly mobile; he is loving, strong, frugal, and
self-determining.]{.mark} Yet the most striking attribute of [this
guerrilla combatant]{.mark} is that he [comes to the people fully
formed]{.mark}]{.underline}**, "as a guiding angel who has fallen into
the zone, helping the poor always" (39**[). In this "how-to" manual on
revolutionary struggle, [there is]{.mark} absolutely [no indication of
how this revolutionary is forged]{.mark}, of how he "converts himself
into an armed vanguard of the fighting people."]{.underline}** Instead,
**[this manual gives us a clear and consistent picture of who the
revolutionary already is, of what he should carry in his knapsack, of
how he should pitch his tent and tend to his weapon]{.underline}**.
**[[This representation of revolutionary subjectivity]{.mark} is
important because it [models]{.mark} most fully [the ideal subject after
a transcendental choice has been made and the revolutionary has left
behind a prerevolutionary order of consciousness]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
However, it stands in dynamic contrast to the representation of
revolutionary transformation in Guevara's diaries.

By now it has begun to dawn that one of the subjects of this class
session is how lawyers translate their moral intuitions and sense of
justice into legal arguments. [Most]{.underline} beginning [students
have found themselves in the situation of wanting to express
their]{.underline} **[moral intuitions]{.underline}** [in the form of
legal arguments]{.underline} [but of feeling powerless to do
so]{.underline}. [A common attitude of]{.underline} Northeastern
[students is that a lawyer]{.underline} **[cannot turn moral and
political convictions into legal arguments]{.underline}** in the context
of case-litigation. [[If you are interested in]{.underline}]{.mark}
directly [[pursuing a moral]{.mark} and/or political
[agenda]{.mark}]{.underline}, at a minimum [[you need to take
up]{.underline}]{.mark} [legislative and [policy
work]{.mark}]{.underline}, and more likely you need to leave the law
altogether and take up grass roots organizing instead. I insist that we
keep the focus on litigation for this class period. After the straw
poll, I ask the students to simulate the role of Staughton Lynd‟s legal
assistants and to assume that the court has just definitively rejected
the claims based on contract, promissory estoppel, and the notion of a
community property right. However, they should also assume,
counter-factually, that Judge Lambros stayed dismissal of the suit for
ten days to give plaintiffs one last opportunity to come up with a
theory. I charge the students with the task of making a convincing
common law argument, supported by respectable legal authority, that the
plaintiffs were entitled to substantial relief. Put another way, I ask
the students to prove that Judge Lambros was mistaken---that he was
legally wrong---when he concluded that there was no basis in existing
law to vindicate the workers‟ and community‟s rights. In some classroom
exercises, I permit students to select the side for which they wish to
argue, but I do not allow that in this session. [All [students are asked
to **simulate the role**]{.mark}]{.underline} of plaintiffs‟ counsel
[and]{.underline} to **[make the best arguments they
can]{.underline}**---**[either because they]{.underline}** actually
**[believe]{.underline}** **[such arguments]{.underline}** **[and/or
[because in their simulated role]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[they are
fulfilling their]{.underline}]{.mark} ethical **[[duty to
provide]{.underline}]{.mark}** zealous
**[[representation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A recurring, instant reflex
is to say: "it‟s simple---the workers‟ human rights were violated in the
Youngstown case." I remind the class that the challenge I set was to
come up with a common law theory. The great appeal of human rights
discourse for today‟s students is that it seems to provide a technical
basis upon which their fervent moral and political commitments appear to
be legally required. "What human rights?" I ask. The usual answers are
(1) "they had a right to be treated like human beings" or (2) "surely
there is some human right on which they can base their case." To the
first argument I respond: "well, how they are entitled to be treated is
exactly what the court is called upon in this case to decide. Counsel
may not use a re-statement of the conclusion you wish the court to reach
as the legal basis supporting that conclusion." To the second response I
reply: "it would be nice if some recognized human right applied, but we
are in the Northern District of Ohio in 1980. Can you cite a pertinent
human rights instrument?" (Answer: "no.") The students then throw other
ideas on the table. Someone always proposes that U.S. Steel‟s actions
toward the community were "unconscionable." I point out that
unconscionability is a defense to contract enforcement whereas the
plaintiffs were seeking to enforce a contract (the alleged promise not
to close the plant if it were rendered profitable). In any case, we have
assumed that the judge has already ruled that there was no contract.
Another suggestion is that plaintiffs go for restitution. A restitution
claim arises when plaintiff gives or entrusts something of value to the
defendant, and the defendant wrongfully refuses to pay for or return it.
But here we are assuming that Judge Lambros has already ruled that the
workers did not endow U.S. Steel with any property or value other than
their labor power for which they were already compensated under the
applicable collective bargaining agreements. If the community provided
U.S. Steel with value in the nature of tax breaks or infrastructure
development, the effect of Judge Lambros‟ ruling on the property claim
is to say that these were not investments by the community but
no-strings-attached gifts given in the hope of attracting or retaining
the company‟s business. At this point I usually give a hint by saying,
"if we‟ve ruled out contract claims, and we‟ve ruled property claims,
what does that leave?" Aha, torts! A student then usually suggests that
U.S. Steel committed the tort of intentional infliction of emotional
distress (IIED).15 I point out that, even if it were successful, this
theory would provide plaintiffs relief only for their emotional
injuries, but not their economic or other losses, and most likely would
not provide a basis for an injunction to keep the plant open. In any
event, IIED is an intentional tort. What, I ask, is the evidence that
U.S. Steel intends the plant shutdown to cause distress? The response
that "they should know that emotional distress will result" is usually
not good enough to make out an intentional tort. An astute student will
point out that in some jurisdictions it is enough to prove that the
defendant acted with reckless disregard for the likelihood that severe
emotional distress would result. I allow that maybe there‟s something to
that, but then shift ground by pointing out that a prima facie
requirement of IIED is that the distress suffered go beyond what an
"ordinary person" may be expected to endure or beyond the bounds of
"civilized behavior."16 Everyone knows that plants close all the time
and that the distress accompanying job-loss is a normal feature of
American life. A student halfheartedly throws out negligent infliction
of emotional distress, to which my reply is: "In what way is U.S.
Steel‟s proposed conduct negligent? The problem we are up against here
is precisely that the corporation is acting as a rational
profit-maximizer." A student always proposes that plaintiffs should
allege that what U.S. Steel did was "against public policy." First of
all, I say, "public policy" is not a cause of action; it is a backdrop
against which conduct or contract terms are assessed. Moreover, what
public policy was violated in this case? The student will respond by
saying "it is against public policy for U.S. Steel to leave the
community devastated." I point out once again that that is the very
conclusion for which we are contending---it is circular argument to
assert a statement of our intended conclusion as the rationale for that
conclusion. This dialogue continues for awhile. [One ineffective theory
after another is put on the table]{.underline}. [Only once or twice in
the decades I have taught this exercise have the students gotten close
to a viable legal theory]{.underline}. **[But this is not wasted
time]{.underline}**---lear[n]{.underline}ing [occurs in]{.underline}
this phase of [the exercise]{.underline}. [The point conveyed
is]{.underline} that [while law and morals/politics are inextricably
intertwined]{.underline}, [they are not the same]{.underline}. For one
thing, [lawyers have a distinct way of talking about and analyzing
problems]{.underline} that is characteristic of the legal culture of a
given time and place. So-called "[legal reasoning]{.underline}" [is
actually a repertoire of **conventional**]{.underline}, **[culturally
approved rhetorical moves and counter-moves]{.underline}** [deployed by
lawyers]{.underline} to [create an appearance of]{.underline} the [legal
necessity]{.underline} of the results for which they contend. In
addition, [good lawyers]{.underline} actually [possess
**useful**]{.underline}, specialized [**knowledge not** generally
**absorbed by** political theorists or movement **activists**. [Legal
training **sensitizes us**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to the many
**complexities** that arise whenever general norms and principles are
implemented in the form of rules]{.underline}]{.mark} of decision [or
case applications]{.underline}. [Lawyers know]{.underline}, for example,
that **[[large stakes may turn on precisely how a right is
defined]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[who has standing]{.underline}** to
vindicate it, **[[what remedies it provides, how the right is
enforced]{.underline}]{.mark}** and in what venue(s), and so on. **[We
are not doing our jobs]{.underline}** properly **[if we
argue,]{.underline}** simply, "**[what the defendant did was unjust and
the plaintiff deserves relief]{.underline}**." No one needs a lawyer to
make the "what the defendant did was unjust" argument. As Lynd‟s account
shows, the workers of Youngstown did make that argument in their own,
eloquent words and through their collective resistance to the
shut-downs. [[If "what the defendant did was unjust" is all we have to
offer, **lawyers bring no added value to the table**]{.mark}**.**
Progressive students]{.underline} sometimes [tell
themselves]{.underline} that [law is]{.underline} basically
**[gobbledygook]{.underline}**, but that you can assist movements for
social change if you learn how to spout the right gobbledygook. In this
view of legal practice, "creativity" consists in identifying an
appropriate technicality that helps your client. But in the Youngstown
situation, we are way past that naïve view. There is no "technicality"
that can win the case. In this setting, [a social justice lawyer must
use the bits and pieces lying around to generate **new legal knowledge**
and **new legal theories**]{.underline}. And [these new theories must
say something]{.underline} [more than]{.underline} "**[my client
deserves to win]{.underline}**" (although it is fine to commence one‟s
research on the basis of that moral intuition). The class is beginning
to get frustrated, and around now someone says "well, what do you
expect? This is capitalism. There‟s no way the workers were going to
win." The "this-is-capitalism" ("TIC") statement sometimes comes from
the right, sometimes from the left, and usually from both ends of the
spectrum but in different ways. The TIC statement precipitates another
teachable moment. I begin by saying that we need to tease out exactly
what the student means by TIC, as several interpretations are possible.
For example, TIC might be a prediction of what contemporary courts are
most likely to do. That is, TIC might be equivalent to saying that "it
doesn‟t matter what theory you come up with; 999 US judges out of 1,000
would rule for U. S. Steel."17 I allow that this is probably true, but
not very revealing. The workers knew what the odds were before they
launched the case. **[Even if doomed to fail]{.underline}**, [[a legal
case **may still make a contribution to social
justice**]{.underline}]{.mark} if [the litigation creates a]{.underline}
**[focal point of energy around which a community can mobilize,
articulate moral and political claims, educate the wider public, and
conduct political consciousness-raising]{.underline}**. And if there is
political value in pursuing a case, we might as well make good legal
arguments. On an alternative reading, the TIC observation is more
ambitious than a mere prediction. It might be a claim that a capitalist
society requires a legal structure of a certain kind, and that therefore
professionally acceptable legal reasoning within capitalist legal
regimes cannot produce a theory that interrogates the status quo beyond
a certain point. Put another way, some outcomes are so foreign to the
bedrock assumptions of private ownership that they cannot be reached by
respectable legal reasoning. A good example of an outcome that is
incompatible with capitalism, so the argument goes, is a court order
interfering with U.S. Steel‟s decision to leave Youngstown. [This
reading of the TIC comment embodies]{.underline} [the idea]{.underline}
that [legal discourse]{.underline} is [encased within a
deeper]{.underline}, extra-legal [structure given by requirements
of]{.underline} the social order ([capitalism]{.underline}), [so that
within professionally responsible legal argument]{.underline} [the best
lawyers in the world could not state a winning theory]{.underline} in
Local 1330. Ironically, **[the left and the right in the class often
share this belief.]{.underline}** I take both conservative and
progressive students on about this. I insist that [[the]{.underline}
[claim]{.underline} that [our law is constrained by a]{.underline}
[**rigid** meta-logic]{.underline}]{.mark} [of
capitalism]{.underline}---which curiously parallels the notion that
legal outcomes are tightly constrained by legal
reasoning---**[[is]{.mark} just plain [wrong]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[Capitalist societies recognize]{.underline} all **[sorts of
limitations]{.underline}** [on the rights of property
owners]{.underline}. Professor Singer‟s classic article catalogues a
multitude of them.18 [The claim is **not only false**]{.underline},
**[it is a dangerous falsehood]{.underline}**. **[To believe TIC in this
sense is to limit in advance our aspirations for what social justice
lawyering can accomplish]{.underline}**. Now the class begins to sense
that I am not just playing law professor and asking rhetorical questions
to which there are no answers. The students realize that I actually
think that I have a theory up my sleeve that shows that Judge Lambros
was wrong on the law. If things are going well, the students begin to
feel an emotional stake in the exercise. Many who voted in the straw
poll that the plaintiffs deserved to win are anxious to see whether I
can pull it off. Other students probably engage emotionally for a
different reason---the ones who have been skeptical or derisive of my
approach all term hope that my "theory," when I eventually reveal it, is
so implausible that I will fall flat on my face. I begin to feed the
students more hints. One year I gave the hint, "What do straying
livestock, leaking reservoirs, dynamite blasting, and unsafe products
have in common?"---but that made it too easy. Usually my hints are more
oblique, as in "does anything you learned about accident law ring a
bell?" Whatever the form, the students take the hints, and some start
cooking with gas. Over the next few minutes, the pieces usually fall
into place. The legal theory toward which I have been steering the
students is that U.S. Steel is strictly liable in tort for the negative
social effects of its decision to disinvest in Youngstown. I contend
that that is what the law provided in Ohio in 1980, and therefore a
mechanism was available for the District Court to order substantial
relief. A basic, albeit contested theme of modern tort law, which all
students learn in first year, is that society allows numerous risky and
predictably harmful activities to proceed because we deem those
activities, on balance, to be worthwhile or necessary. In such cases,
the law often imposes liability rules designed to make the activity pay
for the injuries or accidents it inevitably causes. For more than a
century, tort rules have been fashioned to force actors to take account
of all consequences proximately attributable to their actions, so that
they will internalize the relevant costs and price their products
accordingly. The expectation is that in the ordinary course of business
planning, the actor will perform a cost/benefit analysis to make sure
that the positive values generated by the activity justify its costs.
Here, I remind the students of the famous Learned Hand Carroll Towing
formula19 comparing B vs. PL, where B represents the costs of accident
avoidance (or of refraining from the activity when avoidance is
impossible or too costly); and P x L (probability of the harm multiplied
by the gravity of the harm) reflects foreseeable accident costs.20 The
tort theory that evolved from this and similar cost/benefit approaches
is called "market deterrence." The notion is that liability rules should
be designed to induce the actor who is in the best position to conduct
this kind of cost/benefit analysis with respect to a given activity to
actually conduct it. Such actors will have incentives to make their
products and activities safer and/or to develop safer substitute
products and activities.21 Actors will then pass each activity‟s
residual accident costs on to consumers by "fractionating" and
"spreading" such costs through their pricing decisions. As a result,
prices will give consumers an accurate picture of the true social costs
of the activity, including its accident costs. Consumers are thus
enabled to make rational decisions about whether to continue purchasing
the product or activity in light of its accident as well as its
production costs. In principle, if a particular actor produces an unduly
risky product (in the sense that its accident costs are above "market
level"), that actor‟s products will be priced above market, and he/she
will be driven out of business.22 Tort rules have long been crafted with
an eye toward compelling risky but socially valuable activities or
enterprises to internalize their external costs. My examples---to which
the students were exposed in first year---are the ancient rule imposing
strict liability for crop damage caused by escaping livestock;23 strict
liability under the doctrine of Rylands v. Fletcher for the escape of
dangerous things brought onto one‟s property;24 strict liability under
Restatement (Second) § 519 for damage caused by "abnormally dangerous
activities" such as dynamite blasting;25 and most recently, strict
products liability.26 Of course, there are many exceptions to this
approach. For example, "unavoidably unsafe" or "Comment k products" are
deemed non-defective and therefore do not carry strict liability. And of
course the U.S. largely rejected Rylands. Why was that? Because, as was
memorably stated in Losee v. Buchanan: "We must have factories,
machinery, dams, canals and railroads. They are demanded by the manifold
wants of mankind, and lay at the basis of all our civilization."27 In
assuming that entrepreneurial capitalism would be stymied if enterprises
were obliged to pay for the harms they cause, the Losee court accepted a
strong version of TIC. Time permitting, I touch briefly on the debate
about whether the flourishing of the negligence principle in the U.S.
subsidized 19th century entrepreneurial capitalism,28 the possible
implications of the Coase Theorem for our discussion of Local 1330,29
and the debate about whether it is appropriate for courts to fashion
common law rules with an eye toward their distributive as well as
efficiency consequences.30 With this as background, I argue that the
District Court should have treated capital mobility---investors‟
circulation of capital in search of the highest rate of return---as a
risky but socially valuable activity warranting the same legal treatment
as straying cattle and dynamite blasting. Capital mobility is socially
valuable. It is indispensable for economic growth and flexibility.
Capital mobility generates important positive externalities for
"winners," such as economic development and job-creation at the new site
of investment. However, capital mobility also predictably causes
negative external effects on "bystanders" (the ones economists quaintly
label "the losers"). We discussed some of these externalities at the
outset of the class---the trauma associated with income interruption and
pre-mature retirement, waste or destruction of human capital, multiplier
effects on the local economy, and social pathologies and community
decline of the kind experienced in Youngstown. The plaintiffs should
have argued that capital mobility must internalize its social
dislocation costs for reasons of economic efficiency, and that this can
be accomplished by making investors strictly liable in tort for the
social dislocation costs proximately caused by their capital mobility
decisions. An investor considering shifting capital from one use to
another will compare their respective rates of return. In theory, the
investment with the higher return is socially optimal (as well as more
profitable for the individual investor). The higher-return investment
enlarges the proverbial pie. But investors must perform accurate
comparisons of competing investment opportunities in order for the magic
hand of the market to perform its magic. A rational investor bases her
analysis primarily on price signals reflecting estimated rates of return
on alternative investment options. This comparison will yield an
irrational judgment leading to a socially suboptimal investment decision
unless the estimated rate of return on the new investment reflects its
external effects, both positive and negative. Investors often have
public-relations incentives to tout the positive economic consequences
promised at the new location. To guarantee rational decision making, the
law must force investors contemplating withdrawal of capital from an
enterprise to also carefully consider the negative social dislocation
costs properly attributable to the activity of disinvestment. This can
be achieved by making capital mobility strictly liable for its
proximately caused social dislocation costs.31 This approach erects no
inefficient barriers to capital mobility, nor does it bar all
disinvestment decisions that may cause disruption and loss in the exit
community. Other things being equal, if the new investment discounted by
the social dislocation costs of exit will generate a higher rate of
return than the current use of the capital, the capital should be
disinvested from the old use and transferred to the new use. However, if
investors are not forced by liability rules to take into account the
social dislocation costs of disinvestment, the new investment
opportunity will appear more attractive than it really is in a social
sense. The situation involves a classic form of market failure. The
market is imperfect because investors are not obliged to take into
account the negative social dislocation costs proximately caused by
their decisions. Inaccurate price signals lead to the overproduction of
capital movement and therefore to a suboptimal allocation of resources.
Apart from any severance and unemployment benefits received by workers
at the old plant, the social dislocation costs of disinvestment are
almost entirely externalized onto the workers and the surrounding
community. Strict tort liability will induce investors and their
downstream customers to fractionate and spread the dislocation costs of
capital mobility when pricing the products of the new activity. This
will provide those who use or benefit from the new activity at the
destination community more accurate signals as to its true social costs
and oblige them to fractionally share in the misfortunes afflicting the
departure community. Suppose, for example, that U.S. Steel invested the
money it took out of Youngstown toward construction of a modern,
high-tech steel mill in a Sunbelt state. The price of steel produced at
the new mill should fractionally reflect social dislocation costs in
Youngstown. According to legal "common sense" and mainstream economic
theory, the movement of capital from a lesser to a more profitable
investment is an unambiguous social good. Allowing capital to migrate to
its highest rate of return guarantees that society‟s resources are
devoted to their most productive uses. Society as a whole is better off
if capital is permitted freely to migrate to the new investment and
there to grow the pie. In short, the free mobility of capital maximizes
aggregate welfare. We are all "winners" in the long run, even if some
unfortunate "losers" might get hurt along the way. It follows as an
article of faith that any legal inhibition on the mobility of capital is
inefficient and socially wasteful. This is why mainstream legal thinking
refuses to accord long-term workers or surrounding communities any sort
of "property interest" in the enterprise which a departing investor is
obliged to buy out before removal.32 An unwritten, bed-rock assumption
of US law is that capital is not and should not be legally responsible
for the social dislocation costs occasioned by its mobility.33 Such
costs are mostly externalized onto employees and the surrounding
community, even if the exit community had subsidized the old investment
with tax breaks and similar forms of corporate welfare. The legal common
sense about capital mobility is mistaken. It is not a priori true that
the movement of capital toward the greatest rate of return unambiguously
enhances aggregate social welfare. Free capital mobility maximizes
aggregate welfare and allocates resources to their most productive uses
only in a perfect market; that is, only in the absence of market
failure. The claim that free capital mobility is efficient is sometimes
true, and sometimes it is not. It all depends on the particular facts
and circumstances on the ground. Voilà. Judge Lambros was wrong. In
1980, a mechanism did exist in our law to recognize the plaintiffs‟
claims and afford them substantial relief for economic, emotional, and
other losses.34 All that was required was a logical extension of
familiar torts thinking. Had Judge Lambros correctly applied well-known
and time-honored torts principles, he would have treated the social
dislocation costs of the plant closure as an externality that must be
embedded in U.S. Steel‟s calculations regarding the relative
profitability of the old and new uses to which it might put its capital.
This would close the gap between private and social costs, thereby
tending to perfect the market. Notice an important rhetorical advantage
of this theory---its core value is economic efficiency. The plaintiffs
can get this far along in their argument without mentioning "fairness,"
"equity," or "justice," let alone "human rights," values that are often
fatal to legal argument in U.S. courts today.35 I now brace myself for
the "you gotta be kidding me" phase of the discussion. Objections
cascade in. The progressive students want to be convinced that this is
really happening. The mainstream students want to poke holes and debunk.
A few of them are grateful at last for an opportunity to show how
misguided they always knew my teaching was. Always, students assert that
my summary discussion of the cost/benefit analysis omitted various costs
and benefits. For example, one year I omitted to say that the social
dislocation costs in the exit community must be discounted by
ameliorative public expenditures such as unemployment insurance
benefits. My response to this type of objection is always the same: "you
are absolutely right, that cost or benefit should be included in the
analysis. And here are a few more considerations we would need to
address to perfect the cost/benefit analysis which I left out only in
the interest of time." But I learn from this discussion; not
infrequently, students contribute something I had not previously
considered. A frequent objection is that the task of quantifying the
social dislocation costs associated with capital mobility is just too
complicated and difficult. I concede that it is a complex task and that
conservative estimates might be required in place of absolute precision.
I ask, however, whether it is preferable to allow investors to proceed
on the basis of price-signals we know to be wrong or to induce them to
use best efforts to arrive at fair estimates. Separation of powers
always comes up, as it should. I go through the usual riffs. Yes, I
concede, these problems cry out for a comprehensive legislative solution
rather than case-by-case adjudication. But standard, well-known
counter-arguments suggest that Judge Lambros should nevertheless have
imposed tort liability in this case. For one thing, determining the
rules of tort liability has always been within the province of courts.
Deferring to the status quo (that those who move capital are not legally
responsible for negative externalities) is every bit as much a choice,
every bit as much "activism" or "social engineering," as altering the
status quo. Legal history is filled with cases in which the legislature
was only prompted to address an important public policy concern by the
shock value of a court decision. Particularly is this so in cases
involving the rights and interests of marginalized, insular, and
under-represented groups like aging industrial workers. I note that
Congress eventually responded to the plant closing problem with the WARN
Act, a modest but not unimportant effort to internalize to enterprises
some of the social dislocation costs of capital disinvestment. The
statute liquidates these costs into a sum equal to sixty days‟ pay after
an employer orders a plant closing or mass layoff without giving proper
notice.36 I call the students‟ attention to the provision of WARN
barring federal courts from enjoining plant closings37 and ask why
Congress might have included that restriction. Another common objection
concerns causation. A student will say: "The closedown of the mills, let
alone the shutdown of any particular plant, could not have caused all of
the suicides, heart failures, domestic violence, and so on, in
Youngstown. Surely many such tragedies would have occurred anyway, even
if U.S. Steel had remained. It isn‟t fair to impose liability on U.S.
Steel for everything bad that happened in Youngstown during the
statute-of-limitations period." I immediately say that this is a
terrific point, and that I was hoping someone would raise it. I
compliment the student by saying that the question shows that he/she is
now tapping legal knowledge. Typically, the class is concerned with
causation-in-fact or "but for" causation. Their question is, how do we
know that a plant shutdown caused any particular case of heart failure
or suicide in Youngstown? Problems of causal uncertainty are a familiar
issue, and I remind students that they were exposed to several
well-known responses in Torts. A time-honored, if simplistic device is
to shift the burden of proof regarding causationinfact to the defendant,
when everyone knows full well that the defendant has no more information
than the plaintiff with which to resolve the problem of causal
uncertainty.38 In recent decades, courts have developed more
sophisticated responses to problems of causal uncertainty as, for
example, in the DES cases. As the court stated in Sindell:39 In our
contemporary complex industrialized society, advances in science and
technology create fungible goods which may harm consumers and which
cannot be traced to any specific producer. The response of the courts
can be either to adhere rigidly to prior doctrine, denying recovery to
those injured by such products, or to fashion remedies to meet these
changing needs. Just as Justice Traynor in his landmark concurring
opinion in Escola . . . recognized that in an era of mass production and
complex marketing methods the traditional standard of negligence was
insufficient to govern the obligations of manufacturer to consumer, so
should we acknowledge that some adaptation of the rules of causation and
liability may be appropriate in these recurring circumstances . . . .40
At this point, some of the progressive students are beginning to
salivate. They came to law school with the hope that legal reasoning
would provide them a highly refined and politically neutral technology
for speaking truth to power. The first semester disabuses most of them
of that crazy idea. They have learned that they will not find certainty
or answers in legal discourse, and that legal texts are minefields of
gaps, conflicts, and ambiguities with moral and political implications.
I can tell from the glint in their eyes that they are beginning to ask
themselves whether this economics stuff, which they formerly shunned
like the plague, might provide a substitute toolbox of neutral
technologies with which to demonstrate that redress for workers and
other subordinated and marginalized groups is legally required. I cannot
allow them to think that. Therefore, unless an alert student has spotted
it, I now reveal my Achilles‟ heel. The weak link in my argument is the
age-old question of proximate causation. Assume we solve the
causation-in-fact problem. For example, assume that by analogy to the
Sindell theory of market-share liability, the court arrives at a fair
method of attributing to the plant shutdown some portion of the social
trauma and injuries occurring in the wake of U.S. Steel‟s departure from
Youngstown. How do we know whether the plant closing proximately caused
these harms? What do we mean by "proximate causation" anyway, and why
does it matter? These questions present another exciting, teachable
moment. Naturally, the students haven‟t thought about proximate cause
since first year. They barely remember what it is and how it differs
from causation-in-fact. Some 3Ls shuffle uncomfortably knowing that the
Bar examination looms, and they are soon going to need to know about
this. I provide a quick review of proximate causation which addresses
the question, how far down the chain of causation should liability
reach? I illustrate my points by referring to Palsgraf v. Long Island
R.R,41 which all law students remember. Perhaps U.S. Steel might fairly
be held accountable for the suicide of steelworkers within ninety days
of the plant closing, but we might draw the line before holding U.S.
Steel liable for a stroke suffered by a steelworker‟s spouse five years
later. Now keyed in to what proximate cause doctrine is about, the
students eagerly wait for me to tell them what the "answer" is, that is,
where proximate causation doctrine would draw the line in the Youngstown
case. That‟s when I give them the bad news. I explain that proximate
causation doctrine does not provide a determinate analytical method for
measuring the scope of liability. We pretend that buzzwords like
"reasonable foreseeability" or "scope-of-the-risk" give us answers, but
ultimately decisions made under the rubric of proximate causation are
always value judgments.42 The conclusion that "X proximately caused Y"
is a statement about the type of society we want to live in. At this
juncture, the 3Ls grumpily realize that I am not going to be much help
in preparing them for their bar review course. I now distribute a
one-page hand-out on proximate causation prepared in advance. The
handout reprints Justice Andrews‟ remarkable observation in his Palsgraf
dissent: What we . . . mean by the word „proximate‟ is, that because of
convenience, of public policy, of a rough sense of justice, the law
arbitrarily declines to trace a series of events beyond a certain point.
This is not logic. It is practical politics . . . . It is all a question
of expediency. There are no fixed rules to govern our judgment. There
are simply matters of which we may take account.43 I point out that
causation-in-fact analysis, too, always involves perspective and value
judgments.44 Why assume that water escaping the reservoir diminished the
value of the neighboring coal mining company‟s land? Why not assume that
the coal company‟s decision to dig close to the border diminished the
value of the manufacturer‟s land (by increasing the cost of using the
type of reservoir needed in its production process)? For that matter,
why assume that the cattle trample on the neighbors‟ crops? Why not
assume that the crops get in the way of the cattle? My handout also
contains my variation on Robert Keeton‟s famous definition of proximate
cause45: When a court states that „the defendant‟s conduct was the
proximate cause of (some portion of) the plaintiff‟s injuries,‟ what the
court means is that (1) the defendant‟s conduct was a cause-in-fact of
that portion of plaintiff‟s injuries; and (2) the defendant‟s conduct
and the plaintiff‟s specified injuries are so related that it is
appropriate, from the moral and social-policy points of view, to hold
the defendant legally responsible for that portion of the plaintiff‟s
injuries. What we mean when we ask whether the social dislocation costs
associated with the shutdown of the steel plant were proximately caused
by capital mobility is whether these costs are, in whole or in part,
properly attributable from a moral/political point of view to U.S.
Steel‟s decision to disinvest. Economic "science" does not and cannot
establish in a value-neutral manner that the social dislocation costs of
the plant shutdown are a negative externality of capital mobility. A
conclusion of that kind requires a value judgment that we disguise under
the rubric of "proximate causation," a value judgment about whom it is
appropriate to ask to bear what costs related to what injuries. The
lesson is that [in legal reasoning]{.underline} **[there is no
escape]{.underline}** **[from moral and political choice]{.underline}**.
If things have gone according to plan, time conveniently runs out, and
the class is dismissed on that note. What am I trying to accomplish in a
class like this? What are the objectives of critical legal pedagogy?
[[Legal education should]{.underline} **[empower

Blackness: Beyond the Middle Passage Epistemology," pp. 147-55, endnote
on p. 188)

When interpellated through the Middle Passage epistemology, Blackness
has a limited set of qualitative values or denotations that link it to
the events in that epistemology such as the commitment to collective and
individual struggle, "racial uplift," and the maintenance of strong
communities through "traditional" or heteropatriarchal family
structures. More [[generally]{.mark}, the Middle Passage
epistemology]{.underline} ([like]{.underline} other [established Black
linear progress or antiprogress
narratives]{.underline}---**[e.g.]{.underline}**, Afrocentrism,
PanAfricanism, Negritude, **[[Afropessimism]{.underline}]{.mark}**)10
also [[**links all Black collectives** across the Diaspora **to the
experience of racism**]{.underline}]{.mark} and the need to overcome
it---so how can Ramses II be "Black"? Even further, what does it mean
for us to claim him as "Black"? It is hard to interpellate Ramses (or
any of the other African kings, queens, leaders, intellectuals,
politicians, scientists, etc., whose physiognomy we would acknowledge as
stereotypically "Black") within the qualitative definition of Middle
Passage Blackness as making common cause with African Americans---or any
other "Black" community fighting racism and seeking socioeconomic and
political equality in the African Diaspora. In attempting to
interpellate Ramses within this definition, [[we]{.underline}]{.mark}
must [[produce Blackness as a fixed identity that transcends time and
space]{.underline}]{.mark}; through this, Ramses no longer belongs to
his own spacetime but retroactively becomes a denigrated "Negro" who
must combat his oppression. A paradox or---as Massey terms it, "a
dichotomous result"---now confronts us: was Ramses II a Black freedom
fighter or a ruler of extraordinary and largely unquestioned power, one
of the greatest and most oppressive in the history of Egyptian pharaohs?
[It is [the]{.mark} qualitative [definition]{.mark} of Black progress
that [creates this dichotomy, a paradox that then "empties out"]{.mark}
all [meaning]{.mark} in qualitative collapse]{.underline}. The attempt
to interpellate Ramses II through a Black progress narrative exposes the
continuing attempt and subsequent failure of the progress narrative to
interpellate Ramses. He is Black because he is a Black African, but he
is not Black, because neither "Black" nor "African" operated as
identities in Ramses's spacetime. Ramses II's life speaks to the
greatness of African empires, but his unapologetic use of massive slave
labor should "expel" him from Black progressive membership, the same way
in which some discourses attempt to expel Blacks whose actions
deliberately harmed other Blacks. [While we should]{.underline} perhaps
[not lose sleep over the "odd individual" whose]{.underline} terrible
[behaviors bar]{.underline} him, her, or [them from]{.underline} full or
perhaps even partial mention in [a Black progress
narrative]{.underline}, there are other Black individuals who are barred
from mention who have not acted against the principle of striving for
collective progress. [[This]{.mark} dichotomy]{.underline} also
[[threatens]{.mark} to create interpellative problems for [Blacks
who]{.mark}]{.underline}, unlike the Egyptian pharaoh, [[move across the
Atlantic]{.mark} at the same time as millions of Black Africans are
being sailed to and sold into the Americas]{.underline}, **[[but not in
the same directions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, veering away from our
progress narrative. **[Black [slaves transported]{.mark} outside of the
Americas [to Europe, India, and elsewhere do not retain a collective
identity]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[They]{.underline}]{.mark} are sold
individually and [[disappear]{.mark} into households]{.underline},
perhaps [factories, fields]{.underline}, or country [roads and city
streets]{.underline}, intersecting with populations at large. [From the
point of view of Black linear]{.underline} progress
[narratives]{.underline}, progress has not been achieved because the
collective has evanesced (and is therefore unable to achieve its goal of
overcoming racism), or read another way, [their histories have become
irrelevant to the collective historical theme of overcoming
racism]{.underline}. [Qualitatively speaking, [it appears **difficult if
not impossible**]{.mark} [to interpellate Blackness using a Black
Atlantic linear]{.mark}]{.underline} progress [[narrative]{.mark} in a
significant and lasting way]{.underline}. In "The World Is All of One
Piece: The African Diaspora and Transportation to Australia," which is
included in Ruth Simms Hamilton's book Routes of Passage, Cassandra
Pybus reprises a version of Sidney Mintz's question about the
qualitative limits of Black Atlantic studies: [[A **transnational
historical consciousness**]{.mark} and a capacity to encompass
experience in disparate time and space [are great strengths of African
diaspora studies]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[In so far as there is a
weakness, it is that the Atlantic world remains the locus of
discussion]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [While some attention has begun to
drift toward the Indian Ocean, less]{.underline} scholarship [has been
directed toward the distant Pacific]{.underline}. . . . In the diaspora
at the detailed penal transportation records we can find information
about the African end of the eighteenth century that is very hard to
come by elsewhere and that points in directions in which historians may
not otherwise look.11 Pybus understands that her topic is framed by
African Diaspora studies yet constrained by its "Atlantic focus"; she
then observes that despite this swirl of scholarly activity in the
Atlantic, there is a "drift" and "direction" toward the Indian Ocean and
the "distant Pacific." This passage draws a connecting line moving
horizontally (well, south by southeast) from the moment of the American
Revolution in the Middle Passage timeline to other moments in those
kingdoms and empires that border the Indian Ocean and, more
specifically, to the moment of the British penal colony of Australia. By
moving us horizontally into the Pacific, Pybus traces the journey of
those (primarily) U.S. Blacks who allied with the defeated British and
accompanied them on their return to England. Once there, the promised
support from the Crown never materialized, and many of these former
soldiers, spies, and support staff found themselves on the London
streets. These (primarily) men would have been in competition with an
already burgeoning class of the dispossessed filling the streets of
London and other industrial centers. As Robert Hughes argues in his
monumental history of the settling of white Australia, The Fatal Shore,
land grabs by the aristocracy and the replacement of cottage industries
with large industrialized factories deprived farmers, laborers, and
urban workers of their former careers as well as prospects for new ones
(many machines, such as looms, required fewer adult workers). Theft,
especially with the poor now rubbing shoulders with the wealthy in
crowded urban centers, skyrocketed, and Parliament responded with deeply
punitive measures; to steal a bit of ribbon or bread could send you to
prison or heavy labor or, most fearful of all, condemn you to
"transport" (to a British penal colony). With the American colonies no
longer available for convicts, Britain turned to its recently neglected
"discovery" of Australia as a convenient replacement, and so white and
Black Britons, along with a few U.S. and Caribbean Blacks, found
themselves transported as part of the First Fleet settlers. Pybus's
second horizontal reading comes, counterintuitively, mostly through
records created by hierarchies such as court, maritime, colonial, and
penal records, due to the paucity of "horizontal" archives
(correspondence between peers, diaries, etc.). Pybus, not unlike Hughes
in The Fatal Shore, constructs a horizontal narrative of these Black
convicts and settlers through (unavoidably) mostly vertical archival
sources: state, judicial, colonial, and penal records that read these
human beings as mere numbers filling ships, accepting punishment, and
perhaps enriching the Crown through forced labor. To an even greater
extent than Hughes, Pybus works to retrieve the very multivalent human
experiences behind these records of discipline and punishment, to see
the interactions denoted, denounced, and pronounced through their eyes,
so to speak, looking out horizontally rather than down from the (at
least figurative) heights of the judge's bench and foreman's lash. [[Yet
despite]{.underline}]{.mark} these [two [horizontal
readings]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [qualitative collapse
looms]{.underline}]{.mark} here [[because Pybus has framed]{.mark} this
[history as a **horizontal connection to**]{.mark} what is ultimately
**[a vertical framework that finds meaning in the struggle against
racism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Pybus's Black Founders offers us a
notable exception to our assumptions about Blackness, but in her work,
as in other histories she mentions, Blackness evanesces as the convicts
and settlers perhaps married, procreated, and most certainly died
without moving a coherent Black Atlantic collective forward in its quest
for equality in a majority white society. Or, rather more complicatedly,
in Black Founders Blackness evanesces into either the white Australian
population or the Australian Aboriginal population, in the latter case
an indigenous Blackness. Most likely reflecting on this, Pybus herself
does not think that this discovery of Australia's "Black founders"
radically changes the history of the African Diaspora or Australia: "My
point is not that this cohort of convicts is especially significant to
the history of Australia---though it certainly challenges the
conventional reading of the colonial experience---but to examine what it
can tell us about the wider world."12 If we add Epiphenomenal time to
our Black Atlantic frame, however, we can avoid the qualitative collapse
that (re)produces these histories as interesting in their own right but
marginal to our understanding of Black Atlantic history. Interpellated
through Epiphenomenal time, the Blackness in Black Founders first
changes a person's relationship to Blackness and indigeneity. Rather
than simply "losing" indigenous status once captured and then sold,
Blackness intersects twice more with indigeneity, and on two continents:
North America and Australia. In both cases, indigenous peoples sometimes
helped Black slaves escape, the latter often marrying into specific
American Indian nations. Middle Passage U.S. Blackness now shares a
spacetime through indigeneity and raises questions about Central and
South American intersections (such as the Garifunas of Nicaragua).13 One
might also see a third, more controversial intersection, between U.S.
Blacks who "returned" to establish the free state of Liberia and the
indigenous populations who found themselves oppressed in the resulting
socioeconomic and political hierarchy. The qualitative value of Pybus's
Blackness now meaningfully intersects with the Americas but is not
swallowed by it, because the frame is horizontally comparative rather
than vertically subordinating. The intersection of Blackness with
indigeneity in the Americas, Australia, and Africa also subverts the
notion of a "purely" diasporic Blackness, even within the progress
narrative itself, because the latter honors indigeneity as the "origin"
to which the collective must eventually return. In this moment of
interpellation, origin/home is achieved not necessarily through return
but through intersections with other "first nations" in the Atlantic and
Pacific. Even further, we can see how Blackness, in intersecting with
indigeneity when (formally) seeking "return," as in Liberia, might
produce not egalitarian unity but instead oppressive hierarchy. Black
Founders also provides us with perhaps unheard of dimensions of
Blackness that, once recognized, might usefully connect to other
possible spacetimes that share this dimension. As noted before, the
"Atlantic Blacks" who arrived with the First Fleet and on subsequent
convict ships experienced a range of lives or careers that cannot be
summed up through one collective trajectory, especially that of the
progress narrative. Pybus shows that in our present moment of reading,
Blackness becomes ambiguous in its meaning in these early colonies. On
the one hand, racial designations are clearly marked in the official
records, but unlike in the Americas, socioeconomic and political castes
are not created to wholly segregate them. There are many marriages one
would designate as "interracial," but even if one could access some
understanding of how "interracial marriage" would translate in this
spacetime, marriage is rarely an ideal that denotes the cessation of
difficulties over differences. As more than one wag has pointed out, the
dominance of heterosexual marriage certainly does not reflect an
egalitarian harmony of relations between the sexes. The marriages in
question are thus racialized outside of social racializations, meaning
that to be Black in these colonies does not automatically designate a
subaltern status below that of whites. In cases where Black convicts
were executed or subjected to physical punishment (whipping was the most
common), we might see racially motivated causes, but in the brutal tide
of regular executions and torturous punishment, it is difficult to
extrapolate consistently a narrative in which this Blackness can be
separated from the brutal imperial and capitalist caste system that
ruled all British subjects, including the white working poor. Blacks
intermixing with the white working poor populations in England and
Australia intersect with similar interactions during the earlier
spacetime of indentured servitude in the United States and the later one
of late nineteenth-century Irish immigration to northeastern urban
centers of the United States. If we step back from Pybus's initial
frame, which connects the history of the Black Atlantic in Australia
horizontally, and instead honor the horizontality of her interpellations
of Black individuals and their intersections (through marriage, penal
life, executions, manumission, etc.), one can read this history as a
series of moments that intersect not only with Black Atlantic histories
in the Americas but also with histories in Europe, Africa, and perhaps
India. It should be noted that, while we are discovering intersections
of collectives, we do so wholly within idealist frameworks that can be
further interpellated only through individuals who make up those
collectives; beneficially, however, the collective identities that
intersect with these individuals produce yet more collectives in more
spacetimes---more dimensions of Blackness across the Atlantic, Pacific,
and Indian Oceans. While the era of the Middle Passage produces many and
varied kinds of Blackness through the intersection of linear and
Epiphenomenal time, the conflated eras of World War II and the postwar
era offer yet more. I understand World War II and the postwar period as
a conflation of eras because it is impossible to pinpoint where one ends
and the other begins; however, when we are operating with Epiphenomenal
time, this ambiguity is productive rather than restrictive. Indeed,
breadth, depth, ambiguity, ambivalence, and dominance are the strengths
contributed by these overlapping eras: breadth because World War II
involved almost the majority of Black Africans and Black Diasporans
across the globe, whereas slavery---which forms the cornerstone of the
Middle Passage epistemology---did not; depth because the various
narratives, such as that of Black African men attempting to resist
forcible conscription by French and British colonial forces, or that of
African American men and women who fought for the right to be drafted,
require explanation and further research; ambiguity because we find
Blackness where we do not expect it and struggle to interpret it, such
as Black German individuals who served in Hitler's army and Black
Brazilian troops tasked with defending Italy; ambivalence because it is
a war and its equally destructive aftermath ironically connects the
African Diaspora many times over with ease and diversity; and finally,
dominance because World War II and the postwar era constructed an
interpellative frame that has been used by so many across the globe, a
frame that highlights the contemporary and global importance of
Blackness far more frequently than themes of the Middle Passage ever do.
While the rise of the BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia, India, and China),
the Arab Spring, and other sociopolitical and economic events seem to
signal the framing of a new era, journalists, pundits, and politicians
alike still interpret many of these events as effects of the World War
II/postwar era. Even the most rigid histories cannot sustain a
completely linear Second World War narrative. For example, the invasion
of Poland in 1939 must be explained by the rise of Nazism, which perhaps
requires a notation about the Versailles Treaty. Likewise, the bombing
of Pearl Harbor is necessary to explain the entrance of the United
States into the war as a direct combatant. The Second World War,
therefore, has at least two beginnings and, even by conservative
estimates, at least two endings: the surrender of the Nazis in Berlin
and the signed surrender by the Japanese on the USS Missouri in Tokyo
Bay. This gives us a war with at least two timelines to which there
correspond two themes, two notions of progress, and many ways in which
occupied nations must be understood: as collaborators, as wholly
oppressed, as underground resisters, and so on. This nonlinear set of
peoples, places, and events forces anyone seeking interpellations
through World War II to accept all the exceptions to its linear progress
narrative---that is, it forces researchers to incorporate great nuance
into their interpellations (in asking when the Second World War ended,
for example, we have to amend the question to reflect all the surrenders
and dates that dominant discourses on World War II cite in response
because, whether there were multiple wars or one great war may be a
matter of definition, but there is no question that there were multiple
narratives that intersected). This means that qualitative collapse will
occur less frequently in interpellations made through a wholly linear
progress narrative on the war (because dominant discourses do not offer,
really, any wholly linear narratives of it), but when it does, the
effect is almost always "deafening," as if it were drowning out
alternative interpellations.14 Blackness can manifest through this
multidimensionality, in most cases quite easily. In contrast to the
difficulty involved in explaining how Blacks from the Atlantic found
themselves in Australia, the global reach of the Second World War makes
it easy to explain how Blackness has spread almost everywhere. When
using both Epiphenomenal and linear spacetimes to interpellate Blackness
in these eras, no long, creative narratives are needed to explain the
presence of West Africans under British rule, East Africans under
Italian Fascist rule, or the fight for equality both at home and abroad
that was the self-appointed task of many an African American man or
woman in uniform; moreover, using both spacetimes enables Black European
studies to explain without much difficulty how Blacks of African descent
came to fight under Hitler. We can arrive at these explanations by
starting with the individual, rather than the collective, as a point of
interpellation. We can then link such an individual to his, her, or
their variously realized collective identities (understanding that we
should never claim that an individual is fully realized, as we can work
within distinct spacetimes only as they are imagined in the now, not in
both the present and the past). Unfortunately, many of these dimensions
as interpellated through the postwar epistemology are easily achieved
through vertical structures: we need only locate (in ascending order) a
military battalion, a regiment, or a division that would contain Black
soldiers and its encampments and headquarters. Vertical readings alone
can often interpellate an agential and diverse Blackness: Black soldiers
and field nurses with agency, Black civilians with choices, and a whole
roster of intersections with a broad variety of peers (soldiers and
civilians) across vast geographies. At first glance, performing vertical
interpellations through linear narratives appears to bear the same fruit
as a horizontal reading: Blackness with agency and diversity. This might
explain why so many Black collective progress narratives of World War II
use this multidimensionality to produce hierarchical, or vertical,
interpellations for the collective. The "Windrush narrative" of Black
Britain, for example, readily narrates the contributions of Black
British Caribbeans in the Second World War, yet uses a progress
narrative to interpellate this Blackness. Like the histories of African
American men who fought for the United States during World War I, the
"Windrush" narrative underscores the painful hypocrisy of serving the
British Crown only to be treated as an undesirable emigrant in the
postwar era.15 Drawing on oral histories of service in the war and
archival records from the British War Office, Windrush: The Irresistible
Rise of Multi-Racial Britain (1999) interpellates Black Britishness as
agential and diverse, a proud component of the history of World War II
but of official British histories of the war more particularly.16 To be
sure, even when operating within World War II/postwar frameworks, we
encounter obstacles. Hierarchies of power are not (unfortunately) wholly
erased, and they can be complicated by the complexities of global
alliances and rivalries (no matter how easily they are manifested in the
postwar epistemology). The postwar epistemology's emphasis on the "now,"
in the absence of a geographical center (a component of even the most
traditional narratives of the Second World War/postwar era),17 allows,
say, Samoan warriors aiding the Allies to be interpellated through
collective identities that certainly include hierarchal structures
(e.g., the military command structure) but also relationships whereby
power must constantly be negotiated (e.g., in relationships between
soldiers or between soldiers and civilians). The "now" complicates
power, meaning that while an Epiphenomenal interpellation enables
agency, it will also reflect those vertical hierarchies that inevitably
accompany so many moments of interpellation in every individual life
across the globe.18 \*\*\*BEGIN ENDNOTE\*\*\* 18. [[One could

#### We need to look at a broader capitalistic approach greater than the militarization of the 1033 program due to the social death Capitalism constructs social death and now we can't deny the capitalistic misery because it's too great and is what creates fear, surveillance, and punishment even taking into consideration the death of black folks to militarized police having this be embedded as the DNA of American society.

SWAT teams now deployed to conduct even routine practices such as
carrying out raids on unlicensed barber shops, and raiding night clubs
in violation of liquor inspections, they have also become part of both a
huge security industry 'expected to grow to \$31 billion by 2014' and a
public and state spending program that amounts to '\$75 billion a year
on national security' (Greenwald, 2014). In 2013, SWAT teams in the
United States conducted over 80,000 raids, with '80 percent ... linked
to search warrants to investigate potential criminal suspects, not for
high-stakes "hostage, barricade, or active shooter scenarios"' (Chen,
2014). [[The militarization of American society is fueled by
a]{.underline}]{.mark} Department of Defense [[program labeled
1033]{.underline}]{.mark}, which 'has provided \$4.3 billion in free
military equipment to local police' (Chen, 2014). At the same time,
states have 'received at least \$34 billion in federal grants to
purchase military grade supplies in the decade after 9/11 ... . Even in
remote cities like Fargo, North Dakota, rated one of the safest cities
in America police officers have traveled with military style assault
rifles in their patrol cars' (Chen, 2014). What the arming of America
testifies to is not simply the militarizing of the police but a process
of militarization defined by Michael Geyer as the 'contradictory and
tense social process in which civil society organizes itself for the
production of violence' (cited in Womack, 2004; also see Gillis, 1989).
[[This speaks to a much broader threat to American society than the
arming of the police. In light of the ongoing militarization of American
society, I want to introduce a caveat. I think it is a mistake to simply
focus on the militarization of the police and their racist actions in
addressing the killing of Michael Brown. What we are witnessing in this
brutal killing and mobilization of state violence is symptomatic of the
neoliberal racist punishing state emerging all over the world, with its
encroaching machinery of social death.]{.underline}]{.mark} The
neoliberal killing machine is on the march globally. [[The spectacle of
neoliberal misery is too great to deny any more and the only mode of
control left by the corporate controlled societies is
violence]{.underline}]{.mark}, but a violence that is waged against the
new precariat, such as immigrant children, protesting youth, the
unemployed, and black youth. In the case of Michael Brown, it should be
clear that his death cannot be reduced to an isolated incident in a town
in which Whites are overwhelmingly in power. In fact, as Steven
Rosenfeld points out, According to the most recently available federal
crime statistics reported by USA Today, a white police officer killed a
black person at least twice a week in the U. S. from 2005 through 2012.
'The shooting of a black teenager in Ferguson, MO, last Saturday was not
an isolated event in American policing. Eighteen percent of the blacks
killed during those seven years were under age 21, compared to 8.7
percent of whites'. (Rosenfeld, 2013) [[The racist, symbolic, and
capacious violence now waged by the neoliberal state has become so
widespread]{.underline}]{.mark} that it permeates the news, media,
social networks, and online sources so as to become normalized rather
than a source of alarm. Yet, to the degree that neoliberal ideology is
in disarray, [[it becomes more and more obsessed with security and
expanding the punishing state.]{.underline}]{.mark} This suggests at one
level that [[neoliberal states can no longer justify and legitimate
their exercise of ruthless power and its effects under casino
capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}. Instead[[, the state no longer attempts
to produce consensus, but on reproducing a culture of
fear]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bauman, 2010, p. 8). But rather than
responding with palliative reforms, the neoliberal state appears both
obsessed with security and politically indifferent and ethically frozen
in light of the human suffering, exploitation, misery, and culture of
cruelty it produces. Part of this is due to the way in which global
corporate power is now separated from the politics of the nation state.
As Zygmunt Bauman andLeonidas Donskis observe: the advanced separation
aimed at divorce between power (the ability to see things done) and
politics (the capacity to decide what things are to be done), has
resulted in the 'ludicrous and degrading', all too manifest incapacity
of nation-state politics to perform its function. ... Power and politics
live and move in separation from each other and their divorce lurks
round the corner. On the one hand, there is power, safely roaming the
global expanses, free from political control and at liberty to select
its own targets; on the other, there is politics, squeezed and robbed of
all or nearly all of its power, muscles and teeth. (Bauman & Donskis,
2013, pp. 59--60) Yet, given the fact that corporate power now floats
above and beyond national boundaries, the financial elite can dispense
with political concessions in order to pursue their toxic agendas.
Moreover, as SlavojŽižek argues 'worldwide capitalism can no longer
sustain or tolerate ... global equality. It is just too much' (2013, p.
58). Moreover, in the face of massive inequality, increasing poverty,
the rise of the punishing state, and the attack on all public spheres,
[[neoliberalism cannot no longer pass itself off as synonymous with
democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}. The capitalist elite, whether they are
Hedge Fund managers, the new billionaires from Silicon Valley, or the
heads of banks and corporations, are no longer interested in ideology as
their chief mode of legitimation. Force is now the arbiter of their
power and ability to maintain control over the commanding institutions
of American society. Finally, I think it is fair to say that they are
too arrogant and indifferent to how the public feels. Neoliberal
capitalism has nothing to do with democracy and this has become more and
more evident among people, especially youth all over the globe. As Žižek
has observed, 'the link between democracy and capitalism has been
broken' (2013, p. 68). The important question of justice has been
subordinated to the violence of unreason, to a market logic that
divorces itself from social costs, and a ruling elite that has an
allegiance to nothing but profit and will do anything to protect their
interests. This is why I think it is dreadfully wrong to just talk about
the militarization of local police forces without recognizing that the
metaphor of 'war zone' is apt for a global politics in which the social
state and public spheres have been replaced by the machinery of finance,
the militarization of entire societies not just the police, and the
widespread use of punishment that extends from the prison to the schools
to the streets. Some have rightly argued that these tactics have been
going on in the black community for a long time and are not new (Nopper
& Kaba, 2014). Police violence certainly has been going on for some
time, but what is new is that the intensity of violence and the level
military-style machinery of death being employed is much more
sophisticated and deadly. For instance, as Kevin Zeese and Margaret
Flowers point out, the militarization of the police in the United States
is a recent phenomenon that dates back to 1971. They write: The
militarization of police is a more recent phenomenon \[and marks\] the
rapid rise of Police Paramilitary Units (PPUs, informally SWAT teams)
which are modeled after special operations teams in the military. PPUs
did not exist anywhere until 1971 when Los Angeles under the leadership
of the infamous police Chief Daryl Gates, formed the first one and used
it for demolishing homes with tanks equipped with battering rams. By
2000, there were 30,000 police SWAT teams \[and\] by the late 1990s, 89%
of police departments in cities of over 50,000 had PPUs, almost double
the mid-80 s figure; and in smaller towns of between 25,000 and 50,000
by 2007, 80% had a PPU quadrupling from 20% in the mid80 s.
\[Moreover,\] SWAT teams were active with 45,000 deployments in 2007
compared to 3,000 in the early 80 s. The most common use ... was for
serving drug search warrants where they were used 80% of the time, but
they were also increasingly used for patrolling neighborhoods. (Zeese &
Flowers, 2014) [[At the same time, the impact of the rapid
militarization of local police forces on poor black communities is
nothing short of terrifying and symptomatic of the violence that takes
place in advanced genocidal states.]{.underline}]{.mark} For instance,
according to a recent report, entitled 'Operation Ghetto Storm',
produced by the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement, 'police officers,
security guards, or self-appointed vigilantes extra judicially killed at
least 313 African Americans in 2012. ... This means a black person was
killed by a security officer every 28 hours'. The report suggests that
'the real number could be much higher' (Hudson, 2013).3 Glenn Greenwald
is right in arguing that 'abusive policing, police militarization is
overwhelmingly and disproportionately directed at minorities and poor
communities, ensuring that the problem largely festers in the dark'; it
also 'degrades the mentality of police forces in virtually every
negative way and subjects their target communities to rampant brutality
and unaccountable abuse' while posing 'grave and direct dangers to basic
political liberties, including rights of free speech, press and
assembly' (Greenwald, 2014). The emergence of the warrior cop and the
surveillance state go hand-in-hand and are indicative not only of state
sanctioned racism but also of the rise of the authoritarian state and
the dismantling of civil liberties. Brutality mixed with attacks on
freedom dissent, and peaceful protest harbor memories of past brutal
regimes such as the dictatorships in Latin America in the 1970s and
1980s. The events in Ferguson speak to a history of representation in
both the United States and abroad that Americans have chosen to forget
at their own risk. In spite of his generally right-wing political views,
Rand Paul got it right in arguing that [[When you couple this
militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and
due process that allows the police to become judge and jury--- national
security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants,
pre-conviction forfeiture---we begin to have a very serious problem on
our hands.]{.underline}]{.mark} Given these developments, it is almost
impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is
targeting them. Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice
system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their
government is particularly targeting them. (Paul, 2014)

#### The Alternative is to express moral outrage and engaging organized struggles to oppose and transform the capitalist society

What he does not name is the problem, which is a society marked 'by a
dangerous and unprecedented confluence of our democratic institutions
and the military' (Baker, 2009). As Danielle M. LaSusa (2014) observes,
[[the United States is a society that is not simply on the precipice of
authoritarianism but has fallen over the edge into what Hannah Arendt
once called 'dark times'.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Under the regime of
neoliberalism, the circle of those considered disposable and subject to
state violence is now expanding.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[The heavy hand
of the state is not only racist; it is also part of an authoritarian
mode of governance willing to do violence to anyone who threatens
neoliberal capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}, white Christian
fundamentalism, and the power of the
military-industrial-academic-surveillance state. [[America's embrace of
murderous weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} to be used on enemies abroad has
taken a new turn and now will be used on those considered disposable at
home. [[As the police become more militarized, the weapons of death
become more sophisticated and the legacy of killing civilians becomes
both an element of domestic as well as foreign policy. Amid the growing
intensity]{.underline}]{.mark} of state terrorism, [[violence becomes
the DNA of a society that refuses to deal with larger structural issues
such as massive inequality in wealth and power, a government that now
unapologetically serves the rich and powerful corporate interests, and
makes violence the organizing principle of
governance?]{.underline}]{.mark} (see, especially, Balko, 2013;
Alexander, 2010; Nelson, 2000[[) The worldwide response to what is
happening in Ferguson sheds a light on the racist and militarized nature
of American society so as to make its claim to democracy seem both
hypocritical and politically insipid. At the same time, such protests
make visible what Goya called the sleep of reason, a lapse in
witnessing, attentiveness, and the failure of conscience, which lie at
the heart of neoliberal's ongoing attempt to depoliticize the American
public.]{.mark}]{.underline} Political life has come alive once again in
America, moving away from its withdrawal into consumer fantasies and
privatized obsessions. [[The time has come to recognize that Ferguson is
not only about the violence and consolidation of white power and racism
in one town, it is also symptomatic of white power and the deep-seated
legacy of racism in the country as a whole, which goes along with what
America has become under the intensifying politics of market
fundamentalism, militarism, and disposability.]{.underline}]{.mark}
Ferguson prompts us to rethink the meaning of politics and to begin to
think not about reform but a major restructuring of our values,
institutions and notions of what a real democracy might look like. We
need to live in a country in which we are alarmed rather than
entertained by violence. [[It is time for the American to unite around
our shared fate as stakeholders in a radical democracy, rather than
being united around our shared fears and the toxic glue of state
terrorism and everyday violence. It is time to express a sense of moral
outrage and engage in organized struggles to oppose and transform a
society]{.underline}]{.mark} that as Susan Sontag has observed
'dissolves politics into pathology' (cited in Becker, 1997, p. 28)

#### Black bodies are [literal artillery]{.underline}---weapons of civil society to justify conflict and [reign terror]{.underline}. Flesh [severed]{.underline} from life, a metaphysical [nothingness]{.underline}, Blackness is left as a [machine]{.underline} whose only purpose is destruction. It is from this understanding of [arms]{.underline} that we choose to [descend]{.underline} from with regards to the topic.

**Warren '18** (Calvin Warren, Calvin Warren is an Assistant Professor
in WGSS. He received his B.A. in Rhetoric/Philosophy (College Scholar)
from Cornell University and his MA and Ph.D. in African
American/American Studies from Yale University, 2018, *Ontological
Terror: Blackness, Nihilism, and Emancipation*) \\\\EG

The question of value, then, reconfigures our proper metaphysical
question. In essence, it inquires about how to ground value of a being
lacking place in the world.32 The illustrators provide an answer to this
inquiry: since [[black being exists for **destruction**]{.mark}, why not
make this being [an extension of **war machines**]{.mark}?]{.underline}
In this fantasy, [black being is [a **sentient weapon**, blurring the
distinction between]{.mark} **machine** and flesh, [**weapon** and
body.]{.mark}]{.underline} Warfare provides value for sentient refuse.
[[Black bodies are]{.mark} literal [**artilleries** of destruction ---
there is no self]{.mark} to protect, [just]{.mark} an open
[**vulnerability** to deadly violence]{.mark}]{.underline}. We might
also suggest that the black weapon prefigures the suicide bomber, which
preoccupies contemporary analysis of necropolitics. But martyrdom is
absent from such an analysis because [[the black weapon is pure use
value.]{.underline}]{.mark} The weapon does not sacrifice itself;
[[**destruction** is its reason for existence]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Black weapons also lack any relationality between humans and a political
community from which to ground such self-sacrifice. Black death,
vulnerability, injury, and destruction are mere comedic by-products of a
war between humans. In the image, soldiers easily affix cannons to black
bodies and position these weapons in the line of fire. The battlefield
is precisely the space of emancipation --- a death-scape. And the being
emancipation creates in this space is the black weapon. [**War**
allegorizes the metaphysical holocaust, which places black being in
extraordinary harm]{.underline} without regard to any ontological ground
of resistance. [This war]{.underline}, unlike the Civil War, [is
**without end**. [The **black weapon** is]{.mark} being for another
[within an economy of brutality, **strategy**, and
calculation]{.mark}.]{.underline} This catachrestic fantasy realizes the
terror Heidegger envisioned with his critique of technological
reasoning. The complete collapse between technology and flesh could only
be realized with black being, and the image articulates this
understanding.33 It is unthinkable that the union soldiers would become
weapons because they are human beings. Thus, it is not just that the
image is viciously satirical, but also that the image exposes a kernel
of truth: [[it]{.mark} is indeed plausible that black being could be
used in such a way in an antiblack world.]{.underline} Humor encases a
metaphysical truth. [Black being lacks ontological security and [is
**malleable** in the hands of humans. This is **ontological
terror**.]{.mark}]{.underline} We might also revisit the Lacanian terms
enjoyment and interpassivity --- for it seems that both are operative in
the catachrestic fantasy[. The cynosure of [the image is a black
weapon]{.mark} with a minstrel-like smile]{.underline} (a smile that
indicates utter obsequiousness to vicious demands and unawareness of
immediate danger), [gladly [sitting]{.mark} on the ground [to facilitate
the **soldier's reloading**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The smile is a
signifier of stupid enjoyment, a masochistic embrace of destruction.
Through the smile, the black weapon is aligned with the nothing and all
the terror it entails. The smile, then, is the figuration of
interpassivity and enjoyment. [[The **terror** of nothing is projected
onto]{.mark} black bodies ([black weapons]{.mark} must hold the
**destructive** enjoyment for the white subject, standing as a
substitutional receptacle for the human's enjoyment),]{.underline} and
the enjoyment is vicious --- it is the enjoyment of continual
destruction (the metaphysical holocaust).34 The smile also dockets a
certain duty or obligation of black being --- to rejoice in destruction
as service (in this way, service as black suicide is inconceivable for
the illustrator; only honor and duty explain the stupid enjoyment. The
illustrators, then, impose a fallacious agency on the weapon, which is
part of the vicious humor, since a weapon has no choice in the
matter/manner of its destruction). And we might say the smile signals
"arbitrary \[black\] death as a legitimate feature of a system," as
Lewis Gordon poignantly notes.35 The arbitrariness of black perishment
exposes its meaningless enjoyment through the loss of meaning.36 [[The
metaphysical world is a **battlefield** for blacks, blacks
**reconfigured** as weapons for a war without end.]{.mark} At any
moment, at any time, blacks could perish]{.underline} --- or, to retool
Heidegger, this perishment occurs in einem Augenblick (in a blink of an
eye, or immediately). Again, I am using the term perishment over
Gordon's death to docket the utter lack of meaning and being black
destruction entails. [Thus, there can never be Ereignis for black
weapons, no event in which death enables an authentic embrace of being.
Heideggerian death is impossible for black being. [There is only death
as]{.mark} **perishment** --- meaningless, arbitrary, and [**eventless**
destruction]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The smile is the internecine
sign of this destruction. The smile, then, is absolutely essential to
the image (its punctum, to borrow Barthes's term).37 The smile gets us
to the essence of the image. What the black weapon is smiling at is
nothing. This, ultimately, is the fantasy the illustrator presents, and
it serves to disavow the brutal context within which the weapon is
placed. For the illustrator, blacks embrace the terroristic nothing
antiblackness imposes upon it. Imposition is recast as masochistic
embrace. The image stages an encounter with nothing as a dutiful embrace
of onticide. [[The black body is **finished**.]{.mark} The image
articulates the closure of metaphysics: the [black]{.mark} body [is
nothing more than an antiblack invention, an **instrument** of a
destructive]{.mark} will to [power]{.mark}]{.underline}. Any agency we
imagine we can extract from this body by reclaiming and celebrating it
has evaporated in a toxic atmosphere. [By closure, however, I do not
mean the end (as is the fantasy of some postmetaphysicians) but the
**completion** of its internecine aim concerning black being. [The
aim]{.mark}, the metaphysical enterprise, [is to **sever** the flesh
from the body through]{.mark} the work of [violence, **degradation**,
and terror, such that what is left is not a]{.mark} [human body, but
a]{.mark} body as **[machine]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This is what the
image proudly proclaims. The image, then, can be read as an antiblack
celebration, a triumph over black being (and the intransigent remainder
of the flesh). In his brilliant essay "The Black Body as Fetish,"
Anthony Farley argues that [[the black body]{.mark} serves as the object
of white fantasy; the body [is pressed into narratives of]{.mark}
savagery and **[degradation]{.mark}** to maintain white mastery and
racial innocence.]{.underline} Taking something like Žižek's advice,
"Enjoy your symptom," seriously,38 Farley suggests that a masochistic
embrace of the function of the black body in antiblack fantasy produces
pleasure (or jouissance):

#### The trope of criminality is engraved into the flesh of black bodies which makes blackness vulnerable to militarization and fuels the prison industrial complex 

**Harriot '18** (Michael Harriot is a world renowned wypipologist,
6-25-2018, \"Unprotected, Underserved: The (False) Criminalization of
Black America,\"
https://www.theroot.com/unprotected-underserved-the-false-criminalization-o-1827083795)//pshah

Any attempt at understanding the effects of policing in black America
must begin from a rational, objective perspective. [[We must]{.mark}
first [free ourselves from the]{.mark} accepted biased
[narrative]{.mark} [that accompanies enforcement of]{.mark} the [law in
black communities]{.mark}---namely that the negative effects of the
criminal-justice system are due to the disproportionate criminality of
the black population.]{.underline} Even the most passionate activists
and allies have subconsciously accepted the prevailing premise. They
will preface their arguments on police brutality by acknowledging the
plague of black-on-black crime and violence in the black community.
[They will acknowledge the fact that black people need to "put down the
guns," "stop the violence" and "do better." To be clear, all violence is
bad. We need to address all crime, whether it is the black-on-black
variety or the kind where white teenagers bring in military weapons to
their 10th-grade social studies class.]{.underline} Black people,
however, are just more likely to break the law, necessitating more
police scrutiny and harsher treatment by law enforcement officers. After
all, these officers are just looking at the statistics and doing their
jobs. But is it true? Is the disproportionate state violence against
black people a result of our disproportionate criminality? Do the
inequities in America's criminal-justice system reflect our misconduct?
Are black people policed this way because of racism? Or are police
brutality, mass incarceration and the war on black bodies a necessary
reality? Let's look at the facts. Numerous academic studies have shown
that crime is largely a socioeconomic phenomenon, including this one,
this one and this one by researchers at the University of Minnesota,
which states: Arrests statistics and much research indicate that poor
people are much more likely than wealthier people to commit street
crime. However, some scholars attribute the greater arrests of poor
people to social class bias against them. Despite this possibility,
[[most criminologists would]{.mark} probably [agree that social class
differences in criminal offending are "unmistakable]{.mark}." [The
disparity]{.mark} in crime and arrest rates [is because African
Americans are twice as likely to fall below the poverty index]{.mark}
and [poor whites are less likely to go to prison than even wealthy
blacks]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to a 2016 study by Duke
University and the New School. Poor people commit crimes, and black
communities, on average, tend to be poorer. Yet [[whenever the subject
of police brutality is brought up, people]{.mark} who belong to the
exclusive Greek-letter organization Mu Alpha Gamma Alpha (I'm pretty
sure that's what "MAGA" stands for) will [pull out]{.mark} their
[bibles]{.mark} [and turn to]{.mark} the newest
[testament]{.mark}---]{.underline}the arrest statistics from the FBI's
Uniform Crime Report. They will point out that African Americans were
arrested for more murders than whites. Therefore, they will explain,
black people are more violent. That's why cops lock them up and shoot
them in the face---case closed. But when one takes a look at all of the
data, the numbers tell a different story. [While [white women]{.mark}
might [clutch their purses when they encounter a black man]{.mark} in a
dark parking lot, in comparison with the black population, [whites
commit more than twice the number of rapes, aggravated assaults,
burglaries, larcenies, arsons, frauds, sex offenses, embezzlement,
disorderly conduct and drug abuse violations, according to FBI]{.mark}
numbers.]{.underline} Although it is true that black people, per capita,
commit crime at higher rates, the vast majority of people, black or
white, do not commit a crime in any given year. The per capita crime
rate is a useless factoid when the reality shows that 95 percent of
black people don't commit a crime in any given year. [[Whenever]{.mark}
almost [any kind of crime is committed]{.mark} in the U.S[., it
is]{.mark} far [more likely that the person responsible is
white]{.mark}. In fact, regarding the importance of per capita crime
rates, [B]{.mark}ureau of [J]{.mark}ustice [S]{.mark}tatistics data
[shows]{.mark} that [the rate of violence among]{.mark} poor, urban
[whites]{.mark} (56.4 per 1,000) [is higher than]{.mark} the violence
rate for urban [black]{.mark}]{.underline}[s]{.mark} (51.3 per 1,000).
Let's put it this way: [If a random police officer had to solve a random
crime without any clues and no knowledge of the perpetrator,
statistically, Officer Random would be right far more often if he
guessed that it was a white person]{.underline}. Furthermore, if
Detective Random stopped a white person on the street, the data shows
that that person is statistically as likely to be a criminal as any
black person. [And [yet black people continue to be policed more
violently and scrutinized]{.mark} more often by law enforcement.
[White]{.mark} [America]{.mark} continues to [push the narrative that
black people are violent criminals]{.mark}, even though the numbers
don't show it. But if we are going to examine black criminality, we must
also investigate the opposite side of the narrative: Are black people
actually targeted by law enforcement? Is it true that cops brutalize,
mistreat and kill black people disproportionately? Let's look at the
numbers: Over the past decade, cities and organizations like the
American Civil Liberties Union have compiled extensive reports and data
on traffic stops and pedestrian searches. The statistics are startling:
In San Francisco, [African Americans are 3.3 times]{.mark}, and Latinos
2.6 times, [more likely]{.mark} than whites [to be searched after a
traffic stop]{.mark}. But according to an ACLU report: "San Francisco
[police officers are significantly **less**]{.mark} [likely to find any
evidence of criminality in searches of African Americans or
Latino]{.mark}s." In Greensboro, N.C. (pdf), blacks made up 55 percent
of traffic stops and were more than twice as likely (102 percent) to be
stopped. However, white drivers were 9 percent more likely to have
contraband. Between 2011 and 2015, the Metropolitan Nashville (Tenn.)
Police Department stopped an average of 1,122 per 1,000 black
drivers---more black drivers than were living in the entire county.
Black drivers in Nashville were five times more likely than whites to be
stopped multiple times in a year. Every year, [more than 75 percent of
the people who were stopped and frisked]{.mark} by the New York City
Police Department [were black or Latino]{.mark}. In Philadelphia,
African Americans accounted for 69 percent of stop and frisks from
January to June 2017 in a city in which they are 48 percent of the
population.]{.underline} Almost every city that conducts these kinds of
studies finds the same results. But it is not just traffic and
pedestrian stops that reveal racially biased policing. [The [Hamilton
Project reveals]{.mark} that, even though [blacks and whites use drugs
at about the same rate, blacks are 6.5 times more likely to be
arrested]{.mark} for drug use.]{.underline} And when it comes to police
shootings, the data is incontrovertible. [A study by the American
Journal of Public Health shows that [black men are three times more
likely to die from police shootings]{.mark}. Even [when they are not
violent and have committed no crimes]{.mark}, black people are still
shot and killed by police officers at higher rates than whites. Although
black people make up 13 percent of the population, in 2017, 34 percent
of the people who were shot and killed when they were unarmed and not
attacking were black, Mapping Police Violence reports. To be clear,
[the]{.mark} disproportionate [number of black people shot by police is
not because black people commit]{.mark} more
[crimes]{.mark}]{.underline}. Data from the Washington Post's police
database shows that there is no correlation between crime rates by race
and the disproportionate number of police shootings. As Justin Nix, a
researcher at the University of Louisville, said, according to the
Washington Post, ["[The only thing that was significant in predicting
whether someone shot and killed by police was unarmed was whether or not
they were black." The facts don't support the
narrative]{.mark}.]{.underline} There is no reason to insert
black-on-black crime into any discussion of police violence. There is no
statistical basis for the way African-American communities are
inordinately victimized by law enforcement. Black criminality is a myth.
All this week, The Root will examine policing in black America. We will
delve into the problems, the perspectives and the solutions to the
inequities in how the law is enforced in communities of color across
America. Because as you can see \... They're doing it wrong.

This latest crisis had begun in the 1860s. [[In a moment]{.mark}
equivalent to a historical blink of the eye, [four million people were
transformed from property to human beings to would-be citizens of the
nation]{.mark}. Only a decade before, [few]{.mark} white
[Americans]{.mark} other than abolitionists [had anticipated that black
people would become]{.mark} the [legal equivalents]{.mark} of white
people. In those outrageously heady days of the 1850s [when slavery
debates still raged]{.mark}, colonization schemes were still being
hatched, and white optimism still percolated for black extinction if
emancipation had to come, [the possibility]{.mark} of living among and
abiding [black judges, politicians, and schoolteachers was]{.mark}, for
many, [unimaginable]{.mark}.2]{.underline} By decade's end the
unimaginable had become reality, and the prospect of settlement and
incorporation of African Americans added urgency and confusion to what
many whites already saw as a desperate situation. "Now, far more than at
any time hitherto[, the white people of the United States . . . seem to
be particularly interested to know precisely what manner of man the
negro \[sic\] is," proclaimed [one writer in his 1868
introduction]{.mark} to The Negroes in Negroland; The Negroes in
America; and Negroes Generally, a timely collection of previously
published statements by some of the most respected Europe an travelers
to Africa and American men of renown.]{.underline} "Of these American
writers, those from the North are here more particularly referred to;
and it is trusted that the reader will ponder well the words of such
truly able and representative men as John Adams, Daniel Webster, Horace
Mann, Theodore Parker, Samuel George Morton, William Henry Seward, and
others of scarcely less distinction." In a nutshell, "disinterested" and
authoritative white men the world over, from Europe an colonists and
anthropologists to American presidents and statesmen, had the same
warning to dispatch, according to Hinton Rowan Helper: ["[Negroes" with
their "crime- stained blackness" could not rise to a plane any higher
than that of "base and beastlike savagery]{.mark}."]{.underline} Helper
presented his collection of expert opinions as an archaeologist uses
fossils to reconstruct some prehistoric creature for the world to behold
with gratitude that it no longer walks the earth. [[In Helper's case,
the caption]{.mark} for posterity [read]{.mark}: [terrible things await
a nation bent on handing ballots to beasts]{.mark}. "[Seeing]{.mark},
then, that [the negro]{.mark} does, indeed, [belong to a lower and
inferior order of beings]{.mark}, why in the name of Heaven,
[why]{.mark}," [he pleaded with his readers]{.mark}, "[should we forever
degrade and disgrace both ourselves and our posterity by
entering]{.mark}, of our own volition, [into more intimate relations
with him]{.mark}?]{.underline} May God, in his restraining mercy, forbid
that we should ever do this most foul and wicked thing!"3 Helper's
warning failed. Reconstruction proceeded, but not before the seeds of
dread, planted by Helper and many other post- emancipation writers,
spread across the nation like crabgrass in June. When Shaler began
writing about the Negro Problem after federal troops had withdrawn from
the South, after ex-Confederates had returned to power, and after the
nation had set itself on a path of reconciliation, those seeds continued
to produce apprehension about a future fraught with peril. "The forecast
of the unprejudiced observer was exceedingly unfavorable. Every
experiment of freeing blacks on this continent," Shaler wrote with
seeming exasperation, "has in the end resulted in even worse conditions
than slavery brought to them." Haiti and Jamaica were perfect
demonstrations of how blacks' "defects" could wreak havoc on
civilization. Haitians had once belonged to a colonial society of great
"fertile lands" and "great industries of sugar and coffee culture" built
on "mild slavery." But with a corrupt government and a failed economy,
["[the black race \[had\] fallen through its freedom to a state that is
but savagery with a little veneer of Europe and customs]{.mark}." These
were "a people without a single trace of promise except that of
extinction through the diseases of sloth and vice."]{.underline} Jamaica
was just as bad. It had once been a "garden land of the tropics," the
"British of the South," but had now become a land of "barbarism."4
America must take heed, Shaler continued. [[Friends of the race]{.mark}
who had not simply fought for blacks' freedom but also demanded their
"complete enfranchisement as American citizens," who by blind faith and
by declaration tried to "fi t them for a place in the structure of a
self- controlling society," [did not realize that "resolutions cannot
help this rooted nature of man."]{.mark} "[The real dangers that this
African blood brings to our state," Shaler cautioned, lay in "the
peculiarities of nature which belong to the negroes as a race." Unlike
in "our own race]{.mark} inheritance," [black brains stopped developing
sooner, leaving "the negroes" with an animal nature unaltered by the
"fruits of civilization]{.mark}." The results were devastating[: blacks
were incapable of controlling their sexual impulses]{.mark}; [they were
unable to work together f]{.mark}or a common purpose; [and]{.mark}, most
importantly, they had no power to delay gratification and plan for the
future.]{.underline} Despite their "charming nature," their "quick
sensibilities," and their "present Americanized shape," these
"peculiarities" were easily overlooked by those who did not "know the
negro by long and large experience," and who falsely believed that they
were like them. With patience and "the opportunity to search closely
into the nature of this race, they will perceive that the inner man is
really as singular, as different in motives from themselves, as his
outward appearance indicates[." "There can be no doubt," Shaler
proclaimed, "that for centuries to come [the task of weaving these
African threads of life into our society will be]{.mark} [the
greatest]{.mark} of all-American [problem]{.mark}s."5]{.underline}

#### Black bodies become objects in the global marketplace, designated to be commodities for appropriation and labour. This commodification is exemplified when the criminalization of black people is used as justification to trade black bodies to the prison industrial complex. Thus the prison industrial complex isn't isolated to the United States.

[[The **actual bodies** of]{.mark} young [African Americans may also be
commodified]{.mark} as part of a new **black body
politics**]{.underline}. Here, the literature on gender and
globalization, especially the sex industry, is helpful in understanding
how a new black body politics might operate within relations of
consumption. Situating feminist analyses of body politics within
relations of production and consumption that characterize contemporary
globalization provides new avenues for understanding commodification and
the emergence of a new black body politics.4 [For Marx, all workers
under capitalism are **alienated**; they are **objectified** as they
sell their labor power to employers for a wage in order to survive. For
women, especially those in racial/ethnic groups]{.underline} as well as
in industrializing and developing countries alike, [good jobs are more
difficult to find.]{.underline} [Under these circumstances]{.underline},
some women do not sell their bodily labor to produce a commodity.
Instead, [[their bodies become **commodities**]{.mark}.]{.underline} In
a global context, as newly industrializing countries struggle to find
commodity niches in the global economy, they frequently find the best
niches taken. Consequently, [in some countries sex tourism becomes a
significant market fostering national economic development]{.underline}
and international capital accumulation (Wonders and Michalowski, 2001).
[[This]{.mark} new gender [scholarship offers a new]{.mark} [framework
for analyzing a new black body politics that African American youth
confront]{.mark}]{.underline} under conditions of globalization. In the
United States, [African Americans]{.underline} also [find the good jobs
taken and confront a similar issue]{.underline} [of the pressures to
commodify their bodies]{.underline}, especially if those bodies are
young. More importantly, this impetus to commodify black bodies is not
new. [[Chattel slavery]{.underline}]{.mark} in the American South prior
to and during the formation of the American nation state [clearly
[treated]{.mark} the [bodies]{.mark} of people of African descent [as
commodities]{.mark}.]{.underline} Objectifying black bodies enabled
slave traders and slave owners to turn black people's bodies into
commodities. [[Slavers assigned **monetary value** to black]{.mark}
people's [bodies, and then traded black bodies as commodities on the
**open market**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Some scholars on race have taken a
closer look at how the institution of chattel slavery accomplished this
process of objectification, commodification and exploitation. Literary
critic Hortense Spillers suggests that relations of slavery and
colonialism transformed understandings of black people's bodies.
Spillers identifies how ['[captive bodies']{.mark}, namely, the bodies
of **enslaved Africans**, [were severed from their agency]{.mark}, a use
of violence that eliminated gender]{.underline}: 'Their New World,
Diasporic plight marked a theft of the body -- a willful and violent . .
. severing of the captive body from its motive will, its active desire'
(Spillers, 2000: 160). [[This **theft** of the body]{.underline}]{.mark}
severed it from its own agency and thus [[formed the **moment of
objectification**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Spillers suggests that this new
objectified body became a canvas for racist discourse: 'These
indecipherable markings on the captive body render a kind of
hieroglyphics of the flesh whose severe disjunctures come to be hidden
to the cultural seeing by skin color' (Spillers, 2000: 61).
[[Once]{.mark} objectified and **[marked]{.mark}**]{.underline} in this
fashion, [slave owners and [slave traders treated black bodies as
commodities that can be]{.mark} **traded, [bought and sold]{.mark}** on
the open market. The treatment of actual bodies as]{.underline} objects
and subsequently as [commodities within **consumer
markets**]{.underline} as opposed to the appropriation of the labor
power that bodies contain [may be a]{.underline} more [fundamental
element of]{.underline} contemporary [capitalist]{.underline}
[economies]{.underline} than is commonly recognized. French sociological
theorist Colette Guillaumin lays the foundation for a different kind of
historical materialist analysis that rests on body politics (Guillaumin,
1995). Like traditional social class analysis, Guillaumin focuses both
on the economy (the exploitative dimension of appropriation for various
social systems such as slavery and social institutions such as
marriage), and on questions of power and domination. However,
Guillaumin's materialist analysis differs from traditional functionalist
and/or Marxist analyses of stratification/class. In contrast to
traditional social class analyses that begin with the sale of labor
power within capitalist relations, Guillaumin's materialist framework
originates in the appropriation of the body that contains the labor
power itself. Because no form of measuring the value of labor in
isolation from the body itself exists, Guillaumin contends that racism
and sexism both draw upon this physical appropriation of bodies.
[Guillaumin identifies [**slavery** as the fundamental]{.mark}
historical [relationship that fostered modern]{.mark} understandings of
[ideologies of race. Enslaving]{.mark} African bodies [constituted the
**original theft**]{.mark} -- [the stealing of labor came
later.]{.mark}]{.underline} Racial ideologies explaining this process
emerged after slavery was in effect. Guillaumin's theory of the sexual
oppression of women (her analysis of sexage) follows a similar logic.
For Guillaumin, the seizure of women's time, claiming the products of
their bodies such as children, mandating that women use their bodies to
fulfill a sexual obligation, requiring that women's bodies provide
physical care for children, the elderly, the sick as well as healthy
men, all illustrate how men as a class feel that they can appropriate
the bodies of women as a class. Guillaumin points out that [people only
publicly take that which they feel already belongs to them, as is the
case of the public harassment of women in the workplace and on the
street]{.underline}. Guillaumin provides a provocative piece of the
puzzle for constructing an argument concerning the commodification of
the actual bodies as well as representations of the bodies of African
American youth within contemporary global capitalist economies. [New
[forms of]{.mark} [commodification within]{.mark} the constant pressure
to expand [consumer markets **catalyze** a new]{.mark} black [body
politics where]{.mark} social class [relations]{.mark} [rest]{.mark} not
solely on exploiting labor power]{.underline} and/or mystifying
exploitation through images, [but also [on the **appropriation of
bodies** themselves]{.mark}]{.underline}. Whereas young black bodies
were formerly valued for their labor power, under advanced capitalism,
their utility lies elsewhere. Because bodies are not simply raced but
also gendered, [this new black body politics takes **gender-specific**
forms]{.underline}. In particular, beginning in the 1980s, the [[bodies
of]{.mark} young [black men became increasingly]{.mark} [appropriated by
the **prison system**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Typically,
[these]{.underline} alarming [rates of incarceration have been
interpreted as central to new mechanisms of **social
control**]{.underline} (Collins, 2004: 215--46). [[The]{.mark}
discipline]{.underline} [of]{.underline} young African American men that
lands so many in [[prison seems woven into]{.mark} the fabric of
[**everyday life**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Within large [urban areas,
[gangs, ghettoes, public schools]{.mark}, public housing [and prison
work together in a]{.mark} quasi-[**seamless
fashion**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Prisons]{.underline} [and ghettos gain
meaning from one another and both shape]{.underline} [**new racial
formations** within American society]{.underline} (Wacquant, 2001). On
one level, the growth of the punishment industry constitutes an
effective political response to this puzzle of idleness among young
black men as well as an effective mechanism for curtailing their
citizenship rights. If there are no jobs, one can hardly make them go to
them. Racial profiling and locking up men seemed designed to discipline
them into not challenging a system that treated them as throwaways. [The
issue of [felon **disenfranchisement** speaks to this need to discipline
black men]{.mark} through the prison system.]{.underline} In the early
2000s, [[48]{.mark} [states in the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [had
felon disenfranchisement]{.mark} laws.]{.underline} Under felon
disenfranchisement laws, [criminal offenders typically forfeit voting
rights]{.underline} as a collateral consequence of their felony
convictions. These laws appear to be race neutral, yet because young
black men are disproportionately incarcerated, these laws have a
racially disparate impact on this group. In a comprehensive study of
these laws, Behrens and Ugger conclude: our key finding can be
summarized concisely and forcefully: the racial composition of state
prisons is firmly associated with the adoption of state felon
disenfranchisement laws. States with greater nonwhite prison populations
have been more likely to ban convicted felons from voting than states
with proportionately fewer nonwhites in the criminal justice system.
(Behrens and Uggen, 2003: 596) Yet [the growth of [the **punishment
industry**]{.mark} also [illustrates how black male bodies are]{.mark}
objectified, [commodified]{.mark} and incorporated in service [to
maintain]{.mark}ing [prisons as **consumer
markets**.]{.mark}]{.underline} In essence, [[Black]{.mark} men's
commodified [bodies become]{.mark} used as **[raw materials]{.mark}**
for the growing prison industry.]{.underline} It is very simple -- no
prisoners, means no jobs for all of the ancillary industries that
service this growth industry. [Because [prisons]{.mark} express little
interest in rehabilitating prisoners, they [need a steady]{.mark}
[**supply** of bodies.]{.mark} The focus is less on appropriating the
labor]{.underline} of incarcerated black men (although this does happen)
[than in finding profitable uses for their **bodies**]{.underline} while
the state absorbs the costs of incarceration. If Kentucky Fried Chicken
found chickens in short supply, they would close and their profitability
would shrink. [The Kentucky Fried Chicken Corporation]{.underline} has
little interest in extracting labor from its chickens or in coaxing them
to change their ways. Rather, the corporation [needs a constant supply
of cheap, virtually identical chickens to ensure that their business
will remain profitable. In this way, [prisons]{.mark} made [use]{.mark}
of the [bodies of unemployed]{.mark}, unskilled young [black
men,]{.mark} the [virtually indistinguishable]{.mark} young [black men
who populate]{.mark} corners of American [cities]{.mark}.]{.underline}
The vast majority of young black people who are incarcerated by the
punishment industry are male, yet [it is important to remember that
disproportionately high numbers of young **black women** are also
incarcerated and thus are subject to this form of
commodification.]{.underline} Moreover, [young black women may also
encounter an additional bodily commodification of their
sexuality]{.underline}. The majority of sex workers may be female,
obscuring the minority of males who also perform sex work as well as the
objectification and commodification of black male bodies within mass
media as an important component of the sex work industry. [In essence,
[the bodies]{.mark} and images [of]{.mark} young [African Americans
constitute]{.mark} new [commodities that are **central** to
global]{.mark} relations of [consumption]{.mark}]{.underline}, not
marginalized within them.

While I was reading the local newspaper, I came across a story that
caught my attention. [The article was about a seventeen-year-old boy
from Baltimore named [Isaiah Simmons]{.mark} who [died in a juvenile
facility]{.mark} in 2007, when five to [seven counselors suffocated him
while restraining him]{.mark} for hours. When Simmons was unresponsive,
[the counselors dumped his body in the snow and did not call for medical
assistance]{.mark} for more than forty minutes. [In]{.mark} late March
[2012]{.mark}, the [case was thrown out]{.mark}. [None of the
counselors]{.mark} involved in his murder [were charged]{.mark}. [An
article I found online about the case was titled "Charges
Dropped]{.mark} Against 5 [In]{.mark} Juvenile [Offender's
Death]{.mark}."² By [emphasizing]{.mark} [that it was a juvenile
offender who died]{.mark}, the [article]{.mark} immediately [flags
Simmons as a criminal]{.mark}, [signaling]{.mark} to readers [that his
death is]{.mark} inconsequential and thus [not worthy of
sympathy]{.mark}.]{.underline} Every comment posted on the article was
crude and contemptuous. [[The]{.mark} general [sentiment was that his
death was]{.mark} no big [loss to society]{.mark}.]{.underline} The news
about the case being thrown out barely registered at all.³[[There was
no]{.mark} public [outcry]{.mark}, no call to [action]{.mark}, no
[discussion]{.mark} of the myriad issues bound up with Simmons's death:
youth incarceration, racism, the privatization of prisons and jails (he
died at a private facility), medical neglect, state violence, and so
forth.]{.underline} For weeks after reading the article, I contemplated
these questions: What is the difference between Trayvon Martin and
Isaiah Simmons? Which cases galvanize activists into action, and which
are ignored? In the wake of the Jena Six, Troy Davis, Oscar Grant,
Trayvon Martin, and other high-profile cases,⁴ [I have taken note of the
patterns that structure political appeals, particularly the way
[innocence becomes a necessary]{.mark} [precondition for the launching
of mass antiracist political campaigns]{.mark}.]{.underline} These
campaigns often focus on prosecuting and harshly punishing the
individuals responsible for overt and locatable acts of racist violence,
thus positioning the state and the criminal justice system as allies and
protectors of the oppressed. [[When the "innocence" of a black victim is
not established, he or she will not become a suitable spokesperson for
the cause]{.mark}.⁵ An empathetic structure of feeling based on appeals
to innocence has come to ground contemporary antiracist politics.
[Within this framework,]{.mark} [empathy can be established]{.mark} only
[when a person meets]{.mark} the standards of [authentic victimhood and
moral purity,]{.mark} [which requires black people]{.mark}, in the words
of Frank Wilderson, [to be cleansed]{.mark} of
"niggerization."]{.underline} [Social, political, cultural, and legal
recognition happens only when a person is thoroughly whitewashed,
neutralized, [and made unthreatening]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
"spokesperson" activist model, which involves the isolation of cases
considered "exemplary," also tends to emphasize the individual rather
than the collective nature of racist injuries. [Framing oppression in
terms of individual actors is a liberal tactic that dismantles
collective responses to oppression and diverts attention from structural
violence. [Using "innocence" as the foundation to address antiblack
violence is an appeal to the white imaginary]{.mark},]{.underline}
though these arguments are certainly made by people of color as well.
[Re[lying on this framework re-entrenches a logic that criminalizes race
and constructs docile subjects.]{.mark}]{.underline} [A liberal politics
of recognition can only reproduce a guilt-innocence schematization that
fails to grapple with the fact that [there is an a priori association of
blackness with guilt]{.mark} (criminality).]{.underline} Perhaps
association is too generous---there is a flat-out conflation of the
terms. As Wilderson notes in "Gramsci's Black Marx: Whither the Slave in
Civil Society?" [[the cop's answer to the black subject's question---why
did you shoot me?---follows a tautology: "I shot you because you are
Black; you are Black because I shot you.]{.mark}"⁶]{.underline} In the
words of Frantz Fanon, the cause is the consequence.⁷ [Not only are
[black men assumed guilty until proven innocent]{.mark},
[blackness]{.mark} itself [is considered synonymous with
guilt]{.mark}.⁸]{.underline} Authentic victimhood, passivity, moral
purity, and the adoption of a whitewashed position are necessary for
recognition in the eyes of the state. Wilderson, quoting N.W.A., notes
that "a nigga on the warpath" cannot be a proper subject of empathy. [⁹
The [desire for recognition compels political subjects to seek alliance
with the state and to sacrifice themselves in order to meet]{.mark} the
standards of [victimhood]{.mark}. This is also the logic of rape-revenge
narratives: only after a woman is thoroughly degraded can audiences
begin to tolerate her rage]{.underline} (outside of films and books,
violent women are not tolerated even when they have the "moral" grounds
to fight back, as exemplified by the high rates of women who are
imprisoned or sentenced to death for murdering or assaulting abusive
partners). [Although it is sometimes necessary to make "innocence"
appeals for strategic reasons---to win a case or to influence public
opinion---these strategies become problematic when they reinforce a
framework that renders revolutionary and insurgent politics
unimaginable.]{.underline} The prison abolitionist Ruth Wilson Gilmore
notes that "while saving anyone is a good thing to do, to try to assert
innocence as a key political organizing strategy is to turn a blind eye
to the system and how it works."¹⁰ For Gilmore, the problem "is not to
figure out how to determine or prove the innocence of certain
individuals or certain classes of people, but to attack the general
system through which criminalizationproceeds."¹¹These appeals to
innocence are also anachronistic because they do not address the
transformation and reorganization of racist strategies in the
post--civil rights era. [A [politics of innocence is only capable of
acknowledging examples of direct]{.mark}, individualized [acts of racist
violence while obscuring]{.mark} the racism of a putatively color-blind
liberalism that operates on a [structural level]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Posing the issue in terms of personal prejudice feeds the fallacy of
racism as an individual intention, feeling, or personal prejudice,
though there is certainly a psychological and affective dimension of
racism that exceeds the individual in that it is shaped by social norms
and media representations. The liberal color-blind paradigm of racism
submerges race beneath the "commonsense" logic of crime and
punishment.¹² This effectively conceals racism because it is not
considered racist to be against crime. [Such cases as the execution of
Troy Davis---in which the courts come under scrutiny for racial
bias---also legitimize state violence by treating such cases as
exceptional. The political response to the murder of Troy Davis does not
challenge the assumption that communities need to clean up their streets
by rounding up criminals, for it relies on the claim that Davis is not
one of those feared criminals, but an innocent black man.
[Innocence]{.mark}, however, [is often code for nonthreatening to white
civil society]{.mark}. Troy Davis is differentiated from other black
men---the bad ones---and the legal system is diagnosed as being infected
with racism, masking the fact that the legal system is the constituent
mechanism through which racial violence is carried out (wishful
last-minute appeals to the right to a fair trial reveal this, for they
assume that trials are intended to be fair).]{.underline} The state is
imagined to be deviating from its intended role as protector of the
people rather than being the primary perpetrator. H. Rap Brown provides
a sobering reminder that "Justice means 'just-uswhite-folks.' There is
no redress of grievance for Blacks in this country."¹³ [While there are
countless examples of overt racism, [black social]{.mark} (and physical)
[death is primarily achieved via coded discourses of "criminality" and
mediated forms of state violence carried out by an impersonal carceral
apparatu]{.mark}s (a matrix of police, prisons, the legal system,
prosecutors, parole boards, prison guards, probation officers, and so
forth).]{.underline} In other words, incidents where a biased individual
attacks or discriminates against a person of color can be identified as
racism to "conscientious persons," but the racism underlying the
systematic imprisonment of black Americans under the pretense of the War
on Drugs is more difficult to locate and generally remains invisible
because it is spatially confined. When it is visible, it fails to arouse
public sympathy, even among the black leadership. As Loïc Wacquant, a
scholar of the carceral state, asks, "What is the chance that white
Americans will identify with Black convicts when even the Black
leadership has turned its back on them?"¹⁴ The abandonment of black
convicts by civil rights organizations is reflected in the history of
these organizations. From 1975 to 1986, the NAACP and the Urban League
identified imprisonment as a central issue, and the disproportionate
incarceration of black Americans was understood as a problem that was
structural and political. Spokespersons from the civil rights
organizations related imprisonment to the general confinement of black
Americans. Imprisoned black men were, as Wacquant notes, portrayed
inclusively as "brothers, uncles, neighbors, friends."¹⁵ Between 1986
and 1990 there was a dramatic shift in the rhetoric and official policy
of the NAACP and the Urban League that exemplifies the turn to a
politics of innocence. By the early 1990s, the NAACP had dissolved its
prison program and ceased publication of articles about rehabilitation
and post-imprisonment issues. Meanwhile, these organizations began to
embrace the rhetoric of individual responsibility and a tough-on-crime
stance that encouraged blacks to collaborate with police to get drugs
out of their neighborhoods, even going as far as endorsing harsher
sentences for minors and recidivists. Black convicts, initially a part
of the "we" articulated by civil rights groups, became them. Wacquant
writes, "This \[hesitation to advocate for Black convicts\] is further
reinforced by the fact, noted long ago by W. E. B. Du Bois, that the
tenuous position of the black bourgeoisie in the socioracial hierarchy
rests critically on its ability to distance itself from its unruly
lower-class brethren: to offset the symbolic disability of blackness,
middle-class African Americans must forcefully communicate to whites
that they have 'absolutely no sympathy and no known connections with any
black man who has committed a crime.'"¹⁶ When the black leadership and
middle-class blacks differentiate themselves from poorer blacks, they
feed into a notion of black exceptionalism that is used to dismantle
antiracist struggles. This class of exceptional blacks (Barack Obama,
Condoleeza Rice, Colin Powell) supports the image of America as a
post-racial society. The root of this shift in the rhetoric and policy
of civil rights organizations is perhaps a fear of affirming the
conflation of blackness and criminality. However, by not advocating for
prisoners, they shore up and extend the penal state by individualizing,
depoliticizing, and decontextualizing the issue of "crime and
punishment" and vilifying those most likely to be subjected to
racialized state violence. [This [disidentification]{.mark} with poor,
urban black Americans is not limited to black men, but [also affects
black women, who are vilified via the figure of the Welfare
Queen]{.mark}, [portrayed as a lazy, sexually irresponsible burden on
society (]{.mark}particularly hardworking white Americans).]{.underline}
The welfare state and the penal state complement each other, as revealed
by Bill Clinton's 1998 statements denouncing prisoners and ex-prisoners
who receive welfare or Social Security: he condemns former prisoners who
receive welfare assistance, accusing them of deviously committing "fraud
and abuse" against "working families" who "play by the rules."¹⁷
Furthermore, this complementarity is gendered. Black women are the shock
absorbers of the social crisis created by the penal state[: the
[incarceration of black men]{.mark} profoundly [increases the burden put
on black women]{.mark}, who are forced to perform more waged and unwaged
(caring) labor, raise children alone, and who are punished by the state
when their husbands or family members are convicted of crimes (for
example, [a family cannot receive housing assistance if someone in the
household has been convicted of a drug felony]{.mark}).]{.underline} The
reconfiguration of the welfare state under the Clinton administration
(which imposed stricter regulations on welfare recipients) further
intensified the backlash against poor black women. In this view, the
welfare state is the apparatus used to regulate poor black women who are
not subjected to regulation by the penal state that is directed chiefly
at black men---though it is important to note [that the feminization of
poverty and the punitive turn in nonviolent crime policy led to a 400
percent increase in the female prison population]{.underline} between
1980 and the late 1990s.¹⁸Racialized patterns of incarceration and the
assault on the urban poor are not seen as a form of racist state
violence because, in the eyes of the public, convicts (along with their
families and associates) deserve such treatment. [The politics of
innocence directly fosters this culture of vilification, even when it is
used by civil rights]{.underline}

#### **Blackness is a preconceived notion of danger; whiteness sees violence rather than resistance and fails to see that its rather the system built in opposition to black bodies. The 1AC is an embodiment of the negation of a politics of innocence which departs from enabling white civil society to purify and morally ennoble itself.**

[The [insistence on innocence results in a refusal to hear those labeled
guilty]{.mark} or defined by the state [as "criminals."]{.mark} [When we
rely on appeals to innocence]{.mark}, [we foreclose a form of resistance
that is outside the limits of law and instead ally ourselves with the
state]{.mark}. This ignores that the "enemies" in the War on Drugs and
the War on Terror are racially defined, and that gender and class
delimit who is worthy of legal recognition. [When the Occupy movement
was in full swing]{.mark}, I read countless articles and encountered
participants who were eager to police the politics and tactics of those
who did not fit into a nonviolent model of resistance.]{.underline} The
tendency was to construct a politics from the position of the
disenfranchised white middle-class and to remove, deny, and
differentiate the Occupy movement from the "delinquent" or radical
elements by condemning property destruction, confrontations with cops,
and---in cases like Baltimore--- anticapitalist and anarchist analyses.
[When [Amy Goodman asked Maria Lewis from Occupy Oakland about the
"violent" protestors]{.mark} after more than four hundred arrests made
during an attempt to occupy the vacant Henry J. Kaiser Convention Center
in Oakland, I was pleased that Lewis affirmed rather than excised
people's anger]{.underline}: AMY GOODMAN: Maria Lewis, what about some
of the reports that said that the protesters were violent? MARIA LEWIS[:
Absolutely[. There was a lot of anger this weekend]{.mark}, and I think
that the anger the protesters showed in the streets this weekend and the
fighting back that did take place was reflective of a larger anger in
Oakland that is boiling over at the betrayal of the system. I think that
[people]{.mark}, day by day, [are realizing]{.mark}, [as the economy
gets worse and worse]{.mark}, as [unemployment gets worse]{.mark} and
worse, as [homelessness gets worse]{.mark} and worse, that the economic
system, that capitalism in Oakland, is failing us]{.underline}. And
people are really angry about that, and they're beginning to fight back.
And I think that's a really inspiring thing.⁵⁷ Although the comment
still frames the issue in terms of capitalist crisis, the response
skillfully rearticulates the terms of the discussion by [a) [affirming
the actions immediately]{.mark}, b) [refusing to purify the
movement]{.mark} by integrating rather than excluding the "violent"⁵⁸
elements, c) [legitimizing the anger and desires]{.mark} of the
protestors, and d) [shifting the attention to the structural nature of
the problem rather than making moral judgments about individual
actors]{.mark}.]{.underline} In other words, [it rejects a politics of
innocence that reproduces the "good," compliant citizen.]{.underline}
Stokely Carmichael put it well when he said, ["The way the oppressor
tries to stop the oppressed from using violence as a means to attain
liberation is to raise ethical or moral questions about violence. I want
to state emphatically here that violence in any society is neither moral
nor is it ethical. It is neither right, nor is it wrong. It is just
simply a question of who has the power to legalize
violence."⁵⁹]{.underline} The practice of isolating morally agreeable
cases in order to highlight racist violence requires passively suffered
black death and panders to a framework that strengthens and conceals
current paradigms of racism. Although it may be factually true to state
that Trayvon Martin was unarmed, we should not state this with a
righteous sense of satisfaction. What if Martin were armed? What if he
was able to defend himself? Had the situation resulted in the death of
George Zimmerman rather than of Martin, it is unlikely that the public
would have been as outraged and galvanized into action to the same
extent. Prior to Zimmerman's acquittal, many people on the left had
faith that there would be "justice for Trayvon," as though prison time
for Zimmerman could somehow compensate for Martin's death. When we build
politics around standards of legitimate victimhood that require passive
sacrifice, we will build a politics that requires a dead black boy to
make its point. It's not surprising that the nation or even the black
leadership have failed to rally behind CeCe McDonald, [a [black trans
woman]{.mark} who [was convicted of second-degree manslaughter after a
group of racist, transphobic white people attacked her]{.mark} and her
friends, cutting McDonald's [cheek with a glass bottle]{.mark} and
provoking an altercation that [led to the death of a white man who had a
swastika tattoo]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Trans women of color]{.mark} who
are involved in confrontations that result in the death of their
attackers [are criminalized for their survival.]{.mark} When [Akira
Jackson]{.mark}, a black trans woman, [stabbed and killed her boyfriend
after he beat her]{.mark} with a baseball bat, she [was given a
four-year sentence]{.mark} for manslaughter. [Cases that involve an
"innocent" (passive), victimized black person also provide an
opportunity for the liberal white conscience to purify and morally
ennoble itself by taking a position against racism]{.mark}. [We need to
challenge the use of certain raced and gendered subjects as instruments
of emotional relief for white civil society]{.mark}, or as bodies that
can be displaced for the sake of providing analogies to amplify white
suffering ("slavery" being the favored analogy).]{.underline} Although
we must emphasize that Troy Davis did not kill police officer Mark
MacPhail, [maybe we also should question [why the public is morally
outraged by the killing of a cop and not the 136 unarmed black Americans
murdered by police officers, security guards, and self-appointed
vigilantes in 2012]{.mark} alone]{.underline}. Talking about these
murders will not undo them. Having the "right line" cannot alter reality
if we do not put our bodies where our mouths are. As Spivak says, "it
can't become our goal to keep watching our language."⁶⁰[[Rejecting the

also suggest that the black weapon prefigures the suicide bomber, which
preoccupies contemporary analysis of necropolitics. But martyrdom is
absent from such an analysis because [[the black weapon is pure use
value.]{.underline}]{.mark} The weapon does not sacrifice itself;
[[**destruction** is its reason for existence]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Black weapons also lack any relationality between humans and a political
community from which to ground such self-sacrifice. Black death,
vulnerability, injury, and destruction are mere comedic by-products of a
war between humans. In the image, soldiers easily affix cannons to black
bodies and position these weapons in the line of fire. The battlefield
is precisely the space of emancipation --- a death-scape. And the being
emancipation creates in this space is the black weapon. [**War**
allegorizes the metaphysical holocaust, which places black being in
extraordinary harm]{.underline} without regard to any ontological ground
of resistance. [This war]{.underline}, unlike the Civil War, [is
**without end**. [The **black weapon** is]{.mark} being for another
[within an economy of brutality, **strategy**, and
calculation]{.mark}.]{.underline} This catachrestic fantasy realizes the
terror Heidegger envisioned with his critique of technological
reasoning. The complete collapse between technology and flesh could only
be realized with black being, and the image articulates this
understanding.33 It is unthinkable that the union soldiers would become
weapons because they are human beings. Thus, it is not just that the
image is viciously satirical, but also that the image exposes a kernel
of truth: [[it]{.mark} is indeed plausible that black being could be
used in such a way in an antiblack world.]{.underline} Humor encases a
metaphysical truth. [Black being lacks ontological security and [is
**malleable** in the hands of humans. This is **ontological
terror**.]{.mark}]{.underline} We might also revisit the Lacanian terms
enjoyment and interpassivity --- for it seems that both are operative in
the catachrestic fantasy[. The cynosure of [the image is a black
weapon]{.mark} with a minstrel-like smile]{.underline} (a smile that
indicates utter obsequiousness to vicious demands and unawareness of
immediate danger), [gladly [sitting]{.mark} on the ground [to facilitate
the **soldier's reloading**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The smile is a
signifier of stupid enjoyment, a masochistic embrace of destruction.
Through the smile, the black weapon is aligned with the nothing and all
the terror it entails. The smile, then, is the figuration of
interpassivity and enjoyment. [[The **terror** of nothing is projected
onto]{.mark} black bodies ([black weapons]{.mark} must hold the
**destructive** enjoyment for the white subject, standing as a
substitutional receptacle for the human's enjoyment),]{.underline} and
the enjoyment is vicious --- it is the enjoyment of continual
destruction (the metaphysical holocaust).34 The smile also dockets a
certain duty or obligation of black being --- to rejoice in destruction
as service (in this way, service as black suicide is inconceivable for
the illustrator; only honor and duty explain the stupid enjoyment. The
illustrators, then, impose a fallacious agency on the weapon, which is
part of the vicious humor, since a weapon has no choice in the
matter/manner of its destruction). And we might say the smile signals
"arbitrary \[black\] death as a legitimate feature of a system," as
Lewis Gordon poignantly notes.35 The arbitrariness of black perishment
exposes its meaningless enjoyment through the loss of meaning.36 [[The
metaphysical world is a **battlefield** for blacks, blacks
**reconfigured** as weapons for a war without end.]{.mark} At any
moment, at any time, blacks could perish]{.underline} --- or, to retool
Heidegger, this perishment occurs in einem Augenblick (in a blink of an
eye, or immediately). Again, I am using the term perishment over
Gordon's death to docket the utter lack of meaning and being black
destruction entails. [Thus, there can never be Ereignis for black
weapons, no event in which death enables an authentic embrace of being.
Heideggerian death is impossible for black being. [There is only death
as]{.mark} **perishment** --- meaningless, arbitrary, and [**eventless**
destruction]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The smile is the internecine
sign of this destruction. The smile, then, is absolutely essential to
the image (its punctum, to borrow Barthes's term).37 The smile gets us
to the essence of the image. What the black weapon is smiling at is
nothing. This, ultimately, is the fantasy the illustrator presents, and
it serves to disavow the brutal context within which the weapon is
placed. For the illustrator, blacks embrace the terroristic nothing
antiblackness imposes upon it. Imposition is recast as masochistic
embrace. The image stages an encounter with nothing as a dutiful embrace
of onticide. [[The black body is **finished**.]{.mark} The image
articulates the closure of metaphysics: the [black]{.mark} body [is
nothing more than an antiblack invention, an **instrument** of a
destructive]{.mark} will to [power]{.mark}]{.underline}. Any agency we
imagine we can extract from this body by reclaiming and celebrating it
has evaporated in a toxic atmosphere. [By closure, however, I do not
mean the end (as is the fantasy of some postmetaphysicians) but the
**completion** of its internecine aim concerning black being. [The
aim]{.mark}, the metaphysical enterprise, [is to **sever** the flesh
from the body through]{.mark} the work of [violence, **degradation**,
and terror, such that what is left is not a human body, but a]{.mark}
body as **[machine]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This is what the image
proudly proclaims. The image, then, can be read as an antiblack
celebration, a triumph over black being (and the intransigent remainder
of the flesh). In his brilliant essay "The Black Body as Fetish,"
Anthony Farley argues that [[the black body]{.mark} serves as the object
of white fantasy; the body [is pressed into narratives of]{.mark}
savagery and **[degradation]{.mark}** to maintain white mastery and
racial innocence.]{.underline} Taking something like Žižek's advice,
"Enjoy your symptom," seriously,38 Farley suggests that a masochistic
embrace of the function of the black body in antiblack fantasy produces
pleasure (or jouissance):

Complementing the traditional focus on production with greater attention
to [the growing significance of **consumption** within [global
**capitalism** provides new]{.mark} [directions for
understanding]{.mark} the experiences of [African American
youth]{.mark}.]{.underline} Black American youth are far from
marginalized [[within]{.underline} [a]{.underline}]{.mark} [massive
[global black]{.mark} [culture industry that uses their images to
**sell**]{.mark} a wide array of products]{.underline}. Moreover, [black
American youth]{.underline} also [constitute a **consumer
market**]{.underline} of their own [who will purchase music, alcohol,
drugs, cell phones]{.underline}, gym shoes, their own images [and other
products that are **created** **specifically** for them. [African
American youth are]{.mark}]{.underline} not marginalized but rather
remain [essential to new [consumer markets, both as
**suppliers**]{.mark}]{.underline} of commodities that are bought and
sold, [[and]{.mark} as reliable [consumer]{.mark} markets.]{.underline}
[African American youth are a **hot commodity** in the]{.underline}
contemporary [global]{.underline} [marketplace]{.underline} and global
media. [[Their images have **catalyzed** new]{.mark} consumer [markets
for products and services]{.mark}.]{.underline} The music of [[hip hop
culture, for example]{.underline}]{.mark}, follows its rhythm and blues
predecessor as a so-called crossover genre that is very popular with
whites and other cultural groups across the globe. [[**Circulated**
through film, television, and music]{.mark}, **news and advertising**,
[mass media]{.mark} constructs and [sells]{.mark} a [**commodified**
black culture]{.mark} from ideas about class, gender and
age.]{.underline} [Through]{.underline} a wide array of [genres ranging
from talk shows to feature length films]{.underline}, television
situation comedies to CDs, video rentals to cable television, [the
images produced and **circulated** within this area all aim [to
**entertain**]{.mark}]{.underline} and amuse [[a]{.underline}]{.mark}
highly segmented [consumer]{.underline} [[market]{.underline}]{.mark}.
This market is increasingly global and subject to the contradictions of
global marketplace phenomena.2 One implication of the significance of
consumption for understanding social class relations of black youth
concerns the constant need to stimulate consumer markets. [Contemporary
[capitalism relies]{.mark}]{.underline} not just
[[on]{.underline}]{.mark} cutting the costs attached to production, but
also on [[**stimulating** consumer demand]{.mark}.]{.underline} Just as
sustaining relations of production requires a steady supply of people to
do the work, sustaining relations of consumption needs ever-expanding
consumer markets. Moreover, [just as people do not naturally work and
must be encouraged or compelled to do so, [people do not engage in
excess consumption without **prompting**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this
context, [[advertising constitutes an important site that
**creates**]{.underline} [**demand** for
commodities]{.underline}]{.mark} [of all sorts.]{.underline} Marketing
and advertising often create demand for things that formerly were not
seen as commodities, for example, the rapid growth of the bottled water
industry, as well as for intangible entities that seem difficult to
commodify. In this regard, [[the]{.mark} rapid [growth of mass
media]{.mark} and new informational **technologies** [has
catalyzed]{.mark} a [**demand** for black culture as a
commodity]{.mark}.]{.underline} As the black culture industry
recognizes, most [market demand]{.underline} for products and services
[stems not from needs but]{.underline} rather from [unmet desires that
must be constantly stimulated.]{.underline} In this context, physical
addictions create ideal consumers who are willing to assume debt to pay
for their addictions. If consumers become addicted to tobacco, alcohol,
drugs or similar products, despite health risks, they can be counted on
to consume. As the repetitive behavior of shopping addicts suggests,
[the ideal consumer is]{.underline} one who is [addicted to
**consumption itself**]{.underline}, never mind the actual product or
service consumed. In this context, [[the interconnections among the
marketing of black culture, addictive behavior]{.mark} of consumers who
buy its products, [and]{.mark} any [consumer debt]{.mark} that ensues
[are **tightly linked**]{.mark}]{.underline}.3 Under this ever-expanding
impetus to create new consumer markets, [[nothing is exempt from]{.mark}
commodification and [**sale**, including the pain that African American
youth experience]{.mark} with **poverty and
powerlessness**.]{.underline} Nowhere is this more evident than in the
contradictions of rap. As Cornel West points out,'the irony in our
present moment is that just as young black men are murdered, maimed and
imprisoned in record numbers, their styles have become
disproportionately influential in shaping popular culture' (West, 1993).
In this context, [[rap becomes the only place where black youth
have]{.mark} public [voice, yet it is]{.mark} a public voice that is
**[commodified]{.mark}** and contained [by what]{.mark} hip hop
[producers think will sell.]{.mark}]{.underline} Despite these
marketplace limitations, rap remains a potential site of contestation, a
place where African American youth can rebel against the police
brutality, lack of jobs, and other social issues that confront them
(Kelley, 1994). Thus, [work on the black culture industry illustrates
how images of black culture function to catalyze
consumption.]{.underline}

#### **Stereotyped images of "authentic" Blackness over-codes Black identity into categories classified by what will sell in the marketplace of global racial capitalism. Black pimps, prostitutes, and rappers [define]{.underline} the nature of this system---wherein Blackness is put up for sale on an [auction block]{.underline} and sold to the [highest bidder]{.underline}.**

[[Black male involvement in the sex work industry
may]{.underline}]{.mark} not [[involve]{.underline}]{.mark} the direct
exploitation of black men's bodies as much as [[the]{.mark}
objectification and [commodification of sexualized black male images
within **hip hop** culture]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [The
prevalence of **representations** of black men as pimps speaks to this
image of black men as sexual hustlers who use their sexual prowess to
**exploit** women]{.underline}, both black and white. Ushered in by a
series of films in the 'Blaxploitation' era, the ubiquitous black pimp
seems here to stay. Kept alive through HBO produced quasi-documentaries
such as [Pimps Up, Hos Down, African American men feature prominently in
**mass media**]{.underline}. Despite these media constructions, actual
pimps see themselves more as businessmen than as sexual predators. For
example, the men interviewed in the documentary American Pimp all
discuss the skills involved in being a successful pimp. One went so far
as to claim that only African American men made really good pimps. Thus,
the controlling image of the black pimp combines all of elements of the
more generic hustler, namely, engaging in illegal activity, using women
for economic gain, and refusing to work. [[Representations of black
women and men as **prostitutes** and **pimps** **permeate** music
videos, film and television.]{.mark} In]{.underline} the context of a
powerful [global mass media, black men's bodies are **increasingly
objectified** within popular culture]{.underline} [in ways that resemble
the treatment of all women. [Violence and sexuality **sell**,]{.mark}
and associating [black men]{.mark} with both [is]{.mark}]{.underline}
virtually [[sure to please]{.underline}]{.mark}. Yet [the real struggle
is]{.underline} less [about]{.underline} the content of black male and
black female images and more about [the treatment of black people's
bodies as **valuable** **commodities** within advertising and
entertainment.]{.underline} [[Because this new constellation of images
participates in **commodified global capitalism**]{.underline}]{.mark},
in all cases, [[representations of black]{.mark} people's [bodies are
tied to]{.mark} structures of **[profitability]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Athletes and criminals alike are profitable, not for the vast majority
of African American men, but for the [[people]{.underline}]{.mark} who
own the teams, control the media, provide food, clothing and telephone
services to the prisons, and who **[[consume]{.underline}]{.mark}**
seemingly [[**endless** images of pimps, hustlers,]{.mark} rapists, [and
felons]{.mark}]{.underline}. What is different, however, is how [[these
images]{.mark} of authentic blackness [generate]{.mark} additional
**[consumer markets]{.mark}**]{.underline} beyond the selling of these
specific examples of cultural production. [Recognizing the value of
commodified **black culture**, many African American [rap stars]{.mark}
have [start]{.mark}ed [their own]{.mark} record labels, clothing
[companies]{.mark}, and more recently, sports drink
divisions]{.underline}. [Their desire lies in sharing the **profits** of
a huge global consumer market of]{.underline} youth who purchase the rap
CDs, sports drinks, gym shoes, and clothing lines of [hip hop
culture]{.underline}. Take, for example, [the 2003 release of [Pimp
Juice, a]{.mark} new [sports beverage]{.mark}]{.underline} that was
lauded by Vibe magazine as the best energy drink. Despite Pimp Juice's
claims that it provides vitamins and that its 10 percent apple juice
content makes it healthy, [the yellow and white design of its can
[resembles beer cans.]{.mark}]{.underline} Initially, [Pimp Juice was
[**marketed** within African American
neighborhoods]{.mark}]{.underline}, yet by 2004 Pimp Juice was
disseminated by 60 distributors in the United States, in 32 states and
in 81 markets. According to [[its]{.underline}]{.mark} distributor,
because [Pimp Juice is [flying off the shelves]{.mark} in the UK, the
Caribbean Islands, and Mexico]{.underline}, the distributor aims to sell
the product in Australia, Japan, China and Israel. The irony of this
particular product is that [[Nelly]{.mark}, the rap star whose [song
titled 'Pimp Juice']{.mark} helped resurrect the **popularity** of the
concept of the pimp]{.underline}, also owns the company that distributes
Pimp Juice. [This one product [illustrates the]{.mark} increasingly
[seamless relations among]{.mark} the [commodification of **black
images**]{.mark} (pimp/prostitute), [struggles between
**corporations**]{.mark} and hip hop capitalists (rap star Nelly) in
search of new consumer markets, [the expansion of new]{.mark} consumer
[markets]{.mark} (how Pimp Juice is marketed to black consumers),
[and]{.mark} potentially [new systems of **control** within]{.mark}
African American civil [society]{.mark} that grow from the same
conditions that sparked changes within Nigerian society]{.underline}.
Beverage makers claim that pimp juice is a benign sports drink --
www.letitloose.com, Pimp Juice's official web site describe it as a
'healthy, non-carbonated energy drink possessing a tropical berry
flavor' -- yet when Black American youth buy pimp juice at their corner
store, they most likely are singing the lyrics Nelly's song 'Pimp Juice'
while they pay \$1.89 for one can of actual 'Pimp Juice'. The lyrics of
Nelly's song 'Pimp Juice' make it clear what pimp juice really is and
who it is for. Nelly opens his song by boasting that because his woman
only wants him for his 'pimp juice', he needs to 'cut her loose'. He
then moves on to describe the power seats, leather and sunroof of his
pimpmobile. When 'hoes see it', according to Nelly, they 'can't believe
it'. Nelly knows their game and puts them out, telling them to dust
their shoes off so as not to touch his rug. For those who still don't
get it, Nelly ends his song with a rousing definition of pimp juice:
'your pimp juice is anything, attract the opposite sex, it could be
money, fame, or straight intellect'. Always an equal-opportunity kind of
guy, [Nelly proclaims, 'bitches got the pimp juice too, come to think
about it dirty, they got more than we do'. By itself, the song 'Pimp
Juice' is just a song. Yet when coupled with [the music video of]{.mark}
Nelly representing a pimp and **mass marketing campaigns** that [put
cans of]{.mark} actual [Pimp Juice in corner stores]{.mark} for young
African Americans to see and buy, [the circle is
**complete**]{.mark}]{.underline}. African American youths' encounters
with Pimp Juice comprise the case examined here, yet [the new
commodities and new consumer markets in this example point to much
**larger issues**. [The hip hop capitalism of Nelly's]{.mark} brilliant
[marketing]{.mark} of 'Pimp Juice' [illustrates how sexualized
understandings of black]{.mark} women's and men's [bodies and culture
become]{.mark} marketed and [**put up for sale** **in the global
marketplace**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It also focuses on new consumers of
bodies and images, in particular, how [[black people become target
audiences for their **own degradation**]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g. the
case of pimp juice) as well as Nelly's plans to go global with this
popular product. When it comes to the commodification of black bodies,
few African Americans celebrate the criminal justice system. At the same
time, [when it comes to the commodification of images associated with
prison culture as well as an array of **products** that seemingly signal
a seemingly authentic black culture, blacks are well represented among
the consumers of these images.]{.underline}

#### Thus, we some people of the United States of America do ordain and establish that all sales of Blackness from the United States should cease. 

#### Observation 2 is re-taking yourself.

#### We use a praxis of fabulation to redefine the commodified Black image and retake the Black imagination within the confines of racial capital. That [opens up]{.underline} spaces of [freedom]{.underline} and picks up the tools to [hack]{.underline} against Whiteness. It's an insurgent movement to [break down]{.underline} antiblackness and [inspire]{.underline} [resistance]{.underline}.

How might we begin to make sense of the paradoxical vibrance of a form
of life endangered, or even erased, by efforts at documentation and
representation? What do we do with feelings that resist retrospective
vindication? In this book, I am interested in answering such questions
through a critical and fabulative archiving of a world that was \"never
meant to survive,\" as Audre Lorde memorably put it---and a world that,
I would add, was perhaps also never meant to appear.3 [The persistent
reappearance of that which was never meant to appear, but was instead
meant to be kept outside or below representation forms the first sense
in which this book will mobilize the term
\"afro-fabulation.\"]{.underline} I don\'t mean by this that the
fabulist is a storyteller in any straightforward sense of that familiar
term, still less that she is a liar. More nearly, [[fabulation engages
the]{.mark} philosophical [position]{.mark}, identified by Henri Bergson
among other modern theorists, that the irreversibility [of the flow of
time is the]{.mark} paradoxical [source of freedom]{.mark}]{.underline}.
4 [[Fabulation points to]{.mark} the deconstructive relation between
story and plot]{.underline}, a topic more frequently studied in
literature than, as I shall attempt here, in relation to visual and
perfor- mance art. When LaBeija abjures and, in the next breath,
solicits the recording apparatus of the camera, she enacts this paradox
of fabula- tion vividly. When we consider our own transgression of her
interdic- tion of that gaze, we can see that [blackness grasps us even
as we seek to grasp it.]{.underline} In the chapters that follow, I
track key moments of fabulation in contemporary black art and
performance, honing in on moments in which [[black subversions
of]{.mark} sexual and gender [conformity]{.mark} prove excessive,
disorderly, or simply unintelligible to an external gaze.]{.underline}
Contesting a historical and political sequence that is by now
familiar---a sequence in which gay rights follows upon civil rights in
progressive lock-step, and the queer theory of the 1990s builds upon the
feminist, black, and anti- colonial writings of the 1960s and 1970s---[I
instead look to the ways the study of [blackness can rearrange our
perceptions of]{.mark} chronology, [time]{.mark}, and temporality. My
aim is to speculate on the manner in which the \"changing same\" of
black aesthetics and expressivity may have always 5 already been queer.
Performing for and against the Camera Acts of
[afro-fabulation]{.mark}]{.underline} such as LaBeija\'s epic read, I
will argue in this book, [[operate as a]{.mark} queer [hack]{.mark} [of
the]{.mark} codes of an [anti-black world]{.mark}, and rely for their
success on a vernacular awareness of, and confrontation with, the manner
in which gender and sexual norms operate to repro- duce systems of
racial hierarchy.]{.underline} While critical analysis and traditions of
protest have cultivated theoretical and methodological priorities among
race, gender, sexuality, and class, at the intersection where LaBeija
engages the camera (and, through it, the entire cinematic apparatus of
capture), [[the]{.mark} black [fabulative subject must]{.mark} [perform
with her whole self]{.mark}, albeit a self iterated to another
power]{.underline}. 6 Recognizing the mythmaking function of the camera
to speak to what Gilles Deleuze terms a \"people who are missing,\"
[LaBeija races against time to preserve and, in fact, to invent the
splendor of her competitive performance]{.underline}.7 [[Knowing how the
rules]{.mark} and codes [are stacked against them]{.mark}, competitive
[black subjects]{.mark} like LaBeija [perfect]{.mark} the skill of [back
chat]{.mark}, shade, reading, [and other hacks of the color]{.mark}
[line, which]{.mark}, when they work successfully, [reveal]{.mark} the
beauty of a terrible (and to some, terrifying)
[joy]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The terrible joy of LaBeija\'s queer
performance, which throws shade and color upon a whitewashed pageant, is
not shuckin\' or jivin\', but their opposite]{.underline}. Bound to
appear, [[she takes]{.mark} [refuge in]{.mark} a [performative
agency]{.mark}]{.underline} that is derived specifically from the
multiplicity of her sisters, both sisters present with her and those who
stayed home. 8 She addresses us, here in the future, without being able
to know how she has changed us. [This book\'s account of
[afro-fabulation is]{.mark} thus before anything else [a theory]{.mark}
of the event.]{.underline} There are of course many theories of the
event, and also, as we shall see, theories of the \"nonevent.\" 9 In
most respects the incident captured on camera would almost assuredly be
termed a nonevent. A belated and ineffective protest, it is shut down
within the narrative logic of the film itself.10 And either a win or a
loss at a drag ball that is itself in breach of the law against
cross-dressing can hardly be as- similated to any grand narrative of
history. [Rather than looking to this moment of performing for and
against the camera as a decisive act of agency, then, [I look]{.mark}
instead [to]{.mark} theories of [the ordinary]{.mark} and the everyday
[as]{.mark} the texture out of which the eventfulness of [fabulation
arises]{.mark}]{.underline}. If one of the most common assertions of
performance studies is that [performance is everywhere, Afro-Fabulations
looks to that nondescript character, that quality of in media res, and
attends especially to those moments and lo- cations where a change in
the surround that is blackness seems to come out of
nowhere.]{.underline} My claim in this book is that [afro-fabulation is
a theory and practice of black time and temporality]{.underline}, and
the following pages lay out the scope of this claim as it pertains to
both the study of performance and the theory of performativity. [Both
art and literature are impacted by [afro-fabulation as
trans-disciplinary]{.mark} study. Cutting across disciplinary ap-
proaches affords me a method of doing work that apprehends the black
artist in a range of media. Within the contemporary social and politi-
cal movements to which my own scholarly labors are indebted, such
breadth [seeks to work against being disciplined by the academy]{.mark}
through a scholarly protocol of divide and conquer]{.underline}. A
second danger, which I also consider, is the risk of communicating and
rendering overly explicit that which ought more tactically remain
camouflaged. In order better to apprehend the general antagonism within
the specific contradiction of our present conjuncture, then, I outline
these preliminary remarks by way of [afro-fabulation as a
trans-disciplinary method]{.underline}. Although I am interested in the
everydayness of black performance, one ordinary and commonsense usage of
\"fabulation\" must be clarified at the outset. [A fabulist in my
parlance is nothing like a liar]{.underline}. More nearly, [fabulation
exposes the relation between truth and lying in an other-than- moral
sense]{.underline}, to paraphrase Nietzsche. My interest in
fabulationality---[the entangled and angular socialities generated by
fabulation]{.underline}---is of course also inspired by the \"poetics of
relation\" pioneered by Edouard Glissant. 11 [[It exposes the difference
in every repetition]{.underline}]{.mark}, as exemplified by a writer
like Gayl Jones, in particular in her novel Mosquito, in which her gar-
rulous narrator promises to distinguish between \"communicating\" and
\"camouflage.\" 12 Incredibly detailed and specific one minute, the
narrator of this epic novel of the American Southwest turns reticent and
guarded the next. She is not an \"untrustworthy\" narrator, however. Her
reticence commands respect and produces trust. [When she
\"confabulates,\" she ad- mits she may be confused on a point or two.
But these [points of incoherence in her]{.mark} subjective
[memory]{.mark} are not a sign of dissemblance; they [are]{.mark},
instead, [sites of]{.mark} what I will describe as
[incompossibility]{.mark}]{.underline}. We see
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} the sanctuary work Jones\'s protagonist
engages in tethers together worlds that can and cannot be, and
[[is]{.mark} thus [a necessary]{.mark} [step toward investigating
possibilities outside our present]{.mark} terms of [order]{.mark}. This
is an incompossibility]{.underline}, rather than a contradiction, and
her slogan might be: \"Another world is incompossible.\"
Afro-fabulation, in Jones, is thus also en route toward the \"critical
fabulation\" that black feminist historian Saidiya Hartman has proposed,
and gestures to the \"speculative fabulation\" proposed by 13 feminist
science theorist Donna Haraway. [[Such]{.mark} black feminist and
posthumanist [acts of speculation]{.mark} are never simply a matter of
inventing tall tales from whole cloth. More nearly, they [are]{.mark}
the [tactical fictionalizing]{.mark} of a world that is, from the point
of view of black social life, already false. It is [an insurgent
movement---in the face of]{.mark} an intransigent and ever-mutating
[anti-blackness---toward]{.mark} something else, something other,
[something more]{.mark}]{.underline}. While moments of afro-fabulation
are indeed often ephemeral and fleeting---as with La- Beija\'s
performance---they may also be as monumental and enduring as Jones\'s
novels. Though neither may transform the conditions under which they
appear, t[hey live on through performative and narrative strategies and
[tactics that draw out]{.mark} of a black feminist and queer reposi-
tory of counter-conduct, finding in collective memory an ever-renewing
[series of stratagems for]{.mark} aesthetic
[oppositionality]{.mark}.]{.underline}14 The work of Saidiya Hartman in
[imagining and enacting [\"critical fabulation\"]{.mark} is crucial here
because of the way it [throws into crisis the progressive
teleology]{.mark} from bondage to freedom, [and]{.mark} thus [calls upon
us to examine]{.mark} more carefully [the afterlives of
slavery]{.mark}]{.underline}.15 The short essay \"Venus in Two Acts,\"
in which Hartman outlines a series of questions leading toward a
critical speculative poetics of fabulation, has been a touchstone for my
thinking, even as I look to a seemingly different set of archives and
questions. How might critical fabulation, I ask, be brought to bear in
these other contexts? In particular, I seek in these chapters to take a
set of questions that emerged at the nexus of history and literary stud-
ies and bring them to bear upon performance, cinema, art, music, and
digital technology. Chapter 2, for instance, is grounded in traditional
questions of archival recovery, whereas chapter 4 looks to the mnemonic
and memorializing function of performance and public art, and chap- ter
8 turns our focus on techno-scientific projects aiming to escape the
all-consuming racial past. [Afro-fabulation as I intend it here demands
interdisciplinary modes of investigation]{.underline}. Put another way,
[the phenomena of fabulation that I pursue here--- across a range of
aesthetic instances---is tethered to the classic paradox of fiction: the
matter of why and how it is [that a story we know to be untrue
can]{.mark} nonetheless [inspire belief]{.mark}, emotion, and
attachment.]{.underline} 16 Fictions, a theory of fabulation can tell
us, do not simply attach themselves to moments of idle fantasy, play,
instruction, or other socially acceptable occasions for storytelling.
[Fictions instead arise out of the indeterminacy and flux of living and
dying, with life being perhaps the greatest fiction of all.]{.underline}
\"[There is fiction in the space between]{.underline},\" Tracy Chapman
17 sings, \"the lines of your page of memories. If the paradox of
fiction threatens to untether both history and memory fro ds of
veridiction, [[these powers of the false are]{.mark} not so much to be
enthusiastically embraced as they are [to be]{.mark} [critically
interrogated]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Black]{.underline}]{.mark} [art and
[performance can aid this]{.mark} process of critical fabulation in a
variety of ways]{.underline} I will explore over the course of this
book, but especially [insofar [as they bring]{.mark} into co-presence a
sense of the incompossible, [mingling]{.mark} what was [with what might
have been]{.mark}.]{.underline} We can see this co-presence at work in
performance and video artist Wu Tsang\'s 2012 film for how we perceived
a life (Take 3), which revis- its and re-performs LaBeija\'s audacious
moment of backchat from The Queen.18 The short video begins with five
performers in a huddle, who emerge to enact short sequences that combine
elements from the dia- logue of both Paris Is Burning and The Queen,
into which the artist has also interpolated dialogue from subsequent
interviews a\' well as archi- val footage she recovered from the UCLA
Film & Television Archives. Serving the children shade and color,
Tsang\'s ensemble moves as a living reenactment of the cinematic
apparatus, which they manage to bring to an abrupt and stuttering series
of halts. If documentary cinema imposes sequential, periodizing,
\"time-stamped\" time upon the everyday, the trans-aesthetic of queer of
color performance here moves in and through the cut, accumulating
temporal vignettes in a layered and folded manner that suspends
historicity. 19 Yet even though it is grounded in both archi- val
research and oral history, for how we perceived a life is nothing like
an earnest historical reconstruction. It is instead a performed
fabulation, construed here through a technique the artist has called
\"full body quo- tation.\" [Through quoting and re-performing
decontextualized fragments from these germinal films, for how we
perceived a life explores the need of the black and brown feminist,
queer, and transgender participants in the ballroom scene to be seen,
heard, and felt, while resisting the temp- tation to accept visibility
under dominative constraints as the fulfillment of that
wish]{.underline}.20 The implicit theory of the archive in Tsang\'s
term, \"full body quotation,\" is telling.21 Through it, Tsang seeks to
locate new aims for past goals, finding in the historical record a set
of fabulous resources and stratagems. [Turning the gaze back upon the
filmmakers, quoting from archival footage of Jennie Livingstone (who is
mostly unseen and unheard in Paris Is Burning), and citing LaBeija\'s
protest of The Queen, for how we perceived a life implicitly raises
questions about its own status as a fiction.]{.underline}

The question of value, then, reconfigures our proper metaphysical
question. In essence, it inquires about how to ground value of a being
lacking place in the world.32 The illustrators provide an answer to this
inquiry: since [[black being exists for **destruction**]{.mark}, why not
make this being [an extension of **war machines**]{.mark}?]{.underline}
In this fantasy, [black being is [a **sentient weapon**, blurring the
distinction between]{.mark} **machine** and flesh, [**weapon** and
body.]{.mark}]{.underline} Warfare provides value for sentient refuse.
[[Black bodies are]{.mark} literal [**artilleries** of destruction ---
there is no self]{.mark} to protect, [just]{.mark} an open
[**vulnerability** to deadly violence]{.mark}]{.underline}. We might
also suggest that the black weapon prefigures the suicide bomber, which
preoccupies contemporary analysis of necropolitics. But martyrdom is
absent from such an analysis because [[the black weapon is pure use
value.]{.underline}]{.mark} The weapon does not sacrifice itself;
[[**destruction** is its reason for existence]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Black weapons also lack any relationality between humans and a political
community from which to ground such self-sacrifice. Black death,
vulnerability, injury, and destruction are mere comedic by-products of a
war between humans. In the image, soldiers easily affix cannons to black
bodies and position these weapons in the line of fire. The battlefield
is precisely the space of emancipation --- a death-scape. And the being
emancipation creates in this space is the black weapon. [**War**
allegorizes the metaphysical holocaust, which places black being in
extraordinary harm]{.underline} without regard to any ontological ground
of resistance. [This war]{.underline}, unlike the Civil War, [is
**without end**. [The **black weapon** is]{.mark} being for another
[within an economy of brutality, **strategy**, and
calculation]{.mark}.]{.underline} This catachrestic fantasy realizes the
terror Heidegger envisioned with his critique of technological
reasoning. The complete collapse between technology and flesh could only
be realized with black being, and the image articulates this
understanding.33 It is unthinkable that the union soldiers would become
weapons because they are human beings. Thus, it is not just that the
image is viciously satirical, but also that the image exposes a kernel
of truth: [[it]{.mark} is indeed plausible that black being could be
used in such a way in an antiblack world.]{.underline} Humor encases a
metaphysical truth. [Black being lacks ontological security and [is
**malleable** in the hands of humans. This is **ontological
terror**.]{.mark}]{.underline} We might also revisit the Lacanian terms
enjoyment and interpassivity --- for it seems that both are operative in
the catachrestic fantasy[. The cynosure of [the image is a black
weapon]{.mark} with a minstrel-like smile]{.underline} (a smile that
indicates utter obsequiousness to vicious demands and unawareness of
immediate danger), [gladly [sitting]{.mark} on the ground [to facilitate
the **soldier's reloading**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The smile is a
signifier of stupid enjoyment, a masochistic embrace of destruction.
Through the smile, the black weapon is aligned with the nothing and all
the terror it entails. The smile, then, is the figuration of
interpassivity and enjoyment. [[The **terror** of nothing is projected
onto]{.mark} black bodies ([black weapons]{.mark} must hold the
**destructive** enjoyment for the white subject, standing as a
substitutional receptacle for the human's enjoyment),]{.underline} and
the enjoyment is vicious --- it is the enjoyment of continual
destruction (the metaphysical holocaust).34 The smile also dockets a
certain duty or obligation of black being --- to rejoice in destruction
as service (in this way, service as black suicide is inconceivable for
the illustrator; only honor and duty explain the stupid enjoyment. The
illustrators, then, impose a fallacious agency on the weapon, which is
part of the vicious humor, since a weapon has no choice in the
matter/manner of its destruction). And we might say the smile signals
"arbitrary \[black\] death as a legitimate feature of a system," as
Lewis Gordon poignantly notes.35 The arbitrariness of black perishment
exposes its meaningless enjoyment through the loss of meaning.36 [[The
metaphysical world is a **battlefield** for blacks, blacks
**reconfigured** as weapons for a war without end.]{.mark} At any
moment, at any time, blacks could perish]{.underline} --- or, to retool
Heidegger, this perishment occurs in einem Augenblick (in a blink of an
eye, or immediately). Again, I am using the term perishment over
Gordon's death to docket the utter lack of meaning and being black
destruction entails. [Thus, there can never be Ereignis for black
weapons, no event in which death enables an authentic embrace of being.
Heideggerian death is impossible for black being. [There is only death
as]{.mark} **perishment** --- meaningless, arbitrary, and [**eventless**
destruction]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The smile is the internecine
sign of this destruction. The smile, then, is absolutely essential to
the image (its punctum, to borrow Barthes's term).37 The smile gets us
to the essence of the image. What the black weapon is smiling at is
nothing. This, ultimately, is the fantasy the illustrator presents, and
it serves to disavow the brutal context within which the weapon is
placed. For the illustrator, blacks embrace the terroristic nothing
antiblackness imposes upon it. Imposition is recast as masochistic
embrace. The image stages an encounter with nothing as a dutiful embrace
of onticide. [[The black body is **finished**.]{.mark} The image
articulates the closure of metaphysics: the [black]{.mark} body [is
nothing more than an antiblack invention, an **instrument** of a
destructive]{.mark} will to [power]{.mark}]{.underline}. Any agency we
imagine we can extract from this body by reclaiming and celebrating it
has evaporated in a toxic atmosphere. [By closure, however, I do not
mean the end (as is the fantasy of some postmetaphysicians) but the
**completion** of its internecine aim concerning black being. [The
aim]{.mark}, the metaphysical enterprise, [is to **sever** the flesh
from the body through]{.mark} the work of [violence, **degradation**,
and terror, such that what is left is not a human body, but a]{.mark}
body as **[machine]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This is what the image
proudly proclaims. The image, then, can be read as an antiblack
celebration, a triumph over black being (and the intransigent remainder
of the flesh). In his brilliant essay "The Black Body as Fetish,"
Anthony Farley argues that [[the black body]{.mark} serves as the object
of white fantasy; the body [is pressed into narratives of]{.mark}
savagery and **[degradation]{.mark}** to maintain white mastery and
racial innocence.]{.underline} Taking something like Žižek's advice,
"Enjoy your symptom," seriously,38 Farley suggests that a masochistic
embrace of the function of the black body in antiblack fantasy produces
pleasure (or jouissance):

Complementing the traditional focus on production with greater attention
to [the growing significance of **consumption** within [global
**capitalism** provides new]{.mark} [directions for
understanding]{.mark} the experiences of [African American
youth]{.mark}.]{.underline} Black American youth are far from
marginalized [[within]{.underline} [a]{.underline}]{.mark} [massive
[global black]{.mark} [culture industry that uses their images to
**sell**]{.mark} a wide array of products]{.underline}. Moreover, [black
American youth]{.underline} also [constitute a **consumer
market**]{.underline} of their own [who will purchase music, alcohol,
drugs, cell phones]{.underline}, gym shoes, their own images [and other
products that are **created** **specifically** for them. [African
American youth are]{.mark}]{.underline} not marginalized but rather
remain [essential to new [consumer markets, both as
**suppliers**]{.mark}]{.underline} of commodities that are bought and
sold, [[and]{.mark} as reliable [consumer]{.mark} markets.]{.underline}
[African American youth are a **hot commodity** in the]{.underline}
contemporary [global]{.underline} [marketplace]{.underline} and global
media. [[Their images have **catalyzed** new]{.mark} consumer [markets
for products and services]{.mark}.]{.underline} The music of [[hip hop
culture, for example]{.underline}]{.mark}, follows its rhythm and blues
predecessor as a so-called crossover genre that is very popular with
whites and other cultural groups across the globe. [[**Circulated**
through film, television, and music]{.mark}, **news and advertising**,
[mass media]{.mark} constructs and [sells]{.mark} a [**commodified**
black culture]{.mark} from ideas about class, gender and
age.]{.underline} [Through]{.underline} a wide array of [genres ranging
from talk shows to feature length films]{.underline}, television
situation comedies to CDs, video rentals to cable television, [the
images produced and **circulated** within this area all aim [to
**entertain**]{.mark}]{.underline} and amuse [[a]{.underline}]{.mark}
highly segmented [consumer]{.underline} [[market]{.underline}]{.mark}.
This market is increasingly global and subject to the contradictions of
global marketplace phenomena.2 One implication of the significance of
consumption for understanding social class relations of black youth
concerns the constant need to stimulate consumer markets. [Contemporary
[capitalism relies]{.mark}]{.underline} not just
[[on]{.underline}]{.mark} cutting the costs attached to production, but
also on [[**stimulating** consumer demand]{.mark}.]{.underline} Just as
sustaining relations of production requires a steady supply of people to
do the work, sustaining relations of consumption needs ever-expanding
consumer markets. Moreover, [just as people do not naturally work and
must be encouraged or compelled to do so, [people do not engage in
excess consumption without **prompting**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this
context, [[advertising constitutes an important site that
**creates**]{.underline} [**demand** for
commodities]{.underline}]{.mark} [of all sorts.]{.underline} Marketing
and advertising often create demand for things that formerly were not
seen as commodities, for example, the rapid growth of the bottled water
industry, as well as for intangible entities that seem difficult to
commodify. In this regard, [[the]{.mark} rapid [growth of mass
media]{.mark} and new informational **technologies** [has
catalyzed]{.mark} a [**demand** for black culture as a
commodity]{.mark}.]{.underline} As the black culture industry
recognizes, most [market demand]{.underline} for products and services
[stems not from needs but]{.underline} rather from [unmet desires that
must be constantly stimulated.]{.underline} In this context, physical
addictions create ideal consumers who are willing to assume debt to pay
for their addictions. If consumers become addicted to tobacco, alcohol,
drugs or similar products, despite health risks, they can be counted on
to consume. As the repetitive behavior of shopping addicts suggests,
[the ideal consumer is]{.underline} one who is [addicted to
**consumption itself**]{.underline}, never mind the actual product or
service consumed. In this context, [[the interconnections among the
marketing of black culture, addictive behavior]{.mark} of consumers who
buy its products, [and]{.mark} any [consumer debt]{.mark} that ensues
[are **tightly linked**]{.mark}]{.underline}.3 Under this ever-expanding
impetus to create new consumer markets, [[nothing is exempt from]{.mark}
commodification and [**sale**, including the pain that African American
youth experience]{.mark} with **poverty and
powerlessness**.]{.underline} Nowhere is this more evident than in the
contradictions of rap. As Cornel West points out,'the irony in our
present moment is that just as young black men are murdered, maimed and
imprisoned in record numbers, their styles have become
disproportionately influential in shaping popular culture' (West, 1993).
In this context, [[rap becomes the only place where black youth
have]{.mark} public [voice, yet it is]{.mark} a public voice that is
**[commodified]{.mark}** and contained [by what]{.mark} hip hop
[producers think will sell.]{.mark}]{.underline} Despite these
marketplace limitations, rap remains a potential site of contestation, a
place where African American youth can rebel against the police
brutality, lack of jobs, and other social issues that confront them
(Kelley, 1994). Thus, [work on the black culture industry illustrates
how images of black culture function to catalyze
consumption.]{.underline}

#### **Stereotyped images of "authentic" Blackness over-codes Black identity into categories classified by what will sell in the marketplace of global racial capitalism. Black pimps, prostitutes, and rappers [define]{.underline} the nature of this system---wherein Blackness is put up for sale on an [auction block]{.underline} and sold to the [highest bidder]{.underline}.**

[[Black male involvement in the sex work industry
may]{.underline}]{.mark} not [[involve]{.underline}]{.mark} the direct
exploitation of black men's bodies as much as [[the]{.mark}
objectification and [commodification of sexualized black male images
within **hip hop** culture]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [The
prevalence of **representations** of black men as pimps speaks to this
image of black men as sexual hustlers who use their sexual prowess to
**exploit** women]{.underline}, both black and white. Ushered in by a
series of films in the 'Blaxploitation' era, the ubiquitous black pimp
seems here to stay. Kept alive through HBO produced quasi-documentaries
such as [Pimps Up, Hos Down, African American men feature prominently in
**mass media**]{.underline}. Despite these media constructions, actual
pimps see themselves more as businessmen than as sexual predators. For
example, the men interviewed in the documentary American Pimp all
discuss the skills involved in being a successful pimp. One went so far
as to claim that only African American men made really good pimps. Thus,
the controlling image of the black pimp combines all of elements of the
more generic hustler, namely, engaging in illegal activity, using women
for economic gain, and refusing to work. [[Representations of black
women and men as **prostitutes** and **pimps** **permeate** music
videos, film and television.]{.mark} In]{.underline} the context of a
powerful [global mass media, black men's bodies are **increasingly
objectified** within popular culture]{.underline} [in ways that resemble
the treatment of all women. [Violence and sexuality **sell**,]{.mark}
and associating [black men]{.mark} with both [is]{.mark}]{.underline}
virtually [[sure to please]{.underline}]{.mark}. Yet [the real struggle
is]{.underline} less [about]{.underline} the content of black male and
black female images and more about [the treatment of black people's
bodies as **valuable** **commodities** within advertising and
entertainment.]{.underline} [[Because this new constellation of images
participates in **commodified global capitalism**]{.underline}]{.mark},
in all cases, [[representations of black]{.mark} people's [bodies are
tied to]{.mark} structures of **[profitability]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Athletes and criminals alike are profitable, not for the vast majority
of African American men, but for the [[people]{.underline}]{.mark} who
own the teams, control the media, provide food, clothing and telephone
services to the prisons, and who **[[consume]{.underline}]{.mark}**
seemingly [[**endless** images of pimps, hustlers,]{.mark} rapists, [and
felons]{.mark}]{.underline}. What is different, however, is how [[these
images]{.mark} of authentic blackness [generate]{.mark} additional
**[consumer markets]{.mark}**]{.underline} beyond the selling of these
specific examples of cultural production. [Recognizing the value of
commodified **black culture**, many African American [rap stars]{.mark}
have [start]{.mark}ed [their own]{.mark} record labels, clothing
[companies]{.mark}, and more recently, sports drink
divisions]{.underline}. [Their desire lies in sharing the **profits** of
a huge global consumer market of]{.underline} youth who purchase the rap
CDs, sports drinks, gym shoes, and clothing lines of [hip hop
culture]{.underline}. Take, for example, [the 2003 release of [Pimp
Juice, a]{.mark} new [sports beverage]{.mark}]{.underline} that was
lauded by Vibe magazine as the best energy drink. Despite Pimp Juice's
claims that it provides vitamins and that its 10 percent apple juice
content makes it healthy, [the yellow and white design of its can
[resembles beer cans.]{.mark}]{.underline} Initially, [Pimp Juice was
[**marketed** within African American
neighborhoods]{.mark}]{.underline}, yet by 2004 Pimp Juice was
disseminated by 60 distributors in the United States, in 32 states and
in 81 markets. According to [[its]{.underline}]{.mark} distributor,
because [Pimp Juice is [flying off the shelves]{.mark} in the UK, the
Caribbean Islands, and Mexico]{.underline}, the distributor aims to sell
the product in Australia, Japan, China and Israel. The irony of this
particular product is that [[Nelly]{.mark}, the rap star whose [song
titled 'Pimp Juice']{.mark} helped resurrect the **popularity** of the
concept of the pimp]{.underline}, also owns the company that distributes
Pimp Juice. [This one product [illustrates the]{.mark} increasingly
[seamless relations among]{.mark} the [commodification of **black
images**]{.mark} (pimp/prostitute), [struggles between
**corporations**]{.mark} and hip hop capitalists (rap star Nelly) in
search of new consumer markets, [the expansion of new]{.mark} consumer
[markets]{.mark} (how Pimp Juice is marketed to black consumers),
[and]{.mark} potentially [new systems of **control** within]{.mark}
African American civil [society]{.mark} that grow from the same
conditions that sparked changes within Nigerian society]{.underline}.
Beverage makers claim that pimp juice is a benign sports drink --
www.letitloose.com, Pimp Juice's official web site describe it as a
'healthy, non-carbonated energy drink possessing a tropical berry
flavor' -- yet when Black American youth buy pimp juice at their corner
store, they most likely are singing the lyrics Nelly's song 'Pimp Juice'
while they pay \$1.89 for one can of actual 'Pimp Juice'. The lyrics of
Nelly's song 'Pimp Juice' make it clear what pimp juice really is and
who it is for. Nelly opens his song by boasting that because his woman
only wants him for his 'pimp juice', he needs to 'cut her loose'. He
then moves on to describe the power seats, leather and sunroof of his
pimpmobile. When 'hoes see it', according to Nelly, they 'can't believe
it'. Nelly knows their game and puts them out, telling them to dust
their shoes off so as not to touch his rug. For those who still don't
get it, Nelly ends his song with a rousing definition of pimp juice:
'your pimp juice is anything, attract the opposite sex, it could be
money, fame, or straight intellect'. Always an equal-opportunity kind of
guy, [Nelly proclaims, 'bitches got the pimp juice too, come to think
about it dirty, they got more than we do'. By itself, the song 'Pimp
Juice' is just a song. Yet when coupled with [the music video of]{.mark}
Nelly representing a pimp and **mass marketing campaigns** that [put
cans of]{.mark} actual [Pimp Juice in corner stores]{.mark} for young
African Americans to see and buy, [the circle is
**complete**]{.mark}]{.underline}. African American youths' encounters
with Pimp Juice comprise the case examined here, yet [the new
commodities and new consumer markets in this example point to much
**larger issues**. [The hip hop capitalism of Nelly's]{.mark} brilliant
[marketing]{.mark} of 'Pimp Juice' [illustrates how sexualized
understandings of black]{.mark} women's and men's [bodies and culture
become]{.mark} marketed and [**put up for sale** **in the global
marketplace**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It also focuses on new consumers of
bodies and images, in particular, how [[black people become target
audiences for their **own degradation**]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g. the
case of pimp juice) as well as Nelly's plans to go global with this
popular product. When it comes to the commodification of black bodies,
few African Americans celebrate the criminal justice system. At the same
time, [when it comes to the commodification of images associated with
prison culture as well as an array of **products** that seemingly signal
a seemingly authentic black culture, blacks are well represented among
the consumers of these images.]{.underline}

metareflective analysis that is necessary to make sense of what it means
for Black people to have forged an identity through the muck and mire of
white racism. After all, [[Black folk]{.mark} [were deemed **inherently
inferior**]{.mark}**, cultureless**, without Geist. [Yet, Black agency
survived]{.mark}]{.underline} the tortuous African blood-stained water
of the Atlantic. [Like Jazz]{.underline} (with its improvisatory
structure and chromatic form), [the Blues]{.underline} (with its
ontology of lyrically holding at a distance incredible pain and sorrow),
[and rap music]{.underline} (with its phat beats, lyrical braggadocio,
and in yo face street reality), [[African American Language is a
significant site of Black **cultural
innovation**]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [syncretism, [and
survival]{.mark}]{.underline}**[[, laden with situated **epistemological
insights**]{.underline}.]{.mark} There is no other way to honor the work
of Geneva Smitherman, [to explore the "**language- gaming**" of everyday
Black folk]{.underline}, without directly and unapologetically entering
into the dynamic, rhythmic, ritual, and cognitive spaces of African
American linguistic expressiveness. [Hence, from the very giddayup, that
is, befo I bees gittin into some really dope cultural, historical,
philosophical, and **linguistic analyses**, [let's engage in a lil bit
of **naming and claiming**. Word! The power of
**Nommo**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Geneva Smitherman (a.k.a. [[Docta G)
is]{.underline}]{.mark} an educational activist, [[a **word
warrior**]{.mark}**, a language rights fighter**, a linguist-activist,
and a linguistic democratizer]{.underline}. Can I get a witness? Yeah,
that's right. [She is the legitimizer of African American Language
(**AAL**)]{.underline} (Smitherman 2001, 347). [[The shonuff sista from
the]{.mark} [hood who is **cognizant** of what it means to be a New
World African]{.mark}, to be linked to that shonuff Black space of
talkin and testifyin, stylin and profilin.]{.underline} [[AAL is the
**language of her nurture**]{.underline}]{.mark} (343). She was, after
all, baptized "in the linguistic fire of Black Folk" (Smitherman 1997,
242). Believe me, [[for if I'm lyin, I'm flyin]{.mark}, she knows the
source of those deleted copulas]{.underline} ("The coffee cold"), those
post-vocalic --r sounds ("My feet be tied," not "tired"), redundant past
tense markings ("I likeded her," not "liked"), few consonant pairs
("Those tesses was hard," not "tests"), [stylizations, and rhetorical
devices. [Docta G operates within]{.mark} that unique African American
space of [performative "languaging," a **space of agency, contestation,
self-definition**]{.mark}, poiesis, [and hermeneutic
combat]{.mark}]{.underline}. She is all up in the cultural sphere of
ashy knees, nappy hair, and how we be actin so saddity. Ah, yes, and she
knows about the hot comb as a cultural artifact of self-hatred, a form
of hatred instilled through the power of colonial white aesthetics.
[[She **member** where she come from. She got **no desire to front**.
Docta G's medium is the message]{.underline}]{.mark}. She avoids what
linguist- philosopher John L. Austin refers to as the "descriptive
fallacy," which involves the assumption that the main function of
language is to describe things. Through the incorporation of AAL flava
in her written works (and no doubt in her lectures), Docta G is doing
something with those words and phrases. [[Her
writings]{.underline}]{.mark}, in short, [[are]{.mark} demonstrative
[enactments of]{.mark} the historical, [stylistic, political,
communicative]{.mark}, cognitive, [and **social ontological power** of
A]{.mark}frican [A]{.mark}merican [L]{.mark}anguage. Docta G is the lion
who has learned]{.underline} how to write, [how to narrate a
**counterhistorical narrative**, and how to recognize and theorize a
counterlanguage. [A **metalinguist**, she is a cultural, ethical, and
political theorist]{.mark}.]{.underline} If push comes to shove, she'll
"choose goodness over grammar" (349). She knows that the politics of
language policy is a larger question of the politics of reality
construction, historical structuring of society, race, class, and
Anglo-linguistic imperialism. As such, she moves between both the
sociolinguists (who stress social and ethnic language) and the Cartesian
or Chomskyan linguists (who stress "ideally competent" language). She
knows that [the right to speak [AAL is a question of **linguistic
freedom, agency, and justice**]{.mark}.]{.underline} A womanist,
[[moving within that bold, **self-assertive**, and we-affirming
space]{.mark} of sistas like Angela Davis, Alice Walker, Patricia Hill
Collins, Sojourner Truth, and Harriet Tubman, [Docta G is responsible,
in charge, and serious. **She's no prisoner of the
academy**]{.mark}]{.underline}; rather, she is existentially and
politically committed to the Black community, its survival, and the
continual actualization of its cultural generative force. Smitherman
maintains that a womanist denotes an "African-American woman who is
rooted in the Black community and committed to the development of
herself and the entire community" (Smitherman 1996, 104). African
American women, empowered by their womanist consciousness, were
well-aware that white feminists had failed to critique,
self-reflexively, the normativity of their own whiteness.
Epistemologically, Black womanists occupied their own subject positions,
positions that did not square with the theorizations of white
middleclass women. [[You dig]{.underline}]{.mark} (Wolof: dega) [[what
I'm sayin? **Can I get an Amen?**]{.underline}]{.mark} Docta G,
"daughter of the hood," raised in Brownsville, Tennessee, was culturally
immersed in the rich locutionary acts of Black folk (Smitherman 2000,
xiii). [Y'all wit me?]{.underline} I'm pointing to the significant links
between Docta G's biographical location and how this influenced her
later theorizations about AAL. Consistent with feminist, womanist,
social constructionist, and postmodernist insights, one's social
location is a significant hermeneutic lens through which to understand
one's theorizations. [By emphasizing one's social location, [one is able
to avoid the obfuscating process of
**reification**.]{.mark}]{.underline} As social constructionists Peter
L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann maintain, "Reification is the apprehension
of human phenomena as if they were things, that is, in non-human or
possibly suprahuman terms" (Berger and Luckmann 1995, 36). In short, the
lived-context, as existential phenomenology stresses, is always already
presupposed in relationship to epistemological claims. Docta G, daughter
of the Black ghetto, daughter of Reverend Napoleon, was an early witness
to the illocutionary and perlocutionary acts of a linguistically rich
Black family, a sharecropping community, and a Traditional Black Church.
For example, [she knows the power of tonal semantics, a significant
feature of AAL that moves the listener through melodic structure and
poignant **rhetorical configuration**.]{.underline} She relates that her
father once expressed the following theme in one of his sermons: "I am
nobody talking to Somebody Who can help anybody" (Smitherman 2001, 222).
[Geneva]{.underline}, monolingual and from the sociolinguistic margins,
[was well-aware of what it meant to be deemed a problem, to endure the
pain of being told that her speech was "**pathological**," "**wrong**,"
"**inferior**," "bad," and "derelict."]{.underline} Having gone North
(or was it simply up South?) where she attended college, Geneva had to
pass a test "in order to qualify for the teacher preparation program"
(1). Given the then oppressive and racist language policy, a policy that
stressed the importance of teachers being able to speak the language of
those who "carry on the affairs of the English-speaking people" (2),
[Geneva did not pass **the speech test**.]{.underline} Docta G explains:
We found ourselves in a classroom with a speech therapist who wasn't
sure what to do with us. Nobody was dyslexic. No one was aphasic. There
was not even a stutterer among us. I mean here was this young white
girl, a teaching assistant at the university, who was just trying to get
her Ph.D., and she was presented with this perplexing problem of people
who didn't have any of the communication disorders she had been trained
to deal with. (2) Although Geneva eventually passed the test by simply
memorizing the pronunciation of particular sounds she needed to focus
on, she came to interpret this experience as key to stimulating her
politico-linguistic consciousness. She relates that "it aroused the
fighting spirit in me, sent me off into critical linguistics and I
eventually entered the lists of the language wars" (3). Clearly, this
experience created in Geneva a powerful sense of agency and praxis. On
the strength! You know it. As Kenyan philosopher and literary figure
Ngu\~gi\~ wa Thiong'o argues, "There is no history which is purely and
for all time that of actors and those always acted upon" (Thiong'o 1993,
131). [Uhm [talkin bout]{.mark} a Womanist, [Docta G. You know, the
chief]{.mark} expert [witness for]{.mark} the **[linguistic
intelligence]{.mark}** of Black children, the one who has made it her
**political project [to challenge]{.mark}** effectively [the totalizing
systems of Euro]{.mark}/Anglo-[linguistic **cultural
normativity**.]{.mark}]{.underline} You betta act like you know. [[She
fightin against African American **linguistic erasure**. Naw]{.mark},
even more so, [she fightin for African American
**hue-manity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Docta G reveals that AAL is not
some broken, ersatz sign system relegated to the confines of ghetto
life; rather, [[AAL is the language of Black
America]{.underline}]{.mark} (Smitherman 2001, 350). [[Docta
G]{.underline}]{.mark} is up on it; she [[operates]{.mark} [in
that]{.mark} deeply deep space of African American signs and symbols, a
[**semiotic space** where]{.mark} individual [words]{.mark} and phrases
[carry the]{.mark} weight of an entire
**[world]{.mark}-view**]{.underline}. As Frantz Fanon asserts, "[[To
speak a language is to take on a world, a culture]{.underline}]{.mark}"
(Fanon 1967, 38). [[I'm talkin bout an entire life-world where folk
gotta live under]{.mark} conditions of much **[oppression]{.mark}**, at
the bottom, [where Black bodies]{.mark} and souls constantly [struggle
to move within a]{.mark} compressing and [**collapsing social cosmo**s.
Sendin out an **S.O.S. call**.]{.mark}]{.underline} There appears to be
a blue shift in the Black existential universe. [[But]{.mark} as we move
to the center of it all, to the heart and soul of these historicizing,
**proud Black people**, [we notice a]{.mark} dynamic [process of
**reconstitution, reinterpretation**, being]{.mark}, [and becoming. We
be a **praxis oriented** people]{.mark} who are defined by our
communicative acts, [our]{.mark} **existential** [**improvisatory**
modes of being, forms of world-making, and ways of
**re-narrating**]{.mark}, over and over again, our historical and
spiritual **links to Africa and the Americas.**]{.underline}

#### Just as stereotypes of Black culture [interpolate]{.underline} Black flesh, framework debaters must [impute norms]{.underline} onto us to render our scholarship "[fair]{.underline}" and "[educational]{.underline}". When they cannot deal with what we stand for, they deal with the [disembodied parts]{.underline} that connect us to a larger abstract rule in debate, categories readily available to [process deviant interpretations]{.underline}. Their framework arguments search and try to [classify]{.underline} us into rules we somehow broke, categorizing based on their own [limited understandings]{.underline} of this activity.

#### **Linguistic Dominance DA---We decided to use African American Language to capture the mood of what it means to live Black. Outside of debate, in the streets where style matters and blood is shed, subversive Black linguistic stylings are necessary to survive. Debating in this way not only helps me to remember our forgotten heritage, but to make inroads against established power-lines of this activity. Framework argues that "you don't have to use those practices to make your point", but that completely misses the point. For them, our language and norms are not viable, not legitimate semiotic mediums for debate, we are "too Black" not "proper" enough. But the normative functions of "predictability, education, and fairness" create a kind of dislocation for Black debaters. Endorse our scholarship to break down the respectability of this community and refuse the limits of linguistic standardization.**

Series, Volume 18, Number 4, pp. 273-299, "Geneva Smitherman: The Social
Ontology of African-American Language, the Power of Nommo, and the
Dynamics of Resistance and Identity Through Language") \\\\EG

In order to illustrate the interpenetration between life and philosophy,
I recently wrote a short and selective philosophical autobiography
exploring my philosophical development (Yancy 2002).1 In the chapter,
[[I]{.mark} consciously [decided to use]{.mark} the **language of my
nurture** ([African American Language]{.mark}), the **linguistic
express**ions of my life-world, that language [which helped]{.mark} to
**[capture the mood]{.mark}** and texture [of what it was like for me to
live]{.mark} within]{.underline} the heart of North Philadelphia, one of
America's Black [ghettoes]{.underline}. After all, [what other
linguistic medium could I use to **articulate the rhythm**, the
fluidity, the angst, the **aesthetics** of coolness, and the beauty
involved in traversing those **dangerous**, challenging, and inviting
**ghetto streets**? [These streets were sites where style
mattered]{.mark}, where respect was key, [where **blood** **was shed**,
where families were poor]{.mark}, weary, and often [hopeless]{.mark},
where who you knew could save your life, and [where you **had to be
bad**, had to project that]{.mark} tough [image]{.mark} in order [to
survive.]{.mark}]{.underline} Writing about the background of this
existential space of anguish and hope, a background within which my
philosophical self evolved, was no easy task. However, [[writing in the
language of my nurture not only helped me to remember]{.mark} much of
[**what was "forgotten,"** but]{.mark} helped me [to make "inroads
against]{.mark} the [**established power-lines of
speech**"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Potter 1995, 58) After having read my
chapter, [[a white philosopher]{.underline}]{.mark} whom I admire came
up to me at an American Philosophical Association (APA) conference and
told me how he really enjoyed the piece and how he had not known so many
intimate details about my life. He [[added]{.mark}: "I really enjoyed
it, but [why did you use]{.mark} that language \[meaning [African
American Language\]?]{.mark}]{.underline} You write very well \[meaning
in "Standard" American English\]. [**[You don't have to use
that]{.mark}** **language** [to make your point]{.mark}]{.underline}." I
listened in silence, realizing that [[he completely **missed the
point**]{.underline}.]{.mark} Indeed, [[for him, African American
Language was not]{.mark} a **[viable]{.mark} language**, [not a
legitimate **semiotic medium**]{.mark} through which my life-world could
best be **represented**.]{.underline} Rather, in his view, the language
that I chose to use was slang, an ersatz form of communication that
clearly should not have been used. [By using African American English
[I]{.mark}]{.underline} [[had]{.underline}]{.mark} somehow fallen from
the true heights of academic professionalism and [[broken the norms of
**respectable** philosophy-speak.]{.underline}]{.mark} Indeed, [perhaps
[he thought that I was being "**too Black**" in my speech,]{.mark} not
white enough, [**not "proper" enough**.]{.mark}]{.underline} As Frantz
Fanon observed, "[Nothing is more astonishing than to hear a black man
express himself properly, for then in truth he is putting on the white
world]{.underline}" (Fanon 1967, 36). Fanon's observations suggest
deeper relationships that may exist between the function of language and
a specifically racialized and racist philosophical anthropology. Again,
Fanon observed: The Negro of the Antilles will be proportionately
whiter---that is, he will come closer to being a real human being---in
direct ratio to his mastery of the French language. I am not unaware
that this is one of man's attitudes face to face with Being. [A Man who
has a language consequently possesses the world expressed and **implied
by that language**. What we are getting at becomes plain: [Mastery of
language affords **remarkable power**]{.mark}]{.underline}. (18, my
emphasis) Fanon's observations also contain profound implications for
the specifically racial and cultural dimensions of philosophy-speak.
Indeed, [perhaps in the U.S. it is [philosophy-speak]{.mark} that [is
**"too white,"** creating a]{.mark} kind of [**dislocation** for many
Black folk]{.mark}]{.underline} who find it necessary to speak African
American Language to communicate some subtle cultural experience or way
of "seeing the world" philosophically. This does not mean that
Anglo-American or [[European languages]{.underline}]{.mark} are
inherently inadequate for expressing philosophical ideas per se; rather,
the point is that [these languages [are presumed the **normative
media**]{.mark} through which philosophy qua philosophy can best be
**engaged**]{.underline}. It is the imperialist and, of course,
colonialist, tendency of these languages that is being rejected.
Nevertheless, in my chapter, it was not I who failed philosophy, but
[[it]{.mark} was "Standard" American English---that dominant,
territorial, **imperial medium of philosophical
expression**]{.underline} in the U.S.---[that [failed to convey the
logic, the **horror**]{.mark}, the humanity, the existentially rank, the
confluent, and the **surreal realities [embedded in my
experiences]{.mark}** in one of America's Black ghetto
enclaves.]{.underline}

#### Black knowledge is in excess of "Standard" debating and language. Some forms of knowledge become substantially truncated and distorted if not expressed through their familiar linguistic and normative mediums. Here, the medium must be the message. Via the Middle Passage, Blacks were forced to learn the language of the colonizer, to estrange themselves from their culture and identity. By participating in the norms of debate while engaging with Black vernacular, we call into question this activity itself and rupture the authority of our norms. To best articulate that Black existential space, you gotta get wit da medium.

**Yancy '04** (George Yancy, George Dewey Yancy is an American

[It is here that one might ask: "Are Anglo-American and European
**philosophical forms of discourse inadequate** for re-presenting the
complexity of Black experiences?"]{.underline} After all, not any form
of discursivity will do. [[My experiences were in **excess of**]{.mark}
what ["Standard"]{.mark} American [English]{.mark} could capture.
[Some]{.mark} [forms of knowledge become **substantially truncated and
distorted**]{.mark}, indeed, erased, [if not expressed through the
familiar linguistic media of those who have possession of such
knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}. In a passage rich with issues concerning
the lack of power and effectiveness of "Standard" American English to
capture the personal identity and personal experiences of a young Black
boy, writer R. DeCoy asks: [[How ... my Nigger Son, can you ever hope to
**express** what you are, who you are]{.mark} or your experiences with
God, [in a language **so limited**,]{.mark} conceived by a people who
are **quite helpless** in explaining themselves? [How can you, my Nigger
Son, find your **identity**, articulate your experiences, in an order of
**words**?]{.mark}]{.underline} (quoted in Brown 2001, 59--60) Regarding
white philosophers (or even Black ones) who simply fail to understand
the importance of African American Language as a rich cultural and
philosophical site of expression, I believe that [it is the job of
knowledgeable and responsible Black philosophers]{.underline}---at least
for those who are willing to admit that they speak both the Language of
Wider Communication (or LWC) and the powerful vernacular shaped by
African retentions and African American linguistic nuances---[to invite
them to enter African American semiotic spaces of discursive difference
and overlap.]{.underline} We should keep in mind that being Black or
African American in North America does not ipso facto mean that one is
familiar with the subtle complexities and power of African American
Language. After all, there are Black philosophers from middle-class (and
lower-class) backgrounds whose linguistic assimilation of "Standard"
American English, a form of cultural capital ownership and privilege,
functions both as a badge of white acceptance and as an antidote for
reducing white anxiety and fear. [The invitation, though, should not be
a plea, but an **honest gesture** to explore the language on its own
terms. This is why it was so very important that this present article be
written unapologetically in the language of my nurture: [the]{.mark}
**[medium had to be the message]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Keep in mind
that an invitation is not the same as a forced introduction. This was
the situation that [[Blacks]{.underline}]{.mark} of African descent
faced; they [[were forced to learn the **language of the
colonizer**]{.mark}, forced to split, [to multiply in]{.mark} so [many
different cultural, psychological, linguistic, and spiritual directions
**against their will**.]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}The fact that this
article appears in the Journal of Speculative Philosophy invites a
certain level of cultural and linguistic splitting on the part of its
readers, perhaps not very different from what is required when reading
Kant or Heidegger, particularly given their penchant for neologism.
Let's be honest, articles that typically appear in the Journal of
Speculative Philosophy have no doubt been written in "Standard" American
English and by predominantly white male philosophers, philosophers who
have been trained to engage in "proper" philosophical prose. I, too, can
write in this language. [To write in this language is to **reproduce the
professional culture** of philosophy, to perpetuate lines of power, and
to show that you have been "properly" educated and worthy of
hire.]{.underline} Moreover, to engage in this discourse is to perform
linguistically before an audience of gatekeepers who probably fear too
much fat in their discourse, too much play, too much signifying, too
much indirection, too much ambiguity, too much vagueness, too much
concrete, everyday reality. Like African American Language within the
larger context of "Standard" American Language, [[by appearing in this
journal this article]{.mark} also [enters into a space of established
norms of linguistic propriety, **calling into question** and]{.mark}
perhaps [**rupturing** the authority of "Standard" philosophical prose,
that **unhip discourse of professional**
philosophers.]{.mark}]{.underline} Of course, having this article
published in this journal could turn out to be a curse or a blessing.
Realizing the degree to which "proper" philosophical discourse is
required by philosophy journals, and how such discourse in turn shapes
and legitimates philosophy journals, many readers of the journal may
read the article with contempt. Some may approach the article as a piece
of exotica. Some may even view my use of African American Language as a
disgraceful "Stepin Fetchit" performance that does a disservice to Black
philosophers who are all too eager to perform well in the presence of
white power, to show the world that we be real philosophers because we
speak the language of Mister Charlie. Then, of course, there are some
philosophers who are open to creative possibilities, differences, and
alternatives to hegemonic linguistic territorialism, who believe in
plural experiences and multiple discourses for articulating them. It's
here, of course, that [[I got]{.mark} [to give props to my man]{.mark}
JJS [for being hip to the importance of **multiple**]{.mark}
**philosophical [voices]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the different and
[**complex** existential spaces]{.mark} within which they emerge. When
the medium is the message, [one has got to **get wit da
medium.**]{.mark}]{.underline} It will take more than this article to
create a significant impact on a certain linguistic-philosophical
reference point that is buttressed by so much history and power, but the
Journal of Speculative Philosophy is a good place to begin, right in the
midst of professional philosophy-speak. [[To best articulate that Black
existential space where the]{.mark} real [world]{.mark} (not that
abstract possible world) [is filled with **pain**]{.mark}, struggle,
**blood**, tears, and laughter---[where **death follows**]{.mark} a
minute of joy, [where so much is **improvisatory**]{.mark} **and
surreal**, moving with the quickness, [where]{.mark} [the streets
are]{.mark} hot, **[dangerous]{.mark}**, and familial, [where]{.mark}
love is abundant and [hate smiles in **yo face**, where]{.mark} melodic

**babies cry all night long**, because mama done gone and hit the pipe,
where a brotha gots to be down, where brothas be runnin game, talkin

**fluency** in the language that]{.mark} partly [grows out of the
nitty-gritty **core of the epistemology** and ontology of that

#### Linguistic Policing DA---The norms of debate are put into service for nefarious purposes. Ruthless in its policing duties, framework has no purpose other than maintaining narcissism and its own dominance. It actively thwarts the intellect, stalls conscience, suppresses potential and it cannot tolerate our new revolutionary practices. Framework excites reverence and summons false memories of stability in an imagined time before performative and critical debate. When this activity dies our of disuse and fiat, framework teams must be accountable. They speak only to those who obey and impose forced obedience on radical teams like us. Framework is a language crafted to lock revolutionaries into categories of hopelessness, inferiority, and death. It is your obligation to endorse out rejection and alteration of the norms of debate, norms that drink blood and hide its fascism under the guise of respectability. **Morrison** '93 (Toni Morrison, The Nobel Prize in Literature 1993 Lecture, Toni Morrison is an American novelist, essayist, editor, teacher, and professor emeritus at Princeton University.

Speculation on what (other than its own frail body) that
bird-in-the-hand might signify has always been attractive to me, but
especially so now thinking, as I have been, about the work I do that has
brought me to this company. So [I choose to read the **bird as
language** and the woman as a practiced writer. She is worried about how

language as susceptible to death, erasure; certainly imperiled and

in the hands of her visitors is dead the custodians are responsible for
the corpse. For her [a **dead language** is not only one no longer
spoken or written, it is unyielding language content to admire its own

## XT -- Nommo

### AT -- Using Non-Nommo With Nommo

#### Black knowledge is in excess of "Standard" language. Some forms of knowledge become substantially truncated and distorted if not expressed through their familiar linguistic medium. Here, the medium must be the message. Via the Middle Passage, Blacks were forced to learn the language of the colonizer, to estrange themselves from their culture and identity. By selectively using nommo, we call into question dominant power structures and rupture their authority. To best articulate that Black existential space, you gotta get wit da medium.

**Yancy '04** (George Yancy, George Dewey Yancy is an American
philosopher who has been a professor of philosophy at Emory University
since fall 2015. He is also a distinguished Montgomery Fellow at
Dartmouth College, 2004, The Journal of Speculative Philosophy, New
Series, Volume 18, Number 4, pp. 273-299, "Geneva Smitherman: The Social
Ontology of African-American Language, the Power of Nommo, and the
Dynamics of Resistance and Identity Through Language") \\\\EG

[It is here that one might ask: "Are Anglo-American and European
**philosophical forms of discourse inadequate** for re-presenting the
complexity of Black experiences?"]{.underline} After all, not any form
of discursivity will do. [[My experiences were in **excess of**]{.mark}
what ["Standard"]{.mark} American [English]{.mark} could capture.
[Some]{.mark} [forms of knowledge become **substantially truncated and
distorted**]{.mark}, indeed, erased, [if not expressed through the
familiar linguistic media of those who have possession of such
knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}. In a passage rich with issues concerning
the lack of power and effectiveness of "Standard" American English to
capture the personal identity and personal experiences of a young Black
boy, writer R. DeCoy asks: [[How ... my Nigger Son, can you ever hope to
**express** what you are, who you are]{.mark} or your experiences with
God, [in a language **so limited**,]{.mark} conceived by a people who
are **quite helpless** in explaining themselves? [How can you, my Nigger
Son, find your **identity**, articulate your experiences, in an order of
**words**?]{.mark}]{.underline} (quoted in Brown 2001, 59--60) Regarding
white philosophers (or even Black ones) who simply fail to understand
the importance of African American Language as a rich cultural and
philosophical site of expression, I believe that [it is the job of
knowledgeable and responsible Black philosophers]{.underline}---at least
for those who are willing to admit that they speak both the Language of
Wider Communication (or LWC) and the powerful vernacular shaped by
African retentions and African American linguistic nuances---[to invite
them to enter African American semiotic spaces of discursive difference
and overlap.]{.underline} We should keep in mind that being Black or
African American in North America does not ipso facto mean that one is
familiar with the subtle complexities and power of African American
Language. After all, there are Black philosophers from middle-class (and
lower-class) backgrounds whose linguistic assimilation of "Standard"
American English, a form of cultural capital ownership and privilege,
functions both as a badge of white acceptance and as an antidote for
reducing white anxiety and fear. [The invitation, though, should not be
a plea, but an **honest gesture** to explore the language on its own
terms. This is why it was so very important that this present article be
written unapologetically in the language of my nurture: [the]{.mark}
**[medium had to be the message]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Keep in mind
that an invitation is not the same as a forced introduction. This was
the situation that [[Blacks]{.underline}]{.mark} of African descent
faced; they [[were forced to learn the **language of the
colonizer**]{.mark}, forced to split, [to multiply in]{.mark} so [many
different cultural, psychological, linguistic, and spiritual directions
**against their will**.]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}The fact that this
article appears in the Journal of Speculative Philosophy invites a
certain level of cultural and linguistic splitting on the part of its
readers, perhaps not very different from what is required when reading
Kant or Heidegger, particularly given their penchant for neologism.
Let's be honest, articles that typically appear in the Journal of
Speculative Philosophy have no doubt been written in "Standard" American
English and by predominantly white male philosophers, philosophers who
have been trained to engage in "proper" philosophical prose. I, too, can
write in this language. [To write in this language is to **reproduce the
professional culture** of philosophy, to perpetuate lines of power, and
to show that you have been "properly" educated and worthy of
hire.]{.underline} Moreover, to engage in this discourse is to perform
linguistically before an audience of gatekeepers who probably fear too
much fat in their discourse, too much play, too much signifying, too
much indirection, too much ambiguity, too much vagueness, too much
concrete, everyday reality. Like African American Language within the
larger context of "Standard" American Language, [[by appearing in this
journal this article]{.mark} also [enters into a space of established
norms of linguistic propriety, **calling into question** and]{.mark}
perhaps [**rupturing** the authority of "Standard" philosophical prose,
that **unhip discourse of professional**
philosophers.]{.mark}]{.underline} Of course, having this article
published in this journal could turn out to be a curse or a blessing.
Realizing the degree to which "proper" philosophical discourse is
required by philosophy journals, and how such discourse in turn shapes
and legitimates philosophy journals, many readers of the journal may
read the article with contempt. Some may approach the article as a piece
of exotica. Some may even view my use of African American Language as a
disgraceful "Stepin Fetchit" performance that does a disservice to Black
philosophers who are all too eager to perform well in the presence of
white power, to show the world that we be real philosophers because we
speak the language of Mister Charlie. Then, of course, there are some
philosophers who are open to creative possibilities, differences, and
alternatives to hegemonic linguistic territorialism, who believe in
plural experiences and multiple discourses for articulating them. It's
here, of course, that [[I got]{.mark} [to give props to my man]{.mark}
JJS [for being hip to the importance of **multiple**]{.mark}
**philosophical [voices]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the different and
[**complex** existential spaces]{.mark} within which they emerge. When
the medium is the message, [one has got to **get wit da
medium.**]{.mark}]{.underline} It will take more than this article to
create a significant impact on a certain linguistic-philosophical
reference point that is buttressed by so much history and power, but the
Journal of Speculative Philosophy is a good place to begin, right in the
midst of professional philosophy-speak. [[To best articulate that Black
existential space where the]{.mark} real [world]{.mark} (not that
abstract possible world) [is filled with **pain**]{.mark}, struggle,
**blood**, tears, and laughter---[where **death follows**]{.mark} a
minute of joy, [where so much is **improvisatory**]{.mark} **and
surreal**, moving with the quickness, [where]{.mark} [the streets
are]{.mark} hot, **[dangerous]{.mark}**, and familial, [where]{.mark}
love is abundant and [hate smiles in **yo face**, where]{.mark} melodic
[sounds fight to stay above the sounds of **gunfire**,]{.mark} where
**babies cry all night long**, because mama done gone and hit the pipe,
where a brotha gots to be down, where brothas be runnin game, talkin
that talk, **keepin it real**, and showin much loyalty---[requires
**fluency** in the language that]{.mark} partly [grows out of the
nitty-gritty **core of the epistemology** and ontology of that
space.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### **[XT -- General]{.underline}** 

#### **In the streets where blood is shed and being bad is necessary to survival, a Black vernacular re-establishes lost African heritage and challenges established power-lines of speech. Every argument they make about how Nommo is unnecessary proves a Eurocentric sentiment that we aren't "proper enough", that being "too black" is a crime.**

Ontology of African-American Language, the Power of Nommo, and the
Dynamics of Resistance and Identity Through Language") \\\\EG

In order to illustrate the interpenetration between life and philosophy,
I recently wrote a short and selective philosophical autobiography
exploring my philosophical development (Yancy 2002).1 In the chapter,
[[I]{.mark} consciously [decided to use]{.mark} the **language of my
nurture** ([African American Language]{.mark}), the **linguistic
express**ions of my life-world, that language [which helped]{.mark} to
**[capture the mood]{.mark}** and texture [of what it was like for me to
live]{.mark} within]{.underline} the heart of North Philadelphia, one of
America's Black [ghettoes]{.underline}. After all, [[what other
linguistic medium could I use to **articulate the rhythm**,]{.mark} the
[fluidity]{.mark}, the [angst]{.mark}, the **[aesthetics]{.mark}** of
coolness, [and]{.mark} the [beauty involved]{.mark} in traversing
[those]{.mark} **dangerous**, challenging, and inviting [**ghetto
streets**? These streets were sites where style mattered]{.mark}, where
respect was key, [where **blood** **was shed**, where families were
poor]{.mark}, weary, and often [hopeless]{.mark}, where who you knew
could save your life, and [where you **had to be bad**, had to project
that]{.mark} tough [image]{.mark} in order [to
survive.]{.mark}]{.underline} Writing about the background of this
existential space of anguish and hope, a background within which my
philosophical self evolved, was no easy task. However, [[writing in the
language of my nurture not only helped me to remember]{.mark} much of
[**what was "forgotten,"** but]{.mark} helped me [to make "inroads
against]{.mark} the [**established power-lines of
speech**"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Potter 1995, 58) After having read my
chapter, [[a white philosopher]{.underline}]{.mark} whom I admire came
up to me at an American Philosophical Association (APA) conference and
told me how he really enjoyed the piece and how he had not known so many
intimate details about my life. He [[added]{.mark}: "I really enjoyed
it, but [why did you use]{.mark} that language \[meaning [African
American Language\]?]{.mark}]{.underline} You write very well \[meaning
in "Standard" American English\]. [**[You don't have to use
that]{.mark}** **language** [to make your point]{.mark}]{.underline}." I
listened in silence, realizing that [he completely **missed the
point**]{.underline}. Indeed, [[for him, African American Language was
not]{.mark} a **[viable]{.mark} language**, [not a legitimate **semiotic
medium**]{.mark} through which my life-world could best be
**represented**.]{.underline} Rather, in his view, the language that I
chose to use was slang, an ersatz form of communication that clearly
should not have been used. [By using African American English
[I]{.mark}]{.underline} [[had]{.underline}]{.mark} somehow fallen from
the true heights of academic professionalism and [[broken the norms of
**respectable** philosophy-speak.]{.underline}]{.mark} Indeed, [perhaps
[he thought that I was being "**too Black**" in my speech,]{.mark} not
white enough, **not "proper" enough**.]{.underline} As Frantz Fanon
observed, "[Nothing is more astonishing than to hear a black man express
himself properly, for then in truth he is putting on the white
world]{.underline}" (Fanon 1967, 36). Fanon's observations suggest
deeper relationships that may exist between the function of language and
a specifically racialized and racist philosophical anthropology. Again,
Fanon observed: The Negro of the Antilles will be proportionately
whiter---that is, he will come closer to being a real human being---in
direct ratio to his mastery of the French language. I am not unaware
that this is one of man's attitudes face to face with Being. [A Man who
has a language consequently possesses the world expressed and **implied
by that language**. What we are getting at becomes plain: [Mastery of
language affords **remarkable power**]{.mark}]{.underline}. (18, my
emphasis) Fanon's observations also contain profound implications for
the specifically racial and cultural dimensions of philosophy-speak.
Indeed, [perhaps in the U.S. it is [philosophy-speak]{.mark} that [is
**"too white,"** creating a]{.mark} kind of [**dislocation** for many
Black folk]{.mark}]{.underline} who find it necessary to speak African
American Language to communicate some subtle cultural experience or way
of "seeing the world" philosophically. This does not mean that
Anglo-American or [[European languages]{.underline}]{.mark} are
inherently inadequate for expressing philosophical ideas per se; rather,
the point is that [these languages [are presumed the **normative
media**]{.mark} through which philosophy qua philosophy can best be
**engaged**]{.underline}. It is the imperialist and, of course,
colonialist, tendency of these languages that is being rejected.
Nevertheless, in my chapter, it was not I who failed philosophy, but
[[it]{.mark} was "Standard" American English---that dominant,
territorial, **imperial medium of philosophical
expression**]{.underline} in the U.S.---[that [failed to convey the
logic, the **horror**]{.mark}, the humanity, the existentially rank, the
confluent, and the **surreal realities [embedded in my
experiences]{.mark}** in one of America's Black ghetto
enclaves.]{.underline}

#### Ey, why do language always be trippin. Get dat shit outta here. **Morrison** '93 (Toni Morrison, The Nobel Prize in Literature 1993 Lecture, Toni Morrison is an American novelist, essayist, editor, teacher, and professor emeritus at Princeton University.

Speculation on what (other than its own frail body) that
bird-in-the-hand might signify has always been attractive to me, but
especially so now thinking, as I have been, about the work I do that has
brought me to this company. So [I choose to read the **bird as
language** and the woman as a practiced writer. She is worried about how
the [language]{.mark} she dreams in]{.underline}, given to her at birth,
[[is]{.mark} handled, [put into service]{.mark}, even withheld from her
[for]{.mark} certain [**nefarious purposes**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Being
a writer [she thinks of language partly as a system, partly as a living
thing over which one has **control**, but mostly as **agency** -- as an
act with consequences.]{.underline} So the question the children put to
her: "Is it living or dead?" is not unreal because she thinks of
language as susceptible to death, erasure; certainly imperiled and
salvageable only by an effort of the will. She believes that if the bird
in the hands of her visitors is dead the custodians are responsible for
the corpse. For her [a **dead language** is not only one no longer
spoken or written, it is unyielding language content to admire its own
**paralysis**. [Like statist language, **censored** and censoring.
**Ruthless** in its policing duties, it has no]{.mark} desire or
[purpose other than maintaining]{.mark} the free range of its own
[**narcotic narcissism**, its own]{.mark} exclusivity and
[dominance]{.mark}]{.underline}. However moribund, it is not without
effect for [[it]{.mark} actively **[thwarts]{.mark} the
[intellect]{.mark}**[, stalls conscience, **suppresses**]{.mark} human
[potential]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unreceptive to interrogation, [[it
cannot]{.mark} form or [**tolerate** new ideas]{.mark}, shape other
thoughts, tell another story, fill baffling silences.]{.underline}
Official [language]{.underline} smitheryed to sanction ignorance and
preserve privilege [is a **suit of armor** polished to shocking glitter,
a **husk** from which the knight departed long ago]{.underline}. Yet
there it is: dumb, predatory, sentimental. [[Exciting
**reverence**]{.underline}]{.mark} in schoolchildren, providing shelter
for despots, [[summoning **false memories** of stability]{.mark},
harmony among the public.]{.underline} She is convinced that [[when
language dies]{.mark}, out of carelessness, disuse, indifference and
absence of esteem, or killed by fiat]{.underline}, not only she herself,
but [[all users]{.mark} and makers [are **accountable**]{.mark} for its
demise]{.underline}. In her country children have bitten their tongues
off and use bullets instead to iterate the voice of speechlessness, of
disabled and disabling language, of language adults have abandoned
altogether as a device for grappling with meaning, providing guidance,
or expressing love. But [she knows **tongue-suicide** is not only the
choice of children. It is common among the infantile heads of
[state]{.mark} and power merchants whose evacuated [language
leaves]{.mark} them with [no access to]{.mark} what is left of their
[human instincts for they speak only to]{.mark} [those who **obey**,
or]{.mark} in order [to **force obedience**. The systematic **looting of
language** can be recognized]{.mark} by the tendency of its users to
forgo its **nuanced**, complex, mid-wifery properties [for **menace and
subjugation**. Oppressive language]{.mark}]{.underline} does more than
represent violence; it [[is **violence**]{.underline}]{.mark}; does more
than represent the limits of knowledge; [[it **limits knowledge**.
Whether it is]{.mark} obscuring [state language or]{.mark}]{.underline}
the faux-language of mindless media; whether it is [the]{.underline}
proud but calcified [[language of the academy]{.mark} or the
commodity]{.underline} driven [language of science]{.underline}; whether
it is the malign language of law-without-ethics, or language designed
for the estrangement of minorities, [hiding its **racist plunder** in
its literary cheek -- [it must be **rejected, altered and exposed**. It
is the language that **drinks blood**, laps vulnerabilities]{.mark},
tucks its fascist boots under crinolines of
**respectability**]{.underline} and patriotism as it moves relentlessly
toward the bottom line and the bottomed-out mind. [[Sexist]{.mark}
[language, racist language]{.mark}, theistic language -- all
[are]{.mark} typical of the [**policing** **languages** of mastery,
and]{.mark}]{.underline} [[cannot]{.underline}]{.mark}, [do not [permit
new knowledge or]{.mark} encourage [the]{.mark} **mutual
[exchange]{.mark}** [of ideas.]{.mark}]{.underline} The old woman is
keenly aware that no intellectual mercenary, nor insatiable dictator, no
paid-for politician or demagogue; no counterfeit journalist would be
persuaded by her thoughts. [[There is]{.mark} and will be [rousing
language to keep citizens armed and arming; **slaughtered and
slaughtering**]{.mark} in the malls, courthouses, post offices,
playgrounds, bedrooms and boulevards; stirring, [memorializing language
to **mask**]{.mark} the pity and waste of needless
[death.]{.mark}]{.underline} There will be more diplomatic language to
countenance rape, torture, assassination. [There is and will be more
**seductive**, mutant language designed to throttle women,]{.underline}
to pack their throats like paté-producing geese with their own
unsayable, transgressive words; [there will be more of the language of
**surveillance** disguised as research; of politics and history
calculated to render the **suffering of millions mute**;]{.underline}
[[language glamorized to thrill the dissatisfied]{.mark} and bereft into
assaulting their neighbors]{.underline}; [arrogant pseudo-empirical
language crafted to **lock** creative people into cages of inferiority
and hopelessness. Underneath the eloquence]{.underline}, the glamor, the
scholarly associations, however stirring or seductive, the heart of such
language is languishing, or perhaps not beating at all -- if [[the bird
is]{.mark} [already **dead**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Black knowledge is in excess of "Standard" language. Some forms of knowledge become substantially truncated and distorted if not expressed through their familiar linguistic medium. Here, the medium must be the message. Via the Middle Passage, Blacks were forced to learn the language of the colonizer, to estrange themselves from their culture and identity. By utilizing Black vernacular, we call into question academia and rupture its authority. To best articulate that Black existential space, you gotta get wit da medium.

[It is here that one might ask: "Are Anglo-American and European
**philosophical forms of discourse inadequate** for re-presenting the
complexity of Black experiences?"]{.underline} After all, not any form
of discursivity will do. [[My experiences were in **excess of**]{.mark}
what ["Standard"]{.mark} American [English]{.mark} could capture.
[Some]{.mark} [forms of knowledge become **substantially truncated and
distorted**]{.mark}, indeed, erased, [if not expressed through the
familiar linguistic media of those who have possession of such
knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}. In a passage rich with issues concerning
the lack of power and effectiveness of "Standard" American English to
capture the personal identity and personal experiences of a young Black
boy, writer R. DeCoy asks: [[How ... my Nigger Son, can you ever hope to
**express** what you are, who you are]{.mark} or your experiences with
God, [in a language **so limited**,]{.mark} conceived by a people who
are **quite helpless** in explaining themselves? [How can you, my Nigger
Son, find your **identity**, articulate your experiences, in an order of
**words**?]{.mark}]{.underline} (quoted in Brown 2001, 59--60) Regarding
white philosophers (or even Black ones) who simply fail to understand
the importance of African American Language as a rich cultural and
philosophical site of expression, I believe that [it is the job of
knowledgeable and responsible Black philosophers]{.underline}---at least
for those who are willing to admit that they speak both the Language of
Wider Communication (or LWC) and the powerful vernacular shaped by
African retentions and African American linguistic nuances---[to invite
them to enter African American semiotic spaces of discursive difference
and overlap.]{.underline} We should keep in mind that being Black or
African American in North America does not ipso facto mean that one is
familiar with the subtle complexities and power of African American
Language. After all, there are Black philosophers from middle-class (and
lower-class) backgrounds whose linguistic assimilation of "Standard"
American English, a form of cultural capital ownership and privilege,
functions both as a badge of white acceptance and as an antidote for
reducing white anxiety and fear. [The invitation, though, should not be
a plea, but an **honest gesture** to explore the language on its own
terms. This is why it was so very important that this present article be
written unapologetically in the language of my nurture: [the]{.mark}
**[medium had to be the message]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Keep in mind
that an invitation is not the same as a forced introduction. This was
the situation that [[Blacks]{.underline}]{.mark} of African descent
faced; they [[were forced to learn the **language of the
colonizer**]{.mark}, forced to split, [to multiply in]{.mark} so [many
different cultural, psychological, linguistic, and spiritual directions
**against their will**.]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}The fact that this
article appears in the Journal of Speculative Philosophy invites a
certain level of cultural and linguistic splitting on the part of its
readers, perhaps not very different from what is required when reading
Kant or Heidegger, particularly given their penchant for neologism.
Let's be honest, articles that typically appear in the Journal of
Speculative Philosophy have no doubt been written in "Standard" American
English and by predominantly white male philosophers, philosophers who
have been trained to engage in "proper" philosophical prose. I, too, can
write in this language. [To write in this language is to **reproduce the
professional culture** of philosophy, to perpetuate lines of power, and
to show that you have been "properly" educated and worthy of
hire.]{.underline} Moreover, to engage in this discourse is to perform
linguistically before an audience of gatekeepers who probably fear too
much fat in their discourse, too much play, too much signifying, too
much indirection, too much ambiguity, too much vagueness, too much
concrete, everyday reality. Like African American Language within the
larger context of "Standard" American Language, [[by appearing in this
journal this article]{.mark} also [enters into a space of established
norms of linguistic propriety, **calling into question** and]{.mark}
perhaps [**rupturing** the authority of "Standard" philosophical prose,
that **unhip discourse of professional**
philosophers.]{.mark}]{.underline} Of course, having this article
published in this journal could turn out to be a curse or a blessing.
Realizing the degree to which "proper" philosophical discourse is
required by philosophy journals, and how such discourse in turn shapes
and legitimates philosophy journals, many readers of the journal may
read the article with contempt. Some may approach the article as a piece
of exotica. Some may even view my use of African American Language as a
disgraceful "Stepin Fetchit" performance that does a disservice to Black
philosophers who are all too eager to perform well in the presence of
white power, to show the world that we be real philosophers because we
speak the language of Mister Charlie. Then, of course, there are some
philosophers who are open to creative possibilities, differences, and
alternatives to hegemonic linguistic territorialism, who believe in
plural experiences and multiple discourses for articulating them. It's
here, of course, that [[I got]{.mark} [to give props to my man]{.mark}
JJS [for being hip to the importance of **multiple**]{.mark}
**philosophical [voices]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the different and
[**complex** existential spaces]{.mark} within which they emerge. When
the medium is the message, [one has got to **get wit da
medium.**]{.mark}]{.underline} It will take more than this article to
create a significant impact on a certain linguistic-philosophical
reference point that is buttressed by so much history and power, but the
Journal of Speculative Philosophy is a good place to begin, right in the
midst of professional philosophy-speak. [[To best articulate that Black
existential space where the]{.mark} real [world]{.mark} (not that
abstract possible world) [is filled with **pain**]{.mark}, struggle,
**blood**, tears, and laughter---[where **death follows**]{.mark} a
minute of joy, [where so much is **improvisatory**]{.mark} **and
surreal**, moving with the quickness, [where]{.mark} [the streets

It is my contention that African American linguist Geneva Smitherman is
working within the rich situated practices of Africana philosophy and
should be acknowledged as such. She is self-consciously aware of the
metareflective analysis that is necessary to make sense of what it means
for Black people to have forged an identity through the muck and mire of
white racism. After all, [[Black folk]{.mark} [were deemed **inherently
inferior**]{.mark}**, cultureless**, without Geist. [Yet, Black agency
survived]{.mark}]{.underline} the tortuous African blood-stained water
of the Atlantic. [Like Jazz]{.underline} (with its improvisatory
structure and chromatic form), [the Blues]{.underline} (with its
ontology of lyrically holding at a distance incredible pain and sorrow),
[and rap music]{.underline} (with its phat beats, lyrical braggadocio,
and in yo face street reality), [[African American Language is a
significant site of Black **cultural
innovation**]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [syncretism, [and
survival]{.mark}]{.underline}**[[, laden with situated **epistemological
insights**]{.underline}.]{.mark} There is no other way to honor the work
of Geneva Smitherman, [to explore the "**language- gaming**" of everyday
Black folk]{.underline}, without directly and unapologetically entering
into the dynamic, rhythmic, ritual, and cognitive spaces of African
American linguistic expressiveness. [Hence, from the very giddayup, that
is, befo I bees gittin into some really dope cultural, historical,
philosophical, and **linguistic analyses**, [let's engage in a lil bit
of **naming and claiming**. Word! The power of
**Nommo**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Geneva Smitherman (a.k.a. [[Docta G)
is]{.underline}]{.mark} an educational activist, [[a **word
warrior**]{.mark}**, a language rights fighter**, a linguist-activist,
and a linguistic democratizer]{.underline}. Can I get a witness? Yeah,
that's right. [She is the legitimizer of African American Language
(**AAL**)]{.underline} (Smitherman 2001, 347). [[The shonuff sista from
the]{.mark} [hood who is **cognizant** of what it means to be a New
World African]{.mark}, to be linked to that shonuff Black space of
talkin and testifyin, stylin and profilin.]{.underline} [[AAL is the
**language of her nurture**]{.underline}]{.mark} (343). She was, after
all, baptized "in the linguistic fire of Black Folk" (Smitherman 1997,
242). Believe me, [[for if I'm lyin, I'm flyin]{.mark}, she knows the
source of those deleted copulas]{.underline} ("The coffee cold"), those
post-vocalic --r sounds ("My feet be tied," not "tired"), redundant past
tense markings ("I likeded her," not "liked"), few consonant pairs
("Those tesses was hard," not "tests"), [stylizations, and rhetorical
devices. [Docta G operates within]{.mark} that unique African American
space of [performative "languaging," a **space of agency, contestation,
self-definition**]{.mark}, poiesis, [and hermeneutic
combat]{.mark}]{.underline}. She is all up in the cultural sphere of
ashy knees, nappy hair, and how we be actin so saddity. Ah, yes, and she
knows about the hot comb as a cultural artifact of self-hatred, a form
of hatred instilled through the power of colonial white aesthetics.
[[She **member** where she come from. She got **no desire to front**.
Docta G's medium is the message]{.underline}]{.mark}. She avoids what
linguist- philosopher John L. Austin refers to as the "descriptive
fallacy," which involves the assumption that the main function of
language is to describe things. Through the incorporation of AAL flava
in her written works (and no doubt in her lectures), Docta G is doing
something with those words and phrases. [[Her
writings]{.underline}]{.mark}, in short, [[are]{.mark} demonstrative
[enactments of]{.mark} the historical, [stylistic, political,
communicative]{.mark}, cognitive, [and **social ontological power** of
A]{.mark}frican [A]{.mark}merican [L]{.mark}anguage. Docta G is the lion
who has learned]{.underline} how to write, [how to narrate a
**counterhistorical narrative**, and how to recognize and theorize a
counterlanguage. [A **metalinguist**, she is a cultural, ethical, and
political theorist]{.mark}.]{.underline} If push comes to shove, she'll
"choose goodness over grammar" (349). She knows that the politics of
language policy is a larger question of the politics of reality
construction, historical structuring of society, race, class, and
Anglo-linguistic imperialism. As such, she moves between both the
sociolinguists (who stress social and ethnic language) and the Cartesian
or Chomskyan linguists (who stress "ideally competent" language). She
knows that [the right to speak [AAL is a question of **linguistic
freedom, agency, and justice**]{.mark}.]{.underline} A womanist,
[[moving within that bold, **self-assertive**, and we-affirming
space]{.mark} of sistas like Angela Davis, Alice Walker, Patricia Hill
Collins, Sojourner Truth, and Harriet Tubman, [Docta G is responsible,
in charge, and serious. **She's no prisoner of the
academy**]{.mark}]{.underline}; rather, she is existentially and
politically committed to the Black community, its survival, and the
continual actualization of its cultural generative force. Smitherman
maintains that a womanist denotes an "African-American woman who is
rooted in the Black community and committed to the development of
herself and the entire community" (Smitherman 1996, 104). African
American women, empowered by their womanist consciousness, were
well-aware that white feminists had failed to critique,
self-reflexively, the normativity of their own whiteness.
Epistemologically, Black womanists occupied their own subject positions,
positions that did not square with the theorizations of white
middleclass women. [[You dig]{.underline}]{.mark} (Wolof: dega) [[what
I'm sayin? **Can I get an Amen?**]{.underline}]{.mark} Docta G,
"daughter of the hood," raised in Brownsville, Tennessee, was culturally
immersed in the rich locutionary acts of Black folk (Smitherman 2000,
xiii). [Y'all wit me?]{.underline} I'm pointing to the significant links
between Docta G's biographical location and how this influenced her
later theorizations about AAL. Consistent with feminist, womanist,
social constructionist, and postmodernist insights, one's social
location is a significant hermeneutic lens through which to understand
one's theorizations. [By emphasizing one's social location, [one is able
to avoid the obfuscating process of
**reification**.]{.mark}]{.underline} As social constructionists Peter
L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann maintain, "Reification is the apprehension
of human phenomena as if they were things, that is, in non-human or
possibly suprahuman terms" (Berger and Luckmann 1995, 36). In short, the
lived-context, as existential phenomenology stresses, is always already
presupposed in relationship to epistemological claims. Docta G, daughter
of the Black ghetto, daughter of Reverend Napoleon, was an early witness
to the illocutionary and perlocutionary acts of a linguistically rich
Black family, a sharecropping community, and a Traditional Black Church.
For example, [she knows the power of tonal semantics, a significant
feature of AAL that moves the listener through melodic structure and
poignant **rhetorical configuration**.]{.underline} She relates that her
father once expressed the following theme in one of his sermons: "I am
nobody talking to Somebody Who can help anybody" (Smitherman 2001, 222).
[Geneva]{.underline}, monolingual and from the sociolinguistic margins,
[was well-aware of what it meant to be deemed a problem, to endure the
pain of being told that her speech was "**pathological**," "**wrong**,"
"**inferior**," "bad," and "derelict."]{.underline} Having gone North
(or was it simply up South?) where she attended college, Geneva had to
pass a test "in order to qualify for the teacher preparation program"
(1). Given the then oppressive and racist language policy, a policy that
stressed the importance of teachers being able to speak the language of
those who "carry on the affairs of the English-speaking people" (2),
[Geneva did not pass **the speech test**.]{.underline} Docta G explains:
We found ourselves in a classroom with a speech therapist who wasn't
sure what to do with us. Nobody was dyslexic. No one was aphasic. There
was not even a stutterer among us. I mean here was this young white
girl, a teaching assistant at the university, who was just trying to get
her Ph.D., and she was presented with this perplexing problem of people
who didn't have any of the communication disorders she had been trained
to deal with. (2) Although Geneva eventually passed the test by simply
memorizing the pronunciation of particular sounds she needed to focus
on, she came to interpret this experience as key to stimulating her
politico-linguistic consciousness. She relates that "it aroused the
fighting spirit in me, sent me off into critical linguistics and I
eventually entered the lists of the language wars" (3). Clearly, this
experience created in Geneva a powerful sense of agency and praxis. On
the strength! You know it. As Kenyan philosopher and literary figure
Ngu\~gi\~ wa Thiong'o argues, "There is no history which is purely and
for all time that of actors and those always acted upon" (Thiong'o 1993,
131). [Uhm [talkin bout]{.mark} a Womanist, [Docta G. You know, the
chief]{.mark} expert [witness for]{.mark} the **[linguistic
intelligence]{.mark}** of Black children, the one who has made it her
**political project [to challenge]{.mark}** effectively [the totalizing
systems of Euro]{.mark}/Anglo-[linguistic **cultural
normativity**.]{.mark}]{.underline} You betta act like you know. [[She
fightin against African American **linguistic erasure**. Naw]{.mark},
even more so, [she fightin for African American
**hue-manity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Docta G reveals that AAL is not
some broken, ersatz sign system relegated to the confines of ghetto
life; rather, [[AAL is the language of Black
America]{.underline}]{.mark} (Smitherman 2001, 350). [[Docta
G]{.underline}]{.mark} is up on it; she [[operates]{.mark} [in
that]{.mark} deeply deep space of African American signs and symbols, a
[**semiotic space** where]{.mark} individual [words]{.mark} and phrases
[carry the]{.mark} weight of an entire
**[world]{.mark}-view**]{.underline}. As Frantz Fanon asserts, "[[To
speak a language is to take on a world, a culture]{.underline}]{.mark}"
(Fanon 1967, 38). [[I'm talkin bout an entire life-world where folk
gotta live under]{.mark} conditions of much **[oppression]{.mark}**, at
the bottom, [where Black bodies]{.mark} and souls constantly [struggle
to move within a]{.mark} compressing and [**collapsing social cosmo**s.
Sendin out an **S.O.S. call**.]{.mark}]{.underline} There appears to be
a blue shift in the Black existential universe. [[But]{.mark} as we move
to the center of it all, to the heart and soul of these historicizing,
**proud Black people**, [we notice a]{.mark} dynamic [process of
**reconstitution, reinterpretation**, being]{.mark}, [and becoming. We
be a **praxis oriented** people]{.mark} who are defined by our
communicative acts, [our]{.mark} **existential** [**improvisatory**
modes of being, forms of world-making, and ways of

sense of the diachronic structure of AAL, [it is [important to
understand]{.mark} the historicity and dynamic [remaking of African folk
in racist]{.mark} [America]{.mark}]{.underline}; indeed, [there is the
need to be fully cognizant of what America bees puttin Black folk
through.]{.underline} As I have suggested, Docta G is hip to the
particular forms of life of so many African Americans. [[She is all up
in the epistemological, ontological, and cultural "**language-gaming**"
of Black folk]{.underline}]{.mark}, from the pulpit, within the everyday
urban and rural spaces of African American linguistic performativity, to
the complexity and aesthetics of talkin shit, to rapese. She recognizes
that it is not simply an issue of getting at the lexical core of what
makes AAL unique and legitimate, but it is an issue of "whose culture?"
and "whose values?" and "whose identity?" Peep the insightful lines
where she elaborates, "The moment is not which dialect, but which
culture, not whose vocabulary but whose values, not I vs. I be, but WHO
DO I BE?" (66). [It is a question of the axiological, linguistic, and
**cultural ontology** of identity]{.underline}. But to get at "WHO DO I
BE" involves moving beyond the discourse of pathology and what W. E. B.
Du Bois referred to as our being defined as a problem vis-à-vis white
folk. Therefore, Docta G is engaged in a project that is fueled by
depathologization, celebration, and reclamation of African American
humanity and identity. In sum, then, Ima have to continue writin a
responsible article that captures the broad scope of what Docta G bees
droppin.

### XT -- Rap/Afrocentrism

**The world is Eurocentric -- that's bad -- prefer Afrocentrism**

**Asante '98** (Molefi Kete Asante, Professor and Chair, Department of
Africology & African American Studies at Temple University, 1998,
Dancing between Circles and Lines, "The Afrocentric Idea")\\\\AK

Afrocentrity cannot abandon the structuralism of modernism without
betraying the achievements of culture. African Americans are a
preeminently cultured people within American society, and our
contributions to what is called \"popular American culture\" are
immense. To seek to transcend the African cultural presence in
contemporary society is to quest for anonymity at the very time that
African Americans and Africans are most capable of asserting their
culture. Robert Farris Thompson has argued that [[the modern world
is]{.mark} fundamentally [a world created by the presence of Africans in
the Americas]{.mark}.\" Thus, [African presence]{.mark} in art, science,
Egyptology, literature, politics, and democracy [is a decisive force in
the]{.mark} modern [world as it either affirms or rejects]{.mark} that
[presence]{.mark}.]{.underline} That we Africans have been involved in
making the modem world is precisely why Afrocentrists question the
abandonment of modernism. We are not, however, running away from
ourselves, and while we are in the midst of projecting ourselves to the
world, we do not lose sight of the structural ideas of location, place,
and stance. Nevertheless, the quest for transcendence, in the sense of
going beyond the simple affirmation or rejection of African presence,
does not have to be detrimental to good society; it can be affirming and
fulfilling so long as an Afrocentric agency is constituted in the
creation of a new world. [We must conclude that [modernism\'s problem is
with the use of Africans rather than]{.mark} with the [agency]{.mark} of
Africans. If this unsettles some to the point that they question the
restructuring of the world, [it serves to demonstrate that]{.mark} the
[deconstruction]{.mark} process [was never completed]{.mark} in the
first place. If it had been completed, it would have had to serve up the
abandoned concepts of white racism on the altar of progressive sacrifice
so that we could have a more fully creative world.]{.underline} What
needs to be deconstructed are the means by which human beings in the
Western world have defined a triumphal vision that diminishes other
people. I know that this is a diffiasdfacult road for those who are
committed to the detours of literary analysis and historical
speculation, because once again we are in the area of the forbidden when
we question the Eurocentric ideas about culture. [Unless they are
subjected to severe criticism, [the]{.mark} preponderant [Eurocentric
myths of universalism, objectivity, and classical traditions retain a
provincial European cast.]{.mark} Scholarship rooted in such myths
obviously lacks either historical or conceptual
authenticity.]{.underline} The aggressive seizure of intellectual space,
like the seizure of land, amounts to occupying someone else\'s territory
and claiming it as one\'s own. When this occurs, cultural analysis takes
a back seat to galloping ethnocentric interpretations of phenomena.
[[Applied to the African world, such conceptions become limiting,
restricting, and parochial]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, a
discussion of African cultural history rarely calls forth African
culture in the American context when the discussion is made by
Eurocentric writers. Like the literary critics, the historians dismiss
the African elements that survived and developed on the American
continents as purely temporal. They usually refer to them as \"Negro
culture,\" or speak of \"the African slave in the New World or \"Newt)
emancipation.\" The fact that the spatial referent is Africa is ignored,
and Negro becomes a cryptoterm that is used to designate our
degradation. In this way the Eurocentric writer ties the African to the
Negro, a false concept and a false history, separate from any particular
spatial reality. The word Negro did not exist prior to slavery; both the
term and its application were products of the social and economic
context of the slave trade. Consequently, the attachment of the term
Negro to African means a. negation of history and culture. Furthermore,
the Eurocentric formulations recognize neither African classical thought
nor the African classical past. We are essentially left with a
discontinuous history and an uncertain future. By contrast, the
Afrocentric analysis reestablishes the centrality of the ancient Kemetic
(Egyptian)civilization and the Nile Valley cultural complex as points of
reference for an African perspective in much the same way that Greece
and Rome serve as reference points for the European world. [Thus, the
[Afrocentrist expands]{.mark} human [history by creating a. new path for
interpretation]{.mark}, making words like Negro and colored obsolete and
anachronistic. [African is identified with time, place, and
perspective.]{.mark} Without the Afrocentric perspective, [the
imposition of the European line as universal hinders cultural
understanding and demeans humanity.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**Nommo is the signification of the power of Black rhetoric -- it is not
just a communicative event, but a communal experience that facilitates
reclamation**

**Cummings and Roy 10** (Abhik, Assistant Professor of Educational
Psychology in the Learning Sciences and Human Development Department

Michigan University, 11/11/2010, "Manifestations of Afrocentricity in
Rap Music", Howard Journal of Communication)[\\\\AK](file:///\\AK)

Thus, [[nommo in Afrocentricity signifies the generative power of the
spoken word. The generative function of nommo stems from its focus on
collectivity]{.mark}, which is the essence of African American
spirituality.]{.underline} According to Hamlet (1998), [[nommo is
necessary]{.mark} not only to actualize life but also [to give people a
mastery over things]{.mark}.]{.underline} Nommo's presence can be felt
in all facets of African American life, including interpersonal, group,
public, or mass communication events in which African culture and
experiences are fused[. It is [the quality of nommo that has shaped the
perception of African Americans to regard a communication event]{.mark}
not just as an act where words are spoken in the presence of an
audience, but also [as a communal experience]{.mark} [where]{.mark}
those [words, songs, dance]{.mark}, and so on [give life and meaning to
the event]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the Afrocentric perspective, rhythm,
like speech, must coincide with the generative power of the word so that
the communicator, word, and audience are all of one accord. Rhythm plays
a crucial role in Afrocentric discourse. It is that force that helps to
bring about harmony. Rhythm in the African American context is described
as \`\`the architecture of being . . . only rhythm gives (the word) its
effective fullness'' (Jahn, 1961, p. 161). Asante (1987) seesrhythm
asthe\`\`basis of African American transcendence'' (p.38).Transcendence
is conceived here \`\`not as an escape from but as a reconciliation of
the dualities of existenceömind vs. body, sacred vs. profane, America
vs. Africa'' (G. Stephens, 1991, p.74). In rap music, the musical
elements combine to provide rhythm that facilitatesrhyme and other forms
of expressions such as dance[. Another quality of Afrocentric rhetoric
is [the call-response function]{.mark}, also known as \`\`harmony
indicators'' in Asante's parlance. The rapper [seeks harmony by
summoning the audience to participate]{.mark} in the
rapping.]{.underline} According to Keyes (1984), \`\`call-response is an
interactive network between performer and auditor. The role of such
discourse is to unify and establish cohesiveness. . . . The execution of
a rap depends on this interplay between the participants and
communicative resources within context'' (p. 146). [Thus, [rap music,
with its rich lyrics, rhythm, and poetry]{.mark}, helps [bring the
audience]{.mark} members [to]{.mark} participate and [identify]{.mark}
[with the rapper]{.mark}. In sum, then, African American
[rhetoric,]{.mark} [including]{.mark} [rap]{.mark} music, often
[manifests]{.mark} several characteristics of [nommo]{.mark}.They are
rhythm, soundin' out, repetition, stylin', lyrical quality,
improvisation, historical perspective, indirection, call and response,
and mythication.]{.underline} Rhythm demonstrates how well a speaker
regulates his=her flow of words with correct pauses and
intensifications. In African American culture, words are often expressed
musically and rhythmically and function as a basic measure of the
success of the speaker (Asante,1987). An example, among many, would be
Sugarhill Gang's\`\`Rappers Delight.

**Rap music serves to provide Black communities with common ground -- an
inspiration for survival in a racist America that creates expressive
modes of participation**

[Historical perspective in African American [discourse is used as a way
to motivate audiences to look to their own culture for
inspiration]{.mark}, wisdom, and strength [in order to survive]{.mark}
and grow [in]{.mark} a [racist America]{.mark} (Hamlet,
1998).]{.underline} Throughout history in America, [[music has]{.mark}
always [been one of the few ways African Americans have been able to
express themselves freely.]{.mark} It has been used, in whatever form,
[to articulate their deepest and most enduring feelings and
certainties]{.mark}.]{.underline} Some scholars have stated that it is
in the secular song where the record of African American people's
consciousness can be found (Cummings & Daniel, 1979). [[Rap]{.mark}
music [is an extension of this]{.mark} legacy. [Rappers]{.mark}, as the
contemporary griots, [are expected to be fluent, to testify, to speak
the truth]{.mark}]{.underline} (Smitherman,1997). Kool Moe Dee's
\`\`PumpYour Fist'' is a prime example. In this rap, he speaks of
liberation as the responsibility of the oppressed. Similarly, in their
rap anthem, \`\`Proud to Black,'' Run-DMC speak of racial pride unlike
any other artist since James Brown's \`\`I'm Black and I'm Proud''.
Their lyrics are fiery, innovative, artistic, and patriotic: One of the
most enduring and recognizable characteristics of nommo is call and
response. In the African American communication setting, the
communicator is not a solitary voice[. There is usually [a high level of
synergy present between the communicator and]{.mark} \[their\]
[audience]{.mark}. The audience [members]{.mark} typically
[participate]{.mark} in the speaking or concert event [by calling and
responding to the communicator]{.mark} in different ways. [This]{.mark}
back-and-forth [interaction]{.mark} between the audience and
communicator [is an art]{.mark} form [that provides]{.mark} the audience
with [an opportunity to]{.mark} react favorably to the message while
[helping]{.mark} the communicator [establish a common ground]{.mark}
[between]{.mark} [\[themselves\] and the audience]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Religious events are replete with call7response interactions, but so are
secular events, including rap music. Oftentimes rap music functions as a
conversation drama in which the rappers invite the listeners to
participate in the dynamic process of call and response as in the case
of KRS-One's\` \`Who Protects Us from You'':

**Rap enables an expression of protest that creates solidarity within
Black communities -- an effective mode of resistance that heals and
maintains the community, creating harmony and balance**

**Cummings and Roy 10** (Abhik, Assistant Professor of Educational
Psychology in the Learning Sciences and Human Development Department
within the College of Education and Human Services at West Virginia
University, Master of Science degree in Mathematics from Michigan
Technological University and Ph.D. in Program Evaluation from Western
Michigan University, 11/11/2010, "Manifestations of Afrocentricity in
Rap Music", Howard Journal of Communication)[\\\\AK](file:///\\AK)

In addition to the aforementioned characteristics of nommo that are
often present in rap music, [[rap music]{.mark}, like any other form of
Afrocentric rhetoric, [is]{.mark} frequently [a strong expression of
protest against the racist White establishment.]{.mark}]{.underline}
According to Asante (1987[), African American [rhetoric is combative,
antagonistic]{.mark}, and wholly [committed to the propagation of a more
humanistic vision of the world]{.mark}'']{.underline} (p.170). Aleman
(1992) points out that [[rap]{.mark} music [operates through]{.mark}
both [resistant and empowering voices to create]{.mark} a sense of
[unity]{.mark} in the African American community \`\`[against]{.mark}
dominant and [oppressive structures]{.mark}, as well as by identifying
unjust contradictions in the existent political system'' (p.
5).]{.underline} Similarly, McDonnell (1992) says that rap music is the
\`\`expression of a politics of resistance that has emerged within the
African-American culture'' (p. 90).The police, the government, and
dominant media apparatuses are often the primary targets of critique in
rap (Rose, 1994). For example, [[NWA captures]{.mark} the familiar
reading of [police violence and brutality against African Americans
in]{.mark} their song [\`\`Fuck tha Police'']{.mark}: While an important
facet of Afrocentricity is to challenge the racist system and look for
ways to ameliorate the conditions of African Americans, [the]{.mark}
ultimate [goal]{.mark} of an African American communicator [is
\`\`transformation]{.mark}.]{.underline}'' As Smith (1972) points out,
[Afrocentric [rhetoric is concerned with the stability of the
community]{.mark}, and, in cases of conflict and strife in the
community, the Afrocentric public [discourse functions to bring back
harmony and stability in those]{.mark} problematic
[areas]{.mark}.]{.underline} This transformation and harmony is usually
accomplished through the creative use of language (Smith, 1972). In
contemporary times, many rappers use their creative and persuasive
powers to inspire African Americans to transcend the problems that
plague them and aim for a better life for themselves and their
community. For example, in the song, \`\`The Avenue,'' Kool Moe Dee, an
earlier rapper, admonishes his audience to transcend superficialities
and seek a more meaningful, honest life. [These [rappers]{.mark} are
concerned with [heal]{.mark}ing [and]{.mark} [maintain]{.mark}ing [the
community]{.mark}, [helping]{.mark} the community [to survive]{.mark}
even [in a hostile environment.]{.mark}]{.underline} These expressions
are Africa centered, using rhetorical devices like proverbs, idioms,
environmental images, and metaphors[. Clearly, [we see]{.mark} the
[rappers serving as the African griot or the village oracle, making life
comprehensible, defendable, and reachable]{.mark}.]{.underline} These
rappers have taken their lyrics to explore and criticize community
traditions, social conditions, and mainstream values. [They are
[creating harmony and balance, the very essence of
Afrocentricity]{.mark}.]{.underline}

# Market Pornography -- 1AC

#### Black bodies are [literal artillery]{.underline}---weapons of civil society to justify conflict and [reign terror]{.underline}.

It is from this understanding of [arms]{.underline} that we choose to [descend]{.underline} from with regards to the topic.

**Warren '18** (Calvin Warren, Calvin Warren is an Assistant Professor

from Cornell University and his MA and Ph.D. in African
American/American Studies from Yale University, 2018, *Ontological
Terror: Blackness, Nihilism, and Emancipation*) \\\\EG

The question of value, then, reconfigures our proper metaphysical
question. In essence, it inquires about how to ground value of a being
lacking place in the world.32 The illustrators provide an answer to this
inquiry: since [[black being exists for **destruction**]{.mark}, why not
make this being [an extension of **war machines**]{.mark}?]{.underline}
In this fantasy, [black being is [a **sentient weapon**, blurring the
distinction between]{.mark} **machine** and flesh, [**weapon** and
body.]{.mark}]{.underline} Warfare provides value for sentient refuse.
[[Black bodies are]{.mark} literal [**artilleries** of destruction ---
there is no self]{.mark} to protect, [just]{.mark} an open
[**vulnerability** to deadly violence]{.mark}]{.underline}. We might
also suggest that the black weapon prefigures the suicide bomber, which
preoccupies contemporary analysis of necropolitics. But martyrdom is
absent from such an analysis because [[the black weapon is pure use
value.]{.underline}]{.mark} The weapon does not sacrifice itself;
[[**destruction** is its reason for existence]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Black weapons also lack any relationality between humans and a political
community from which to ground such self-sacrifice. Black death,
vulnerability, injury, and destruction are mere comedic by-products of a
war between humans. In the image, soldiers easily affix cannons to black
bodies and position these weapons in the line of fire. The battlefield
is precisely the space of emancipation --- a death-scape. And the being
emancipation creates in this space is the black weapon. [**War**
allegorizes the metaphysical holocaust, which places black being in
extraordinary harm]{.underline} without regard to any ontological ground
of resistance. [This war]{.underline}, unlike the Civil War, [is
**without end**. [The **black weapon** is]{.mark} being for another
[within an economy of brutality, **strategy**, and
calculation]{.mark}.]{.underline} This catachrestic fantasy realizes the
terror Heidegger envisioned with his critique of technological
reasoning. The complete collapse between technology and flesh could only
be realized with black being, and the image articulates this
understanding.33 It is unthinkable that the union soldiers would become
weapons because they are human beings. Thus, it is not just that the
image is viciously satirical, but also that the image exposes a kernel
of truth: [[it]{.mark} is indeed plausible that black being could be
used in such a way in an antiblack world.]{.underline} Humor encases a
metaphysical truth. [Black being lacks ontological security and [is
**malleable** in the hands of humans. This is **ontological
terror**.]{.mark}]{.underline} We might also revisit the Lacanian terms
enjoyment and interpassivity --- for it seems that both are operative in
the catachrestic fantasy[. The cynosure of [the image is a black
weapon]{.mark} with a minstrel-like smile]{.underline} (a smile that
indicates utter obsequiousness to vicious demands and unawareness of
immediate danger), [gladly [sitting]{.mark} on the ground [to facilitate
the **soldier's reloading**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The smile is a
signifier of stupid enjoyment, a masochistic embrace of destruction.
Through the smile, the black weapon is aligned with the nothing and all
the terror it entails. The smile, then, is the figuration of
interpassivity and enjoyment. [[The **terror** of nothing is projected
onto]{.mark} black bodies ([black weapons]{.mark} must hold the
**destructive** enjoyment for the white subject, standing as a
substitutional receptacle for the human's enjoyment),]{.underline} and
the enjoyment is vicious --- it is the enjoyment of continual
destruction (the metaphysical holocaust).34 The smile also dockets a
certain duty or obligation of black being --- to rejoice in destruction
as service (in this way, service as black suicide is inconceivable for
the illustrator; only honor and duty explain the stupid enjoyment. The
illustrators, then, impose a fallacious agency on the weapon, which is
part of the vicious humor, since a weapon has no choice in the
matter/manner of its destruction). And we might say the smile signals
"arbitrary \[black\] death as a legitimate feature of a system," as
Lewis Gordon poignantly notes.35 The arbitrariness of black perishment
exposes its meaningless enjoyment through the loss of meaning.36 [[The
metaphysical world is a **battlefield** for blacks, blacks
**reconfigured** as weapons for a war without end.]{.mark} At any
moment, at any time, blacks could perish]{.underline} --- or, to retool
Heidegger, this perishment occurs in einem Augenblick (in a blink of an
eye, or immediately). Again, I am using the term perishment over
Gordon's death to docket the utter lack of meaning and being black
destruction entails. [Thus, there can never be Ereignis for black
weapons, no event in which death enables an authentic embrace of being.
Heideggerian death is impossible for black being. [There is only death
as]{.mark} **perishment** --- meaningless, arbitrary, and [**eventless**
destruction]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The smile is the internecine
sign of this destruction. The smile, then, is absolutely essential to
the image (its punctum, to borrow Barthes's term).37 The smile gets us
to the essence of the image. What the black weapon is smiling at is
nothing. This, ultimately, is the fantasy the illustrator presents, and
it serves to disavow the brutal context within which the weapon is
placed. For the illustrator, blacks embrace the terroristic nothing
antiblackness imposes upon it. Imposition is recast as masochistic
embrace. The image stages an encounter with nothing as a dutiful embrace
of onticide. [[The black body is **finished**.]{.mark} The image
articulates the closure of metaphysics: the [black]{.mark} body [is
nothing more than an antiblack invention, an **instrument** of a
destructive]{.mark} will to [power]{.mark}]{.underline}. Any agency we
imagine we can extract from this body by reclaiming and celebrating it
has evaporated in a toxic atmosphere. [By closure, however, I do not
mean the end (as is the fantasy of some postmetaphysicians) but the
**completion** of its internecine aim concerning black being. [The
aim]{.mark}, the metaphysical enterprise, [is to **sever** the flesh
from the body through]{.mark} the work of [violence, **degradation**,
and terror, such that what is left is not a]{.mark} [human body, but
a]{.mark} body as **[machine]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This is what the
image proudly proclaims. The image, then, can be read as an antiblack
celebration, a triumph over black being (and the intransigent remainder
of the flesh). In his brilliant essay "The Black Body as Fetish,"
Anthony Farley argues that [[the black body]{.mark} serves as the object
of white fantasy; the body [is pressed into narratives of]{.mark}
savagery and **[degradation]{.mark}** to maintain white mastery and
racial innocence.]{.underline} Taking something like Žižek's advice,
"Enjoy your symptom," seriously,38 Farley suggests that a masochistic
embrace of the function of the black body in antiblack fantasy produces
pleasure (or jouissance):

**[Respectability politics]{.underline} grasp onto the [pornographic
market]{.underline} to [exploit]{.underline} the bodies of Black women
and [constrain]{.underline} their self-determining [sexual
deviancy]{.underline}.**

For over 30 years western feminists have had powerful and deeply
divisive debates about the roles of pornographic media and sexual
commerce in promoting heterosexist institutions and social relations.
These debates, which became known as the 'Sex Wars', exacerbated many
bitter philosophical divisions between feminists (Duggan and Hunter,
1995). Touting Robin Morgan's catchphrase, '[[Porn is the theory, rape
is the **practice'**]{.mark}, (Morgan, 1980) radical, anti-pornography
feminists defined pornography as the 'graphic and sexually explicit
**subordination** of women through pictures and/or words']{.underline}
(Dworkin and MacKinnon, 1988: 36). According to their argument,
[[porn]{.mark}ography [represents the 'subordination of women
**perfectly** achieved']{.mark}]{.underline}, (Dworkin, 1993: 523) [[as
it commodifies rape, and]{.mark} endorses and [encourages men's
**abusive** sexual desires]{.mark} and behaviors towards
women]{.underline} (Russell, 2000: 50). Alternatively, anticensorship,
liberal, and sex-positive feminists identified pornography as a
convenient but hazardous scapegoat for attacks on sexual dissent, and as
a complex discourse 'full of multiple, contradictory, layered, and
highly contextual meanings' (Duggan and Hunter, 1995: 7). Even within a
heterosexist system of domination, they argued, [[oppressed
groups]{.mark}, such as women and sexual minorities, [view
porn]{.mark}ography in a multiplicity of ways, [often
counter-appropriating]{.mark} seemingly [**exploitative** material and
positively transforming their meaning]{.mark}.]{.underline} Although
largely a heteronormative capitalist mode of production, [pornography
nevertheless offers women and men, consumers and participants, spaces
and possibilities for counter-appropriation, self-expression, pleasure,
and labor]{.underline} (Kipnis, 1997; Weitzer, 2000). On the margins of
the Sex Wars, African American [feminist [scholars have
written]{.mark}]{.underline} a great deal [[about]{.underline}]{.mark}
the issue of [[sexual representation]{.mark}, focusing [on the
exploitation of black women's bodies within patriarchal, **racial
capitalism**]{.mark} in the USA. [They]{.mark} have examined how African
American women's sexualities [are]{.mark} inherently [informed
by]{.mark} the [**objectification**]{.mark} of their bodies
[necessitated by]{.mark} the **sexual economy** of
[slavery,]{.mark}]{.underline} [and black women's own historical efforts
to reclaim their bodies and define their **womanhood**.]{.underline}
These writers explain how [black women have challenged dominant
imaginings of black sexuality as pathological, explaining also their
attempts to achieve sexual autonomy in the face of the widespread
discourse of black sexual deviancy]{.underline} (Hobson, 2005; Rose,
2003; SharpelyWhiting, 2007). Yet, for black women, defining sexual
autonomy has not been an easy task. First, what Evelyn Brooks
Higginbotham (1993) terms [[a 'politics of **respectability'**
has]{.mark} historically [discouraged black women from creating a
**framework** for sexual subjectivity outside of
heteronormative]{.mark}, domestic, and [bourgeois family
relations]{.mark}]{.underline} (White, 2001). Many black queer scholars
(Johnson and Henderson, 2005; McBride, 1998; Stallings, 2007) have noted
the difficulty in addressing issues of sexual subjectivity, due to what
Matt Richardson notes as [[the]{.mark} 'erasure of a broad array of
black sexuality and **gendered being**, in favor of a static
[heterosexual narrative']{.mark}]{.underline} (Richardson, 2003: 63). In
addition to the politics of respectability, historian Darlene Clark Hine
(1989) [[proposes]{.mark} black women possess [a]{.mark} 'culture of
dissemblance', a culture of **masking, silence, secrecy**, and
[**disavowal** of sexuality in black women's lives,]{.mark} employed [as
a]{.mark} [method to **protect** them]{.mark} from sexual
injury.]{.underline} Unfortunately, [[these]{.mark} twin cultural
[traditions]{.mark} frame sexual deviance as dangerous and [marginalize
women who deviate from **respectability**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
dissemblance [by participating in non-normative
sexualities]{.underline}, including queer, contractual, or public
sexuality (Hammonds, 1997; Stallings, 2007). According to Evelynn
Hammonds (1997), 'The restrictive, repressive and dangerous aspects of
black female sexuality has been emphasized by black feminist writers
while pleasure, exploration, and agency have gone under-analyzed' (1997:
385). Those black feminist scholars who have written about pornography
tend to find affinity with radical feminists, deeming the form
inherently dangerous for women -- especially black women. For example,
Patricia Hill Collins (2000), Alice Walker (1980, 1981), Tracy Gardener
(1980), Luisah Teish (1980), and Aminatta Forna (2001 \[1992\]) contend
that [sexual violence is 'typically or implicitly a theme of
pornography']{.underline} (Collins, 2000: 135). Though violence and
misogyny towards black women in pornography, [sex work and elsewhere is
a critical and extremely painful concern]{.underline}, the theoretical
equivalence made by scholars between pornography and violence remains
troubling. Pornography is framed as a monolithic cultural production and
industry and is blamed for the degradation and violation of black women,
rather than situated as a historically complex, dynamic media genre. As
Linda Williams (2004a: 12) notes, pornography is a 'genre for the
production of sexual viewing pleasure' -- including, potentially, black
women's own pleasure.

**A [framework]{.underline} of the [illicit erotic economy]{.underline}
uncovers the [creative and productive]{.underline} elements in a world
of [sexual capital]{.underline}. To [survive]{.underline} and prosper,
Black women own their [sexual deviancy]{.underline} through
transgressions of cultural and social [norms]{.underline}.**

While some hardcore images are misogynistic, violent and racist, not all
pornography is such. [If we look]{.underline}, for example, [at
pornography created by black women such as Vanessa Blue, Diana Devoe,
Venus Hottentot, or Shine Louise-Houston, we see **erotic expression**
that is much more **creative** and **pleasurable** than many critics
might suspect]{.underline}.3 [As producers and consumers, women
participate in pornography's **sexual economy** in ways that suggest
that its consubstantiation with violence and subordination should be
**re-evaluated**]{.underline} (Chapkis, 1997; Duggan and Hunter, 1995;
Juffer, 1998). [[We should]{.mark} also **[interrogate]{.mark}** [how
pornography addresses]{.mark} the sexual [desires]{.mark}, fantasies,
fetishes and expressions [of black]{.mark} sexual
[subjects]{.mark}]{.underline} as well the presumed white male
voyeuristic consumer. [[It is crucial to]{.mark} take [account]{.mark}
of the deeply problematic [issues of **racialized sexism** in
porn]{.mark}ography]{.underline} as a media genre and industry,
[[while]{.mark} at the same time [**uncovering** the voices]{.mark} and
experiences [of black erotic laborers]{.mark} as they mobilize their
sexualities for pleasure and profit.]{.underline} Illicit Eroticism [in
a Global Economy of Sex Work]{.underline} In a globalizing economy where
[media industries and [**sexual** **commerce** offer]{.mark} avenues for
mobility and [profit]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bernstein, 2007; Ehrenreich
and Hoschchild, 2002), [[black women are finding]{.mark} new ways to
employ **erotic embodiment** by putting sexuality to work]{.underline}
in often informal, illicit economies of sex (Achebe, 2004; Collins,
2006; Kempadoo, 1999, 2005). Noting their complex eroticization in
[transnational racial economies of desire]{.underline}, Kemala Kempadoo
asserts that, 'the sale of sexual labor is an integral part of many
working Third World women's lives and strategies' (Kempadoo, 1998: 124).
Through my research on black women in the US porn industry, I developed
[[the paradigm of '**illicit erotic economy'** as a way to
theorize:]{.mark} (1) [the **historical representation** of black bodies
as sites for]{.mark} a vast array of [forbidden sexual desires]{.mark},
fantasies, and practices, [and]{.mark} (2) [how black subjects
symbolically]{.mark} and strategically [labor within the]{.mark}
prohibited **[terrain of sex]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Taking the lead
from the work of Sharon Harley (2002) on African American women's use of
underground economies during the early 20th century, [I [consider
illicit eroticism as a **framework** to understand how]{.mark} [black
subjects labor in the **sexual economy**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
[Reflective of African Americans' historical engagement in informal,
**underground**, illegal, and quasi-legal income generating activities
-- [from prostitution to pimping]{.mark}, drug dealing, music and movie
pirating, street **performance**, and childcare -- [illicit eroticism
offers black women]{.mark} who are marginalized in the formal labor
market [ways to **survive** **and prosper**.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}Encompassing a range of informal and intimate labors, [illicit
[erotic workers employ their **sexual capital**]{.mark}, talents, and
knowledges [to]{.mark} perform sexual service work on 'the margins' of
an economy increasingly focused on the **commodification** of
intimacy]{.underline} (Agustin, 2007: 21; Zelizer, 2005). More than
survival skills, [illicit eroticism [eschew]{.mark}s the [logics of
sexual **respectability**]{.mark}, dissemblance, and normativity. [Black
women in porn]{.mark}ography [transgress multiple]{.mark} moral,
[cultural]{.mark}, and social [boundaries as they]{.mark} [mobilize
their **outlaw**, racialized sexuality for
work]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [They use the demand for their
mythic hypersexuality as a vehicle to]{.underline}, as Luise White
suggests in her research on prostitution in colonial Nairobi, to
'[reproduce themselves and their dependents']{.underline} (1990: 12).
One performer underscores this point -- black women in pornography labor
for their families: 'I have always had a family to take care of, in some
fashion or another. I have no idea what it is like to earn all my money
and keep it all'. Historian Robin D.G. Kelley (1997) argues that this
[selective appropriation of [**selfcommodification** is]{.mark} both
[strategic and creative]{.mark} in its engagement with capitalism:
African Americans have mobilized self-commodification through the
**transformation** of leisure, pleasure, and creative expression into
labor]{.underline}. [[Black sex workers transform]{.underline}]{.mark}
what Kelley defines as 'labor not associated with wage work -- [[sexual
play]{.mark} and intercourse -- [into **income'**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(1997: 73). [This 'play-labor']{.underline} (1997: 45--6) is not
necessarily resistant to hegemonic institutions of power, nor is it
meant to be. It [is one strategy by which young people]{.underline},
women, minorities, Third World subjects, the working-class, and others
[navigate the capitalist political economy by using their corporeal
resources]{.underline} -- resources that may be the only ones they can
control. Participating in a continuum of sexual labor -- [[from dating
to]{.mark} erotic massage, streetwalking, escorting, modeling, [exotic
dance]{.mark}, phone sex, internet porn, S/M domination, [or]{.mark}
performing in [sex films -- black women **strategically maneuver**
the]{.mark} illicit [erotic economy to promote their survival, autonomy,
and well-being]{.mark}.]{.underline} According to my research, women are
motivated by what is considered relatively flexible and high-income work
offering increased opportunities for self-care, and a sense of
recognition for their erotic embodiment and sexual talents. Some enter
the industry on a casual basis, to pay for rent, childcare, school fees,
family bills, or a car, while others seek careers in the sex-obsessed
entertainment industry and see adult entertainment as a stepping-stone
to something else. For many women, fame vis-á-vis [the adult industry is
seen as a viable, if defiant, aspiration --]{.underline} [one that
reflects what cultural critics have noted as the '**pornification'** of
popular culture]{.underline} during the last 15 to 20 years (Paasonen et
al., 2007). [This kind of sexual visibility could reflect a desire by
young black women to harness the subjective power of eroticism made
popular by black actresses, entertainers, and sexual outlaws like Pam
Grier, Lil' Kim, or Josephine Baker.]{.underline}

#### In the [sexual marketplace]{.underline} Blackness is a [devalued commodity]{.underline} of sexual [fantasies]{.underline} sold in a [commercial empire]{.underline} of white idealism.

Hypersexuality to Work: Black Women and Illicit Eroticism in

During seven years of ethnographic forays into adult industry worksites
-- including film sets, production offices, business conventions, awards
ceremonies, and industry events -- I observed many instances of blatant
disregard for black women. Like their locations in the back and on the
margins of the most important adult entertainment business convention in
the world, Adult Video News' Adult Expo, black women's place in the
commercial hardcore industry is peripheral and precarious. [[Black women
are **systemically** positioned in]{.mark} spaces and [roles of
**lesser**]{.mark} [importance to white women, who are valued as the
most **prized commodities** in the **sexual marketplace**]{.mark} of
hardcore.]{.underline} [Women of color]{.underline} generally [occupy a
diminished space in comparison to **idealized** white adult performers,
yet black women seem to be most disparaged]{.underline}, and as a
consequence, vulnerable to the kinds of verbal and symbolic violence
that I witnessed at the Adult Expo. In an industry that values and
trades in the sexuality of women, one would think that black women's
presumed hypersexuality would give them an advantage. In fact,
paradoxically, it is just the opposite. Like the cruel comments of the
director I overheard, [rather than being valued for their erotic skills,
black women are devalued as '**skanks'**.]{.underline} If black women
are so derided in the adult entertainment industry, why do they enter
it, and what do they make of entrenched racism and heterosexism within
the business? Considering the devaluing of their representations and
labor in pornography, I investigate how [[black women put their
**hypersexuality** to work for their own interests in **survival**,
success and erotic autonomy]{.underline}]{.mark} (Alexander, 2005).
[[Hierarchies of value organize the **production, distribution, and**
**consumption** of pornography media, in]{.mark} addition to structuring
work and labor relations in the adult **entertainment industry**.
According to [this]{.mark} logic of [sexual economy]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Davis, 2002), [[some bodies are **worth more** than others; yet all
are]{.mark} evaluated and [commodified]{.mark} through the lens of race,
gender, class, and, sexuality.]{.underline} Although these valuation
regimes are presentin most social and economic institutions and
relations in our society, they are iterated in explicit detail in
hardcore pornography, where [[erotic desires and fantasies are
**commercialized**]{.mark} in a \$12--14 billion dollar per year US
industry that spans the globe]{.underline} (Johnston, 2007). While the
diversification of the sex industries -- including people, products,
services, and technologies -- has transformed and expanded both
productive and consumptive practices, [the hegemony of whiteness in
defining human capital (including erotic value) **disadvantages** people
of color. The black female body is]{.underline}, in relation to other
racialized and gendered bodies in the flourishing sex industries,
[**devalued and marginalized** [in pornography's]{.mark} hierarchal,
[sexual marketplace]{.mark}]{.underline}. While many scholars have
theorized about how gender informs pornography's sexual representations
and labor relations, there is a paucity of research on how [[race forms
a **matrix**]{.mark} of power [that shapes the practices and]{.mark}
[principles of the adult entertainment industry in its visual
representation as well as its structural and social
relations]{.mark}]{.underline} (see Bernardi, 2006; Shimizu, 2007;
Williams, 2004b). In this article I examine the structural inequalities
and social biases black women face in the adult industry. Through the
oral testimonies of these workers, this study reveals that black women
in adult entertainment sustain incisive critiques about how hegemonic
whiteness impacts their conditions of labor, including earnings,
employment opportunities, and erotic embodiment. Responding to these
intersecting racial and gender hierarchies of valuation, black women sex
workers (Leigh, 1997) grapple with the devaluation of their bodies and
sexual labor, sometimes through the creation of pornography that
represents their own desires. [[What can we learn from black sex
workers' **utilization of hypersexuality**]{.mark} and
selfcommodification as they live and labor within advanced
capitalism?]{.underline} Given feminists' entrenched battles over sexual
representation and commerce, I consider the key challenges and concerns
about elucidating black sex workers' supposedly deviant or
counternormative behaviors. I illuminate black women's intimate labor in
hardcore and their struggles for survival, success, and sexual agency.
In my research methodology, which combines feminist methods of
ethnography, oral history, archival and textual analysis, [I situate
[black sex workers]{.mark} as critical knowledge producers and cultural
workers actively laboring to [create space in the sexual marketplace for
a **self-defined** black female sexuality]{.mark}]{.underline}. Engaging
black women working day to day in the sex industry, looking specifically
at their needs, experiences, challenges, and desires, [I argue that it
is precisely through women's **own discussions** of their
representations and labor in the sexual economy that we can analyze the
complexities and ambiguities of black women's experiences of pleasure
and danger, exploitation and disenchantment.]{.underline} Our
methodologies should consider how black women's labor in the sexual
economy indicates their attempts at survival, mobility, self-authorship,
and self-care (Cohen, 2004; Foucault, 1990 \[1978\]).

**Whiteness occupies the [most valuable]{.underline} sexual capital that
situates Blackness within the [sexual market]{.underline} as a
[hyper-disposable]{.underline} repulsive object of exchange.**

Hypersexuality to Work: Black Women and Illicit Eroticism in

What do black women sex workers have to say about the kinds of
challenges to erotic autonomy they confront as they carve out space
within a deeply racialized and gendered sexual economy? In my study,
[black professional adult actresses have been vocal about issues of
**wage inequality**, employment marginalization, and interpersonal bias,
even as they assert their autonomy in choosing to work in the
**pornography industry**]{.underline}. In an industry that treats most
sex workers as disposable, [[black women]{.mark} are the most devalued;
they are [**hyper-disposable**. The perceived easy accessibility of
black]{.mark} women's [sexuality organizes how]{.mark}]{.underline}
hardcore [[media produces and **markets** black female bodies]{.mark} as
well as how it treats black women workers at worksites.]{.underline} I
want to foreground the voices of black women professional sex workers to
understand the function of gendered, racialized, sexuality in the
political economy of adult entertainment with regards to black female
bodies. [Black female bodies are **devalued** [in a]{.mark} [sexual
marketplace that reifies whiteness]{.mark}, especially white
femininity]{.underline} (Nagle, 1997). [[The]{.mark} young, blonde,
lithe, busty, [white woman is constructed as the most valuable **sexual
commodity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As seen at the AVN Adult Expo, [white
women's bodies are the **primary currency** of the]{.underline}
multi-billion dollar adult entertainment [business]{.underline}. They
are the focus of companies like Vivid, Hustler, and Wicked, and they are
the 'cash cows' for an industry that is immensely lucrative for major US
corporations such as AT&T, TimeWarner, and DirectTV that profit from
selling hardcore over pay-per-view cable channels, video on demand, the
internet, and in millions of hotel rooms each year (PBS Frontline,
2001a; PBS Frontline, 2001b). [Although they are fetishized for their
difference, the bodies of [women of color hold much **less
currency**]{.mark} for these corporations [because they receive
significantly **less demand**]{.mark} compared to white female bodies.
[The devalued status]{.mark}]{.underline} of black female bodies
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} significantly [[evident in **wage**
**inequalities**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and this is one of the sorest
issues for black women sex workers in the business. Concentrated in the
bastardized niche genres of black and interracial porn, [[black
actresses have]{.mark}]{.underline} largely [[been]{.underline}]{.mark}
both [[hired less and paid half]{.mark} to three quarters [of what
white]{.mark} female [actresses earn]{.mark}. Black women]{.underline}
contractors for professional companies [are currently paid
\$400--\$900]{.underline} for one 'boy/girl' sex scene, depending on
their notoriety and the company's film budget, while [white actresses
tend to be paid \$1000--\$2000]{.underline}. (Vanessa Blue, 13 August
2008). [Black]{.underline} professional [adult actresses identify
the]{.underline} problems of [pay inequality as part of a wide-ranging,
**exploitative**, and racist devaluation of their labor]{.underline}.
Actress Lola Lane pointed to the inequality and pay: 'I think I am still
not getting equal to what the other girls are getting' (Lola Lane, 10
January 2003). After years in the porn industry, Lola Lane succeeded in
demanding a higher rate from producers than when she started, but she
still felt that it was not equal to white women's pay rates. Sierra,
another professional adult actress and exotic dancer described the ways
that workers lack the knowledge of wage rates that intensifies racial
inequality: The thing is salaries aren't discussed and \[producers\] try
to get you right then and there. You have to negotiate your own salary .
. . I've talked to \[black\] girls who've gotten \$300--400 to do a
scene. I'm like \$300 is all you got? I won't even leave my house for
\$300. You must be crazy! I've known a lot of white girls that come into
the business and get started with regular straight scenes and get \$1000
. . . [Unfortunately, most of us entering this business don't know what
we're worth]{.underline} (Sierra, personal interview, 28 April 2003).
[[Vulnerable to exploitation by pornographers looking for]{.mark} the
next [new talent]{.mark} [at]{.mark} the **[cheap]{.mark}est** cost,
[young women]{.mark} entering the sex industry [are hurt by a culture of
**silence**]{.mark} about wages, exacerbated by a stigmatized and
complex field of work]{.underline}.5 While their age and lack of
knowledge about industry standards for actresses sometimes places them
at a disadvantage, full-time, professional actresses also battle to
maintain their careers in a climate that favors younger women (Diana
Devoe, personal interview, 11 January 2003). As indicated by one African
American adult industry executive, the inequality in pay is the 'primary
issue' for black actresses, and 'knowing that you could have gotten
more, is really disappointing' (Anonymous, personal interview, 5
December 2002). Beyond the issue of wages, [[these]{.mark} contract
[workers feel]{.mark} an [extreme pressure to **conform** to high
standards of whiteness]{.mark} in order [to win]{.mark} opportunities
such as film roles, marketing and PR agreements, and [long-term
contracts. The rule tends to be: live up to the requirements of white
sexual embodiment]{.mark}]{.underline}, in other words,
[**[assimilate]{.mark}** [to white **beauty standards**, or risk being
ghettoized]{.mark} in the most undervalued sectors of the
business,]{.underline} such as the low-end genre of 'ghetto porn'
(Sinnamon Love, personal interview, 5 December 2002). For Lola Lane the
obvious racism embedded in the privileging of white femininity was
painful: You know I've been booked for shoots and they think I'm white
over the phone, (because there's another Lola) and they say 'Oh you're
the black girl. We can't shoot you', or 'Your butt is too big'. So it
can hurt your feelings (Lola Lane, personal interview, 10 January 2003).
[This construction of [beauty]{.mark} and desirability [is]{.mark}
inherently [defined by what it is not -- the **deviant** and repulsive
black]{.mark} woman's [body]{.mark} -- has very real, economic
implications for women of color sex workers]{.underline}. As Lola's
testimony shows, the preference for white actresses and [the
stratification of opportunities along the color line creates a
tremendous sense of **disappointment**, frustration and injustice among
black actresses]{.underline} as they are left out of potentially
lucrative opportunities to work. You have to get that tough skin or
you're not going to make it, otherwise you get low self-esteem. You are
like 'Hey, what's wrong with me?' I go to these casting calls . . . and
they are only looking at the white girls. It's like, 'Why am I here?'
You find it humiliating (Lola Lane, personal interview, 10 January
2003). [Lola's feeling of [constantly feeling **measured**]{.mark}
[against an unattainable]{.mark} and cruel [standard of beauty]{.mark}
and femininity [is something many black women]{.mark} in America [face
everyday]{.mark}]{.underline} (Craig, 2002[). A deeply emotional process
of confrontation, pain, and self-hatred -- and sometimes
counter-hegemonic resistance and healing -- black women must negotiate
their unalterable difference and the overriding **stigma** of being a
racial Other in an industry that funnels the cultural capital of white
beauty as the primary economic **capital** of its workers]{.underline}.
According to Angel Kelly (personal interview, 20 April 2003), 'Black
women are always feeling measured by white beauty standards, and
increasingly the skinny and plastic'. Indeed, [[many]{.mark} of the
professional adult [actresses]{.mark} I interviewed had [responded to
the pressure]{.mark} to look like ideal porn stars [by having]{.mark}
some form of [**plastic surgery**.]{.mark} The increasing employment of
black women [that look like]{.mark}]{.underline}, as black adult actor
Byron Long (personal interview, 10 January 2003) [puts it, 'chocolate
[Barbie dolls']{.mark},]{.underline} has meant that black women with
more voluptuous and natural bodies tend to be seen as less attractive,
more disposable and are marginalized in niche markets like ghetto porn,
BBW (Big Beautiful Women), and fat porn. They do not appear in higher
status hardcore feature films produced by the top companies and
directors. Those women who defy the politics of disposability and fight
for a longer career in the industry attempt to project what one
production executive calls 'crossover appeal'. According to professional
adult actress Sinnamon Love (personal interview, 5 December 2002), '[the
farther away they are from the natural, voluptuous figure of a black
woman, the better it is, and the more likely they are to get the
jobs'.]{.underline} [The process of [demanding black women appear white
while]{.mark} they are still [represented as **exotic** Others]{.mark}
[sustains the **fantasy** of difference for]{.mark}]{.underline}
presumably [[white male consumers]{.mark} without disrupting the racial
order. This systemic **hierarchy of valuation** shapes working
conditions and challenges the legitimacy of [black]{.mark} women [sex
workers]{.mark}. They [must work within]{.mark}]{.underline} limited
[categories]{.underline} defined and [regulated by [a racial **economy
of desire**]{.mark}]{.underline}; those that do not fit within the
categories are kept out with evasive excuses: 'We can't shoot you right
now, but as soon as we're shooting something, we'll call you'. This was
what an employer told performer Stacy Cash (personal interview, 10
January 2004) when she called to inquire about bookings. 'But if you
send in a picture of a girl that is lighter than you', she added, 'then
they'll shoot her. It depends on what their preferences are . . . you
have to work within the category that you are in'. Stacy is not alone in
experiencing the pain of rejection due to racism and colorism -- in fact
[she is part of a global economy of desire that uses, but also
discriminates against, black and brown women]{.underline}. Kemala
Kempadoo proposes we acknowledge that, 'even with the heightened
exoticization of the sexuality of Third World women and men, they are
positioned in the global sex industry second to white women' (Kempadoo
and Doezema, 1998: 11). [Whiteness is the hegemonic ideal of
**attractiveness and desirability**, Kempadoo argues, 'and white sexual
labor is most valued within the global sex industry']{.underline} (1998:
11).

**[Currently, endlessly circulated]{.underline} images of
[hypersexualized]{.underline} Black women [normalizes]{.underline} the
economy of sexual exchange which constructs the "[modern
Jezebel]{.underline}". In the US, this sexualization led to
[spikes]{.underline} in HIV rates and further commodification of young
Black women that forces resignation for income.**

[[The consequences of this]{.mark} sex-for-material-goods situation [can
be **tragic**.]{.mark} The **pressures** for young black women to engage
in [sex work have]{.mark} [affected the **rapid growth** of
HIV]{.mark}/AIDS [among poor black women]{.mark} in the Mississippi
Delta and across the rural South]{.underline}. [Between 1990 and 2000,
[Southern states]{.mark} with large African American populations
[experienced a **dramatic increase** in HIV infections among African
American women]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, [in Mississippi,
**28.5 percent** of those reporting new HIV infections in 2000 were
black women, up from **13 percent** in 1990. [In Alabama, the number
rose to **31 percent**, from 13 percent]{.mark}]{.underline}, whereas in
North Carolina, it rose to 27 percent, from 18 percent (Sack, 2001).
[Most of the women contracted HIV through heterosexual
contact]{.underline}, and most found out that they were HIV positive
when they became pregnant. The women took risks that may at first seem
nonsensical. Yet in the context of their lives [there was a sense that
[because they had]{.mark} so [**little control** over]{.mark} other
aspects of [their lives, they felt]{.mark} that [if God wanted them to
get AIDS, then they **resigned**]{.mark} themselves [to getting
it]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [These examples suggest]{.underline}]{.mark}
[that many young [African American women **resign**]{.mark} themselves
[to commodifying their bodies as a]{.mark} necessary [source of
**income**]{.mark}]{.underline}. They may not be streetwalkers in the
traditional sense, but [[they]{.mark} also [view]{.mark} commodified
[black sexuality as the **commodity** of value that they can
**exchange**]{.mark}]{.underline}. These relations also become difficult
to disrupt [in the context of a powerful [mass media]{.mark} that
defines and [**sells** images of sexualized black women as one
**icon**]{.mark} of seemingly authentic black culture. Young [African
American women encounter]{.mark}]{.underline} a set of [[representations
that]{.mark} **naturalizes and [normalize]{.mark}s** social relations of
[sex work]{.mark}]{.underline}. Whether [[she]{.underline}]{.mark}
sleeps with men for pleasure, drugs, revenge, or money, [the
**sexualized** bitch [constitutes a modern]{.mark} version of the
**[Jezebel]{.mark}**, repackaged for contemporary mass
media.]{.underline} In discussing this updated Jezebel image, cultural
critic Lisa Jones distinguishes between gold diggers/skeezers, namely,
women who screw for status, and crack 'hos', namely, women who screw for
a fix (1994: 79). Some women are the 'hos' who trade sexual favors for
jobs, money, drugs and other material items. [The female hustler, a
materialist woman who is willing to sell, rent, or use her sexuality to
get whatever she wants constitutes this sexualized variation of the
bitch]{.underline}. This image appears with increasing frequency,
especially in conjunction with trying to catch an African American man
with money. Athletes are targets, and having a baby with an athlete is a
way to garner income. Black women who are sex workers, namely, those who
engage in phone sex, lap dancing, and prostitution for compensation,
also populate this universe of sexualized bitches. The prostitute who
hustles without a pimp and who keeps the compensation is a bitch who
works for herself.

**Pornography provides a unique space in the field of [sexual
commerce]{.underline} to retain [autonomy, deviancy, and
respect]{.underline} for Black women.**

[Black women struggle to employ tactics of everyday
**survival**]{.underline} and labor [within the]{.underline} parameters
of a **[racialized sexual economy]{.underline}**, focusing on gaining
opportunities, mobility, and power by working within the system. There
are some entrepreneurial actresses that are also actively reforming
black women's traditional roles as sex workers by becoming hardcore
directors, producers, agents, and webmistresses. [[Using hardcore as a
space for **selffashioning**]{.mark} and self-promotion, [these]{.mark}
cultural [workers create their own]{.mark} [pornographies. Vanessa
Blue]{.mark}]{.underline}, who [learned filmmaking and built an editing
studio in her home by reading 'how-to' books, has [directed]{.mark} 20
[hardcore]{.mark} [videos]{.mark} and dozens of digital short films.
Vanessa is part of a **new emergence** of black women]{.underline}
[professional performers becoming directors]{.underline}, including
Diana Devoe, Sinnamon Love, and Marie Luv. In feature adult films like
Dark Confessions, Taking Memphis, and Black Reign, [[Vanessa creates
**representations**]{.mark} that attempt [to]{.mark} [highlight the
**erotic** **power**]{.mark} and beauty [of the women]{.mark} in the
images, [while sustaining an **ethical**]{.mark} working [environment
for sex workers]{.mark}, especially women]{.underline}. As a director,
Vanessa is adamant about paying her performers the rates they request
and never pressuring them to take on sex acts or situations they are
uncomfortable with[. [By]{.mark} [authoring]{.mark} illicit [erotic
texts that]{.mark} represent and [**reimagine** the desires]{.mark} and
fantasies [of black sexual subjects, Vanessa produces a space for black
eroticism **beyond** the framework of **stereotyped** black
sexuality]{.mark} dominant in traditional porn]{.underline}, such as in
My Baby Got Back, South Central Hookers and Ghetto Gaggers. Vanessa
(personal interview, 13 August 2008) asserts: 'I always loved porn and I
always wanted to make it and to be a part of it. I liked watching people
be free and enjoy themselves, and I liked shooting it. I always wanted
to be behind the camera . . . \[I thought to myself\] "Let me see if I
can become the director!"' [Vanessa Blue represents how [black women may
take up]{.mark} [pornography]{.mark}, and all its challenges,
[in]{.mark} fascinating and **[transformative]{.mark}** new [ways
for]{.mark} work, [identity formation]{.mark}, and **sexual
expression**. This]{.underline} essay focuses on black professional
adult entertainment actresses, but [has implications for other **sex
workers**, especially those marginalized and d isciplined by
pornography's **racial economy of desire**. [Because pornography's
hierarchies of value privilege]{.mark} a very narrow definition of
[**white** femininity]{.mark} as the object of the gaze, [women of color
work in]{.mark} peripheral and [**precarious** locations. Their
representations]{.mark} and experiences]{.underline} as sex workers
[[are shaped by a racialized]{.mark} and gendered [**sexual commerce**
where stereotypes]{.mark}]{.underline}, structural inequalities, [[and
**social biases** are the norm]{.underline}]{.mark}. As I described in
my field notes of the AVN Adult Expo and my research into discrimination
and bias in their work, [[black women are devalued as]{.mark}
**hyperaccessible and [superdisposable]{.mark}** []{.mark}in an industry
that simultaneously invests in and marginalizes fantasies about black
sexuality]{.underline}. As black women labor to make the presentation of
their presumed hypersexuality work for them, they face a myriad painful
choices and challenges. In light of feminist arguments that these women
are victimized by an alienating and exploitative sex industry, I have
attempted to show that [[black]{.mark} illicit [erotic workers,]{.mark}
while victimized by multiple axes of discrimination and harm, also
[employ an **outlaw sexuality** to achieve mobility, erotic autonomy,
and self-care]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} We should do more to shape
our studies so that they engage not just with the images that the
hardcore industry sells, but the women that are working hard to be seen
and heard. The informants in this study feel further alienated by
feminist scholars that talk about them, but not to them, and who see
them as colluding with misogynists rather than carving out a vital space
for black women to see themselves as desirable and desiring subjects.
[These women's **narratives** about and critiques of racism and sexism
in the sex industry are valuable to understanding their interventions as
performers and laborers to lay claim to legitimacy for all sex workers.
Taking on new roles as directors and producers, black women are agents
in a **transforming** sex industry. [By embracing the
**counternormative** work of deviance, hypersexuality, and
self-commodification]{.mark} in order [to survive]{.mark} under
capitalism, [they seek]{.mark} pleasure, [recognition, and
respect.]{.mark}]{.underline}

## **T -- Black Weapons**

### **[T -- Instrument of Terror]{.underline}**

#### **Living in the wake means living as a [weapon]{.underline}, an [excuse]{.underline} to legitimate and empower violence as terror's [embodiment]{.underline}. It is from this understanding of [weaponry]{.underline} that we use in addressing the topic.**

Wake: On Blackness and Being*) \\\\EG

If slavery persists as an issue in the political life of black America,
it is not because of an antiquarian obsession with bygone days or the
burden of a too-long memory, but because [black lives are **still
imperiled** and devalued by a racial calculus and a **political
arithmetic** that were entrenched centuries ago. [This is the
**afterlife** of slavery---skewed]{.mark} life [chances]{.mark}, limited
access to health and education, premature death, [**incarceration**, and
impoverishment]{.mark}.]{.underline} I, too, am the afterlife of
slavery. (Hartman 2007, 6) Living in/the wake of slavery is living "the
afterlife of property" and living the afterlife of partus sequitur
ventrem (that which is brought forth follows the womb), in which [[the
Black child inherits]{.mark} the non/status, [the **non/being** of the
mother]{.mark}.]{.underline} [That inheritance]{.underline} of a
non/status [is]{.underline} everywhere [apparent]{.underline} now [in
the **ongoing criminalization** of Black women and
children.]{.underline} [[Living in the wake]{.underline}]{.mark} on a
global level [[means living]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
**[disastrous]{.mark}**]{.underline} time and [effects of]{.underline}
continued [[marked migrations]{.underline}]{.mark}, Mediterranean and
Caribbean disasters, trans-American and -African migration, structural
adjustment [[imposed by the **I**]{.mark}**nternational
[M]{.mark}onetary [F]{.mark}und** that continues
imperialisms]{.underline}/colonialisms, and more. And here, in the
United States, [[it means]{.mark} living]{.underline} and dying through
the policies of the first US Black president; it means the gratuitous
violence of stop-and-frisk and Operation Clean Halls; rates of Black
incarceration that boggle the mind (Black people represent 60 percent of
the imprisoned population); [[the **immanence** of death as "a
**predictable and constitutive** aspect]{.mark} [of]{.mark} this
[democracy]{.mark}"]{.underline} (James and Costa Vargas 2012, 193,
emphasis mine). [[Living in the wake means]{.underline}]{.mark} living
the history and present of terror, from slavery to the present, as the
ground of our everyday Black existence; [living the]{.underline}
historically and geographically dis/continuous but always present and
[[endlessly **reinvigorated**]{.underline}
**[brutality]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in]{.underline},
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} on, [our bodies]{.underline} while even as
that terror is visited on our bodies the realities of that terror are
erased. Put another way, [living in the wake means [living in and with
**terror**]{.mark}]{.underline} in that in much of what passes for
public discourse about terror we, [[Black people, become the
**carriers** of terror, terror's **embodiment**]{.mark}, and not the
primary objects of terror's multiple enactments; [the ground of terror's
**possibility** globally.]{.mark}]{.underline} This is everywhere clear
as we think about those [[Black people]{.mark} in the United
States]{.underline} who [[can "**weaponize** sidewalks"]{.underline}
(**[Trayvon Martin]{.underline}**) [and **shoot themselves** while
handcuffed (Victor White III]{.underline}]{.mark}[, Chavis Carter, Jesus
Huerta, and more),]{.underline} those Black people transmigrating21 the
African continent toward the Mediterranean and then to Europe who are
imagined as insects, swarms, vectors of disease; [familiar [narratives
of danger and disaster]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[**attach** to]{.mark}
our [**always already weaponized** Black bodies (the **weapon is
blackness**).]{.mark}]{.underline} We must also, for example, think of
President Obama's former press secretary Robert Gibbs, who said,
commenting on the drone murder of sixteen-year-old US citizen
Abdulrahman Al-Alwaki, "I would suggest that you should have a far more
responsible father if you are truly concerned about the well being
\[sic\] of your children" (Grim 2012).22 We must consider this alongside
the tracking of Haitians and Dominicans of Haitian descent without
papers by drones in the midst of the ongoing ethnic cleansing in the
Dominican Republic.23 We must consider Gibbs's statement alongside
Barack Obama's reprimands of Black men in the United States, his
admonishing them to be responsible fathers. Consider, too, the
resurgence of narratives that Black people were better off in chattel
slavery. This is Black life in the wake; this is the flesh, these are
bodies, to which anything and everything can be and is done.

### T -- Wake of a Gun

#### **The Black condition is defined as an [instrument of conflict]{.underline}, in the recoil of [gunshots]{.underline}, as a relegating force which is [attached]{.underline} to metaphors of [weaponization]{.underline} and militarism.**

**Sharpe '16** (Christina Sharpe, Professor at York University, Sharpe
is a scholar of English literature and Black Studies, 2016, *In the
Wake: On Blackness and Being*) \\\\EG

A reprise and an elaboration: [Wakes are **processes**; through them we
think about the dead and about our relations to them; they are rituals
through which to enact grief and memory.]{.underline} Wakes allow those
among the living to mourn the passing of the dead through ritual; they
are the watching of relatives and friends beside the body of the
deceased from death to burial and the accompanying drinking, feasting,
and other observances, a watching practiced as a religious observance.
[But [wakes are]{.mark} also "[the **track** left]{.mark} on the water's
surface [by a ship]{.mark} (figure 1.4); the **disturbance** caused by a
body swimming, or one that is moved, in water; the air currents behind a
body in flight; [a region of **disturbed flow**; in the **line of sight
of**]{.mark} (an observed object); [and]{.mark} (something) [in the line
of **recoil of (a gun)";**]{.mark}]{.underline} finally, wake means
being awake and, also, consciousness. [[In the wake, the semiotics of
the slave ship **continue**: from]{.mark} the [forced movements of the
enslaved to]{.mark} the forced movements [of the migrant]{.mark} and the
refugee, [to the **regulation** of Black people in]{.mark} North
[American]{.mark} streets and [neighborhoods]{.mark}]{.underline}, to
those ongoing crossings of and drownings in the Mediterranean Sea, [[to
the]{.mark} brutal **colonial reimaginings** of the slave ship and the
ark; to the [reappearances of the slave ship in **everyday**]{.mark}
[**life** in]{.mark} the form of [the prison]{.mark}, the camp, and the
school.]{.underline} As we go about wake work, we must [[think through
containment]{.mark}, regulation, **[punishment]{.mark}**, capture, and
captivity [and the ways]{.mark} the manifold representations of
[blackness become]{.mark} the symbol, par excellence, for the
**[less-than-human]{.mark}** being condemned to death.]{.underline} [We
must [think about Black flesh,]{.mark} Black optics, and ways of
producing enfleshed work; think [the ways]{.mark} the hold cannot and
does not hold even as [the hold remains in]{.mark} the form of the
semiotics of the slave ship hold, the prison, the womb, and elsewhere in
and as [the tension between being and **instrumentality** that is Black
being in the **wake**.]{.mark}]{.underline} At stake is not recognizing
antiblackness as total climate. At stake, too, is not recognizing an
insistent Black visualsonic resistance to that imposition of non/being.
How might we stay in the wake with and as those whom the state positions
to die ungrievable deaths and live lives meant to be unlivable? These
are questions of temporality, the longue durée, the residence and hold
time of the wake. At stake, then is to stay in this wake time toward
inhabiting a blackened consciousness that would rupture the structural
silences produced and facilitated by, and that produce and facilitate,
Black social and physical death.

### T -- Sheer Potentiality

#### Blackness is a site of [sheer potentiality]{.underline}, an [impending terror]{.underline} birthed through the Middle Passage which is tied to the nature of [threats]{.underline}. 

**Sharpe '16** (Christina Sharpe, Professor at York University, Sharpe
is a scholar of English literature and Black Studies, 2016, *In the
Wake: On Blackness and Being*) \\\\EG

With these logics in mind, I want to suggest that [[what is]{.mark} also
being [birthed is]{.mark} what I call [**anagrammatical** blackness that
exists as an **index** of]{.mark} violability and also
**[potentiality]{.mark}**.]{.underline} J. Kameron Carter (2013, 593)
gets at something like this when in "Thinking with Spillers" he writes
that the " 'passage,' [then, in 'Middle Passage' is **sheer possibility
and potentiality**, while [the 'middle' in 'Middle Passage' is]{.mark} .
. .---[**existence in the middle** itself]{.mark}]{.underline}." As I
continue to think with Spillers's grammar, "which is really a rupture
and a radically different kind of cultural continuation" (Spillers
2003b, 209), and Fred Moten's opening sentences in In the Break, that
"the history of blackness is testament to the fact that objects can and
do resist" and "blackness---the extended movement of a specific
upheaval, an ongoing irruption that anarranges every line---is a strain
that pressures the assumption of the equivalence of personhood and
subjectivity" (Moten 2003, 1), I arrive at blackness as, [[blackness is,
anagrammatical]{.underline}]{.mark}. That is, [we can see the moments
[when]{.mark} blackness]{.underline} opens up into the anagrammatical in
the literal sense [[as]{.mark} when ["a word]{.mark}, phrase, or name
[is formed by **rearranging** the letters]{.mark} of
another"]{.underline} (Merriam-Webster Online). We can also apprehend
this in the metaphorical sense in how, r[egarding blackness, grammatical
[**gender** falls away and **new meanings** proliferate; how "the
letters]{.mark} of a text are [form]{.mark}ed [into a secret
message]{.mark} by rearranging them" or a secret message is discovered
through the rearranging of the letters of a text.]{.underline} Ana-, as
a prefix, means "up, in place or time, back, again, anew."11 So,
blackness anew, blackness as a/temporal, in and out of place and time
putting pressure on meaning and that against which meaning is made. [[We
see again and again how]{.underline}]{.mark}, in and out of the United
States (as my point of departure and arrival), [[girl doesn't mean
"girl" but]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example, [["**prostitute**"]{.mark}
or "felon,"12 [boy doesn't mean "boy," but]{.mark} "Hulk Hogan" or
"**[gunman]{.mark}**," "thug" or "urban youth."]{.underline}13 We see
that [[mother doesn't mean "mother," but]{.mark} "felon" and "defender"
and/or "**[birther of terror]{.mark}**"]{.underline} and not one of the
principal grounds of terrors multiple and quotidian enactments.14 We see
that child is not "child," and a Coast Guard cutter becomes, in
Brathwaite's hands, a Coast Guard gutter---not a rescue or a medical
ship but a carrier of coffins, a coffle, and so on.15 As the meanings of
words fall apart, we encounter again and again the difficulty of
sticking the signification. This is Black being in the wake. This is the
anagrammatical. These are Black lives, annotated. (I will return to what
I am calling Black annotation in the final section of this work, "The
Weather.")

### T -- Muting and Over-Dubbing

#### Can you [hear]{.underline} a shadow? In an antiblack world, Black suffering becomes [muted and overdubbed]{.underline} as the [weaponizing and legitimizing]{.underline} force of violence.

**Brady '12** (Nicholas Brady, Graduate student from UC Irvine, 11
October 2012, "Louder Than the Dark: Toward an Acoustics of Suffering",

\\\\EG

[[Can you hear a **shadow**?]{.mark}]{.underline} The more enlightened,
the deeper the shadows, but can the shadow enunciate the depth of its
sorrow back to the world it is invariably bound to? [A **silhouette** is
wheeled to the corner of a hallway]{.underline}, its face obscured. The
nurse has demanded that she leave the hospital. Unbeknownst to the
shadow, [the police]{.underline} happen to be in the building at the
same time and are asked to remove her from the premises. They [drag her
out of the wheelchair and **handcuff** her, leaving her slouched on the
ground. A few more cops come and they cart her away to literally rot in
a **jail** cell. [The shadow's name is **Anna Brown**.]{.mark} She has
also been named "the homeless lady," as well as **"the
crackhead"**]{.underline} or "drug sick" individual by the officers that
arrested her. She went to the hospital after spraining her ankle, was
arrested because she refused to leave due to continued pain, and was
found dead on the prison floor because her sprain produced blood clots
that lodged into her lungs. Due to medical malpractice and the police
officers' violence, [Anna passed away alone on the floor of a prison
cell]{.underline}. Yet, that last sentence was entirely too nice, for in
truth [[Anna]{.mark} Brown [was **murdered**.]{.mark}]{.underline} The
hesitation to describe this as a "murder" is because that implies an
event, a narrative, a "when," "where," and "who" (as in "who done it?").
Yet this was not an event with an acting subject; [she was instead
murdered [by **subjectivity** itself: a series of incidents]{.mark}
centered on her body, [each reverberating off each other into an
**orchestra of death**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Each proceeding was an echo
of the one preceding it: [waves of suffering reflecting off each action
through time. [Her death was caused by the **incoherence** of her
voice]{.mark}, her calls for care, [her **screams of
agony**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Put another way, she was murdered by civil
society's inability---and lack of desire---to hear her being. Discourse
on race normally focuses on the material and the visual, but the video
of Anna Brown's death points us less to the images and more to the
centrality of aurality to black suffering. The first part of the video
is without audio, but this does not mean sound is absent per se. That
the video lacks audio in the beginning says more than perhaps the
soundtrack itself could, for it makes explicit the [**inaudibility** of
black suffering. We know that [Anna]{.mark} Brown had [expressed
her]{.mark} lasting [pain, in spite of the doctor's opinion that she was
fine.]{.mark} The hospital then ordered her to leave and she protested,
saying that she was still in pain. [She was **forcibly** wheeled to the
hallway and]{.mark} eventually **[arrested]{.mark}** by the police.
[Her]{.mark} vocal [protests]{.mark}, critiques [of inadequate service
and expression of her persistent pain, fell on **deaf ears.** She
spoke]{.mark} the knowledge of her body, [but her voice was **muted and
over-dubbed** by the]{.mark} knowledge of the
[professionals.]{.mark}]{.underline} How can the black know about
itself? [How can the shadow speak back?]{.underline} The violence that
produces the subject (in this case, the doctor) robs Anna Brown of
vocality, not so much literally as ontologically. Insofar as an object
(a commodity, a slave) can speak, it cannot be said that it can
communicate. At the etymological root of "communicate" is the logic of
the commons or community: informing to participate in the world, sharing
one's utterance(s) to join the community.
[[Communication]{.underline}]{.mark}, not even to imply anything as
serious as the ethics of dialogue, [[requires an **equal** ontological
status amongst the communicators]{.mark}.]{.underline} That several
titles of the video online have called her the "homeless woman"
evidences one singular truth (the desire to insult her notwithstanding):
[Anna Brown, as the descendent of slaves, has no home while the doctors
are in their own dominion.]{.underline} In a public lecture titled
"People-of-Color-Blindness," Jared Sexton describes an experience at a
jazz club where the microphones go off, but the band continues to play.
Even though the sociality between the band and the audience has been
shut down, the band still plays on. Sexton uses this example to
dramatize how even though the black is socially dead, that does not
signify that black life is non-existent. Instead, our social death
signifies that black life is sealed off from the world and happens
elsewhere: "underground or in outer space." [In this way [Anna speaks,
but the microphone that would project her subjectivity to the world has
been turned off. Her suffering has been **rendered unreal** while her
voice is heard as incoherent and **dangerous**.]{.mark}]{.underline} If
Anna Brown's suffering is inaudible, the second half of the video speaks
to how [her voice and pain are criminalized.]{.underline} When [the
police]{.underline} arrive, they [surround Anna and then drag her out of
the wheelchair, handcuff her, and leave her on the hospital
floor.]{.underline} She is given two different charges: [[her protests
for better service are charged as "**trespassing**" and her inability to
walk due to her injury is charged as]{.mark} ["**resisting
arrest**."]{.mark}]{.underline} When she is in the police car, the
camera in the vehicle has a microphone. When they arrive at the prison,
Anna continues to tell them she can't walk and that she needs to be in a
hospital. [The police officers ignore her statements and instead
oscillate between asking her "are you going to get out" and threatening
her; "you have two seconds to \[swing your legs out\]..."]{.underline}
Each implies that she can move her legs and she is choosing not to. As
Saidiya Hartman writes in Scenes of Subjection, "the slave was
recognized as a reasoning subject who possessed intent and rationality
solely in the context of criminal liability." [[Her suffering remains
**inaudible**, but her voice can only be heard]{.mark} by the police [as
**challenging the law**, resisting arrest]{.mark}, disrespecting their
authority; her voice can only be heard [as a **legitimizing** force for
their violence.]{.mark} As they drag her out of the car, she screams out
in pain before the door is shut and her voice becomes
muffled.]{.underline}

### T -- Tool of Innocence

#### Blackness is the tool of civil society to [avoid blame]{.underline} for everything it [fucks up]{.underline}.

**Warren '18** (Calvin Warren, Calvin Warren is an Assistant Professor

This lack of properness and metaphysical truth is a symptom of the
nothing, for nothing lacks any proper place in metaphysics and cannot be
understood through its episteme. [Black being as nothing]{.underline},
then, [will always be out of place and **improper**]{.underline} [in an
antiblack world.]{.underline} It is the terror of the metaphysical
infrastructure, and one can never be a true or proper man when one bears
the weight of nothing. Through this analysis, we can understand the
anxiety concerning black being, placement, and nothing in antebellum
culture. In August 1842, for example, the free black population of
Philadelphia held a parade commemorating the abolition of slavery in the
West Indies. [[A]{.mark}n angry [mob of white citizens]{.mark} disrupted
the parade, [attacked]{.mark} participants, and commenced to **destroy**
[black homes and property. Seeking redress through the
**courts**]{.mark} for loss of property and injury, [the]{.mark} free
[black]{.mark} population [realized]{.mark} that [justice]{.mark} within
such a context [was impossible, as the]{.mark} grand [jury acquitted the
rioters and **blamed**]{.mark} free [blacks for **inciting** this
violence.]{.mark}]{.underline} Robert Purvis, a leader in the free black
population of Philadelphia, responded to the grand jury's decision with
dismay:49 "The measure of our suffering is full. . . . From the most
painful and minute investigation, in the feelings, views and acts of
this community --- in regard to us --- I am convinced of our utter and
complete nothingness in public estimation \[emphasis mine\]."50 What
sparked the riot, this devastating expression of antiblackness? We can
locate this eruption of violence at the metaphysical fault line between
necessity and hatred. [[Black being is]{.mark} both [a **necessary
instrument** for]{.mark} the human's self-constitution and an object of
**ferocious [hatred]{.mark}**[, since it bears the nothing of a
metaphysical]{.mark} [order]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words, the
riot is the symptom of a metaphysical problem: the public celebration of
black freedom sparks a terror in that ontological boundaries are
challenged and the transformation from black being, as
invention/instrument, to human being, as free, is not only considered
but celebrated. [It is also no surprise that the grand jury **blamed**
the victims for the riot, since [black freedom is a form of **violence**
for the human]{.mark}, a violence [that must be **met with**]{.mark}
extreme [force. The riot is a response to ontological terror.]{.mark}
"Free," when paired with ["black," is recast as a **weapon** against the
human]{.mark} and the metaphysical structure that sustains the
human.]{.underline} We are dealing with two registers of violence ---
one is an ontological violence and another is a physical form of
antiblack destruction. But Purvis's response to the violence is
perspicuous. He is "convinced of our utter and complete nothingness in
public estimation." If we read this statement as a mere political
lamentation, that blacks constitute a political cypher (nothingness)
within the law and political processes, then we limit our understanding
of the riot as event. The riot, within this reading, is just a form of
cruelty or irrational intolerance or a political-economic strategy of
subjection. With political readings of antiblack violence, violence is
not gratuitous but must be linked to some type of recognizable
transgression; when antiblack violence cannot be linked to recognizable
transgression, it is considered cruel or irrational --- a form of
individual pathology and not systemic necessity. If, however, the
essence of politics is nothing political, then we might read Purvis's
political commentary as a response to the proper metaphysical question.
His answer is that [black being is **nothingness** in public
estimation.]{.underline} We can understand nothingness as the condition
(-ness) of bearing nothing in an antiblack world. Antiblack violence,
then, constitutes the structure of this nothing. [[Black being is always
already under **attack**]{.mark}; peace, within an antiblack world, is a
fallacy (much like freedom).]{.underline} The metaphysical
infrastructure that supports the fiction of the white human is sustained
by antiblack violence. [The riot is an **ontological necessity**, not
just political cruelty.]{.underline} We can understand the grand jury's
decision philosophically: [[Being black is both the **cause** and effect
of violence]{.mark}, and when this being claims freedom, extreme
violence is always justified and necessary.]{.underline}

In Capital's chapter on the commodity Karl Marx argues that [a man-made
thing appears as a **commodity** when it is subject to
**exchange**.]{.underline} Later, in the passage of the so-called
"Dancing Table," which has been tremendously influential in theories of
fetishism,1 Marx describes the seeming 'transformation' of a mundane and
unproblematic sensuous object, such as a table, into a commodity. [[The
commodity]{.mark}, he writes, [is]{.mark} something [**supra-sensible**,
something beyond]{.mark} the table's tangible
**[materiality]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Among other things, the passage
addresses the way in which the concept of 'form' (in this case the
'commodity form' -- the fact that, when coming forth as object of
exchange, the table assumes the form of a commodity) emerges as a
principle of visibility: there is form when something appears as
something else. [The table doesn't change: it still has four legs, a
top, and it is still made of wood. But [what changes is the way it
exists in the **social space**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[No longer simply
a use value]{.mark},]{.underline} i.e. an object that is valued because
of the use that it can be put to, [[but an **exchange** value as
well]{.underline}]{.mark}.2 What interests me is that [Marx established
that [the commodity]{.mark} as such [is not a thing, but]{.mark} rather
[a **form**, a way of **being**]{.mark}, an appearance, the
**expression** of the thing's ability to exchange.]{.underline} This is
important because [[blackness has a very **intimate** relationship
with]{.mark} the [commodity]{.mark} form]{.underline}, one
[[rooted]{.underline} [in **slavery**]{.underline}]{.mark} of course,3
[but surviving [also in the way blackness has continued to **circulate**
in popular]{.mark}]{.underline} and visual
[[culture]{.underline}]{.mark}.4 This relationship, in other words, is
all but new and yet, what I think needs more attention is the concept of
form understood, in the Marxian sense, as a principle of visibility; as
the appearance of something---both in the sense of its 'coming into
visibility' and in the sense of the way something looks. Thus this essay
asks: when does the commodity black become visible as such? Or, more
precisely, what type of commodity is the one for which blackness acts as
principle of visibility?5 To pursue these questions this essay does not
concern itself with cinematic portrayals of blackness, i.e. it is not
about [blackness as a visual object in search of adequate
representation, but rather about blackness as a **language** and a
principle of **visualization**.]{.underline} This is so because I am
convinced that [[blackness---a]{.mark} most [carnal]{.mark} and at the
same time most [abstract **visual property**]{.mark}---can shed light
onto the contemporary **ontology of the visual**]{.underline}; it can
teach us something about the way in which we live with, understand, and
use, images. Race, in fact, continues to provide the most enduring
template for what constitutes a visible sign. My methodological premise
lies in something that Benjamin said about prostitution and that Stephen
Best has argued characterizes slavery even more, which is the fact that
the commodity celebrates its becoming human in the slave, in the attempt
to look at itself in the face.6 [The idea is that there is something to
be gained by looking not only at what happens to the concept of the
person when it can be commodified but also, conversely, at [what happens
to]{.mark} the concept of [the **commodity** when the **black**]{.mark}
**slave** [is counted as one.]{.mark}]{.underline}7 Therefore my
emphasis on the form of the commodity attempts to get at precisely this:
the way in which, in our contemporary moment, '[[black' gives
**form**]{.mark}---i.e. **appearance and visibility**---[to commodity
status.]{.mark}]{.underline} This also explains not only what set of
visual materials I focus on to begin to answer the questions posed by
this essay, but also how I look at them: not so much for what they show,
but for what face they put on, what sits on their surface, as it were,
what they wear on their sleeves. That blackness and whiteness are
distinct from black and white people is increasingly accepted today as
is the overwhelming self-referentiality of the images circulating in our
contemporary visual culture. And yet, racial images (and what
constitutes a 'racial image' is another concept that this essay puts
into play) are still affected by what in a literary context Henry Louis
Gates defined as a naturalist fallacy, i.e. the expectation that visual
signifiers of race are responsible for faithfully and authentically
representing 'black people,' rather than social relations.8 In other
words, visual signifiers of race are still taken at face value. Hence my
emphasis on form, appearance, surface, and face. Especially face, which,
as Kimberly Lamm suggests, is "an image suspended between the concept of
race and the physicality of the body."9 I begin with Spike Lee's film
Bamboozled because its use of blackface makes an explicit demand to
seriously engage with the film's surfaces. Blackface, in fact, is a very
specific kind of racial image, one created by the application of a
man-made signifier on top of the face: a black coating that functions as
the subject's interface. Blackface is obviously not a naturalistic
sign---it does not resemble anything or anyone---but rather a
second-degree signifier of race: it is an image of blackness as image of
race. Its referent is not black people, but the epidermality of race, in
other words, the fact that race's scopic regime is built on the
blackness of the skin. Through this leverage that the film employs
literally at the level of the plot, and metaphorically as a trope of the
relations of exploitation and commodification of blackness in the
entertainment industry, [Bamboozled argues that [the commodity]{.mark}
form [in contemporary]{.mark} material [culture has a face, and that
face is **black**.]{.mark} This is [because material culture is **still
determined** by]{.mark} the [commodity relations of **slavery**.
Bamboozled presents slavery]{.mark}, as Bill Brown puts it, not as a
historical phenomenon---a historical event that, occurred in the past
and has attained its closure---but rather [as]{.mark} a [**historical
ontology**,]{.mark} i.e. [an enduring **systemic**]{.mark} breakdown of
the [**distinction** between humans and things]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### The [modern whip is the Nike Logo]{.underline}---Blackness is intimately [tied]{.underline} to spheres of commodification and [exchange]{.underline} as a racial index of [valuation]{.underline}.

The Liberty Paint episode stages assimilation as the production of
whiteness via incorporation of the raw materials of blackness in a
manner that erases the traces of this very process. Lucius Browkway is a
ghost in the machine: he is an enabling black presence that augments a
white color capital. But whereas in Ellison, as per Harryette Mullen's
persuasive reading[, [whiteness is **manufactured** through]{.mark}
processes of **assimilation** dependent on black
invisibility]{.underline}, Lhamon's starting point is the contribution
to whiteness performed by the [[excessive **visibility** of blackness,
and their endorsement of such visibility]{.mark} in order [to display
their **refusal**]{.mark} to fit.]{.underline} Optic black, in other
words, is performative and deliberately exhibitionist.22 [What is [at
stake]{.mark}, then, [is]{.mark}]{.underline} not simply the performance
of demeaning images for purposes of subversion---what is often referred
to as the 'reversal of the stereotype' or, as Manthia Diawara,
commenting on the art of Michael Ray Charles, Kara Walker, and David
Levinthal puts it, the 'desire for' the stereotype23---but rather [[a
shift in the **location** of blackness from]{.mark} the sphere of
[**production** to]{.mark} the sphere of
**[exhibition]{.mark}**.]{.underline} While Ellison indicts a cultural
optics that spectralizes black labor for the production of a white color
capital, [the notion of **optic black**, instead, calls attention to the
fact that [blackness]{.mark} has become a visual signifier which
[becomes more **valuable** the more it is **removed** from]{.mark} the
sphere of [production. Blackness **severs** its connection to]{.mark}
black [labor, but once liberated]{.mark} from it[, acts]{.mark} instead
[as **currency** in the sphere of exchange.]{.mark}]{.underline} In this
respect, Bamboozled's great achievement is showing how [[blackness
**migrates** from]{.mark} the surface of [the body to]{.mark} the
surface of [**commodity culture** and beyond]{.mark} this [to]{.mark}
the vocabulary of [**capitalist** realism]{.mark},]{.underline} where
commodity culture attempts to look at itself in the face. The work of
Hank Willis Thomas claims a similar place for blackness. His photographs
are generally crafted to reproduce not only the aesthetic, but also the
intermediate plane of capitalist realism, slipping in and around our
consciousness just as advertising does, so that their commonplace
appearance, argues Rene de Guzman, "gives them the kind of legitimacy
accorded to things existing in the natural world." [This means that his
works' ontological claim to the real is dependent both on their ability
to **camouflage** as actual advertising and on sharing advertising's
**cumulative** effect]{.underline}---the insistence with which it
clutters our visual landscape.24 This is the case in a pseudo Master
Card ad (Fig. 6) crafted around the photograph of the funeral of
Thomas's cousin Songha Willis Thomas, inexplicably shot dead by another
black man who had just stolen his gold chain. Built and publicly hung as
a billboard, this image's deceptive face, fully compliant with the
aesthetics of other 'priceless' Master Card ads, encourages a distracted
reception, while the superimposed text quietly, but sternly, demands
that the viewer conjures up the horrible loss that lies beneath it. For
his UNBRANDED series25 Willis Thomas collected a number of print
advertisements from 1968 to 2008 featuring African American models or
directed at black consumers, and digitally removed their captions. The
goal was to show how blackness functions as a language through which
capitalist realism enables material relations to be rendered and
resolved as visual relations. Stripping these images of their
advertising text reveals the underlying work and trajectories of
desires. (Fig. 7) The fantasy structure that sustains the unholy
marriage between race and consumption comes to the surface and makes
black bodies appear central to the signification of capitalism,
sometimes simply as items within a color palette and other times as part
of a wish fulfillment (Fig. 8)---vital ingredients to the reproduction
and reaffirmation of a color capital that remains optic white.26 The
UNBRANDED series further superficializes a language that is already
entirely focused on its outer appearance and, just like blackface, has
no referent outside of its own economy of desire. In his earlier B®ANDED
series, instead, Hank Willis Thomas specifically interrogates the
[relationship of advertising images to [the visual archives of
slavery]{.mark}, which he **[re-animates]{.mark}** from within [the
icons of]{.mark} **contemporary** [**consumer**
culture]{.mark}]{.underline} (Fig. 9). As Robin Kelley puts it, Willis
Thomas is not interested "in blackface imagery; he draws on the archives
of slavery itself, which he then links to contemporary representations
of black men. Nor is he interested in artifice. What makes his work
resonate so powerfully is his ability to plumb the archives without
stripping the object/artifacts/texts of their historical moorings."27
[Of vital important to his project is the choice of the photographic
medium, which he employs in a historical perspective in order to both
reanimate and disrupt its role in naturalizing the **visuality of
race**]{.underline}.28 His work superficializes photography as well, in
order to dispute the way in which, [[historically and semiotically, the
photographic effect has come to **reinforce** the racial
effect]{.underline}]{.mark} -- the fact that as the photographic image
is conceived as a trace of the object before the camera (an index,
semiotically speaking) so black skin is read as a trace of 'race'.29 In
the B®ANDED series one has the sense that [[photography and race
are]{.mark} equally handled as a **[second skin]{.mark}**: none of them
is natural, but [both have been]{.mark} naturalized and [made to
**adhere** to the body]{.mark}.]{.underline} For Willis Thomas, in other
words, [[race is a form of]{.mark} political and [**economic
domination** that]{.mark} has become [incarnate]{.mark}d [in]{.mark} the
sense of [acquiring]{.mark} a [social]{.mark} (rather than biological)
**[materiality]{.mark}**]{.underline}.30 Hence he renders the enduring
ontology of slavery as a trace, which has and continues to visibly mark
the body---branding it, in fact. Scarred Chest, (Fig. 10) recapitulates
two very different but still connected iconographic traditions: on the
one hand Mapplethorpe's erotica then co-opted within an advertising
frame in Annie Leibovitz' photo of Dennis Rodman; on the other hand, the
abolitionist icon The Scourged Back -- an image widely circulated
because of its ability to index the brutality of slavery.31 [By
[substituting the whipping marks with the **Nike logo**]{.mark}, Willis
Thomas [constructs blackness]{.mark} and commodity culture [as]{.mark}
two competing [inscription]{.mark}s [of **value** onto the
body]{.mark}.]{.underline} The key concept being that [they are both
inscriptions -- iconic projections of a **socio-material**
**arrangement**]{.underline}, not intrinsic properties of the object.
[An image where race appears equally constructed by the blackness of the
skin and the branding of the brand foregrounds the ability of race to
'**attach'** itself to the body]{.underline}. By reanimating the
properly structure of slavery still contained within the contemporary
commerce of blackness as [[the]{.mark} primary form of [racial
index]{.mark}ing]{.underline} -- indeed by setting up against each other
photographic and epidermal indexicality -- Willis Thomas disrupts the
coincidence between photographic and racial index. In peeling one off
from the other, and inserting icons of consumer culture in their middle
(Fig. 11 B®ANDED "Absolut") he simultaneously challenges photography's
own reliance on its own face value. [In his work it is the commodity
form that takes the semblance of the index: it [brands,]{.mark} it
[acquires]{.mark} its own [**corporeality**, and]{.mark}, acting like a
second skin, it [becomes]{.mark} face [**value**.]{.mark}]{.underline}32

#### Around the globe, Blackness is [sold]{.underline} in the [marketplace]{.underline} of desire---a world of [social anxiety]{.underline} and anti-black [exchange]{.underline}. Marked with a [phantasmatic price-tag]{.underline}, Blackness operates as a cultural and social [icon]{.underline} which [powers]{.underline} civil society.

\\\\EG

But what happens when there is no face to speak of? When blackness is no
longer available as a visual object? As Harry Elam comments, the
increased visibility of [[blackness]{.underline}]{.mark}
[in]{.underline} [contemporary]{.underline} visual and [material
culture]{.underline} paradoxically [attests to a new and
**de-materialized** way in]{.underline} [which it [functions---as an
agent of **abstraction**.]{.mark} Blackness]{.underline}, in other
words, [seems [to **circulate** on its own]{.mark}, quite apart from
black bodies]{.underline} and consequently, from the history of black
people as well. In order to explore what guarantees this circulation, a
good number of artists (both black and 'postblack'33) have interrogated
this new stage of the commodity form of race by exposing its rules of
legibility in scenarios deprived of visual objects. I am thinking, for
example, about [conceptual cyber art such as damali ayo's
**rent-a-negro.com**]{.underline}, a website where it is seemingly
possible to rent a well-mannered African-American woman to be
accompanied at social events or simply to increase one's reputation; or
[Keith [Obadike's Blackness for Sale.]{.mark} The latter artwork [is
an]{.mark} ebay [**auction** of the artist's
blackness]{.mark}]{.underline}. In his product description, Obadike
claims, among other things, that [[the 'blackness' he is selling can be
used to create black **art**]{.mark},]{.underline} but not serious art;
it can be used to say the N-word without repercussions, but it is not
recommended while seeking justice or employment. [[It offers 'cool,' but
not fairness.]{.mark} Following [the rules of]{.mark}]{.underline}
engagement of [[the **marketplace**]{.mark} allows Obadike to [describe
the commodity blackness in its contemporary form]{.mark}, that is, [as a
**phantasmatic** entity]{.mark}---[valued for what it enables, both
discursively and socially.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Obadike
exposes]{.mark} a number of [factors that determine]{.mark} the variable
[**value** of blackness and offers to sell]{.mark}]{.underline}, just
like damali ayo, not what blackness is, but what it does. In these works
blackness does not pre-exist the act of exchange, but rather, [[it
exists as the **manufactured** product of a
transaction]{.underline}]{.mark} that the works themselves initiate.
Consequently, the works expose that racial identity is not lodged in a
pre-existing essence, but [it is rather reconfigured as a number of
possible subject positions in response to the art itself.34
[Blackness]{.mark}, then, [emerges as a structuring principle and a
**language** of social relations.]{.mark}]{.underline} By being openly
set forth in the form of a commodity, it offers, as Marx explains in his
opening chapter of Capital, the best vantage point on the capitalist
system as a whole. Blackness for Sale brings to the surface another
important sense in which the index speaks to the value of blackness, a
value that has become independent from its visual presence. In fact,
[Obadike's goal was to test the value of blackness in a **commercial
context**]{.underline} shared precisely with cookie jars and darkies
posters, but by withholding any image and just allowing consumers to
fantasize as to what blackness would mean to them: "many people" he
claims, "understand blackness as something that lives in the realm of
vision and because there was no photo on the auction page it gave room
for some to fantasize about how they would occupy this space."35 And
yet, [[blackness]{.underline}]{.mark} still [[functions]{.underline} [as
a principle of]{.underline}]{.mark} visualization,36 partly because it
operates in the context of what Michael Kaplan has [called
['**iconomics**:' the way]{.mark} in which [a **market index** measures
value]{.mark} as well as indicates the status of the system by providing
an image of the investors' feelings about it]{.underline}.37 In fact,
the market index is determined by, but also reflective of, the
collective opinion of the market participants: each investor speculates
about what others might be speculating about. Consequently, as a social
imaginary, iconomics is a system of simulation, whose only referent is
the feelings that people have about the system itself. Similarly, even
though it does not unfold through visual means, [[Obadike's art]{.mark}
work [functions **pictorially**, as an indexical
icon]{.mark}]{.underline}, because [it]{.underline} provides a picture
of a system that, having to face its own desires, is caught in the act
of looking at itself in the face. What artists such as Obadike and
damaly ayo show, according to Harry Elam, is that [blackness has reached
a new level of **abstraction** and it can now "travel on its own,
separate and distinct from black people." [Blackness]{.mark}, he argues,
[has acquired the status of **currency**: "blackness functions as
something]{.mark} that [you can]{.mark} apply, [put on, wear]{.mark},
that you use to assuage **social anxiety** and perceived threat: [the
desire to be included without]{.mark} the necessity of [**including**
black folk."]{.mark}]{.underline} The problem, Elam specifies, is that
"[it remains]{.underline} exceedingly [attractive]{.underline} and
possible in this post-black, postsoul age of black cultural traffic [[to
love black cool and not love black people.]{.underline}]{.mark}38 [The
fact that blackness can be made '**detachable'** from black
bodies]{.underline} -- where it was made to adhere by what had been
constructed as its natural, ontological, visuality -- [is an indication
of a new phase of development of the **commodity** form]{.underline},
what I will call blackness as phantasmagoria, i.e. the stage in which an
increasingly simulacral status of the visual develops its own,
[independent, social-materiality]{.underline}.39 The phantasmagoria was
a pre-cinematic device comprising a fully darkened room with a 'magic
lantern' placed behind a screen so that the screen and the apparatus
would be concealed from view; the audience only saw floating images
without anchorage in any specific place. This detachment of the visual
from the material is what Marx found useful to describe commodity
fetishism and what Benjamin relied on to articulate his notion of
exhibition value. However, as Tom Gunning points out, because the
phantasmagoria is based on a conscious deception of the senses, it
contains the possibility for its own de-mystification. [I introduce the
concept of **phantasmagoria** here because I believe it can offer
critical tools to [understand how blackness has transitioned]{.mark}
[from]{.mark} being [a bodily index to a **market index**; from]{.mark}
being the signifier of a [corporeal property to]{.mark} being the
signifier of [**speculative value**.]{.mark}]{.underline} It suggests
that blackness might be the signifier for the current ontology of the
image, one in which an increasingly simulacral status of the visual has
developed its own, independent, social-materiality. Finally, it allows
us to understand the current moment as another phase [in the journey of
blackness from the surface of the body, to the surface of material
culture]{.underline} [to]{.underline} where it is now---on [the surface
of the visual.]{.underline}

Complementing the traditional focus on production with greater attention
to [the growing significance of **consumption** within [global
**capitalism** provides new]{.mark} [directions for
understanding]{.mark} the experiences of [African American
youth]{.mark}.]{.underline} Black American youth are far from
marginalized [[within]{.underline} [a]{.underline}]{.mark} [massive
[global black]{.mark} [culture industry that uses their images to
**sell**]{.mark} a wide array of products]{.underline}. Moreover, [black
American youth]{.underline} also [constitute a **consumer
market**]{.underline} of their own [who will purchase music, alcohol,
drugs, cell phones]{.underline}, gym shoes, their own images [and other
products that are **created** **specifically** for them. [African
American youth are]{.mark}]{.underline} not marginalized but rather
remain [essential to new [consumer markets, both as
**suppliers**]{.mark}]{.underline} of commodities that are bought and
sold, [[and]{.mark} as reliable [consumer]{.mark} markets.]{.underline}
[African American youth are a **hot commodity** in the]{.underline}
contemporary [global]{.underline} [marketplace]{.underline} and global
media. [[Their images have **catalyzed** new]{.mark} consumer [markets
for products and services]{.mark}.]{.underline} The music of [[hip hop
culture, for example]{.underline}]{.mark}, follows its rhythm and blues
predecessor as a so-called crossover genre that is very popular with
whites and other cultural groups across the globe. [[**Circulated**
through film, television, and music]{.mark}, **news and advertising**,
[mass media]{.mark} constructs and [sells]{.mark} a [**commodified**
black culture]{.mark} from ideas about class, gender and
age.]{.underline} [Through]{.underline} a wide array of [genres ranging
from talk shows to feature length films]{.underline}, television
situation comedies to CDs, video rentals to cable television, [the
images produced and **circulated** within this area all aim [to
**entertain**]{.mark}]{.underline} and amuse [[a]{.underline}]{.mark}
highly segmented [consumer]{.underline} [[market]{.underline}]{.mark}.
This market is increasingly global and subject to the contradictions of
global marketplace phenomena.2 One implication of the significance of
consumption for understanding social class relations of black youth
concerns the constant need to stimulate consumer markets. [Contemporary
[capitalism relies]{.mark}]{.underline} not just
[[on]{.underline}]{.mark} cutting the costs attached to production, but
also on [[**stimulating** consumer demand]{.mark}.]{.underline} Just as
sustaining relations of production requires a steady supply of people to
do the work, sustaining relations of consumption needs ever-expanding
consumer markets. Moreover, [just as people do not naturally work and
must be encouraged or compelled to do so, [people do not engage in
excess consumption without **prompting**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this
context, [[advertising constitutes an important site that
**creates**]{.underline} [**demand** for
commodities]{.underline}]{.mark} [of all sorts.]{.underline} Marketing
and advertising often create demand for things that formerly were not
seen as commodities, for example, the rapid growth of the bottled water
industry, as well as for intangible entities that seem difficult to
commodify. In this regard, [[the]{.mark} rapid [growth of mass
media]{.mark} and new informational **technologies** [has
catalyzed]{.mark} a [**demand** for black culture as a
commodity]{.mark}.]{.underline} As the black culture industry
recognizes, most [market demand]{.underline} for products and services
[stems not from needs but]{.underline} rather from [unmet desires that
must be constantly stimulated.]{.underline} In this context, physical
addictions create ideal consumers who are willing to assume debt to pay
for their addictions. If consumers become addicted to tobacco, alcohol,
drugs or similar products, despite health risks, they can be counted on
to consume. As the repetitive behavior of shopping addicts suggests,
[the ideal consumer is]{.underline} one who is [addicted to
**consumption itself**]{.underline}, never mind the actual product or
service consumed. In this context, [[the interconnections among the
marketing of black culture, addictive behavior]{.mark} of consumers who
buy its products, [and]{.mark} any [consumer debt]{.mark} that ensues
[are **tightly linked**]{.mark}]{.underline}.3 Under this ever-expanding
impetus to create new consumer markets, [[nothing is exempt from]{.mark}
commodification and [**sale**, including the pain that African American
youth experience]{.mark} with **poverty and
powerlessness**.]{.underline} Nowhere is this more evident than in the
contradictions of rap. As Cornel West points out,'the irony in our
present moment is that just as young black men are murdered, maimed and
imprisoned in record numbers, their styles have become
disproportionately influential in shaping popular culture' (West, 1993).
In this context, [[rap becomes the only place where black youth
have]{.mark} public [voice, yet it is]{.mark} a public voice that is
**[commodified]{.mark}** and contained [by what]{.mark} hip hop
[producers think will sell.]{.mark}]{.underline} Despite these
marketplace limitations, rap remains a potential site of contestation, a
place where African American youth can rebel against the police
brutality, lack of jobs, and other social issues that confront them
(Kelley, 1994). Thus, [work on the black culture industry illustrates
how images of black culture function to catalyze
consumption.]{.underline}

[[The **actual bodies** of]{.mark} young [African Americans may also be
commodified]{.mark} as part of a new **black body
politics**]{.underline}. Here, the literature on gender and
globalization, especially the sex industry, is helpful in understanding
how a new black body politics might operate within relations of
consumption. Situating feminist analyses of body politics within
relations of production and consumption that characterize contemporary
globalization provides new avenues for understanding commodification and
the emergence of a new black body politics.4 [For Marx, all workers
under capitalism are **alienated**; they are **objectified** as they
sell their labor power to employers for a wage in order to survive. For
women, especially those in racial/ethnic groups]{.underline} as well as
in industrializing and developing countries alike, [good jobs are more
difficult to find.]{.underline} [Under these circumstances]{.underline},
some women do not sell their bodily labor to produce a commodity.
Instead, [[their bodies become **commodities**]{.mark}.]{.underline} In
a global context, as newly industrializing countries struggle to find
commodity niches in the global economy, they frequently find the best
niches taken. Consequently, [in some countries sex tourism becomes a
significant market fostering national economic development]{.underline}
and international capital accumulation (Wonders and Michalowski, 2001).
[[This]{.mark} new gender [scholarship offers a new]{.mark} [framework
for analyzing a new black body politics that African American youth
confront]{.mark}]{.underline} under conditions of globalization. In the
United States, [African Americans]{.underline} also [find the good jobs
taken and confront a similar issue]{.underline} [of the pressures to
commodify their bodies]{.underline}, especially if those bodies are
young. More importantly, this impetus to commodify black bodies is not
new. [[Chattel slavery]{.underline}]{.mark} in the American South prior
to and during the formation of the American nation state [clearly
[treated]{.mark} the [bodies]{.mark} of people of African descent [as
commodities]{.mark}.]{.underline} Objectifying black bodies enabled
slave traders and slave owners to turn black people's bodies into
commodities. [[Slavers assigned **monetary value** to black]{.mark}
people's [bodies, and then traded black bodies as commodities on the
**open market**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Some scholars on race have taken a
closer look at how the institution of chattel slavery accomplished this
process of objectification, commodification and exploitation. Literary
critic Hortense Spillers suggests that relations of slavery and
colonialism transformed understandings of black people's bodies.
Spillers identifies how ['[captive bodies']{.mark}, namely, the bodies
of **enslaved Africans**, [were severed from their agency]{.mark}, a use
of violence that eliminated gender]{.underline}: 'Their New World,
Diasporic plight marked a theft of the body -- a willful and violent . .
. severing of the captive body from its motive will, its active desire'
(Spillers, 2000: 160). [[This **theft** of the body]{.underline}]{.mark}
severed it from its own agency and thus [[formed the **moment of
objectification**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Spillers suggests that this new
objectified body became a canvas for racist discourse: 'These
indecipherable markings on the captive body render a kind of
hieroglyphics of the flesh whose severe disjunctures come to be hidden
to the cultural seeing by skin color' (Spillers, 2000: 61).
[[Once]{.mark} objectified and **[marked]{.mark}**]{.underline} in this
fashion, [slave owners and [slave traders treated black bodies as
commodities that can be]{.mark} **traded, [bought and sold]{.mark}** on
the open market. The treatment of actual bodies as]{.underline} objects
and subsequently as [commodities within **consumer
markets**]{.underline} as opposed to the appropriation of the labor
power that bodies contain [may be a]{.underline} more [fundamental
element of]{.underline} contemporary [capitalist]{.underline}
[economies]{.underline} than is commonly recognized. French sociological
theorist Colette Guillaumin lays the foundation for a different kind of
historical materialist analysis that rests on body politics (Guillaumin,
1995). Like traditional social class analysis, Guillaumin focuses both
on the economy (the exploitative dimension of appropriation for various
social systems such as slavery and social institutions such as
marriage), and on questions of power and domination. However,
Guillaumin's materialist analysis differs from traditional functionalist
and/or Marxist analyses of stratification/class. In contrast to
traditional social class analyses that begin with the sale of labor
power within capitalist relations, Guillaumin's materialist framework
originates in the appropriation of the body that contains the labor
power itself. Because no form of measuring the value of labor in
isolation from the body itself exists, Guillaumin contends that racism
and sexism both draw upon this physical appropriation of bodies.
[Guillaumin identifies [**slavery** as the fundamental]{.mark}
historical [relationship that fostered modern]{.mark} understandings of
[ideologies of race. Enslaving]{.mark} African bodies [constituted the
**original theft**]{.mark} -- [the stealing of labor came
later.]{.mark}]{.underline} Racial ideologies explaining this process
emerged after slavery was in effect. Guillaumin's theory of the sexual
oppression of women (her analysis of sexage) follows a similar logic.
For Guillaumin, the seizure of women's time, claiming the products of
their bodies such as children, mandating that women use their bodies to
fulfill a sexual obligation, requiring that women's bodies provide
physical care for children, the elderly, the sick as well as healthy
men, all illustrate how men as a class feel that they can appropriate
the bodies of women as a class. Guillaumin points out that [people only
publicly take that which they feel already belongs to them, as is the
case of the public harassment of women in the workplace and on the
street]{.underline}. Guillaumin provides a provocative piece of the
puzzle for constructing an argument concerning the commodification of
the actual bodies as well as representations of the bodies of African
American youth within contemporary global capitalist economies. [New
[forms of]{.mark} [commodification within]{.mark} the constant pressure
to expand [consumer markets **catalyze** a new]{.mark} black [body
politics where]{.mark} social class [relations]{.mark} [rest]{.mark} not
solely on exploiting labor power]{.underline} and/or mystifying
exploitation through images, [but also [on the **appropriation of
bodies** themselves]{.mark}]{.underline}. Whereas young black bodies
were formerly valued for their labor power, under advanced capitalism,
their utility lies elsewhere. Because bodies are not simply raced but
also gendered, [this new black body politics takes **gender-specific**
forms]{.underline}. In particular, beginning in the 1980s, the [[bodies
of]{.mark} young [black men became increasingly]{.mark} [appropriated by
the **prison system**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Typically,
[these]{.underline} alarming [rates of incarceration have been
interpreted as central to new mechanisms of **social
control**]{.underline} (Collins, 2004: 215--46). [[The]{.mark}
discipline]{.underline} [of]{.underline} young African American men that
lands so many in [[prison seems woven into]{.mark} the fabric of
[**everyday life**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Within large [urban areas,
[gangs, ghettoes, public schools]{.mark}, public housing [and prison
work together in a]{.mark} quasi-[**seamless
fashion**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Prisons]{.underline} [and ghettos gain
meaning from one another and both shape]{.underline} [**new racial
formations** within American society]{.underline} (Wacquant, 2001). On
one level, the growth of the punishment industry constitutes an
effective political response to this puzzle of idleness among young
black men as well as an effective mechanism for curtailing their
citizenship rights. If there are no jobs, one can hardly make them go to
them. Racial profiling and locking up men seemed designed to discipline
them into not challenging a system that treated them as throwaways. [The
issue of [felon **disenfranchisement** speaks to this need to discipline
black men]{.mark} through the prison system.]{.underline} In the early
2000s, [[48]{.mark} [states in the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [had
felon disenfranchisement]{.mark} laws.]{.underline} Under felon
disenfranchisement laws, [criminal offenders typically forfeit voting
rights]{.underline} as a collateral consequence of their felony
convictions. These laws appear to be race neutral, yet because young
black men are disproportionately incarcerated, these laws have a
racially disparate impact on this group. In a comprehensive study of
these laws, Behrens and Ugger conclude: our key finding can be
summarized concisely and forcefully: the racial composition of state
prisons is firmly associated with the adoption of state felon
disenfranchisement laws. States with greater nonwhite prison populations
have been more likely to ban convicted felons from voting than states
with proportionately fewer nonwhites in the criminal justice system.
(Behrens and Uggen, 2003: 596) Yet [the growth of [the **punishment
industry**]{.mark} also [illustrates how black male bodies are]{.mark}
objectified, [commodified]{.mark} and incorporated in service [to
maintain]{.mark}ing [prisons as **consumer
markets**.]{.mark}]{.underline} In essence, [[Black]{.mark} men's
commodified [bodies become]{.mark} used as **[raw materials]{.mark}**
for the growing prison industry.]{.underline} It is very simple -- no
prisoners, means no jobs for all of the ancillary industries that
service this growth industry. [Because [prisons]{.mark} express little
interest in rehabilitating prisoners, they [need a steady]{.mark}
[**supply** of bodies.]{.mark} The focus is less on appropriating the
labor]{.underline} of incarcerated black men (although this does happen)
[than in finding profitable uses for their **bodies**]{.underline} while
the state absorbs the costs of incarceration. If Kentucky Fried Chicken
found chickens in short supply, they would close and their profitability
would shrink. [The Kentucky Fried Chicken Corporation]{.underline} has
little interest in extracting labor from its chickens or in coaxing them
to change their ways. Rather, the corporation [needs a constant supply
of cheap, virtually identical chickens to ensure that their business
will remain profitable. In this way, [prisons]{.mark} made [use]{.mark}
of the [bodies of unemployed]{.mark}, unskilled young [black
men,]{.mark} the [virtually indistinguishable]{.mark} young [black men
who populate]{.mark} corners of American [cities]{.mark}.]{.underline}
The vast majority of young black people who are incarcerated by the
punishment industry are male, yet [it is important to remember that
disproportionately high numbers of young **black women** are also
incarcerated and thus are subject to this form of
commodification.]{.underline} Moreover, [young black women may also
encounter an additional bodily commodification of their
sexuality]{.underline}. The majority of sex workers may be female,
obscuring the minority of males who also perform sex work as well as the
objectification and commodification of black male bodies within mass
media as an important component of the sex work industry. [In essence,
[the bodies]{.mark} and images [of]{.mark} young [African Americans
constitute]{.mark} new [commodities that are **central** to
global]{.mark} relations of [consumption]{.mark}]{.underline}, not
marginalized within them.

Here, I want to take a closer look at this process by exploring how
[[sexuality has]{.mark} grown in [importance in the **commodification**
of the bodies]{.mark}]{.underline} and images [of black American
youth]{.underline} and how this [sex work in turn articulates with black
agency in responding to advanced **capitalism**]{.underline}. In
essence, [[black youth are]{.underline}]{.mark} now [caught up [in
a]{.mark} burgeoning **[sex work industry]{.mark}**]{.underline}, one
that is far broader than commercial sex work as depicted in the media.
Young [African Americans participate in the sex work
industry]{.underline}, not primarily as commercial workers as is
popularly imagined, but rather, [as [representations of commodified
black sexuality]{.mark} as well as potential new **consumer markets**
eager to consume their own images. [Racialized images of pimps and
prostitutes may be the]{.mark} commercial [sex workers who are **most
visible**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the relations of production, yet the
industry itself is much broader.5 A broader definition of sex work
suggests how [the sex work industry has been a **crucial** part of the
expansion of consumer markets]{.underline}.6 [[The]{.mark} sex work
[industry encompasses]{.mark} a set of social practices]{.underline},
many of which may not immediately be recognizable as sex work, [as well
as a constellation of [**representations** that create demand for sexual
services, attach **value** to such]{.mark} services, [**identify**
sexual commodities with race]{.mark}, gender and age-specific
individuals, [and rules that **regulate** this]{.mark} increasingly
important consumer [market]{.mark}]{.underline}. Feminists argue that
[[class, race]{.mark}, ethnicity, age [and citizenship]{.mark}
**categories**]{.underline} work to [[**position** women]{.mark}
differently [within]{.mark} [the]{.mark} global [sex]{.mark} work
[industry]{.mark}.7]{.underline} By far, [international **trafficking**
of women and girls for purposes of prostitution]{.underline} has
received the lion's share of attention. Here, [race, ethnicity
[and]{.mark} age [shape the commodification of women's bodies to
determine]{.mark} the **[value]{.mark}** placed on categories of sex
workers.]{.underline} The discussions of global prostitution and
trafficking of women highlight the exploitation of large numbers of
women, yet it is difficult to locate young African American women and
the sex work of young black men within this literature. In particular,
women who are not engaged in visible sex work or who do not show up on
crime statistics on sex workers are often considered outside the realm
of sex work. Here, I want to pursue a different argument, namely, [the
case that [sex work is **permeating** the]{.mark} very [fabric of
African American]{.mark} [communities]{.mark} in ways that resemble how
sex work has changed the societies of developing countries]{.underline}.
In essence, [poor and working-class African American youth increasingly
encounter few opportunities for jobs in urban neighborhoods while the
mass marketing of sexuality permeates consumer markets]{.underline}. In
this sense, [their situation resembles that of [black youth]{.mark}
globally who [confront]{.mark} similar pressures in response to
globalization.]{.underline} At the same time, [the situation of African
American youth is **unique** in that [the sexualized images that]{.mark}
they encounter [are of]{.mark} **[themselves]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In
essence, [[their own bodies]{.mark} often [serve as **symbols**
of]{.mark} this [**sexualized culture**, placing]{.mark} African
American [youth in the]{.mark} peculiar [position **claiming and
rejecting** themselves]{.mark}.]{.underline} How might this happen?

#### Consumerism [subsumes]{.underline} the [social fabric]{.underline} of Nigerian life. The global sex work industry [redefines]{.underline} Nigerian family values and puts Black female bodies up for [auction]{.underline} in the market of [exploitation]{.underline}.

[From the Bahamas to Cuba, Caribbean societies]{.underline} that
**[depend]{.underline} [heavily]{.underline} [on]{.underline}** tourism
recognize how important [sex work]{.underline} can be for local
economies (Alexander, 1997). These societies recognize how sex work has
been reconfigured within their domestic borders, especially following
[the]{.underline} Structural Adjustment Policies of the 1980s
(Emeagwali, 1995). Building on this literature, I investigate how
[reconfiguration of [the sex work industry within the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates has **[shaped]{.mark}** the domestic [relations within
African American communities]{.mark}]{.underline} generally and for poor
and working-class African American youth in particular. Nigeria, the
most populous nation state on the African continent, provides an
important case for building such an analysis. Reporting on patterns of
trafficking in Italy, [Eshohe Aghatise describes **[differential
mechanisms]{.mark}** used to [traffic women from East]{.mark}ern
[Europe]{.mark} [and Nigeria]{.mark} as well [as]{.mark} the
differential [**value** placed on women within]{.mark} Italian [**sex
markets**.]{.mark} The trafficking of Nigerian women and young girls
into Italy for **prostitution** began]{.underline} in the 1980s [in
response to]{.underline} Nigeria's [**economic** problems caused
by]{.underline} structural adjustment policies of [the]{.underline}
International Monetary Fund ([IMF]{.underline}) (Emeagwali, 1995). As
Agahtise points out: [[women]{.mark} and girls [started leaving
Nigeria]{.mark} for Europe [on **promises** of fantastic]{.mark}
well-paying [jobs]{.mark} to be obtained]{.underline} in factories,
offices, and farms. [[They arrived]{.underline}]{.mark} in Italy only
[[to find]{.underline} [themselves]{.underline}]{.mark} [lured into
prostitution]{.underline} [and [**sold** into sexual slavery to pay off
debts]{.mark}]{.underline}, which they were told they incurred in being
'helped' to come to Europe. (Aghatise, 2004: 1129) [Most Nigerian
victims of trafficking are illiterate]{.underline} and lacked any
exposure to urban life. The shifting patterns of economic and social
change within Nigerian society also contributed to the patterns of
trafficking. [Traffickers preyed]{.underline} not only on the poverty of
Nigerian victims, but also [on the breakdown of social and cultural
values [within Nigerian society]{.mark}]{.underline}, in particular,
[the]{.underline} disintegration of [[family]{.mark}
structures]{.underline} and a weak social welfare state. For many
families, [[send]{.mark}ing [female children abroad]{.mark} became a
status symbol: [Subscribing to a **consumerist model**]{.mark} that is
widely publicized]{.underline} on television and in magazines with
messages of high living in the West, and in the oral reports of
'been-tos' (a popular name in Nigeria given to those who have been to
Western Europe, Canada or the United States), many families believe that
it is easy to obtain wealth abroad, and that earning money, in whatever
way, will be quick. (Aghatise, 2004: 1132) Aghatise offers a especially
harsh criticism of a society that embraces consumerism and sells its
daughters to pay for it: The beginning years of Nigeria's economic boom
from petrol dollars left the legacy of a people who had acquired a taste
for a high standard of living and a consumer society that no longer had
the means to satisfy its purchasing habits but was not ready to admit or
accept it. (Aghatise, 2004: 1133) [[Trafficking of women and
girls]{.mark} to Italy [demonstrates the **fraying social fabric** of
Nigerian society]{.mark}, especially the ways in which women absorb the
pressures placed on families under changing public
policies]{.underline}. [Most of the women trafficked]{.underline} to
Italy [are from polygamous families]{.underline} from the Edo ethnic
group where wives are in a continuous struggle for a share of the family
resources for themselves and their children. [Even if men have jobs,
their earnings are **rarely enough** to provide for the needs of the
entire family]{.underline}. As Aghatise suggests: [because many men
continue to marry]{.underline} more than one wife, it is
[[women]{.underline}]{.mark} who [[are expected to assume more and
**more responsibility**]{.underline}]{.mark} for families . . . women
traditionally play an adhesive role in the social context of the Edo
ethnic group. The success or failure of a family in its individual and
collective projects is usually attributed to the women in the house.
Thus, the greater responsibility is implicitly that of the women.
(Aghatise, 2004: 1135) The worsening conditions within the Nigerian
economy, the weak welfare state, and cultural expectations of women
meant that women who were trafficked in the 1990s were mainly much
younger girls who set out on a job search to help their families.
Trafficking of girls and women is a problem, yet an additional issue
concerns the use of girls within domestic sex work markets. In a rare
analysis of how sex work is organized within a black society, Bamgbose
examines emerging patterns of adolescent prostitution in Nigeria. As she
bluntly claims, ['the truth is that in Nigeria, cultural values have
**broken down'**]{.underline} (Bamgbose, 2002: 569). Bamgbose describes
how [[the]{.mark} [global sex industry now **penetrates** into Nigerian
society: Adolescent prostitution is now out in the **open**]{.mark} in
Nigeria after decades of]{.underline} what has amounted to a
[cross-cultural conspiracy of silence]{.underline} . . . [[it has
assumed]{.underline}]{.mark} the proportion of [[a multibillion-dollar
industry with adolescents]{.mark} being [**sold and traded**
like]{.mark} other [mass-produced **goods**.]{.mark}]{.underline} It is
no longer restricted to certain parts of the world; [it]{.underline} has
penetrated into Nigerian society and [is now a thriving business in most
Nigerian cities.]{.underline} (Bamgbose, 2002: 571) Because the men who
[patronize [the]{.mark} sex [industry]{.mark}]{.underline} prefer
younger sex workers, young women more often service clientele, with
older women working as madams who procure the adolescent sex workers.
Offering a rare insight into adolescent sex work within an African
society, Bamgbose describes how the domestic Nigerian sex work industry
operates, one divided into a continuum of activities of the 'Sugar Daddy
Syndrome', 'night brides', 'floating prostitutes', 'call girls', and
finally, trafficking: Unlike the traditional prostitutes who are usually
older women, adolescent prostitutes start their careers in prostitution
in more comfortable hotel rooms or in a more sophisticated style. This
is what gave rise to the form of prostitution termed the 'Sugar Daddy
Syndrome'. (Bamgbose, 2002: 572) Under the Sugar Daddy Syndrome, young
girls patronize men, usually older in age, for sexual pleasure. Such
older men, who are wealthy, are usually referred to as 'sugar daddies'
or 'man friends'. They are the favorites of adolescent girls who seek
financial and material support in return for their services. The
duration of this relationship lasts longer than a one-night stand, and
the economic power wielded by such older and wealthy men, irrespective
of educational status, [[puts]{.underline} [the young
girls]{.underline}]{.mark} [involved [in]{.mark} a particularly
**[vulnerable]{.mark}** [position]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bamgbose, 2002:
572--3).

#### [Endlessly circulated]{.underline} images of [hypersexualized]{.underline} Black women [normalizes]{.underline} the economy of sexual exchange which constructs the "[modern Jezebel]{.underline}". In the US, this sexualization led to [spikes]{.underline} in HIV rates and [further commodification]{.underline} of female bodies.

[[The consequences of this]{.mark} sex-for-material-goods situation [can
be **tragic**.]{.mark} The **pressures** for young black women to engage
in [sex work have]{.mark} [affected the **rapid growth** of
HIV]{.mark}/AIDS [among poor black women]{.mark} in the Mississippi
Delta and across the rural South]{.underline}. [Between 1990 and 2000,
[Southern states]{.mark} with large African American populations
[experienced a **dramatic increase** in HIV infections among African
American women]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, [in Mississippi,
**28.5 percent** of those reporting new HIV infections in 2000 were
black women, up from **13 percent** in 1990. [In Alabama, the number
rose to **31 percent**, from 13 percent]{.mark}]{.underline}, whereas in
North Carolina, it rose to 27 percent, from 18 percent (Sack, 2001).
[Most of the women contracted HIV through heterosexual
contact]{.underline}, and most found out that they were HIV positive
when they became pregnant. The women took risks that may at first seem
nonsensical. Yet in the context of their lives [there was a sense that
[because they had]{.mark} so [**little control** over]{.mark} other
aspects of [their lives, they felt]{.mark} that [if God wanted them to
get AIDS, then they **resigned**]{.mark} themselves [to getting
it]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [These examples suggest]{.underline}]{.mark}
[that many young [African American women **resign**]{.mark} themselves
[to commodifying their bodies as a]{.mark} necessary [source of
**income**]{.mark}]{.underline}. They may not be streetwalkers in the
traditional sense, but [[they]{.mark} also [view]{.mark} commodified
[black sexuality as the **commodity** of value that they can
**exchange**]{.mark}]{.underline}. These relations also become difficult
to disrupt [in the context of a powerful [mass media]{.mark} that
defines and [**sells** images of sexualized black women as one
**icon**]{.mark} of seemingly authentic black culture. Young [African
American women encounter]{.mark}]{.underline} a set of [[representations
that]{.mark} **naturalizes and [normalize]{.mark}s** social relations of
[sex work]{.mark}]{.underline}. Whether [[she]{.underline}]{.mark}
sleeps with men for pleasure, drugs, revenge, or money, [the
**sexualized** bitch [constitutes a modern]{.mark} version of the
**[Jezebel]{.mark}**, repackaged for contemporary mass
media.]{.underline} In discussing this updated Jezebel image, cultural
critic Lisa Jones distinguishes between gold diggers/skeezers, namely,
women who screw for status, and crack 'hos', namely, women who screw for
a fix (1994: 79). Some women are the 'hos' who trade sexual favors for
jobs, money, drugs and other material items. [The female hustler, a
materialist woman who is willing to sell, rent, or use her sexuality to
get whatever she wants constitutes this sexualized variation of the
bitch]{.underline}. This image appears with increasing frequency,
especially in conjunction with trying to catch an African American man
with money. Athletes are targets, and having a baby with an athlete is a
way to garner income. Black women who are sex workers, namely, those who
engage in phone sex, lap dancing, and prostitution for compensation,
also populate this universe of sexualized bitches. The prostitute who

[[Black male involvement in the sex work industry
may]{.underline}]{.mark} not [[involve]{.underline}]{.mark} the direct
exploitation of black men's bodies as much as [[the]{.mark}
objectification and [commodification]{.mark} [of sexualized black male
images within **hip hop** culture]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [The
prevalence of **representations** of black men as pimps speaks to this
image of black men as sexual hustlers who use their sexual prowess to
**exploit** women]{.underline}, both black and white. Ushered in by a
series of films in the 'Blaxploitation' era, the ubiquitous black pimp
seems here to stay. Kept alive through HBO produced quasi-documentaries
such as [Pimps Up, Hos Down, African American men feature prominently in
**mass media**]{.underline}. Despite these media constructions, actual
pimps see themselves more as businessmen than as sexual predators. For
example, the men interviewed in the documentary American Pimp all
discuss the skills involved in being a successful pimp. One went so far
as to claim that only African American men made really good pimps. Thus,
the controlling image of the black pimp combines all of elements of the
more generic hustler, namely, engaging in illegal activity, using women
for economic gain, and refusing to work. [[Representations of black
women and men as **prostitutes** and **pimps** **permeate** music
videos, film and television.]{.mark} In]{.underline} the context of a
powerful [global mass media, black men's bodies are **increasingly
objectified** within popular culture]{.underline} [in ways that resemble
the treatment of all women. [Violence and sexuality **sell**,]{.mark}
and associating [black men]{.mark} with both [is]{.mark}]{.underline}
virtually [[sure]{.mark} [to please]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet [the real
struggle is]{.underline} less [about]{.underline} the content of black
male and black female images and more about [the treatment of black
people's bodies as **valuable** **commodities** within advertising and
entertainment.]{.underline} [[Because this new constellation of images
participates in **commodified global capitalism**]{.underline}]{.mark},
in all cases, [[representations of black]{.mark} people's [bodies are
tied to]{.mark} structures of **[profitability]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Athletes and criminals alike are profitable, not for the vast majority
of African American men, but for the [[people]{.underline}]{.mark} who
own the teams, control the media, provide food, clothing and telephone
services to the prisons, and who **[[consume]{.underline}]{.mark}**
seemingly [[**endless** images of pimps, hustlers,]{.mark} rapists, [and
felons]{.mark}]{.underline}. What is different, however, is how [[these
images]{.mark} of authentic blackness [generate]{.mark} additional
**[consumer markets]{.mark}**]{.underline} beyond the selling of these
specific examples of cultural production. [Recognizing the value of
commodified **black culture**, many African American [rap stars]{.mark}
have [start]{.mark}ed [their own]{.mark} record labels, clothing
[companies]{.mark}, and more recently, sports drink
divisions]{.underline}. [Their desire lies in sharing the **profits** of
a huge global consumer market of]{.underline} youth who purchase the rap
CDs, sports drinks, gym shoes, and clothing lines of [hip hop
culture]{.underline}. Take, for example, [the 2003 release of [Pimp
Juice, a]{.mark} new [sports]{.mark} [beverage]{.mark}]{.underline} that
was lauded by Vibe magazine as the best energy drink. Despite Pimp
Juice's claims that it provides vitamins and that its 10 percent apple
juice content makes it healthy, [the yellow and white design of its can
[resembles beer cans.]{.mark}]{.underline} Initially, [Pimp Juice was
[**marketed** within African American
neighborhoods]{.mark}]{.underline}, yet by 2004 Pimp Juice was
disseminated by 60 distributors in the United States, in 32 states and
in 81 markets. According to [[its]{.underline}]{.mark} distributor,
because [Pimp Juice is [flying off the shelves]{.mark} in the UK, the
Caribbean Islands, and Mexico]{.underline}, the distributor aims to sell
the product in Australia, Japan, China and Israel. The irony of this
particular product is that [[Nelly]{.mark}, the rap star whose [song
titled 'Pimp Juice']{.mark} helped resurrect the **popularity** of the
concept of the pimp]{.underline}, also owns the company that distributes
Pimp Juice. [This one product [illustrates the]{.mark} increasingly
[seamless relations among]{.mark} the [commodification of **black
images**]{.mark} (pimp/prostitute), [struggles between
**corporations**]{.mark} and hip hop capitalists (rap star Nelly) in
search of new consumer markets, [the expansion of new]{.mark} consumer
[markets]{.mark} (how Pimp Juice is marketed to black consumers),
[and]{.mark} potentially [new systems of **control** within]{.mark}
African American civil [society]{.mark} that grow from the same
conditions that sparked changes within Nigerian society]{.underline}.
Beverage makers claim that pimp juice is a benign sports drink --
www.letitloose.com, Pimp Juice's official web site describe it as a
'healthy, non-carbonated energy drink possessing a tropical berry
flavor' -- yet when Black American youth buy pimp juice at their corner
store, they most likely are singing the lyrics Nelly's song 'Pimp Juice'
while they pay \$1.89 for one can of actual 'Pimp Juice'. The lyrics of
Nelly's song 'Pimp Juice' make it clear what pimp juice really is and
who it is for. Nelly opens his song by boasting that because his woman
only wants him for his 'pimp juice', he needs to 'cut her loose'. He
then moves on to describe the power seats, leather and sunroof of his
pimpmobile. When 'hoes see it', according to Nelly, they 'can't believe
it'. Nelly knows their game and puts them out, telling them to dust
their shoes off so as not to touch his rug. For those who still don't
get it, Nelly ends his song with a rousing definition of pimp juice:
'your pimp juice is anything, attract the opposite sex, it could be
money, fame, or straight intellect'. Always an equal-opportunity kind of
guy, [Nelly proclaims, 'bitches got the pimp juice too, come to think
about it dirty, they got more than we do'. By itself, the song 'Pimp
Juice' is just a song. Yet when coupled with [the music video of]{.mark}
Nelly representing a pimp and **mass marketing campaigns** that [put
cans of]{.mark} actual [Pimp Juice in corner stores]{.mark} for young
African Americans to see and buy, [the circle is
**complete**]{.mark}]{.underline}. African American youths' encounters
with Pimp Juice comprise the case examined here, yet [the new
commodities and new consumer markets in this example point to much
**larger issues**. [The hip hop capitalism of Nelly's]{.mark} brilliant
[marketing]{.mark} of 'Pimp Juice' [illustrates how sexualized
understandings of black]{.mark} women's and men's [bodies and culture
become]{.mark} marketed and [**put up for sale** **in the global
marketplace**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It also focuses on new consumers of
bodies and images, in particular, how [[black people become target
audiences for their **own degradation**]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g. the
case of pimp juice) as well as Nelly's plans to go global with this
popular product. When it comes to the commodification of black bodies,
few African Americans celebrate the criminal justice system. At the same
time, [when it comes to the commodification of images associated with
prison culture as well as an array of **products** that seemingly signal
a seemingly authentic black culture, blacks are well represented among
the consumers of these images.]{.underline}

### [T -- Pornography Market]{.underline}

For over 30 years western feminists have had powerful and deeply
divisive debates about the roles of pornographic media and sexual
commerce in promoting heterosexist institutions and social relations.
These debates, which became known as the 'Sex Wars', exacerbated many
bitter philosophical divisions between feminists (Duggan and Hunter,
1995). Touting Robin Morgan's catchphrase, '[[Porn is the theory, rape
is the **practice'**]{.mark}, (Morgan, 1980) radical, anti-pornography
feminists defined pornography as the 'graphic and sexually explicit
**subordination** of women through pictures and/or words']{.underline}
(Dworkin and MacKinnon, 1988: 36). According to their argument,
[[porn]{.mark}ography [represents the 'subordination of women
**perfectly** achieved']{.mark}]{.underline}, (Dworkin, 1993: 523) [[as
it commodifies rape, and]{.mark} endorses and [encourages men's
**abusive** sexual desires]{.mark} and behaviors towards
women]{.underline} (Russell, 2000: 50). Alternatively, anticensorship,
liberal, and sex-positive feminists identified pornography as a
convenient but hazardous scapegoat for attacks on sexual dissent, and as
a complex discourse 'full of multiple, contradictory, layered, and
highly contextual meanings' (Duggan and Hunter, 1995: 7). Even within a
heterosexist system of domination, they argued, [[oppressed
groups]{.mark}, such as women and sexual minorities, [view
porn]{.mark}ography in a multiplicity of ways, [often
counter-appropriating]{.mark} seemingly [**exploitative** material and
positively transforming their meaning]{.mark}.]{.underline} Although
largely a heteronormative capitalist mode of production, [pornography
nevertheless offers women and men, consumers and participants, spaces
and possibilities for counter-appropriation, self-expression, pleasure,
and labor]{.underline} (Kipnis, 1997; Weitzer, 2000). On the margins of
the Sex Wars, African American [feminist [scholars have
written]{.mark}]{.underline} a great deal [[about]{.underline}]{.mark}
the issue of [[sexual representation]{.mark}, focusing [on the
exploitation of black women's bodies within patriarchal, **racial
capitalism**]{.mark} in the USA. [They]{.mark} have examined how African
American women's sexualities [are]{.mark} inherently [informed
by]{.mark} the [**objectification**]{.mark} of their bodies
[necessitated by]{.mark} the **sexual economy** of
[slavery,]{.mark}]{.underline} [and black women's own historical efforts
to reclaim their bodies and define their **womanhood**.]{.underline}
These writers explain how [black women have challenged dominant
imaginings of black sexuality as pathological, explaining also their
attempts to achieve sexual autonomy in the face of the widespread
discourse of black sexual deviancy]{.underline} (Hobson, 2005; Rose,
2003; SharpelyWhiting, 2007). Yet, for black women, defining sexual
autonomy has not been an easy task. First, what Evelyn Brooks
Higginbotham (1993) terms [[a 'politics of **respectability'**
has]{.mark} historically [discouraged black women from creating a
**framework** for sexual subjectivity outside of
heteronormative]{.mark}, domestic, and [bourgeois family
relations]{.mark}]{.underline} (White, 2001). Many black queer scholars
(Johnson and Henderson, 2005; McBride, 1998; Stallings, 2007) have noted
the difficulty in addressing issues of sexual subjectivity, due to what
Matt Richardson notes as [[the]{.mark} 'erasure of a broad array of
black sexuality and **gendered being**, in favor of a static
[heterosexual narrative']{.mark}]{.underline} (Richardson, 2003: 63). In
addition to the politics of respectability, historian Darlene Clark Hine
(1989) [[proposes]{.mark} black women possess [a]{.mark} 'culture of
dissemblance', a culture of **masking, silence, secrecy**, and
[**disavowal** of sexuality in black women's lives,]{.mark} employed [as
a]{.mark} [method to **protect** them]{.mark} from sexual
injury.]{.underline} Unfortunately, [[these]{.mark} twin cultural
[traditions]{.mark} frame sexual deviance as dangerous and [marginalize
women who deviate from **respectability**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
dissemblance [by participating in non-normative
sexualities]{.underline}, including queer, contractual, or public
sexuality (Hammonds, 1997; Stallings, 2007). According to Evelynn
Hammonds (1997), 'The restrictive, repressive and dangerous aspects of
black female sexuality has been emphasized by black feminist writers
while pleasure, exploration, and agency have gone under-analyzed' (1997:
385). Those black feminist scholars who have written about pornography
tend to find affinity with radical feminists, deeming the form
inherently dangerous for women -- especially black women. For example,
Patricia Hill Collins (2000), Alice Walker (1980, 1981), Tracy Gardener
(1980), Luisah Teish (1980), and Aminatta Forna (2001 \[1992\]) contend
that [sexual violence is 'typically or implicitly a theme of
pornography']{.underline} (Collins, 2000: 135). Though violence and
misogyny towards black women in pornography, [sex work and elsewhere is
a critical and extremely painful concern]{.underline}, the theoretical
equivalence made by scholars between pornography and violence remains
troubling. Pornography is framed as a monolithic cultural production and
industry and is blamed for the degradation and violation of black women,
rather than situated as a historically complex, dynamic media genre. As
Linda Williams (2004a: 12) notes, pornography is a 'genre for the
production of sexual viewing pleasure' -- including, potentially, black
women's own pleasure.

#### A [framework]{.underline} of the [illicit erotic economy]{.underline} uncovers the [creative and productive]{.underline} elements in a world of [sexual capital]{.underline}. To [survive]{.underline} and prosper, Black women own their [sexual deviancy]{.underline} through transgressions of cultural and social [norms]{.underline}.

While some hardcore images are misogynistic, violent and racist, not all
pornography is such. [If we look]{.underline}, for example, [at
pornography created by black women such as Vanessa Blue, Diana Devoe,
Venus Hottentot, or Shine Louise-Houston, we see **erotic expression**
that is much more **creative** and **pleasurable** than many critics
might suspect]{.underline}.3 [As producers and consumers, women
participate in pornography's **sexual economy** in ways that suggest
that its consubstantiation with violence and subordination should be
**re-evaluated**]{.underline} (Chapkis, 1997; Duggan and Hunter, 1995;
Juffer, 1998). [[We should]{.mark} also **[interrogate]{.mark}** [how
pornography addresses]{.mark} the sexual [desires]{.mark}, fantasies,
fetishes and expressions [of black]{.mark} sexual
[subjects]{.mark}]{.underline} as well the presumed white male
voyeuristic consumer. [[It is crucial to]{.mark} take [account]{.mark}
of the deeply problematic [issues of **racialized sexism** in
porn]{.mark}ography]{.underline} as a media genre and industry,
[[while]{.mark} at the same time [**uncovering** the voices]{.mark} and
experiences [of black erotic laborers]{.mark} as they mobilize their
sexualities for pleasure and profit.]{.underline} Illicit Eroticism [in
a Global Economy of Sex Work]{.underline} In a globalizing economy where
[media industries and [**sexual** **commerce** offer]{.mark} avenues for
mobility and [profit]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bernstein, 2007; Ehrenreich
and Hoschchild, 2002), [[black women are finding]{.mark} new ways to
employ **erotic embodiment** by putting sexuality to work]{.underline}
in often informal, illicit economies of sex (Achebe, 2004; Collins,
2006; Kempadoo, 1999, 2005). Noting their complex eroticization in
[transnational racial economies of desire]{.underline}, Kemala Kempadoo
asserts that, 'the sale of sexual labor is an integral part of many
working Third World women's lives and strategies' (Kempadoo, 1998: 124).
Through my research on black women in the US porn industry, I developed
[[the paradigm of '**illicit erotic economy'** as a way to
theorize:]{.mark} (1) [the **historical representation** of black bodies
as sites for]{.mark} a vast array of [forbidden sexual desires]{.mark},
fantasies, and practices, [and]{.mark} (2) [how black subjects
symbolically]{.mark} and strategically [labor within the]{.mark}
prohibited **[terrain of sex]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Taking the lead
from the work of Sharon Harley (2002) on African American women's use of
underground economies during the early 20th century, [I [consider
illicit eroticism as a **framework** to understand how]{.mark} [black
subjects labor in the **sexual economy**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
[Reflective of African Americans' historical engagement in informal,
**underground**, illegal, and quasi-legal income generating activities
-- [from prostitution to pimping]{.mark}, drug dealing, music and movie
pirating, street **performance**, and childcare -- [illicit eroticism
offers black women]{.mark} who are marginalized in the formal labor
market [ways to **survive** **and prosper**.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}Encompassing a range of informal and intimate labors, [illicit
[erotic workers employ their **sexual capital**]{.mark}, talents, and
knowledges [to]{.mark} perform sexual service work on 'the margins' of
an economy increasingly focused on the **commodification** of
intimacy]{.underline} (Agustin, 2007: 21; Zelizer, 2005). More than
survival skills, [illicit eroticism [eschew]{.mark}s the [logics of
sexual **respectability**]{.mark}, dissemblance, and normativity. [Black
women in porn]{.mark}ography [transgress multiple]{.mark} moral,
[cultural]{.mark}, and social [boundaries as they]{.mark} [mobilize
their **outlaw**, racialized sexuality for
work]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [They use the demand for their
mythic hypersexuality as a vehicle to]{.underline}, as Luise White
suggests in her research on prostitution in colonial Nairobi, to
'[reproduce themselves and their dependents']{.underline} (1990: 12).
One performer underscores this point -- black women in pornography labor
for their families: 'I have always had a family to take care of, in some
fashion or another. I have no idea what it is like to earn all my money
and keep it all'. Historian Robin D.G. Kelley (1997) argues that this
[selective appropriation of [**selfcommodification** is]{.mark} both
[strategic and creative]{.mark} in its engagement with capitalism:
African Americans have mobilized self-commodification through the
**transformation** of leisure, pleasure, and creative expression into
labor]{.underline}. [[Black sex workers transform]{.underline}]{.mark}
what Kelley defines as 'labor not associated with wage work -- [[sexual
play]{.mark} and intercourse -- [into **income'**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(1997: 73). [This 'play-labor']{.underline} (1997: 45--6) is not
necessarily resistant to hegemonic institutions of power, nor is it
meant to be. It [is one strategy by which young people]{.underline},
women, minorities, Third World subjects, the working-class, and others
[navigate the capitalist political economy by using their corporeal
resources]{.underline} -- resources that may be the only ones they can
control. Participating in a continuum of sexual labor -- [[from dating
to]{.mark} erotic massage, streetwalking, escorting, modeling, [exotic
dance]{.mark}, phone sex, internet porn, S/M domination, [or]{.mark}
performing in [sex films -- black women **strategically maneuver**
the]{.mark} illicit [erotic economy to promote their survival, autonomy,
and well-being]{.mark}.]{.underline} According to my research, women are
motivated by what is considered relatively flexible and high-income work
offering increased opportunities for self-care, and a sense of
recognition for their erotic embodiment and sexual talents. Some enter
the industry on a casual basis, to pay for rent, childcare, school fees,
family bills, or a car, while others seek careers in the sex-obsessed
entertainment industry and see adult entertainment as a stepping-stone
to something else. For many women, fame vis-á-vis [the adult industry is
seen as a viable, if defiant, aspiration --]{.underline} [one that
reflects what cultural critics have noted as the '**pornification'** of
popular culture]{.underline} during the last 15 to 20 years (Paasonen et
al., 2007). [This kind of sexual visibility could reflect a desire by
young black women to harness the subjective power of eroticism made
popular by black actresses, entertainers, and sexual outlaws like Pam
Grier, Lil' Kim, or Josephine Baker.]{.underline}

#### **In the [sexual marketplace]{.underline} Blackness is a [devalued commodity]{.underline} of sexual [fantasies]{.underline} sold in a [commercial empire]{.underline} of white idealism.**

**Miller-Young '10** (Mireille Miller-Young, Professor at UCSB, "Putting
Hypersexuality to Work: Black Women and Illicit Eroticism in

During seven years of ethnographic forays into adult industry worksites
-- including film sets, production offices, business conventions, awards
ceremonies, and industry events -- I observed many instances of blatant
disregard for black women. Like their locations in the back and on the
margins of the most important adult entertainment business convention in
the world, Adult Video News' Adult Expo, black women's place in the
commercial hardcore industry is peripheral and precarious. [[Black women
are **systemically** positioned in]{.mark} spaces and [roles of
**lesser**]{.mark} [importance to white women, who are valued as the
most **prized commodities** in the **sexual marketplace**]{.mark} of
hardcore.]{.underline} [Women of color]{.underline} generally [occupy a
diminished space in comparison to **idealized** white adult performers,
yet black women seem to be most disparaged]{.underline}, and as a
consequence, vulnerable to the kinds of verbal and symbolic violence
that I witnessed at the Adult Expo. In an industry that values and
trades in the sexuality of women, one would think that black women's
presumed hypersexuality would give them an advantage. In fact,
paradoxically, it is just the opposite. Like the cruel comments of the
director I overheard, [rather than being valued for their erotic skills,
black women are devalued as '**skanks'**.]{.underline} If black women
are so derided in the adult entertainment industry, why do they enter
it, and what do they make of entrenched racism and heterosexism within
the business? Considering the devaluing of their representations and
labor in pornography, I investigate how [[black women put their
**hypersexuality** to work for their own interests in **survival**,
success and erotic autonomy]{.underline}]{.mark} (Alexander, 2005).
[[Hierarchies of value organize the **production, distribution, and**
**consumption** of pornography media, in]{.mark} addition to structuring
work and labor relations in the adult **entertainment industry**.
According to [this]{.mark} logic of [sexual economy]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Davis, 2002), [[some bodies are **worth more** than others; yet all
are]{.mark} evaluated and [commodified]{.mark} through the lens of race,
gender, class, and, sexuality.]{.underline} Although these valuation
regimes are presentin most social and economic institutions and
relations in our society, they are iterated in explicit detail in
hardcore pornography, where [[erotic desires and fantasies are
**commercialized**]{.mark} in a \$12--14 billion dollar per year US
industry that spans the globe]{.underline} (Johnston, 2007). While the
diversification of the sex industries -- including people, products,
services, and technologies -- has transformed and expanded both
productive and consumptive practices, [the hegemony of whiteness in
defining human capital (including erotic value) **disadvantages** people
of color. The black female body is]{.underline}, in relation to other
racialized and gendered bodies in the flourishing sex industries,
[**devalued and marginalized** [in pornography's]{.mark} hierarchal,
[sexual marketplace]{.mark}]{.underline}. While many scholars have
theorized about how gender informs pornography's sexual representations
and labor relations, there is a paucity of research on how [[race forms
a **matrix**]{.mark} of power [that shapes the practices and]{.mark}
[principles of the adult entertainment industry in its visual
representation as well as its structural and social
relations]{.mark}]{.underline} (see Bernardi, 2006; Shimizu, 2007;
Williams, 2004b). In this article I examine the structural inequalities
and social biases black women face in the adult industry. Through the
oral testimonies of these workers, this study reveals that black women
in adult entertainment sustain incisive critiques about how hegemonic
whiteness impacts their conditions of labor, including earnings,
employment opportunities, and erotic embodiment. Responding to these
intersecting racial and gender hierarchies of valuation, black women sex
workers (Leigh, 1997) grapple with the devaluation of their bodies and
sexual labor, sometimes through the creation of pornography that
represents their own desires. [[What can we learn from black sex
workers' **utilization of hypersexuality**]{.mark} and
selfcommodification as they live and labor within advanced
capitalism?]{.underline} Given feminists' entrenched battles over sexual
representation and commerce, I consider the key challenges and concerns
about elucidating black sex workers' supposedly deviant or
counternormative behaviors. I illuminate black women's intimate labor in
hardcore and their struggles for survival, success, and sexual agency.
In my research methodology, which combines feminist methods of
ethnography, oral history, archival and textual analysis, [I situate
[black sex workers]{.mark} as critical knowledge producers and cultural
workers actively laboring to [create space in the sexual marketplace for
a **self-defined** black female sexuality]{.mark}]{.underline}. Engaging
black women working day to day in the sex industry, looking specifically
at their needs, experiences, challenges, and desires, [I argue that it
is precisely through women's **own discussions** of their
representations and labor in the sexual economy that we can analyze the
complexities and ambiguities of black women's experiences of pleasure
and danger, exploitation and disenchantment.]{.underline} Our
methodologies should consider how black women's labor in the sexual
economy indicates their attempts at survival, mobility, self-authorship,
and self-care (Cohen, 2004; Foucault, 1990 \[1978\]).

#### Whiteness occupies the [most valuable]{.underline} sexual capital that situates Blackness within the [sexual market]{.underline} as a [hyper-disposable]{.underline} repulsive object of exchange.

What do black women sex workers have to say about the kinds of
challenges to erotic autonomy they confront as they carve out space
within a deeply racialized and gendered sexual economy? In my study,
[black professional adult actresses have been vocal about issues of
**wage inequality**, employment marginalization, and interpersonal bias,
even as they assert their autonomy in choosing to work in the
**pornography industry**]{.underline}. In an industry that treats most
sex workers as disposable, [[black women]{.mark} are the most devalued;
they are [**hyper-disposable**. The perceived easy accessibility of
black]{.mark} women's [sexuality organizes how]{.mark}]{.underline}
hardcore [[media produces and **markets** black female bodies]{.mark} as
well as how it treats black women workers at worksites.]{.underline} I
want to foreground the voices of black women professional sex workers to
understand the function of gendered, racialized, sexuality in the
political economy of adult entertainment with regards to black female
bodies. [Black female bodies are **devalued** [in a]{.mark} [sexual
marketplace that reifies whiteness]{.mark}, especially white
femininity]{.underline} (Nagle, 1997). [[The]{.mark} young, blonde,
lithe, busty, [white woman is constructed as the most valuable **sexual
commodity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As seen at the AVN Adult Expo, [white
women's bodies are the **primary currency** of the]{.underline}
multi-billion dollar adult entertainment [business]{.underline}. They
are the focus of companies like Vivid, Hustler, and Wicked, and they are
the 'cash cows' for an industry that is immensely lucrative for major US
corporations such as AT&T, TimeWarner, and DirectTV that profit from
selling hardcore over pay-per-view cable channels, video on demand, the
internet, and in millions of hotel rooms each year (PBS Frontline,
2001a; PBS Frontline, 2001b). [Although they are fetishized for their
difference, the bodies of [women of color hold much **less
currency**]{.mark} for these corporations [because they receive
significantly **less demand**]{.mark} compared to white female bodies.
[The devalued status]{.mark}]{.underline} of black female bodies
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} significantly [[evident in **wage**
**inequalities**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and this is one of the sorest
issues for black women sex workers in the business. Concentrated in the
bastardized niche genres of black and interracial porn, [[black
actresses have]{.mark}]{.underline} largely [[been]{.underline}]{.mark}
both [[hired less and paid half]{.mark} to three quarters [of what
white]{.mark} female [actresses earn]{.mark}. Black women]{.underline}
contractors for professional companies [are currently paid
\$400--\$900]{.underline} for one 'boy/girl' sex scene, depending on
their notoriety and the company's film budget, while [white actresses
tend to be paid \$1000--\$2000]{.underline}. (Vanessa Blue, 13 August
2008). [Black]{.underline} professional [adult actresses identify
the]{.underline} problems of [pay inequality as part of a wide-ranging,
**exploitative**, and racist devaluation of their labor]{.underline}.
Actress Lola Lane pointed to the inequality and pay: 'I think I am still
not getting equal to what the other girls are getting' (Lola Lane, 10
January 2003). After years in the porn industry, Lola Lane succeeded in
demanding a higher rate from producers than when she started, but she
still felt that it was not equal to white women's pay rates. Sierra,
another professional adult actress and exotic dancer described the ways
that workers lack the knowledge of wage rates that intensifies racial
inequality: The thing is salaries aren't discussed and \[producers\] try
to get you right then and there. You have to negotiate your own salary .
. . I've talked to \[black\] girls who've gotten \$300--400 to do a
scene. I'm like \$300 is all you got? I won't even leave my house for
\$300. You must be crazy! I've known a lot of white girls that come into
the business and get started with regular straight scenes and get \$1000
. . . [Unfortunately, most of us entering this business don't know what
we're worth]{.underline} (Sierra, personal interview, 28 April 2003).
[[Vulnerable to exploitation by pornographers looking for]{.mark} the
next [new talent]{.mark} [at]{.mark} the **[cheap]{.mark}est** cost,
[young women]{.mark} entering the sex industry [are hurt by a culture of
**silence**]{.mark} about wages, exacerbated by a stigmatized and
complex field of work]{.underline}.5 While their age and lack of
knowledge about industry standards for actresses sometimes places them
at a disadvantage, full-time, professional actresses also battle to
maintain their careers in a climate that favors younger women (Diana
Devoe, personal interview, 11 January 2003). As indicated by one African
American adult industry executive, the inequality in pay is the 'primary
issue' for black actresses, and 'knowing that you could have gotten
more, is really disappointing' (Anonymous, personal interview, 5
December 2002). Beyond the issue of wages, [[these]{.mark} contract
[workers feel]{.mark} an [extreme pressure to **conform** to high
standards of whiteness]{.mark} in order [to win]{.mark} opportunities
such as film roles, marketing and PR agreements, and [long-term
contracts. The rule tends to be: live up to the requirements of white
sexual embodiment]{.mark}]{.underline}, in other words,
[**[assimilate]{.mark}** [to white **beauty standards**, or risk being
ghettoized]{.mark} in the most undervalued sectors of the
business,]{.underline} such as the low-end genre of 'ghetto porn'
(Sinnamon Love, personal interview, 5 December 2002). For Lola Lane the
obvious racism embedded in the privileging of white femininity was
painful: You know I've been booked for shoots and they think I'm white
over the phone, (because there's another Lola) and they say 'Oh you're
the black girl. We can't shoot you', or 'Your butt is too big'. So it
can hurt your feelings (Lola Lane, personal interview, 10 January 2003).
[This construction of [beauty]{.mark} and desirability [is]{.mark}
inherently [defined by what it is not -- the **deviant** and repulsive
black]{.mark} woman's [body]{.mark} -- has very real, economic
implications for women of color sex workers]{.underline}. As Lola's
testimony shows, the preference for white actresses and [the
stratification of opportunities along the color line creates a
tremendous sense of **disappointment**, frustration and injustice among
black actresses]{.underline} as they are left out of potentially
lucrative opportunities to work. You have to get that tough skin or
you're not going to make it, otherwise you get low self-esteem. You are
like 'Hey, what's wrong with me?' I go to these casting calls . . . and
they are only looking at the white girls. It's like, 'Why am I here?'
You find it humiliating (Lola Lane, personal interview, 10 January
2003). [Lola's feeling of [constantly feeling **measured**]{.mark}
[against an unattainable]{.mark} and cruel [standard of beauty]{.mark}
and femininity [is something many black women]{.mark} in America [face
everyday]{.mark}]{.underline} (Craig, 2002[). A deeply emotional process
of confrontation, pain, and self-hatred -- and sometimes
counter-hegemonic resistance and healing -- black women must negotiate
their unalterable difference and the overriding **stigma** of being a
racial Other in an industry that funnels the cultural capital of white
beauty as the primary economic **capital** of its workers]{.underline}.
According to Angel Kelly (personal interview, 20 April 2003), 'Black
women are always feeling measured by white beauty standards, and
increasingly the skinny and plastic'. Indeed, [[many]{.mark} of the
professional adult [actresses]{.mark} I interviewed had [responded to
the pressure]{.mark} to look like ideal porn stars [by having]{.mark}
some form of [**plastic surgery**.]{.mark} The increasing employment of
black women [that look like]{.mark}]{.underline}, as black adult actor
Byron Long (personal interview, 10 January 2003) [puts it, 'chocolate
[Barbie dolls']{.mark},]{.underline} has meant that black women with
more voluptuous and natural bodies tend to be seen as less attractive,
more disposable and are marginalized in niche markets like ghetto porn,
BBW (Big Beautiful Women), and fat porn. They do not appear in higher
status hardcore feature films produced by the top companies and
directors. Those women who defy the politics of disposability and fight
for a longer career in the industry attempt to project what one
production executive calls 'crossover appeal'. According to professional
adult actress Sinnamon Love (personal interview, 5 December 2002), '[the
farther away they are from the natural, voluptuous figure of a black
woman, the better it is, and the more likely they are to get the
jobs'.]{.underline} [The process of [demanding black women appear white
while]{.mark} they are still [represented as **exotic** Others]{.mark}
[sustains the **fantasy** of difference for]{.mark}]{.underline}
presumably [[white male consumers]{.mark} without disrupting the racial
order. This systemic **hierarchy of valuation** shapes working
conditions and challenges the legitimacy of [black]{.mark} women [sex
workers]{.mark}. They [must work within]{.mark}]{.underline} limited
[categories]{.underline} defined and [regulated by [a racial **economy
of desire**]{.mark}]{.underline}; those that do not fit within the
categories are kept out with evasive excuses: 'We can't shoot you right
now, but as soon as we're shooting something, we'll call you'. This was
what an employer told performer Stacy Cash (personal interview, 10
January 2004) when she called to inquire about bookings. 'But if you
send in a picture of a girl that is lighter than you', she added, 'then
they'll shoot her. It depends on what their preferences are . . . you
have to work within the category that you are in'. Stacy is not alone in
experiencing the pain of rejection due to racism and colorism -- in fact
[she is part of a global economy of desire that uses, but also
discriminates against, black and brown women]{.underline}. Kemala
Kempadoo proposes we acknowledge that, 'even with the heightened
exoticization of the sexuality of Third World women and men, they are
positioned in the global sex industry second to white women' (Kempadoo
and Doezema, 1998: 11). [Whiteness is the hegemonic ideal of
**attractiveness and desirability**, Kempadoo argues, 'and white sexual
labor is most valued within the global sex industry']{.underline} (1998:
11).

#### Pornography provides a unique space in the field of [sexual commerce]{.underline} to retain [autonomy, deviancy, and respect]{.underline} for Black women.

[Black women struggle to employ tactics of everyday
**survival**]{.underline} and labor [within the]{.underline} parameters
of a **[racialized sexual economy]{.underline}**, focusing on gaining
opportunities, mobility, and power by working within the system. There
are some entrepreneurial actresses that are also actively reforming
black women's traditional roles as sex workers by becoming hardcore
directors, producers, agents, and webmistresses. [[Using hardcore as a
space for **selffashioning**]{.mark} and self-promotion, [these]{.mark}
cultural [workers create their own]{.mark} [pornographies. Vanessa
Blue]{.mark}]{.underline}, who [learned filmmaking and built an editing
studio in her home by reading 'how-to' books, has [directed]{.mark} 20
[hardcore]{.mark} [videos]{.mark} and dozens of digital short films.
Vanessa is part of a **new emergence** of black women]{.underline}
[professional performers becoming directors]{.underline}, including
Diana Devoe, Sinnamon Love, and Marie Luv. In feature adult films like
Dark Confessions, Taking Memphis, and Black Reign, [[Vanessa creates
**representations**]{.mark} that attempt [to]{.mark} [highlight the
**erotic** **power**]{.mark} and beauty [of the women]{.mark} in the
images, [while sustaining an **ethical**]{.mark} working [environment
for sex workers]{.mark}, especially women]{.underline}. As a director,
Vanessa is adamant about paying her performers the rates they request
and never pressuring them to take on sex acts or situations they are
uncomfortable with[. [By]{.mark} [authoring]{.mark} illicit [erotic
texts that]{.mark} represent and [**reimagine** the desires]{.mark} and
fantasies [of black sexual subjects, Vanessa produces a space for black
eroticism **beyond** the framework of **stereotyped** black
sexuality]{.mark} dominant in traditional porn]{.underline}, such as in
My Baby Got Back, South Central Hookers and Ghetto Gaggers. Vanessa
(personal interview, 13 August 2008) asserts: 'I always loved porn and I
always wanted to make it and to be a part of it. I liked watching people
be free and enjoy themselves, and I liked shooting it. I always wanted
to be behind the camera . . . \[I thought to myself\] "Let me see if I
can become the director!"' [Vanessa Blue represents how [black women may
take up]{.mark} [pornography]{.mark}, and all its challenges,
[in]{.mark} fascinating and **[transformative]{.mark}** new [ways
for]{.mark} work, [identity formation]{.mark}, and **sexual
expression**. This]{.underline} essay focuses on black professional
adult entertainment actresses, but [has implications for other **sex
workers**, especially those marginalized and disciplined by
pornography's **racial economy of desire**. [Because pornography's
hierarchies of value privilege]{.mark} a very narrow definition of
[**white** femininity]{.mark} as the object of the gaze, [women of color
work in]{.mark} peripheral and [**precarious** locations. Their
representations]{.mark} and experiences]{.underline} as sex workers
[[are shaped by a racialized]{.mark} and gendered [**sexual commerce**
where stereotypes]{.mark}]{.underline}, structural inequalities, [[and
**social biases** are the norm]{.underline}]{.mark}. As I described in
my field notes of the AVN Adult Expo and my research into discrimination
and bias in their work, [[black women are devalued as]{.mark}
**hyperaccessible and [superdisposable]{.mark}** []{.mark}in an industry
that simultaneously invests in and marginalizes fantasies about black
sexuality]{.underline}. As black women labor to make the presentation of
their presumed hypersexuality work for them, they face a myriad painful
choices and challenges. In light of feminist arguments that these women
are victimized by an alienating and exploitative sex industry, I have
attempted to show that [[black]{.mark} illicit [erotic workers,]{.mark}
while victimized by multiple axes of discrimination and harm, also
[employ an **outlaw sexuality** to achieve mobility, erotic autonomy,
and self-care]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} We should do more to shape
our studies so that they engage not just with the images that the
hardcore industry sells, but the women that are working hard to be seen
and heard. The informants in this study feel further alienated by
feminist scholars that talk about them, but not to them, and who see
them as colluding with misogynists rather than carving out a vital space
for black women to see themselves as desirable and desiring subjects.
[These women's **narratives** about and critiques of racism and sexism
in the sex industry are valuable to understanding their interventions as
performers and laborers to lay claim to legitimacy for all sex workers.
Taking on new roles as directors and producers, black women are agents
in a **transforming** sex industry. [By embracing the
**counternormative** work of deviance, hypersexuality, and
self-commodification]{.mark} in order [to survive]{.mark} under
capitalism, [they seek]{.mark} pleasure, [recognition, and
respect.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[There has been a [long history of interconnections between Dalits and
African Americans]{.mark}]{.underline}. Especially from the middle of
the nineteenth century, [some [non-Brahman and Dalit leaders attempted
to connect with Blacks]{.mark} in the United States, [not only as
victims but also in their political commitment]{.mark} to attack
ideologies and practices of caste, race, gender, and sexuality
discrimination]{.underline}. The non-Brahman leader Jotirao Phule
(1827-1890) was aware of the American Revolution and the Civil War, as
well as the atrocities committed against the Negro. He had read the life
story of George Washington and works by Thomas Paine. [[Phule]{.mark}
even [gave the title]{.mark} Gulamgiri, or \"[slavery]{.mark},\" [to his
1873 tract]{.mark} focusing on the plight of Sudras (peasants) and
Dalits battling with Brahmanic hegemony. Similarly, the intellectual B.
R. [Ambedkar]{.mark} (1891-1956) and other Dalit leaders [analyzed
slavery and subordination and often compared race with caste because to
them slavery was a powerful metaphor for caste]{.mark} (Ambedkar 1989a,
1989b).]{.underline} In the middle of the twentieth century, [[Ambedkar
expressed solidarity with Black Americans by sending to the African
American sociologist and public intellectual W. E. B. Du Bois a copy of
a letter he had directed to the U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations on the
elimination of caste and racial attitudes. Further, in 1972, Dalits were
inspired to found the Dalit Panther Party, modeled on the Black Panther
Party.]{.underline} Sociologists since the 1930s, anthropologists from
the 1940s, and a few historians have explored theoretical and concrete
aspects of comparison between Dalits and Blacks (Tartakov 2009; Myrdal
1944; Cox 1945; de Reuck and Knight 1967; Prashad 2000,2008; Aston 2001;
Ambedkar 1989a, 1989b; Pandey 2013). [Social activists such as V. T.
[Rajshekar]{.mark} (1987) also [began their \"historic collaboration\"
with African Americans in 1987 to internationalize the Dalit
problem]{.mark} [and invite the attention of the \"whole Black
world]{.mark}.\" In a similar vein, in 2003, [activists from]{.mark} the
Dalit Freedom Network ([DFN]{.mark}) [spoke before the U.S. House of
Rep]{.mark}resentatives on the topic \"India\'s Unfinished Agenda:

[role]{.mark} to play in this initiative. Moreover, in 2007, the [U.S.
Congress]{.mark} passed House Concur rent Resolution 139, \"expressing
the sense of the Congress that the United States should [address]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} ongoing [problem of untouchability in
India]{.mark}\"]{.underline} (\"African Americans to \'Declare

Americans engaged in a collaborative effort with DFN to commemorate what
would have been the eighty-fifth birth day of Martin Luther King
Jr.]{.mark} with a historic event: they joined congressional members and
staff to sign a \"Declaration of Empathy,\" which addressed the
oppression of Dalits in India.4]{.underline} However, both scholarly and
activist attempts to connect Dalits and Blacks have been largely
produced by and confined to men alone. In a few cases, when they have
turned to Dalit and Black women (Pandey 2013), the latter are not seen
as active actors or in actual conversation with each other (Paik 2014b).
I deepen these studies by rethinking history to produce a critical
analysis of the intimate connections between caste and gen der
oppressions. A quick glance at the available literature reveals that
(male) main stream approaches have rarely commented on the particular
concerns of Dalit and African American women and issues of gender and
sexuality. Only one study in 2007 by social psychologists Ramaswami
Mahalingam and Pamela T. Reid has attempted to cross international and
multiple other boundaries to construct a dialogue and encourage
interconnected ness between African American and Dalit women in order to
expand their awareness of their issues. Building on these efforts my
essay offers a deeper analysis of Dalit and African American women\'s
experiences in particular socio-historical contexts.

### Dalit -- Black Solidarity/Connection

#### Black violence is interconnected with Dalit violence.

\"Racial and caste oppression have many similarities,\" Conversation,
<http://theconversation.com/racial-and-caste-oppression-have-many-similarities-37710)//pshah>

Comparisons can be risky, but not impossible. Consider for a moment
India's Dalits, or "untouchables," and African Americans. [[Racial
inequality in America has]{.mark} its [parallel in caste inequality in
India]{.mark} even though by definition, race and caste are not the same
thing. The [story of one struggle for social justice]{.mark} can
[illuminate the pitfalls and prospects of success of
another]{.mark}.]{.underline} As a researcher in applied ethics, human
rights and global development studies, I am leading an ongoing research
effort that will compare and contrast the nature of exclusion and
marginalization faced by African Americans and Dalit Indians in their
respective historical and contemporary contexts. [The Dalit story
Although the Indian constitution bans discrimination on the basis of
caste, the social, religious and cultural practice of "untouchability"
continues unabated. Formerly known as "[untouchables]{.mark}," Dalits
[are excluded from social and public spaces]{.mark}, [prevented from
drawing water]{.mark} from public facilities and segregated in schools.
Since the caste system was formed over 2,000 years ago, a noticeable
percentage of the [200 million "Dalits" have been thrust into the lowest
occupations]{.mark} of society, [such as scavengers and sanitation
cleaners]{.mark}, with little upward mobility]{.underline}. While there
has been some progress since India's independence from the British
Empire, the pace of economic growth in mitigating social inequality has
been uneven. So, in an Indian nation that is rapidly modernizing and
urbanizing, opportunities for the Dalits still remain limited. The
degradation and the health risks of performing menial tasks are
substantial. Furthermore, with the rise of Hindu fundamentalism in
national politics, the continuous expansion of liberty and equality of
opportunity is by no means a foregone conclusion. Discrimination,
exclusion, privilege One can draw parallels in different systems of
oppression[. [Despite]{.mark} 50 years having passed since the [Civil
Rights]{.mark} movement, [the condition]{.mark} of the majority
[of]{.mark} poor, urban [African Americans is dire]{.mark}, and [chances
for survival are diminishing]{.mark} over time while the [prison
pipeline is increasing]{.mark}. Let's look at how both caste and racial
discrimination perpetuate hierarchy, privilege, discrimination,
marginalization and exclusion. Data from the last few years show [27% of
African Americans at the poverty line]{.mark}, which is much higher than
other groups. In India, [the condition of Dalits]{.mark} has been
extremely [dire for centuries]{.mark}.]{.underline} Several African
American economists in the US have looked at structural and
institutional forms of racial exclusion in terms of wealth and poverty.
[They have also opened a dialogue with economists in South Asia, where
exclusion and inequality relate to caste]{.underline}. Although some
progress was made in the 20th century that allowed greater inclusivity
and equity -- particularly in higher education -- many issues remain
despite constitutional bans on caste discrimination. [In America,
cultural and political segregation of the public space continues to
occur despite anti-segregation laws. For example, there are [concerns
among some Supreme Court justices that redistricting of voting districts
can lead to further racial inequality]{.mark}. In India, [Dalits in
rural villages are forbidden near Hindu temples]{.mark} or disallowed
with their shoes on in higher-caste neighborhoods.]{.underline} [[Mob
violence is committed]{.mark} against them with impunity, and a
disproportionate number of [rapes]{.mark} are [committed against Dalit
women]{.mark}. In comparison, post-Civil War [white mob violence against
blacks has morphed into]{.mark} what one could describe as the
state-condoned violence of [homicides]{.mark} of African Americans [by
police]{.mark} today.]{.underline} [As of June, out of 467 Americans
nationwide who had been killed by cops since the beginning of 2015, 136
were African American. How race and caste work Looking at exclusion in
America forces us to grapple with issues of violence against African
Americans, racial inequality and racial injustice at a time that is
often deemed "post-racial," namely, five decades after the Civil Rights
movement. We see a [similar pattern in India]{.mark}, wherein the
[Dalits are asked to believe that the Indian constitution bans
discrimination]{.mark}, even [though it does not abolish]{.mark} the
[caste system]{.mark} itself. It is after the successes of the African
American Civil Rights movement that we have witnessed the birth of the
school-to-prison pipeline, state violence against a disproportionate
number of African American men in police killings, and the turning back
of affirmative action at public universities in some states'
constitutional amendments, such as Michigan. Meanwhile, with right wing
conservative political power [in India, caste discrimination is
intensifying]{.mark}. For example, [Dalit Christians and Dalit Muslims
are not eligible for reservations, or what]{.mark} we in the [US would
call affirmative action]{.mark} benefits at universities,
[because]{.mark} technically "[untouchability" exists only in
Hinduism]{.mark},]{.underline} when in social reality it occurs across
religions in India. Historically, both race and caste have been used to
divide society in many ways to the unfair advantage of certain groups
over others. Again, there are similarities in the construction of how
people have been forced into these categories. [Here [in
America]{.mark}, [people are born into a "race]{.mark}," and America
uses race [as a defining demographic]{.mark} category in its census.
Biological race by nature, for now, is inescapable, even though some
would say that "race" is an artificial category that is socially
constructed. [Dalits]{.mark}, too, [are born into a caste, which is
unaltera]{.mark}ble, as [they are told]{.mark}, and [it is due to the
sins of a previous life]{.mark} that they are paying the price in their
current life.]{.underline} Hinduism believes in the transmigration of
the soul, in which the soul enters a new body after death. The caste
that one enters into depends upon the actions of a previous life. The
two democracies should learn from each other So how can the US and India
learn from each other in order to solve some of the most pressing
problems for the world's two largest democracies, both of which consider
themselves secular and free? If nations can cooperate on trade and
development, there is no reason that they cannot participate in a global
dialogue on minority rights through the lens of their religious,
cultural and social heritages. They must learn to come to grips with the
fact that the mere assertion of a democratic society does not
necessarily translate in to a free and equal one. Modern democratic
superpowers with sizable national wealth, such as the US and India, also
have a dark side, involving what some would consider gross human rights
violations. My work will set out to explore how different democracies
can promote tolerance, inclusion and pluralism while combating various
forms of discrimination and exclusion based on race and caste. The
question will be how to evaluate the claim that both societies make, as
the two largest, most "peaceful and successful" democracies in the
world.

### DPP Key

#### The 1AC neglects the Dalit Panther Party which worked to change notions of "untouchability" through a campaign of EDUCATION of Shudras and Dalits and encouragement of guerilla resistance. Only the DPP can serve as a model for escaping civil society through distancing Dalits from Hinduism.

to many parts of India. He also [worked to abolish]{.mark} the [idea of
"untouchability,"]{.mark} [which meant getting rid of restrictions on
entry into temples]{.mark}, and finding a place for Dalits within
Hinduism (Sekhon, 48). After 1910, however, Dalit leaders started
focusing on distancing themselves from Hinduism and began to advocate
for a separate electorate for the Dalits.]{.underline} But Gandhi, who
was one of the leaders of the Indian National Congress, tried to instead
encourage the incorporation of Dalits as part of reformed Hinduism.
[Another prominent movement was the Dalit movement under B.R.
[Ambedkar]{.mark}, which began between the 1920s and 1930s. He
[campaigned for]{.mark} greater [rights]{.mark} for Dalits in British
India, and even after independence (Sekhon, 48). Both Ambedkar and
Gandhi were advocates for the abolishment of the caste system, but they
disagreed on the means to go about it. [Gandhi believed "untouchability
to be a moral issue]{.mark} that could be abolished through goodwill and
change of heart among the upper-caste Hindus]{.underline}" (Sekhon,
48[). [Ambedkar]{.mark}, however, [believed that "the subordination of
Dalits was primarily economic and political, and could only be overcome
by changing the social structure through legal, political, and
educational means"]{.mark} (Sekhon, 48). Ambedkar did receive
constitutional guarantees after independence that reserved a certain
percentage of seats in elections for Dalits, but by the mid-1950s,
[Ambedkar]{.mark} was not satisfied by the rate of implementation of the
measures. He therefore [resigned from government and began to recruit
Dalits to seek rights]{.mark}. In [1956, he encouraged around six
million Dalits to convert to Buddhism "as a means of escaping the social
stigma of untouchability within the Hindu caste system]{.mark}" (Sekhon,
49). During the 1970s, [the Dalit Panthers movement sprouted up among
the younger generation of Dalits along with other social movements in
India]{.mark}, and their movement expressed their anger and frustration
at the failure of implementation regarding policies that would eliminate
acts of violence against Dalits by upper-caste Hindus in many parts of
urban and rural India (Sekhon, 49).]{.underline}

Like our middle-class Hmong American participants, our [low-income Hmong
American]{.underline} participants and those who work closely with these
communities, [are deeply concerned with the invisibility of Hmong
Americans]{.underline} in Dane County. Mee, a youth coordinator for an
advocacy group that works with Southeast Asian and Black communities in
Dane County (SHOUT), expressed her frustration regarding the way [[the
model minority stereotype **masks the concerns of Hmong
people**]{.underline}]{.mark}: I still think that [a lot of people don't
know who Hmong folks are. I think that a lot of people still think that
we are East Asian, Chinese folks right? And that we fit into the model
minority myth.]{.underline} Yeah, I think... that if they do think about
Hmong people they think, I think they think about the model minority
folks right. Really trying to put us into that box. Mee goes on to
assert that Hmong Americans are not model minorities: But I think we
look at those statistics right, and we take out SEA folks from that,
when we look at it, we see that [**[SEA folks are]{.mark} [the complete
opposite of the]{.mark} model minority [myth]{.mark}.** That we are not
doing well at all. **We are actually really poor, we are not graduating
high school and college**.]{.underline} All of that right.
Interestingly, Mee suggests that [Hmong American middle-class
professionals]{.underline} may [unintentionally confirm the model
minority stereotype in the eyes of the dominant society]{.underline}
through their advocacy work. In the following quote she argued that
middle-class Hmong leaders are not the only leaders in the community:
Hmong leadership does not only come from young people who are
professionals, right. And that it's um, that Hmong leaders comes in all
shapes and forms. And that in reality at SHOUT, a lot of the Hmong
leaders, a lot of folks that we think are Hmong leaders are elderly
Hmong women. They are the ones that we go to, um for like, they are the
one that we go to because they know whose family has not eaten, whose
family does not have clothes, and whose families needs help right. And
yeah, I think a lot of people look at elderly Hmong women and think that
they are stupid and they don't have anything to contribute and they
don't know anything. Right, and that actually, they think that they are
a burden to the city and the state right. But in reality they have the
most wisdom and they know the most about what the community needs. Mee
and our other [[low-income Hmong American]{.underline}]{.mark}
participants [are overtly critical of the model minority
stereotype,]{.underline} [and they]{.underline} also [[recognize that
the model minority stereotype]{.underline}]{.mark} [implicitly [compares
Asian Americans to other groups of color]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Specifically, [Mee argues]{.underline} that as [Asian Americans, [Hmong
Americans experience **relative racial privilege compared to Black
people**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} In support of her position, s[he
points to the **[disciplinary practices at schools]{.mark} that [target
Black students for behaviors that go unpunished when performed by
Asian]{.mark}** and White **[students.]{.mark}** Meng]{.underline}, a
youth leader at SHOUT, [also]{.underline} [expressed a recognition that
Whites view **Hmong Americans more positively than** they view **Black
people**:]{.underline} They ([Whites]{.underline}) [see us differently
from black people]{.underline}, I [think. **They always say**, "oh we
have good food, you know. We behave well, **we behave better than black
folks**.]{.underline} We have good grades or I don't know that we're
healthy." Mee and other members of SHOUT argue that efforts to perform a
[**[model minority image]{.mark}** represent a consent to hegemonic
racial discourses that **[damage both the Hmong American community and
the Black community]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Lee, 2009). In the following
quote, Mee asserted that [**[Hmong people should not strive to become
model minorities]{.mark}**:]{.underline} It ([**[the]{.mark} model
minority [stereotype) is just feeding into]{.mark} the system of [White
supremacy]{.mark}**[, not only that, but **the**]{.mark} **model
minority [myth is very anti-Black]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Everything
about [**[the model minority myth is being white, becoming White and
being the furthest thing from black.]{.mark}** We should not try to be
the model minority at all. It's like we are trying to fit into the
system, and **[the system is]{.mark} just [using the model
minority]{.mark} as a tool [to keep us down]{.mark}**]{.underline}. So
that it can keep on working its magic. Mee's critique of [the model
minority]{.underline} stereotype [highlights the anti-Blackness implicit
in the discourse. She recognizes]{.underline} that the model minority
discourse is implicitly comparative in nature, and that [there cannot be
a model minority without a]{.underline} concomitant [problematic
minority]{.underline} (Lee, 2009; Poon et al., 2015). Mee and other
[Southeast Asian]{.underline} members of SHOUT [have developed close
relationships with low-income Black people]{.underline} through their
work in SHOUT. Through their experiences working with SHOUT, [Mee has
seen firsthand the ways that race and class intersect with other
identities in the lives of low-income communities]{.underline}, and
[she]{.underline} has come to [recognize that [low-income Black and
Southeast Asians face shared forms of marginalization.
Mee]{.mark}]{.underline} and other members of SHOUT [[argue for **an
intersectional approach to challenging**]{.mark} the multiple forms of
**[oppression faced by]{.mark}** members of the **low-income [Black and
Southeast Asian American]{.mark} communities**]{.underline} in Dane
County. Thus, Mee\'s critique of the model minority stereotype is based
on her commitment to building cross-racial coalitions with other
low-income communities of color.

History of Struggle Should Unite India's Dalits and African Americans in
the Fight for Equality,\" Root,
<https://www.theroot.com/1796017503)//pshah>

[For more than 4,000 years, the [Dalits]{.mark} of India were [called
"the untouchables,"]{.mark} the lowest of the low. The [Dalits are at
the bottom of the Indian caste hierarchy]{.mark} and are currently the
oldest surviving oppressed group in the world. [They suffer the worst of
human miseries]{.mark} and were once deemed impure and polluted human
beings]{.underline}. Even though they are separated by geography, the
Dalits and African Americans have a similar story in the struggle for
equality. [Like African Americans during slavery, Jim Crow and today, in
the era of the Black Lives Matter movement, the Dalits are outcasts who
continue to bear the brunt of being born in the wrong social
order.]{.underline} This shared history of oppression was not lost on
two prominent figures of the 20th century, who came together to rally
for each other's cause. [In July 1946, B.R. [Ambedkar]{.mark}, a
colossal figure in the anti-untouchability movement in India, [wrote a
letter to]{.mark} W.E.B. [Du Bois]{.mark} to [ask him for a copy
of]{.mark} Du Bois' [petition submitted to the United Nations]{.mark} on
behalf of black Americans. Ambedkar hoped to follow suit on behalf of
the untouchables. Du Bois, in his response to Ambedkar, acknowledged
Ambedkar's epochal work and expressed his desire to aid in the cause of
India's untouchables. [Ambedkar and Du Bois tried to work together to
put India and the United States on trial for the violation of human
rights of the Dalit and black people]{.mark}. It is noteworthy that
[Ambedkar entrusted the fate]{.mark} of then-60 million untouchables [to
Du Bois]{.mark}.]{.underline} Ambedkar did not find it necessary to
approach anyone else, including the newly independent nation-states in
Southeast Asia, where he had friendly relations. Instead, Ambedkar
approached his fellow black intellectual to prepare a challenge for the
U.N. to address the untouchables' suffering. Although the practice of
untouchability is now outlawed, [the [Dalits]{.mark} continue to [suffer
socially, politically, economically and culturally]{.mark}. The Dalits
[are assigned the filthiest jobs]{.mark}, such [as cleaning human
excreta]{.mark}---which is indicative of a prefixed caste---[or tanning
animal skins]{.mark}, all [done with nonprotective
gear]{.mark}.]{.underline} Adding to the humiliation, [[they are]{.mark}
paid close to [nothing]{.mark}. The 200 million Dalits suffer at the
hands of several political forces, which is why, despite the generous
constitutional provisions to protect and uplift the Dalits, census data
shows that only [2.24 percent of Dalits graduate from college]{.mark}
every year]{.underline}. [[Speaking up against the caste system]{.mark}
can [cost lives and invite violence to the whole community]{.mark}, as
has happened time and time again. Hence, the [Dalit ghettos are often
the targets of communal violence]{.mark}, continued [state
suppression]{.mark} [and]{.mark} a [social sanction]{.mark} against
their welfare]{.underline}. This is why it's time that the Dalit agenda
became part of a mainstream discourse in black and other solidarity
organizations. Like the Movement for Black Lives, the Dalit movement is
being led by courageous and visionary Dalit women. [The global
[approaches of Ambedkar and Du Bois]{.mark} must [serve as an
inspiration]{.mark} in the fight [against white supremacy and Brahmin
supremacy]{.mark}---as well as against classism, sexism and empire.
Unfortunately, there is still no U.N. General Assembly resolution that
specifically denounces the caste system]{.underline}. There is also no
single nongovernmental organization or U.N.-affiliated civil society
group that exclusively tackles the issues of the global caste system,
like race, gender, sexuality and colonialism. This suggests that the
existences of over 300 million people affected by the caste system
globally are invisible to the world and the U.N. A Dalit lives his or
her life without being acknowledged, let alone noticed and recognized.
In these times, when new solidarities are created across the spectrum,
the plight of the Dalits needs to be incorporated into the larger
social-protest culture. [The [African-American struggle]{.mark} is not
solely local; it is also global, with [links to other movements]{.mark}.
The prophetic spirits of Ambedkar and Du Bois must come alive as never
before. The Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues
relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from
all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our
editorial staff.]{.underline}

#### Movement solidarity good.

**Jefferson '08** (Antonette Jefferson, M.A. Ph.D. Student, Howard
University, Washington, D.C. July 2008, "The Rhetoric of Revolution: The
Black Consciousness Movement and the Dalit Panther Movement,"
<http://www.jpanafrican.org/docs/vol2no5/2.5_The_Rhetoric_of_Revolution.pdf>)//RV

The development of the Dalit Movement and Black Consciousness movement
stemmed from various discriminatory and racist practices that created an
intense irritation in the people, an irritation that incited them to
action. [**[Misguided interpretations of human rights declarations and
bills of rights in Indian society denied Dalits certain rights by
concluding that Dalits were not human beings and thus not entitled to
the rights of such declarations, bills and
constitutions]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Dalits have been and continue to
be forced to slums without basic humanitarian conditions. In South
Africa, only whites had political power because black South Africans
were denied citizenship. Such acts as the Native Land Act restricted
land ownership where only 7.2% of the land was allotted to blacks while
whites owned the remaining land (MacDonald, 2006). Whites also
restricted the movements of blacks through the pass laws (MacDonald,
2006). [[These existing conditions set the tone for the revolutionary
rhetoric and movement of the mid to late twentieth
century.]{.mark}]{.underline} The environment had indeed been hostile;
the response, nevertheless, has been an amalgamation of the spiritual,
intellectual, and emotional. What MacDonald (2006) notes is that [the
white South African government, the National Party, forced blacks to
revolutionary action.]{.underline} The National Party ruled with such a
heavy hand that the only recourse South Africans were afforded were
revolutionary strategies, as seen in the Soweto Rebellion of 1976
(Africans in townships rebelling against poor housing and economic
conditions, as well as political disenfranchisement) (MacDonald, 2006).
Similarly, the Sharpeville Massacre (the government violently suppressed
Africans protesting pass laws), indicated the strategy South Africans
would take to have their needs met (Biko, 2004). [[Physical violence
became the outcome of the fight against oppression in these instances
and yet what must also be taken into consideration is the language and
rhetorical strategies of the leaders of the Dalit Panther Movement and
the Black Consciousness Movement]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Endorse the model of the Dalit Panther Party.

**Jefferson '08** (Antonette Jefferson, M.A. Ph.D. Student, Howard
University, Washington, D.C. July 2008, "The Rhetoric of Revolution: The
Black Consciousness Movement and the Dalit Panther Movement,"
<http://www.jpanafrican.org/docs/vol2no5/2.5_The_Rhetoric_of_Revolution.pdf>)//RV

[[The Dalit Panther Movement which has been reshaped over the years
retains the fiery rhetoric of revolution as seen in current literature
of the Dalit Panthers]{.mark}.]{.underline} One proclamation of
contemporary Dalit Panther Party rhetoric as indicated by Dalit
Oppression states: [**We will not be satisfied easily now. We do not
want a little piece in the Brahmin...We want the rule of the whole
land**. We are not looking at persons but at a system. Change of heart,
liberal education, etc., will not end our state of exploitation. [When
we gather a revolutionary mass, rouse the people, out of the struggle of
this giant mass will come the tidal wave of
revolution]{.mark}.]{.underline} The level of passion demonstrated in
this excerpt typifies the response of oppressed people to their
conditions[. **[It no longer becomes acceptable to accept concessions
and compromise with conservative elites who encourage marginalized
people to be patient with process.]{.underline}**]{.mark} Rather,
[revolutionaries begin to take measured steps to make their demands
known and to bring those demands to material manifestation]{.underline}.
Instrumental in the rhetoric and strategies of the liberation movements
has also been the illumination of what will be termed here the
"friend-enemies" of their respective movements. Biko's friend-enemies
are white liberals and Ambedkar's, Gandhism. [[One of the tools of
persuasion and liberation rightly used is the dismantling of the
disguises of the "enemy]{.mark}."]{.underline} Biko and Ambedkar hold a
light to the pseudo-benevolent actions of these friend-enemies. They
identify the ideologies and motivations that may have deleterious
consequences for the masses of oppressed people in their fight for
liberation**[. As in the United States, the whites have the privilege,
cleavage and comfort of a racist society whereby they can live
vicariously through liberation movements of the oppressed without
sacrificing their own comfortable accommodations.]{.underline}**

#### AT State Good and White Liberalism.

**Jefferson '08** (Antonette Jefferson, M.A. Ph.D. Student, Howard
University, Washington, D.C. July 2008, "The Rhetoric of Revolution: The
Black Consciousness Movement and the Dalit Panther Movement,"
<http://www.jpanafrican.org/docs/vol2no5/2.5_The_Rhetoric_of_Revolution.pdf>)//RV

**[Biko acknowledges that [it is impossible for the oppressor to fight
the system of oppression that gives it its
privilege.]{.mark}]{.underline}** To what extent is it desirable to rid
oneself of power so that another race may have equality, where the
threat of role reversal is imminent, and where the racist classed
society is the basis of economic, political and cultural institutions
and systems? These are the inevitable considerations of whites
generally, whether subconscious or conscious, whether conservative or
liberal. Biko astutely states the position of the white liberal and why
the white liberal cannot fight the struggle for Blacks: **[[The liberal
is in fact appeasing his own consciousness or at best is eager to
demonstrate his identification with the black people only so far as it
does not sever all his ties with his relatives on the other side of the
colour line]{.mark}. Being white he possesses the natural passport to
the exclusive pool of white privileges...yet since he identifies with
the blacks, he moves around his white circles...with a lighter load,
feeling that he is not like the rest, yet at the back of his mind is a
constant reminder that he is quite comfortable as things stand and
therefore should not bother about change. (p. 71) Thus, Biko has
[uncover]{.mark}ed [the false pretenses of white liberals, whose
liberalism can have a detrimental effect on the cause of Black
liberation.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Rhetorical Transnationalism is key.

**Jefferson '08** (Antonette Jefferson, M.A. Ph.D. Student, Howard
University, Washington, D.C. July 2008, "The Rhetoric of Revolution: The
Black Consciousness Movement and the Dalit Panther Movement,"
<http://www.jpanafrican.org/docs/vol2no5/2.5_The_Rhetoric_of_Revolution.pdf>)//RV

[[The rhetoric and action of the Black Consciousness Movement and the
Dalit Panther Movement set precedence for future liberation movements.
By understanding the recipe for the political and social movement of the
oppressed]{.mark}, it becomes possible also to understand the oppressor
and the institutional oppression that threatens the
Diaspora.]{.underline} These movements existed in a hostile environment
in which oppression was political, cultural and economic. Therefore, the
leaders and influential actors in these movements, namely Biko and
Ambedkar recognized the global import of their actions and the common
oppression of people of African descent. [Thus, the strategies [were
connected and comparable.]{.mark} They spoke of "friend-enemies,"
self-empowerment, global struggle, fallacious religious teachings---[all
to highlight the abysmal conditions of these predicaments as well as the
hope of liberation. These movements did not exist in a vacuum and future
movements will also be connected.]{.mark} People of African descent must
recognize the international and transnational implications of moving as
a collective and must develop strategies and movements that will address
the unique nuances of a connected world.]{.underline} As there is a
continuing investigation of revolution and continuing agitation of
change, there will be need to move from mobilization to organization[.
[Understanding the rhetorical strategies that have been used gives a
gauge of the successes and challenges of revolution, and while
revolution is more than words, words (and experiences) are what raise
consciousness and make action possible.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### Alt -- Conscientization 

#### Conscientization is key -- it allows understanding of historical and social-structural forces that results in nonviolent spaces for communal reckoning. 

**Osajima '07** "Replenishing the Ranks: Raising Critical Consciousness
Among Asian Americans", https://muse.jhu.edu/article/213033

[[Given the profound change that conscientization had effected]{.mark}
in the lives of respondents, it is not surprising that many of them
wanted to be in positions where they could help to create for others the
educational experiences that were so meaningful to them. [They took
leadership positions]{.mark} in student organizations; [they helped to
organize and put on educational programs;]{.mark} [they worked in
community organizations]{.mark}; they pursued graduate studies; and
[they took positions in student affairs to work closely with new cohorts
of Asian American students]{.mark}.]{.underline} Pamela Kim, who wanted
to become a professor of Asian American studies, best expresses their
desire: One of the reasons why I want to be a professor of Asian
American Studies is because I want to help these kids who are going
through the same things that I did. I want to help them figure things
out, to help educate them about these issues because I had no idea about
them while I was growing up. I could see what these kids are all going
through in college, and it helps to be where you can pop those bubbles
that they have around themselves.37 [As they go about [the task of
trying to replenish the ranks by raising critical consciousness
amongst]{.mark} new groups of [Asians]{.mark}, a number of lessons
learned from their collective [experiences]{.mark} may provide helpful
guides. From the interviews, [we can identify critical elements that
contribute to conscientizatio]{.mark}n.]{.underline} While these
elements do not guarantee that conscientization will follow,
incorporating them into one\'s practice may enhance the possibility that
efforts will be successful. [[First]{.mark}, respondents described the
importance of [obtaining information and conceptual tools that helped
them to]{.mark} cognitively [understand how their lives and the lives of
others are shaped by larger historical and social-structural]{.mark}
\[End Page 74\] [forces.]{.mark} An Asian American Studies course on a
college campus was the most common source of relevant information, but
as we have seen [exposure can take place in many venues. People can
learn]{.mark} [from]{.mark} reading on their own, from [student
groups]{.mark}, and from multimedia sources. [Second,]{.mark} [breaking
through isolation and interrupting the tendency to explain]{.mark} their
[life experiences solely in individual terms reflects a social
dimension]{.mark} to conscientization]{.underline}. Contact and
conversation with other Asian Americans was often the most effective way
to help respondents make connections between their lives, the
experiences of others, and information on the Asian American experience.
[[Connections to]{.mark} key [mentors and peers provided
a]{.mark}]{.underline} safe [[environment in which to think and question
further.]{.underline}]{.mark} [Third, respondents described important
affective aspects of conscientization. When respondents talked about
important moments in their education or key social support that made a
difference, invariably they referred to how they felt about these
experiences. They were angered by the realization that their schooling
had not taught them about racism or the Asian American
experience.]{.underline}

### AT -- Gender and Sex

#### Alt solves -- the Dalit/Black solidarity movement brings gender and sex to the forefront. 

**Shailaja '14** (Shailaja Paik is Associate Professor of History at

Dalits are not a homogenous community[. [Constructing solidarity was
tenuous]{.mark} in practice because [Dalits were fractured along lines
of linguistic, cultural, regional, and caste differences]{.mark}. A
collective mentality certainly favored Dalit militancy and a united
struggle for the Bahishkrut Samaaj (Community of the Excluded),
especially in the existing contingent political conditions; yet there
were contradictions in other ideologies of pro test, for example,
religious conversion (Paik 2014a). Moreover, [problems of
gender]{.mark}, class, and caste [have continued to stifle the practice
of solidarity]{.mark} [within Dalit communities. Similarly, African
Americans have faced internal dissent in terms of gender]{.mark} and
class.]{.underline} Such challenges affect practices of political
solidarity on many levels: community, regional, national, and even
transnational[. Yet I argue that thinking, speaking, and working margin
to margin will allow us to conceive of liminality as a space of
solidarity, [to \"acknowledge and address questions of power and
oppression]{.mark} among and across different margins\" [and engage in a
\"new politics of difference that accounts for the difficulties women at
the margins confront when they attempt to find common ground and build
\[]{.mark}vigorous horizontal\] alliances.\"2 [Dalit and African
American women\'s collective ideas]{.mark}, comparisons, and learning
and coping strategies will allow us to build some connections and
solidarity between the two dispossessed communities.]{.underline}
[[Third world feminists have theoretically attempted to work across
national borders, but in practice we have yet to mobilize gender as a
means to interrogate cultural boundaries between Dalit and African
American women]{.mark}. Although each of the two communities is unique,
knowledge of their shared battles is essential to frame the political
solidarity I am advocating for. For example, [the journey of naming
among Dalit communities and the term \"Dalit\" itself is comparable to
African Americans moving]{.mark} from the term Negroes [to Blacks and
then to African Americans as accepted terms relating to their
identity]{.mark}]{.underline} (Paik 2011). The struggle to break out of
the negative stereotypes imposed by dominant groups and to demand
greater respect is well illustrated by the history of the civil rights
movement in the United States and the consequent shifts in nomenclature:
\"Negroes,\" \"colored people,\" \"Black people,\" \"people of color,\"
\"colored Americans,\" \"Free Africans,\" and \"African Americans.\"
[All the categories were historically contingent social constructions
and political productions that reflected the cultural, economic, and, in
particular, political context in which they were
formulated.]{.underline} Also, the shift from \"Black\" to \"African
American\" reveals their U.S.-centered reality as Black Americans chose
a term that separated them from Blacks around the world, making the
issue linked not simply to race but also to American identity3 and the
particularly violent history of U.S. nation building. Dalits have also
experienced historical evolution seeking terms that reflected their own
sense of identity

It didn't get the attention it deserved. [**The [women who came

[are part of the]{.mark}** [**largest challenge to caste-based sexual
violence in Indian history**]{.mark}. **It's a movement of survivors and
activists who have been marching across India calling out the systemic
failure of the Indian government to protect Dalit women and their
families.**]{.underline} Dalit, which literally means "oppressed,"
refers to those who for hundreds of years they were considered
"untouchables" within the Hindu caste system. They number over 260
million people in India today, with more in Nepal, Sri Lanka and
Bangladesh. Dalit people have traditionally held occupations considered
"ritually impure" --- manual labor like removal of waste, leatherwork,
butchering, and even musicians whose instrument involves an animal's
flesh (like a drum[).The **atrocities committed against Dalit people are
staggering**, even today. On average a [crime against a Dalit person
happens [every 18
minutes](http://www.tehelka.com/2014/10/the-untouchable-bill-dalit-atrocities-casteism/)]{.mark}.
Based just on what's reported, [three women are raped every day.
Thirteen are murdered every week.]{.mark} **A majority of these crimes
are committed with impunity. "We realize this is a battle that we cannot
win by ourselves," said Asha Kowtal, General Secretary of AIDMAM,
explaining the reason for the tour. "The [movement needs]{.mark}**
**[global solidarity from oppressed communities across the world and
allies who will stand with us in this struggle to overhaul institutions
reeking of caste and patriarchy."]{.mark}**]{.underline} Last Thursday,
I was lucky enough to sit in on a conversation with the Seattle South
Asian Solidarity Alliance and
[#DalitWomenFight](http://www.dalitwomenfight.com/) --- the group
organizing the tour. I was shocked by the firsthand accounts we heard of
the atrocities that have been going on in India, including a story about
**a [[woman]{.mark} who [was murdered and tortured with cigarette burns
a]{.mark}ll over her body. [Her death was ruled a suicide]{.mark} --- an
eerie [similarity to what happened to [Sandra
Bland](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sandra-bland-investigation-waller-county_56017d17e4b08820d91a3900)
in Texas]{.mark}. The parallels between stories of Black and Dalit
struggles didn't stop there.]{.underline}** [Manisha Mashaal, Field
Organizer with AIDMAM, told this story at the event: "**In my community,
there was a case of a young woman who was gang raped and murdered in
Haryana on her way to school. This story sent shivers down my spine. I
was so enraged that there was so much silence around the case of a young
Dalit student being brutally murdered in her own
community**]{.underline}**.** I'm a Dalit woman student, and the story
inspired me to take action. We organized family and community members to
the local police station for the results of the autopsy reports. [**We
were treated with so much disrespect at the police station, where
[officers kicked the dead body of the victim]{.mark}. [We filed
complaints]{.mark} to seek justice in courts run by upper caste
perpetrators of violence, with deep solidarity for the victim and her
family. [We were met with so many obstacles as we navigated a]{.mark}**
[**bureaucratic system that is designed to fail
Dalits**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The violence that Dalit women face is not
isolated, there are many of us who are facing the brunt of this caste
apartheid and sexual violence. I refuse to stay silent because there are
no people advocating for Dalit rights. We cannot let the fears of the
police and state institutions silence our struggles[." **The
#DalitWomenFight tour is wrapping up this week in Detroit after visiting
9 cities across the U.S. Stops on the tour are transmedia storytelling
sessions where rooms are flooded with photography, visual art and a
hashtag of the movement, #DalitWomenFight written in lights. [The most
inspiring thing that I learned at the meeting was the]{.mark}**
[**history of co-resistance with Black and Dalit liberation movements**
---]{.mark} and the necessity of that same connection today.
Soundararajan talked about [The Dalit
Panthers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalit_Panthers), a movement
influenced by and connected **to The Black Panther Party in the 1970's.
The Dalit Panthers organized against the varna system of social
classification of Hindus, and set off a renaissance in Dalit literature.
"They had this very deep sense of internationalism where they saw their
liberatory movements linked," she said. "[I think for them Dalit was not
just a religious fight, it was a political and an economic fight. So
they talked a lot about class and their solidarity with other
international struggles]{.mark}**." I asked Soundararajan what her
vision of that solidarity looks like today: "We really need to deeply
understand the root causes of each of our issues and see how our shared
perpetrators, or states, work with each other to keep us individually
oppressed. And when we see the collaborative nature of these empires,
then we can also have a collaborative trans-national strategy. The World
Conference Against Racism in Durban was an amazing example of that,
where you had Black, Palestinian and Dalit peoples on the outside, and
you had our governments corroborating to basically derail the process
because they didn't want to be named and linked on those issues."
"**Internationalism for our liberation is not an option in a
hyper-capitalist world**."]{.underline}
