#### The history of arms sales is intimately intertwined with settler colonialism and capitalist imperialism. As a protectorate of the United States, Israel's growing influence throughout the Middle East is indebted to its status as a semi-colonial state, absolved for its imperialist policies. Arms sales in the form of Foreign Military Sales are integral to Israel's continued dominance over Palestinian populations and the cornerstone of United States' international settler colonial framework. Only a radical break from imperialism through counter-revolutionary movements is capable of disrupting the shared relationship between the United States and Israel.

**[[Israel has been surrounded by controversy
since]{.underline}]{.mark}** the partition of Palestine in
**[[1948]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The controversy has intensified up to
the present time. World opinion and **[[intellectual discourse
can]{.underline}]{.mark}** be taken as a
**[[mirror]{.underline}]{.mark}** of **[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}**
recurrent **[[armed conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}** and permanent state
**[[of]{.underline}]{.mark}** war in **[[the Middle
East]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The war in Lebanon during the summer of
1982 was the most destructive to date; as though a reflection of this
destruction, Israeli designs upon the Middle East have been given their
sharpest condemnation around the world. The televised **[[excesses of
the war]{.underline}]{.mark}** have moreover
**[[occasioned]{.underline}]{.mark}**, for the first time, **[[grave
doubts]{.underline}]{.mark}** within a broad spectrum of the U.S.
public, doubts [**[about Israeli]{.underline}**]{.mark} intentions and
[**[policy and U.S]{.underline}**.]{.mark} governmental
**[[complicity]{.underline}]{.mark}** in that policy. However,
condemnation and doubt do not necessarily lead to broadly communicable
intellectual clarity which can contribute to a popular understanding of
the continuing Middle East crisis. Because clarity on this topic has
frequently been obscured by the terms of discourse.
**[[On]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[one hand, there is metaphysical
discourse]{.underline}]{.mark}** to be contended with, discourse which
privileges Israel and obscures clarity and understanding. This discourse
has two genres: one is eschatological,
**[[whereby]{.underline}]{.mark}** 20th Century **[[Israel is
represented as fulfilling Old Testament prophecy]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
The other is metahistorical, **[[whereby Israel
is]{.underline}]{.mark}** represented as transcending the historicity of
\"normal\" nation-states, a \"unique\" \[60/61\] entity **[[above the
world of historical]{.mark} [nations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Israel is
represented as a product of a unique Holocaust visited upon the Jewish
people, *am sequela*, a people itself \"outside\" of history. On the
other hand, **[[there is a]{.underline}]{.mark}** frankly
[**[technocratic discourse which]{.underline}**]{.mark} differently
privileges Israel, trivializing clarity and understanding. This
discourse **[[is the apologetic genre of the military-industrial complex
which celebrates in]{.underline}]{.mark}** incredibly **[[fetishized
detail]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[military
exploits]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the F-4 Phantom jet, the Uzi
submachine gun, and so forth as the pinnacle of civilization. **[[But
one Book of Joshua is probably one too many.]{.mark}]{.underline}** It
is the intention of this essay to sketch in broad outlines the social
and historical processes of the \"longer term,\" as the French historian
Fernand Braudel has put it, whereby the place of Israel in modern
history will be clarified and can be understood. The historicity of
these processes of longer duration involves terms which contradict those
of metaphysical discourse and which allow shorter term processes (e.g.
the Deir Yassin massacre of 1948, the Tel-Zataar massacre of 1976, the
Shatila and Sabra massacres of 1982) to be analysed fully without the
discussion degenerating into the fetishized discourse of technocracy.
Let us now establish some of those terms. Capitalism is widely
understood as having developed through several stages \-- three, to be
precise: first, merchant capitalism, then competitive or industrial
capitalism, and finally, finance capitalism. The historical and
processual nature of the development of capitalism must be stressed,
with all the transitions, all the intermediate forms, which constitute
such a process. The first and last of these stages are the occasions of
the founding of modern empires. Merchant capitalism gave rise, most
importantly, to settler colonies in South Africa and the Americas: the
Cape Colony, the United States, the Viceroyalty of the Rio de la Plata,
etc. The imperialism of finance capitalism repartitioned the colonial
world among the capitalist \"great powers\" toward the close of the
nineteenth century. For example, the U.S. appropriated the Spanish
colonies of Cuba and Puerto Rico. Moreover, imperialism partitioned the
hitherto uncolonized remainder of the globe into imperialist
possessions. For instance, the Congo was assigned to King Leopold of
Belgium at the 1884 Berlin Conference.\[61/62\] The scientific
conception of imperialism emerged during the First World War, and has
been associated with the names of John Hobson and V. I. Lenin. In terms
of historical periods, imperialism is the predominant form of
geographical expansion of late nineteenth and twentieth century
capitalism, and must be distinguished from colonialism. Colonialism was
the predominant form of global expansion of seventeenth and eighteenth
century merchant capitalism. This was an early stage in the development
of capitalism, characterized by mercantile rather than entrepreneurial
domination over enterprise. Furthermore, the small scale of production
corresponded to a weak and variable control over labor, necessitating
non-wage forms of labor-force control such as settler colonialism,
indenture, and slavery. Hence metropolitans, the \"settlers,\"
characteristically emigrated to the colonies to extract (or grow) and to
ship \"staple products\" back to the metropole under conditions of trade
favorable to mercantile interests. Examples of staples from North
America included furs, lumber, and later wheat from the northernmost
colonies and tobacco, sugar, indigo, and rice, and later cotton from the
southern colonies. Two crucial conditions of colonialism were plentiful,
cheap *land* (the \"colony\" itself, with its indigenous peoples either
evacuated, exterminated, or enslaved) and agricultural or extractive
*labor power* (the \"settlers,\" complemented by their indentured
servants and enslaved \"natives\" as well as imported slaves). As a
final characteristic, colonialism was the globally expansive force of
contending \"mother countries\" which warred perennially. Thus wars were
waged not only against the indigenous peoples during settlement, but
between one metropole and its colonies and another and its colonies as
well. Imperialism, by contrast, is widely understood to be the final
stage in the development of capitalism. It is a stage characterized by
financial institutions\' domination of industrial enterprise. It is
characterized by a substantial capital flow from the metropole to the
imperialist possession in search of a higher rate of profit than that
available at home, for instance today\'s \"runaway shops.\" Imperialism
is characterized by military adventures on the part of the metropolitan
nations, the capitalist great powers. This adventurism acts itself out
in the subjugation and continued domination of the imperialist
possessions,\" dirty little wars\" such as the United States has just
launched against Grenada. It also acts itself out in the metropole as
the \"world wars\" between the great powers. It is frequently argued
that [**[the origin and]{.underline}**]{.mark} subsequent
**[[development]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[62/63\] **[[of Israel can be
understood in terms of]{.underline}]{.mark}** the scientific conception
of **[[imperialism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. On the one hand
**[[Zionist]{.mark} [apologists hold that Palestine was an imperialist
possession of Great Britain, and]{.mark}]{.underline}** that
**[[Jewish]{.mark} [resistance]{.mark}]{.underline}** to British
domination eventually **[[took the form of a \"war of national
liberation\"]{.underline}]{.mark}** whereby Palestine was partitioned
and Israel emerged. This understanding links Israel with the preeminent
global political process of the last half of this century, the
anti-imperialist struggle of \"Third World\" nations. **[[On the other
hand]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the question is being raised in progressive
political circles whether **[[Israel has]{.mark}
[become]{.mark}]{.underline}** in its own right a developed capitalist
country and even **[[an imperialist power]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This
inquiry finds evidence in the obvious superiority of Israel\'s military
technology and performance over that of its Arab neighbors and in its
widely proclaimed aspirations to supplant the West as the political
power in the Middle East. **[[This position finds]{.underline}]{.mark}**
further **[[evidence]{.mark} [in Israel\'s *de facto* and *de jure*
seizure of Syrian and Lebanese territory, and]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
**[[its]{.underline}]{.mark}** \"classic **[[colonialist\"
administration of the West Bank, Golan Heights, Gaza Strip,
and]{.underline}]{.mark}** now **[[southern
Lebanon]{.underline}]{.mark}**. We will suggest that **[[neither of
these positions can be sustained]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Under the
League of Nations Mandate, *Palestine* was indeed a British imperialist
possession. Yet **[[the emergence of]{.mark} [*Israel*
cannot]{.mark}]{.underline}** thereby **[[be understood as
anti-imperialist]{.underline}]{.mark}**, no more than the \"Rhodesia\"
of Ian Smith and his short-lived \"Unilateral Declaration of
Independence.\" Zionist apologists do indeed fantasize about a Greater
Israel stretching from the Suez Canal to the Fertile Crescent. Yet
Israel, the *de facto* protectorate of the United States, cannot be
understood as any sort of imperialist power, no more than the British
protectorate, Portugal under Salazar, with its own possessions in
Mozambique, Angola, and elsewhere. But these two understandings, Israel
as self-emancipated former imperialist possession and Israel as
self-standing imperialist power, do not exhaust the scientific
conception of imperialism. Both of these are limited understandings
which demand in their one-sidedness a more scientific comprehension.
Such a comprehension is available. In Chapter 6 of his book entitled
*Imperialism,* Lenin observes that
**[[imperialism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, like other matters of nature and
social life, **[[is characterized by a series of \"transitional
forms]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\" Between the autarky of the imperialist
power on the one hand and the subjugated imperialist possession on the
other are a number of what he calls **[[\"semi-colonial
states,\"]{.underline}]{.mark}** entities **[[which
are]{.underline}]{.mark}** nominally [**[sovereign but militarily,
economically, and politically dependent upon a genuine imperialist
power]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Examples? Lenin mentions Portugal and
Argentina, both clients of Great Britain. For instance, in our
contemporary world an imperialist power such as West Germany (FGR) can
be juxtaposed to imperialist possessions (or, following Kwame Nkrumah,
what we should more properly speak of as \"neo-colonial concessions\")
such as Barbados, Honduras or Guatemala. Between these extremes lie
today\'s \"semi-colonies.\" It is perhaps instructive to inquire why
these are \"transitional\" forms. Transitional from what to what?
Logically, or perhaps better, typologically, these are intermediate
between the dependent and the independent, political entities
characterized by formal political independence but actual dependency.
Historically, these are transitional forms in the global development of
capitalism. These **[[\"semi-colonial states\" are residuals of merchant
capital\'s settler colonialism in the era of finance
capitalism.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Their own economic development has
been impeded because of geographical location, limited population, etc.
Hence on the one hand they have not grown into developed capitalist
countries or imperialist powers. On the other hand, they retain vestiges
of their own colonial heritage and metropolitan culture and have not
been reduced to imperialist possessions, nor, what is more frequent
today, to neo-colonial concessions such as Jamaica, Kenya and Zaire.
Straightforward examples today of such \"transitional forms\" are South
Africa and Brazil. It will become clear that Israel is such a
\"transitional form\" as well. The remainder of this essay will develop
two themes. **[[First]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the League of Nations
Mandate in Palestine was the product of twentieth century British
imperialism, just as Lebanon was the product of French imperialism. But
**[[Israel]{.underline}]{.mark}** was quite another case. It **[[is the
product]{.underline}]{.mark}** \-- a profoundly anachronistic product
\-- **[[of European settler colonialism]{.underline}]{.mark}** deriving
from merchant capitalism. Present space considerations permit only a
severely abbreviated account of the historical documentation which this
theme requires. **[[Second, Israel has]{.underline}]{.mark}** always
been a dependency of the imperialist powers and currently has **[[become
*de facto* a protectorate of the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates. Jointly, these two themes are
sufficient to conclude that Israel is precisely one of the
\"transitional forms\" of imperialism in both the typological and the
historical sense. The end of the French and Indian War was affirmed by
the Treaty of Paris in 1763. It had two momentous al\[64/65\]though
distant consequences for the future of Palestine. The defeat of France
and its war debt contributed to the outbreak of the French Revolution
and Napoleon\'s invasion of Egypt. The British victory relieved the
American colonists of the \'French menace\', which allowed the colonists
to raise a war of national liberation within a few years. The
termination of the First British Empire focussed British imperial
attention toward the Orient, toward India. Thus the First British Empire
gave way almost immediately to the Second British Empire; both were
colonial forms deriving from early-modern merchant capitalism, far
antedating the imperialism of the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries. Thereby the middle of the British Empire, \"where the
extremes meet,\" came to be raised to the level of world-historical
significance that the Middle East retains today, long surviving even the
Empire. The Revolution threatened the British Empire throughout - at its
middle and at both ends. In the British Isles, the war with
Revolutionary France generated revolutionary unrest in the Corresponding
Societies, modelled on the French Jacobin Clubs, as well as naval
mutinies at Spithead in April and on the Nore in May of 1797. By 1795,
the middle of Britain\'s Indian route had been reinforced when the Cape
of Good Hope was captured from the Dutch. Finally, Napoleon Bonaparte\'s
Egyptian expedition in 1798 was incorrectly but widely taken by the
English to be a thrust at India. In countering Bonaparte, Malta was
taken by British forces in 1800 while Bonaparte\'s Egyptian campaign
failed. Interestingly enough, Bonaparte proposed a canal at Suez in his
invasion plans. In the end, however, the Second British Empire remained
secure, its great enemy exiled on St. Helena, a station in the middle of
the trade route to India. Established as early as 1651, St. Helena had
been strategically downgraded by the nineteenth century in favor of the
Cape Colony. Meanwhile the revolutionary ferment had changed the
position of Jews in France. While there had been such thinkers of the
Enlightenment as Gotthold Ephraim Lessing who had questioned the denial
of full rights and citizenship to Jews, their \'emancipation\' awaited
the French Revolution and its Constituent Assembly, which decreed on
September 28, 1791 that Jews should enjoy all civic rights. This
\"assimilation\" of the Jews raised problems on its own. Assimilation
implies that a nationalist alternative is not available for the people
themselves. G.W.F. Hegel had already declared Palestine \-- the \"Holy
Land\" \-- to be a \"graveyard\" in his *Lectures on the Philosophy of
History* of the \[65/66\] 1820\'s. Thus it is understandable that the
young Moses Hess evidenced none of his later Zionism when he published
his Hegelian *Holy History of Mankind* in 1837. While assimilation was
progressing in Western Europe and even more in North America, historical
forces were about to usher in a new stage of capitalism which would
change the world and Judaism. The Suez Canal was completed in 1869 at
the height of the Second Empire of Louis Bonaparte, nephew of Napoleon
I. With Gibraltar, Malta, and the Aden Protectorate, Britain controlled
the major sea approaches to the Canal. Yet the fear of new French
expansionism made the British uneasy; Sedan and the sack of Paris after
the Commune of 1871 relieved these fears. When Prime Minister Benjamin
Disraeli\'s government purchased the Egyptian Khedive\'s shares of the
Suez Canal in 1875, Gladstone\'s only observation was that the canal
might prove fiscally unsound. Quite the contrary, of course, a vast
volume of shipping came to be diverted from the Cape route through the
Mediterranean and Red Sea route. Thus the Cape could be strategically
downgraded in favor of the Suez Canal. Just as St. Helena was retained
as an active coaling station long after its strategic primacy was lost,
so the Cape was retained to secure a secondary route to India. By the
late 1870\'s, George Eliot proposed in her \"Essays\" that the Jewish
people were \"not, before the dispersion, unique in essential
qualities,\" that is, they could constitute a nation-state in the modern
sense. She pondered whether there were not \"in the political relations
of the world, the conditions present or approaching for the restoration
of a Jewish State planted on the old ground\...\" The emergence of such
ideas in late nineteenth century British thought, only slightly
influenced by Jewish nationalists like Emmanuel Deutsch, Moses Hess, and
Hirsch Kalischer, can be straightforwardly explained in terms of the
exigences of empire and especially those of the Suez Canal. Imperial
control of populous Egypt has always proved as difficult from within as
the control of its neighbors without. Palestine was the obvious
alternative for the strategic control of the Suez Canal. And this
provides the explanation of these British ruling-class apologetics. As
early as his hackneyed 1847 novel, *Tancred,* Benjamin Disraeli had
recognized of the Second British Empire that *les extremes se touchent*,
and the middle of the Empire was Palestine. There are two curious
aspects to his observations. First, only the middle of the Empire is
fixed and the end-points are indifferent: Disraeli\'s character
\[66/67\] proposes that Queen Victoria shift the capital from London to
Delhi! Second, Disraeli\'s character proposes that Palestine be
conquered, on behalf of Britain, by the *Maronites.* This proposal
reflected the impossibility of the Jewish colonization of Palestine at
mid-century due to the small number of Jews in England. The subtitle of
Disraeli\'s novel is telling: \"The New Crusade\" would employ the ever
ready Maronite allies of the imperialists. By the close of the century,
however, Disraeli\'s Tory heirs would find a few Jewish colonists to
establish instead \"The New Colony.\" The difficulty of convivial
interaction let alone assimilation of Ashkenazim and Palestinians made
Jewish colonization desirable for the British as \"a rampart of Europe
against Asia,\" as the Zionist Theodore Herzl put it in his programmatic
*Der Judenstaat* of 1896. But the opportunity for Jewish colonization of
Palestine awaited World War I, since Lord Allenby and his British troops
would capture Jerusalem on Christmas Day, 1917. The British Foreign
Secretary, Arthur Balfour, had already prepared the letter expressing
British support for \"the establishment in Palestine of a national home
for the Jewish people\... \", which became known as the Balfour
Declaration. The League of Nations formalized the British Mandate in
1922. Then the \"Red Scare\" in the United States curtailed Eastern
European Jewish immigration during the mid-Twenties while Jozef
Pilsudski\'s proto-fascism maintained some pressure on the numerous
Polish Jews to emigrate. But colonization itself required the mature
fascism of Nazi Germany and another World War to provide the flood of
Zionist and other Jewish settlers to expel the Palestinians and to
occupy Palestine in their place. The defeat of the Central Powers, the
Treaty of Versailles and the mandates terminated German overseas
expansion after 1919. But nothing in the Treaty of Versailles or the
League of Nations terminated the continuing development of German
capitalism, its attendant declining rate of profit and its consequent
imperialist expansionism. After the passing of the social democratic
interlude of Weimar, Adolf Hitler showed little if any interest in the
former German colonies in Africa. Instead, the focus of Nazi imperialist
designs was on the Slavic regions and especially the Ukraine. Indeed,
Hitler was abetted in these designs by the British imperialists on both
sides of the Atlantic Ocean. It was an incredibly smug *Montreal Star,*
for instance, which editorialized on September 21, 1938, after Munich,
that Hitler \"will never attack either France or Britain,\" because he
was too \"wise\" \[67/68\] for that; instead, he would soon \"seek the
opportunity to show the Russians, as he has boasted, how to exploit the
wheatfields of the Ukraine.\" The Nazi programme for Eastern Europe
differed little from that which obtained in the actual German colonies
there and had a distinct cultural continuity with the earlier militarism
of the feudal Teutonic Order. The \"Ostraum\" was to constitute the
\"Greater Germany\" whose colonists would have no convivial interaction
with the subjugated Slavs. While adjudged \"racially inferior\" by the
Nazis, the Slavs were at least \"racially pure.\" All \"racially
impure\" peoples, for instance Jews and Gypsies, were to be
exterminated. This settler colonial and racist programme of the Nazis
was honored in the breach in several important respects. One was the
Nazi promotion of the proto-fascist General Andrei Vlasov\'s \"Russian
Liberation Army\" (ROA) which fantasized about the existence of
anti-Bolshevik hostility among the Soviet populace. Another was the Nazi
use of Jewish labor in the war effort. As already noted, the Nazi labor
programme for Eastern Europe postulated a \"hierarchy of races.\" The
Nazi doctrine considered the Germans to be superior humans, the Slavs to
be inferior humans, and the Jews, Gypsies, etc. to be subhuman. But the
war effort placed demands upon the Nazi regime that obliged it to
utilize otherwise \"undesirables.\" The resolution of this dilemma was,
as the historian Jurgen Kuczynski has pointed out, to lower the
\"standard of living\" of the Jews in the labor force to the point where
they would soon die out. Hitler expected that the war would be short;
hence the racial policies of extermination and the settler colonial
policies of land acquisition in the East would coincide in the collapse
of the Soviet Union at the hands of the Third Reich. The Jews in the
Slavic regions were thus subjugated under the colonial policy of the
most vicious of modern capitalist regimes, that of Nazi Germany. Prior
to the Holocaust, the Jews had experienced other capitalist regimes
which systematically took \"exception\" to the rule of law and are
thereby called *exceptional regimes.* Such exceptional regimes included
Marshal Pilsudski\'s Poland, Admiral Horthy\'s Hungary, and Rumania.
These experiences with the \"levity of law\" seem to have been
sufficient to inculcate the terrorist mentality in the likes of Vladimir
Jabotinsky and Menachim Begin; consider how much more profoundly the
actual experience of the Nazi regime would contribute to what the famous
Jewish philosopher Walter Benjamin called \"Jewish fascism.\" This was
particularly to be expected \[68/69\] in light of the opposition in
Europe between progressive politics and Zionism. Thus Zionist survivors
of the Holocaust were prepared to acquiesce if not actively contribute
to the development of an \"exceptional\" regime in Palestine. The
interview of Golda Meir in the *Sunday Times* of London on June 15, 1969
was symptomatic of the consequences for Zionist perceptions of the
Holocaust. Of the Palestinians, she said, \"they did not exist.\"
**[[The]{.underline}]{.mark}** Nazi **[[denial of the
\"existence\"]{.mark} [of a subjugated people is thus reproduced in that
same people\'s denial of the \"existence\" of another subjugated
people.]{.mark} [An \"exceptional\" regime was *necessary* for the
expropriation of Palestinian lands]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The
expropriation of Arab peasant land **[[and then its \"acquisition\"
by]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[Zionists was]{.underline}]{.mark}**
substantially **[[realized within a decade]{.underline}]{.mark}** of
partition. Thus one crucial condition of settler colonialism, cheap
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** plentiful land, was being fulfilled.
Moreover, an \"exceptional\" regime **[[was more than]{.mark}
[*adequate* for the Ashkenazim immigrants who
flooded]{.mark}]{.underline}** into **[[Palestine]{.underline}]{.mark}**
just after World War II. These immigrants were more or less **[[prepared
to act as settler colonists]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Palestine, more or
less indifferent to their merchant capitalist role. Thus another crucial
condition of settler colonialism, displaced metropolitans, was being
fulfilled. And the Sephardim all around the Arab world were manipulated
by the Zionists in tacit league with Arab reaction \-- the same
monarchies which today are labelled \"moderate Arab regimes\" \-- to
\"flesh out,\" as it were, the ranks of the immigrants. Lloyd George had
partitioned Ireland in December, 1921. With the end of World War II and
the exhaustion of Great Britain, the \"jewel\" of the Second British
Empire was fast slipping away. The partition of the subcontinent of
India was very hurriedly completed by Viceroy Mountbatten on August 15,
1947. Thus the notion of \"partition\" of colonies was not unprecedented
in British ruling class circles. And such a policy was clearly
compatible with the doctrine of *divide et impera.* With the loss of
India, the Oriental end-point of the Second British Empire was
immediately reestablished on the Persian Gulf. Now the staple product
was *petroleum.* As President Dwight D. Eisenhower characterized the
situation in his address to the U.S. Congress on January 5, 1957, the
Gulf region (and Arabia) \"normally supplies the petroleum needs of many
nations of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Now the nations of Europe are
peculiarly dependent upon this supply and this dependency relates to
transportation as well as production.\" Thus the new end-point of empire
is the Gulf. And notice Eisenhower\'s reference to \"transportation.\"
The middle is still the \[69/70\] Suez Canal. Were it lost, Eisenhower
goes on in the most apocalyptic of terms, \"Western Europe would be
endangered just as though there had been no Marshall Plan, no North
Atlantic Treaty Organization. The free nations of Asia and Africa, too,
would be placed in serious jeopardy.\" **[[Thus]{.underline}]{.mark}**
when Gamal Abdul Nasser had nationalized the Suez Canal in July 1956,
terminating what he called \"a state within a state\" and providing for
the financing of the High Dam at Aswan, **[[the
British]{.underline}]{.mark}** (and their French allies) **[[attempted
to reestablish hegemony through]{.underline}]{.mark}** their colonial
creature, **[[the Zionist settler state. The
Israelis]{.underline}]{.mark}** pretended that they were threatened with
being \"swamped from three sides with a new wave of Fedayeen violence.\"
The Syrian and the Jordanian \"sides,\" however, were disingenuously
discounted by the Israelis who **[[invaded]{.underline}]{.mark}** only
**[[Egypt]{.underline}]{.mark}** on October 29, 1956. **[[Given this
pretext, the British and French]{.underline}]{.mark}** themselves
**[[attacked]{.mark} [Egypt]{.mark}]{.underline}** for the avowed
purposes of **[[protecting their vital interests in the
Canal]{.underline}]{.mark}** on the one hand
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}**, on the other, **[[preventing
an]{.underline}]{.mark}** armed **[[clash between the Zionist regime and
Egypt!]{.underline}]{.mark}** Even Zionist historians such as Salomon
Grayzel admit that the Israelis \"probably knew beforehand that France
and England intended to act.\" As we know now, however, by 1956 the
middle of the colonialist Second British Empire had been irretrievably
lost. Dominion was lost in Cyprus in 1961, in Malta in 1964, and in
Yemen a day before schedule in November 1967. Thus the Second British
Empire ended by the late sixties, if not before. But some of the
creatures of that almost two centuries of colonialism lived on. For
instance, the Mandate in Palestine, the product of twentieth-century
imperialism, has been terminated and imperialism seems to be on the
retreat around the globe. Meanwhile **[[Israel]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
the product of the much earlier merchant colonialism, **[[survives as a
\"transitional form\"]{.underline}]{.mark}** within the system of
imperialism. It even acts on behalf of that imperialism,
**[[destabilizing]{.underline}]{.mark}** and Balkanizing **[[the Middle
East]{.underline}]{.mark}** and reacting against national liberation
movements around the world. So much for the genesis of Israel as a
belated colony of merchant capitalism. This raises the other theme of
this essay. What can be said about its contemporary dependency status ?
It is important initially to distinguish between the concepts of
\[70/71\] \"dependence\" and \"interdependence,\" especially in a
discussion of the modern interdependent world. Both concepts involve an
interrelationship between several entities, in this case, political
entities. There are two dimensions of this interrelationship: salience
and uniqueness. Where several entities find each other to be
particularly important to their existence or welfare (that is mutually
\'salient\'), they are interdependent. In this sense it can be said that
the modern world is interdependent; developed capitalist countries are
interdependent. Where one entity finds another entity to be salient, and
where there are no alternatives to the second entity (that is, it is
\'unique\'), then the first entity is dependent upon the second. Recall
Eisenhower\'s reference to the petroleum needs of Europe and that these
nations are \"peculiarly dependent\" upon the petroleum supply from the
Gulf region. In the following, we will show that **[[Israel is]{.mark}
[categorically dependent upon the U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates in just these terms of salience and
uniqueness. **[[But the relationship]{.underline}]{.mark}** between
imperialist power and its possession, too, **[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}**
one of domination and dependency, **[[one of inherently unequal
relations]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Much has been made of this in the
theory of \"Unequal Exchange\" promoted by Arghiri Emmanuel during the
late sixties. Whatever the merits of this theory, quite another aspect
of imperial inequality should be noted in the present context: the
relationship between imperial power and its possession invariably
implicates a thoroughgoing racism. **[[Unequal relations between
political entities]{.underline}]{.mark}** under the regime of
imperialism **[[corresponds to unequal relations
between]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[ethnic
groups]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the metropole and those which populate
the possession. The relationship between merchant capital \"mother
country\" and its colonies, by contrast, never presented its inequality
in racist guise insofar as metropolitans and settlers were concerned.
This **[[privileging of the settler becomes part of
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** colonial heritage and **[[culture, and is
reflected]{.mark} [throughout the relationship between the
\"transitional forms\" and their imperialist
protectors.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The relation of metropolitans today
\--\"on vacation\" in the semi-colony, say \-- toward \"natives\" may be
as racist as that of the settlers, while that is not the case between
metropolitans and settlers. The settler colonists are, after all,
derived from the same ethnic groups as the metropolitans; many of the
colonists hold metropolitan passports and so forth. They are simply
metropolitans \"overseas,\" and are perceived as such both by themselves
and by others.\[71/72\] Where the settlers arrived at the colony as a
cohort, such as the Protestants at Ulster, this is straightforward.
Circumstances become somewhat more complex where they arrive in several
cohorts or waves, such as Boers and \"Uitlanders\" (English) in the Cape
Colony. Then a \"vertical mosaic\" emerges, where the racial distinction
between settlers and indigenous peoples still predominates, as does the
unity of the settler groups with their metropole. This analysis bears
directly on the Zionist colonization. Until the close of the l9th
Century, the minuscule Jewish population in Palestine was economically
utterly dependent: it existed only through the charity of Diaspora Jews,
called the Halukkah, estimated to have amounted to £ 100,000 Sterling
during the 1880\'s. Then the first aliyah entered Palestine; its settler
colonies, too, were utterly dependent \-- they existed only through the
largesse of Baron Edmond de Rothschild. Much has been written \-- and
much of that writing has been Zionist \-- criticizing the dependency of
these late nineteenth and early twentieth century experiments in Jewish
colonialism. It must be one of the great ironies of modern history \--
the utter dependency of present-day Zionist Israel upon the Halukkah of
\"Uncle Sam.\" During the Mandate, the Jewish population became
dependent upon the British authorities, especially for defense against
the increasingly aggrieved and hostile Palestinian people. Meanwhile the
mass aliyah from Western Europe and North America which had been
predicted by the Zionists never occurred. Instead Diaspora Jews remained
in the metropolitan countries and continued to support the Jewish Agency
in Palestine, and generously so. Economic dependency might have been
expected to continue for some time after partition. Indeed, Alex Rubner
has estimated the sum of Israel\'s Gross National Product for its first
decade to have been just under ten billion dollars, while the sum of
\"charitable and political aid\" for the decade was about one- quarter
as large. As Asad Abdul-Rahman and others have documented, a
considerable amount of this vast flow of funds to the Zionists took the
form of gifts from Diaspora Jews or loans. Of course **[[there
was]{.underline}]{.mark}** some **[[U.S. aid from the
beginning]{.mark}.]{.underline}** President Harry [**[Truman announced
the first]{.underline}**]{.mark} U.S. **[[loan]{.underline}]{.mark}** to
Israel **[[in]{.underline}]{.mark}** November
**[[1948]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a few months after partition.
**[[By]{.underline}]{.mark}** the time of the
**[[1956]{.underline}]{.mark}** war, **[[the U.S. had given Israel
an]{.underline}]{.mark}** estimated **[[half-billion
dollars]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the form of officially announced loans
and grants. Another important portion consisted of West Germany\'s
reparations to Israel in addition to \[72/73\] its restitutions to the
survivors of the Holocaust. The government of the FGR began negotiations
in March 1952 with Israel and representatives of Diaspora Jewish
organizations regarding reparation payments. An agreement was concluded
in September of that year and was ratified in March 1953. Since that
time the FGR has contributed the equivalent of many billions of dollars
to Israel. Little wonder that a UNESCO report published in 1958
conservatively estimated that **[[between 1953 and 1957,
Israel]{.underline}]{.mark}** had **[[received more economic aid per
capita than any other country]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the world; it
received almost twice as much as the next-ranked country.
**[[After]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[1956]{.underline}]{.mark}** war
**[[much of this]{.underline}]{.mark}** flow **[[began to take the form
of direct military aid]{.underline}]{.mark}** and was increasingly
**[[augmented by]{.underline}]{.mark}** official **[[U.S. \"foreign
aid.\" By 1962 the Zionist lobby]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the U.S. had
**[[spent]{.underline}]{.mark}** over **[[five
million]{.underline}]{.mark}** dollars to facilitate this change; it was
completed at about the time of the war of June 1967.
**[[In]{.underline}]{.mark}** September **[[1962, the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
announced that **[[it was supplying]{.mark} [Hawk]{.mark}]{.underline}**
surface-to-air **[[missiles to Israel]{.underline}]{.mark}**. During the
following years, the U.S. also began supplying Israel with **[[Patton
tanks]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Finally, in May 1966, the United States
announced it would supply Israel with **[[A-4 Skyhawk
fighter-bombers]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The U.S. supply of weapons
systems to Israel thus progressed from defensive to offensive during
this period. Moreover, the U.S. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) to Israel
began to grow exponentially after the June l967 war. Hearings during
1977 by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee indicated that FMS
deliveries to Israel were \$14 million in FY 1967, over \$28 million in
1968, over \$72 million the next year, \$126 million in l970, and \$315
million in l971. During 1972 and 1973 the FMS deliveries to Israel were
*only* about \$190 million per annum. Then the FMS deliveries jumped
again in FY 1974; they amounted to almost a billion dollars of arms.
Indeed, this military aid can be viewed as a major precipitant of the
October 1973 war. According to a 1983 U.S. General Accounting Office
(GAO) draft report on assistance to Israel, **[[the U.S. has
provided]{.underline}]{.mark}** Israel with **[[a total of \$15.5
billion in FMS loans between 1950 and 1983]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As
already noted, the greatest part of that total was incurred since 1967,
during last half of Israel\'s existence. The very magnitude of this aid
is strong evidence for Israel\'s *military* dependence on the United
States; its increase suggests the growth of this dependence. **[[The
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[provides credit to Israel for military
purchases]{.underline}]{.mark}**, usually **[[in the form of
loans.]{.underline}]{.mark}** This is characteristic of U.S. arms trade
around the world. But for Israel, much of the principal of the loans
\[73/74\] has been **[[immediately forgiven]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
making the \"loan\" into a grant. Nonetheless, the Israeli debt service
for the remaining principal of the total FMS loans amounted to \$810
million in 1982. The problem of servicing such a debt in an economy as
fragile as that of Israel can scarcely be overstated. Moreover, the
remaining principal has been unpaid through grace periods of ten years.
Those grace periods are ending for the earlier FMS loans; the principal
is coming due. And those circumstances focus our attention on the second
major component of official U.S. assistance to Israel, that channelled
through the Economic Support Fund (ESF) program, administered by the
Agency for International Development (AID). According to the GAO draft
report, **[[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[has
provided]{.underline}]{.mark}** Israel with **[[\$6.6 billion in]{.mark}
[ESF assistance between]{.mark}]{.underline}** FY **[[1972
and]{.underline}]{.mark}** FY **[[1983]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
greatest portion of this assistance (and since FY 1981, all the annual
amounts) has taken the form of outright grants **[[and is utilized
to]{.mark} [cover the debt service on the FMS
loans]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This is unlike U.S. foreign aid elsewhere
in the world, which is linked to other countries\' specific economic
development projects. The GAO report further anticipates that **[[the
gap between ESF grants and]{.underline}]{.mark}** the debt service and
**[[FMS loan repayments will continue to increase,
reaching]{.underline}]{.mark}** almost **[[a billion dollars difference
by]{.underline}]{.mark}** FY **[[1993]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as more
and more of the grace periods end. Whether the U.S. government forgives
an even greater part of the loans, thereby adding to budgetary deficits
at home, or extends the grace periods for the principal, thereby merely
postponing the day of fiscal reckoning, is a choice to be made by U.S.
elected and appointed officials, with \-- or more likely without \--
full public discussion. In any case, the magnitude of this ESF
assistance provides good evidence for Israel\'s *economic* dependence on
the United States. On the one hand, such dependence does not entail that
Israel is an imperialist possession. It will be recalled that capital is
exported from the metropole to the imperialist possession in search of
higher rates of profit than that available at home. Israel is not an
imperialist possession, if for no other reason than the moribund state
of its economy. Capital is not exported there because of higher rates of
profit; indeed some of the foreign investment in Israel, for instance
from U.S. pension plans, is made in contravention of \"prudent
investor\" clauses of trust funds. On the other hand, there is no
indication that **[[this dependence will]{.underline}]{.mark}** do
anything but **[[increase in the]{.underline}]{.mark}** foreseeable
**[[future]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And this discussion hasn\'t even
commented on the enormous import surpluses of the Israeli economy,
another measure of economic depend\[74/75\]ence. These surpluses have
never been less than \$238 million per annum since 1950, and have tended
to increase over the years. Hence, Israel is both militarily and
economically dependent upon the United States. The economist Thomas
Stauffer has expressed it well in the very title to his 1983
publication: \"U.S. Aid to Israel \[is\] the Vital Link.\" If, in
addition, \"Arik\" Sharon had to get the green light from U.S. Secretary
of State Alexander Haig to attack Lebanon in 1982, as Sharon avers, then
even Israel\'s loudly and widely proclaimed political independence from
the United States can be questioned. Nominal political independence has
always provided a convenient cloak to mask true dependency. Let us
conclude by briefly summarizing our argument and noting some
implications. In terms of the scientific conception of imperialism,
Israel is not the product of anti-imperialist struggle, neither is it an
imperialist power, nor possession. It is instead a creature of the
earlier settler colonialism of merchant capitalism, existing as a
\"transitional form\" within the modern system of imperialism. Its
status is indeed one of military, economic, and perhaps even political
dependency upon the United States, but this is the dependency of a
\"semi- colonial state.\" [**[Such a conclusion has several
implications]{.underline}**,]{.mark} all of which highlight the
importance for Israelis of breaking this dependency cycle. **[[First,
Israelis]{.underline}]{.mark}** themselves **[[must move toward full
recognition of]{.underline}]{.mark}** the sole legitimate representative
of the **[[Palestinians]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the PLO, and further,
begin the movement to withdraw to the pre-1967 borders of Israel. This
is necessary if Israel is ever to break its military dependency upon the
United States. While **[[such political motion]{.underline}]{.mark}**
within Israel is not absolutely inconceivable, it **[[will surely
require a radical turn from the present political
leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}** as well as from what currently passes
for the \"loyal opposition.\" Next, **[[economic]{.mark}
[independence]{.mark}]{.underline}** of Israel [**[can only be
established through a profound rupture with]{.underline}**]{.mark} the
system of **[[imperialism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This follows from the
linkage between Israel\'s militarism, aided and abetted by imperialism,
and its resulting and categorical economic dependency. Such a break by
the world\'s foremost debtor nation may be traumatic. The resulting
decline in standards of living may be quite severe in the short term.
Finally, this analysis suggests that **[[reconciling ethnic]{.mark}
[antagonisms within Israel can only proceed through the elimination of
all vestiges of racism.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Setting aside \[75/76\]
the issue of \"non-Jews\" for just an instant, the racism which
permeates the relationship between European and Arab would still prevent
nation-building. This should not be taken as the counsel of despair.
**[[A thoroughgoing break with militarism and imperialism will unleash
popular forces within Israeli society]{.underline}]{.mark}** itself.
**[[Such]{.underline}]{.mark}** popular [**[forces must
undertake]{.underline}**]{.mark} these and [**[even greater
transformations]{.underline}**.]{.mark} No, it is the policies of the
status quo that proven to be the counsel of despair.\[76/\]

**Narratives of Israel's innocence are rooted in settler complacency and
shaped by the Pro-Israel lobby to silence criticism -- now is critical
to challenge militarism.**

I have not been alone. Until very recently, the entire [**[Congress has
remained]{.mark}**]{.underline} mostly [**[silent on the human rights
nightmare]{.mark}**]{.underline} that has unfolded in the occupied
territories[.]{.underline} Our elected representatives, who operate in a
political environment where **[[Israel\'s political lobby [holds

consistently minimized and deflected criticism of the State of Israel,
even as it has grown more emboldened in its occupation of Palestinian
territory and adopted some practices reminiscent of apartheid in South
Africa and Jim Crow segregation in the United States. Many civil rights
activists and organizations have remained silent as
well**[,]{.underline}** not because they lack concern or sympathy for
the Palestinian people, but because they fear loss of funding from
foundations, and false charges of anti-Semitism. They worry, as I once
did, that their important social justice work will be compromised or
discredited by smear campaigns. Similarly, many [[s**tudents are fearful
of expressing support for Palestinian**]{.mark}]{.underline} rights
[**[because of the McCarthyite tactics of secret

which blacklists those who publicly dare to support boycotts against
Israel, jeopardizing their employment prospects and future careers.
Reading King's
[speech](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/king-papers/documents/beyond-vietnam)
at Riverside more than 50 years later, I am left with little doubt that
his teachings and message require us to speak out passionately against
the human rights crisis in Israel-Palestine, despite the risks and
despite the complexity of the issues. King argued, when speaking of
Vietnam, that even "when the issues at hand seem as perplexing as they
often do in the case of this dreadful conflict," we must not be
mesmerized by uncertainty. "We must speak with all the humility that is
appropriate to our limited vision, but we must speak." And so, if we are
to honor King's message and not merely the man, we must condemn Israel's
actions: **[[unrelenting violations of international law, continued
occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza, home
demolitions]{.mark}]{.underline}** and **[[land
confiscations]{.mark}.]{.underline}** We must cry out at the treatment
of Palestinians at checkpoints, the **[[routine
searches]{.underline}]{.mark}** of their homes and **[[restrictions on
their movements]{.mark},]{.underline}** and the severely **[[limited
access to]{.underline}]{.mark}** decent
**[[housing]{.mark},]{.underline}** schools, food, hospitals **[[and

tolerate Israel's refusal]{.mark}]{.underline}** even **[[to discuss the
right of Palestinian refugees]{.underline}]{.mark}** to return to their
homes, as prescribed by United Nations resolutions, and we ought to

can muster, **[[speak out against the system of legal
discrimination]{.mark}]{.underline}** that exists inside
Israel**[,]{.underline}** a system complete with, according to Adalah,
the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, more than 50 laws
that discriminate against Palestinians --- such as the new [nation-state
law](https://www.newsweek.com/israel-passes-nation-state-law-amid-accusations-racism-and-apartheid-1032630)
that says explicitly that only Jewish Israelis have the right of
self-determination in Israel, ignoring the rights of the Arab minority
that makes up 21 percent of the population.

#### There are several impacts caused by Israel's relationship with the United States

**[\$24.1 billion in Foreign Military Financing]{.underline}**]{.mark}
(FMF) [**[to]{.underline}** **[Israel]{.underline}**]{.mark}. \[7\] With
this taxpayer money, the United States licensed, paid for and delivered
more than 670,903,390 weapons, rounds of ammunition and related
equipment to Israel, valued at \$18.866 billion**[, [through
three]{.mark}]{.underline}** major **[[weapons transfer
programs]{.underline}]{.mark}** during this same period. (The remaining
approximately \$5.25 billion---or 22 percent of the total
appropriation---was presumably spent by Israel on its own domestic
weapons industry, a unique legislative exemption for Israel noted
above.) **[[These]{.underline}]{.mark}** three programs [**[included:
•]{.underline}** **[Foreign Military Sales]{.underline}**]{.mark}
([FMS]{.underline}). [**[Through this program, the]{.mark}** **[Defense
Department]{.mark}**]{.underline} contracted, financed and [**[delivered
to Israel]{.mark}**]{.underline} more than [**[9,500 weapons, valued
at]{.mark}**]{.underline} more than [**[\$10 billion]{.underline}**.
**[• Direct Commercial Sales]{.underline}**]{.mark} ([DCS]{.underline}).
Through this program, the State Department [[**approved
the**]{.underline}]{.mark} licensing, financing, and [**[delivery to
Israel of]{.mark}**]{.underline} more than **[[670 million
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[valued at]{.underline}]{.mark}** more
than [\$**[8.5 billion]{.mark}**]{.underline}. • Excess Defense Articles
(EDA). Through this program, the Defense Department delivered more than
5,200 used weapons to Israel, valued at more than \$42 million. During
this 10-year period, the United States provided the Israeli military, at
U.S. taxpayer expense, with nearly 500 different categories of weapons
and related military equipment, ranging from the truly mundane---one
used food steamer, valued at \$2,100---to the most sophisticated and
advanced U.S. weapons systems---93 F-16D fighter jets, valued at nearly
\$2.5 billion---and running the gamut of everything in between. \[8\]
**[[Due to the quantity]{.mark}]{.underline}** and scope **[[of U.S.
weapons deliveries to]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
**[[Israeli]{.mark}]{.underline}** military**[, [it
is]{.mark}]{.underline}** highly **[[unlikely

**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates complicit in and partly
**[[responsible for]{.mark}]{.underline}** all of **[[Israel\'s military
actions]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the human rights abuses it routinely
commits against Palestinians in its 44-year military occupation of the
West Bank, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. Civilian
Fatalities Indeed[, **[U.S. weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline} to Israel
have [**[had a devastating impact]{.mark}**]{.underline} upon
Palestinians who live under Israeli military occupation.
[**[During]{.mark}**]{.underline} roughly the same period in which the
United States provided more than 670 million weapons and related
military equipment to Israel---September 29, **[[2000
to]{.underline}]{.mark}** December 31, **[[2009---the Israeli military
killed]{.mark}]{.underline}** at least **[[2,969 Palestinians]{.mark}
[who took no part in hostilities in the West
Bank]{.mark}]{.underline}**, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza
Strip, according to the Israeli human rights organization B\'Tselem, the
Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories.
Among these fatalities were **[[at least 1,128 Palestinian
children]{.underline}]{.mark}** less than 18 years of age. \[9\] These
killings thereby systematically violated the most fundamental human
right to life (Article 3, Universal Declaration of Human Rights).
**[[These]{.mark} [statistics do not include]{.mark}]{.underline}** an
estimated **[[1,191 Lebanese who]{.underline}]{.mark}**, according to
Lebanese authorities, **[[were killed by the Israeli
military]{.underline}]{.mark}** during its July-August 2006 war against
Lebanon. A United Nations commission found that the war had a
\"devastating impact\" on Lebanese civilians and that [**[the Israeli
military \"did not give]{.mark}**]{.underline} effective
[**[warning]{.mark}**]{.underline} as required under international
humanitarian law\" **[[to minimize civilian
casualties]{.underline}]{.mark}**. \[10\] In addition, the statistics do
not include 12 foreign nationals, including U.S. citizen Rachel Corrie,
killed by the Israeli military in the Occupied Palestinian Territories
since September 29, 2000; \[11\] nor do they include the nine foreign
nationals, including U.S. citizen Furkan Dogan, killed by the Israeli
military in international waters on May 31, 2010 aboard an international
flotilla of humanitarian ships attempting to break Israel\'s illegal
siege of the Gaza Strip. \[12\] In many instances, such as those
detailed in the subsequent case studies, the linkage between Israel\'s
violations of Palestinians\' right to life and its reliance on U.S.
weapons to commit these human rights violations is evident. For example,
on July 22, 2002, Israel deliberately dropped a one-ton bomb from a
U.S.-provided F-16 fighter jet on a Gaza City apartment in an
extrajudicial assassination of Hamas member Salah Shehadeh that also
killed 14 Palestinian civilians, including eight children. \[13\] The
Bush Administration deemed it a \"heavy-handed action that is not
consistent with dedication to peace in the Middle East\" and a
\"deliberate attack against a building in which civilians were known to
be located.\" \[14\] This bombing prompted a class action lawsuit in
U.S. federal courts on behalf of Palestinians killed or injured, against
Avi Dichter, former director of Israel\'s General Security Service
(GSS), for claims under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) and Torture Victim
Protection Act (TVPA). \[15\] So far there has been no legal action
against the U.S. manufacturers of the F-16 or the U.S. officials who
authorized its purchase with U.S. tax dollars despite knowledge of
Israel\'s pattern and practice of such violations. Case Study #1: Tear
Gas Since 2000, the [**[Israeli military has
killed]{.mark}**]{.underline} at least five
**[[Palestinians]{.underline}]{.mark}** and gravely injured two U.S.
citizens **[[with tear gas]{.underline}]{.mark}**. On June 13, 2002, the
Israeli military killed 62-year-old Khader \'Abd al-Fatah al-Gharbi in
his East Jerusalem home after he inhaled tear gas from more than 20
grenades thrown into his house by soldiers. On June 29, 2002, the
Israeli military killed 14-year-old Muhammad Ahmad Mabareq a-Shtewi in
the al-Far\'a refugee camp. After he collapsed from being hit in the
chest with a rubber bullet, an Israeli soldier fired a tear gas canister
that exploded near his face, killing him. \[16\] Israel repeatedly has
misused U.S.-supplied tear gas to break up Palestinian nonviolent
protests. Israeli soldiers often have fired high-velocity tear gas
canisters directly and deliberately at protesters, in contravention of
the weapon\'s operating manual, to gravely injure and kill both
Palestinians and U.S. citizens. The Abu Rahmah family, whose members
have played central roles in organizing weekly nonviolent protests
against Israel\'s expropriation of land for its illegal settlements and
wall in the West Bank village of Bil\'in, have paid a particularly
devastating price as a result of Israel\'s misuse of tear gas. Israeli
soldiers killed 29-year-old Bassem Abu Rahmah on April 17, 2009, when he
was hit in the chest with a high-velocity tear gas canister. His sister,
36-year-old Jawaher, died of cardiac arrest on January 1, 2011, after
inhaling tear gas fired into her village by Israeli soldiers the
previous day. \[17\] On March 13, 2009, 37-year-old U.S. citizen Tristan
Anderson was critically injured after an Israeli soldier shot him in the
head with a high-velocity tear gas canister in the West Bank village of
Ni\'lin while he was observing a nonviolent Palestinian protest. The
tear gas canister made a large hole in his forehead, causing brain
damage and leaving him largely paralyzed. On May 31, 2010, 21-year-old
U.S. citizen Emily Henochowicz was also struck in the face by a
high-velocity tear gas canister fired by an Israeli soldier during a
demonstration against Israel\'s attack on the Gaza Freedom Flotilla at
the Qalandia checkpoint outside of Jerusalem. She lost her left eye as a
result. \[18\] On December 9, 2011, an Israeli soldier fired a
high-velocity tear gas canister from an armored vehicle directly at
28-year-old Mustafa Tamimi, of the West Bank village of Nabi Saleh. The
projectile hit him in the face and he died of his wounds the next day.
\[19\] In the cases of Bassem and Jawaher Abu Rahmah, Tristan Anderson,
Emily Henochowicz and Mustafa Tamimi, there is evidence that the
high-velocity tear gas canisters were supplied to the Israeli military
by Combined Systems, Inc. (CSI) of Jamestown, PA. \[20\] From FY2000 to
2009, the State Department licensed---and U.S. taxpayers funded---the
delivery of more than 595,000 tear gas canisters and other \"riot
control\" equipment to the Israeli military, valued at more than \$20.5
million. \[21\] In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012
(P.L.112-74), a new provision in the Foreign Military Financing program
stipulates that \"not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act and
6 months thereafter, the Secretary of State shall submit a report to the
Committees on Appropriations detailing any crowd control items,
including tear gas, made available with appropriated funds or through
export licenses to foreign security forces that the Secretary of State
has credible information have repeatedly used excessive force to repress
peaceful, lawful, and organized dissent.\" In light of the cases cited
above, the State Department is obligated to include in this report
Israel\'s misuse of tear gas and other crowd control items to injure and
kill civilians participating in nonviolent protests. Case Study #2:
House Demolitions [**[Israel commits]{.mark}**]{.underline} numerous
human rights [**[abuses]{.mark}**]{.underline} of Palestinians [**[with
specially-made bulldozers]{.mark}**]{.underline} supplied by the Peoria,
IL-based corporation Caterpillar. These abuses include, but are not
limited to: the destruction of houses, private property and public
infrastructure, the uprooting of crops, and the construction of
Israel\'s illegal settlements and the West Bank Separation Wall, which
was ruled to be illegal by the International Court of Justice in July
2004. \[22\] Since 1967, Israel has destroyed an estimated 24,813
Palestinian homes in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem,
and the Gaza Strip. \[23\] In the course of [these **[home
demolitions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, often carried out with
specially-constructed Caterpillar bulldozers armored by the Israeli
military to facilitate military operations, Israel has **[[killed 21
unarmed Palestinians]{.underline}]{.mark}**, including seven children.
Among those killed were: • Eight members of the al-Sho\'bi family in
Nablus, who were crushed to death when the Israeli military destroyed
their home in April 2002 and failed to give them adequate time to
evacuate beforehand; • Jamal Fayed, a paralyzed man whose relatives
informed Israeli soldiers that he was inside the house about to be
demolished, who was crushed to death in April 2002 in the Jenin refugee
camp in the West Bank; and • Ibrahim Khalafallah, a man in his seventies
unable to move without assistance, who was crushed to death in his home
in the Khan Younis refugee camp, Gaza Strip, in June 2004. In addition
to these fatalities, the Israeli military killed Rachel Corrie, a
23-year-old U.S. citizen from Olympia, WA, on March 16, 2003, with a
Caterpillar D9 bulldozer as she nonviolently attempted to protect a
Palestinian home from being demolished in Rafah, Gaza Strip. \[24\]
Unlike the case of tear gas, the data for which is based on publicly
available records, the total quantity and value of Caterpillar
**[[bulldozers]{.underline}]{.mark}** transferred from the United States
to Israel is not known, as neither the Defense Department nor State
Department has an explicit category for bulldozers in their published
reports. The bulldozers [**[may be categorized under]{.mark}**
\"]{.underline}Other Commercial Vehicles\" in **[[the
F]{.underline}]{.mark}**oreign **[[M]{.underline}]{.mark}**ilitary
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ales program, **[[which amounted to \$87.9
million]{.underline}]{.mark}** from FY2000 to 2009. This figure would
appear to be in line with a document submitted by Caterpillar in a U.S.
federal court case, Corrie et. al. v. Caterpillar, Inc., which sought
redress for people killed by Israel with Caterpillar bulldozers. In this
document, Caterpillar admitted that its transfers of bulldozers to
Israel are **[[approved by the Defense Security Cooperation
Agency]{.underline}]{.mark}** (an agency within the Department of
Defense) and paid for by U.S. taxpayers through Foreign Military
Financing. In one such deal, U.S. taxpayers provided \$32.6 million for
Israel\'s purchase of 50 Caterpillar D9 bulldozers. \[25\] In October
2010, in the midst of a civil trial in Israeli court brought by the
Corrie family against the Israeli military, Israel\'s Channel 2 news
reported that Caterpillar had delayed the delivery of tens of D9
bulldozers---valued at \$50 million---to the Israeli military. The
report speculated that this \"sounds like an American military
sanction.\" Neither the Department of State nor Caterpillar confirmed or
denied the report, and it remains unclear whether U.S. deliveries of
bulldozers to the Israeli military have resumed. \[26\] Case Study #3:
White Phosphorous During \"Operation Cast Lead,\"
**[[Israel]{.mark}\'s]{.underline}** December 2008---January 2009 air,
land and sea attack on the blockaded Gaza Strip, which killed 1,419
Palestinians, 1,167 of whom were civilians (82.2 percent), and injured
5,300, \[27\] the Israeli military **[[fired white phosphorous artillery
shells]{.underline}]{.mark}** at at least five civilian targets,
including a UN compound, two hospitals and a civilian home. \[28\] These
munitions contain 116 felt wedges soaked in white phosphorus, which
ignite and burn for up to seven minutes upon contact with oxygen. The
chemical is oil and fat soluble, leaving those who are exposed to it
with severe burns that can penetrate to the bone. Reports from the
Israeli military and Ministry of Health, cited by Human Rights Watch,
also conclude that white phosphorous exposure can cause \"kidney failure
and infections,\" is \"extremely destructive to tissue,\" can lead to
[\"**[systemic poisoning]{.mark}**\"]{.underline} and \"can
[[**cause**]{.underline}]{.mark} serious injury and
**[[death]{.underline}]{.mark}** when it comes into contact with the
skin, is inhaled or is swallowed.\" \[29\] On January 4, 2009, a white
phosphorous shell hit the Abu Halima house in Sifaya, a village near
Beit Lahiya in the Gaza Strip. 16 members of the family were taking
shelter in the house at the time of the attack. \"According to family
members who survived,\" stated a UN report, \"there was intense fire and
white smoke in the room, the walls of which were glowing red. Five
members of the family died immediately or within a short period:
Muhammad Sa\'ad Abu Halima (aged 45) and four of his children, sons Abd
al-Rahim Sa\'ad (aged 14), Zaid (aged 12) and Hamza (aged 8), and
daughter Shahid (aged 18 months). Muhammad Sa\'ad and Abd al-Rahim
Sa\'ad were decapitated, the others burnt to death. Five members of the
family escaped and suffered various degrees of burns: Sabah Abu Halima,
her sons Youssef (aged 16) and Ali (aged 4), daughter-in-law Ghada (aged
21), and Ghada\'s daughter Farah (aged 2).\" Two other family
members---Muhammad Hekmat Abu Halima and Matar Abu Halima---were
subsequently shot and killed by Israeli soldiers while trying to
transport wounded survivors to a hospital. \[30\] Researchers from Human
Rights Watch noted that **[[all]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the **[[white
phosphorus shells]{.underline}]{.mark}** they found [**[in
Gaza]{.underline}** **[were]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[manufactured in
the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates with
markings denoting their production in April 1989 by Tiokol Aerospace,
which then operated the Louisiana Army Ammunition Plant. Reuters also
photographed an Israeli artillery unit near Gaza handling M825A1 shells
on January 4, 2009, with lot numbers indicating they were produced in
the United States at Pine Bluff Arsenal in September 1991. \[31\] As a
result of its investigation, Human Rights Watch concluded that
\"Israel\'s use of white phosphorus munitions during the armed conflict
in Gaza violated international humanitarian law\" and called upon the
United States to halt the transfer of this weapon to Israel until the
United States conducts an investigation into Israel\'s violations of
international and U.S. arms export laws. \[32\] **[[Due to the lack
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** specificity in **[[publicly available reports
from the Department of State]{.underline}]{.mark}** and Department of
Defense, **[[the exact]{.underline}]{.mark}** quantity and **[[value of
U.S. exports of white]{.mark} [phosphorous shells to Israel is not
known]{.mark}.]{.underline}** White phosphorous is fired from 155mm
artillery shells. From 2000 to 2009, the Department of Defense provided
Israel with \$11.38 million worth of cartridges in the range of
105mm-155mm, some of which may have been white phosphorous shells.
\[33\] Additional Human Rights Violations In addition to U.S. weapons
playing a primary role in Israel\'s killing of unarmed Palestinians,
Israel misuses U.S. weapons to commit additional human rights abuses of
Palestinians while enforcing its 44-year military occupation of the West
Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip. From September 28, 2000, to April
2, 2011, the Israeli military and settlers injured an estimated 51,328
Palestinians, including 17,532 with rubber-coated steel bullets, 9,126
with live ammunition, and 6,981 with tear gas. Among those Palestinians
injured, 3,643 were permanently disabled or maimed. \[34\] From 2007 to
2009, [**[the Department of State licensed the export of 47 million
rounds]{.mark}**]{.underline} of ammunition to Israel, valued at \$9.5
million, \[35\] more than [**[enough to]{.mark}**]{.underline} injure or
[**[kill every Palestinian]{.mark}**]{.underline} living under Israeli
military occupation **[[10 times]{.mark}]{.underline}** over. This
massive injuring of Palestinians, many of whom are civilians, is a
violation of the right to security of person (Article 3, Universal
Declaration of Human Rights). The U.S. arming and equipping of the
Israeli military also implicates U.S. taxpayers in Israel\'s wholesale
and deliberate destruction of Palestinian civilian infrastructure. In
addition to the wide-scale policy of demolishing Palestinian homes,
mentioned above, [**[the Israeli military has]{.mark}**]{.underline}
over the years routinely attacked and
[[**destroyed**]{.underline}]{.mark} schools, hospitals, businesses,
agriculture, roads, water treatment and electrical generation plants,
the Gaza airport and other [**[public
infrastructure]{.mark}**]{.underline} and private businesses. The damage
done to the civilian infrastructure of the Gaza Strip during \"Operation
Cast Lead\" alone provides one measure. Israel damaged or destroyed
11,154 housing units, 211 industrial premises, 703 stores, 100 other
commercial and public premises, 6,271 dunams of agricultural land, and
448,298 trees. \[36\] Initial estimates pegged the damage to Palestinian
civilian infrastructure at nearly \$2 billion. \[37\] The destruction of
real or personal property by an Occupying Power is prohibited except
where absolutely necessary by military operations (Article 53, Fourth
Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time
of War, cited hereafter as the Fourth Geneva Convention). A UN report
debunked the notion that this deliberate destruction was \"absolutely
necessary.\" Instead it \"categorically denounced\" Israel\'s own claims
that the operation\'s reliance upon \"disproportionate force, attacks on
civilian population and the destruction of civilian property are
legitimate means to achieve Israel\'s military and political
objectives.\" \[38\] U.S. weapons also play a direct and indirect role
in facilitating Israel\'s restrictions on Palestinians\' right to
freedom of movement. Israel has for years maintained hundreds of
roadblocks and checkpoints in the West Bank, the number of which stood
at 522 in September 2011. \[39\] The wall Israel has built within the
West Bank, which was declared illegal by the International Court of
Justice in July 2004, also severely restricts Palestinian movement. The
Court ruled that \"all States are under an obligation not to recognize
the illegal situation arising from the construction of the wall, not to
render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation and to co-operate
with a view to putting an end to the alleged violations and to ensuring
that reparation will be made therefor.\" \[40\] Nevertheless, the United
States continued to provide direct assistance to Israel that effectively
makes the wall permanent[.]{.underline} The Emergency Supplemental
Appropriations Act of 2005 (P.L.109-13) provided \$200 million for
\"programs, activities, and efforts to support Palestinians,\" but gave
\$50 million of this to Israel \"to help ease the movement of
Palestinian people and goods in and out of Israel.\" \[41\] With this
money, Israel planned to build 34 terminals at \"crossing points along
the revised route of the security fence.\" \[42\] These systematic
restrictions violate Palestinians\' rights to freedom of movement and
residence (Article 13(1), Universal Declaration of Human Rights).
Finally, [[U**.S. weapons are**]{.mark}
**[employed]{.mark}**]{.underline} directly and indirectly by the
Israeli military [**[to]{.mark}**]{.underline} build and
[**[expand]{.mark}**]{.underline} illegal Israeli
**[[settlements]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the West Bank and East
Jerusalem, [**[and]{.mark}**]{.underline} to commit human rights abuses
of Palestinians in the course of building, expanding and maintaining
these settlements, including, but not limited to, [**[the expropriation
of Palestinian land and agriculture]{.mark}**.]{.underline} There are
currently 152 recognized Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East
Jerusalem \[43\] and, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, 650,000 Israelis live on land occupied by Israel since 1967.
\[44\] A 1979 Department of State legal opinion found Israel\'s
settlements to be \"inconsistent with international law.\" \[45\] An
Occupying Power is prohibited from transferring parts of its own
civilian population into territory it occupies (Article 49, Fourth
Geneva Convention).

#### Second, the genocidal logic of Israeli settler colonialism is founded on the ontological elimination of Indigenous populations. The structure of settler society pervades institutions, discussions and advocacy, imposing a total end to Palestinian life as foundation to the existence of Israeli social consciousness.

Introduction: Lemkin's sociological concept Genocide is far more than an
international crime or condemnatory label of rhetorical utility. It is a
concept with a rich intellectual history and is now a vibrant field of
social scientific inquiry to which numerous sociologists contribute.
Writing in this journal, Damien Short1 recently surveyed the history of
sociology's engagement with the concept, from initial reluctance to
contemporary engagement, and argued that what is needed from
sociologists working in the field of human rights today is more research
into the context and manner in which
**[[vulnerable]{.underline}]{.mark}** distinct cultural **[[groups are
forcibly 'changing' in the face of continuing settler colonial
expansionist projects driven by global capitalism and a 'logic of
elimination']{.underline}]{.mark}**.2 Such research, he argued, should
utilise the analytical lens of genocide as assaults on the 'essential
foundations of life of national groups' are what the concept was
designed to highlight and prohibit. Indeed, in 1933 Polish jurist
Raphael Lemkin spoke at the International Conference for Unification of
Criminal Law in Madrid, and urged the international community to
converge on the necessity to ban the destruction, both physical and
cultural,of human groups, invoking the linked concepts of 'barbarity'
and 'vandalism'. In his subsequent seminal text Axis Rule in Occupied
Europe Lemkin combined his prior formulations, barbarity and vandalism,
to form a new, more comprehensive master concept -- genocide, combining
the Greek word genos meaning tribe or race and the Latin cide meaning
killing.3 In this important book Lemkin constructed **[[a sociological
ontology of genocide]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- with Chapter IX in
particular 'implying sociological claims about the nature or structure
of nations and the necessary conditions for their survival'4 -- and
detailed eight 'techniques' of genocidal destruction that were employed
during the Nazi occupation of Europe: political, social, cultural,
economic, biological, physical, religious and moral.5 Lemkin's
sociology, and the analytical framework he constructed in Axis Rule and
later unpublished works, is crucial to our understanding of genocide as
a socially destructive phenomena and also as an analytical concept. For
Lemkin, genocide **[[was a 'total social practise']{.underline}]{.mark}6
[[affecting the 'essential foundations of life' of social
groups]{.underline}]{.mark},** and crucially for this article, it is
intrinsically linked to processes of colonisation: **[[Genocide
has]{.mark} [two phases:]{.mark}]{.underline} [[one, destruction of the
national pattern of the oppressed group: the]{.mark} [other, the
imposition of the national pattern of the
oppressor]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This imposition, in turn, may be made
upon the oppressed population which is allowed to remain, or upon the
territory alone, after removal of the population and the colonization of
the area by the oppressor's own nationals.7 It was with good reason that
Lemkin titled his book on the Nazi empire Axis Rule in Occupied Europe
in order to place it, as Dirk Moses points out, in the Las Casas
influenced 'tradition of criticizing brutal conquests. Genocide for
Lemkin, then, was a special form of foreign conquest and occupation. It
was necessarily imperial and colonial in nature. In particular, genocide
aimed to permanently tip the demographic balance in favor of the
occupier.'8 This article continues a recent trend in genocide studies
that refers back to Lemkin's work to better understand his intended
meaning of the concept and its links to colonial processes. While the
terms 'settler colonial' and 'genocidal' have both been used before by
critics of the State of Israel, with reference to its policies towards
the Palestinian peoples, this article aims to apply a Lemkin-inspired
genocide perspective to the Palestinian situation. Whilst this is not
the first attempt to consider the case through the analytical lens of
genocide,9 it offers a different approach by closely following Lemkin's
understanding, the 'techniques' he elaborated and the nexus with
colonialism. Genocide, culture and settler colonialism Due to the
tireless lobbying of Lemkin, a modified version of his concept was
eventually codified in international law as the 1948 Convention on the
Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. 10 As Curthoys and
Docker point out, this has led to confusion between two definitions for
genocide, between 'the discursive definition in chapter nine of Axis
Rule and the codified definition of the 1948 Genocide Convention'.11 The
codified definition is the only internationally accepted legal
definition of genocide and is enshrined in Article II(a) to (e) of the
Genocide Convention,12 currently accepted by the 142 states parties to
the Genocide Convention.13 Whilst this definition was based on Lemkin's
initial concept of genocide, due to political influences and adaptations
during the drafting process the definition was narrower than Lemkin had
originally intended.14 According to Lemkin, 'cultural genocide is the
most important part of the convention'15 and he was disappointed that
this aspect of genocide was not ultimately included in the Genocide
Convention.16 An initial draft of Article II of the convention
classified as genocidal the destruction of the specific character of a
persecuted 'group' by forced transfer of children, forced exile (i.e.
mass expulsion), prohibition of the use of the national language,
destruction of books, documents, monuments and objects of historical,
artistic or religious value.17 Even so, out of the two definitions that
Lemkin helped to create, the legal definition has, inevitably, been the
predominant definition of genocide. Furthermore, the fact that the
genocide concept was formed during the context of World War II has meant
that the Holocaust deeply influenced its conception and the subsequent
understanding of the term by scholars. Moshman argues, 'the primary
conceptual constraint on thinking about genocide\...is the dominance of
a Holocaust-based conception of genocide'.18 A view of the Holocaust as
the 'ultimate expression'19 of genocide has led to it commonly being the
example case that other potential genocides are compared against. By the
mid-1980s the perception that genocide 'equals mass murder' was 'an
orthodoxy of sorts'.20 As Martin Shaw writes: '**[[because Genocide has
been narrowed]{.underline}]{.mark}** down to Nazi-like extermination
policies, **[[few recent cases have been
recognised]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Only that of Rwanda (1994) has been
overwhelmingly accepted, since the campaign against the Tutsis involved
physical destruction'.21 For Dirk Moses, this reductionist
interpretation of genocide dismisses the validity of the experience of
other genocide victims: the establishment of the Holocaust as **[[the
threshold of trauma]{.underline}]{.mark}** in western modernity
conveniently **[[renders invisible the experience of trauma]{.underline}
[that has driven the vengeful yet redemptive politics]{.underline} [of
minorities and displaced peoples]{.underline}]{.mark}** for centuries,
**[[including]{.underline}]{.mark}**, significantly, **[[the Palestinian
one]{.underline}]{.mark}**.22 This trend has meant that 'from a legal
perspective, genocide unaccompanied by mass killing is rare, and has
stood little chance of being prosecuted',23 even though it is not
actually necessary for anyone to be killed in order for genocide to take
place under the Genocide Convention's definition. For Lemkin, however,
emphasis was placed more on the destruction of the rudiments of social
and cultural existence than on mass murder: Generally speaking, genocide
does not necessarily mean the immediate destruction of a nation, except
when accomplished by mass killing of all members of a nation. It is
intended rather to signify a coordinated plan of different actions
aiming at the destruction of the essential foundations of the life of
national groups, with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves. The
objectives of such a plan would be disintegration of the political and
social institutions of culture, language, national feelings, religion,
and the economic existence of national groups, and the destruction of
the personal security, liberty, health, dignity, and even the lives of
the individuals belonging to such groups. Genocide is directed against
the national group as an entity, and the actions involved are directed
against individuals, not in their individual capacity, but as members of
the national group.24 A key strand of recent genocide scholarship
focuses on the nexus we mentioned earlier: between colonisation
processes25 and genocidal practices.26 Lemkin defines the genocide
concept as being 'intrinsically colonial'.27 Taking up this connection,
some contemporary writers like Churchill28 concur that where the
practice of imposing the 'national pattern' of the colonial oppressor is
the result of 'policy', it should indeed be considered genocidal. Jean
Paul Sartre stated that 'Colonialization is\...necessarily a cultural
genocide'.29 This view has since been expanded by others such as
**[[Card]{.underline}]{.mark}** who [**[describes genocide as
a]{.underline}** ['**social death'**]{.underline}]{.mark}.30 For Abed,
**[[it is this 'social death']{.underline} [that makes acts
genocidal]{.underline}]{.mark}**.31 This focus on the genocidal nature
of destroying a group culture is, as we have seen, similar to Lemkin's
own position. He wrote: 'the destruction of cultural symbols is
genocide'.32 To destroy their function 'menaces the existence of the
social group which exists by virtue of its common culture'.33 Lemkin
also recognised that national groups do not last forever, and
differentiated between cultural change and cultural genocide, when
nations either 'fade away after having exhausted their spiritual and
physical energies'34 and 'when they are murdered on the highway of world
history. Dying of age or disease is a disaster but genocide is a
crime'.35 Due to political opposition, the cultural method of genocide
is absent in the final text of the Genocide Convention. It was, however,
present in the draft stages and the term 'cultural genocide' was also
included in Article 7 of the draft United Nations Declaration on the
Rights of Indigenous Peoples.36 Whilst the method is not present in the
final text, its initial inclusion suggests that the concept is still a
valid one, despite the lack of support at state-level. As Moses points
out 'although indigenous people often regard assimilation and
development policies as genocidal or at least culturally genocidal, we
know that they have no legal protection from the UN Genocide Convention.
'"Cultural genocide" is of rhetorical effect only'.37 Despite its lack
of currency from a legal perspective, 'cultural genocide' was integral
to Lemkin's understanding of genocide38 and during the process of
construction of the draft UN Convention, Lemkin argued that 'Cultural
Genocide is the most important part of the Convention'39 and
consequently we will not ignore this dimension here. When considering
genocide within a colonial context it is also important to acknowledge
that Lemkin never stipulated that perpetration of the crime of genocide
was limited to state actors.40 This is also made explicit in Article 4
of the Convention, which states that 'persons committing
genocide\...shall be punished, whether they are constitutionally
responsible rulers, public officials or private individuals'.41 This is
extremely relevant when examining the destructive nature of settler
colonialist societies, as in some cases the settlers may commit acts of
genocide despite it not being the official state practice. This
consequently raises the question as to what extent any genocides
committed by such settlers can be seen as a function of colonialism
itself. If some rogue settlers commit such acts, it would seem unfair to
blame the colonial authorities, or assume there was a deliberate intent
endorsed and enforced by them. It is, therefore, a complex evidential
issue. The Australian academic Tony Barta perceives one possibility as
being what he terms a 'genocidal society' -- as distinct from a
genocidal state -- one in which the bureaucratic apparatus might
officially be directed to protect innocent people but in which a whole
race is nevertheless subject to remorseless pressures of destruction
inherent in the very nature of the society.42 Thus the motives of the
colonisers may be 'muddled and obscure'.43 It could be argued that such
destruction of indigenous peoples cannot be described as 'genocide'
since they are not intentionally being targeted for who they are, but
rather are simply in the way of the colonisers and the land they seek to
possess, or as Rose deftly stated 'to get in the way of settler
colonization, all the native has to do is stay at home'.44 Many scholars
have sought to counter that argument, including Ce´saire who declared
that 'no one colonizes innocently'45 and Curthoys who concluded that:
'to seek to take the land whatever the consequences\...is surely a
genocidal process'.46 Abed asserts that many indigenous groups are
'territorially bounded'.47 For him, therefore,
[[**removing**]{.underline}]{.mark} these [**[groups from their
land]{.mark}**]{.underline} or to control their interaction with it [[is
**inevitably a genocidal practice.**]{.underline} **[As Wolfe
explains:]{.underline}** '**[Land is life]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[--]{.underline} or, at least, land is necessary for life. Thus contests
for land can be -- indeed, often are -- contests for life'.48 The
production of new, permanent societies -- forged on the back of an
entrenched logic of racism in order to protect the cultural character of
the settler population, and utterly destroy the indigenous world --
establishes settler colonialism not as 'an essentially fleeting stage',
but rather a 'persistent defining characteristic of this new world
settler society'.49 As Wolfe illustrates with reference to Australia,
'[**[the]{.mark}**]{.underline} determination ["**[settler-colonial
state]{.mark}**]{.underline}**[" [is]{.underline}]{.mark}** Australian
[[**society's** **primary structural
characteristic**]{.mark}]{.underline} rather than merely a statement
about its origins'.50 **[[Settler colonialism]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
therefore, [**[is a 'structure not an]{.underline}**
**[event']{.underline}**]{.mark}51; it is a phenomenon, which consists
of complex social formations, and significantly, it exists and develops
continually with time and thus Wolfe proposes that 'structural genocide'
be the term used in such settler colonial contexts.52 The structurally
defining settler colonial logic typically produces societies marked by
'pervasive inequalities, usually codified in law, between the settler
and indigenous populations'.53 This settler-indigene division is usually
pervasive throughout the economy and the legal and political systems,
manifested by institutionalised settler privilege. Such privilege,
inherent in this form of colonialism, arguably 'denies human rights to
human beings whom it has subdued by violence\...since **[[the native is
subhuman]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the Declaration of Human Rights does
not apply to \[them\] ~~him'~~.54 Moreover, under such settler
colonialism collective rights such as self-determination and political
sovereignty are also denied. As David Lloyd recently observed: I was
**[[trying to think Palestine]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Palestine [**[for
itself]{.mark}**,]{.underline} 'itself
**[[alone']{.underline}]{.mark}**, as the Irish say. But instead, [**[I
found myself thinking]{.mark}**,]{.underline} and writing,
**['[Palestine/Israel']{.mark}]{.underline}**, as if **[[Palestine
cannot be thought of and by itself]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This gesture
is one that proponents of **[[Zionism]{.underline}]{.mark}** have
**[[succeeded in imposing]{.underline}]{.mark}** as **[[a condition for
even thinking about Palestine]{.underline}]{.mark}**: **[[it cannot be
thought]{.underline}]{.mark}**, rather, may not be thought, **[[as an
autonomous sovereign entity]{.mark},]{.underline}** giving the law to
itself. [**[Palestinian nationality]{.mark}**,]{.underline} Palestinian
statehood, if they can be contemplated at all, **[[can only be proposed
by permission of Israel]{.mark}]{.underline}** and its patrons.55

race]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\' Further, \'Israel and Australia are like
sisters in Asia. We are located in Asia but without the characteristics
of Asians, our skin is not yellow nor are our eyes slanted.\' In these
examples settlers call for solidarity with other settler societies based
on the mere fact of being settlers themselves (Here Barack Obama is
positioned solely in his role as President of a settler colony. Black
people , whether native or not, are not settlers in white settler
colonies that deny their very humanity).\<nl/\> Indigenous removal is
the practice that binds the settler colonies but apart from the far
right-wing, it is absent from settler discourse. There is a shared
narrative of building nations without destroying the nations they
encountered, of conquest without any conquered. The conscious alliance
building is not around indigenous removal but around the racial and
economic formations indigenous removal produced.\<nl/\> Settler
discourse points to other settler colonies to determine who will be
allowed to join the colony. Harvard University professor George Borjas
writes\[4\] in The Washington Post, \'While the United States has proven
cautious about addressing \[what kind and how many immigrants it
wants\], several other \'nations of immigrants\' (including Canada,
Australia and New Zealand) have far more proactive approaches to
immigration: They have devised systems that are designed to favor people
who will contribute economically to the country and who will assimilate
quickly.\' Borjas\' 2001 article is predated by around a century by the
various anti-Asian policies that South Africa, Australia (under the
Banner of \'White Australia\'), the U.S. (especially in California) and
Canada (especially in British Columbia) developed to restrict Asian
immigration. Marilyn Lake and Henry Reynolds examine in depth how the
various settler colonies\' anti-Asian policies influenced each other in
their 2008 volume Drawing the Global Colour Line. Australia, Canada and
South Africa during this period reoriented from British towards American
imperialism precisely to affirm racist immigration policies that
crystalized their respective formations of \'white\'. While the UK
half-heartedly defended rights of imperial subjects the U.S. offered
unconditional support for white supremacist immigration and colonization
policies in the other white settler colonies.\<nl/\>\<nl/\>Like all
organizations of power settler colonialism is normative, so even
critiques of the racist immigration policies like those Borjas advocates
can still affirm indigenous removal. Judd Yadid writes in Haaretz\[5\]
about Australian Jewish hostility to South African Jewish immigration.
\'Those Australian Jews that criticize the influx and eccentricities of
their South African brethren should show more empathy, and be mindful of
the fact that they themselves are the offspring of immigrants. In fact,
the entire non-indigenous population of the great southern land were
once newcomers.\' Yadid\'s examination looks beyond Australian Jewish
nativist hostility to South African Jews to critique Australia\'s racist
immigration policies. Yet in the end he manages to use a critique of
xenophobic racism to declare permanent settler colonialism. All
mainstream and much left-wing migrant justice discourse in settler
colonies does this, again under the banner of \'nation of
immigrants\'.\<nl/\> In the U.S. example **[[African Slavery

Israel were two of the few countries that supported settler rule in
South Africa nearly until the end and the three nations built the
backbone of \'counterterrorism\' policies and technologies based upon
tactics and philosophies developed to support settler rule in each. The
U.S. and Israel supported the South African apartheid regime with arms
and trade assistance while Israel also contributed troops for combat
fighting. John Collins in his book Global Palestine narrates how the
famous 1948-49 Berlin Airlift was carried out by \'a who\'s who of
settler colonialism,\' (United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand,
South Africa and the UK, the latter governing settler rule in Northern
Ireland and Southern Rhodesia at the time). The list goes on and

San Francisco 49ers mascot.\<nl/\> Settler colonies, apart from the far
Right-wing, rarely pronounce or conceive of their solidarity in terms of
indigenous removal and doing so is unnecessary. Settler colonialism is
an organization of power like capitalism, patriarchy or White supremacy.
Its power is not just political and geographic, but also discursive
producing a settler normativity - what Elizabeth Povinelli described as
the \'organization of sociality on the basis of the naturalness of a
civilizational displacement.\' It need not be spoken or even consciously
thought in hegemonic discourse. It is basic to settlers\' understanding
of the world. A common example in the United States is the popular NFL
football team the San Francisco 49ers. The original \'forty-niners were
populist genocidaires\[7\]. The historical formation of the
\'forty-niner is inextricably tied to genocide and the conquest of
California\'s indigenous populace. Yet the football team is discursively
divorced from the practices of the actual \'forty-niners. Indigenous
removal is so basic to the settler cosmology that its daily celebrations
of the genocidaires - on currency, in street, school and team names, on
monuments, in holidays, etc. - pass unnoticed (by the settlers).
[**[Settler normativity is as much part of foreign policy as it is in
American governance]{.underline}**.]{.mark}\<nl/\> This is the lens
through which we should understand American Zionists - Christian, Jewish
or others - supporting Israel or the Israeli vigils in support of South
African Apartheid and other such manifestations[. **[They are settlers

this support**. [[Without the Israel Lobby the United States would still
support Israel for reasons of settler colonialism as foreign policy as

In this reading American settler colonialism explains the existence of
the Israel Lobby more than the Israel Lobby explains U.S. support for
Zionist settler colonialism.\<nl/\>Anti-Zionism as
Counternormativity\<nl/\>The strange mix of ferocity and dismissal in
U.S., Canadian and Australian support for Israel and rejection of
Palestine is too best understood through settler normativity. It is only
counternormative discourse that is so heavily attacked in the U.S.
Criticism of Israel is rejected with a fury approaching that directed at
feminists, anti-racists and anti-capitalists, especially intersections
thereof. It is to the extent that sometimes when native organizers and
scholars in the U.S. critique Zionism some Palestine-solidarity
activists can\'t even understand that it is criticism of Zionism because
U.S. settler colonialism is being similarly indicted! **[[Noting that
Israel is just like the U.S. is seen as a defense of Israel rather than
critique of both the U.S. and Israel.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The Israel
Lobby could only dream of such discursive power. But settler normativity
explains it well. When settler rule in Palestine falls, it will (likely)
be the first modern example of settler rule falling when the settlers
formed a majority of the population in the colony for any amount of
time. That should be (Beautifully! Wonderfully! Literally!) unsettling
to other settler societies, even those where settlers are the vast

The sedimented [**[histories of settler
colonialism]{.mark}**,]{.underline} US imperialism[, **[white supremacy,
and anti-blackness]{.mark} [suffuse contemporary
Palestine]{.mark}**]{.underline}**.** Familiar dynamics of indigenous
erasure drove the removal of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from
their land and homes in 1948. Yet it **[[is
through]{.underline}]{.mark}** the language of
**[[anti-blackness]{.underline}]{.mark}**---apartheid, open-air prison,
ghetto---that **[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}** ongoing **[[occupation of
the West Bank and Gaza have been legible to anti-Zionist
activists]{.underline}]{.mark}** around the globe. **[[In
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** second quarter of the **[[twentieth
century]{.mark},]{.underline}** Palestine experienced overlapping forms
of colonialism; the British ruled formally while abetting Zionist
settlement and the theft of Palestinian land. During this period,
**[[segregated South Africa served as]{.underline}]{.mark}** an
important **[[inspiration to Zionists]{.mark},]{.underline}** and South
Africa was notably the sole African nation to support the creation of
Israel in 1948.31 These simultaneous histories of colonization have
imparted **[[Palestine]{.underline}]{.mark}** with a degree of
fungibility---it **[[resonates as black and indigenous, colonial and
postcolonial]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Israel emerged as a fully-fledged
settler society at the very moment that liberal humanism triumphed
globally in the wake of the Second World War. The methods other settler
states used to such brutal effect for removing their indigenous
populations, such as outright genocide, forced assimilation, and the
separation of children from their families, were out of the question.
Thus [**[Palestinians]{.mark}**]{.underline} were and [**[continue to be
subject to]{.mark} [legalized discrimination]{.mark}**,]{.underline}
ghettoization, the **[[criminalization of protest, and
hyper-policing]{.underline}]{.mark}**---all **[[techniques familiar to
black Americans]{.underline}]{.mark}.** The structure of **[[Israeli
society]{.mark}]{.underline}** itself **[[does
not]{.mark}]{.underline}** easily **[[comport to the settler/indigenous
binary. It is organized by]{.mark}]{.underline}** the division between
**[[European Jews racialized as white, Arab Jews, and non-Jewish
Palestinian Arabs]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Despite being founded as a
Jewish state**[, [there persists a racialized divide among Israel's
Jewish population]{.mark}.]{.underline}** These slippages have inspired
a long history of black solidarity against the Israeli settler state
formation. The poet June Jordan, black American by way of Jamaica, once
wrote, "I was born a Black woman / and now / I am become a Palestinian."
Jordan was not expressing sympathy in the abstract, but rather
recognized the shared precariousness of black and Palestinian lives.
Identifying with these lines, Palestinian American poet Suheir Hammad
titled her first collection of poems Born Palestinian, Born Black. She
offered as explanation the idea that black could mean "Indians in
England, Africans in America, / Algerians in France, and Palestinians in
Israel." Such solidarities have played an important role in the history
of both black and Palestinian liberation, and the juxtaposition of the
two groups is more than mere analogy. In his work on Afro-Arab radical
thought, Alex Lubin observes, "Mizrahi Jews were called 'black Jews'"
and "put simply, racialized in Israel as black."32
[**[The]{.mark}**]{.underline} frequently [**[overlapping categories
of]{.mark} [Palestinian]{.mark}**,]{.underline} an indigenous colonial
identity[, **[and Arab Israeli]{.mark}**]{.underline}, an identity
racialized as black[, **[open new]{.mark} [ways of thinking about how
the structures of the Israeli settler state rely
upon]{.mark}**]{.underline} histories of **[[anti-blackness. Activists
have]{.mark}]{.underline}** productively **[[drawn on this fungibility
to produce modes of solidarity]{.mark}]{.underline}** that attend to
both racism and colonialism**[, [refusing a disavowal
of]{.mark}]{.underline}** the shared **[[histories of slavery,
anti-blackness, settler colonialism, and indigenous sovereignty in
Israel, the United States, and beyond]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Lubin
traces the beginnings of this history to the Long Civil Rights era. On
one side were organizations whose goals were full citizenship and legal
equality, such as the NAACP and the Urban League. These groups supported
Israel, seeing it as a democratic state founded by an aggrieved
minority, unburdened by the legal discrimination so prevalent in the
United States (they were unaware of or ignored the condition of
Palestinians).33 On the other side were organizations like SNCC and the
Black Panthers, which were centered around more capacious conceptions of
justice and included an anti-imperialist component. For these
organizations, it was Israel's status as a colonizer, rather than its
liberal, multicultural character, that influenced their orientation
toward it. **[[After 1975,]{.mark}]{.underline}** Israel strengthened
its ties to South Africa, and the Panthers began to argue that
**[[Zionism was simultaneously an imperialist and racist discourse.
Between 1968 and 1980, the Panthers]{.mark}]{.underline}** developed a
critique of the nationalist model in the Middle East and any attendant
anti-black racism. In other words, the Panthers critiqued the racism of
Arab nationalism and imagined a form of sovereignty incompatible with
racial exclusion. They even **[[inspired]{.mark}]{.underline}** a group
of **[[Arab Israelis]{.mark}]{.underline}** who
**[[called]{.mark}]{.underline}** themselves **[[the "Israeli
Panthers."]{.mark}]{.underline}** While the Israeli Panthers at first
sought only to end discrimination against Arab Jews within Israel**[,
[they]{.mark}]{.underline}** eventually **[[came to break with
Zionism]{.mark}]{.underline}** and oppose the occupation, and "would
eventually attempt to link the oppression of the Mizrahim to that of the
Palestinians."34 While Lubin is ultimately skeptical of the extent of
the Israeli Panthers' radical politics, their work highlights the ways
in which Arab racialization has justified both exclusion from the
settler state (Israeli Arabs as black) and colonization itself
(Palestinian Arabs as indigenous). **[[The politics of the Israeli
Panthers]{.mark} [makes the links between anti-blackness and settlement
manifest in ways that continue to resonate in the twenty-first century.
In]{.mark}]{.underline}** August **[[2014]{.mark},]{.underline}**
progressive **[[news sites]{.mark}]{.underline}** and social media
**[[were dominated by]{.mark}]{.underline}** two topics: protests in
**[[Ferguson]{.mark},]{.underline}** Missouri after the shooting of
Michael Brown**[, [and the Israeli invasion of
Gaza.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The chronological overlap between the two
events was coincidental, but activists in the United States and
Palestine were quick to transform coincidence into analysis. It began
when **[[Palestinian activists used Twitter to give
protestors]{.mark}]{.underline}** in Ferguson **[[advice for dealing
with tear gas]{.mark}.]{.underline}** And because of images showing a
militarized police presence in Ferguson, some reporters began using the
language of "occupation." It didn't take long before commentators began
to make parallels to the Israeli occupation. The twinned refrains,
"Occupation is a crime, from Ferguson to Palestine," and "Resistance is
not a crime, from Ferguson to Palestine" became popular in Ferguson and
beyond. These gestures continued: protestors blocking traffic on
California's San Mateo Bridge on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day in 2015
displaying an enormous Palestinian flag; Black Lives Matter activists
penning a letter of support for Indigenous People's Day later that year;
a teach-in about anti-black violence in the United States at a
Palestinian university; a delegation of Black Lives Matter activists
visiting Palestine.35 The culmination of this work was a "Black
Solidarity Statement with Palestine" that gave historical context for
the actions of the previous year.36 These expressions should not be
surprising. Black writers have long debated the relationship between
blackness and colonialism. One thinks of Fanon's famous claim, "Colonial
racism is no different from any other racism." Or Amiri Baraka's
comparison of black struggles to anticolonial struggles with his pithy
statement, "In America, black is a country." Not to mention James
Baldwin's description of Harlem as "occupied territory." And the black
freedom movement has served as inspiration for many global movements,
such as the Israeli Panthers. These intellectual alliances reflect
material overlap between policing blackness and upholding the colonial
status quo. There are numerous ties between US law enforcement agencies
and the Israeli military.37 If Palestinians were able to give activists
in Ferguson tips for dealing with tear gas, it was because
[**[the]{.mark}**]{.underline} same [**[US weapons manufacturer,
Combined Tactical Systems, provides tools for political
repression]{.mark}**]{.underline} around the globe, **[[from Ferguson,
to Palestine]{.underline}]{.mark}**, to Egypt, to Tunisia, Chile,
Bolivia, Guatemala, Thailand, and beyond. The Pennsylvania-based company
does so much business with the Israeli military, in fact, that until
several years ago they flew the Israeli flag outside their corporate
headquarters. The same weapons were being used in both Ferguson and
Gaza.38 The **[[techniques of repression circulate between the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [**[and
Israel]{.mark}**]{.underline} as easily as the physical means. Timothy
Fitch, the former police chief of St. Louis---the police department that
killed Michael Brown and placed Ferguson under siege---participated in a
weeklong training in Israel in 2011.39 Such trainings are framed as
Israeli counterterrorism experts imparting their knowledge to American
police departments so they can gain the skills to prevent terrorist
attacks. But large, [**[urban police departments]{.mark}**]{.underline}
in the United States [**[are]{.mark}**]{.underline} far [**[more likely
to test these]{.mark}**]{.underline} new skills and [**[techniques
on]{.mark}**]{.underline} poor **[[black
populations]{.underline}]{.mark} t**han so-called terrorists.40 Such
trainings are not uncommon. The Oakland Police Department, which used
tear gas and rubber bullets on Occupy protesters, had participated in a
similar Israeli training program the year before, in 2010. The New York
Police Department's Demographics Unit, which illegally spies on Arab and
Muslim New Yorkers, was modeled on Israel's practices in the West Bank.
And the Los Angeles Police Department traveled to Israel in 2013 to
learn about drones and surveillance. Not long after, Los Angeles became
the first city to apply to the Federal Aviation Administration for a
license to use drones and other forms of aerial technology for policing.
The LAPD's IT chief commented, "As civilized nations, we are all
confronted with, in many cases, the same enemy: the ever-growing threat
of terrorism and other criminal elements."41 Blackness hangs like a
shadow as we are left to wonder what these "other" criminal elements
might be. Such exchanges expose the intimate relationship between the
projection of state power inward in response to domestic unrest, and its
projection outward as warfare. This logic is also at work in civilian
culture. Take, for example, a group of Israeli students who dressed as
Ku Klux Klan members and in blackface for a mock lynching during a Purim
festival.42 The principal of their school said she saw nothing wrong
with the costumes. One might be tempted to dismiss the incident as
ignorance about the particular cultural context of lynching, but the
fact that the principle condoned this re-enactment of white supremacists
about to commit a racially motivated vigilante execution actually gives
us insight into the racial architecture of Israel as a settler society.
This event reminds us that in order **[[to enact indigenous
genocide]{.mark}]{.underline}** and displacement**[, [settler societies
have drawn upon the same language of]{.mark} [racial threat and
criminality]{.mark}]{.underline}** that has been **[[invoked to justify
anti-black violence]{.underline}]{.mark}** since the end of
Reconstruction. It is no coincidence that we often use the language of
apartheid to describe the condition of Palestinians. The authors of the
Black Solidarity Statement assert, "[**[Israel's]{.mark}**]{.underline}
widespread [**[use of]{.mark}**]{.underline} detention and
[**[imprisonment]{.mark}**]{.underline} against Palestinians [**[evokes
the mass incarceration of Black people in the US]{.mark}**,]{.underline}
including the political imprisonment of our own revolutionaries.
Soldiers, police, and courts justify lethal force against us and our
children who pose no imminent threat." It is worth noting that the
International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime
of Apartheid, adopted by the U.N. in 1973, was ratified by the majority
of its member states, with the notable exceptions of the United States
and Israel. The Convention defines apartheid as acts "committed for the
purpose of establishing and maintaining domination by one racial group
of persons over any other racial group of persons and systematically
oppressing them." Examples mentioned in the Convention include denying
others the right to move freely about, depriving them of the right to
leave and return to their country or the right to freedom of residence,
preventing mixed marriages, subjecting them to arbitrary arrests, or
expropriating property---all things Palestinians under Israeli
jurisdiction are subjected to. Israel justifies Palestinian
dispossession using the same racial ideologies all settler states draw
upon to legitimize the elimination of indigenous people. But with the
global circulation of American racism [**[after Reconstruction,
anti-blackness has become an]{.mark}**]{.underline} important [**[tool
for Israel]{.mark}**]{.underline} in ways that it was not for older
settler societies**[. [Anti-black racism is one of the ways that Israel
has produced the idea of an existential racial
threat,]{.mark}]{.underline}** whether **[[Palestinian or
otherwise]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For example, anti-African race riots
are not uncommon in Israel. In fact, Israel is actively hostile to
African Jewish migrants, sometimes going so far as to offer them the
choice of returning to Africa or being imprisoned.43 At one 2012 riot in
Tel Aviv, protestors blamed Africans for an increase in crime and
repeatedly referred to African men as rapists. One protestor carried a
sign that read, "An Israeli is attacked by an African every 7
minutes."44 The myth of the black male rapist was the primary
justification for lynching in the United States in the late nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries. So perhaps the reenactment of a lynching
by Israeli schoolchildren should not seem like it comes from a foreign
cultural context, when it in fact draws on a form of racism fundamental
to the structure of Israeli society. And finally, there is the way
Palestinian children are framed as threats both because they are, after
all, potential terrorists, and because they are a "demographic threat"
to Israel's Jewish majority through their very existence. This fear may
seem unfamiliar in a settler colonial context, which is predicated on
the erasure of the indigenous population and the fantasy that such
erasure is always already complete. The notion of a demographic threat
finds a more comfortable analogue in the post-Reconstruction United
States, when the fear of "Negro rule" justified increasing violence
against black people.

**Thus, \[Your name and your partner's name\] advocate for a decolonial
strategy that challenges the epistemological foundations of the
relationship that sustains the United States and Israel's settler
colonial regimes. Every token of support for Israel plays a part in a
global regime of genocide and brutality and reveals how settler
colonialism and anti-blackness overlap to create the judicial slaughter
of disposed communities -- understanding the two genocides as parallel
broadens the struggle for liberation. You should refuse to provide
Israel with any tools that permit the structure of violence to
continue**

The rifts between **[[Black Americans and
Palestinians]{.mark}]{.underline}** are real because of the
aforementioned prejudices, and they **[[are exacerbated by the
interlinked processes of]{.mark}]{.underline}** US support for
**[[Zionism and]{.mark}]{.underline}** other forms of
**[[militarism]{.mark}]{.underline}** and im perialism in the Middle
East. Drawing upon historical support for the Civil Rights Movement in
the United States among American Jewish individuals and communities of
conscience, support for anti-Zionist Jewish individuals and
organizations today can serve as a powerful bridge between Black, Pales
tinian, and Jewish communities. In this spirit, we are inspired by the
words of Ferrari Sheppard. Reflecting on his experience after
participating in a 2014 Black Delegation to Palestine-Israel, he writes:
\"The fact remains that our delegation was subject to a type of racism
I\'ve only experienced in the south ern states of the United States of
America\": Zionism has convinced many Jews that they are preserving
themselves. The com mon thought is that if the \"savage\" Palestinians
stop resisting, stop shooting rock ets, stop fighting Israel\'s
inevitable domination, there can be peace. I find this peculiar because
during my visit, I felt no danger from Palestinians, only from Israeli
soldiers. Perhaps it\'s because I\'m accustomed to being hunted in
America.There is no Palestinian-Israeli conflict; there is only
oppression. I will never disregard the Holocaust which left millions of
European Jews dead or scrambling for survival. There is nothing that
will ever right the wrongs committed by the brutal German regime. On the
same note, I will never minimize Germany\'s first, and little-known,
genocide against the Herero and Namaqua of Africa, or King Leopold\'s
bloody reign on the continent. Tragedy is tragedy, one should not be
placed above the other, nor should a past tragedy justify the next.
Until we embrace a notion of \"never again\" that encompasses all
people, re gardless of whom the perpetrators and victims may be,
tragedies will contin ue. **[[For every additional form of United States
support for the Israeli regime]{.mark},]{.underline}** for every Black
American soldier who harms civilians while deployed in the broader
Middle East, for every African domestic maid abused in an Arab country,
and for every Arab-American convenience store owner who exploits his
Black inner-city customers, **[[the rifts between our communities are
more pronounced]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Yet **[[they are bridged by
shared conditions of colonialism]{.mark},]{.underline}** as well as by
further potential for compassion, love, and solidarity. Palestine, the
**[[inner-city United States, Jim Crow America, and
apartheid]{.mark}]{.underline}** South Africa
**[[provide]{.mark}]{.underline}** not identical, but **[[parallel
histories]{.mark}]{.underline}** of segregation, ra cial violence, and
opportunities for connection---and friendship---between Blacks and
Arabs, queer and straight. **[[When Black Arabs become legible to us as
well]{.mark},]{.underline}** these **[[binaries]{.mark}]{.underline}**
begin to **[[collapse.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Through life
writing---namely**[, [nar ratives of]{.mark}]{.underline}**
friendship-building and **[[reciprocal solidarity]{.mark}---[the
Black]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[and/or the Arab are
humanized]{.underline}**]{.mark}---made real---and, therefore, the state
violence that be falls each is similarly evidenced as material and
illegitimate. The descendants of African slaves in the Middle East, and
other Black Arabs, including Black Palestinians, are parts of the social
fabrics of the Middle East, even as they struggle against the legacies
and contemporary realities of anti-Black color ism in the region. Even
as the Palestinian solidarity movement has been able to celebrate the
huge strides gained last year alone when professional associations in
the United States have issued various forms of endorsements for boycotts
of Israeli academic institutions complicit in Israeli apartheid and
occupation, this has catalyzed conversations and produced a range of
responses. The boycott resolutions started with the Association for
.Asian American Studies, whose action was shortly followed by solidarity
statements and resolutions support ing the boycott of Israeli academic
institutions from the Association for Hu manist Sociology, the American
Studies Association, the Native American and Indigenous Studies
Association, the Critical Ethnic Studies Association, and the African
Literature Association. Nicholas Brady, the Black American
activist-scholar from Maryland, reflecting critically on the historic
American Studies Association (ASA) resolution, has written passionately
in a blog post on what he saw as a void in the boycott debates when it
came to consider ing anti-Blackness and Black suffering in
Israel/Palestine and in the region. We understood Brady\'s intervention
as both an act of protest and a call for a form of reciprocal solidarity
in a moment when anti-blackness was seemingly under-theorized. We
believe that **[[reciprocal solidarity]{.underline}]{.mark}** along the
lines that we are delineating, and that are premised on love,
friendship, storytelling, and queer kinship, **[[can
ameliorate]{.underline}]{.mark}** the wedges between our communities
when the struggles against **[[anti-blackness or]{.mark}
[anti-Palestinianness]{.mark}]{.underline}** are not shared. At the same
time, Brady\'s intervention can be juxtaposed with the resounding
support that the Black American scholar Frederick C. **[[Moten expressed
in his reflections]{.underline}]{.mark}** on the ASA boycott resolution
well before last year, at the 2009 ASA Meeting: Selfishly, I am
interested in how **[[this boycott might provide some
experiential]{.mark}]{.underline}** and **[[theoretical resources for
the renewal of a certain affective]{.mark},]{.underline}**
extra-political **[[sociality]{.underline}]{.mark}**--- the new
international of insurgent feeling. This is to say, finally, that these
remarks have been nothing other than a long-winded preface to a
declaration of my indebted ness to Palestinians for the fact that, in
the end, the boycott might very well do more for me than it does for
you, precisely in its allowing me to be in solidarity, which is to say
consciously in a mutual indebtedness, with you and with the richness,
impossibly developed in dispossession and deprivation as payment of a
debt (or being subject to the violent imposition of a kind of credit)
that was never promised and never owed. The imposition of credit, and
its having been exceeded by an already given debt that is insofar as it
is to come, is what comprises Palestinian social life. Thanks for the
chance to join that social life, to be, as it were, pre-occupied with
it, that your call for solidarity, which is itself an act of solidarity,
provides. (\"Fred Moten\") **[[When the anti-blackwashing and
anti-pinkwashing]{.mark}]{.underline}** movements **[[work in tandem
with one another, we march one step closer]{.mark}]{.underline}** to
this **[[\"new international of insurgent
feeling]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\" Through these processes, we can and
should help amplify the voices of Black Arabs and others who are
committed to Arab-Black recip rocal solidarity. We hear these voices
when the African-American poet June Jordan writes \"I was born a Black
woman / and now / I am become a Palestinian,\" and when the
Palestinian-American poet Suheir Hammad writes \"Born Palestinian, Born
Black.\" To be sure, Jordan\'s words were the inspiration for Darnell\'s
writing of the initial draft of the delegation statement during his time
in Palestine and the very first essay he published about his visit upon
his return. Words, narratives, matter. And we read these words,
together, and we derive further strength, and further determination to
live, across our divides, together. We hear these voices through the
words of DAM, the Palestinian hip-hop group that has been inspired by
the emergence of rap as a genre first among Black Americans, which now
has transnational reverberations. DAM sees in Ameri can hip-hop not only
a musical aesthetic that resonates, but an experience underlying the
lyrics and their performance that resonates as well. Outside of the
Occupied Palestinian Territories, indigenous Palestinian Christian and
Muslim populations still reside in what has been called \"Israel
proper\"---or the \"Jewish state.\" As a marginalized and oppressed
community, **[[Palestinians in Israel can be
found]{.underline}]{.mark}** in overcrowded urban centers, segregated
from mainstream Israeli society, and **[[denied
rights]{.mark}]{.underline}** and privileges **[[because of their
ethno-religious status]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Thus, these **[[sites of
poverty, crime, under-resourced schools,]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
inferi or social services **[[constitute a political context of
racialized structural]{.mark}]{.underline}** and phys ical violence and
**[[a repressive state that mirrors what one finds in inner-city America
today]{.underline}]{.mark}** .What the Palestinian scholar Nadera
Shalhoub-Kevorkian (also a contributor to this Biography issue) has
called **[[\"criminality in spaces of death]{.mark}\"]{.underline}**
among Palestinians in East Jerusalem, for example**[, [would ring true
as well to those of us who]{.mark}]{.underline}** understand
contemporary **[[Black subjectivity in the inner-city of the United
States]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Thus, as DAM and their music proliferate
in Palestine, the broader Arab world, and across the globe, the embrace
of Black American rhythms, dress, expression, and ideology is an example
of the power ful forms of identification and solidarity that
Palestinians so clearly exhibit to ward African-Americans. And yet, many
of the localized, but **[[interconnected, struggles encountered by
African-Americans and Palestinians would]{.mark}]{.underline}**
otherwise **[[go unrealized]{.mark}]{.underline}** unless they were
evidenced. Here, again, we point to the role individuals play when
telling stories of their shared relationships to localized and global
circuits of state violence and injustice. Indeed, within our friendship
we discovered connections that are often misrepresented or muted within
anti Black and anti-Palestinian discourses that seek to disempower
movements by splintering the very bodies impacted by such discourses.
The work of reciprocal solidarity between Black Americans and Pales
tinians also requires self-reflexivity on the part of those who choose
to be in community. The renowned Palestinian-American writer Susan
Abulhawa has called for \"confronting anti-black racism in the Arab
world\" in a widely-read article that historicizes and contextualizes
this racism and which was pub lished in AlJazeera (\"Confronting\").
Abulhawa also calls for \"reciprocal hu man solidarity\" in a piece
published in Electronic Intifada, a pro-Palestinian website
(\"Palestinian\"). The editors of the site later imposed on Abulhawa\'s
article the title \"The Palestinian struggle is a black struggle,\" and
then refused to honor Abulhawa\'s request that they change that title or
at the very least add a disclaimer that the author did not approve of
it. As a result, she posted the following in the Comments section
beneath the article: I need to make it clear here that I, the author of
this essay, did not choose the tide. I\'ve asked EI to make that
disclaimer to the essay, but they refused, saying that their guidelines
are clear that they retain the right to choose whatever title they like,
ap parently even if that title does not accurately reflect the author\'s
words. Given this, I need to make it clear here (and hope the moderators
will have the integrity to allow this post) that I was careful, in
fact**[, [NOT to say that the Palestinian struggle was a Black
struggle]{.mark}]{.underline}** because I think there is an element of
ap propriation of someone else\'s struggle to this statement. I referred
to the \"essential blackness\" of our struggle and said that our
struggle was \"spiritually and politically black\" but never that it was
a black struggle. There\'s a difference and I just need to put that out
there. It is unfortunate that the editors at EI would choose to
interpret my words and then disregard my objection to attributing those
words to me. This case demonstrates an example of anti-solidarity
vis-à-vis Black Ameri cans within the Palestinian solidarity movement on
the part of Electronic In tifada. It also **[[highlights the importance
of remaining vigilant]{.mark}]{.underline}** when it comes to **[[the
appropriation of another community\'s struggle]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
the name of reciprocal solidarity. Life writing, as well as other forms
of biographical narration, centers on the life worlds, subjectivities,
and inner lives of human bodies. Life writing inevitably privileges the
inner life of the subject, and as such, dimin ishes the possibility of
misappropriating one another\'s narrative and struggles.

#### Decolonization is the only way to truly end settler colonialism - only a commitment to Indigenous sovereignty is capable of rupturing legal institutions responsible for Palestinian oppression.

[**[There are]{.mark}**]{.underline} only a **[[few ways to end settler
colonialism]{.underline}. [The settlers might]{.underline}]{.mark}**
physically [**[leave]{.mark}**,]{.underline} thus returning the country
back to its native inhabitants. **[[This happened
in]{.underline}]{.mark}** situations where reconciliation proved
impossible and settler domination became unsustainable: the British in
Ireland, Kenya and Rhodesia; the French in
**[[Algeria]{.underline}]{.mark}**; the Portuguese in **[[Angola and
Mozambique]{.underline}]{.mark}**; the South Africans in Namibia.
Alternatively, the settlers succeed in either eliminating the indigenous
population, as the Spanish did in Argentina, or in reducing it to a
marginal position within the independent settler policy, as in Brazil,
Mexico and much of Latin America, the US, Canada, Australia and New
Zealand. [**[The settlers may]{.mark}**]{.underline} also [**[succeed in
establishing]{.mark}**]{.underline} an independent [**[policy but unable
to]{.mark}**]{.underline} decisively [**[defeat the
natives]{.mark}**,]{.underline} who remain but constitute a
destabilizing population, thus [[l**eaving open the possibility of
ending settler dominance**]{.mark}**. [Israeli settler colonialism over
Palestine is a prime example]{.mark}**]{.underline} of this dilemma, as
was South Africa before the end of apartheid and Northern Ireland until
the end of The Troubles (which still needs resolution). In the case of
Israel and the Palestinians**[, [only a successful process of
decolonization]{.mark}]{.underline}** and indigenous/settler
reconciliation **[[can bring an end to "the
conflict"]{.underline}]{.mark}** (a term the Palestinian reject since it
implies a contest between two warring "sides" rather than the unilateral
imposition of a repressive settler regime). [**[The history of the
"peace process"]{.mark}**]{.underline} over the past half-century
[**[has been]{.mark}**]{.underline} one that has been [**[restricted to
finding some pragmatic formula]{.mark}**,]{.underline} a workable
compromise. The Palestinians, in their political weakness, have played
along with this. For the past 30 years an extremely "generous offer\`'
to the Israelis has been on the table: we, the indigenous population,
will not only recognize your sovereignty over 78 percent of our historic
homeland, we will also normalize relations with you and ensure that the
wider Muslim world does so as well. But **[[by submitting to a "peace
process" based on]{.mark} [power negotiations rather
than]{.mark}]{.underline}** on international law, human rights, justice
or **[[decolonization,]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[Palestinians have
had to accept]{.mark}]{.underline}** ever more outrageous "compromises"
up to submitting to [**[an apartheid regime]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Such
a process has encouraged Israel to see accommodation with the
Palestinians as a zero-sum, win/lose proposition, one which Israel
believes it has won. [**[Only a]{.mark}**]{.underline} justice-and-peace
[**[process based on decolonization defines a political settlement in
terms that]{.mark} [address the deeper issues]{.mark}**]{.underline}
involved, and thus lends the claims of the weaker indigenous greater
moral weight as well as equal political weight and visibility.
**[[What]{.underline}]{.mark}**, then, **[[would]{.underline}]{.mark}**
the true **[[decolonization]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Palestine
[**[entail]{.underline}**?]{.mark} What would have to be done for an
indigenous/settler accommodation, if not reconciliation, to be realized?
[[**The "settler contract**,"]{.mark}]{.underline} by which the settlers
agreed among themselves that they are entitled to colonize the country,
**[[must be undone. This opens]{.mark} a [space in
which]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}they can make the necessary
gesture of greatest peril to them: **[[acknowledging the sovereign
presence of]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[indigenous
people]{.underline}]{.mark}** and their right to self-determination. It
**[[is this act that makes the constitutional "deal"
possible]{.underline}]{.mark}**: settler legitimacy in return for native
rights; **[[The right of Palestinian refugees to return
to]{.underline}]{.mark}** their country and, to the degree that it is
possible, to the [**[places from where they were
expelled]{.underline}**,]{.mark} must be implemented. Refugees -- the
internally displaced as well as those exiled -- must rebuild their
personal lives and to be fully reintegrated into the country's society,
economy and polity. A democratic regime must be instituted where common
citizenship, equal civil rights, restorative justice and respect for
collective forms of cultural and religious association combine with
acknowledgement of past colonial crimes and, in a concession to the
settlers, a process of reconciliation. [**[The native must be "written
back in]{.underline}**."]{.mark}The "narrative gap" in which the
indigenous story now was unknown, unacknowledged, counter-intuitive,
threatening, repressed and resisted by the dominant settler population
must be filled. **[[That "gap" rendered the indigenous anti-colonial
struggle invisible,]{.underline}]{.mark}** concealing and denying the
fact of settler colonialism itself. While parts of **[[the settler
narrative]{.underline}]{.mark}** may be integrated into a new
representative one, some of its basic elements -- **[[that of settlers
coming to an]{.mark} [empty]{.mark},]{.underline}** barren
**[[land]{.underline}]{.mark}** devoid of history, of violent,
unentitled, primitive indigenous people versus peaceful "civilized"
settlers, and in this case of de-judaizing the national narrative --
**[[must be superseded;]{.underline}]{.mark}** and **[[The structures
and mechanisms of domination]{.underline}]{.mark}** (de-judaization)
**[[must be dismantled, in particular of]{.mark} [population management,
land management, military and security controls, the management of
legitimacy and a decolonization of the mind]{.mark}]{.underline}** --
settler and colonized alike.

This special issue of settler colonial studies emerges out of a March
2011 conference on settler colonialism in Palestine organised by the
Palestine Society and the London Middle East Institute at the School of
Oriental and African Studies. It is our hope that this issue will
catalyse creative, collaborative work that puts the settler colonial
framework firmly on the agenda of Palestine studies. [The need for such
engagement arises from our recognition that while [Zionism and the
Palestinians are]{.mark} gradually [being included in]{.mark} the
growing body of scholarly [works on]{.mark} comparative [settler
colonialism]{.mark}, the analytical framework that comparative [settler
colonialism offers]{.mark} has yet to enter the field of Palestine
studies]{.underline}.1 From the earliest Palestinian accounts to the
vast majority of contemporary research, [[the crimes committed against
Palestinian society]{.underline}]{.mark} by the Zionist movement and the
state it built [have been well recorded. [Zionism is
a]{.mark}]{.underline}n ideology and a political movement that subjects
Palestine and Palestinians to [[structural]{.mark} and violent
form]{.underline}s [of [dispossession]{.mark}, land appropriation, [and
erasure]{.mark} in the pursuit of a new Jewish state and
society]{.underline}. As for other settler colonial movements, for
Zionism, the control of land is a zero-sum contest fought against the
indigenous population. [The drive [to control the maximum amount of
land]{.mark} is at its centre]{.underline}. The continued existence of
Palestinians, therefore, poses severe problems for the completion of the
Zionist project, and, consequently, informs Israeli state policies
against Palestinians inside Israel, in the Occupied Territories, and in
exile. Consequently, transfer -- a Zionist euphemism for the
coordinated, at times randomly applied, plethora of legal, military, and
economic tactics to expel Palestinians -- has been part of Israeli
policy and public discourse since the creation of the state.2 As Israeli
historian and neoconservative Benny Morris remarked, 'had \[David Ben
Gurion\] carried out full expulsion -- rather than partial -- he would
have stabilized the State of Israel for generations'. 3 Yet, plagued by
'instability', [the settler colonial structure undergirding Israeli
practices takes on a painful array of manifestations]{.underline}:
aerial and maritime bombardment, massacre and invasion, home
demolitions, land theft, identity card confiscation, racist laws and
loyalty tests, the wall, the siege on Gaza, cultural appropriation,
dependence on willing (or unwilling) native collaboration regarding
security arrangements, [[all with the]{.mark} continued [support]{.mark}
and backing [of imperial powers]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the absence of
a cohesive framework, scholarship often appears to catalogue Zionist
practices and offences against Palestinians as a series of distinct --
yet related -- events. The Palestinian nation is pushed from one
catastrophe to another as the Zionist project accelerates. However,
[viewed through the lens of [settler colonialism]{.mark}, the Nakba in
1948 is not simply a precondition for the creation of Israel or the
outcome of early Zionist ambitions; the Nakba [is not a singular event
but]{.mark} is manifested today in [the continuing subjection of
Palestinians by Israelis]{.mark}]{.underline}. In order to move forward
and create a transformative, liberatory research agenda, [[it is
necessary to analyse Zionism's structural continuities and]{.mark} the
[ideology]{.mark} that informs Israeli policies and practices in Israel
and toward Palestinians everywhere]{.underline}. In other words, while
Israel's tactics have often been described as settler colonial, [[the
settler colonial structure]{.mark} underpinning them [must be a central
object]{.mark} of analysis]{.underline}.4 By bringing together scholars
of both comparative settler colonialism and Palestine studies, this
special issue intends to further a nascent conversation, and hopes to
provide a spark for future crossdisciplinary research that contributes
to both fields. Despite the endurance of Israeli settler colonialism,
[settler [colonial analysis ha]{.mark}s largely [fallen into disuse in
Palestine studies]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a framework, settler
colonialism once served as a primary ideological and political
touchstone for the Palestinian national movement, and informed the
intellectual work of many committed activists and revolutionary
scholars, whether Palestinians, Israelis, or allies.5 Today, [research
tends to focus on Palestine as an exceptional case, constituted in local
contexts, in particular the West Bank. But these problems are far from
simply the result of shifts in academic knowledge and practice: the
Palestinian liberation movement has seen a series of
ruptures]{.underline} and changes in emphasis, and in many ways
scholarly production accurately mirrors the dynamics of incoherent
contemporary Palestinian politics. Recent Palestinian political history
has been a long march away from a liberation agenda and towards a
piecemeal approach to the establishment of some kind of sovereignty
under the structure of the Israeli settler colonial regime. In this
environment, it is not surprising that [even [scholarship]{.mark}
written in solidarity with Palestinians [tends to shy away from
structural questions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Much of the contemporary
literature tends to take on micro-political issues or Israeli
administrative practices within a given context and prodigiously
overwork them. But [when did Palestinians ever find themselves in a
'post-colonial' condition? When did the ongoing struggle over land and
for return become a 'postconflict' situation?]{.underline} When did
Israel become a 'post-Zionist' society? When did indigenous Palestinians
in the Galilee (for example) become an 'ethnic minority'? And when did
the establishment of the Palestinian Authority and the consequent
fortification of Palestinian reserves become 'state-building'? Moreover,
[[the trend towards]{.mark} studying [the occupation]{.mark} often
[internalises it as]{.mark} an [ontological]{.mark} category [distinct
from]{.mark} the larger [structures of]{.mark} Israeli [settler
colonialism. The occupation imposes boundaries]{.mark} on space and
time; and categories, discourses, and materialities that are [embedded
in colonial power relations]{.mark} are operationalised in this
literature]{.underline}. The Green Line, the border between Israel and
the Palestinian reserves, is one example of this phenomenon: it has
become a powerful symbolic and material signifier that enforces, and
takes for granted, the fragmentation of the Palestinian polity. With few
exceptions, it is a line that is rarely crossed in scholarly accounts of
Palestine -- in either direction. Different [Palestinian populations
have come to be represented as isolated, analytically separate, pieces
of an impossible puzzle.]{.underline} In addition, the focus on the
second stage of colonisation, the 1967 occupation, emphasises settlement
by Israelis in the West Bank and absolves previous generations of
Zionists and Israel itself of settler colonialism. '[For
[natives']{.mark}]{.underline}, as Patrick Wolfe puts it, ['the issue is
that, at the hands of the settlers, they [face \[physical and symbolic\]
elimination']{.mark}]{.underline}. 6 Given such a threat, the central
question for committed scholarship and liberatory movements should be
how to develop a praxis that brings back decolonisation and liberation
as the imperative goal. The advantage of [advancing [settler
colonialism]{.mark} as [a relevant interpretative framework for the
study of Zionism]{.mark}]{.underline} is not only that it [can offer
conceptual and political possibilities for how we read Palestine
today]{.underline}, but [that [it also dismantles]{.mark} deep-seeded
analyses and [assumptions]{.mark} sustaining claims [of
exceptionalism]{.mark}. It [brings Israel into comparison
with]{.mark}]{.underline} cases such as South Africa, Rhodesia and
French-Algeria, and earlier [[settler colonial formations such as
the]{.mark} [United States]{.mark}]{.underline}, Canada or Australia,
rather than the contemporary European democracies [to which Israel seeks
comparison.]{.underline} For Palestine, it means the reiteration of the
fact that Palestinians are an indigenous people, and an alignment of
Palestine scholarship with indigenous and native studies. In this
context, John Collins notes, the challenge is to bring all the relevant
tools of critically engaged scholarship \[...\] in order to pursue two
related objectives: to understand the complex set of structures and
processes \[...\] that have combined to produce the intolerable reality
evident today; and to think creatively about how this understanding
might enable individuals to transform that reality. 7 Otherwise, settler
colonialism remains a descriptive category that does not move beyond
sentiment and into strategy. While activists, both in Palestine and
outside it, continue to push back against Zionist encroachment,
intensify the demand for equal rights, and build a boycott, [divestment
and sanctions movement aimed at shaming and delegitimising Israel
internationally, the creative offerings of the settler colonial studies
paradigm remain underutilised]{.underline}. This lack of rigorous
engagement has consequences for movement building. [The historic
response to settler colonialism has been]{.underline} the struggle for
[decolonisation; [in the absence of a settler colonial analysis,
Palestinian strategies have tended to target]{.mark} or accommodate
settler colonial [outcomes rather than]{.mark} aiming [to
decolonise]{.mark} the structure]{.underline} itself. Equally important,
[[the analysis]{.mark} enabled [by]{.mark} the [settler colonial]{.mark}
paradigm [offers a powerful political tool]{.mark} to
reorient]{.underline} and recreate genuine bi-directional solidarity
[alliances]{.underline} and political fraternity. As attested by the
cover of this issue, a declaration of solidarity for Palestinians in
their struggle against Zionist aggression by the Organization of
Solidarity for the People of Asia, Africa and Latin America (OSPAAAL),
this convergence is not new. [The settler colonial perspective offers
the possibility of a new in-gathering of movements]{.underline},
harnessing each other's strengths for an active, mutual, and principled
Palestinian alignment with the Arab struggle for selfdetermination, and
indigenous struggles in North America, Latin America, Oceania, and
elsewhere. Such an alignment would expand the tools available to
Palestinians and their solidarity movement, and reconnect the struggle
to its own history of anti-colonial internationalism. At its core, [this
internationalist approach asserts that the [Palestinian struggle
against]{.mark} Zionist [settler colonialism can only be won when it
is]{.mark} embedded within, and [empowered by, broader struggles]{.mark}
-- all anti-imperial, all anti-racist, and all struggling to make
another world possible]{.underline}. The issue opens with Zachary
Lockman's critical and constructive engagement with Gershon Shafir's
landmark study on the formative period of the Zionist labour movement
and its colonisation strategy (Land, Labor and the Origins of the
IsraeliPalestinian Conflict, 1882-1914). Lockman presents an alternative
historical narrative of the evolution of the Zionist labour movement,
and highlights the coercive power employed by the British colonial state
in Palestine against Palestinian Arabs. Ilan Pappé's article meditates
on the complications of applying the framework of comparative settler
colonialism -- which is largely based on historical case studies -- to
the specific case of [Israeli settler colonialism]{.underline}, a
project that [is still expanding its frontiers]{.underline}. David
Lloyd's paper engages with the work of Giorgio Agamben on the state of
exception and deals with the following question: to what extent can the
Palestinian situation be understood as unique? These pieces are followed
by two case studies from Palestine, one by Mansour Nasasra highlighting
the case of the Zionist expulsions and village destructions in the
Naqab, the other by Magid Shihade on the practices employed by the state
in fragmenting and dissolving Palestinian social identities. Shir
Hever's article discusses Israel's approaches towards indigenous labour
and the indigenous economy. In [[comparing]{.mark} the Zionist
[colonisation of Palestine with]{.mark} the cases of]{.underline}
Australia and [[the United States]{.underline}]{.mark}, Patrick Wolfe
points to the historical and material conditions that underpin this
project. Wolfe argues that, contrary to common assumptions, [Zionism
constitutes an intensification of, rather than a departure from, settler
colonialism]{.underline}. The last feature article is by indigenous
scholar and activist Waziyatawin, who recently visited Palestine as part
of a delegation of feminist women of colour. Here she discusses some of
the lessons Palestine afforded her regarding indigenous resistance and
struggles for sovereignty. We also offer excerpts from two historical
documents outlining the long struggle for Palestinian liberation. They
highlight some of the ways in which settler colonialism as a paradigm
has historically been used in work on Palestine. An excerpt taken from
Palestinian trade unionist George Mansour's The Arab worker under the
Palestine mandate (1937) opens the section. Mansour provides a clear
picture of the dire socio-economic consequences that Zionist
colonisation, and British support for it, had on Palestinian indigenous
workers and Palestinian society as a whole. Along these lines, he
exposes the Histadrut's 'conquest of labour' strategy and refutes
British claims about the positive impact Britain's support for a
national Jewish home had on indigenous Palestinian society. This is
followed by an excerpt taken from Palestinian intellectual and political
activist Fayez A. Sayegh's Zionist colonialism in Palestine (1965).
Sayegh's description of the structural features underpinning Zionist
colonisation -- and the consequences for the Palestinian nation -- is
arguably one of the clearest and most potent analyses of its generation.
Finally, hoping to expand the conversation on settler colonialism within
Palestine studies, we offer the Arabic translation of Patrick Wolfe's
seminal essay, 'Settler Colonialism and the Elimination of the Native'.
This is a foundational text for comparative settler colonial studies,
and we hope that it will speak to Arab scholars and activists alike.

primed]{.mark}]{.underline}**, for generations, [**[by]{.mark} our own
national narrative of manifest destiny, [white supremacy]{.mark}** and
exceptionalism]{.underline}. We all are well versed with language about
[the "special relationship" between Israel and the United
States]{.underline}. And in fact, it [is real]{.underline}. Over time,
[[no other country in the world has been the recipient of
more]{.underline}]{.mark} economic and [[military aid from the
U.S]{.mark}., or from any other country for that matter]{.underline}.
Furthermore, many of us hold **[a power analysis which says that [the
key to ending Israel's ongoing occupation]{.mark} and oppression [of
Palestinians is ending that unconditional special
relationship]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- so understanding the roots of
this relationship is not idle curiosity. It's essential if we are to
ever achieve a just and durable peace, for both peoples. [There are many
reasons for this so-called special relationship,]{.underline} and it has
evolved over time, but I think the foundational aspects of it relate to
remarkably similar national narratives which shape, in an ongoing way,
[how we see and understand ourselves and our actions as representatives
of a collective national identity--- how we justify killing, extraction,
land theft, and so on, in transcendent moral terms.]{.underline} **[[We
have mythical national narratives of two settler colonial peoples,
who]{.underline}]{.mark} both [[believe that we have a divine
mandate]{.mark}, [to settle a]{.mark} so-called empty or [savage
land]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and make it into a kind of heaven on
earth[. [Ethnic cleansing,]{.mark} even [genocide---]{.mark}these [are
all divinely justified]{.mark}]{.underline}. Israel is to be a light
unto nations. What would become the United States, a kind of heaven on
earth. Both peoples believe ourselves to be somehow specially chosen by
God. As Donald E. Pease, Dartmouth literary critic wrote about this
land, in The New American Exceptionalism: "Virgin Land" depopulated the
landscape in the imaginary register so that it might be perceived as
unoccupied territory in actuality. The metaphor turned the landscape
into a blank page, understood to be the ideal surface onto which to
inscribe the history of the nation's Manifest Destiny". "Virgin Land
narratives placed the movement of the national people across the
continent in opposition to the savagery attributed to the wilderness as
well as the native peoples who figured as indistinguishable from the
wilderness, and, later, it fostered an understanding of the campaign of
Indian removal as nature's beneficent choice of the Anglo-American
settlers over the native inhabitants for its cultivation..." Sounds
familiar doesn't it? [[The Zionist]{.mark} version is the [famous
slogan]{.mark}]{.underline}--- a [**[Land with No People for a People
with No Land]{.mark}**.]{.underline} And [[Israel's "miraculous"
military]{.mark} victories have always been [seen as signs of God the
adjudicator's hand.]{.mark}]{.underline} Of course, [that notion of
heaven on earth, or A Light Unto Nations, is predicated on a system of
racial and ethnic superiority]{.underline}---[who gets to be human and
"civilized", and who is subhuman.]{.underline} Who exists, and who is
invisible or must be disappeared. [Who can claim the land, and who has
no rights to it]{.underline}. And **[[the fundamental root of]{.mark}
all [that we like to call the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict]{.mark} [is
this essential fact]{.mark} -- [it was a land with
people]{.mark}.]{.underline}** And specifically, the wrong [people who
by definition could not be part of an ethnic exclusivist
state.]{.underline} Remember that the original violence of the Nakba,
the ethnic cleansing of the land of Palestinians, continues on a daily
basis to this day. [**[The process of colonization never
stopped]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Although today we call them "facts on
the ground", and Palestinians are talked about, not as equal human
beings with the same hopes aspirations and rights to freedom, but rather
as a "demographic threat."

#### There is a Special Relationship between Israel and the U.S. \-\-\--Trump relationship with Israel is a violation of law based on sales of weapons used against Palestine

[[The US military]{.mark} industry\'s [profits from the colonization of
Palestinian]{.mark} land is a long-term structuring element of the
US-Israel special relationship]{.underline}, Anna Badillo argues. In the
wake of U.S. President Donald Trump's
[recognition](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-trump-signs-order-recognizing-golan-heights-as-israeli-territory-1.7058996)
of Israeli sovereignty over the Syrian Golan Heights, [we are seeing a
continuation of the [Trump]{.mark}'s administration's flat-out
[rejection of [international
law](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/palestinians-speak-anniversary-resolution-242-171117092925628.html)]{.mark}
on the status of occupied territories held by Israel]{.underline} since
1967. The timing is significant because [it [is an attempt]{.mark} by
Trump [to meddle in the Israeli elections]{.mark} on April 9 which
ultimately could benefit Benjamin Netanyahu's chances for re-election.
[The Trump administration]{.mark} seems to care very little about
international consensus and international law on the status of the
occupied territories. Instead, it [has sabotaged the American
government's standing]{.mark} as an "honest broker" [and]{.mark}
effectively [encouraged]{.mark} support for the continuation of [Israeli
colonization of Arab land.]{.mark}]{.underline} Until now, no country
had recognized Israel's act of
[plunder](https://mondoweiss.net/2019/03/trumps-israels-annexation/?fbclid=IwAR1miMZBomQuchdjmzybvIjy8bdlSu8wcryLYQ918S7ZLwJXFYP7xr1YnGA)
in the Golan Heights. Following the Six Day war in 1967, Israel expelled
130,000 Syrians from the Golan Heights. 14 years later, in 1981, Israel
annexed the territory -- in violation of international law. The United
Nations member states, including the U.S., immediately
[declared](https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/03/1035631) Israeli efforts
to change the Golan Height's status "null and void." A small population
of Syrian Druze are the only survivors of that ethnic cleansing
operation. Greg Shupak, author of The Wrong Story: Palestine, Israel and
the Media,
[argues](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20180528-the-wrong-story-palestine-israel-and-the-media/)
that "[[American]{.mark} foreign [policy and Israeli settler-colonial
capitalism shape]{.mark} what happens across historic
[Palestine]{.mark}."]{.underline} We recently saw this unfold when
[[Trump issued his [Jerusalem
decree](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/world/middleeast/trump-jerusalem-israel-capital.html)]{.mark}
to recognize the city as the Israeli capital, which goes [against the
international community's consensus]{.mark}]{.underline} of Jerusalem as
a final status issue in negotiations and, again[, [violates
international
law](http://studies.aljazeera.net/en/positionpapers/2017/12/trumps-recognition-jerusalem-israels-capital-background-ramifications-171225072045602.html)]{.underline}.
While the U.S. Embassy was moving from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem on May 15,
[Israeli snipers were massacring 60 Palestinians
protesters](https://thedefensepost.com/2018/05/14/israeli-forces-kill-protesting-palestinians-in-gaza-as-us-opens-embassy-in-jerusalem/)
in the Great March of Return at the Gaza fence. This is not the first
time we have seen U.S. foreign policy and Israeli settler-colonial
enterprise interfered with the international community's consensus on
Palestinian-Israeli affairs. The [Jerusalem Basic Law of
1980](https://www.adalah.org/en/law/view/520) and the [Jerusalem Embassy
Act of 1995](http://time.com/5049019/jerusalem-embassy-history/) were
highly controversial because of their timing and their political and
legal implications, according to [Michael
Zank](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/629170/summary), a professor at
Boston University. Both laws were enacted during times when the
international coalition was making progress with the Palestinian-Israeli
peace negotiations. U.S. President Jimmy Carter and Egyptian President
Anwar al-Sadat had signed the Camp David Accords, a peace treaty with
Israel and Egypt in 1979; consequently, the Jerusalem Basic Law
endangered the peace process and negatively impacted the ongoing
negotiations. [The Jerusalem Embassy Act was signed into law shortly
after the Oslo Accords were concluded and greatly affected the final
status negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian
Authority]{.underline} that were held at Camp David in 2000. Both these
legislative acts created a binding relationship between Israel and the
U.S which ultimately changed the status quo. But to fully conceptualize
the U.S.-Israel special relationship we need to unpack the [[the]{.mark}
preferential [arms trade agreements]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[allows
for this relationship to continue at the expense of the indigenous
population]{.mark} in the occupied territories.]{.underline} Max Ajl, a
PhD candidate in development sociology at Cornell University,
[writes](http://inthesetimes.com/article/19479/the-israeli-aid-package-10-more-years-of-the-special-relationship)[:
"U.S. '[military assistance]{.mark},' more accurately understood as [a
circular flow]{.mark} through which U.[S. weapons firms profit off the
colonization of Palestinian land and Israeli destabilization]{.mark} of
the surrounding states, is a long-term structuring element of the
U.S.-Israel 'special relationship.'"]{.underline} U.S. military
[loans](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/history-and-overview-of-u-s-foreign-aid-to-israel)
started arriving in Israel in November 1971, when the Nixon
administration signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Israel to build
up its domestic industrial-arms sector through technical and
manufacturing assistance. Grants started to replace loans in 1974. [The
U.S. government shortly afterwards started to permit Israel to spend 26%
of the annual military grant]{.underline} on purchases in Israel -- a
unique arrangement, since [by U.S. law recipient countries must spend
all of their foreign military financing in the U.S.]{.underline}
According to Ajl, "[the Israeli military industry often relies on U.S.
technological inputs, and the U.S. forbids Israel from manufacturing
crucial heavy weaponry, such as fighter jets, in order to maintain
control over Israel."]{.underline} U.S. military grants to Israel were
often quid pro quo, as [[Israel]{.mark} increasingly [took on the
work]{.mark} for which [the U.S. could not]{.mark} publicly take
responsibility, given popular unease in the States over aid to fascist
dictatorships.]{.underline} As the International Jewish Anti-Zionist
Network noted in their
[report](http://www.ebony.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/israels-worldwide-role-in-repression-footnotes-finalized.pdf),
Israel's Worldwide Role in Repression, in the 1970s, Israel armed the
brutal military regime of the Argentinian junta that imposed seven years
of state terrorism on the population. Israel also provided most of the
arms that Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio "Tachito" Somoza used in the
last year of his dictatorship to oppose the revolution, a conflict that
killed tens of thousands of Nicaraguans in the 1970s. By the 2000s, [the
Israeli military-industrial complex had produced an industry capable of
competing in small-arms and high-end security technology on a worldwide
scale. [Israel started to export arms that have been refined
through]{.mark} high-technology [colonial policing of the Palestinian
population]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially in the Gaza Strip and the
West Bank. In recent years, Israel has risen to one of the [top 10 arms
exporters](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5174345,00.html)
in the world. Last May Haaretz
[reported](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/israel-s-defense-export-sales-exceed-record-9-billion-1.6052046),
"Israel's defense-related exports in 2017 totalled \$9.2 billion, an
all-time record and whooping 40% increase over 2016 -- when
defense-related transactions totaled \$6.5 billion." The Obama
administration adjustments to [Israel's military aid
package](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-israel-statement/u-s-israel-sign-38-billion-military-aid-package-idUSKCN11K2CI)
came amidst a shifting geopolitical environment, both within the U.S.
and Israel. There was a shift in original MOU that would slowly phase
out the provisions through which Israel could spend up to 26% of its
funding package within Israel, to Israel spending more of this funding
on the advanced military capabilities that only the United States can
provide -- as much as \$1.2 billion per year, according to Ajl. In
addition, this MOU locked in \$500 million annually for missile
defense.[The MOU mandates Israel update its fighter aircraft fleet,
which is a direct
[investment](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lockheed-martin-lands-23-billion-pentagon-contract-1542237634)
into the U.S. military-industrial complex]{.underline}, given that
fighter-jet factories are exclusively based in the United States. Not
only does [U[.S. foreign policy and Israeli-settler colonialism
shape]{.underline}]{.mark} [what happens across historic
[Palestine]{.mark}, it also shapes what happens [across the Middle
East]{.mark} region. The firm establishment of Israel's military defense
industry also provides an excuse to sell ever-more-sophisticated weapons
to other regional U.S. allies, especially Saudi Arabia. As long as
[Israel has the latest U.S.
technology](https://thedefensepost.com/2019/03/04/us-eucom-deploys-thaad-israel/)]{.underline},
other countries can buy older models, [again to the great profit of the
U.S. defense industry. [Israel]{.mark} thus [is the spark plug for an
entire region-wide weapons bazaar]{.mark}]{.underline}, while also
[providing such countries the means to destroy and dismantle even poorer
countries like Yemen.]{.underline} [[This keeps the]{.mark} entire
[region aflame]{.mark}]{.underline}, oppressed and desperate, and [thus
unlikely to upset hierarchical regional and international social
structures]{.underline}. Ajl suggests that one of reasons the United
States pushed through this MOU before Obama left office is the rising
discontent within the U.S. population over ongoing support for Israeli
colonization of historic Palestine and the surrounding region. Frida
Berrigan, author of Made in the U.S.A.: American Military Aid to Israel,
[writes](http://www.defense-aerospace.com/article-view/feature/71588/focus%3A-u.s.-aid,-companies-fuel-israeli-military.html)
that [a major barrier to any shift in American policy towards
Palestine-Israel is "financial pressures from a U.S military industrial
complex accustomed to billions of dollars in sales to Israel and other
Middle Eastern nations locked in a seemingly perpetual arms race with
each other by all buying American and using Foreign Military Financing
(FMF) to pay the bills." [The United States is the]{.mark} primary
[source of Israel's]{.mark} far superior [arsenal]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Israel's
[dependence](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2018/03/understanding-military-aid-israel-180305092533077.html)
on the U.S. for aid and arms means that [the Israeli military relies on
spare parts and technical assistance from the U.S. to maintain optimum
performance in battle.]{.underline} During the Bush administration, from
2001 to 2005, Israel had actually received more in U.S. military aid
than it has in U.S. arms deliveries. Over this time period, Israel
received \$10.5 billion in FMF -- the Pentagon's biggest military aid
program -- and \$6.3 billion in U.S. arms deliveries. According to
Berrigan, the most prominent of those deals was a \$4.5 billion sale of
102 Lockheed Martin F-16s to Israel. Unlike other countries, Israel
[receives](https://www.mepc.org/node/4789) its Economic Support Funds in
one lump sum early in the fiscal year rather than in four quarterly
installments. While other countries primarily deal with the Department
of Defense when arranging to purchase military hardware from U.S.
companies, Israel deals directly with U.S. companies for the vast
majority of its military purchases in the United States. Other countries
have a \$100,000 minimum purchase amount per contract, but Israel is
allowed to purchase military items for far less, according to Berrigan.
Today, Israel has been the beneficiary of approximately \$125 billion in
U.S. aid. An unimaginable sum, more than any other country since World
War II. U.S. aid is projected to further increase to \$165 billion by
the end of the new 10-year package, in 2029, according to [Charles D.
Freilich](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/israels-dependence-united-states-existential),
a former Israeli deputy national security adviser. U.S. aid constitutes
some 3% of Israel's total state budget and about 1% of its GDP, a highly
significant sum. Moreover, U.S. aid constitutes some 20% of the total
defense budget, 40% of the budget of the Israel Defense Forces, and
almost the entire procurement budget, according to Freilich. [Israel's
dependence on the U.S. is not limited to financial aid and weapons
sales]{.underline}. According to Freilich, [the U.S. provides
technologies for the development of unique weapons systems that Israel
needs, such as the Iron Dome and the Arrow rocket and missile defense
systems]{.underline}. It mans the radar deployed in Israel, which is
linked to the global American satellite system. Fredilich writes, "There
is simply no alternative to American weapons, and our dependence on the
United States is almost complete; the bitter truth is that without the
United States, the IDF would be an empty shell." The United States is
Israel's largest trading partner, at least partially due to their
[bilateral free trade
agreement](https://thedefensepost.com/2019/04/08/libya-haftar-fighting-tripoli-africom-relocates-forces/),
the first the United States signed with any country. [[The U.S.-Israel
special relationship is rooted in]{.mark} preferential [arms trade
agreements as a way to subsidize the U.S. military]{.mark} industry [and
reinforce support for Israeli colonialism]{.mark}. This special
relationship is locked into an arms trade cycle where both [the Israeli
and American elite class benefits, at the expense of the indigenous
population]{.mark}.]{.underline} The U.S. recognition of Israeli
sovereignty over occupied territories provides a boost for Israeli
colonialism. We must ask ourselves, "If Trump has consented to Israeli
illegal seizure of the Golan Heights and Jerusalem, why not also the
West Bank?" Prime Minister Netanyahu has
[vowed](https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710799152/ahead-of-israeli-election-netanyahu-pledges-to-annex-west-bank-settlements?fbclid=IwAR1azyLYA6DS-SNI7sPhcfBQJdm9kmJDJZQzctIbxMg0ivmCsCbjIjZGsl0)
to annex Israeli settlements in the West Bank if he is re-elected, which
will likely be considered as the final blow to the so called possibility
of a two-state solution. The Trump administration is expected to
announce his ["ultimate
deal"](https://www.timesofisrael.com/snap-elections-may-put-trumps-peace-plan-on-back-burner-until-summer/)
following the Israeli elections and after a new government is formed.
[It is only a matter of time till the Trump administration decides to
follow suit and
[recognize](https://www.ft.com/content/f95fb59a-4ca1-11e9-bbc9-6917dce3dc62)Israeli
sovereignty over the West Bank, which will drive the final nail into the
coffin of the Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations and solidify
Israeli apartheid]{.underline}

#### The united states are investing billions of dollars toward Israel

It includes a review of past aid programs, data on annual assistance,
and analysis of current issues. For general information on Israel, see
CRS Report RL33476, Israel: Background and U.S. Relations, by Jim
Zanotti. Israel is the largest cumulative recipient of U.S. foreign
assistance since World War II. To date, [the United States has provided
Israel \$134.7 billion]{.underline} (current, or noninflation-adjusted,
dollars) [in bilateral assistance and missile defense
funding.]{.underline} [Almost all U.S. bilateral aid to Israel is in the
form of military assistance, although in the past Israel also received
significant economic assistance]{.underline}. At a signing ceremony at
the State Department on September 14, 2016, representatives of the U.S.
and Israeli governments signed a new 10-year Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) on military aid covering FY2019 to FY2028. [Under the terms of the
MOU, the United States pledges to provide \$38 billion in military aid
(\$33 billion in Foreign Military Financing grants plus \$5 billion in
missile defense appropriations) to Israel.]{.underline} This MOU
replaces a previous \$30 billion 10-year agreement, which runs through
FY2018. Israel is the first international operator of the F-35 Joint
Strike Fighter, the Department of Defense's fifth-generation stealth
aircraft, considered to be the most technologically advanced fighter jet
ever made. To date, [Israel has purchased 50 F-35s in three separate
contracts.]{.underline} P.L. 115-141, the FY2018 Consolidated
Appropriations Act, provides the following for Israel:  [\$3.1 billion
in Foreign Military Financing, of which \$815.3 million is for offshore
procurement;  \$705.8 million for joint U.S.-Israeli missile defense
projects, including \$92 million for Iron Dome, \$221.5 million for
David\'s Sling, \$310 million for Arrow 3, and \$82.3 million for Arrow
2;  \$47.5 million for the U.S.-Israeli anti-tunnel cooperation

At the end of his talk Zawahra called on us to support non-violent
Palestinian resistance in a variety of ways. Resistance is vital to our
survival when someone not only tries to destroy us physically, but
attempts to erase us from history and from collective memory by
annihilating our very spirit, culture, memory of, and narrative about
what we are experiencing. I came away from the conference with a strong
sense of clarity and urgency. [I realised that alongside our efforts to
liberate the Palestinians from Israeli settler-colonialism through
Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) and other means, we must also
**liberate our language**.]{.underline} In fact, liberating our language
might be the key to achieving liberation on the ground. [In order to
mobilise opposition to Israel and put our collective foot down once and
for all, we need to get rid of euphemisms and false language **and call
what Israel does by its real name,
\'settler-colonialism\'**]{.underline}. In my writings and talks I have
been avoiding the words, \'occupation\', \'conflict\' and \'peace\'.
[These words in the context of Palestine-Israel have long felt false and
misleading. Israelis who are more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause
use these words extensively, and even mainstream Zionist Israelis live
with them reasonably comfortably]{.underline}. Outside Israel the vast
majority of analysts and commentators use these words [frequently. They
are ever-present in titles and contents of articles of even progressive
thinkers, and in the verbal narratives used in mass media reports.
\'Occupation\', \'conflict\' and \'peace\' are paralysing words that
usher us away from the \'scene of the crime\', and send us on a wild
goose chase after \'peace talks\' --- yet another fictitious and
fraudulent phrase in the reality of Palestine-Israel]{.underline}. When
we use our language to define problems incorrectly, we then apply
irrelevant or wrong solutions. [These three words are convenient and
safe --- indeed an effective tool in **Israel\'s psychological and
propaganda wars**]{.underline}. On the propaganda front, [they help to
obscure reality by trying to tell us that we are dealing with a
\'simple\' case of occupation]{.underline}, and a conflict between two
equal groups, and conflicts end when there is peace[. The word
\'occupation\' also falsely suggests that the problem in
Palestine-Israel dates back only to 1967. As Ilan Pappé reminded us on
Saturday, occupations end and conflicts can be resolved through
discussions and negotiations]{.underline}. That\'s what the less
informed observer would expect when he or she hears these words. Things
might be bad just now and it might take a while, but because it is an
\'occupation\' and a \'conflict\', there is always hope for a
\'peaceful\' resolution. **[Allowing people to believe that it is only a
matter of time is an important and effective stalling tactic for Israel
while it seeks to complete its settler-colonial project]{.underline}**.
[On the psychological front these words serve to confuse the general
public both inside and outside Israel and paralyse effective
activism.]{.underline} Many good people with a social conscience and
with empathy have told me over the years that they avoid expressing
their feelings and opinions about Palestine-Israel because they don\'t
feel they understand the issues well enough. \'It seems so complicated\'
is such a common sentiment. Our political leaders, on all sides of
politics in the most influential countries in the West are either
intellectually lazy, dishonest or cowardly[. But this language helps
them enforce this paralysis and their lack of willingness to do the
right thing and support the indigenous people of Palestine as they are
gradually squeezed out by Israel.]{.underline} [**If we call a crime a
crime, we can act against it.** But while we say it is something else,
we don\'t have to act, or we act in an irrelevant way.]{.underline} Many
people already know that language is political. That\'s not a new idea.
[Language isn\'t just an innocent and neutral tool for us to communicate
with one another. How we talk about issues, the language we use,
doesn\'t just \*express\* how we perceive reality, it can and often does
\*determine\* our perception of reality]{.underline}. [Language provides
the parameters for discussion, and marks the boundary between the
sayable and unsayable. Language provides a distinct identity to groups
and to ideas, and distinguishes them from other groups and
ideas]{.underline}. As our understanding of issues deepens, so does our
language, and as our courage (or frustration) grows, we salvage the
unsayable and make it sayable. We can dissolve groups with a change of
language, and we can cross over from one group to another as we change
our language. [Listening to language and terminology warns us about the
\'wrong\' people, and lets us know who we should listen to and who we
shouldn\'t, that is if we don\'t want to find ourselves in the fringes
of our groups or completely out in the cold]{.underline}. There are
plenty of examples of all of these in the way we talk about
Palestine-Israel. [Settler-colonialist projects not only take over land
and remove the existing inhabitants. If they want to overcome their
victims, take what was theirs and get away with the crime, they must
also control the language used to talk about what\'s
happening]{.underline}. [Indigenous people\'s voices and narratives have
traditionally been weaker and less present than those of the
settler-colonists groups]{.underline}. (Why this might so is the subject
for another article and is probably already the topic of writings about
colonialism and settler-colonialism.) If that was not the case, the
indigenous people would be more successful in driving the
settler-colonialists out and taking back what is theirs. There is a good
reason why we say that history is written by the victors. But it\'s not
just history in hindsight, it\'s also the moment-to-moment narrative
that is dictated by those who colonise and settle and who are the more
powerful side in a story like this. In terms of language and narrative,
Israel has created two effective traps for us. One is the \'antisemitism
trap\' and the other is the \'specialness trap\'. [It is almost
impossible to speak about Palestine-Israel without worrying about, or at
least mentioning antisemitism. Israel successfully tied antisemitism
both to supporting the Palestinians and to criticising Israel. Not only
are we told that criticising Israel is antisemitism, but anyone who
supports the Palestinians has to worry that they might be an
antisemite]{.underline}. I have encountered this more times than I can
think over the years. People genuinely worry about it, and it stops them
from speaking out or expressing their feelings openly. Worrying about
antisemitism, discussing it ad nauseam, successfully distracts us and
paralyses the struggle for a change on policy on Israel, and delays any
decisive action on behalf of the Palestinians. The \'specialness trap\'
is even more insidious. [Jewish Israeli group psychology is very similar
to the psychology of a cult]{.underline}. One of the hallmarks of cults
is their feeling that they are special and that everything about them,
who they are, what they believe, what they do, even their destiny, are
special. [Moreover, because of this specialness they cannot be judged or
evaluated by the same rules that apply to everyone else.]{.underline}
[They are effectively outside the laws of general society]{.underline}.
(Yes, cults fit well under the definition of a Narcissistic Personality
Disorder[). The state of Israel would like to trick us to think that
what it is doing Palestine cannot be judged in the same way and under
the same rules as other similar projects]{.underline}. [The specialness
trap here is designed to continue to make us believe that the Jewish
people and the Jewish state are special and that the Palestinians are
also special. We are expected to think that the Jews who settled and
colonised Palestine are not like any other settler-coloniser in history
and the victims, the Palestinians, are not like any other victims in
history]{.underline}. [Israel has worked hard to make us believe that
the Palestinians are \'bad\' people who deserve what they are getting,
or even that they are not a people at all]{.underline}. [The
dehumanisation of the Palestinians has a long history dating right back
to the 19th century]{.underline}. Insisting on applying the correct
label to what Zionism is doing in Palestine namely,
\'settler-colonialism\', frees our language from both traps. It
liberates us from confusion about what\'s really going on, and from
giving Israel a special dispensation. The occupation is real alright,
but it isn\'t the real problem. It is only a tool in the bigger project
of Jewish settler-colonialism in Palestine[. The so-called conflict is a
result of the resistance of yet another indigenous people to yet another
settler-colonialist group]{.underline}. There is nothing special about
the perpetrator and nothing special about the victim. To talk about
settler-colonialism is to talk about a crime against humanity by
humanity. This is not so complicated. We have to go back to the same
line of thinking that made Hannah Arendt so unpopular in Israel.
Covering the Eichmann trial in Jerusalem, she sought to learn universal
lessons from the holocaust, rather than see it as a special case. She
wanted to understand what can lead ordinary people like Eichmann to
collude and facilitate such evil against their fellow humans. She
recognised that this happens all the time in human experience. She
talked about the banality of evil, and called for the development of a
more robust framework of international law to cover crimes against
humanity. [But Israel hates the idea that the holocaust is just another
genocide, another crime against humanity committed by
humanity.]{.underline} It has always refused to allow its own people and
the outside world to learn a universal lesson from it. Jewish people
have been taught to see the holocaust as a unique event in human
history, and themselves as the greatest victims in human history. As the
historian Benny Morris said in an interview with Ari Shavit in Ha\'aretz
in 2004, \'We are the greater victims in the course of history and we
are also the greater potential victim. Even though we are oppressing the
Palestinians, we are the weaker side here.\' [Jewish Israelis and many
Jews around the world have been conditioned to believe that anything
that happens to anyone else pales by comparison to what has happened to
the Jews]{.underline}. This too is convenient, because it means that
whatever is inflicted on the Palestinians, however much they suffer even
at the hands of Israel, cannot be as bad as what happened to us. I
myself used to believe this in my past, and it was a feature of my very
identity. The Palestinians do not have a specialness complex. For them
it is a given that the crime against them is a terrible injustice
against human beings committed by other human beings, regardless of who
they are. Many Palestinians I speak to often ask me with genuine
puzzlement why this is happening to them. Most Palestinians are stumped
by the world\'s lack of action on their behalf and by the universal
support for Israel in the face of such overwhelming evidence of the
nature of the crime against them. If we really want to help the
Palestinians, we must examine our language, and we must not compromise.
We can protest all we like, but if we continue to use words like
\'occupation\', \'conflict\' and \'peace\' we simply play within the
rules and the traps that Israel has created for us. [To resist a
paradigm we can\'t operate from within it, or we risk being impotent and
ineffectiv]{.underline}e. In science when a theory does not fit
empirical reality, the theory has to change or go. It\'s bad and
fraudulent science to \'fudge\' or ignore evidence just to keep a theory
we like, or that serves us somehow. The empirical evidence on the ground
does not fit an \'occupation\' or a \'conflict\' theory, but it does fit
settler-colonialism perfectly and it\'s there for everyone to see.
[Israel is a product of an ongoing settler-colonial project that started
back in the late 19th century with the creation of the Zionist movement.
In fact Zionism is settler-colonialism, and anyone who supports Zionism
supports settler-colonialism. To be effective activists for ending
Israeli settler-colonialism]{.underline}, [we must be]{.underline} good
scientists and [make sure that the language we]{.underline} use, our
theory, [fits with the evidence]{.underline}. As long as we are bad
scientists, we actively enable a crime against humanity to continue to
march uninterrupted and with impunity to its terrible conclusion.
**[This is unforgiveable]{.underline}**

### Reverse Causal 

#### Applying Pressure is Reverse Causal \-\-- Israel uses American weapons to brutally oppress Palestinians -- stopping arms sales puts pressure on them to find a solution to the conflict.

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} military [[alliance between the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and Israel
has]{.underline}]{.mark} long [[been]{.underline} **[at
odds]{.underline}** [with]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline} stated
[intentions of successive administrations in Washington to **foster
[peace]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the Holy Land. One White House after
another has preferred the "solution" of having it both ways: supporting
a two-state solution while richly rewarding, with lethal weaponry, an
incorrigible client state that was working as fast as it could to
undermine just such a solution. This ongoing duality seemed at its most
surreal in the last few weeks. First, President [[Obama announced the
new]{.underline}]{.mark} military [[deal]{.underline}]{.mark}, with its
promised delivery of fighter jets and other hardware, citing the
"unshakable" American military alliance with Israel. [The following
week]{.underline}, at the United Nations, [he declared]{.underline},
"**[Israel must recognize]{.underline}** that **[it
cannot]{.underline}** permanently occupy and **[settle Palestinian
land.]{.underline}**" Next, he flew to Israel for the funeral of Shimon
Peres, and in a tribute to the Nobel Prize--winning former Israeli
president, spoke of a man who grasped that "the Jewish people weren't
born to rule another people" and brought up the "unfinished business" of
the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. (Peres is remembered quite
differently by Palestinians as an early pioneer of settlement building
and the author of the brutal Operation Grapes of Wrath assaults on
Lebanon in 1996.) Not long after the funeral, [[the
government]{.underline}]{.mark} of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
[**brazenly [approved]{.mark}** [a new settlement]{.mark}]{.underline}
deep [[in the West Bank]{.underline}]{.mark}, prompting the State
Department to "strongly condemn" the action as "deeply troubling." Such
[[scolding words]{.underline},]{.mark} however, **[[shrivel into
nothing]{.mark}ness]{.underline}** [[in the face of]{.underline}]{.mark}
a single number: **[[38 billion]{.underline}]{.mark}**. With its latest
promise of military aid, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [has]{.underline} essentially
**[[sanctioned Israel's impunity]{.underline}]{.mark}**, its endless
[colonization]{.underline} of Palestinian land, its [military
occupation]{.underline} of the West Bank, [and]{.underline} its periodic
[attacks by]{.underline} F-16 [fighter jets]{.underline} and Apache
helicopters using Hellfire missiles **[on]{.underline}** the
**[civilians]{.underline}** of Gaza. Yes, Hamas's crude and occasionally
deadly rockets sometimes help provoke Israeli fire, and human rights
investigations have found that both sides have committed war crimes. But
Israel's explosive power in the 2014 Gaza war, fueled in large part by
American military aid and political support, exceeded that of Hamas by
an estimated 1,500-to-1. By one estimate, [[all of Hamas's
rockets]{.underline}]{.mark}, measured in explosive power, [[were equal
to]{.underline} **[12]{.underline}** [of the]{.underline}]{.mark}
[one-ton [bombs Israel dropped]{.mark} on Gaza]{.underline}. And it
loosed hundreds of those, and fired tens of thousands of shells, rockets
and mortars. In the process, nearly **[250 times]{.underline}** [more
Palestinian civilians died than civilians in Israel]{.underline}. Now,
with Gaza severed from the West Bank, and Palestinians facing new waves
of settlers amid a half-century-long military occupation, [[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[has chosen
not to apply pressure]{.underline}]{.mark} to its out-of-control ally,
[[but]{.mark} instead [to]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[resupply]{.mark}
its]{.underline}** armed **[[forces]{.underline}]{.mark}** in a massive
way. This means that we've finally arrived at something of a historic
(if hardly noticed) moment. After all these decades, [[the two-state
solution]{.underline}]{.mark}, critically flawed as it was,
[[should]{.underline}]{.mark} now officially [[be declared]{.underline}
**[dead]{.underline}**]{.mark}---and consider the United States an
accomplice in its murder. In other words, the Obama administration has
handed Israel's leaders and the neoconservatives who have long
championed this path the victory they've sought for more than two
decades. THE CHAOS KIDS Twenty years ago, the pro-Israel hard right in
America designed the core strategy that helped lead to this American
capitulation. In 1996, a [Task Force]{.underline} led by neocons Richard
Perle (future chairman of the Defense Policy Board), David Wurmser
(future senior Middle East adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney),
Douglas Feith (future undersecretary of defense), and others issued a
policy paper aimed at incoming Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu. "A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm"
advocated that Israel walk away from its embrace of the Oslo peace
process and Oslo's focus on territorial concessions. The paper's
essential ingredients included weakening Israel's neighbors via regime
change in Saddam Hussein's Iraq and "roll back" in Syria and Iran. The
authors' recommendations turned out to be anything but a wish list,
given that a number of them would soon hold influential positions in the
administration of George W. Bush. As journalist Jim Lobe wrote in 2007:
\[T\]he [Task Force]{.underline}, which was chaired by Perle, argued
that regime change in Iraq---of which Feith was among the most ardent
advocates within the Pentagon---would enable Israel and the U.S. to
decisively shift the [Balance of Power]{.underline} in the region so
that Israel could make a "clean break" from the Oslo process (or any
framework that would require it to give up "land for peace") and, in so
doing, "secure the realm" against Palestinian territorial claims. In
other words, as early as 1996, these neocons were already imagining what
would become the disastrous invasion of Iraq in 2003. You could argue,
of course, that neither the neocons nor Netanyahu could have foreseen
the chaos that would follow, with Iraq nearly cracking open and Syria
essentially collapsing into horrific civil war and violence, civilians
stranded under relentless bombing, and the biggest refugee crisis since
World War II gripping Europe and the world. But you would, at least in
some sense, be wrong, for certain of the [neocon advocates]{.underline}
of regime change [imagined chaos as an essential part of the
process]{.underline} from early on. "One can only hope that we turn the
region into a caldron, and faster, please," wrote Michael Ledeen of the
American Enterprise Institute in National Review during the buildup to
the invasion of Iraq. (In 1985, as a consultant to the National Security
Council and to Oliver North, Ledeen had helped broker the illegal
arms-for-hostages deal with Iran by setting up meetings between weapons
dealers and Israel.) "The war won't end in Baghdad," Ledeen later wrote,
in The Wall Street Journal. "We must also topple terror states in Tehran
and Damascus." The neocons got so much more than they bargained for in
Iraq, and so much less than they wanted in Syria and Iran. Their recent
attempts---with Netanyahu as their chief spokesman---to block the Obama
administration's Iran nuclear deal, for example, went down in flames.
Still, it's stunning to think just how much their strategy of regime
change and chaos helped transform our world and the Greater Middle East
for the worse, and to be reminded that its ultimate goal, at least in
those early days, was in large part to keep Israel from having to pursue
a peace deal with the Palestinians. Of course, there were other benefits
the neocons imagined back then as part of their historic attempt to
redraw the map of the Middle East. Controlling some of the vast oil
reserves of that region was one of them, but of course that didn't
exactly turn out to be a "mission accomplished" moment either. Only the
Israeli part of the plan seemed to succeed as once imagined. So here we
are 20 years later. All around the Holy Land, states are collapsing or
at least their foundations are crumbling, and Israel's actions make
clear that it isn't about to help improve the situation in any way. It
visibly intends to pursue a policy of colonization, permanent human
rights violations, and absolute rule over the Palestinians. These are
facts on the ground that former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, Netanyahu,
the Israeli right wing, and those American neocon visionaries fought so
hard to establish. A succession of leaders in Washington---at least
those who weren't designing this policy themselves---have been played
for fools. In the two-plus decades since the 1993 Oslo Agreement, which
some believed would put Israel and the Palestinians on the path to
peace, and that "Clean Break" document which was written to undermine
it, [[the West Bank]{.mark} settler [population]{.mark} has
[grown]{.mark}]{.underline} from [[109,000 to]{.underline}]{.mark}
nearly **[[400,000]{.underline}]{.mark}** (an estimated 15% of whom are
American). The would-be capital of a Palestinian state, East Jerusalem,
is now surrounded by 17 Jewish settlements. Palestinians nominally
control a mere 18% of the West Bank (also known as Area A), or 4 percent
of the entire land base of Israel/Palestine. [The
Palestinians']{.underline} would-be [homeland is]{.underline} now
[checkered with **military bases**]{.underline},
**[settlements]{.underline}**, **[settlers-only roads]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} hundreds of checkpoints and barriers---all in a West
Bank the size of Delaware, our second-smallest state. An estimated 40
percent of adult male Palestinians, and thousands of children, have seen
the insides of Israeli jails and **[prisons]{.underline}**; many of them
languish there without charges. Israel has, in essence, created a Jim
Crow--like separate and unequal reality there: a one-state "solution"
that it alone controls. [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[has done]{.underline} almost **[nothing]{.underline}** [about
this]{.underline} (other than carefully couched, periodic State
Department words of complaint), while its ally marched forward
unchecked. [[Not since]{.underline}]{.mark} James Baker was secretary of
state under [[the first]{.mark} President [Bush]{.mark}]{.underline}
before---notably enough---the signing of the Oslo accords [[has
any]{.underline}]{.mark} US [[leader threatened to withhold
funds]{.underline}]{.mark} unless Israel stops building settlements on
Palestinian land. The phrase "friends don't let friends drive drunk" no
longer applies in US-Israeli relations. Rather, what we hear are regular
pledges of "absolute, total, unvarnished commitment to Israel's
security." Those were, in fact, the words of Vice President Joe Biden
during a 2010 visit to Israel---a pledge offered, as it turned out, only
a few hours before the Netanyahu government announced the construction
of 1,600 new apartments in East Jerusalem. "Unvarnished commitment" in
2016 means that [**[\$38 billion]{.underline}**
[for]{.underline}]{.mark} what Obama called "the world's most advanced
weapons technology." That includes 33 of Lockheed's [F-35]{.underline}
Joint Strike [[Fighter jets]{.underline}]{.mark}, at \$200 million per
jet, part of a troubled \$1.5 trillion weapons system subsidized by US
taxpayers. Other deadly hardware headed for Israel: [cargo
planes]{.underline}, [F-15 fighter jets]{.underline}, [battle
[tanks]{.mark}]{.underline}, armored [personnel carriers]{.underline}, a
new class of [warships whose [guided missiles]{.mark} would]{.underline}
undoubtedly **[be [aimed directly at Gaza]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [and
more]{.underline} of Lockheed's Hellfire [missiles]{.underline}. If
recent history is any indication, you would need to add fresh supplies
of bombs, grenades, torpedoes, [Rocket Launcher]{.underline}s, mortars,
howitzers, machine guns, shotguns, pistols, and bayonets. As part of the
agreement, US [[arms manufacturers will]{.underline}]{.mark} soon
[[supply 100 percent of]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[weaponry]{.underline}]{.mark}, while Israeli weapons manufacturers
will be phased out of US military aid. "It's a win-win for Israeli
security and the U.S. economy," a White House aide cheerily told the
Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz. THE ([TRUMP]{.underline}) WHITE HOUSE AND
ISRAEL Current policy, if that's the right word, could perhaps be summed
up as weapons, weapons, and more weapons, while Washington otherwise
washed its hands of what was always known as "the peace process"
(despite that fig leaf still in place). Today, functionally, there's no
such process left. And that's unlikely to change under either a
President Clinton or a President [Trump]{.underline}. If anything, it
may get worse. During the Democratic primary campaign, for instance,
Hillary Clinton promised to invite Netanyahu to the White House "during
my first month in office" in order to "reaffirm" Washington's
"unbreakable bond with Israel." In a speech to the American Israel
Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), which labels itself "America's
pro-Israel lobby," she was virtually silent on the Israeli settlement
issue, except to promise to protect Israel against its own violations of
international law. She attacked [Trump]{.underline} from the right,
denouncing his once-expressed wish to remain "neutral" on the issue of
Israel and Palestine. In the 1990s, as first lady, Clinton had stirred
controversy by uttering the word "Palestine" and kissing Yasser Arafat's
widow, Suha, on the cheek. Now she fully embraces those who believe
Israel can do no wrong, including Hollywood mogul Haim Saban, who has
donated at least \$6.4 million to her campaign, and millions more to the
Clinton Foundation and the Democratic National Committee. Saban, an
Israeli-American whose billions came largely from the Mighty Morphin
Power Rangers franchise, describes himself as "a one-issue guy, and my
issue is Israel." Last year, he convened a "secret" Las Vegas meeting
with fellow billionaire Sheldon Adelson, the bankroller of a panoply of
Republican candidates and a huge supporter of Israel's settlement
project. Their aim: to shut down, if not criminalize, the
pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, or BDS.
That boycott movement targets cultural institutions and businesses
including those that profit from the occupation of the West Bank. Its
approach is akin to the movement to impose sanctions on South Africa
during the apartheid era. Top of Form

Bottom of Form

With Saban's millions destined for her campaign war chest, Clinton wrote
to her benefactor to express her "alarm" over BDS, "seeking your
thoughts and recommendations" to "work together to counter BDS." Yet
it's a nonviolent movement that aims to confront Israel's human rights
abuses through direct economic and political pressure, not guns or
terror attacks. Would Clinton prefer suicide bombers and rockets? Never
mind that the relatively modest movement has been endorsed by an
assortment of international trade unions, scholarly associations, church
groups, the Jewish Voice for Peace, and Nobel Peace Prize winner Desmond
Tutu. At the root of BDS, Clinton has hinted darkly, is anti-Semitism.
"At a time when anti-Semitism is on the rise across the world," she
wrote Saban, "we need to repudiate forceful efforts to malign and
undermine Israel and the Jewish people." As for [Trump]{.underline},
some Palestinians were encouraged by his statement to MSNBC's Joe
Scarborough that he might "be sort of a neutral guy" on the issue. He
told the AP: "I have a real question as to whether or not both sides
want to make it. A lot will have to do with Israel and whether or not
Israel wants to make the deal---whether or not Israel's willing to
sacrifice certain things." Yet [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} subsequently
[fell in line with Republican orthodoxy]{.underline},
[[pledg]{.mark}ing]{.underline} among other things [[to move
the]{.underline}]{.mark} US [[Embassy to Jerusalem]{.underline}]{.mark},
a litmus test for supporters of the hard right in Israel, and a virtual
guarantee that East Jerusalem, at the center of the Palestinian dream of
statehood, will remain in Israel's hands. In the short term, then, the
prospect for an American-brokered just peace may be as bleak as it's
ever been---even though US officials know full well that [[a just
solution]{.underline}]{.mark} to the conflict [[would
remove]{.underline} [a]{.underline}]{.mark} primary [[recruiting tool
for jihadists]{.underline}]{.mark}. For the next four to eight years,
American leadership will, by all indications, shore up the status quo,
which means combining all that weaponry and de facto acquiescence in
Israel's land grabs with, perhaps, the occasional hand-wringing State
Department statement.

### Zionist Movements are Growing Now 

#### Zionist grassroots movements are growing due to U.S. support

Khalidi, Edward Said Professor of Arab Studies at Columbia University,

several journal articles and books, most recently Brokers of Deceit: How
the U.S. Has Undermined Peace in the Middle East. [May 10,

'A Failed Settler-Colonial Project
<https://palestinesquare.com/2018/05/10/israel-a-failed-settler-colonial-project/>(JR)

However, [two new phenomena have ominous implications for the Zionist
colonial-settler project and for the Greater Israel movement that
dominates Israel. The first has developed among Palestinians, who
understand the futility of the approach of both wings of their national
movement, those located in Ramallah and Gaza. Instead of futile
diplomacy and pointless and easily exploited armed resistance,
nonviolent grass-roots movements are growing stronger]{.underline}. They
range from the boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movement to the
kind of marches we've seen for the past several weeks in Gaza. Despite
what we're told in the media, [Palestinians have long employed
nonviolent tactics in their quest for liberation. Like the ground-up,
community-based, and mainly nonviolent resistance witnessed during the
general strike of 1936 and the first intifada from 1987 until the early
'90s, this involves a fertile and inventive range of efforts. Such an
approach terrifies the Israeli security establishment, which depends on
demonizing any Palestinian resistance to absolute Israeli dominance as
"terrorism" and then smashing it]{.underline}. As retired Israeli Maj.
Gen. Amos Gilad said of Israel's response to Palestinian nonviolence,
"We don't do Gandhi very well."'The other new development is in the
United States. The growing dissent from the consensus of idiocy on
Palestine that grips most of [the US political and media class is a
remarkable phenomenon. This dissent encompasses universities and
colleges, most recently Barnard, where a resolution supporting
divestment from companies that benefit from the oppression of
Palestinians passed overwhelmingly. It includes the Movement for Black
Lives, whose [platform](https://policy.m4bl.org/platform/) includes a
clear rejection of Israeli apartheid practices and the overlapping
tactics and ideologies of the Israeli and US police states.]{.underline}
It also includes the Democratic Party, where the gap between the
increasingly enlightened grassroots and a leadership still addled by
Israel-advocacy Kool-Aid is growing apace. Most strikingly, however, it
is profoundly affecting the American Jewish community, where there is
growing revulsion at the increasingly intolerant, illiberal,
fundamentalist, and racist cast of Israeli politics and society. None of
this means that we are on the brink of a just peace in Palestine that
would enable two peoples to live as equals in the same land.
Nevertheless, after seven decades of [attempting to replace one people
by another, Zionism faces the unsustainability of such a project in the
21st century. Edward Said wrote that, at the outset, Zionism "won the
political battle for Palestine in the international world in which
ideas, representation, rhetoric, and images were at issue." It is losing
that battle today, which is a cause for optimism for those who seek
peace with justice for Palestinians and Israelis.]{.underline}

Intervention -- Past is present: Settler colonialism in Palestine
<https://antipodefoundation.org/2012/06/08/intervention-past-is-present-settler-colonialism-in-palestine/>(JR)

[For natives', as Patrick Wolfe puts it, 'the issue is that, at the
hands of the settlers, they face \[physical and symbolic\]
elimination']{.underline}.[^\[6\]^](https://antipodefoundation.org/2012/06/08/intervention-past-is-present-settler-colonialism-in-palestine/#_edn6) Given
such a threat, the central question for committed scholarship and
[liberatory movements should be how to develop a praxis that brings back
decolonisation and liberation as the imperative goal. The advantage of
advancing settler colonialism as a relevant interpretative framework for
the study of Zionism is not only that it can offer conceptual and
political possibilities for how we read Palestine today]{.underline},
but that it also dismantles deep-seeded analyses and assumptions
sustaining claims of exceptionalism. [It brings Israel into comparison
with cases such as South Africa]{.underline}, Rhodesia and
French-Algeria, and earlier settler colonial formations such as the
United States, Canada or Australia, rather than the contemporary
European democracies to which Israel seeks comparison. [For Palestine,
it means the reiteration of the fact that Palestinians are an indigenous
people, and an alignment of Palestine scholarship with indigenous and
native studies. In this context, John Collins notes, the challenge:'is
to bring all the relevant tools of critically engaged scholarship
\[...\] in order to pursue two related objectives: to understand the
complex set of structures and processes \[...\] that have combined to
produce the intolerable reality evident today; and to think creatively
about how this understanding might enable individuals to transform that
reality'.[^\[7\]^](https://antipodefoundation.org/2012/06/08/intervention-past-is-present-settler-colonialism-in-palestine/#_edn7)Otherwise,
settler colonialism remains a descriptive category that does not move
beyond sentiment and into strategy]{.underline}. While activists, both
in Palestine and outside it, continue to push back against Zionist
encroachment, intensify the demand for equal rights, and build a
boycott, divestment and sanctions movement aimed at shaming and
delegitimizing Israel internationally, the creative offerings of the
settler colonial studies paradigm remain underutilized. [This lack of
rigorous engagement has consequences for movement building. The historic
response to settler colonialism has been the struggle for
decolonization; in the absence of a settler colonial analysis,
Palestinian strategies have tended to target or accommodate settler
colonial outcomes rather than aiming to decolonize the structure itself.
Equally important, the analysis enabled by the settler colonial paradigm
offers a powerful political tool to reorient and recreate genuine
bi-directional solidarity alliances and political fraternity. As
attested by the cover of this issue, a declaration of solidarity for
Palestinians in their struggle against Zionist aggression by the
Organization of Solidarity for the People of Asia, Africa and Latin
America (OSPAAAL), this convergence is not new.]{.underline} The settler
colonial perspective offers the possibility of a new in-gathering of
movements, harnessing each other's strengths for an active, mutual, and
principled Palestinian alignment with the Arab struggle for
self-determination, and indigenous struggles in North America, Latin
America, Oceania, and elsewhere. Such an alignment would expand the
tools available to Palestinians and their solidarity movement, and
reconnect the struggle to its own history of anti-colonial
internationalism. At its core, this internationalist approach asserts
that the Palestinian struggle against Zionist settler colonialism can
only be won when it is embedded within, and empowered by, broader
struggles -- all anti-imperial, all anti-racist, and all struggling to
make another world possible.

### Water Impact

#### Israel's illegal settlements create a monopoly on water and create shortages of Palestinian water supplies

ADRI **NIEUWHOF**, 2-1-20**13**, (Adri Nieuwhof is a human rights

The **[[Israel]{.underline}]{.mark}**i [national **water company Mekorot
[undermines Palestinians' access to water]{.mark}**]{.underline},
according to a new report commissioned by the United Nations Human
Rights Council. The
[report](http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session19/FFM/FFMSettlements.pdf)
finds that [deep **[water drillings]{.mark} by Mekorot and** the
**Israeli** agri-industrial firm Mehadrin **[in the occupied
Jordan]{.mark} Valley [have caused]{.mark} the [drying up of Palestinian
wells]{.mark}** and springs.]{.underline} About [**[80 percent
of]{.mark} all [water]{.mark} drilled** in this area **is [consumed by
Israel and its illegal settlements]{.mark}** in the West
Bank.]{.underline} Mekorot took over responsibility for the West Bank's
water resources from the Israeli military in 1982. [**[The]{.mark}** new
[**report** **documents a clear pattern of discrimination against
Palestinians**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Whereas [**[Palestinians]{.mark}**
living in most of the West Bank **[face "chronic shortages," Israeli
settlements enjoy]{.mark}** a [**constant** supply of **water**.]{.mark}
Palestinians are prevented from using wastewater provided to [Israeli
settlements]{.mark} for irrigation and instead have to rely on more
expensive water for that purpose]{.underline}. Furthermore, [valves
supplying Palestinians tend to be [cut off]{.mark} when [water]{.mark}
shortages occur]{.underline}, yet no such restrictions are applied to
the use of water by Israeli settlers. The World Health Organization
recommends that each individual should have access to 100 liters of
water per day. Israeli settlers in the West Bank typically consume 400
liters per day, the report states, while Palestinians have to make do
with just 73 liters or, in the case of Palestinian Bedouins, as little
as 10 liters. Hampered The new UN report is the result of a mission
investigating Israeli settlements in the West Bank, including East
Jerusalem. [Israel tried to hamper field visits to Israel]{.underline}
and the West Bank by the mission, led by French magistrate [Christine
Chanet](http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/membersCVs/chanet.htm),
by ignoring five request for cooperation. However, the mission succeeded
in obtaining first-hand information during meetings held in Jordan. The
report highlights the role of businesses in Israel's settlements.
Information gathered by the mission shows that **[private [firms have
e]{.mark}nabled, [facilitated and profited]{.mark}, directly and
indirectly, [from]{.mark} the construction and growth of [the
settlements]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It identified a number of business
activities that raise particular concerns about abuses of human rights.
They include: • The supply of equipment and materials facilitating the
construction of settlements and Israel's wall in the West Bank; • The
supply of surveillance and identification equipment for settlements, the
wall and military checkpoints; • The supply of equipment for the
demolition of housing and property, including the destruction of farms,
greenhouses, olives groves and crops,; • The supply of security
services, equipment and materials to businesses operating in
settlements; • The provision of transport and other services to support
the maintenance of settlements; • Banking and financial operations
helping to develop, expand or maintain settlements and their activities,
including loans for housing and business development; • The use of
natural resources, in particular water and land, for business purposes;
• Pollution, dumping and transfer of waste to Palestinian villages; •
The way Palestinian financial and economic markets are held captive by
Israel, as well as practices that disadvantage Palestinian businesses,
including through restrictions on movement, and administrative and legal
constraints. Fully aware According to the new report,
[**[companies]{.mark}** active in the settlements **[are fully
aware]{.mark}** that t**hey are abusing** international law]{.underline}
and contributing [to violations of **human rights**.]{.underline}
Industrial parks in settlements, such as Barkan and Mishor Adumim, are
criticized for enticing firms to the settlements with tax sweeteners and
by emphasizing how Palestinians are paid lower wages than Israeli
workers. Economic activities in these zones are growing, the mission
adds. The mission also notes that [a number of banks provide mortgages
for homebuyers and special loans for building projects in
settlements]{.underline}. In some cases, the banks are physically
present there. It also states that Israel labels all its export products
as originating from Israel, including those wholly or partially produced
in settlements. Some companies operating in settlements have been
accused of hiding the original place of production of their products.
This poses problems for the customs authorities of other countries, as
well as raising issues in relation to consumers' right to information.
[The mission urges private companies to cease operating in the
settlements.]{.underline} The report should prove useful for activists
pushing for boycott, divestment and sanctions against Israel. It states
plainly that **[[firms]{.mark} active [in the settlements are
facilitating abuses of human rights]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### **Israel's settler violence is used to control water resources on the west bank -- that excludes other nations through islampophobic policies**

Sawsan **Ramahi**, 5-11-20**14**, \"Israel is stealing Palestinian and
Arab water,\" Middle East Monitor,
<https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20140511-israel-is-stealing-palestinian-and-arab-water/>
//TimH DA: 6/24/19

There is no doubt that UN interest in this matter is of great
importance, although the world body needs to do more than merely have an
annual day on the issue. [What is required is for the UN to put an end
to the monopoly of water by any state which has water sources within its
borders and to put an end to the diversion and theft of water from
occupied lands. **[When]{.mark} [an occupying power exploits the
resources of the occupied land at the expense of the original
inhabitants, it builds itself on the ruins of what it has
destroyed]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and such theft of resources is
obvious, [even when the occupier tries to hide its actions]{.underline}
behind noble principles. **[[This]{.underline}]{.mark}** malfeasance
[**[is]{.mark} [made worse by claiming]{.mark}** that **[the
land]{.mark}** in question **[is]{.mark} a gift [from God]{.mark}** and
politically-motivated]{.underline} myths such as it is "a land without a
people for a people without land". [When **such wrongdoing is
compounded** even further **by [acts of genocide against the indigenous
people]{.mark}**, killing thousands and dispossessing hundreds of
thousands in acts of ethnic cleansing, the situation is very serious
indeed.]{.underline} Following on from the efforts to destroy the
necessities of life for those under occupation, [**[the occupier has
sought to control the main necessity, the water resources]{.mark}**. The
de facto annexation and **[control of water in]{.mark} the occupied
[Palestinian territories has]{.mark} always [been]{.mark}**, **alongside
[the colonisation of land]{.mark}, one of Israel's priorities.** This
long-standing aim of the Jewish state has been confirmed by confidential
documents]{.underline} published by the British Foreign Office, in which
David Ben-Gurion, writing in 1941, said, "We have to remember that for
the Jewish state's ability to survive it must have within its borders,
the waters of the \[rivers\] Jordan and
[Litani](http://aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/74C3025C-3347-487E-8050-DBFE2424126C.htm?wbc_purpose)"
Israel's control of Arab water Since 1948 [**the [Israeli
authorities]{.mark} have sought to [control]{.mark} the majority of [the
water resources in Palestine]{.mark}**. After the 1967 war Israel gained
control of the main Arab water sources]{.underline} in the Middle
East, 1. The upper Jordan River basin, which originates from Lebanon and
Syria: [Israel Seized the Jordan River]{.underline} and stored its water
in Lake Tiberius (the Sea of Galilee), then transported the water from
north to south to feed the different areas of Israel[. **Israel** gets
60% of this water]{.underline}, while Jordan gets 25% and Syria 15%,
[despite its source being within Syria's borders. [It **has**]{.mark}
**also [prevented]{.mark} the [Palestinians from reaching the Jordan
River]{.mark}**, destroyed all their pumps on the river and evicted the
farmers.]{.underline} As a result of the diversion of water from the
river by Israel the land on both banks has been affected, while the salt
level in the water has increased considerably. 2. Yarmouk River basin
shared between Jordan and Syria: [When Israel occupied the Golan
Heights, it prevented Syria from benefiting from its water;]{.underline}
today 30% of Israel's water comes from the Golan Heights. It also
captured the Syrian water source in the Yarmouk River Basin. The Golan
Heights is the main source of water flowing to the Jordan River and Lake
Tiberius, which provide water to Syria, Jordan and Palestine; this is
why [**[Israel refuses to give up]{.mark} these [water sources]{.mark}
in any negotiation**s with Syria.]{.underline} 3. [Large underground
reservoirs]{.underline} in the West Bank, known as the Reservoir of the
Mountain and the Mountain-Well; the [**Palestinians have been unable to
have access to them since 1967**.]{.underline} When Israel invaded
Lebanon in 1978 it controlled nearly 30% of the Litani River, and during
the occupation of Lebanon in 1982 the Israelis benefited from the
Wazzani and the Litani's waters, transferring water from them to Israel,
while expelling the Lebanese farmers dependent on them. In 1989 the
Israelis took advantage of the Hasbani and Wazzani waters by installing
pipes for themselves, and [despite withdrawing from Lebanon in 2000
there are still many Israeli artesian wells on the borders which reduce
the groundwater in Lebanese territory.]{.underline} Israel uses various
means to control the waters of the River Nile, which is 6825 km long and
has two main sources; the Equatorial Lakes Region of Southern Sudan and
the Ethiopian plateau. Israel tries from time to time to cooperate with
Ethiopia to build dams and other facilities to control the Nile waters,
seeking to reduce Egypt's share of water and put pressure on it in order
to secure its share of Nile water. This much has been disclosed by
senior [officials](http://www.lahona.com/show_files.aspx?fid=345458).
[Control over the waters of the West Bank and Gaza and the water crisis
threaten their populations]{.underline} Since
**[[Israel]{.underline}]{.mark}** began its occupation of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip it [**[has striven to]{.mark} remain in [control]{.mark}
of [the water resources and diverted water from]{.mark} the
[Palestinian]{.mark}** **[territories]{.mark}**]{.underline} to the
cities and settlements set up on the ruins of Palestinian towns
destroyed in 1948. Abdel-Rahman Tamimi, a water expert, says that the
water battle with the occupation started early on, with military orders
and systematic control of water basins, wells and springs since the
occupation of the West Bank started in 1967. According to Mr. Tamimi,
the water sources were placed under the control of the Israeli Civil
Administration in the 1970s, and even after the Oslo agreement they
remained under Israeli control, "which exacerbated the water problem in
the [West
Bank](http://www.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/F39F0ACA-BBC5-440F-8939-7A7B5A30ADDB.htm)."
The Gaza Strip depends on the coastal underground water reservoir that
lies under the Mediterranean Sea between Rafah in the south and north of
Mount Carmel, a total area of 2200 km2, of which 400 km2 is located
underneath the Gaza Strip. This groundwater is largely independent of
the groundwater inside Israel because of the flow of water in an
east-west direction into the reservoir; thus, [the amount of water
available to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip would be reasonable had
Israel not confiscated more than 80% of the Palestinian groundwater to
make up 20% of the Israelis' total water consumption]{.underline} which
stands at 2 billion cubic metres per annum. Due to this, it is estimated
that this underground fresh water source will run dry within the next 8
[years](http://www.qudsnet.com/arabic/news.php?maa=View&id=140360). The
Palestinian Water Authority has explained that the Gaza Strip is
suffering from an annual water deficit of up 70 million cubic metres,
noting that as a result of natural population growth in the Strip there
are now more than a million and a half people depending on a single
source of water, the coastal aquifer, to meet their needs. The authority
also noted the negative effect on the quality of groundwater due to sea
water intrusion, causing high salinity and adding to the high
concentration of nitrates in the water, caused by the leakage of sewage
and the return underground of irrigation water. The authority's report
states that 90-95% of groundwater used for domestic purposes is not fit
for human consumption and not compliant with the World Health
Organization standards for drinking water, in terms of quality and
quantity, which constitutes a serious threat to health and is a cause of
many diseases affecting the population of the Gaza Strip. The Water
Authority says that the rate of water available per person per day is
about 80 litres, equivalent to half the recommendation of the [World
Health
Organization](http://www.insanonline.net/news_details.php?id=9872). The
West Bank depends on artesian wells for drinking and agricultural
purposes. The capacity of running water and water springs in the West
Bank ranges, according to the estimates of many experts, between 30 and
50 million cubic metres annually. The springs in the West Bank are
estimated to have a capacity of about 75-115 million cubic metres. This
was before the Israelis began to use 730 wells in the West Bank for
different purposes. There are now 214 wells, of which only 20 are
reserved for household purposes, functioning with a production capacity
set by the Israeli authorities at about 37.9 million cubic metres
annually. The remaining wells have dried up due to pumping from deep
wells dug by the Israeli military authorities, or due to being
abandoned. The rate of water consumption of Israel citizens is 344
million cubic metres per year, while the consumption of Palestinians
stands at 93 million cubic metres per year. The domestic consumption of
Israelis amounts to 98 million cubic metres, while for Palestinians it
comes to 56 million cubic metres per year. It is clear that the
[Israelis use and waste more water than anyone else in the
[region](http://pulpit.alwatanvoice.com/content-179410.html).]{.underline}
A study has been made of this issue by the Palestinian Institute for
Economic Policy Research (MAS), prepared by Annan Jayyousi, a lecturer
at the Faculty of Engineering in Al-Najah University and an expert on
the subject of water, and Fathi Srougi, an expert on geopolitical issues
relating to water. Jayyousi referred to the volume of water resources in
historic Palestine, which is estimated by Israelis hydrologists at about
2250 million cubic metres of renewable water, and includes 3 reserves
within the West Bank area producing about 679 million cubic metres of
water[**. According to international law, this water belongs to the
[Palestinians]{.mark} but they only [get]{.mark}** 118 million cubic
metres. In other words, Palestinians get **[just 15% of their own
water]{.mark}** while the rest is consumed by Israelis.]{.underline}
Regarding the use of water for domestic purposes Jayussi said, "The
supply quantity is estimated at about 130 million cubic metres in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip; this means that the average person's water
supply is estimated at around 97 litres per day. That said however, the
actual average consumption falls short of 70 litres per day, due to the
high rate of wasted water." This is due to overdue maintenance work on
the pipe network, among other reasons. Jayussi estimates use by the
industrial sector at a total of about 9 million cubic metres annually.
In the agricultural sector, the study shows that the average share of
irrigated land for an individual is only 0.071 dunams (1000 m2).
Furthermore the use of water for irrigation does not exceed 45 cubic
metres per person, which is less than the prevailing rates in Jordan and
Israel. It must be noted that [**[Israel]{.mark}** has not allowed the
Palestinians to control their water according to their needs, but **tied
them up in resolutions through which the Jewish state**:]{.underline} 1.
**[[Limits the amount of water]{.underline}]{.mark}** withdrawals to no
more than 100 cubic metres per hour. 2. [Limits the depth of drilled
wells]{.underline} to 140 metres, requiring specific types of old pumps
which are permitted in the West Bank, essentially limiting the capacity
to extract water from these wells. 3. [Dug huge wells in strategic areas
where water accumulates across the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in order
to steal Palestinian water]{.underline} (60 wells in the West Bank, 43
in the Gaza Strip, and 26 along the armistice line between [Gaza and
Israel](http://www.alasra.ps/news.php?maa=View&id=10213). 4. [Adopted a
strategy of building small dams to prevent the natural flow of surface
water [to]{.mark} the [Palestinian areas thus allowing the transfer of
high quality water from Israeli settlements]{.mark} in the Palestinian
territories into Israeli cities, or selling this water to the
Palestinians.]{.underline} 5. [Builds settlements such that they are in
areas with the highest quality underground water reserves to allow
Israel to seize the water]{.underline}, directly or indirectly, a policy
which has lead to the depletion of groundwater in the Gaza Strip.
According to a study by the Palestinian Information Centre, 150
Palestinian residential communities in the West Bank are not part of the
water distribution networks. Most residents in these communities suffer
from water shortages. Hebron as a model The city of Hebron, in the south
of the West Bank, is considered the most deprived Palestinian city in
terms of lack of water, where the average Palestinian individual
consumes as little as 10 litres of water per day for extended periods of
[time](http://www.alasra.ps/news.php?maa=View&id=10213). **[[The water
problem]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Hebron [**[is]{.mark}** primarily **a
[result of the Israeli occupation]{.mark}** authority's control over
water basins; Palestinians are not permitted to dig wells and the
Israelis do not provide the water necessary for daily use]{.underline}.
An example illustrates the measures to which the Israelis are prepared
to go with this: [the Israeli army]{.underline} surprised four citizens
from the village of Soba, west of Hebron as they were drilling a well to
collect rainwater; they were [surrounded and arrested, their equipment
was confiscated; they were fined and finally released with strict orders
not to resume drilling.]{.underline} Abdel-Rahman Rajoub has commented
on this: "What is strange is that one of the detainees said that they
had told the investigating officer, during the eight days that they were
in custody, that the drilling was simply for the purpose of collecting
rainwater. The officer accused them of 'stealing groundwater' and told
them that rainwater collection is 'forbidden'." Pools of water destroyed
in Hebron To the east of Hebron, [the Israeli army destroyed four large
pools that collect water, and deprived large areas of agricultural land
of irrigation water, causing great losses to dozens of
farmers]{.underline}. Several said that this is [in order "to harass the
Palestinians and force them into leaving the area, in order to clear it
for settlement building."]{.underline} The residents in this fertile
region have resorted to making holes in water pipes to get the water
needed to irrigate their crops, even though this is at the expense of
their drinking
[water](http://www.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/F39F0ACA-BBC5-440F-8939-7A7B5A30ADDB.htm).
The impact of constructing the wall on water sources in the West Bank In
addition to the tactics noted above that are employed by the Israelis to
seize Palestinian water, [the [occupation authority has used the illegal
"separation wall" to ensure that it also has control of three of the
most important Palestinian water basins, depriving the Palestinians of
their right of access]{.mark} in order to send this [water]{.mark} to
settlements]{.underline}. As the construction of what is basically an
apartheid wall continues in the West Bank, Palestinian official sources
confirm that it will annex to Israel about 95% of the water that is
accessible in the Western Basin, which is estimated at about 362 million
metres. The area isolated behind the western part of the wall lies above
two basins; the western basin and north-east basin, which have an
estimated annual capacity of 507 million cubic metres. The area isolated
in the east lies completely over the eastern basin which has an
estimated capacity of 172 million cubic metres annually. Water is
extracted from these aquifers by pumping from wells or from the natural
springs. The estimated number of groundwater wells in these regions is
165 with a pumping capacity of 33 million cubic metres per year; the
number of springs is estimated to be 53, with a capacity of 22 million
cubic metres per year. In the Jenin, Qalqilya and Tulkarem provinces,
the land annexed by the wall is entirely congruent with the locations of
groundwater, meaning that all the groundwater reserves are on the wrong
that is, the Israeli side of the wall. This renders as useless any
Palestinian attempt to extract water from those reserves; as such, [[the
wall threatens to drive to extinction]{.mark} irrigated agriculture in
the north of the West Bank.]{.underline} According to the report by the
Palestinian Water Authority, the wall has led to the loss of Palestinian
access to more than 36 wells, which includes 23 located directly on the
route of the wall, and 13 others nearby that were used for agriculture
and drinking; these wells now lie between the wall and the old "Green
Line" (the 1967 armistice line). The wells used to pump about 55 million
cubic metres per annum, around 25% of the total extracted from the
Western reservoir. The occupation authorities are also seeking, through
the route of the wall, to seize more than 400 m3 which constitutes the
entire capacity of the renewable groundwater West Basin, of which most
is accumulated within the borders of the Palestinian [West
Bank](http://pulpit.alwatanvoice.com/content-179410.html). Contamination
of groundwater reserves in the West Bank and Gaza Strip **[[Israel
drains the Palestinian groundwater]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which has led
to an increase in the levels of salts, nitrates and chlorides, as well
as heavy metal contaminations such as copper and lead, [which deem it
unsuitable for drinking or agricultural use.]{.underline} The draining
of wells has also caused severe leakage of salty groundwater into fresh
groundwater in the West Bank; in the Gaza Strip seawater has leaked into
the groundwater basin to fill the
[vacuum](http://www.lahona.com/show_files.aspx?fid=345458). The spread
of diseases The Palestinian Ministry of Health confirms the results of
tests showing that [the water in the networks is contaminated
frequently, leading to the spread of diseases among the
population]{.underline}. Analysis has shown a link between the
contamination of water and the spread of diseases, such as typhoid
fever, meningitis and cholera. An official in the Ministry of Health
monitoring committee confirmed that they are examining all water
continually, whether it is drinking water, for agriculture or for other
uses. He said, "There is an ongoing process of filtration and
purification of the water in the wells which reduces the contamination
and salt levels in the water." **[[The Israeli security forces hinder or
prevent the implementation]{.mark} of many [projects that]{.mark} have
the potential to [solve this problem]{.mark}]{.underline}**, he added.
Conclusion From the above we note that [[Israel is the cause of the
water crisis for]{.mark} Palestinians in particular and for [Arabs in
general]{.mark}, **a fact that [the Jewish state refuses to
acknowledge.]{.mark}** [Israel will continu]{.mark}e with its plans to
control more water resources, especially as it seeks to attract
ever-greater numbers of Jewish immigrants.]{.underline} Unfortunately,
the Oslo agreement deferred negotiations of the issue of water to the
anticipated 'final status' agreement, which was one mistake amongst many
committed by the Palestinian negotiators. By agreeing to defer
consideration of the most important issues until the 'final status'
talks (including the status of Jerusalem, the return of refugees as well
as the water issue), they have allowed Israel to introduce many changes
and "facts on the ground" which the Palestinians will just have to
accept. [[The Jewish state avoids discussing the core issues]{.mark}
such as the water problems of the Palestinians and tries to shift the
focus to long-term solutions]{.underline} such as the search for
alternative water sources, desalination plants and a reduction in the
amount needed for agriculture. It is worth remembering that [unless
proposals include Palestinian control over their own natural water
resources, it is useless to talk about an independent Palestinian
state]{.underline}, with real sovereignty over its air, land and sea. It
is equally useless, to consider achieving genuine peace. The United
Nations should take its responsibilities seriously and oblige Israel to
end its illegal occupation of Palestinian land, giving back to the
Palestinians their inalienable rights, including control of its natural
resources[. As long as Israel is treated with kid gloves by the
international community, as a state which is above the law, peace
talks]{.underline} -- proximity or direct -- [will continue to be
diplomatic devices to give the Israelis more time to create more facts
on the ground; and genuine peace and justice will remain as elusive as
ever.]{.underline}

### **[Refugees Impact]{.underline}** 

#### Israel pawns off refugees and forces then into brutal conditions 

**United nations news, 18**

United nations news, 9 January 2018,UN News: UN refugee agency urges
Israel to halt forced relocation of African asylum seekers
https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/01/1000062-un-refugee-agency-urges-israel-halt-forced-relocation-african-asylum-seekers(JR)

[The United Nations refugee agency on Tuesday appealed to the Israeli
Government to not forcibly send Eritrean and]{.underline} [Sudanese
refugees or asylum seekers to sub-Saharan Africa]{.underline}. [This
appeal came after some 80 cases were identified in which people
relocated by Israel risked their lives by taking dangerous onward
journeys to Europe.]{.underline} "Feeling they had [no other
choice](http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/briefing/2018/1/5a548e064/unhcr-appeals-israel-forced-relocations-policy.html),
[they travelled many hundreds of kilometres through conflict zones in
South Sudan, Sudan and Libya after being relocated by
Israel]{.underline}," the spokesperson of the Office of the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees ([UNHCR](http://www.unhcr.org/)), William
Spindler, told reporters in Geneva. He said that along the way, "[they
suffered abuse, torture and extortion before risking their lives once
again by crossing the Mediterranean to Italy.]{.underline}" UNHCR staff
interviewed them in Rome between November 2015 and December 2017 in
reception centres and informal settlements. All were adult males, some
with family members still in Israel, who had entered via the Sinai. "In
every case," he explained, "[they reported torture, mistreatment and
extortion before reaching Israel," adding that some said that others
travelling with them had died en route to Libya]{.underline}. The
majority maintained that they had been transferred from Israel to a
country in Africa and provided with \$3,500 dollars. "However, the
situation on arrival was different to what most had expected -- and with
little further support provided beyond accommodation on the first night.
They reported feeling unsafe, as they were known to have money," he
said. UNHCR is seriously concerned over Israel\'s plans announced on 1
January to forcibly relocate Eritreans and Sudanese to countries in
Africa or have them face indefinite detention. Official statements that
the plans may eventually target families and those with pending asylum
claims, or that asylum seekers might be taken to the airport in
handcuffs, are particularly alarming. "At a time when UNHCR and partners
in the international community are engaged in [emergency evacuations
from Libya, forced relocation to countries that do not offer effective
protection and the onward movement of these people to Libya and Europe
is particularly worrisome]{.underline}," Mr. Spindler underscored. There
are some 27,000 Eritreans and 7,700 Sudanese in Israel, however since
2009, when Israel took over refugee status determination from UNHCR,
only 10 Eritreans and one Sudanese have been recognized as
refugees. While 200 Sudanese from Darfur were granted humanitarian
status in Israel along with an announcement that 300 more will follow,
Israel has not received any Eritreans or Sudanese since May 2016."UNHCR
stands ready to work with Israel to find alternative solutions for the
protection needs of asylum seekers, in line with international
standards," concluded Mr. Spindler.

live in Germany and the Netherlands after leaving Israel in 2015 and

legal residency status and are not granted any basic rights. Most do not
have any official documents or permits. [The asylum seekers also say
that after arriving, they have no official contact with representatives
of the country or with Israel -- and no help, either]{.underline}. At
the beginning of the week, the cabinet unanimously approved a proposal
from Interior Minister Arye Dery and Public Security Minister Gilad
Erdan to make preparations to close down the Holot detention facility in

### **[AT: Israel Needs Weapons]{.underline}** 

#### The Iron Dome solves their offense -- Israel doesn't need any more weapons -- they're protected now.

[[The Iron Dome is Israel's]{.underline} **[most

short-range projectiles. The deployment came after Palestinians in Gaza
started launching incendiary balloons and kites over the border

as precautionary after a ceasefire with Hamas had been agreed to on
Saturday, July 14. However, that ceasefire did not hold, with skirmishes
continuing [and
escalating](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/israel-and-hamas-exchange-fire-in-gaza-palestinian-reports-say-1.6293272)
further on July 20. According to left-leaning Israeli daily, Haaretz,
[almost
**[[200]{.underline}]{.mark}**](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/israel-deploys-iron-dome-in-tel-aviv-area-following-gaza-escalation-1.6271716)
such [[projectiles had been fired]{.mark} into Israel]{.underline}
before the now-failed ceasefire was reached on Saturday night. The
report added that "[a number of rockets]{.underline}" [were
fired]{.underline} from Gaza in the early hours of Sunday and some
Palestinians continued launching the "airborne firebombs" later that
day. "[[Yesterday's attack was]{.underline} **[not strong]{.underline}**
[relative to the Air Force's capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}," a
senior Israeli Air Force official told Haaretz of the retaliation on
Saturday. Still, the same official warned: "We have prepared a large
number of targets that will surprise Hamas, targets such as terror
tunnels, the Beit Lahia battalion in which we attacked some 20 buildings
and a multi-story building in the center of the Gaza Strip that served
Hamas as a training facility with a tunnel underneath it." It appears
that as the situation in Gaza escalated, the IDF decided to strike
several of those targets, with the conflict continuing late into the
night of July 20. Hamas fired three rockets into Israel, two of which
were shot down by **[[Iron Dome]{.underline}]{.mark}**. That missile
defense system, first introduced in 2011, [[is Israel\'s]{.mark} last
line of [defense]{.mark}]{.underline} in **[[intercepting
rockets]{.underline}]{.mark}**, missiles, and mortars close to the
ground. [[It has]{.mark} claimed]{.underline} **[[considerable
success]{.underline}]{.mark}** especially in Israel's conflicts with
Hamas in 2012 and 2014. According [to
Raytheon](https://www.raytheon.com/capabilities/products/irondome) ,
which helps make one of its interceptors, [Iron Dome [is
the]{.mark}]{.underline} "world's **[[most used]{.underline}]{.mark}**

fielded in 2011." Israel has also long maintained a force of
American-made PAC-2 batteries with Israeli upgrades. Like the Iron Dome,
the PAC-2 system is mobile. It relies on the AN/MPQ-53 radar system to
provide detection and targeting information. PAC-2's range is more
than[sixty miles](https://www.mda.mil/news/gallery_pac2.html) with a
maximum altitude of twenty miles, according to America\'s Missile
Defense Agency. Recommended: [Forget the F-35: The Tempest Could Be the

Israel has used its Patriot system in many different conflicts dating
back to the Gulf War in 1990 and 1991. More recently, it has used the
PAC-2 to target enemy drones, including ones from Syria and Hamas. (The
original Patriot systems were designed to deal with aircraft.) However,
the Patriot's effectiveness against missile threats has been questioned
especially in dealing with Saddam Hussein's SCUD missiles in the first
Iraq War. These shortcomings have led to upgrades being made in the form
of the PAC-3 systems, although Israel hasn't purchased any itself.
Instead, Israel has poured more resources into [[the
Arrow]{.underline}]{.mark} missile [defense system]{.underline}, which
[[is more advanced]{.mark} and [has]{.mark} a **[greater
range]{.mark}**]{.underline} than the PAC-2. This has relegated the
PAC-2s to the second line of defense if the Arrows fail. As [Defense
Industry
Daily](https://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/israel-successfully-tests-arrow-theater-missile-defense-01571/)
notes, "[The Israeli Arrow is]{.underline} a **[more
advanced]{.underline}** weapon than the Patriot [and
possesses]{.underline} far **[more range]{.underline}**, undertaking
high altitude interceptions and covering a wide area (est. 90km/ 54 mile
range, maximum altitude 30 miles/ 50 km for Arrow 2) as a Theater
Missile Defense (TMD) system." The Arrow family of systems (Arrow-1,
Arrow-2, and Arrow-3) were jointly funded by Israel and the United
States and developed by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) and Boeing.
Arrow-1 was more of a demonstrator system with the first Arrow-2 system
being declared operational in 2000. [According
to](https://missilethreat.csis.org/defsys/arrow-2/) CSIS's Missile
Threat project, the Arrow-2 "consists of a two-stage interceptor with a
solid propellant rocket motor booster that flies at Mach 9." Unlike many
of the systems America now relies on, [the Arrow-2 doesn't use hit to
kill technology]{.underline}, instead [[relying on a]{.underline}
**[directed fragmentation]{.underline}** [warhead]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The United States and Israel are also teaming up in developing the much
more advanced Arrow-3 missile defense system. This system targets
warheads while they are still in space. It reportedly has a slant range
of [1,500
miles](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/why-israel-testing-its-arrow-3-interceptor-missile%E2%80%94-alaska-21302)
and intercepts targets 62 miles in the sky. Some have suggested it could
eventually be an anti-satellite weapon. As Michael Peck [has
noted](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/why-israel-testing-its-arrow-3-interceptor-missile%E2%80%94-alaska-21302)
, the Arrow-3's range is so great that the United States and Israel
cannot test its limits in the Mediterranean region. Instead, they are
planning to bring it out to Alaska to see its full capabilities.

[[The US Army]{.underline}]{.mark} on Tuesday [[awarded]{.mark} a

[partnered with Rafael]{.mark} to manufacture them. The
TROPHY]{.underline}, known in Hebrew as me'il ruach, or windbreaker, [is
an active defense system]{.underline} manufactured by Rafael that is
[designed to protect tanks]{.underline} and other armored vehicles [from
missiles and rockets]{.underline}. It was first developed by Rafael and
the Israel Aircraft Industries' Elta Group and was declared operational
in 2009. The system is made up of a radar detection system that spots
incoming missiles and predicts their trajectories, and launchers that
fire buckshot-like metal pellets, which cause the incoming missile or
rocket to detonate away from the tank. [[The deal]{.mark} with the US
Army to supply the system and accompanying parts [is worth]{.mark}
\$[193 million]{.mark}]{.underline}, Rafael said in a statement. "Under
the terms of the contract, Leonardo DRS will provide the \[US\] Army

U.S. press coverage of Israeli attacks on the Palestinian Authority and
Palestinian towns on the West Bank often treat the U.S. government as
either an innocent bystander or an honest broker in the current
conflict, often without giving a full sense of the importance of the
United States role as a supplier of arms, aid, and military technology
to Israel. In its role as Israel's primary arms supplier,
[[the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}]{.mark}[nited [S]{.mark}tates [could
exert]{.mark} significant potential [leverage over Israeli
behavior]{.mark} in the conflict]{.underline}, if it chooses to do so.
Military and Economic Aid [[Since 1976, Israel had been the largest
annual recipient of U.S. foreign assistance]{.underline}]{.mark}.
According to a November 2001 Congressional Research Service report,
Israel: U.S. Foreign Assistance, U[.S. [aid to Israel]{.mark} in the
last half century [has totaled]{.mark} a whopping \$[81]{.mark}.3
[billion]{.mark}.]{.underline} In recent years, [[Israel remains the top
recipient of U.S. military]{.mark} and economic
assistance]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The most commonly cited figure is \$3
billion a year, with about \$1.8 billion a year in Foreign Military
Financing (FMF) grants from [the Department of Defense and an additional
\$1.2 billion]{.underline} a year in Economic Support Funds (ESF) from
the Department of State. In the last decade FMF grants to Israel have
totaled \$18.2 billion. In fact, 17% of all U.S. foreign aid is
earmarked for Israel. For 2003, the Bush administration is proposing
that Israel receive \$2.76 billion in foreign aid, with \$2.1 billion in
FMF and \$600 million in ESF. An additional \$28 million will go to
Israel for the purchase U.S. manufactured counter terrorism equipment.
Weapons Sales and Grants [Israel is one of the United State's largest
arms importers. [In the last decade, the United States has sold
Israel]{.mark} \$[7.2 billion]{.mark} in weaponry and military
equipment]{.underline}, \$762 million [[through]{.underline}]{.mark}
Direct Commercial Sales ([[DCS]{.underline}]{.mark})[,]{.mark} more than
\$6.5 billion through the Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program. In
fact, [[Israel]{.mark} is so devoted to U.S. military hardware that it
[has the world's largest fleet of F-16s outside the U.S.,]{.mark}
currently possessing more than 200 jets]{.underline}. Another 102 F-16s
are on order from Lockheed Martin. The United States has also
underwritten Israel's domestic armaments industry, by giving: \$1.3
billion to develop the Lavi aircraft (cancelled) \$625 million to
develop and deploy the Arrow anti-missile missile (an ongoing project)
\$200 million to develop the Merkava tank (operative); the latest
version, the Merkava 4, uses a German V-12 diesel engine produced under
license in the U.S. by General Dynamics \$130 million to develop the
high-energy laser anti-missile system (ongoing). While overall aid to
Israel is slated to decrease over the next five years, [[military aid
will increase significantly]{.underline}]{.mark}. One of President
Clinton's last acts was to sign an agreement with Israel, phasing out
the ESF by 2008. At the same time, FMF funds to Israel will increase
\$60 million each year, reaching \$2.4 billion by 2008. Free Weapons to

And what then? To put the question at its starkest: if circumstances
were to undergo a drastic change, and U.S.-Israel relations were to
suffer a nosedive, could Israel survive without the U.S. altogether? The
question is, of course, speculative, and very hard to answer in any
definitive manner. But, for argument's sake, let's entertain the
hypothesis. First of all, Israel itself, as a country, clearly could
survive the demise of the US. military-assistance program, which in the
mid-2010s constituted approximately 3 percent of the state budget and 1
percent of GDP: a painful but not insurmountable cut. Second, however,
for the defense budget, of which U.S. aid has constituted a hefty 17--20
percent in recent years---a sum equivalent to the Israeli military's
entire procurement budget---any such stoppage would deliver a severe
blow. Since, out of that overall defense budget, the allocation to the
IDF stands at a bit less than half, with the rest going to highly
expensive rehabilitation programs for the injured and compensation to
widows, pensions, and more, an end to American aid would be devastating
absent a major reordering of national priorities, with profound
ramifications for Israel's economy and society. The actual military
consequences would be even more severe with regard to the supply of
weapons, where Israel's dependence on the United States is critical.
Unlike the case with the Arabs, who can procure weapons from numerous
sources with few constraints, it is hard to imagine the other major arms
producers today---Britain, France, Russia, China---stepping in to take
America's place. Even assuming the political willingness to do so---a
highly questionable assumption---none would be willing to provide the
funding; nor is there any qualitative substitute for American arms.
Israel does manufacture (and export) a remarkable variety of munitions
on its own, but these are designed to fulfill unique operational needs.
Otherwise, there are only three exceptions to its reliance on weapons
systems from the U.S: it produces its own tanks, albeit equipped with
American engines, and buys submarines and missile boats from Germany.
Moreover, as we saw earlier, the U.S.-Israel military relationship
extends far beyond the supply of weapons to include the link to the
American warning system, bilateral and trilateral exercises, and even a
de-facto security guarantee. No other country can or would provide
Israel with such capabilities and assurances, and no other country would
have helped Israel build a rocket and missile shield---the only one of
its kind in the world---or (reportedly) engage with Israel in joint
offensive cyber operations. On the diplomatic level, too, there is no
alternative to the United States today. No other permanent member of the
Security Council would repeatedly use its veto to protect Israel from
sanctions, or provide diplomatic cover in virtually all international
forums, or even try to take a balanced position on the peace process. As
Israel's international isolation has grown, its dependence on the U.S.
diplomatic shield has become almost complete. In brief: economically,
were it forced to, Israel might somehow tough it out virtually alone in
a globalized world, but the adjustment would certainly be difficult and
require drastic domestic changes. Militarily and diplomatically, it
would be close to impossible. No one likes to be reliant on a foreign
power, even one as friendly and well-meaning toward Israel as the United
States. This, however, is the reality, and its implications for policy
need to be faced soberly.

[It is impossible to continue keeping 3.5 million Palestinians under
occupation]{.underline}---yes it is occupation, and [it is bad for
Israel ... Controlling 3.5 million Palestinians cannot go on
forever]{.underline} (Ariel Sharon, 26 December 2003). These two
statements by Israel's Prime Minister---made within the short space of
12 months---appear to represent an incredible political transformation.
They voice diametrically opposing views on Israel's intentions for the
occupied Palestinian territories. Can Sharon, the leader most associated
with aggressive control of the Palestinians, now be advocating the end
of Israeli colonialism? Moreover---unlike most other Israeli
leaders---Sharon has turned his intentions into concrete action by
recently leading Israel to a unilateral evacuation of 25 Jewish
settlements in the Gaza Strip and northern West Bank. This was the first
time that Israel willingly evacuated settlements from what it considers
the Jewish homeland, that is, Palestine/Eretz Yisrael, between Jordan
and the sea. How can we account for this transformation? Do these moves
actually herald the long-awaited crossing of the peace watershed? [[Are
we heading toward the end of Israeli colonialism]{.mark} as part of a
two-state solution?]{.underline} My answer in this short essay will be
[[negative]{.underline}]{.mark}. I will argue that the [recent [moves by
the]{.mark} Sharon [government]{.mark} are indeed significant, as they
point to a new phase in the evolving political geography of
Israel/Palestine and to [the continuing decline]{.mark} of the Greater
Israel agenda. However, [this change is unlikely to lead]{.mark} in the
foreseeable future [to the establishment of a viable Palestinian
state]{.mark}; rather, [it will entrench]{.mark} Israel/Palestine i[n a
state of "neither two states nor one,"]{.mark} framing a process I have
called "creeping apartheid."]{.underline} A New Phase The disengagement
was the last in a series of Israeli manoeuvres which have combined to
create a new phase of spatial politics, [best conceptualized as
"oppressive consolidation]{.underline}." The contours of this new phase
are complex, marked by a mixture of small territorial concessions
[[and]{.mark} the unilateral introduction of [new forms of
oppression]{.mark}]{.underline}. It follows decades of unabated Zionist
demographic and spatial expansionism, characterized by Jewish-only
immigration to Israel/Palestine, the construction of some 200 Jewish
settlements in the Occupied Territories and in Palestinian regions
within Israel, massive land confiscation, and uncompromising attempts to
Judaize the entire Israel/Palestine space. Transition to the new phase
occurred gradually, as a result of two violent intifadas, the failure of
peace talks, and growing pressure against Israel's illegal colonialism
in an increasingly antagonistic international environment. [In the early
1990s Israeli elites began to realize that further expansion bears high
military, economic, and social costs that runcounter to the rising
agendas of globalization and liberalization]{.underline}. Consequently,
[they launched a series of moves to consolidate major territorial and
political gains]{.underline}. These were often confused and
contradictory. They included [[aggressive policies]{.underline}]{.mark}
such as of a wave of new "outpost" settlement, [acc[elerated expansion
of]{.mark} existing [settlements]{.mark}]{.underline}, increased
"anti-terror" offensives, and the separation wall; during the same
period, however, Israel also recognized the Palestinian national
movement and the PLO, allowed the establishment of a Palestinian
state-inwaiting, and retreated (often temporarily) from the main
Palestinian towns and cities (and, most recently, from the entire Gaza
Strip). Significantly, this period saw the mainstream of Israeli society
moving to support territorial concessions. Yet---barring [the unlikely
imposition of [massive]{.mark} [international
pressure]{.mark}]{.underline}---this change [[is not sufficient to bring
an end to Israeli colonialism]{.underline}]{.mark}. Zionism remains a
deeply ethnocratic movement, premised on belief in its "historic right"
over the entire "promised homeland" (Palestine/Eretz Yisrael) and on the
associated Othering of the Palestinians. [This makes it unable to deal
seriously with the core issues of the conflict, such as]{.underline}
Israel's role in the 1948 Nakbah, Palestinian refugees, Jerusalem,
legitimate borders, and [the status of the Palestinians in Israel. [This
inability is wrapped in the Israeli discourse]{.mark} by ceaseless
public invocation of (often genuine) communal fears of anti-Jewish
violence and a distorted representation of Palestinian and Arab
intentions towards Israe]{.underline}l. These factors have stirred
Israel to adopt unilateralism as a key method of operation (see Meital
2005). Ethnocracy, Judaization, and Two States I have developed an
ethnocratic theory to account for regimes and societal processes found
in contested territories in which a dominant ethnic nation appropriates
the state apparatus to further its expansionist aspirations while
keeping some features of formal democracy. [[Ethnocratic states---such
as Israel---are typified by]{.underline}]{.mark} (internal and external)
[[colonial oppression of minorities]{.underline}]{.mark}, which
invariably resist this oppressive order. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark}
asymmetric dialectic [[tends to]{.underline}]{.mark} essentialize
identities and [[polarize spatial and political
systems]{.underline}]{.mark}. Examples of ethnocratic regimes include
Serbia, Estonia, Latvia, Sri Lanka, pre-1989 Lebanon, and 19th-century
Australia (see Yiftachel and Ghanem 2004). Significantly, the heart of
ethnocracy--- the ethnicization project---does not necessarily entail
territorial expansion. If the ethnic character of the state is under
threat, ethnocracies may contract geographically, preferring to guard
two fundamental tenets---ethnic dominance and a democratic facade---in
order to maintain internal and international legitimacy. In such cases,
the ethnicization force is applied internally, working to cement greater
political, cultural, and spatial control for the dominant group. This is
how the 2005 disengagement should be perceived: as assisting Israel's
Judaization project by ridding itself of a large Palestinian population,
thereby deepening Jewish control elsewhere in Israel/Palestine. The
[[disengagement sets an important precedent]{.mark} of removing Jewish
colonial settlements in Israel/Palestine]{.underline} and, as such, has
the potential to begin a new historical momentum toward complete
decolonization. [[But this outcome is unlikely]{.mark} in the near
future]{.underline}, for several major reasons. Geography The
disengagement should be analyzed not in isolation but as a "package"
with parallel Israeli moves to enlarge settlements and construct the
wall in the West Bank. Symbolically, these policies were approved by the
government in the same meeting in February 2005. Materially, the
geography of the West Bank has become increasingly fractured by the
growth of the settlement blocs, the checkpoint regime, gerrymandered
municipalseparation wall and a new Israeli strategy of creating "ethnic
roads." These oppressive measures were coupled with institutional and
military impediments to Arab economic development and housing
construction. Notably, this geography is dynamic. Israel may well
conduct further small "disengagements" by unilaterally evacuating remote
settlements, especially in the Nablus and Hebron areas. However, this is
not likely to alter the fundamental obstacles to creating a viable
Palestinian state; rather, it will function to ease Israel's problems of
managing Palestinian populations. Limited Israeli withdrawals will
accelerate a Bantustanization process, creating autonomous Palestinian
enclaves decorated by state symbols but with little genuine sovereignty
free of Israeli control (see also Falah 2005; Farsakh 2005). Violence
Israel's ethnocratic mindset and its associated unilateralism stand
behind a steadfast refusal to enter negotiations. T[his is likely to
[generate]{.mark} Palestinian anti-colonial activities, triggering state
[violence and terror against]{.mark} mobilized [Palestinians. Backed by
American interests in a supportive post-9/11 international
environment]{.mark}, Israeli measures include target assassinations,
occasional raids, and a range of controls over movement, housing
construction, and economic development.]{.underline} The Palestinians,
in turn, have used a persistent strategy of anti-Israeli violence and
terror propelled by the growing influence of radical Islam. This has had
disastrous consequences both for Palestinian democratization and for
Jewish--Palestinian trust---so necessary for building peace with a
Jewish public still traumatized by its own history of displacement and
genocide. Being embedded in Palestinian politics[, [violence]{.mark} is
likely to continue]{.underline}, notwithstanding the recent calming
efforts by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. [This will [create a
further Israeli "security need" to tighten control over the Palestinian
territories]{.mark}, fuelling further hostilities, [which would]{.mark}
seriously [impede]{.mark} genuine [progress toward the two-state
solution]{.mark}]{.underline}. Israeli Politics A new consensus is in
the making among Jews: Israel should control the area west of the
separation wall and wait for Palestinians to make the "necessary moves"
for peace (such as disarming Hamas and Islamic Jihad, stopping
incitement, and supporting further concessions, especially regarding the
Right of Return). This consensus has been aptly described as a paradigm
shift in the Jewish public from conflict resolution to conflict
management (Sussman 2005). It allows many Jews to perceive themselves as
"progressive" (by supporting the partition of the Land of Israel) while
at the same time preserving their privileged position. It should also be
remembered that, in the spectrum of Israeli politics, the nationalist
position that supports territorial concessions is considered "centrist."
The likely persistence of Palestinian violence, and the ethnocratic
discourse interpreting this violence solely as attempts to destroy
Israel (not simply to end the occupation), is likely to maintain solid
support for the Jewish fascist and religious Right. This bloc is likely
to form the main opposition to the Israeli government, which will likely
remain of centre-right colours (in Israeli terms). Despite possible
reconfiguration of the Israeli political landscape, in which new parties
often rise and fall, in terms of substance, there little hope for the
re-emergence of an influential peace-oriented Left. The Palestinian
citizens of Israel are pivotal here too. Support of their brethren in
the Occupied Territories and their campaign against the discriminatory
nature of the Israeli state was radicalized following the events of
October 2000 and the police killing of 13 unarmed Palestinian citizens
in stormy demonstrations during the outbreak of the second intifada.
Subsequent events have created a profound Arab--Jewish rift in Israeli
politics, impeding the creation of a left-of centre Arab--Jewish
political alliance. This political constellation, which is closely
associated with events in the Occupied Territories, leaves Israeli
politics wide open for control by ethnocratic parties and leaders for
the foreseeable future. Several elements may attempt to change the
political agenda to focus on social issues, but their impact is likely
to be limited. Therefore, [the likely dynamics of geography, [violence,
and politics in Israel]{.mark}/ Palestine [continue to present profound
impediments to the emergence of two viable states]{.mark}]{.underline}
based on the 1967 borders. But let us not be mistaken: [[No political
leader is likely to sing]{.mark} the epitaph of [the two-state
solution]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rather, [[they will continue to feed the
illusion of possible peace]{.mark}, while buttressing a "politics of
suspension," [placing the status of Palestinians in a perpetual]{.mark}
state of [uncertainty]{.mark}]{.underline} (see Azoulay and Ophir 2005).
[This state of suspension is [actively shaped by Israel]{.mark}i
policies]{.underline}, as clearly spelled out by Sharon's senior
advisor, Dov Weisglass: The significance of [the disengagement plan is
the freezing of the peace process]{.underline} ... \[we\] [prevent a
discussion on the refugees, the borders and Jerusalem]{.underline}.
Effectively, this whole package called the Palestinian state, with all
that it entails, has been removed indefinitely from our agenda. And all
this with authority and permission. [[All with a \[US\] presidential
blessing and the ratification of]{.mark} both houses of
[Congress]{.mark}]{.underline}. (qtd. in Shavit, Benn, and Ettinger

other countries primarily deal with the Department of Defense when
arranging to purchase military hardware from U.S. companies, Israel
deals directly with U.S. companies for the vast majority of its military

purchase amount per contract, but Israel is allowed to purchase military
items for far less, according to Berrigan.

Glick 10 \[Caroline B. Glick is the senior Middle East Fellow at the

"The Strategic

Foundations of the US-Israel Alliance," April 23, 2010,

<http://www.jewishworldreview.com/0410/glick042310.php3?printer_friendly>\]

Israel&#39;s status as the US&#39;s most vital ally in the Middle East
has been so widely recognized for so long that over the years, Israeli
and American leaders alike have felt it unnecessary to explain what it
is about the alliance that makes it so important for the US. Today, as
the Obama administration is openly distancing the US from Israel while
giving the impression that Israel is a strategic impediment to the
administration&#39;s attempts to strengthen its relations with the Arab
world, recalling why Israel is the US&#39;s most important ally in the
Middle East has become a matter of some urgency. Much is made of the
fact that Israel is a democracy. But we seldom consider why the fact
that Israel is a representative democracy matters. The fact that Israel
is a democracy means that its alliance with America reflects the will of
the Israeli people. As such, it remains constant regardless of who is
power in Jerusalem. All of the US&#39;s other alliances in the Middle
East are with authoritarian regimes whose people do not share the
pro-American views of their leaders. The death of leaders or other
political developments are liable to bring about rapid and dramatic
changes in their relations with the US. For instance, until 1979, Iran
was one of the US&#39;s closest strategic allies in the region. Owing to
the gap between the Iranian people and their leadership, the Islamic
revolution put an end to the US-Iran alliance. Egypt flipped from a
bitter foe to an ally of the US when Gamal Abdel Nasser died in 1969.
Octogenarian President Hosni Mubarak&#39;s encroaching death is liable
to cause a similar shift in the opposite direction. Instability in the
Hashemite kingdom in Jordan and the Saudi regime could transform those
countries from allies to adversaries. Only Israel, where the government
reflects the will of the people is a reliable, permanent US ally.
America reaps the benefits of its alliance with Israel every day. As the
US suffers from chronic intelligence gaps, Israel remains the US&#39;s
most reliable source for accurate intelligence on the US&#39;s enemies
in the region. Israel is the US&#39;s only ally in the Middle East that
always fights its own battles. Indeed, Israel has never asked the US for
direct military assistance in time of war. Since the US and Israel share
the same regional foes, when Israel is called upon to fight its enemies,
its successes redound to the US&#39;s benefit. Here it bears recalling
Israel&#39;s June 1982 destruction of Syria&#39;s Soviet-made
anti-aircraft batteries and the Syrian air force. Those stunning Israeli
achievements were the first clear demonstration of the absolute
superiority of US military technology over Soviet military technology.
Many have argued that it was this Israeli demonstration of Soviet
technological inferiority that convinced the Reagan administration it
was possible to win the Cold War. In both military and non-military
spheres, Israeli technological achievements - often developed with US
support - are shared with America. The benefits the US has gained from
Israeli technological advances in everything from medical equipment to
microchips to pilotless aircraft are without peer worldwide. Beyond the
daily benefits the US enjoys from its close ties with Israel, the US has
three fundamental, permanent, vital national security interests in the
Middle East. A strong Israel is a prerequisite for securing all of these
interests. America&#39;s three permanent strategic interests in the
Middle East are as follows: 1 - Ensuring the smooth flow of affordable
petroleum products from the region to global consumers through the
Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Aden and the Suez Canal. 2 - Preventing the
most radical regimes, sub-state and non-state actors from acquiring the
means to cause catastrophic harm. 3 - Maintaining the US&#39;s capacity
to project its power to the region. A strong Israel is the best
guarantor of all of these interests. Indeed, the stronger Israel is, the
more secure these vital American interests are. Three permanent and
unique aspects to Israel&#39;s regional position dictate this state of
affairs. 1 - As the first target of the most radical regimes and radical
sub-state actors in the region, Israel has a permanent, existential
interest in preventing these regimes and sub-state actors from acquiring
the means to cause catastrophic harm. Israel&#39;s 1981 airstrike that
destroyed Iraq&#39;s Osirak nuclear reactor prevented Iraq from
acquiring nuclear weapons. Despite US condemnation at the time, the US
later acknowledged that the strike was a necessary precondition to the
success of Operation Desert Storm ten years later. Richard Cheney - who
served as secretary of defense during Operation Desert Storm - has
stated that if Iraq had been a nuclear power in 1991, the US would have
been hard pressed to eject Saddam Hussein&#39;s Iraqi army from Kuwait
and so block his regime from asserting control over oil supplies in the
Persian Gulf. 2 - Israel is a non- expansionist state and its neighbors
know it. In its 62 year history, Israel has only controlled territory
vital for its national security and territory that was legally allotted
to it in the 1922 League of Nations Mandate which has never been
abrogated or superseded. Israel&#39;s strength, which it has used only
in self-defense, is inherently non-threatening. Far from destabilizing
the region, a strong Israel stabilizes the Middle East by deterring the
most radical actors from attacking. In 1970, Israel blocked Syria&#39;s
bid to use the PLO to overthrow the Hashemite regime in Jordan.
Israel&#39;s threat to attack Syria not only saved the Hashemites then,
it has deterred Syria from attempting to overthrow the Jordanian regime
ever since. Similarly, Israel&#39;s neighbors understand that its
purported nuclear arsenal is a weapon of national survival and hence
they view it as non-threatening. This is the reason Israel&#39;s alleged
nuclear arsenal has never spurred a regional nuclear arms race. In stark
contrast, if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, a regional nuclear arms race
will ensue immediately. Although they will never admit it, Israel&#39;s
non-radical neighbors feel more secure when Israel is strong. On the
other hand, the region&#39;s most radical regimes and non-state actors
will always seek to emasculate Israel. 3\-- Since as the Jewish state
Israel is the regional bogeyman, no Arab state will agree to form a
permanent alliance with it. Hence, Israel will never be in a position to
join forces with another nation against a third nation. In contrast, the
Egyptian-Syrian United Arab Republic of the 1960s was formed to attack
Israel. Today, the Syrian-Iranian alliance is an inherently aggressive
alliance against Israel and the non-radical Arab states in the region.
Recognizing the stabilizing force of a strong Israel, the moderate
states of the region prefer for Israel to remain strong. From the
US&#39;s perspective, far from impairing its alliance-making
capabilities in the region, by providing military assistance to Israel,
America isn&#39;t just strengthening the most stabilizing force in the
region. It is showing all states and non-state actors in the greater
Middle East it is trustworthy. On the other hand, every time the US
seeks to attenuate its ties with Israel, it is viewed as an
untrustworthy ally by the nations of the Middle East. US hostility
towards Israel causes Israel&#39;s neighbors to hedge their bets by
distancing themselves from the US lest America abandon them to their
neighboring adversaries. A strong Israel empowers the relatively
moderate actors in the region to stand up to the radical actors in the
region because they trust Israel to keep the radicals in check.
Today&#39;s regional balance of power in which the moderates have the
upper hand over the radicals is predicated on a strong Israel. On the
other hand, when Israel is weakened the radical forces are emboldened to
threaten the status quo. Regional stability is thrown asunder. Wars
become more likely. Attacks on oil resources increase. The most radical
sub-state actors and regimes are emboldened. To the extent that the
two-state solution assumes that Israel must contract itself to within
the indefensible 1949 ceasefire lines, and allow a hostile Palestinian
state allied with terrorist organizations to take power in the areas it
vacates, the two- state solution is predicated on making Israel weak and
empowering radicals. In light of this, the two-state solution as
presently constituted is antithetical to America&#39;s most vital
strategic interests in the Middle East. When we bear in mind the
foundations for the US&#39;s alliance with Israel, it is obvious that US
support for Israel over the years has been the most cost-effective
national security investment in post-World War II US history.

### Relationship

ZM

Israel is considered a prime example of settler colonialism - the
academic journal \"Settler Colonial Studies\" has had a number of issues
dedicated solely to the idea of Israel as a settler colonial
entity.Perhaps the father of the entire field of settler colonialism
isLorenzo [Veracini]{.underline}, and he wrote a paper in
\"Interventions : International Journal of Postcolonial Studies\"\[2\]
that [defended the idea of Israel as a paradigm of settler
colonialism.]{.underline}He brings two counterarguments and answers
them. [The first is nonsensical]{.underline}:To contextualize this
outline, I will begin with two oft-repeated statements.They are
routinely used [to deny that Zionism can be interpreted as an instance
of colonialism, let alone settler colonialism]{.underline}. The first
one asserts [Zionism cannot be considered settler colonialism because
such a rubric obscures its inherent specificity]{.underline}. I remain
unconvinced. It is like saying that Newton was wrong to think in
abstract terms and that his theory of gravitation was inappropriate
because it neglected the specific characteristics of a particular apple.
More to the point: abstracting does not rule out specific observation.
On the contrary, it is necessarily premised on it. At the same time,
[appraising Zionism and settler colonialism in the same interpretive
frame does not amount to saying that Zionism is just like other settler
colonialisms, or an imitation of previous iterations of this mode of
domination]{.underline}. This approach is primarily about Zionism\'s
relationship with the indigenous collective it encounters and how this
relationship reproduces the relationships other settler-colonial
projects establish with other indigenous collectives. It is a statement
of political geometry, not an exercise in morality. Indeed, it is not
even about a similarity between colonization movements but about a
relational similarity. It is not about comparing apples but about
comparing their falling. It may be a great apple, but the fact remains
that apple fell in Palestine If I were a Palestinian, I would develop a
keen interest in the physics of apples, but even if I were personally
committed to the project of settling in Palestine I would still be
interest in \'appledynamics.[Veracini fails to specify what exactly is
the specific nature of Zionism that might distinguish it from \"other\"
settler colonialisms]{.underline}, [claiming that it doesn\'t really
matter because it is in the end a discussion of the relationship between
Zionists and the \"indigenous collective]{.underline}.\" But that
characterization is itself biased, because [Zionism considers Jews to be
the indigenous population, that has been displaced throughout the
millennia from their land, especially from the destruction of the Temple
through the Muslim conquest, which is the time that Jews became a
minority. Yet there are no papers on the settler colonialism of the
Arabs of the 8th and 9th centuries CE]{.underline}. His next argument
claims to dispense with the one mentioned above, about the absence of
any metropole: The second statement I\'d like to address is about the
ostensible absence of a directly colonizing metropole. [Colonialism must
be performed for the benefit of a colonizing centre, it is argued. If it
is missing this direction, and Zionism is, as it relies on the
institutions of a diaspora rather than those of a colonizing
centre]{.underline} (even though it is crucially relying on the support
of colonial/imperial and neocolonial powers - the British during the
Mandate era and the United States afterwards), **[then it is not
colonialism]{.underline}**. [Others have countered this assertion by
pointing to Zionism\'s ability to rely on a \'diffusely integrated\' or
\'diffuse transnational\' metropole]{.underline} (Wolfe 2016, 228, 247),
[but for the purposes of this essay I\'d like to note that **settler
colonialism is crucially distinguished from colonialism** as a mode of
domination precisely because of the settlers\' collective ability to
subtract themselves from the supervisory control of an overbearing
metropolis while following an autonomous course]{.underline}. Triumphant
settlers are always emancipated from a colonizing metropole; they
famously declare their independence. The absence of a colonizing
national metropole, or the presence of a transnational one, is a shared
trait of settler-colonial phenomena, including Zionism, not a
distinguishing feature. These defenders of Zionism are actually arguing
that Zionism is not a colonial movement because it is a settler-colonial
one. They may be onto something, but do they want to be onto this
something?[The answer to this is that the very nature of Zionism is not
to be a colonizing movement but to be a national liberation movement -
**for Jews**]{.underline}.[By casting Jews as the colonialists - whether
traditional or settler-colonialist - the very basis of Zionism and
Jewish nationalism is **discarded a priori**]{.underline}. [Given that
Jews have remained connected to the land, both emotionally and
physically as many have returned throughout the last thousand years, the
belittling of the Jewish desire to return to Zion is at the most
charitable a huge blind spot, and at worst
**antisemitic**.]{.underline}A number of other arguments against Zionism
being settler-colonialist have been posited. Wikipedia \[3\]lists a few.
Perhaps the most cogent is this one:S. Ilan Troen, in \'De-Judaizing the
Homeland: Academic Politics in Rewriting the History of Palestine\',
argues that [Zionism was the repatriation of a long displaced indigenous
population to their historic homeland]{.underline}, and that \"[Zionists
did not see themselves as foreigners or conquerors, for centuries in the
Diaspora they had been strangers]{.underline}\". Troen further argues
that [there are several differences between European colonialism and the
Zionist movement]{.underline}, including that [\"there is no New Vilna,
New Bialystock, New Warsaw, New England, New York,\...and so
on\"]{.underline} in Israel. He writes that \"[mandates were intended to
nurture the formation of new states until independence and this
instrument was to be applied to Jews, even as it was for the Arab
peoples of Syria and Iraq.]{.underline} In this view, Jews were a people
not only entitled to a state but that polity was naturally located in a
part of the world in which they had originated, had been resident since
the ancient world, and still constituted a vital presence in many areas
of the region, including Palestine\" and that \"perhaps the most
manifest or visible evidence---for those who would be willing to
acknowledge---were found in the revival of Hebrew into a living
language; the marking the landscape with a Jewish identity; and the
development of an indigenous culture with roots in the ancient past.\"
He concludes that \"casting Zionists as colonizers serves to present
them as occupiers in a land to which, by definition, they do not
belong.\"Exactly. And beyond his excellent argument about there being no
\"New Nialystock\" in Israel - the communities that were built by Jews
were, by and large, given the very names that they had in Biblical
times, names that in many cases had been replaced by Arabic
equivalents - of the Arab colonizers.Veracini has one point. [The Jews
who returned to Israel did often look at themselves as being superior to
the Arab population in Palestine]{.underline}, [and in that narrow sense
there may be something to be learned from cases **of settler-colonialism
in the US**]{.underline} or Canada.One answer is that early [Zionists
always envisioned a society where the undeniable Jewish superiority in
technology, politics, and industry would positively affect the local
Arabs, a rising tide that would lift all peopl]{.underline}e. [One would
be hard-pressed to find any early Zionist writings that encouraged
ethnic cleansing of Arabs of the type done in the US to native
Americans]{.underline}. **[Jewish boys aren\'t playing an Arab-Israeli
version of \"Cowboys and Indians]{.underline}**.\" The biggest exodus of
Arabs came about from a war that was meant to wipe out the Jews. In 1948
there was never the intent to drive most of the Arabs out - although in
a minority of cases that indeed happened - most left because of panic
and the lies that the Arabs would win so they can return.[At any rate,
positioning Israel as a settler colonialist state indeed is]{.underline}
a moral position - one that claims that Jews somehow don\'t belong in
their ancestral lands. And that is **[a bigoted position to take, no
matter what the intention]{.underline}**.Play Video\[4\] We have lots of
ideas, but we need more resources to be even more effective.

### Water Impact 

#### No water crisis -- Israel is solving issues now

Akiva **Bigman 14** (Akiva Bigman is deputy editor at Mida, has an M.A.
in Jewish History from Bar Ilan University)., April 2014, \"The Myth of
the Thirsty Palestinian,\"

accessed 6-26-2019 TimH

[The issue of [water rights]{.mark}]{.underline} in the West Bank [is
constantly raised]{.underline} in regard to the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict, appearing again and again in public discourse around the
world. According to critics of Israel, the Jewish state selfishly
exploits the area's water supplies and denies access to the local
population. In doing so, the critics say, Israel is not only abandoning
its responsibilities to the West Bank Palestinians, but ruthlessly and
illegally abusing the natural resources of the occupied territory. This
idea has become extremely widespread in the international media, and was
recently voiced from the Knesset plenum by the President of the European
Parliament, Martin Schulz, causing a minor scandal in Israel and abroad.
As with all attacks on Israel, [the truth [is much more
complicated]{.mark} and, to a great extent, precisely the
opposite]{.underline} of what the critics claim. When one examines the
relevant data, it becomes clear that, under Israeli rule[, [the
Palestinian water supply has become larger, more technologically
sophisticated, of higher quality, and much easier to
access;]{.underline}]{.mark} [almost entirely [due to Israeli
efforts]{.mark}.]{.underline} The truth is, most of the claims made
against Israel on this issue are nothing but empty propaganda. They are
based on claims that are simply untrue and/or based on a lack of basic
knowledge of the topography of Israel and the West Bank. The latter in
particular often creates total confusion in regard to everything
connected to the legal issues surrounding West Bank water sources, and
especially its important underground aquifers. To avoid such confusion,
this article is largely based on statistics published by the Israeli
Water Authority, and research by Professor Haim Gvirtzman, a hydrologist
from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Hopefully, it will give a much
more accurate picture of one of the most contentious disputes in the
current Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [[The attacks on Israeli
misuse]{.mark} of West Bank water supplies are based on three central
myths, all of which [are based on inaccurate]{.mark} and often deceptive
[claims]{.mark}. The first myth is that Palestinians now have less
access to water]{.underline} than they did in the past because of
Israeli rule over the West Bank, [violating the Palestinians' human
rights.]{.underline} In fact, like many of the claims this article will
deal with, [the opposite is the truth. [Before Israel took
control]{.mark} of the West Bank]{.underline} after the 1967 Six-Day
War, [[the West Bank's water system was primitive]{.underline}]{.mark}
in the extreme. [Much of it was based on technology dating as far back
as ancient Roman times]{.underline}, using aqueducts that operated by
the force of gravity and sporadic wells dug on an individual or communal
basis. Water was often transported by hand. Only a handful of places,
such as Ramallah, used a modern pumping system---built during the
British Mandate---and water was piped into a very small number of
private homes. At the end of Jordanian rule in 1967, the West Bank
Palestinians received a relatively low 65 million cubic meters of water
per year. Whatever the [depredations of the Israeli
occupation]{.underline} may have been, there is no doubt that they [did
not apply to the issue of water supplies. [Within]{.mark} five years of
[the Israeli takeover]{.mark}]{.underline} in 1967, [[the water supply
grew by 50 percent]{.underline}]{.mark}; and [the IDF]{.underline}
Civilian Administration, which rules over the territory, [[established a
pumping system]{.underline}]{.mark} that brought water directly to city
centers, where residents could fill water containers for personal use.
[This was [followed by]{.mark} the creation of a [modern
infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline} to supply water to the population of
the West Bank. It is true that, initially[, this was [because of]{.mark}
the [Israel]{.mark}i settlement movement]{.underline}. In order to
supply water to these new communities, a pumping infrastructure was
built throughout the territory and connected to the National Water
Carrier in Israel proper. But [this new infrastructure]{.underline} did
not only supply Israeli settlements. It also [serviced surrounding
Palestinian areas]{.underline}, bringing a noticeable improvement in
their standard of living. Whatever the circumstances under which this
infrastructure was built, its results cannot be denied: Up to the
signing of the Oslo Accords the Palestinian [[water]{.mark} supply
[doubled]{.mark}]{.underline}, reaching approximately 120 million cubic
meters per year by the time the interim agreements were signed in 1995.
[Since]{.underline} then, [[it]{.mark} has [almost doubled again. In
2010]{.mark}]{.underline}, the Civil Administration reported consumption
at 190 million cubic meters per year. Official Palestinian publications
have acknowledged this. In 2004, according to the Palestinian Hydrology
Group, there were 643 cities and towns connected to the water system,
out of 708 Palestinian settlements. Taken together, 97 percent of the
Palestinian population was connected to the territory's water system;
for the most part, directly to their own homes. In terms of per capita
consumption, there has also been substantial improvement. In 1967, per
capita consumption stood at 93,000 liters per year. In 2006, it stood at
129,000 liters per year, close to the average in Israel proper---170,000
liters per year. \*(Graph Omitted)\* Even after the Oslo Accords, Israel
continued its involvement in the Palestinian water system. [According to
the Accords, [Israel]{.mark} is required to supply 31 million cubic
meters per year to the Palestinians. It]{.underline} seems, however,
that Israel has exceeded this by a considerable degree. According to
statistics published by the Israeli Water Authority in 2012, Israel has
[[added]{.underline}]{.mark} no less than [[53.3 million cubic meters
per year to the Palestinian water]{.mark} supply.]{.underline} \*(Graph
Omitted)\* Whatever one may think of Israeli rule over the West Bank,
[there seems little question---even among the Palestinians
themselves---that [in terms of water supplies, Israeli succeeded]{.mark}
in doing in 30 years what the British Mandate and the Jordanian kingdom
failed to do. The second myth holds that the entire water supply of the
West Bank belongs to the Palestinians]{.underline}, making any use of
this water by Israel a violation of international law. Since Israel is
an occupying power, say the critics, it is illegal for it to make use of
the occupied territories' natural resources, including water. [This
claim is both hugely simplistic and shows a basic ignorance of
international law]{.underline}. It is clear even to the average person
that [[water is]{.mark} not like other natural resources, such as
land]{.underline}. There is a simple reason for this: Water tends to
move. [It is [a dynamic resource]{.mark}]{.underline} and rarely stays
in one place. Due to the complications inherent in laying claim to such
a resource, [[international law has not reached a consensus on the
issue]{.mark}.]{.underline} Water supplies in Israel and the West Bank
illustrate the complexity of this problem quite well. For example,
rainwater falling on the hills of Shechem drains into Israel's coastal
plain---within the '67 lines---and from there into the Mediterranean
Sea. Who does this water belong to? To even begin to answer this
question, it is important to know the topography of the area in
question. Most of the West Bank is hilly, while much of pre-1967 Israel
is flat and low, especially the Sharon Plain and the Negev
Desert---which includes the Dead Sea, the lowest place on Earth. As a
result of this, most of the rain that falls on the high ground of the
West Bank, such as the hills of Samaria, flows down into the northern
Jezreel Valley and then into Israel's western central plain. This
rainfall supplied much of Israel's water even before the Six-Day War. In
the same way, groundwater accumulated in the West Bank tends to flow
downwards and collect in wells located on lower ground, again on
territory located in Israel proper. As a result, a large amount of the
water originating in the West Bank has ultimately arrived in Israel as a
result of entirely natural forces. Taking all of this into
consideration, one can begin to understand the issue of West Bank water
rights in light of international law. Although, as noted above, no legal
consensus on the subject exists, several basic principles have been
adopted. [[Because water is often a highly contentious issue, the
intention behind these principles is to avoid or minimize
conflict]{.mark} over water sources]{.underline}. Although they are not
binding in a practical sense, [[they do constitute a useful starting
point]{.mark}.]{.underline} In essence, there are three basic principles
involved: [1. [Preference is given to the party that has historically
held the rights]{.mark} to the water supply in question, as well as the
party most dependent on it. 2. [Unused water sources must be developed
before any redistribution]{.mark} of resources takes place. 3. [Waste
must be minimized]{.mark} and use of the water source must be optimized
before any redistribution of resources takes place.]{.underline} As
noted above, the topography of the West Bank is such that, due to
natural forces, the majority of its water has always ended up in Israeli
hands, and this was the case long before the occupation of the West
Bank. When we examine the table below, which presents the historical
water consumption from each of the three aquifers in millions of cubic
meters per year, it becomes clear that [[Israel's historic right]{.mark}
to the majority of the water [has been long
established]{.mark}.]{.underline} \*(Graph Omitted)\* What about unused
water sources? The majority of this is located in the eastern aquifer,
which flows beneath the Jordan Valley. It contains approximately 70
million cubic meters of water a year that is left unused. The rights to
this water were granted to the Palestinians under the Oslo Accords.
Unfortunately, the Palestinians have yet to exercise these rights to any
significant degree, and the failure do so is entirely their own. For
example, over 40 potential drilling sites in the Hebron area were
identified and approved by the Israeli-Palestinian Joint Water
Committee; but in the two decades since then, drilling has taken place
in only three places, and this is in spite of substantial funding
provided to the PA by donor nations. This is both tragic and ironic,
because undertaking these drilling projects could entirely solve the
area's current water issues; instead, [[the Palestinians have chosen to
both blame Israel for their water problems]{.mark} and drill into the
Western aquifer, which provides water to Israel.]{.underline} In regard
to waste and optimal use of water sources, it is also clear that [[the
Palestinians]{.mark} are very far from fulfilling the most basic
requirements of international law]{.underline}. Because the [PA
[do]{.mark}es [not properly maintain its water system]{.mark}, it
suffers from a 33 percent rate of water loss, mostly due to leakage; in
contrast to an 11 percent loss from the Israeli system]{.underline}. In
addition, a large percentage of Palestinian agriculture uses surface
irrigation, a primitive and wasteful technology profoundly unsuited to
the region's limited water sources. The use of more efficient methods,
such as drip or sprinkler irrigation, as well as better water
purification and distribution, would both conserve resources and free up
a much larger amount of fresh water for home use---according to the
Israeli Water Authority, as much as 10 million cubic meters. It seems,
then, that [[Israel's critics are]{.mark} not only [wrong]{.mark}, but
entirely ignorant of the accepted principles of international
law]{.underline}. According to these principles, [[Israel holds the
majority of water]{.mark} in the West Bank [by right]{.mark}; the
Palestinians do not make proper use of their existing water sources; nor
do they make the required attempts to exploit untapped resources. And
none of this is due to Israeli malfeasance.]{.underline} The third and
final myth accuses Israel of polluting the aquifers beneath the West
Bank and destroying other water sources, thus wantonly destroying the
area's ecology. Perhaps more than any other, this claim is so completely
untrue that it could only be made by someone without any knowledge of
the facts whatsoever. The truth is, again, precisely the opposite. While
most [Israeli [wastewater is purified]{.mark} in modern sewage treatment
plants, most [Palestinian wastewater is discharged into the
environment]{.mark}, causing very serious pollution]{.underline}. Out of
52 million cubic meters per year of Palestinian wastewater, only 4
million is treated in Palestinian facilities; another 14 million is
treated in facilities established by Israel; the rest---approximately 34
million cubic meters a year---is left to pollute the environment. It is
important to understand that, because of the area's topography, [this
wastewater often flows into Israel proper, [and thus causes serious
damage to Israel's own water supplies]{.mark}, as well as the
surrounding environment]{.underline}. In particular, major damage has
been done to the Kishon River in the north, which feeds into the bay of
Haifa; the Alexander River, which flows into the Mediterranean Sea near
Hadera; the Kidron River, which stretches from Jerusalem to the Dead
Sea; and the Hebron River, which descends into the valley where
Beersheva is located and from there into the sea. As a result, [the
quality of life for everyone living near these rivers has been
damaged]{.underline}. But first and foremost, [[the environmental damage
the Palestinians have caused]{.mark} has harmed themselves, [as they
have]{.mark} been forced to [close]{.mark} more and more [wells]{.mark}
due to pollution.]{.underline} It is difficult to see how the
Palestinians can blame anyone for this but themselves, since donor
nations have provided \$130 million specifically earmarked for sewage
treatment. \*(Graph Omitted)\* Up to now, however, the Palestinians have
invested only NIS 25 million (approx. \$7.2 million) in building one
sewage treatment plant in al-Birah. Moreover, the Palestinians have not
accepted the offer of an additional \$300 million for building such
plants. As a result, the damage to the ecology of both Israel and the
West Bank is only getting worse. There is no doubt that the Palestinians
have no positive sentiments toward the Israeli occupation of the West
Bank, nor can they be expected to. Israel and its supporters, however,
should not accept every single criticism made of the Israeli presence in
the West Bank on this basis. [Accusations must be backed up by solid
fact]{.underline} and placed in their proper historical context in order
to be legitimate. [[The issue of water rights]{.mark}, supplies, and
infrastructure, [is]{.mark} perhaps the most [glaring example of
illegitimate criticism]{.mark}.]{.underline} On this issue, fact and
context have been entirely dispensed with in order to make Israel look
as bad as possible. In fact, as has been demonstrated above, [Israel's
record on water issues is a good one; it has consistently acted within
its rights and according to accepted legal conventions. Moreover, it is
clear that the Palestinians' record is a bad one; and it is they, not
Israel, who have failed to live up to their obligations under
international law.]{.underline} To the extent that a viable water supply
[infrastructure exists]{.underline} in the West Bank, it is [because
Israel built and maintained it]{.underline}. While this infrastructure
was certainly constructed, in part, to service Israeli communities,
[[its benefits have not been denied]{.mark} to the
Palestinians]{.underline}, and no one familiar with the statistics
involved can claim otherwise without being patently dishonest. That
Israel is so consistently blamed for this problem is especially
problematic because it makes it less likely that the Palestinians will
deal with it themselves. As shown above, [the [Palestinians have the
ability to]{.mark} both [live up to their obligations under
international law and solve their existing]{.mark} water
[problems]{.mark} in doing so.]{.underline} The money, technology, and
knowledge they need all exist and are available to them from both
foreign and Israeli sources. That the Palestinians have either chosen
not to avail themselves of such aid or cannot do so effectively due to
internal problems is tragic, but it is not the fault of the State of
Israel.

## Refugees 

#### They are better off in Israel than Libya

studied at the University of Ghana., APR 7, 2019 times of Israel: The
world has abandoned refugees in Libya to die
<https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/the-world-has-abandoned-refugees-in-libya-to-die/>(JR)

[last Thursday, Field Marshal Khalifa Belqasim Haftar declared his goal
to conquer the Libyan capital]{.underline} of Tripoli, and [began his
advance](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/04/libya-hafter-halt-de-escalate-advance-tripoli-190406054332606.html) shortly
thereafter. At this time, the militia forces has reached just outside
the city where several detention centers dot the landscape. But these
are not prisons for tried and charged criminals. Instead, these are
centers holding hundreds --- in some cases thousands --- of asylum
seekers. In 2017, Italy, backed by the EU, signed a deal with Libya to
stem migration by funding the [Libyan coast guard to intercept refugees
trying to cross the sea and hold them indefinitely in makeshift prisons.
Since this deal, asylum seekers from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Sudan and
Somalia have become some of the world's most severe victims of abuse,
extortion, slavery and torture at the hands of the Libyan
forces.]{.underline} Although [the UN has carried out a number of
successful evacuations, most going to Israel,]{.underline} approximately
5,700 refugees still populate these prisons and these numbers continue
to grow. Asylum seekers continue trying to traverse Libya and cross the
Mediterranean, not because they are unaware of the dangers, but because
their fates have been sealed back home due to war, political
persecution, genocide and religious oppression. Their lives in their
home countries have been scorched, and there is no way for them to
return safely. Past clashes between [the Libyan authorities and rebel
militias have cut asylum seekers off from all forms of aid, and guards
were left unable to reach the detention centers]{.underline}. This
resulted in massive food and water shortages and centers would often
lose electricity for days at a time. Despite these life-threatening
conditions, the surrounding fighting made it impossible for them to
flee. Since there is no government to protect them, they were left
vulnerable to militias who frequently raided the centers to find slave
laborers and human shields. Now, as Field Marshal Haftar's forces
advance, history is repeating itself once more. And again, [the world
has abandoned these men, women and children to die.]{.underline}This is
not the first time myself and other activists, journalists and aid
workers have received a wave of desperate of text messages from refugees
trapped inside Libya. [For months, a network of dedicated allies have
been collecting testimonies of a life of torture, deprivation of food
and water, forced labor, and utter despair in prisons]{.underline}. Just
this weekend, I was sent a text message that a one-month-old infant from
the Darfur region of Sudan had passed away over a day earlier. He had
fallen ill and the prison guard ignored the mother's plea for help when
the child stopped breathing. Because of the fighting outside there was
no way to bury the body. In January during the last bout of militia
fighting, refugees were cut off from food, water and electricity for
days and distributed protest photos (including the one above) across
social media trying to get someone from the outside to see them and to
listen. Over the past few months journalists have struggled to get media
outlets to publish the personal testimonies from these detainees but
because it is not a "hot topic" there's little will to publish the words
of an innocent young man who fled genocide in Darfur to reach Libya,
only to spend more than two years being imprisoned and tortured at the
hands of smugglers and militias. But for years their cries have fallen
on deaf ears, and as a result the status quo has transitioned from human
rights abuses to potential war crimes. Detainees are now stating that
the militias have entered the detention centers and, as Sally Hayden
reports in the [Irish
Times](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/africa/gen-khalifa-haftar-s-forces-close-in-on-tripoli-1.3851141),
have begun dressing refugees in old military uniforms. My contacts in
Qaser Bin Ghashir prison confirm that they are terrified of being forced
to fight alongside the militia. Whether that fear materializes or if
they continue to be used as slave labor or human shields, this has
crossed a new line. The 1949 Geneva Convention outlines that wearing an
enemy uniform marks someone as a "belligerent actor" which marks them as
a viable target; meaning, if refugees are forced out into the open air
dressed as militia fighters they can be targeted and killed by the
opposing side without recourse. At this time, Qaser Bin Ghashir prison
has lost electricity and detainees have run out of food and running
water. They report that they can still hear the sounds of the militias
fighting around them, making it unsafe to attempt to escape. The clock
has begun to tick for the survival of these men, women and children.
Each one of us has the power to amplify this message to try and reach a
critical mass of public opinion. Perhaps if there were [an outcry from
readers across the Western world; a twitter storm, a petition with tens
of thousands of signatures, or if people called their elected leaders
and demanded they intervene, then there may be a chance to pressure the
Libyan military to carry out evacuations to relocate the centers to
safer areas outside the city, or provide them with a channel to legally
apply for asylum in a safe country For the time being, refugees in these
detention centers have resigned themselves to an uncertain fate. They
have come to terms with the stark fact that the international community
is not going to come to their rescue. As one man put it, "this is not
the first \[or\] second time, it is a series of conflicts that we are
often victims of. We are held in \[hunger\] and can not do anything, no
help from anyone, no one can reach us now."]{.underline}

After the weekend's fighting between Hamas and Israel, some [**Israelis
have raised questions about** the strength of **their country's**
missile **defenses**.]{.underline} Over the course of the weekend,
[**[Hamas and Islamic Jihad launched]{.mark}** nearly 700
[rockets]{.mark} and mortars at Israel, [killing four]{.mark} people and
injuring more than 200. [Israel's Iron Dome]{.mark} missile defense
system [intercepted 240 of the 690]{.mark} projectiles]{.underline}
fired from Gaza. [[The number]{.mark} of rockets that [Iron Dome failed
to interce]{.mark}pt]{.underline} and the four Israeli fatalities
[[sparked inquiry about]{.mark} the [effectiveness]{.mark} of the
missile defense system]{.underline}, and whether [[Hamas and Islamic
Jihad]{.mark} have [found a way to thwart the system]{.mark}.
Hamas]{.underline} was quick to declare that it [had achieved victory
[by overwhelming Israeli defenses with]{.mark} concentrated barrages of
projectiles]{.underline}. "The Qassam Brigades, thanks to God, succeeded
in overcoming the so-called Iron Dome by adopting the tactic of firing
dozens of missiles in [[one]{.mark} single [burst]{.mark}]{.underline},"
a spokesman for Hamas's Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades said in a social
media post. "The high intensity of fire and the great destructive
ability of the missiles that were introduced by the Qassam \[Brigades\]
... [succeeded in [causing]{.mark} great losses and
[destruction]{.mark}]{.underline} to the enemy." The number of Israeli
civilians killed in the two-day conflict was only one fewer than during
2014's Operation Protective Edge, a struggle of nearly two months, when
Palestinian factions lobbed more than 4,500 projectiles at Israeli
cities. At the time, the Israel Defense Forces said that its Iron Dome
batteries had managed to knock down [90 percent]{.underline} of the
rockets within their coverage zones --- a [rate of success]{.underline}
which [was disputed by some critics.]{.underline} The IDF claimed a
similar level of success this time, too, telling reporters that it had
achieved an 86% success rate and that only 35 projectiles landed in
populated areas. However, Maj. Gen. Yaakov Amidror, a former national
security adviser and retired head of the Military Intelligence's
Research Department, said [[Iron Dome had gaps]{.mark} in its coverage,
especially when it came to short-range rockets landing within a few
kilometers of the border.]{.underline} "We [don't have enough time to
intercept it]{.underline}," he told the Jerusalem Post. Amidor also said
that in the case of a car hit by an anti-tank missile near Kibbutz Yad
Mordechai on Sunday, killing its Israeli driver, [Iron Dome wouldn't
have helped.]{.underline} "From the point of view of the system, this
was an open area without people. We don't intercept such rockets," he
said. A former deputy military intelligence chief, Brig. Gen. Meir
Elran, said that while "Iron Dome has proven to be an effective means of
saving lives, which also improves the flexibility of decision makers in
Israel," it is clear that [[the system]{.mark} as currently constituted
[cannot provide Israel with sufficient protection]{.mark} in the event
of a wider conflict.]{.underline} In an article published by the
Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv several weeks before
the outbreak of hostilities, Elran warned that "[the number of available
[batteries]{.mark}]{.underline} (some operated by reservists) [[cannot
suffice as a response]{.mark} to the threat]{.underline}, even one
characterized by sporadic fire [against]{.underline} the
[Israel]{.underline}i depth. [In a full-scale conflict]{.underline} the
\[Iron Dome\] system would be required to cover primarily military
installations and vital national infrastructures," which would mean that
[there would be gaps in the system's coverage of residential
areas.]{.underline} "During a broad and protracted conflict," Elran
wrote, [there is a "danger of multiple, simultaneous events that stretch
the capacity of response systems]{.underline}." The IDF has been beefing
up its systems. The business daily Globes reported that the army has
been working on improvements to Iron Dome intended to deal with just the
kinds of barrages used over the weekend, as well as against the kinds of
short-range projectiles used to target communities along the Gaza
border. In mid-April, the IDF concluded an air defense exercise
combining its Iron Dome and Patriot missile batteries.

Times of Israel reported. The video purportedly shows how [[the group
overcame Iron Dome during]{.mark} the round of clashes in
[May]{.mark}]{.underline}. \"We employed [the tactic of [massive
launches]{.mark} toward a single target to over[come the Iron

\"[The heaviest fire was used after \[Israel\] hit high-rise

according to The Times of Israel. In mid-May, the Israel Defence Forces

the 4 May massive missile attack from Gaza, [with [690 rockets
launched]{.mark} over the course of the next 2 days]{.underline},
according to IDF. As it was observed at the time [[the Iron Dome failed
to intercept all]{.mark} of the targets for a variety of
reasons]{.underline}. Among the latter was the [close range]{.underline}
from which the rockets were fired, [[giving]{.mark} the [Iron
Dome]{.mark} next to [no time to react]{.mark} and intercept
them]{.underline}, as it was explained at the time by the former head of
Military Intelligence\'s Research Department, Yaakov Amidror. Another
reason, according to Amidror, was [that [the Iron Dome\'s design makes
it ignore projectiles]{.mark} aimed at areas deemed empty or uninhabited
by the system]{.underline}. After the early May attack, the IDF
conducted strikes on Hamas and Islamic Jihad infrastructure in Gaza,
hitting 350 targets over the course of 48 hours. The Israeli military
retorted destroying Hamas\' operations planning headquarters, weapon
manufacturing factories, ammunition depots, and rocket launch sites.

[[Israel's Iron Dome]{.underline}]{.mark} is more than a missile defense
system. It's practically an icon, a symbol of how technological
creativity can enable one rocket to knock another rocket out of the sky.
But did the system [[fail earlier this month]{.underline}]{.mark}? And
what does this mean for the U.S. military's planned buy of Iron Dome?
[Any [thoughts of an invulnerable]{.mark} missile [shield evaporated
when Hamas fired]{.mark} six-hundred-and-ninety [rockets]{.mark} and
mortar shells from Gaza [into Israel]{.mark} earlier this
month]{.underline}. Out of that six-hundred-and-ninety total, ninety
never managed to cross into Israel, [according to Israeli
figures](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/gazas-homemade-rockets-still-stretch-israels-sophisticated-defenses/2019/05/06/2ca3a46a-700c-11e9-9331-30bc5836f48e_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.a98ad5a39444).
[Iron Dome intercepted two-hundred-and-forty]{.underline}, of which the
Israel Defense Forces claim an 86 percent kill rate, with [[thirty-five
rockets landing in populated areas. Critics have qestioned the accuracy
of the]{.mark} IDF's [Iron Dome statistics]{.mark}]{.underline} during
the 2014 Gaza conflict. But with four Israeli civilians dead (though one
was hit by an anti-tank missile fired directly from Gaza), even
[Israelis are [expressing
doubts](https://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/700-rockets-4-dead-Israelis-Is-the-Iron-Dome-getting-worse-589115)]{.underline}
about the system. [[Hamas]{.underline}]{.mark} says it [[deliberately
fired enormous numbers]{.mark} of rockets]{.underline} at a specific
target zone [[to saturate Iron Dome]{.underline}.]{.mark} Some Israeli
experts agree that [[it is difficult to defend]{.mark} against massed
salvoes with short flight times]{.underline} when fired from launchers
situated a few miles away in Gaza. Israel has ten Iron Dome batteries of
three launchers each, firing ten-foot-long Tamir interceptors that cost
about \$100,000 apiece. Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed force in Lebanon,
has an estimated 130,000 rockets. However, assessing the effectiveness
of Iron Dome isn't easy. For example, the software is supposed to
calculate whether a rocket will land in a populated area or empty
terrain: interceptors will hit the former while ignoring the latter. So,
if a Hamas rocket landed on Israel, was it because Iron Dome failed to
intercept it, or Iron Dome chose to ignore it because it didn't pose a
threat? Ted Postol, professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and a longtime critic of Israeli and American missile
defense, said [Youtube
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcNE5VHLldY) of [Iron Dome
[[interceptions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcNE5VHLldY) showed the
system isn't working]{.mark}. To hit and destroy the
warhead]{.underline}, rather than the missile fuselage, [an Iron Dome
interceptor must strike a rocket head-on]{.underline}, according to
Postol. The video that shows contrails from interceptors doing U-turns,
or diving down on their target, indicates that [[the interceptor did not
destroy]{.mark} the [warhead]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Postol
[dismiss]{.mark}ed the IDF's claim of an [86 percent interception rate.
"5 to 10 percent is more likely]{.mark}]{.underline}," he said. "It's
not Iron Dome. It's Iron Sieve." The latest performance of Iron Dome,
first deployed in 2011 and used extensively against Hamas rockets in the
2014 Israel-Gaza conflict, will interest the [U.S. Marine
Corps](https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/your-marine-corps/2019/05/07/the-marine-corps-has-been-looking-at-israels-iron-dome-air-defense-system/).
The Marines are considering whether to purchase Iron Dome to defend
against rocket attacks. Iron Dome has also been mentioned as a
possibility for the U.S. Army. But the most important question is what
Iron Dome's latest combat record means for strategic missile defense.
**[[Hamas's]{.mark} saturation [tactics illustrate]{.mark} the

[[The rivalry between America and China has seen]{.mark} both sides
[step up international arms sales]{.mark} and transfers as they seek to
strengthen military ties]{.underline} with key allies, according to a
report published on Monday. The study by the Stockholm International
Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), which examined the volume of
international transfers of major weapons between 2008 and 2017, showed
[[China's]{.mark} arms [exports]{.mark}]{.underline} represented 5.7 per

[[China unveiled an 8.]{.mark}1 [per cent increase in military
spending]{.mark} over a three-year period]{.underline}, although China's
state media defended the rise as proportionate and low, adding that it
would not lead to an arms race with the United States. The

in the Himalayas. "This development is part of the growing strategic
partnership between the two countries under which the USA has begun to
supply India with advanced military equipment," the report said. The US
has also started to increase its security cooperation with Vietnam,
which is embroiled in a dispute with Beijing over the South China Sea.
In 2017 it delivered one patrol ship, the USS Morgenthau, to Vietnam --
the first major US arms transfer to that country. Tensions between China
and Japan in the East China Sea also saw Japan moving closer to the US,
the report said. It said Tokyo turned to the US for several types of
advanced weapons between 2013 and 2017, including the first batches of a
total of 42 combat aircraft. Japan also ordered advanced air and missile
defence systems from the US in the same period. But [in cases where US
relations with other countries had deteriorated the result was a fall in
arms transfers.]{.underline} For example, the report said that
[[Venezuela, which once relied on the US as its main arms supplier, had
rebuilt its armed forces with weapons from China and Russia after ties
with Washington soured]{.underline}]{.mark} following the Hugo Chavez's
election as president in 1999. [As [China became increasingly capable of
producing its own]{.mark} advanced [weapons]{.mark}, its [arms exports
increased by 38 per cent]{.mark} and its arms imports decreased by 19
per cent]{.underline} in 2013-2017 compared with 2008-2012. The report
showed [[China delivered major arms to 48 countries in the past five
years]{.underline}]{.mark}, with Pakistan topping the list, followed by
Bangladesh and Algeria. "China was the largest arms supplier to Pakistan
in 2008--12 and 2013--17. Although the volume of China's arms exports to
Pakistan remained roughly the same in both periods, its share of
Pakistan's arms imports rose from 45 per cent in 2008--12 to 70 per cent
in 2013--17 due to the overall decrease in Pakistan's arms imports
between those periods," the report stated.

But [[each side had an interest in working with the
other]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution,
[[China began embracing]{.mark} capitalism and opening up trade to [the
West]{.mark}]{.underline} (the U.S. was on the verge of restoring ties
to Beijing). And [[with the Iranian revolution underway, Israel had lost
one of its primary arms customers. China]{.mark}, Israeli leaders hoped,
could [fill that vacuum]{.mark}. The]{.underline} man leading the effort
was Saul Eisenberg, a [Jewish]{.underline} billionaire who, like 20,000
other Holocaust refugees, had fled to Shanghai after World War II.
Eisenberg later built [a financial empire]{.underline} in the Far East,
becoming one of the first Westerners to do business in China, Japan and
Korea. He [used these ties to interest China in Israeli
weaponry]{.underline} and even donated his private plane to transport
the Israeli delegation on that maiden flight to Beijing in 1979.
Eisenberg was familiar with [[Israeli defense]{.underline}]{.mark}
products from other [deals]{.underline} he had [[helped broker]{.mark}
throughout [Asia]{.mark}]{.underline}. After a series of preliminary
meetings with the Chinese, he returned to Israel with a shopping
list---an unorganized mix of missiles, radar, artillery shells and
armor---and urged that the government send a delegation. Prime Minister
Menachem Begin approved the trip but deferred questions regarding the
shopping list to Defense Minister Ezer Weizman, whom he ordered to
personally approve what Israeli companies could and could not sell.
During their stay, the \"foreigners\" presented the Chinese with
brochures featuring different weapons they claimed they could get from
Israel. The Chinese were impressed but did not make any commitments.
Over the next year, the Israelis made additional trips, some involving
Israeli Air Force planes, which had their blue Star of David insignias
removed to keep their missions secret. By then, [[the Chinese knew they
were working]{.mark} directly [with]{.mark} the [Israel]{.mark}i
government]{.underline}. Once [[Beijing finalizing the
shopping]{.underline}]{.mark}, the Israeli delegation brought it to
Begin and Weizman for approval. The negotiations were a clash of
cultures. The [Israelis [wanted to sign]{.mark} one contract that could
be used for all [future sales]{.mark}]{.underline}. They were hoping for
a shopping bonanza. The problem was that the Chinese were not used to
complicated contracts. At one point during the negotiations, for
example, the Israelis insisted on including a force majeure clause in
the contract. \"What is that?\" the Chinese asked. After the Israelis
explained that it freed the sides of a breach of contract in the event
of an unforeseen act of God, the Chinese answered plainly, \"Well, there
is no need for that since we don\'t believe in God.\" It took a year,
but [the two sides]{.underline} finally [reached an
agreement]{.underline}. The first shipment---tank shells--- arrived in
1981. But the relationship remained a secret, even as the two sides
increasingly began to trust each other. [[The Chinese]{.mark} refused to
come to Israel but agreed to [sign hundreds of millions of dollars\'
worth of contracts]{.mark} for tank shells, missiles and radar systems,
among other things, after seeing a couple of photos and an occasional
video. They never visited a factory. [In the arms sales world, it was
unprecedented]{.mark} but showed an amazing level of trust between the
sides.]{.underline} In 1985, after dozens of trips, the veil of secrecy
lifted just slightly. For the first time, the Chinese agreed to issue
visas to nine executives from Israel\'s agriculture industry, including
a government official from the Agriculture Ministry. That same year,
Israel reopened its consulate in Hong Kong, which it had closed a decade
before. Israel pressed Beijing to establish official ties, but the
Chinese needed more time. In 1992, after the Madrid Peace Conference
between Israelis and Arabs, [[the Chinese finally agreed to establish
diplomatic ties with Jerusalem]{.underline}.]{.mark} Civilian trade
skyrocketed, growing from under \$100 million in 1992 to over [\$[8
billion 20 years later, turning China into Israel\'s No. 1 trade partner
in Asia]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [This was \"arms
diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark}[\" at its best, [with Israel using
superior technology]{.mark} and military expertise [to get a]{.mark}
country to become its [ally.]{.mark} It is a model the country would
continue to refine and use successfully]{.underline}---well after the
secret arms trip in 1979.

#### The UK is a potential arm seller to Israel -- they go around international law to sell arms

TR

[The British government licensed arms deals worth over £14m (\$17.8m) to
Israel last year even as Israeli soldiers were accused of intentionally
firing on Palestinian protesters at the Gaza border in what the UN says
may be potential war crimes.]{.underline} [Weapons approved for sale
included ammunition, components for assault rifles, and other types of
ar]{.underline}ms which could be used for repression, according to newly
released details from the Department of International Trade (DIT),
compiled by the Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT). Revelations of
the sales to Israel come after a UK court ordered the British government
last week to stop approving arms sales to Saudi Arabia because it failed
to fully assess whether the equipment might be used in breach of
international humanitarian law in the war in Yemen. One sale for more
than \$125,000-worth of military training equipment was approved on 18
May last year, four days after 68 Palestinians were killed by Israeli
troops on the most deadly day in Gaza since the 2014 Israeli offensive.
The DIT declined to give MEE more details about the equipment and how it
could be used. [The sale was approved the same week Prime Minister
Theresa May called the Palestinian killings \"extremely concerning,\"
and said there was an urgent need to find out why Israeli forces had
used live fire. \"While we do not question the right of Israel to defend
its borders, the use of live fire and the resulting loss of life is
deeply troubling]{.underline},\" May said in a 15 May press conference.
\"We urge Israel to show restraint.\" The violence at the border was
debated in parliament on the same day, with seven MPs calling for
greater scrutiny of arms sales to Israel and some calling for an
outright ban. [But the approval of licences continued, including
military radar equipment, missile technology and night-vision gear,
totalling about \$18m between 30 March until the end of the
year.]{.underline} That figure does not include sales that were approved
through what are called open licences, whereby UK firms are not required
to publicly disclose the values of arms or quantities sold. Use of these
opaque licences to sell arms to states in the Middle East and North
Africa rose by 22 percent between 2013 and 2017, MEE has reported. MEE
understands that the DIT reviewed export licenses for Israel following
the events at the border in May 2018 but found nothing to indicate that
[UK-supplied equipment had been used in a way that violated licensing
criteria.]{.underline} It would, however, revoke licences if that
assessment changed. A DIT spokesperson told MEE: \"All export licence
applications are considered on a case-by-case basis against
international criteria, including respect for human rights. We will
revoke any licences found to be no longer consistent with these
standards. \"We keep all defence exports under careful and continual
review.\" \'The message it sends\' But CAAT spokesperson Andrew Smith
said [that while it\'s not clear whether UK-made weapons were
specifically used on protesters, it is the symbolism of the UK
sales,]{.underline} which have continued through Israeli offensives on
Gaza in 2008 and 2014, that matters. \"If shooting on the border didn\'t
stop the arms sales, if the bombardment in 2014 and 2008 didn\'t stop
them, what more will it take?\" Smith said. \"The message it sends is
that, no matter what atrocities are inflicted on the Palestinian people,
arms sales will continue[.\" By continuing to arm and support the
Israeli military, he added, the UK is \"only making it more likely that
UK-made weapons will play a devastating role in the
future\".]{.underline} Asked about the figures, Palestinian Ambassador
to the UK Husam Zomlot told MEE it is the sole responsibility of the
British government to ensure that its arms sales are lawful, but he said
there was a wider legal context to consider beyond the arms trade. \"The
UK government can only say if it has done its due process. We are not
aware of such a process to ensure that these weapons do not harm
innocent Palestinians and they do not end up aiding Israel in its
illegal occupation and colonisation of the land and people of
Palestine,\" he said. [\"It\'s not just about a direct specific incident
only, but it\'s also about the overall macro picture of the entire
illegal situation of a state that has been in control of another and in
daily violations of basic UK and international law.\"]{.underline}
Shortly before the mass killing on 18 May, the UK parliament\'s
Committee on Arms Export Controls, the government\'s arms export
watchdog, wrote to Trade Secretary Liam Fox, asking whether he had any
information about how sniper rifles and their components approved for
sale to Israel in January 2017 had been used. Fox responded that the
company which exported the rifles and components used them to test
ammunition in the company\'s own firing range. \"We were satisfied that
there was not a clear risk that these items might be used for internal
repression or in the commission of a serious violation of international
humanitarian law,\" he wrote. Lloyd Russell-Moyle, an MP and member of
the committee, said the answer had been \"rather dissatisfactory\" and
called for end-use auditing that was more far-sighted. [\"There is no
good sending Israel arms in relative peace assuming the risk of it using
them is low only to realise it is too late when it launches another
disproportionate assault on their neighbours,\"]{.underline} he said.
According to Palestinian Ministry of Health figures released on Sunday,
306 people have been killed and 35,529 injured in what have been called
the Great March of Return protests. The ongoing initiative began in
March 2018 after a call from local civil society actors urged
Palestinians to engage in a mass march towards the Gaza fence in
opposition to Israel\'s 11-year-old siege on Gaza. A United Nations
inquiry released earlier this year found that Israeli soldiers
intentionally shot civilians and may have committed war crimes in their
heavy-handed response to the protests.

Brenna, "Strategies of Legal Rupture: the politics of judgment"
\[http://www.forensic-architecture.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/BHANDAR-Brenna.-Strategies-of-Legal-Rupture.pdf\]

In this article, [my aim is to consider the use of law as a political
strategy of rupture in colonial and post - colonial nation
states]{.underline}. [The question of whether]{.underline} and how [to
use law]{.underline} in order [to]{.underline} transform and potentially
[shatter an existing political - legal order is one that continues to
plague legal advocates in]{.underline} a variety of places, from
Australia, to India, to Canada to Israel/[Palestine]{.underline}. For
example, the struggle for the recognition of indigenous rights in the
context of colonial settler regimes has often produced pyrrhic
victories. 21 [T he question of indigenous sovereignty is ultimately
quashed]{.underline}, and aboriginal rights are paradoxically recognised
[as an interest that derives from the prior occupation of the
land]{.underline} by aboriginal communities but is at the same time
parasitic on underlying Crow n sovereignty[; an interest that can
be]{.underline} justifiably [limited in the interests of
settlement]{.underline}. 22 Thus, the primary and inescapable question
remains[: how does one utilise the law without re - inscribing
the]{.underline} very [colonial legal order that one is attempting to
break down?]{.underline} 23 I argue that this is an inescapable dilemma;
**[as]{.underline}** critical race theorists and **[indigenous scholars
have shown, [to not avail ourselves of the law]{.mark} in an effort to
ameliorate social ills]{.underline}**, and to promote and protect the
rights of oppressed minorities **[[is to]{.underline}]{.mark}**
essentially **[[abrogate]{.mark} one's political
[responsibilities]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Moreover, [the reality of
[political struggle]{.mark}]{.underline} (particularly [of the anti -
colonial variety]{.underline}) [is that it [is]{.mark} of a diffuse and
varied nature,]{.underline} [[engaging]{.mark} multiple [different
tactics]{.mark}]{.underline} in order to achieve its ends. The notion of
the ruptural defence emerges from the work of Jacques Vergès, a French
advocate and subject of a film by Barbet Schroder entitled Terror's
Advocate . The film is as much a portrait of Vergès ' life as it is a
series of vignettes of armed anti - colonial and anti - imperial
struggle during the decades between the late 1940s and the 1980s. I
should say at the beginning that I do not perceive Vergès as a heroic
figure or defender of the oppressed; we can see from his later decisions
to defend Klaus Barbie, for instance, that his desire to reveal the
violence wrought by European imperial powers was pursued at any cost.
But in [tracing]{.underline} the [development of]{.underline} what
Vergès called [the ruptural defence]{.underline}, the film [takes us to
the heart of]{.underline} the [inescapable]{.underline} [paradoxes and
contradictions involved in using law as a means of political resistance
in colonial]{.underline} and post - colonial [contexts]{.underline}. I
want to explore the strategy of rupture as developed by Vergès but also
in a broader se nse, to consider whether there is in this defence
strategy that arose in colonial, criminal law contexts, something that
is generalisable, something that can be drawn out to form a notion of
legal rupture more generally. To begin then, an exploration of Vergès'
'rupture defence', or rendered more eloquently, a strategy of rupture.
At the beginning of the film, Vergès comments on his strategy for the
trial of Djamila Bouhired, a member of the FLN, who was tried in a
military court for planting a bomb in a cafe in Algiers in 1956. Vergès
states the following in relation to the trial: The problem wasn't to
play for sympathy as left - wing lawyers advised us to do, from the
murderous fools who judged us, but to taunt them, to provoke incidents
that would reac h people in Paris, London, Brussels and Cairo\... [The
[refusal to play for sympathy]{.mark} from those empowered [to]{.mark}
uphold [the law]{.mark} in a colonial legal order [hints at]{.mark} the
much more profound [refusal]{.mark}]{.underline} that lies at the basis
of the strategy of rupture, which we see unf old throughout the film.
[In [refusing to accept the characterisation]{.mark}]{.underline} of
Djamila's acts [[as criminal]{.mark} acts, Vergès [challenges
the]{.mark} very legal [categories]{.mark} that were [used to
criminalise]{.mark}, condemn and punish [anti - colonial
resistance]{.mark}]{.underline}. The refusal to make the defendan ts'
actions cognisable to and intelligible within the colonial legal
framework breaks the capacity of the judges to adjudicate in at least
two senses. First, their moral authority is radically undermined by an
outright rejection of the legal terms of refer ence and categories which
they are appointed to uphold. [The legal strategy of [rupture]{.mark} is
a politics of refusal that [calls into question the justiciability of
the]{.mark} purported [crime]{.mark} by [challenging the]{.mark} moral
and political [jurisdiction of the colonial]{.mark} legal [order]{.mark}
itself.]{.underline} Second, the refusal of the legal categorisation of
the FLN acts of resistance as criminal brought into light the
contradictions inherent in the official French position and the reality
of the Algerian context. This was not, as the official line would have
it, simply a case of French criminal law being applied to French
nationals. The repeated assertion that the defendants were independent
Algerian actors fighting against colonial brutality, coupled with
repeated revelations of the use of torture on political prisoners made
it impossible for the contradictions to be "rationally contained" within
the normal operations of criminal law. The revelation and denunciation
of torture in the courtroom not to prevent statements or admissions from
being admis sable as evidence (as such violations would normally be
used) but to challenge the legitimacy of the imposition of a colonial
legal order on the Algerian people made the normal operation of criminal
law procedure virtually impossible . 24 And it is in this ma king
impossible of the operation of the legal order that the power of the
strategy of rupture lies. In refusing to render his clients' actions
intelligible to a colonial (and later imperial) legal framework, Vergès
makes visible the obvious hypocrisy of the colonial legal order that
attempts to punish resistance that employs violence, in the same spatial
temporal boundaries where the brute violence of colonial rule saturates
everyday life. In doing so, this is a strategy that challenges the
monopoly of le gitimate violence the state holds. Vergès aims to render
visible the false distinction between common crimes and political
crimes, or more broadly, the separation of law and politics. 25 [The
[ruptur]{.mark}al defence [seeks to subvert]{.mark} the
[order]{.mark}]{.underline} and structure of the tr ial [[by re -
defining the relation between accuser and accused]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[This [illumination of]{.mark}]{.underline} [the [hypocrisy]{.mark} of
the colonial state [questions the]{.mark} authority of its
[judiciary]{.mark} to adjudicate]{.underline}. But more than this, his
strategy is ruptural in two senses that are fundamental to the operation
of the law in the colonial settler and post - colonial contexts. The
first is that **[the space of opposition within the legal confrontation
is reconfigured]{.underline}**. The second, and related point, is that
the strictures of a legal politics of recognition are shattered. In
relation to the first point, a space of opposition is, in the view of
Fanon, missing in certain senses, in the colonial context. A space of
opposition in which a genuinely mutual struggle between coloniser and
colonised can occur is de nied by spatial and legal - political
strategies of containment and segregation. While these strategies also
exhibit great degre es of plasticity 26 , the control over such mobility
remains to a great degree in the hands of the colonial occupier. **[The
legal strategy of [rupture creates]{.mark} a space of [political
opposition]{.mark} in the courtroom [that cannot
be]{.mark}]{.underline}** absorbed or **[[appropriated by the legal
order]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In Christodoulidis' view, **[this lack of
co - option is the crux of the strategy of rupture]{.underline}**. [This
strategy]{.underline} of rupture also poin ts to a path that [challenges
the limits of a politics of recognition]{.underline}, often one of the
key legal and political strategies utilised by indigenous and racial
minority communities in their struggles for justice. Claims for
recognition in a juridical frame ine vitably involve a variety of onto -
epistemological closures. 27 Whether because of the impossible and
irreconciliable relation between the need for universal norms and laws
and the specificities of the particular claims that come before the law,
or because of the need to fit one's claims within legal - political
categories that are already intelligible within the legal order, legal
recognition has been critiqued, particularly in regards to colonial
settler societies, on the basis that it only allows identities, legal
claims, ways of being that are always - already proper to the existing
juridical order to be recognised by the law. In the Canadian context,
for instance, many scholars have elucidated the ways in which the legal
doctrine of aboriginal title to land im ports Anglo - American concepts
of ownership into the heart of its definition; and moreover, defines
aboriginality on the basis of a fixed, static concept of cultural
difference. [The strategy of rupture elides the violence of recognition
by challenging the legitimacy of the colonial legal order
itself.]{.underline} In an article discussing Vergès' strategy of
rupture, Emilios Christodoulidis takes up a question posed to Vergès by
Foucault shortly after the publication of Vergès' book, De La Stratégie
Judiciare, as to wh ether the defence of rupture in the context of
criminal law trials in the colony could be generalised more widely, or
whether it was "not in fact caught up in a specific historical
conjuncture." 28 In exploring how the strategy of [rupture could inform
practices]{.underline} and theory [outside of the
courtroom]{.underline}, Christodoulidis characterises the strategy of
rupture as one mode of immanent critique. [As individuals]{.underline}
and communities [subjected to the force of law, [the law itself becomes
the object of critique]{.mark}]{.underline}, the object that ne eds to
be taken apart in order to expose its violence. To quote from
Christodoulidis: Immanent critique aims to generate within these
institutional frameworks contradictions that are inevitable (they can
neither be displaced nor ignored), compelling (they necessitate action)
and transformative in that (unlike internal critique) the overcoming of
the contradiction does not restore, but transcends, the 'disturbed'
framework within which it arose. It pushes it to go beyond its confines
and in the process, fam ously in Marx's words, 'enables the world to
clarify its consciousness in waking it from its dream about itself'. 29
Christodoulidis explores how the strategy of **[rupture can be utilised
as an intellectual resource for critical legal theory]{.underline}** and
more broadl y, as a point of departure for political strategies that
could cause a crisis for globalised capital. Strategies of rupture are
particularly crucial when considering a system, he notes, that has been
so successful at appropriating, ingesting and making its own, political
aspirations (such as freedom, to take one example) that have also been
used to disrupt its most violent and exploitative tendencies. Here
Christodoulidis departs from the question of colonialism to focus on the
operation of capitalism in po st - war European states. It is also this
bifurcation that I want to question, and rather than a distinction
between colonialism and capitalism, to consider how the colonial (as a
set of economic and political relations that rely on ideologies of
racial diff erence, and civilisational discourses that emerged during
the period of European colonialism) is continually re - written and re -
instantiated through a globalised capitalism. As I elaborate in the
discussion of the Salwa Judum judgment below, it is the combi nation of
violent state repression of political dissent that finds its origins (in
the legal form it takes) during the colonial era, and capitalist
development imperatives that implicate local and global mining
corporations in the dispossession of tribal p eoples that constitutes
the legal - political conflict at issue. After the Trial: From Defence
to Judgment In response to a question from Jean Lapeyrie (a member o f
the Action Committee for Prison - Justice) during a discussion of De La
Stratégie Judiciare published as the Preface to the second edition,
Vergès remarks that there are actually effective judges, but that they
are effective when forgetting the essence of what it is to be a judge.
31 [The strategy of rupture is a tactic utilised to]{.underline} subvert
the order and structure of a trial; to [re - define the very terms upon
which the trial is premised]{.underline}. On this view, the judge,
charged with the obligation to uphold the rule o f law is of course by
definition not able to do anything but sustain an unjust political
order. In the film Terror's Advocate , one is left to wonder about the
specificities of the judicial responses to the strategy deployed by
Vergès. (Djamila Bouhired , for instance, was sentenced to death, but as
a result of a worldwide media campaign was released from prison in
1962). While I would argue that the judicial response is clearly not
what is at stake in the ruptural defence, I want to consider the
potentia lity of the judgment to be ruptural in the sense articulat ed
by Christodoulidis, discussed above. [Exposing a law to its own
contradictions and violence, revealing the ways]{.underline} in which a
law or policy contradicts and violates rights to basic political
freedoms , [has clear political - legal effects]{.underline} and
consequences. Is it possible for members of the judiciary to expose
contradictions in the legal order itself, thereby transforming it? Would
the redefinition, for instance, of constitutional provisions
guaranteeing r ights that come into conflict with capitalist development
imperatives constitute such a rupture? In my view, [the re - definition
of the limitations on the guarantees of]{.underline} individual and
group [freedom]{.underline} that are inevitably and invariably utilised
to justify state repression of rights [in favour of]{.underline}
capitalist development imperatives, security, or [colonial settlement
have the potential to contribute to the re - creation of political
orders that could be more just]{.underline} and democratic. **[We may be
reluctant to ever claim a judgment as ruptural out of fear that it would
contaminate the radical nature of]{.underline}** this form of
**[immanent critique]{.underline}**. Is to describe a judgment as
ruptural to belie the impossibility of justice, the aporia that
confronts every moment of judicial decision - making? I want to suggest
that it is impossible to maintain such a pure position in relation to
law, particularly given its capacity (analogous to that of capital
itself) for reinvention. Thus, I want to explore the potential for
judges to subvert state violence e ngendered by particular forms of
political and economic dispossession, through the act of judgment. In my
view, basic rights protected by constitutional guarantees (as in the
Indian case) have been so compromised in the interests of big business
and develo pment imperatives, that **[[re - defining]{.mark} rights to
[equality]{.mark}]{.underline}**, dignity and security of person,
**[[and subverting]{.mark} the interests of [the state]{.mark} -
corporate nexus [is]{.mark} potentially [ruptural]{.mark}, in the sense
of causing a crisis for discrete tentacles of global
capitalism.]{.underline}** At th is juncture, we may want to explicitly
account for the specific differences between criminal defence cases and
Vergès' basic tactic, which is to challenge the very jurisdiction of the
court to adjudicate, to define the act of resistance as a criminal one,
and constitutional challenges to the violation of rights in cases such
as Salwa Judum . [While one tactic seeks to render the illegitimacy of
the colonial state]{.underline} bare in its confrontation with anti -
colonial resistance, [the other is a tactic used to re - define the
terms upon which political dissent and resistance take place **within**
the]{.underline} constitutional [bounds of the post - colonial
state]{.underline}**.** [These two strategies appear to be each other's
opposite]{.underline}; one challenges the legitimacy of the state itself
through refusing the ju risdiction of the court to criminalise freedom
fighters, while the other calls on the judiciary to hold the state to
account for criminalising and violating the rights of its citizens to
engage in political acts of dissent and resistance. **[However, [the
common thread that situates these strategies]{.mark} within a singular
political framework [is the]{.mark} fundamental [challenge they pose to
the state's monopoly over]{.mark} defining the terms upon which [anti -
colonial]{.mark}]{.underline}** and anti - capitalist political
**[[action takes place]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Here I will turn to
consider a post - colonial context in which the colonial is continually
being re - written, juridically speaking, in light of neo - liberal
economic imperatives unleashed from the late 1980s onwards. [A recent
judgment of the Indian Supreme Court provide s an opportunity to
consider a moment in which]{.underline} capitalist development
imperatives and the [exploitation of tribal peoples by the
state]{.underline} of Chattisgarh [are put on trial by a group
of]{.underline} three [plaintiffs]{.underline}. The judgment provides,
amongst other things, an opportunit y to consider the strategy of the
plaintiffs and also the judicial response. As I argue below,
[this]{.underline} [judgment presents an instance of

Government of India and former Commissioner, Tribal Welfare, Government
of And hra Pradesh, petitioned the Supreme Court of India alleging,
inter alia , that widespread violations of human rights were occurring
in the State of Chattisgarh, on account of the ongoing Naxalite/Maoist
insurgency and the counter - insurgency activities of th e State
government and the Union of India (or the national government). More
specifically, the petitioners alleged that the State was in violation of
Articles 14 and 21 of the Indian Constitution. Article 14 guarantees
equality before the law of each citiz en and freedom from discrimination
on the basis of race, religion, caste, sex or place of birth. Article 21

### TVA Leahy's Law

Section 620M of the [Foreign Assistance Act of 1961]{.underline} (FAA),
as amended, [prohibits the furnishing of assistance authorized by the
FAA and the AECA to any foreign security force unit where there is
credible information that the unit has committed a gross violation of
human rights]{.underline}. The State Department and U.S. embassies
overseas implement Leahy vetting to determine which foreign security
individuals and units are eligible to receive U.S. assistance or
training. In February 2016, [Senator Leahy and 10 other Members of
Congress sent a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry asking the State
Department to determine whether alleged extrajudicial killings or
torture by Israeli military and police]{.underline} (and Egypt
separately) [should trigger Leahy law restrictions]{.underline}.63 In
its response to Congress, [the State Department stated that no Israeli
individual or unit potentially involved in the letter's alleged
incidents had been submitted to receive U.S. assistance.64]{.underline}

#### Leahy law stops funding to countries that commit human right against children

[A new bill would bar Israel from using U.S. funding to detain
Palestinian children.]{.underline} Rep. Betsy McCollum (D-Minn.)
introduced the legislation Tuesday. McCollum said in a statement
Wednesday that the Israeli military\'s practice of kidnapping and
abusing children was morally wrong. [\"Israel\'s system of military
juvenile detention is state-sponsored child abuse designed to intimidate
and terrorize Palestinian children and their families,]{.underline}\"
said McCollum. \"It must be condemned, but it is equally outrageous that
[U.S. tax dollars in the form of military aid to Israel are permitted to
sustain what is clearly a gross human rights violation against
children.\"]{.underline} At The Intercept, reporter Robert Mackey put
the treatment of Palestinian children into perspective: [Israel\'s
military typically arrests and prosecutes 500 to 700 Palestinian
children between the ages of 12 and 17 each year, subjecting them to
coercive interrogation, physical violence, and trials in military courts
that lack basic guarantees of due process.]{.underline} H.R. 2407 (pdf)
aims to change that. The bill, which was referred to the House Committee
on Foreign Affairs after being introduced, would amend the Foreign
Assistance Act---the so-called \"[Leahy Law]{.underline}\" that
[prohibits funding for countries that regularly violate human
rights---to disallow funding to go to the detention of
children.]{.underline} Specifically, the bill calls for [\"no funds
authorized to be appropriated for assistance to a foreign country may be
used to support the military detention, interrogation, abuse, or
ill-treatment of children in violation of international humanitarian
law.\"]{.underline} Humans Rights Watch Israel and Palestine Director
Omar Shakir called the bill an \"important initiative\" and praised
McCollum\'s \"strong words.\" This is McCollum\'s second time attempting
to pass legislation that prioritizes care for Palestinian children by
amending the Leahy Law. In the last session of Congress, McCollum
introduced similar legislation only to see it die in committee after
garnering the support of 30 co-sponsors. The new bill, as Josh Ruebner
reported Wednesday at Mondoweiss, is stronger and more direct in its
approach to dealing with the responsibility of the U.S. to the victims
of Israeli behavior.

In cases where an entire unit is designated to receive assistance, the
Department of State vets the unit and the unit's commander. When an
individual security force member is nominated for U.S. assistance, the
Department vets that individual as well as his or her unit. Vetting
begins in the unit's home country, where the U.S. embassy conducts
consular, political, and other security and human rights checks. Most
often, an additional review is conducted by analysts at the Department
of State in Washington, D.C. [The State Department evaluates and
assesses available information about the human rights records of the
unit and the individual,]{.underline} reviewing a full spectrum of open
source and classified records. When assessing whether information is
credible, [the following factors should be considered]{.underline}
weighing both the credibility of a source and the veracity of an
allegation: [Past accuracy and reliability of the reporting source as
well as original source, if known; How the source obtained the
information (e.g., personal knowledge obtained by a witness, witness
interviews collected by a non-governmental organization (NGO),
descriptions collected from government records, etc.); Known political
agenda of a source (both reporting source and/or original source, if
known) which might lead to bias in reporting; Corroborative information
to confirm part or all of the allegation; Information that contradicts
part or all of the allegation; History of unit and known patterns of
abuse/professional behavior; Level of detail of the GVHR allegation,
including detail in identification of the GVHR, perpetrator (or link to
an operational unit), and victim.]{.underline}

State Dept Refuses To Trace Whether Israel Is Using U.S. Military Aid
Illegally,\" In These Times

TR

Sabaa Obeid is not the only Palestinian to be killed by Israeli troops
with a U.S. weapon. [Since 2013]{.underline}, at least [272 Palestinians
were killed with U.S.-made weapons used by Israeli forces,]{.underline}
according to an In These Times survey of reports published by human
rights groups. [The total number of Palestinians killed by U.S. weapons
is likely more]{.underline}, though the exact number is unknown. [In
These Times examined 14 incidents over the past decade of allegedly
unlawful killings of Palestinians with U.S.-made guns.The full death
toll of Palestinians killed by U.S. weapons is likely far
higher]{.underline}, since many reports are not able to identify the
weapon used. It's not supposed to be this way. [U.S. arms exports to
Israel]{.underline} (and other countries) [are governed by laws placing
restrictions on sales to nations that abuse human rights.]{.underline}
Campaigns to cut U.S. military aid to Israel have latched onto a
particular measure, known as the [Leahy Law.]{.underline} [The law
prohibits U.S. assistance or training from flowing to foreign military
units that have committed a gross violation of human rights, unless the
foreign government has held that unit accountable.]{.underline} But
interviews with human rights advocates, [congressional aides and former
and current U.S. officials reveal that enforcement of the Leahy Law in
Israel is lax, with no tracking of which army units receive U.S.
weapons]{.underline}. [Human rights advocates]{.underline} say they
[have]{.underline} brought the State Department [evidence of specific
crimes committed by soldiers who clearly used U.S. weapons, only to have
that evidence brushed off.]{.underline} A current U.S. official, who
asked for anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the
press and could be fired as a result, told In These Times that [they are
not aware of any time when an Israeli unit was cut off from U.S.
assistance under the Leahy Law. This lack of enforcement allows Israel
to get away with extrajudicial executions of Palestinians, human rights
advocates say.]{.underline} Maria LaHood, deputy legal director at the
Center for Constitutional Rights, says [the United States' "unparalleled
support for Israel" gives it leverage to end these extrajudicial
killings if it chooses. "Our government does not lack the legal tools to
put an end to Israel's human rights violations,"]{.underline} she says.
["It lacks the political will."]{.underline}
