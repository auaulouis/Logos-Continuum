[[Arms exports are best used for maintaining or strengthening
relationships while limiting adversary access to client
states]{.underline}]{.mark}; a tool of nuanced influence, not outright
coercion. In fact, threatening to withhold arms sales to coerce a state
into changing its behavior often has the opposite effect, leading
clients to diversify their arms sourcing instead of shifting course.
Similarly, calls to restrict technology transfer and worries about
demands for direct offsets mistake what is known as "design technology
transfer" for the much more difficult "capacity" level of transfer. Both
are explained in more detail below, but for now [[it is worth noting
that design transfer, the level at which most of these offsets occur,
does not lead to the creation of an independent defense industry, but
instead provides the United States with a source of political
power]{.underline}.]{.mark} [The United States should not fear
technology transfer, but with the appropriate end-user controls,
encourage it. Additionally, while a large domestic market provides the
United States the luxury of sacrificing financial gains for political
influence]{.underline}, sometimes economics do matter; especially when
it comes to preserving complex production lines for future flexibility.
Finally, the United States should not look to use an arms embargo to
coerce Saudi policy change, not for economic reasons, but simply because
it is unlikely to work. Greasing the Skids, Not Twisting Arms [[Arms
sales are useful tools for maintaining communication, strengthening
relationships, and keeping potential adversary states at
bay]{.underline}.]{.mark} Conversely, as a blunt instrument of coercion
(i.e. if you do not do X, we will suspend Y), they are likely losers.
Senior U.S. government officials involved in the arms transfer process
that I interviewed over the past year during the course of my research
have echoed similar sentiments. This is also borne out by previous
research providing evidence that [using arms transfers as situationally
coercive tools is rarely successful]{.underline}. Interestingly,
[[coercion attempts using arms transfers are least likely to be
successful when used as a punishment or threat against an autocratic
regime, such as Saudi Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark}. Instead, punishments
in the form of an embargo can often push a client to diversify sourcing
rather than to change behavior. Consider Indonesia and Egypt. In 2015,
Egypt agreed to purchase nearly 50 Russian MiG-29M/M2s and more than
two-dozen French Rafales. This represented a shocking turn of events
after more than three decades of purchasing only American-made fighter
jets. It was also driven largely by the U.S. embargo put in place in
2013, after the Egyptian army's removal of then-President Mohamed Morsi,
who had won the presidency in a 2012 election. The embargo caused
significant tension between the two states driven by "an Egyptian sense
that they were at a point of mortal peril" while the United States was
moralizing about democratic reforms. Remarkably, the United States
lifted the embargo in 2015 with virtually no change in Egyptian
policies, no official U.S. "democracy certification", and Egyptian
military support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. The U.S. arms embargo
as a tool of coercive change was an abject failure. A similar story
played out in Indonesia more than a decade prior. A long-time arms
client of the United States with no history of Russian imports,
Indonesia announced a deal with Russia in 2003 to purchase Russian
Su-27/30s. While Indonesia was always far more politically neutral than
Egypt, this remarkable turnaround in arms sourcing diversification
appears to be the result of a U.S. arms embargo implemented in 1999 in
response to Indonesia's apparent human rights violations carrying out
heavy-handed military actions in East Timor. Furious at U.S. meddling in
something the government considered a domestic issue, Indonesia looked
instead to Russia with the specific intent to "overcome the effects of
\[U.S.\] arms sales restrictions." In other words, Indonesia looked to
diversify, not capitulate. Indonesia continued sourcing Russian arms
even after the United States lifted the embargo in 2005. Perhaps most
remarkably, even after the United States agreed to give Indonesia 24
F-16s in 2012, the archipelago state still agreed to purchase 11 Russian
Su-35s. The U.S. attempt at coercion not only failed but continues to
perpetuate negative strategic effects today. Who's Afraid of Technology
Transfer? Another argument for a more restrictive arms export policy
concerns direct industrial offsets (those economic agreements in which a
supplier invests in the industry of a client state directly related to
the arms being transferred) and technology transfer. However, these
tools should not be feared. Technology transfer is unlikely to breed
meaningful competition for the United States where it matters most, in
the medium- to high-end markets, and instead gives the United States a
source of political influence. The problem in many analyses is confusion
over the type of technology transfer. There are three ideal-typical
categories of transfer: material transfer, such as simple diffusion of
weapons and machines; design transfer, like blueprints and schematics;
and capacity transfer, which involves basic scientific knowledge and
expertise within the industrial base. Most technology transfers
ultimately fall into the first two categories, despite what a client
state might hope for. Consider the 2003 Polish decision to purchase
F-16s from Lockheed Martin with direct offsets valued at more than \$6
billion. This represented 170 percent of the program value and the
then-largest in commercial history. Despite this massive investment,
Poland does not design and produce their own fighter jets today, but
rather subsections of American-designed systems under license. In fact,
direct offsets provided inroads for U.S. industry in the Polish defense
industry in a manner that strongly incentivizes the Poles to continue
purchasing U.S. aircraft, and indeed Poland appears poised to purchase
the F-35 in the near future. Offsets and technology transfer may have
helped revive portions of the Polish defense industry and provided some
domestic job creation, but it did not create an independent competitor
to the U.S. defense industry. This is exactly as expected with material
and design levels of transfer. While some of the very largest industrial
states, such as India or China, might eventually create a world-leading
defense industry, it will remain out of the grasp of most states.
Consider China, an unquestionable economic powerhouse of recent decades.
Despite decades of arms purchases, technology transfer, blatant reverse
engineering attempts, and hundreds of billions of dollars, China still
turns to Russia for help with the most advanced weaponry such as fighter
jets, helicopters, surface-to-air missiles, radars, and jet engines. If
China, the second largest economy in the world struggles so mightily,
what threat do smaller, less capable states pose? Capacity transfer, the
acquisition of basic scientific knowledge and expertise crafted over
decades, cannot simply be uploaded, emailed to another state, or hacked.
Rather, it takes decades of intentional and costly investment. For
high-end weaponry, where research and development costs remain a
prohibitive barrier to entry, the United States and a handful of other
advanced economies are likely to remain in the driver's seat; even with
generous technology transfer agreements. Finally, consider some of the
negative second- and third-order effects that excessive restriction
caused in American unwillingness to commit to selling the U.S.-made
Patriot missile system and its underlying technology to Turkey. This was
recently posited as a U.S. export restriction success. However, this
restraint looks less successful each passing day. Even with significant
design transfer, it is unlikely Turkey could obtain the requisite
capacity transfer to be self-sufficient in surface-to-air and
anti-missile defense systems anytime soon. Conversely, by using U.S.
technology, the United States could have legally restricted Turkey's
future export of it. More importantly, Turkey has since agreed to
purchase Russia's advanced S-400 surface-to-air missile system, a blow
to U.S. and NATO relations with Turkey. The S-400 purchase will put
advanced Russian technology and military advisors inside a NATO ally and
tier-two F-35 industrial partner that is a sole-source supplier on
several F-35 components. As the Air Force Secretary said last year about
Turkey's S-400 agreement, "Sometimes it's the United States that's part
of the problem." Even worse, the United States has since approved the
sale of the Patriot to Turkey, with the acting U.S. Defense Secretary
recently commenting, "we need Turkey to buy the Patriot." Was holding
back on some surface-to-air missile technology worth the strategic cost?
It appears unlikely. Sometimes It's Not Dollars, But Sense As others
have pointed out, the United States can afford to "make economic \[...\]
sacrifices" in order to privilege politico-security benefits in arms
export decisions. As one author recently explained in War on the Rocks:
The United States is so economically advantaged in making and selling
weapons that it can limit conventional-weapons proliferation \[and\] ...
technology diffusion, (and maintain a robust defense industrial base)
while retaining its commanding market position. This is undoubtedly
true. However, on rare occasions economics do matter. Specifically,
maintaining strategic flexibility by keeping a production line open
which would otherwise shutter might sometimes need to be prioritized.
Consider the two recent examples of the F-22 and F-15. In December 2011,
the final F-22 fighter jet rolled off the assembly line, 554 short of
the original program requirement. At the same time, close U.S. allies
such as Japan and Australia made inquiries about purchasing further
increments of the fifth-generation fighter, which would have kept
production going for at least several more years. The United States
rejected the inquiries, shuttering the production line instead. A 2011
RAND Corporation study estimates the cost of restarting production and
fabricating 75 additional F-22s to be \$17 billion --- nearly \$227
million per jet. Despite this cost and because of an evolving
international security environment, the US Congress inserted language
into the 2017 defense budget directing the U.S. Air Force to conduct a
"production restart assessment," though the likelihood of a production
restart remains infinitesimally small. Fortunately, the outcome is
different for the F-15. In 2013, Qatar made a request for the purchase
of 70 F-15QAs, worth \$4 billion. At the time, without another export
order the 40-year old F-15 production line was slated to close by 2019,
eliminating any future purchases. After delaying approval for nearly
three years, the U.S. administration finally approved the deal in late
2016, guaranteeing F-15 production into the mid-2020s. Unlike the F-22,
the United States maintains strategic flexibility in F-15 (and F-18 and
F-16) production, largely because of exports. This appears to be an
especially prescient decision, as the FY2020 U.S. Air Force budget
proposal requests money to purchase at least eight (and up to 100)
F-15EX air superiority platforms; a platform one industry reporter
highlighted "is only possible because other countries have spent roughly
\$5B over the last couple of decades to continuously evolve the F-15
into what it is today \[...\] basically, the \[Air Force\] is getting
\[these upgrades\] for free." What About Saudi Arabia? In sum, [[more
restrictive arms sales, delivery suspensions, or outright embargos are
unlikely to succeed in policy coercion]{.underline}]{.mark}. While arms
transfers provide an avenue of influence, embargos often lead to
diversification, not desired policy changes. Additionally, fears of
technology transfer and direct offsets creating a competitor out of
every client are generally unfounded in the high-end market in which the
United States generally deals. Finally, while the large domestic market
provides the United States the luxury of sacrificing financial gains for
political influence, sometimes economics do matter, particularly when it
comes to saving a production line for future flexibility. These
conclusions should therefore inform U.S. policy on Saudi Arabia. The
intent here is not to argue the moral or ethical responsibility of U.S.
leaders in responding to Saudi Arabia's execution of journalists or
tactics in the war in Yemen. It is natural to see the horror wrought in
Yemen and want to take any actions necessary to stop it. However, I
ultimately argue against a Saudi embargo. This is not because, as the
president has argued, it might cost a few billion dollars and some
hundreds of defense industry jobs. As others have pointed out, the
economic impact of Saudi arms purchases on the U.S. defense industry is
relatively small. Rather, [[embargoing Saudi Arabia is unlikely to
fundamentally alter Saudi policies, **but likely to further damage U.S.
ties with Riyadh**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the near-term, Saudi Arabia
can substitute other weapons, such as the Eurofighter and Tornado, and
"dumb bombs" instead of U.S.-built "smart weapons." The Saudis can also
rely more heavily on their Emirati and Egyptian partners using non-U.S.
produced arms. In the medium to long term, such an embargo is likely to
push the Kingdom to greater arms diversification. If history is any
guide, the United States will eventually lift any potential arms embargo
with little change in Saudi behavior, but only after having provided an
opportunity for adversary states such as Russia and China to gain a
strategic foothold in Riyadh. Some might counter that it would be
extremely difficult and costly, in both time and money, for the Saudis
to significantly diversify their arms acquisitions away from the United
States. This is absolutely the case. However, costly does not mean
impossible. Less wealthy states have already done it. Egypt is one
example above; but others such as Venezuela and even tiny Kuwait ---
frustrated at years of U.S. approval delays --- have significantly
diversified their arms acquisitions. In other words, with the money and
options available to Saudi Arabia, and few other producers showing a
stomach for a full embargo, it is not unreasonable to believe that the
Saudis might significantly diversify their arms acquisitions over time
in response to a U.S. embargo. Thus, while a U.S. embargo might be
morally compelling and emotionally satisfying, it is unlikely to create
meaningful change for those most at risk or be strategically beneficial
to the United States. In the absence of a compelling, evidence-based
case that an arms embargo on Saudi Arabia might produce desired changes
in behavior, policymakers should look elsewhere for solutions to their
Saudi problems.

#### Aggressive US response collapses alliance and creates multiple scenarios for Mideast instability

Full Investigation Needed Before U.S. Takes Action on the Khashoggi
Crisis
https://www.heritage.org/middle-east/commentary/full-investigation-needed-us-takes-action-the-khashoggi-crisis

The U.S. Response The Trump administration must make it clear to the
Saudis that a failure to come clean on the Khashoggi affair could
severely undermine Saudi-American ties. It should disabuse Riyadh of any
notion that the White House is willing or able to protect Saudi Arabia
from congressionally-imposed sanctions, if the Saudis continue to
stonewall international efforts to get to the bottom of the matter. In
this context, Thursday's announcement that Treasury Secretary Steven
Mnuchin had cancelled his participation in next week's Saudi investment
summit is an appropriate and necessary signal. The U.S. cannot turn a
blind eye to state-sponsored murder or allow it to pass without
consequences. As a matter of principle, Washington should support free
speech, a free press, and respect for the rule of law. It cannot give
Saudi Arabia a free pass. If guilt is established, then it must hold the
Saudis accountable. There must be real consequences for such a horrific
act. Saudi officials found responsible for criminal acts should be
removed from their positions and prosecuted. But until guilt has been
established through a full investigation, it would be premature for U.S.
officials to impose punitive measures against Saudi Arabia. [[Washington
should not]{.mark} overreact by **[torpedo]{.mark}ing [the

the murder of Khashoggi was motivated by a sense of insecurity and
vulnerability. [Washington must]{.mark} take care that its response does
[not exacerbate]{.mark} that [insecurity]{.mark}, leading Riyadh to take
further steps that undermine American interests. In any event, [the U.S.

political pressures, or repeating false accusation," a government source
reportedly told the official Saudi Press Agency. "The Kingdom also
affirms that if it receives any action, it will respond with greater
action." Hence, [Saudi-owned Al Arabiya channel's general
manager]{.underline} Turki [Aldakhil]{.underline}, in our call of the

prices]{.mark}.**]{.underline} "[If U.S. sanctions are imposed on Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}, [we will be facing an economic disaster that would

[the]{.mark}]{.underline} [[price jumping to \$100, or]{.mark} \$[200,
**or even double that**]{.mark} **figure**]{.underline}." [This mess
could ultimately throw the entire Muslim world **"into the arms of

Washington]{.underline}," Aldakhil said. "[The truth is that if
[Washington]{.mark} imposes sanctions on Riyadh, it [will stab its own

#### That locks in Russian aggression and causes nuclear war

\"Do High Oil Prices Mean More International Conflict?\" American
Interest,
https://www.the-american-interest.com/2018/05/30/do-high-oil-prices-mean-more-international-conflict/

When asked in a recent interview about his famously sympathetic gaze
into Russian President Vladimir Putin's soul in 2001, former President
George W. Bush argued that [rising oil prices had fundamentally changed
his interlocutor:]{.underline} "When I looked into his eyes and saw his
soul, Russia was broke . . . \[t\][he price of oil goes up and Putin
changed."]{.underline} Does the relationship between oil prices and
Russian behavior to which Bush alluded hold true? [The higher the price
of oil, the more aggressive Russia becomes?]{.underline} And what about
other petrostates? Might it be true for those as well? We may soon have
more evidence for the proposition. [Oil prices are brushing off 2016
lows and hitting three-year highs.]{.underline} Brent crude has been
**[hovering above \$70 a barrel]{.underline}** since April, up from lows
of around \$30 in early 2016, [fueled by]{.underline} OPEC production
cuts and rising [geopolitical tensions]{.underline} ([over]{.underline}
issues like **[the Iran deal]{.underline}**). Though nuances,
complications, and exceptions abound, [the **[academic and historical
evidence]{.mark}** on balance [tells]{.mark}]{.underline} us that, as we
transition from a lower to [a [higher oil price]{.mark}
regime,]{.underline} we [can]{.underline} generally [[**expect a darker
geopolitical outlook**. As rising oil]{.mark} revenues **[gives
Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[Saudi]{.underline}**, Iran,
[and]{.underline} other **[oil-exporters]{.underline}** [an added
**sense of [confidence]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [it
may]{.underline}]{.mark} at least selectively **[[inflame]{.mark}
interstate [tensions]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[and lead
to]{.underline}]{.mark} more [**[aggressive behavior]{.underline}**.
[That]{.underline}]{.mark} [possibility, [alongside an **increasingly
hawkish U.S. national security team**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and a
President who appears]{.underline}]{.mark} **[to feel rather
"[unchained]{.mark}" of late]{.underline}**, [[points to
a]{.mark}]{.underline} potentially [**[combustible mix]{.mark} just
ahead.**]{.underline} It is generally taken for granted that aspects of
geopolitics can function as a key input into oil prices. Trump's mere
threat of a U.S. strike in Syria, for example, caused oil to spike by 2
percent on April 11. In addition to short-term effects, geopolitical
competition can influence prices in other ways. To give just one general
example, as Soviet power spread into parts of the Third World after the
independence era, some states felt safer nationalizing their oil
industries to escape Western company control (Iraq in 1961, for
example), and prices rose as a consequence. But the relationship may
also work the other way around: [Oil prices can also be a key input into
geopolitics]{.underline}. [Many studies]{.underline} have [demonstrated
that oil prices have a direct effect on the **domestic stability of
petrostates**]{.underline}. This makes ample intuitive sense: [Higher
prices fill public coffers, allowing governments to palliate needy
populations and potential elite opposition groups by dispensing more
largesse. Some regime elites may reason that a firmer grip on power may
free them to carry out more **assertive foreign policies without fear of
being undermined at home**.]{.underline} There are, however, several
complications to this general intuition. Some states already have
sufficiently buoyant revenues relative to their small populations to
satisfy their publics and feed clientelistic networks. Providing
largesse can also backfire if prices drop; taking away something
valuable that people have grown used to is a dangerous game, especially
when elites aren't ready to play it. And then of course there is the
famed "oil curse": For all sorts of reasons, from "Dutch disease"
economic distortions to the derangement of normal citizen-state
relationships, oil riches can in time undermine regimes, weakening and
even destroying them. That said, [a more recent body of research has
empirically demonstrated the intuitive twin of this conclusion: Higher
prices cause **greater interstate aggression**]{.underline} by
oil-producing countries. Why would this be the case? [[Greater oil
revenue flushes petrostates with]{.mark} confidence and also
[cash]{.mark} that [they **can put toward military spending or foreign
adventures**]{.mark}]{.underline}. To take one obvious example, we need
only look to Iran's using its oil revenue to fund proxy groups such as
Hamas and Hezbollah. Furthermore, [military spending by one regional oil
producer can beget spending by others, [fueling]{.mark} regional [arms
races that]{.mark} can [make]{.mark} [**aggression and conflict by
miscalculation** **more likely**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The onset of the
Iran-Iraq War in September 1980 may be a prime example of that dynamic.
[Most prominent]{.underline} among the empirical studies
[is]{.underline} Cullen S. [Hendrix's 2014 paper, which shows a
statistically significant relationship between higher oil prices and
"dispute behavior]{.underline}" (military actions short of actual war)
by oil-exporters. (Hendrix also summed it up nicely in this Washington
Post piece.) He found that "all things being equal, a [one standard
deviation]{.underline} (\$18.60) [increase in the price per barrel of
oil from the sample mean]{.underline} (\$33.81) [is associated **with a
13 percent increase in the frequency of \[dispute behavior\]" in
oil-exporting states**]{.underline}. He also found that,
[**[above]{.mark} \$[77]{.mark} a barrel, [oil-exporters are
significantly more dispute prone]{.mark} than non-oil exporters.**
Hendrix]{.underline} also [explores]{.underline} the potential
complication of [reverse causality]{.underline}: Could dispute behavior
by oil-exporting countries be driving prices higher, rather than the
other way around? A key analytical consideration here is timing. We can
all agree that geopolitical activity affects prices in the short-term
(such as the Syria example mentioned above), but is this reverse
causality true on a sustained basis? Parsing out long-term signal from
short-term noise, Hendrix examines whether elevated aggregate dispute
behavior affects oil prices at the yearly---rather than daily or
weekly---level, and finds that this relationship does not hold. His
explanation here is that other players typically step in to redress
markets: "While dispute behavior may drive prices changes in the short
term . . . the strategic significance of oil prices and oil-exporting
states encourages major powers to act in ways that stabilize markets,
either through market intervention . . . or direct, armed intervention."
Jeff [Colgan of Brown University has also touched on this]{.underline}
[topic]{.underline}, [finding through his research that [oil]{.mark} has
[fueled]{.mark}]{.underline}---in some way---one quarter to **[[one half
of interstate wars]{.mark} [since 1973]{.mark}]{.underline}**. He also
notes that [oil-producers are 50 percent more likely to engage in
conflict than non-oil producers.]{.underline} Colgan identifies [eight,
non-mutually exclusive causal mechanisms for how oil fuels international
conflict, most of which are]{.underline} implicitly [**exacerbated** by
higher prices]{.underline}. [They are: **"(1) [resource
wars]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} in which states try to acquire oil reserves by
force]{.underline}; (2) **[petro-aggression]{.underline}**, [whereby oil
insulates aggressive leaders]{.underline} such as Saddam Hussein or
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini [from domestic opposition
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} therefore [makes them more willing to engage
**in risky foreign policy adventurism**]{.underline}; **[(3) the
externalization of civil wars in oil-producing states]{.underline}**
("petrostates"); (**[4) [financing for
insurgencies]{.mark}]{.underline}**---for instance, Iran funneling oil
money to Hezbollah; (5) conflicts triggered by the prospect of
oil-market domination, such as the U.S. war with Iraq over Kuwait in
1991; (6**[) clashes over control of oil transit routes]{.underline}**,
such as shipping lanes and pipelines; (7[**) oil-related grievances,**
whereby the presence of foreign workers in petrostates helps extremist
groups such as al-Qaeda recruit locals]{.underline}; [and]{.underline}
([**8) oil-related obstacles to multilateral cooperation**, such as when
an importer's attempt to curry favor with a petrostate prevents
multilateral cooperation on security issues."]{.underline} Though he
doesn't substantiate statistically that higher prices lead to more
conflict through these channels, he implies it heavily. For example, he
writes that, "the low oil prices of the 1990s have given way to higher
and more volatile prices, increasing the magnitude of the consequences
one can expect from oil-conflict linkages." While the emerging academic
evidence may validate the claim that higher oil prices lead to more
aggression, the historical and anecdotal evidence is somewhat mixed, and
understandably so. Oil price is clearly only one of many inputs into
foreign policy decision-making, and an indirect one at that. No leader
thinks, "Now that oil is at \$X, I'm going to invade my neighbor."
Context obviously matters, too: No one imagines that Ecuador or Norway
is going to invade or try to blackmail a neighbor just because spot
prices rise 15 or 30 percent in a given six-month period. Price levels
seep into decision-making more subtly, affecting interlocking beliefs
about strategic behavior generally and specific cases more particularly;
they may fuel self-confidence by shoring up budget outlooks and funding
the tools of more aggressive behavior in contexts where such behavior
could conceivably make sense. Moreover, there are many contravening (and
occasionally countervailing) complications. Prominent among these is the
fact that low oil prices can incentivize states to "wave the flag" in
order to distract from domestic difficulties---so the impact of low oil
prices might lead to more aggressive behavior in some cases. That
suggests that neither high nor low prices per se may be the trigger
affecting behavior, but rather notable changes in price that become
politically salient in one way or another. And there's also the tricky
issue of timing: Over what timeframe does increased oil revenue fuel
aggression? Is it in anticipation of higher prices, in direct response
to the current pricing levels, or is there more of a lag in effect as
oil revenue slowly shores up---or is expected to shore up---budgets and
military spending over time? The answer might depend on specific cases
and leadership cadres. There is also a scaling problem. If a 20 percent
rise in oil prices makes a more assertive foreign policy more likely in
a given country, does a 40 percent rise make it twice as likely? Or put
differently, how much of a difference in price, and presumably in
expected revenues, does it take to cross a threshold where it might have
an impact on decision-making? Are there multiple thresholds? Russia
exemplifies these issues. Taking the same long view as George W. Bush in
his interview, it seems self-evident that [[rising]{.mark} oil
[prices]{.mark} and higher government revenues over the course of the
2000s gave Putin confidence, **funded military expansion and
modernization**, and]{.underline} helped **[[enable Russia's most
revanchist tendencies]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Between 2003 and 2013,
Russian military]{.underline} [expenditure]{.underline} **[doubled as
the price of Brent crude rose]{.underline}** from a low of around \$20 a
barrel in 2001 to a high of more than \$140 a barrel in 2008.
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, as the saying goes, **[[is a gas station

weapons, nuclear and otherwise]{.mark}.]{.underline}** But when you
cross reference this conclusion with specific acts of Russian aggression
over the past roughly twenty years, the picture gets much more
complicated. When Russia invaded Georgia in August 2008, oil was above
\$100 a barrel. Same with Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014. But
Russia also dramatically intervened in Syria in September 2015, when oil
had dropped to around \$50 a barrel and the economy was sputtering due
to both low energy prices and Western sanctions. Here, many analysts
plausibly described these interventions as a way of rallying Russians to
the flag and distracting them from domestic hardship. More likely, Putin
saw an emergency in Syria that simply had to be dealt with, no matter
the cost or risk; the Assad regime was in danger of collapsing, and
Syria is Russia's only ally offering ports and bases in the
Mediterranean basin. So Russia is a bit of a mixed bag, but [on balance
its behavior---especially over a long timeframe---appears to support the
thesis.]{.underline} Saudi Arabia's role in the 1973 Yom Kippur war also
illustrates the tricky question of timing. Saudi funding of the effort
was enabled by a financial buffer created by a rise in revenues from the
late 1960s, and was likely justified by an expected rise in revenues due
to an oil price increase that was anticipated, in part, because of the
very war it was in the process of financing. Its reserves had already
grown so large that, for the first time, Saudi Arabia could ride out a
supply (and revenue) disruption and still finance a war. But the Saudis
helped finance a war that they themselves did not participate in. So if
rising oil prices led to greater interstate aggression, it did so in
this case in a particularly indirect way. These are all interesting and
important nuances that attenuate any direct causal connection one might
be tempted to draw between oil prices and conflict. So it would be nice
to know if historical studies have shown any significant statistical
relationship between fluctuations in key sources of government revenue
(and what memoirs and archives tell us about how those situations were
perceived) and interstate behavior. It would be even nicer to drill down
into such studies to find cases where specific lucrative
commodities---for example, European colonial profits such as from
British opium sales in China, or cotton grown in Egypt---made any
difference in the behavior of the relevant governments. Alas, such
studies do not exist. But regardless of the timeframe and mechanism,
[academic and historical studies alike do suggest that higher oil prices
have generally lead to more **aggressive**]{.underline}, or at least
riskier, **[behavior in recent decades]{.underline}**---whether in
anticipation of higher prices, immediately in their wake, or only after
sufficient revenue stores are built up. [So are we at a point in the
energy price cycle where, all else equal, we should expect greater
interstate conflict? **We're close to Hendrix's \$77 a barrel
threshold**]{.underline}, [above which oil-exporters are significantly
**more dispute-prone than non-oil exporters**]{.underline}. But given
the nuances just described, this specific price threshold is probably
too cute. [The more realistic argument to make is about the effect of a
higher-price vs. lower-price paradigm over a multi-year
horizon]{.underline} (particularly in light of the timing issue and
potential lag). And if the period of the past two years (when Brent
largely hovered between \$40 and \$60) was a lower-price paradigm,
[2018-19 is potentially gearing up to be a]{.underline} [higher-price
paradigm]{.underline} driven by continued supply cuts by OPEC, tight
global inventories, and---in a coincidental way---heightened
geopolitical risks. We'll see how these factors play out, but if oil
prices remain elevated we may begin to subtly feel their effects on
behavior by Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and perhaps others.

[[A much greater existential risk emerged with]{.mark} the build-up of
nuclear arsenals in [the US and the USSR. An all-out nuclear war]{.mark}
was a possibility with both a substantial probability and with
consequences that might have been persistent enough to qualify as global
and terminal]{.underline}. There was a real worry among those best
acquainted with the information available at the time that [a nuclear
Armageddon would occur and that it [might annihilate our species or
permanently destroy human civilization]{.mark}. Russia and the US retain
large nuclear arsenals that could be used in a future confrontation,
either accidentally or deliberately]{.underline}. There is also a risk
that other states may one day build up large nuclear arsenals. Note
however that [[a smaller nuclear exchange]{.underline}]{.mark}, between
India and Pakistan for instance, [[is not an existential risk]{.mark},
since it would not destroy or thwart humankind's potential

#### And Bunzel says high oil prices causes Russian military modernization -- that causes nuclear war

(Jeffrey, "Can NATO Deter Russia in View of the Conventional Military
Imbalance in the East?,"
<http://csis.org/publication/can-nato-deter-russia-view-conventional-military-imbalance-east>)

The growing terrorist threat from the so-called Islamic State, Russia's
intervention in Syria, and the migration crisis in Europe have dominated
the headlines in recent weeks. But the recent downing by Turkey of a
Russian Su-24 plane that violated its airspace underscores as well the
risks of conflict between European states. There remains no question
that Russia's annexation of Crimea and aggression elsewhere in Ukraine
has ushered in a new period of insecurity in Europe, re-drawing
boundaries by force as well as heightening confrontation and the risk of
conflict between NATO and Russia. We have seen these elements before in
post-World War II history. In the late 1940's, there was a reduced
American military presence on the European continent, uncertainty about
the ultimate intentions of the Soviet Union, and the very real threat of
Soviet military intervention to coerce countries in the gray zone
between it and the West. And in the late detente period in the
mid-1970\'s, Soviet military modernization introduced new uncertainties
into the security balance with the deployment of new SS-20 nuclear
missiles in Eastern Europe. Today, [[Europe is faced with Russian
military modernization]{.underline}]{.mark} [and]{.underline} [Moscow's
willingness to coerce]{.underline} and to intervene in [sovereign
European states]{.underline}, countries, [challenges that West must meet
with **a reduced U.S. military presence in Europe**.]{.underline} Russia
has developed since 2008 the ability to rapidly deploy on the border
with NATO over 100,000 troops with practically no warning to the United
States and its European allies. At the same time, [Russia has shed most
of the meaningful measures that provided for transparency and
predictability in conventional arms by suspending its participation in
the]{.underline} Conventional Forces in Europe ([CFE)
Treaty]{.underline}. The West has not matched these developments: NATO
has abided by the intention in the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act that it
would not permanently station significant combat forces in the states
that joined NATO after the Cold War. [Europe's NATO members have reduced
defense spending]{.underline} since the fall of the Berlin Wall and
focused their remaining forces on expeditionary operations since 2001.
Thus, east of the Oder/Neisse/Danube Rivers, in territory populated by
about 100 million NATO citizens, there is no significant NATO military
presence to withstand an attack by Russia's increasingly capable armed
forces, should one take place. [**[The result is a clear and growing
conventional imbalance along the eastern frontier of
NATO,]{.underline}** [most crucially]{.underline}]{.mark} in the near
term in Poland and the **[[Baltic countries]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
which border Russian territory. Does this regional imbalance matter?
Skeptics could point to the overall levels of defense spending by NATO
member states. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute, defense spending by NATO countries in 2014 (measured in
constant 2011 dollars) was just over \$880 billion, whereas Russia's
spending similarly measured was about 10% of the NATO total -- just over
\$91 billion. Russia has argued that its modernization efforts are
designed to close a gap between it and NATO; indeed, the 2014 Russian
military doctrine asserts that NATO is building up its military forces
and ranks this as the top external military danger to Russia. If NATO
still spends ten times as much as Russia and has superior forces in
number, quality, and capability, how can one speak of imbalance? The
answer is that [the combination of [Russia's]{.mark} **rapid
deployability**]{.underline} [and its [growing **conventional
capabilities**]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[weaken]{.mark}
[deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[on NATO's eastern
flank]{.underline}, **[which has been the basis of Western
strategy]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[since the Cold War]{.underline}** --
that NATO will maintain sufficient forces (conventional and nuclear) in
order to convince any potential adversary that the risks of using force
against a NATO ally so clearly outweigh the potential gains that the
adversary will choose peace over war. The size and composition of forces
necessary to deter depends on the external environment and the
adversary's intentions -- the U.S. Army presence in Europe numbered
about 300,000 at the height of the Cold War, and it has been reduced to
around 30,000 today for two main reasons. First, the political changes
in Europe that led to the fall of the Iron Curtain enabled a period of
partnership with Russia that reduced tensions and dramatically lowered
the likelihood of conflict. Second, the United States and its Western
partners reinforced stability by concluding with Russia in the early
post-Cold War period limits on their conventional military deployments
and transparency measures for movements of conventional forces. The
Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty and the Vienna Document
(which among other things requires countries to notify large planned
military exercises) provided inspections, predictability and confidence
that allowed NATO allies to scale down their military posture --
limitations which Russia negotiated and agreed. (The treaty on
Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces -- INF -- advanced the same goal by
eliminating an entire class of nuclear weapons that was the principal
cause of increased tensions between NATO and the Warsaw Pact in the late
1970s and early 1980s, beginning with the Soviet deployment of SS-20
missiles and the NATO deployment in response of Pershing II missiles in
Europe.) NATO reviewed its deterrence posture in 2012 and determined
that, "in the current circumstances, the existing mix of capabilities
and the plans for their development are sound." But neither of the
crucial post-Cold War circumstances -- reduced tensions and increased
transparency -- exists today; indeed it is quite the opposite, with
increasing tensions and a substantial loss of transparency and
confidence. In 2008, Russia \'suspended\' its implementation of the CFE
treaty, which has effectively erased the limits that previously existed
on Russia\'s conventional forces on NATO's eastern flank. A last-ditch
2011 U.S.-led effort to revive conventional arms control with Russia was
unsuccessful. Russia also increasingly circumvents the Vienna Document's
6-week notification requirement for "scheduled" exercises by conducting
no-notice, full combat readiness exercises, a category of activity not
subject to the notification requirement. (According to the U.S.
government, Russia remains in violation of the INF treaty as well,
undermining the nuclear pillar of stability in Europe.) The result, when
coupled with Russia\'s post-2008 military modernization, has been a
quantum leap in Russia\'s ability to amass forces and a substantial
decrease in NATO\'s warning time. As Russia demonstrated in 2014 in
Crimea and eastern Ukraine, when a 150,000-man exercise took place
simultaneous with Russia's intervention, it can concentrate forces along
its western borders without significant warning to neighbors or to NATO
allies. This has been underscored throughout 2014 and 2015 in other
no-notice "snap" exercises, the largest of which numbered 100,000
troops. United States military officials estimate that Russia is able
now to deploy 60,000 troops by air in a span of 72 hours, and they
acknowledge that U.S. intelligence capabilities provide no significant
advance indication or warning of the Russian "snap" exercises. In these
circumstances, [NATO does not]{.underline} currently [have the ability
to repel a possible Russian attack]{.underline} or prevent Russia from
occupying territory in the east, in particular along NATO's eastern
borders in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Poland. **[[This situation is
destabilizing]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as these countries face the
prospect of discovering on any given day that several Russian army
divisions are on their frontier with unclear (or perhaps very clear)
intentions. To address such concerns, NATO leaders at the 2014 Wales
Summit created a "very high readiness" task force within the NATO
Response Force, consisting of a multinational land brigade of around
5,000 troops, ready to move within a few days; Supreme Allied Commander
Breedlove has indicated that the readiness of the forces is seven days,
though that could be adjusted down if developments required it. It is
open to doubt whether political and military decisions to deploy the
high-readiness task force could be reached quickly, which could lengthen
the effective time to deployment significantly beyond the 7 day target.
This means that NATO's current ability to respond is well beyond the
window within which Russia can mobilize forces that are ten or more
times larger. Given Russia's emerging anti-access and area-denial
capabilities, NATO's response after territory has been seized will come
at a much greater cost than deterring action in the first place. The
uncertainty over the security of northeast Europe is compounded by
geography and ambiguity about whether and how Russia would use its
nuclear arsenal. Russia's military doctrine, which was updated in 2014,
formally reserves nuclear weapons for use only in response to an attack
on Russia using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, or in
response to a conventional attack when Russia's existence as a state is
at risk. But public comments by Russian officials and retired military
officers, as well as Russian exercise scenarios, suggest that Moscow
could also contemplate limited nuclear strikes as a way of raising the
stakes in a conflict and "de-escalating" by confronting its opponent
with the possibility of a nuclear response. This divergence between
doctrine and other indications of Russian planning gives rise to a
nightmare scenario for countries in NATO's east: [[a Russian land
grab]{.underline}]{.mark} (similarly swift as in Crimea) [[and the
threat of nuclear "de-escalation]{.mark}" to confront
Washington]{.underline}, Berlin, Paris, and London [with the
catastrophic choice]{.underline} of [[risk]{.mark}ing]{.underline} a
**[[nuclear conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}** over several thousand square
miles in northeast Europe. This could freeze the conflict in place, with
NATO territory lost and credibility of the United States and the West
vitiated worldwide. Is that Russia's goal? The re-drawing of Ukraine's
borders, and Russia's continued occupation of 25% of the Republic of
Georgia's territory feeds increasing doubts about its intentions that
cannot be ignored. Russia's intentions toward NATO are harder to judge;
Russia traditionally has been cautious towards NATO, but that caution
may not be shared by a new generation of Russian military and political
leaders -- Russia increasingly engages in assertive and dangerous
activities such as violations of NATO airspace by Russian warplanes, and
nuclear saber-rattling against NATO members (and NATO partners such as
Sweden and Finland). The alliance's priority is avoiding a scenario ever
arising in which the United States and NATO have to contemplate how to
regain an ally's conquered territory, so an updated policy and
deterrence posture is prudent and necessary for stability on NATO's
eastern border. Without evidence to suggest that Russia's posture will
change, NATO and the United States must be prepared to deal with this
situation for at least the coming 5-10 years. The United States has made
an important initial contribution to this end since Russia's illegal
annexation of Crimea and invasion of eastern Ukraine, by rotating U.S.
Army units to the most vulnerable NATO members: the Baltic countries,
Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria. This contribution is all the more
significant given the ongoing U.S. commitments in the Asia-Pacific and
the Middle East. Many other allies have taken similar steps as well,
conveying their political and military commitment to their allies and
underscoring to Russia that NATO is united. But the size of the forces
involved thus far is small -- a few hundred troops on rotations lasting
a few months. As an immediate measure, as NATO prepares for its July
2016 summit meeting in Warsaw, putting this presence on a sustainable
and militarily significant basis is a crucial priority. Bringing the
disparate nations' force rotations into a coherent military structure
that is able to exercise and respond as part of a single whole is one
essential step. The United States should leverage its existing
contribution to security along NATO's eastern flank by making a
multi-year commitment to a forward presence in the east, and leading
efforts to secure similar commitments from other NATO allies --
especially from large NATO members, that would amount at least to a
multinational battalion in each of the Baltic countries and in Poland.
The predictable presence of sizeable NATO forces along the frontier with
Russia will be a crucial ingredient in a new deterrence approach. An
essential part of that sustainable long-term response is an assessment
of what is needed to deter Russia for the next decade. NATO has begun
this work, but it may take time to reach a consensus amid divergent
views on the urgency of the Russian threat. Time is not in NATO's favor
on the eastern frontier, however. A more robust deterrence in the form
of a larger and more capable multilateral presence in the near term will
allow for more detailed military and political analysis of Russia's
capabilities and intentions. A shared NATO understanding will also
increase the willingness of allies to fill the force rotations. The
ultimate shape of that force -- its size, the length of rotations, and
the type of forces -- will remain open, but its necessity is beyond
question, given Russia's more threatening posture and enhanced
capabilities. [[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates and its allies [[need
to]{.mark}]{.underline} work now to [[begin redressing]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} conventional [imbalance before]{.mark}]{.underline}

[As we approach the 100th anniversary World War I, we should remember
that this colossal disaster escalated uncontrollably from what was
intended to be a minor conflict. There is a danger that an attack on
Iran would escalate into a large-scale war]{.underline} in the Middle
East, entirely destabilizing a region that is already deep in problems.
The unstable government of [[Pakistan might be

reach unheard-of heights, with catastrophic effects on the global
economy. In the dangerous situation that could potentially result from
an attack on Iran, there is a risk that [**[nuclear weapons would be

Is [the world about to **change the slogan of the war on terrorism to
World War III**]{.underline}? Will we hear the drums of war again after
70 years of world peace since the last world war? Is it going to reshape
the world map? Clearly there are different views and scenarios for the
world's major powers that manage crucial decisions on how the situation
must end or be controlled in the light of [the [proliferation of
terrorist organizations]{.mark}]{.underline}, their branches and agents
around the world[, all [posing a **major threat**]{.mark} to
everyone]{.underline}. It seems until there is understanding of the
beneficiaries of these organizations, [the]{.underline} announcement of
a [new war is **inevitable**]{.underline}. Some believe that the
shooting down by Turkey of a Russian fighter jet was like pouring oil on
fire that created extra tension in the region that may lead to a new
war. But I don't believe in this view, because Turkish foreign policy
has had a fixed principle for centuries, whereas Russian ambitions in
the region are the greatest threat to Turkey. So Russia and Turkey are
in different camps and an international consensus broker is essential,
of course. The United States of America is playing this role now. Even
if we assume that this incident hadn't occurred, the heated conditions
are not going to calm down nor peace achieved as long as there is almost
an international cover for unknown organizations calling themselves
Islamic. But the truth of the matter is that the Islamic religion is
innocent. And whether these [[militants]{.underline}]{.mark} declare
themselves moderate, opposition, extreme or by any other name, they
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} still [[eyeing]{.mark} a spot in a rich and
strategic area like [Syria or Iraq]{.mark}]{.underline}, [which is a
**real disaster**]{.underline} [for]{.underline} us in [this
region]{.underline}. Right now [there is a state of global alert against
IS]{.underline} [in the wake of]{.underline} the recent [Paris attacks
and]{.underline} the [downing of a Russian passenger
aircraft]{.underline} over Sinai. Turkey seems concerned that [the
Russian position will increase **stiffness**]{.underline} [in the war on
terror]{.underline}, whether it is done with the consent of the US,
Saudi Arabia and other countries or not, especially now that Russia has
a strong hand in the region and major allies. So events may evolve in
the coming days faster than we expect, especially with the elimination
of large terrorist organizations such as IS and others. This is not a
controversial topic, bearing in mind the possibility of all terror
groups uniting together. Interests unite enemies. This matter does not
require a lot of intelligence. [Every world war needs a conflict
somewhere for the interests of **greater powers**]{.underline} to create
a new world order. And [with the large number of terrorist organizations
inside Syria, **the land is ready**]{.underline}. Even if [an
alliance]{.underline} is formed now between the great powers to destroy
IS, it [[may result in]{.mark} a [conflict **between**]{.mark} **the
[major powers]{.mark}**]{.underline} on how to do so. It appears that
both [Russia and the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates are
[hold]{.underline}ing **[different views]{.underline}** about the way
the future of Syria must be shaped and the role of terrorist
organizations. It seems clear that [Russia finds these organizations a
threat to be eliminated, but the United States' statements do not seem
agreeable to this scenario]{.underline}, especially with the US election
coming soon. **[No country is safe today from the possibility of a world
war]{.underline}**. Any [[fighting]{.mark} here]{.underline} [[could
**spread**]{.underline} [to **other parts of the
world**]{.underline},]{.mark} [even to faraway countries such as
[**India**, **Pakistan** or]{.mark} the **[E]{.mark}ast [C]{.mark}hina
[S]{.mark}ea**]{.underline} region, for example, [especially if [China
conducts **preemptive strikes**]{.mark} on US military
installations]{.underline}[. [The US will be **forced to respond**,
and]{.underline}]{.mark} [[the entire Pacific]{.mark} region
[will]{.mark} then [fall into]{.mark} a **quagmire of
[chaos]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Henry Kissinger, former US national
security adviser, said in an interview recently: "[The view of [World
War III]{.mark} **appears [on the horizon]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} its two ends, which are [the United States on the one
hand and China, Russia and Iran on the other]{.underline}". He added
that this war will be a draconian one with one victor -- the United
States. That was his point of view. But we are no longer in the era of
World War I and II, and [in]{.underline} light of [the]{.underline}
overlapping of ideologies and **[global pandemonium]{.underline}**, [I

#### Goes Nuclear\-\--can't turn it because scenario is about [conventional conflict]{.underline} escalating 

**Russell, 9** (James A. Russell, Senior Lecturer, National Security
Affairs, Naval Postgraduate School, '9 (Spring) "Strategic Stability
Reconsidered: Prospects for Escalation and Nuclear War in the Middle
East" IFRI, Proliferation Papers//, #26,
\_\_http://www.ifri.org/downloads/PP26_Russell_2009.pdf\_\_)

[Strategic [stability]{.mark}]{.underline} in the region
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [[undermined by]{.underline}]{.mark}
various factors: (1) asymmetric interests in the bargaining framework
that can introduce unpredictable behavior from actors; (2) the presence
of non-state actors that introduce unpredictability into relationships
between the antagonists; (3) [incompatible assumptions about the
structure of the deterrent relationship that makes the bargaining
framework strategically unstable]{.underline}; (4) perceptions by Israel
and the United States that its window of opportunity for military action
is closing, which could prompt a preventive attack; (5) the prospect
that Iran's response to pre-emptive attacks could involve unconventional
weapons, which could prompt escalation by Israel and/or the United
States; (6) [the lack of a communications framework to build trust and
cooperation among framework participants]{.underline}. These systemic
weaknesses in the coercive bargaining framework all suggest that
[[escalation]{.mark} by any the parties [could
happen]{.mark}]{.underline} either on purpose or [[as a result of
miscalculation]{.mark} or the pressures of wartime
circumstance]{.underline}. Given these factors, it is disturbingly easy
to imagine scenarios under which [[a conflict could **quickly
escalate**]{.mark} in which the regional [antagonists would
consider]{.mark} the use]{.underline} of chemical, biological, or
**[[nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It would be a mistake to
believe the nuclear taboo can somehow magically keep nuclear weapons
from being used in the context of an unstable strategic framework.
Systemic asymmetries between actors in fact suggest a certain increase
in the probability of war -- a war in which escalation could happen
quickly and from a variety of participants. Once such a war starts,
events would likely develop a momentum all their own and decision-making
would consequently be shaped in unpredictable ways. The international
community must take this possibility seriously, and muster every tool at
its disposal to prevent such an outcome, which would be [[an
**unprecedented disaster** for]{.underline}]{.mark} the peoples of the
region, with substantial risk for the [[entire
world.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### It causes [terror]{.underline} from domestic instability and [shocks]{.underline}\-\--that causes extinction 

**Crowley, 3/26/14** -- Michael, Chief Foreign Affairs Correspondent for
TIME ("Yes, Obama Really Is Worried About a Manhattan Nuke," Time,
<http://time.com/39131/barack-obama-nuke-manhattan-new-york/> //Red)

[The President]{.underline} was accused of changing a difficult subject
when he [said [a]{.mark} nuclear weapon going off in New York City was
more of a threat to the U.S. than Russia]{.underline}, but he is
actually laser-focused on non-proliferation and nuclear security issues
Yikes! [Does Obama really think there's a serious chance]{.underline}
that Manhattan could get nuked? [He almost **certainly**
does.]{.underline} Some people accused Obama of changing a difficult
subject: "Simply because the President can dream up other horrible
scenarios is no excuse for failing to address the immediate ones,"
snapped conservative Washington Post blogger Jennifer Rubin. Obama made
his startling claim in response to a question about the way he'd teased
Mitt Romney for claiming, during the 2012 campaign, that Russia was
America's greatest strategic foe. In hindsight, Obama's response to
Romney seems glib at best. And [[nuclear terror]{.mark}ism certainly
[seems a more remote prospect]{.mark} than it did a few years
ago]{.underline}. After Sept. 11, 2001, there was constant talk about
such a nightmare scenario. It was invoked as a reason to invade Iraq.
John Kerry and George W. Bush agreed on virtually nothing in 2004,
except the view that nuclear terrorism was the gravest security threat
facing the U.S. Such talk is less common now, [[thanks to a weakened
al-Qaeda]{.mark} leadership]{.underline} and, perhaps, a post-Iraq
reluctance in Washington to hype the WMD threat. (Incidentally, the
White House said on Tuesday that Obama wasn't referring to any specific
new intelligence about nuclear terrorism.) [Sept. 11]{.underline} also
[caused governments around the world to take the prospect of
catastrophic terrorism more seriously. That led to security upgrades
everywhere]{.underline} from Eastern Europe to Africa to Australia (and
the surrender of 15 bombs' worth of material by Ukraine). [But the
threat itself remains all too real.]{.underline} "[We've made enormous
progress over the course of the last few years]{.underline}," [Matthew
Bunn, a nuclear-proliferation expert]{.underline} at Harvard's Belfer
Center for Science and International Affairs, [said]{.underline} at a
recent nuclear-security conference in Washington. "[But there's a
long]{.underline}, long [way to go]{.underline}." Experts have recently
estimated the probability of such an attack in the near future at
between 30% and 50%. That number might've been too high to begin with,
and may be even more so now thanks to recent advances in nuclear
security. But what's an acceptable risk for such an utterly nightmarish
event? Would you fly on a plane with even a 1% chance of crashing? The
[probability guru [**Nate Silver** has looked at the numbers and]{.mark}
concluded that [nuclear terrorism represents a **far greater risk** than
conventional]{.mark} terrorism]{.underline}, adding that "a more
rational antiterrorism policy would focus resources heavily, perhaps
almost exclusively, on threats of nuclear and
weapons-of-mass-destruction terror." As it happens, the federal
government spends millions of dollars furnishing New York City and other
major cities with nuclear-detection gear --- although NYC lawmakers
seized on Obama's comment to complain that the President's budget would
cut Manhattan's nuke-finding funding from \$22 million to \$12 million
next year. By the time a bomb reaches a big city, however, it's probably
too late to avert a catastrophe. That's why Obama has put so much effort
into his nuclear-security summits, which emphasize the need to carefully
secure and monitor nuclear material that could be stolen and fashioned
into a bomb. A terrorist group could never enrich its own uranium, or
acquire plutonium --- just look at how much time, money and effort Iran
has spent trying to do so[. [A small group with
modest]{.underline}]{.mark} [scientific [knowledge]{.mark} and a low
budget, however, probably [could make a Hiroshima]{.mark}-grade
[bomb]{.mark} from highly enriched uranium. Where would terrorists get
[that]{.mark} nuclear [material?]{.mark} They [could steal]{.mark} it
[by force]{.mark}, a scenario that can't be ignored in Pakistan. Or
[they]{.mark} [could buy it from smugglers, who continue to be
caught]{.mark} peddling uranium]{.underline} stolen from the old Soviet
nuclear complex. The goal of the U.S.-led nuclear summits is to keep
world leaders focused on the problem. "He believes that this is one of
the most important legacies of his Administration," Obama's coordinator
for weapons of mass destruction and arms control, Elizabeth
Sherwood-Randall, said earlier this month. A gimmicky nuclear-terrorism
war game conducted in the Hague this week --- which reportedly irritated
German Chancellor Angela Merkel --- seems mainly to have been a PR
stunt. The main task now is to pursue international standards and
practices for ensuring nuclear security. Unfortunately, the countries of
greatest concern --- namely Pakistan and North Korea --- refuse to
participate in such collegial international efforts. That's just one
reason why Obama's concern is justified. Vladimir [Putin may threaten
international norms --- but **[nuclear terrorism threatens civilization
as we know it.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

### 2NC AS key to Relations

#### Withdrawing arms sales to Saudi Arabia calls into question the regime's legitimacy---this particularly damages US-Saudi relations.

Daniel L. **Byman** **16** \[Senior Fellow - Foreign Policy, Center for
Middle East Policy\], 5-24-2016, \"The U.S.-Saudi Arabia
counterterrorism relationship,\" Brookings,
<https://www.brookings.edu/testimonies/the-u-s-saudi-arabia-counterterrorism-relationship/>
{OS}

For the royal family, **[this general domestic support is mixed with a
need for legitimacy]{.underline}**. The royal family is not elected, and
its record of providing services and economic growth is mixed. It is
particularly vulnerable now given the collapse of the price of oil since
mid-2014: the Kingdom's budget deficit today is the largest in its
history.\[31\] As such, the royal family relies heavily on its pact with
the clerical establishment to implement Islamic law in the Kingdom and
to defend the faith in general. Rejecting missionary work and religious
education, with this pact in mind, is difficult, and even rejecting
violence in the name of the faith is hard if the cause is popular, as is
the anti-Assad struggle in Syria today. The new king, Salman bin Abdel
Aziz Al Saud, if anything, has moved closer to the clerical
establishment since he took power in 2015. He fired the Kingdom's only
female Cabinet minister and is in regular contact with leading
conservative clerics.\[32\]

The Saudi royal family, however, is also pragmatic. **[It values its
relationship with the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates,
and the 2003 attacks taught it that problems that are seemingly safely
abroad can come home quickly and unexpectedly. So the time-honored
practice of diversion -- convincing radicals to go after other targets
-- is risky. **[The regime is particularly sensitive to anything that
might call into question the regime's legitimacy]{.underline}**, and it
has not hesitated to silence or imprison popular clerics when necessary.

#### Arm sales key to relations.

**Thrall & Dorminey 18** (A. Trevor Thrall and Caroline Dorminey, 13
March 2018, "Risky Business: The Role of Arms Sales in U.S. Foreign
Policy" Cato Institute.
[www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy](http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy))

[Few tools have been used in pursuit of so many foreign policy
objectives as arms sales.]{.underline} The United States has sold
weapons to its NATO allies to ensure their ability to defend Western
Europe; to friendly governments around the world facing insurgencies and
organized crime; to allies in the Pacific (buffering them against
China's rising military power); and to both Israel and many of its Arab
neighbors in efforts to maintain regional stability and influence over
Middle Eastern affairs. [The United States has used arms sales, as well
as the threat of denying arms, in efforts to influence human rights
policies, to help end conflicts, to gain access to military bases, and
to encourage fair elections.]{.underline} Since 9/11, the new central
focus of U.S. weapons sales has been to bolster the global war on
terror.36 Despite their many uses, [arms sales impact foreign affairs
through two basic mechanisms. The first involves using arms sales to
shift the balance of power and capabilities between the recipient and
its neighbors, thereby helping allies win wars or deter
adversaries]{.underline}, promote local and regional stability, or
buttress friendly governments against insurgencies and other internal
challenges.37 During the Cold War, American arms sales became part of a
broader strategy to deter the Soviet Union from invading Western Europe.
In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the United States sold weapons to
Afghanistan and Iraq to bolster their ability to defeat the Taliban, al
Qaeda, and the Islamic State. [By selling advanced weaponry to Taiwan,
Japan, South Korea, and Australia, the United States hoped to balance
rising Chinese power and promote regional stability.]{.underline}
Although the specific objectives differ, at root the causal mechanism is
the same: using arms sales to shift the balance of power in a direction
more favorable to American interests.38 [The second mechanism involves
using arms sales to generate leverage over the conduct of other nations.
As the producer of the world's most advanced and sought-after weaponry,
the United States can dictate, at least to some degree, the conditions
under which it will agree to sell certain weapons.]{.underline} 39 As
Andrew Shapiro puts it, ["**When a country acquires an advanced U.S.
defense system, they** are not simply buying a product to enhance their
security, they are also seeking a relationship with the United States...
This engagement helps **build bilateral ties and creates strong
incentives for recipient countries to maintain good relations with the
United States."**]{.underline}

## Impacts 

### 2NC ME Impact 

#### US strategy in the Middle East is dependent on Saudi Arabia---terror, oil, deterring Iran

Anthony **Cordesman** **18** \[Anthony H. Cordesman is the Arleigh A.
Burke Chair in Strategy at CSIS\] , 3-22-2018, \"Saudi Arabia is a
Critical American Security Partner in the Middle East,\" No Publication,
<https://www.csis.org/analysis/saudi-arabia-critical-american-security-partner-middle-east>
{OS}

Somewhere along the line, we seem to have forgotten that **[our strategy
in the Middle East is dependent on Saudi Arabia as our most
important]{.underline}** single **[security partner]{.underline}**.
Israel's security is certainly a key American concern, but
[it]{.underline} does not [play an active role in most of America's
ongoing military engagements in the region, in dealing with Iran, or in
a direct fight against violent extremist movements like ISIS and Al
Qaeda.]{.underline}

Saudi Arabia's role as a strategic partner has also been enhanced by the
fact that Egypt and Algeria are focused on their own internal stability,
and their roles in the region have sharply diminished, and Iraq and
Syria both must deal with major instability problems and are at war. Our
European allies have declining power projection capabilities, and
Turkey's role in the region is increasingly problematic.

It is certainly true that **[Saudi Arabia needs the United States as
much or more than the United States needs Saudi Arabia.]{.underline}**
Saudi military forces are steadily improving, but it is the [**U.S.
presence in the region that creates a balance of forces that firmly
deters Iran** and has helped Saudi Arabia defeat its own terrorist
threats from groups like Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.]{.underline}
U.S. arms shipments, advisory efforts and exercises also play a critical
role in improving Saudi forces.

But **[the United States needs Saudi Arabia as well. Saudi Arabia
is]{.underline}** now [**the most critical single security partner in
ensuring the stable flow of petroleum out of the Gulf region**. While
the United States is largely eliminating its need for direct petroleum
imports]{.underline}, **[it is steadily increasing its dependence on the
health and growth of the global economy and imports from Asian
states]{.underline}** like China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, which
are critically dependent on Gulf petroleum exports. The end result is
that U.S. strategic interests in the region continue to increase in
spite of the steady cut in U.S. direct oil imports.

This is why focusing on more U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia and Saudi
investment in the United States[, ignoring the growing role Saudi Arabia
has played in fight terrorism since 2003, downplaying the need to
cooperate in checking Iran, and treating the war in Yemen as is if Saudi
Arabia does not face real threats, is not the way the United States
should deal]{.underline} with Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman's visit
to the White House.

Saudi Arabia's reform and economic development plans are critical to its
stability and the region's security. The Kingdom needs U.S.
encouragement and an understanding that Saudi Arabia cannot implement
these plans effectively without outside support. The burden sharing
argument has become absurd. Saudi Arabia cannot be treated as a source
of ready money every time the United States has a need.

Saudi Arabia is already spending more than 10 percent of its economy on
security, which is at least three times the economic burden on the GDP
that security spending places on the United States. This spending is too
high given the Kingdom's other needs, and the United States should be
focusing on better ways to make its security partnerships with Saudi
Arabia, as well as the other Gulf states and Jordan more efficient and
less costly, not simply on getting Saudi Arabia to spend more.

At the same time, **[Iran is all too real a threat. Effective joint
action in dealing with Iran's nuclear programs, its ballistic and cruise
missile programs, its asymmetric threats to Gulf shipping, and expending
military influence in the region are all critical common U.S. and Saudi
priorities.]{.underline}**

### 2NC Terrorism

#### Strong US-Saudi cooperation counters terror most effectively.

Daniel L. **Byman** **16** \[Senior Fellow - Foreign Policy, Center for
Middle East Policy\], 5-24-2016, \"The U.S.-Saudi Arabia
counterterrorism relationship,\" Brookings,
<https://www.brookings.edu/testimonies/the-u-s-saudi-arabia-counterterrorism-relationship/>
{OS}

I argue that **[Saudi Arabia has made considerable progress on
counterterrorism in the last 15 years]{.underline}** but still has a
long way to go. Before the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and
really until Al Qaeda began to attack the Kingdom directly in May 2003,
Saudi Arabia was often uncooperative on counterterrorism and more part
of the problem than part of the solution. **[Since 2003,
the]{.underline}** Saudi **[regime has emerged as a vital
counterterrorism partner]{.underline}**, and **[several important
successes against Al Qaeda in particular are due in large part to Saudi
cooperation]{.underline}**. Complicating this picture, however, is that
much of Saudi 'support' for terrorism involves actors outside the Saudi
government: the regime has at times supported, at times deliberately
ignored, and at still other times cracked down on these actors. Some of
these figures are important for regime legitimacy, and it is difficult
for the regime to openly oppose them. As a result, the Saudi Kingdom
still spews out material that is anti-Semitic, sectarian, glorifies
several conflicts in which jihadists play an active role, and otherwise
contributes to a climate of radicalization.

[Washington's ability to influence the Kingdom is limited]{.underline},
however, given the Saudi domestic sensitivities of these issues. In the
end, policymakers would do well to remember that Saudi Arabia is a key
partner but not a friend: **[the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[and Saudi Arabia share many common
interests]{.underline}**, but they do not share common values or a
common worldview.

#### If these terrorist groups cannot be countered, their efforts will escalate to nuclear terrorism.

Russ **Wellen** **14** \[Russ Wellen edits the Foreign Policy in Focus

metaphysics of nuclear weapons, he has written about disarmament for a

<https://fpif.org/islamic-state-capable-nuclear-terrorism/> {OS}

"**[If (ISIS) succeeds in firmly consolidating their grip on the land
they occupy]{.underline}** in Syria and Iraq, we will see the world's
first truly terrorist state established within a few hours flying time
of our country," ... Britain and the West cannot cede ISIS "the space to
plot attacks against us, train their men and women, and devise new
methods to kill indiscriminately," she said.

"**[We will see the risk]{.underline}**, often prophesied, but thank God
not yet fulfilled, **[that with the capability of a state behind them,
the terrorists will acquire chemical, biological or even nuclear weapons
to attack us]{.underline}**."

#### Nuclear terrorism will cause global nuclear war, leading to extinction

Mohamed **Sid-Ahmed 04** \[Egyptian political analyst for the Al-Ahram
newspaper\]. Al-Ahram online, August 26, 2004,
<http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/705/op5.htm> {OS}

A **[nuclear attack by terrorists will be]{.underline}** much more
**[critical]{.underline}** than Hiroshima and Nagazaki, even if \-- and
this is far from certain \-- the weapons used are less harmful than
those used then, Japan, at the time, with no knowledge of nuclear
technology, had no choice but to capitulate. Today, the technology is a
secret for nobody. So far, except for the two bombs dropped on Japan,
nuclear weapons have been used only to threaten. Now we are at a stage
where they can be detonated. This completely changes the rules of the
game. We have reached a point where anticipatory measures can determine
the course of events. Allegations of a terrorist connection can be used
to justify anticipatory measures, including the invasion of a sovereign
state like Iraq. As it turned out, these allegations, as well as the
allegation that Saddam was harbouring WMD, proved to be unfounded. What
would be the consequences of a nuclear attack by terrorists? [Even if it
fails**, it would further exacerbate the negative features of the new
and frightening world in which we are now living**]{.underline}.
**[Societies would close in on themselves, police measures would be
stepped up at the expense of human rights, tensions between
civilisations and religions would rise and ethnic conflicts would
proliferate]{.underline}**. It would also speed up the arms race and
develop the awareness that a different type of world order is imperative
if humankind is to survive. But the still more critical scenario is
**[if the attack succeeds. This could lead to a third world war, from
which no one will emerge victorious.]{.underline}** Unlike a
conventional war which ends when one side triumphs over another, this
war will be without winners and losers. **[When nuclear pollution
infects the whole planet, we will all be losers]{.underline}**.

{OS}

**[Faced with]{.underline}** such diverse and **[dangerous adversaries,
Saudi Arabia has spared no effort or expense to combat
terrorism]{.underline}**. **[The kingdom is committed to uprooting
extremism at the source and draining militant groups of
resources]{.underline}**.

Saudi Arabia has arrested extremists within its borders, tried them
before specialized courts and imposed the ultimate penalties on those
convicted. The kingdom has implemented one of the world\'s strictest
financial control systems to combat terrorism financing.

Donations in mosques and public places are prohibited, and Saudi
charities are prohibited from transferring money outside the country to
ensure that charitable funds do not find their way to violent
extremists.

In 2005, the kingdom launched a national public awareness campaign
against extremism that is still ongoing to counter the extremist
narrative and educate our public about the dangers of violent extremism.
In 2008, it launched a global interfaith dialogue to promote harmony
among the world\'s religions and cultures. A global center was
established in Vienna to continue this effort.

In addition to actions, **[Saudi Arabia has worked with other nations to
combat terrorism---both diplomatically and militarily]{.underline}**.
Through a \$110 million grant, Saudi Arabia helped establish the United
Nations Counter-Terrorism Center to combat terrorism, address the
mindset of extremism that foments terrorism and build the capacity of
U.N. member states to fight against terrorism.

**[Saudi Arabia has established \"fusion cells\"]{.underline}** where
law enforcement and intelligence **[officials from Saudi Arabia, the
United States and other partners work closely together to investigate
and interdict terrorism plots and finances]{.underline}**.

#### Saudi cooperation is vital to counterterrorism efforts --- they've been a strategic partner for quite some time --- Aff plan destroys this.

Daniel L. **Byman** **16** \[Senior Fellow - Foreign Policy, Center for
Middle East Policy\], 5-24-2016, \"The U.S.-Saudi Arabia

{OS}

Indicative of this change, **[in 2008 the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[and Saudi Arabia signed a bilateral
agreement on technical counterterrorism cooperation]{.underline}**.
Under the agreement, the United States provides advisors, funded by
Saudi Arabia, to assist on security measures. The U.S. military also
assists in training Saudi forces.\[10\]

**[Saudi officials are now vital counterterrorism allies. They are
playing a leading role]{.underline}** in trying **[to stop funding to
the Islamic State and]{.underline}** the **[Al Qaeda]{.underline}**
core.\[11\] The shift in the Saudi approach and **[the importance of
Saudi Arabia's role in counterterrorism can be seen in several successes
against Al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen]{.underline}**, Al Qaeda in the
Arabian Peninsula (**[AQAP]{.underline}**). One of the more notable
examples of Saudi Arabia's increasingly important role in combatting
terrorism was [the foiled 2010 AQAP cargo plane bomb plot]{.underline}.
According to a story in the New York Times, Saudi **[intelligence
provided the critical tipoff to the]{.underline}** American and European
intelligence **[officials that allowed]{.underline}** British and
Emirati **[security personnel to intercept the expertly concealed bombs
that were already en route to the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates.\[12\] The last minute intelligence was the
product of long-running Saudi intelligence operations to infiltrate
AQAP.\[13\] The Saudi connection was probably decisive as the concealed
explosives had already cleared multiple security screenings before the
timely Saudi warning initiated the successful multilateral worldwide
search.\[14\] In addition to these human intelligence capabilities
within jihadist circles (not easily matched by Western intelligence),
Saudi Arabia also plays a central role in the U.S. campaign against AQAP
in Yemen by hosting a base for drone and other attacks in Yemen
according to the BBC.\[15\]

#### There is a clear link---we need Saudi Arabia to defeat terrorist organizations.

### Bioterror Extinction

#### I/L: Terrorists will use bioweapons

**Williams and Sizemore 19**. (Mollie Williams, Harvard MD and expert on
health-related issues. Daniel C Sizemore, associate professor at West
Virginia University, expert on health-related issues. "Biological,
Chemical, and Radiation Terrorism Review", NCBI,
<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493217/>)

The agents are typically found in nature, but they may be altered in a
laboratory to increase their resistance to antibiotics, and ability to
spread in the environment. Biological and chemical agents may be spread
through the air, food, or water. **[Terrorists use biological agents
because they are often difficult to detect and illness onset may be
delayed for hours to days increasing dispersal]{.underline}**.

**[Bioterrorism agents are a common choice for terrorists because they
easy and inexpensive to produce, easy to disseminate, and can cause
widespread effects]{.underline}**. The challenge with bioweapons is that
they may affect both enemy and friendly forces. Terrorists use biologic
weapons as a method of creating mass panic.

During World War I there was widespread use of chemical weapons that
often affected the civilian population resulting in many deaths. Since
this war, most countries have agreed not to use chemical and biologic
weapons. Unfortunately, **[with]{.underline}** our present age of
**[terrorism]{.underline}** from individuals, splinter groups, and
dictators, **[there is an ever-present risk that these agents will be
used]{.underline}**.

**[Biological warfare agents]{.underline}** are bacteria and viruses
that **[infect humans, animals, and crops resulting in]{.underline}** an
incapacitating or **[fatal disease or crop destruction]{.underline}**.
**[Symptoms may not appear for days to weeks]{.underline}**. **[Often
the bacteria or virus is weaponized]{.underline}**, and **[the changes
will affect a broader segment of humans, animals, or crops than the
normal pathogen]{.underline}**.

In a biological warfare terror event, healthcare providers must deal
with uncommon pathogens that rarely affect humans**[. Healthcare
facilities will be inundated with victims]{.underline}**. The arrival of
one or more victims with an odd presentation may be the initial
indication that an act of terrorism has occurred.

**[Biologic agents may be dispersed by several techniques including
contaminated water and aerosol sprays. They can also infect individuals
and place them on airplanes, buses, or large events that will disperse
the virus quickly.]{.underline}**

The ever-present potential of a terrorist bombing concerns as it may
well lead to countless casualties; however, a biologic,
[chemical]{.underline}, or nuclear **[attack may rise to the level of an
international catastrophe]{.underline}**. Healthcare professional must
prepare as individuals and as a team to care for the victims. It is
important for each of us to acquire the information and skills needed to
respond and to take steps to limit to the morbidity and mortality
associated with a such an attack.

Finally, it establishes some broad characteristics that could identify
the types of terrorist groups that might be more likely than others to
use biological weapons. The findings suggest that, since the
technological, logistical, and financial barriers to the use of
biological agents are not insurmountable, a key determinant in the
potential use of such agents will be the willingness of terrorists to
engage in this new type of violence. Therefore, **[efforts to improve

### 2NC Oil 

#### US is dependent on Saudi oil---arms sales, relationships between states, and oil cooperation are all deeply intertwined---experts prove.

Vincenzo **Bove 18** \[Vincenzo Bove is a reader in Politics and
Quantitative Methods at the University of Warwick\], 5-4-2018, \"How the
arms trade is used to secure access to oil,\" Conversation,
<https://theconversation.com/how-the-arms-trade-is-used-to-secure-access-to-oil-95089>
{OS}

**[Selling weapons is]{.underline}** a **[lucrative]{.underline}**
business. As well as the money to be made, **[the arms trade
is]{.underline}** also **[a barometer of the quality of relationships
between states]{.underline}** and **[it creates an interdependence that
gives current and future recipient governments incentives to cooperate
with arms suppliers.]{.underline}**

**[Oil dependency is another reason]{.underline}**. Sometimes this idea
is disregarded as a conspiracy theory, but colleagues Claudio Deiana,
Roberto Nisticò and I recently researched the extent to which
**[oil-dependent countries transfer arms to oil-rich
countries]{.underline}**. It turns out it's a lot.

The international transfer of weapons is one of the most dynamic and
lucrative sectors of international trade. By one estimate, from the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, global transfers of
major weapons have grown continuously since 2004 and between 2012 and
2016 reached its highest volume for any five-year period since the end
of the Cold War. The value of the global arms trade in 2015 was at least
US\$91.3 billion, roughly equal to the GDP of Ukraine, or half of
Greece's GDP.

Since no country is self-sufficient in arms production -- even the US --
most of the countries in the world import weapons. This is shown in the
image below, which displays the volume of arms imports of major
conventional weapons between 2012 and 2016.

At the same time, the **[export of arms is a key part of national
policy]{.underline}** -- and weapons are often given only to close
allies. It is not unusual to observe arms transferred for free to
allies, under the umbrella of military aid, such as US military support
to Colombia to fight drug cartels and insurgent groups. Equally, the
absence of trade in arms between two countries can reflect a desire to
safeguard national security. For example, if there are fears that the
importing nation can become a future threat.

To test the idea that **[energy dependence leads to a higher volume of
arms transfers between countries]{.underline}**, [we assembled a large
dataset]{.underline} with information on oil wealth (such as production,
reserves and recent discoveries) and oil trade data, to measure energy
interdependence and the potential damage of regional instabilities to
oil supplies.

We found **[the existence of a "local oil dependence]{.underline}**",
which **[indicates that the amount of arms imported has a direct
relationship with the amount of oil exported to the arms
supplier]{.underline}**. Speculatively, arms export to a specific
country is affected by the degree of dependence on its supply of oil.
The [larger the amount of oil that country A imports from country B, the
larger will be the volume of arms that country A will transfer to
country B.]{.underline}

But we did not only find the existence of a direct oil-for-weapons
relationship. Our results also reveal the presence of a "global oil
dependence". [The more a country depends on oil imports, the higher the
incentives are to export weapons to oil-rich economies]{.underline},
even in the absence of a direct bilateral oil-for-weapons exchange**[.
The idea is that by providing weapons, the oil-dependent country seeks
to contain the risk of instabilities in an oil-rich
country]{.underline}**.

The oil-rich country does not necessarily need to be the oil-dependent's
direct supplier, however, because [disruptions in the production of oil
are likely to affect oil prices worldwide]{.underline}. Violent events
such as civil wars or terrorist incidents are often accompanied by
surging oil prices, or more general insecurity in the supply of oil.
This was the case in many recent wars, such as the Gulf War and the Iraq
War, the political unrest in Venezuela in 2003, and the recent
Iraq-Kurdistan conflict.

So it does not matter how much oil the UK directly imports from Saudi
Arabia for it to want the country to remain stable, which in turn [keeps
oil prices stable]{.underline}. In line with this, we found that a
country with a recent discovery of new oil fields will increase its
import of weapons from oil-dependent economies by 56%.

Our results point consistently toward the conclusion that the **[arms
trade is an effective foreign policy tool to secure and maintain access
to oil.]{.underline}** As such, the arms trade reveals national
interests beyond simple economic considerations and the volume of
bilateral arms transfers can be used as a barometer of political
relations between the supplier and the recipient states. At the same
time, we find that [oil might play an even larger role in influencing
economic and political decisions than is generally
acknowledged.]{.underline}

**[The]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[has always been]{.underline}** very **[concerned about]{.underline}**
the **[proliferation risks]{.underline}** involved in nuclear
cooperation, and **[in 2008 it was able to achieve a]{.underline}**
memorandum of **[understanding]{.underline}** with Saudi Arabia **[on
nuclear energy cooperation]{.underline}** whereby the latter pledged to
acquire nuclear fuel from international markets, rather than producing
it indigenously. But ten years later, it seems that **[Saudi Arabia no
longer views itself as bound by that understanding]{.underline}**.
**[The current challenge]{.underline}** for the United States **[is how
to insist on what is known as a 123 agreement with Saudi]{.underline}**
Arabia, meaning that **[the agreement explicitly denies Saudi Arabia the
right to work on]{.underline}** sensitive **[nuclear
technologies]{.underline}** ([enrichment capabilities and plutonium

fact that it is not willing to divulge information regarding the status
of the negotiations does not bode well in this regard. The
administration **[is keenly aware of the link to Iran's nuclear
posture]{.underline}**, and that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action
(JCPOA) set a very negative precedent for nuclear cooperation with other
states when it legitimized Iran's enrichment capabilities. While Iran
must cap its stockpile of enriched uranium for the duration of the deal,
it is allowed---under the explicit terms of the deal---to work on R&D
into an entire range of advanced centrifuges. Iran has plans to install
and operate these centrifuges eleven years into the deal. **[There is
a]{.underline}** real **[question of how these capabilities can be
denied to states like Saudi Arabia who are in good standing with the
NPT, whereas Iran---who blatantly violated the

with military aid and the kingdom would plow petrodollars into
Treasuries to finance U.S. spending. The grand total of Saudi
holdings]{.underline}** in 2016? **[\$117 billion]{.underline}**,
**[ranking]{.underline}** Saudi Arabia **[among the top 12 foreign
holders]{.underline}** of U.S. bonds. Some analysts have speculated that
it might hold even more indirectly.

**[Saudi]{.underline}** Arabia **[could divest its Treasury
holdings]{.underline}**, **[and threatened to do just that when it faced
pressure]{.underline}** over the involvement of its citizens in the
Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. But it is far from the biggest direct investor,
limiting the impact. China and Japan hold over \$1 trillion each of U.S.
Treasuries, which are classed among the safest investments on Earth.

"**[The most powerful weapon Saudi has is]{.underline}** oil and **[its
investments]{.underline}**," said Fawaz Gerges, a professor of
international relations at the London School of Economics. "I doubt
Saudi will decrease the production of oil to the world economy because
it will hurt itself, and I doubt that Saudi will withdraw its
investments."

### NU -- Relations 

#### Relations are strained, not high, currently.

**CFR 18**, 12-7-2018, \"U.S.-Saudi Arabia Relations,\" Council on
Foreign Relations,
<https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/us-saudi-arabia-relations> {OS}

**[Relations]{.underline}** between the two countries **[have
grown]{.underline}** especially **[warm under]{.underline}** U.S.
President Donald J. **[Trump and]{.underline}** Saudi de facto leader
Mohammed **[bin Salman]{.underline}**, who was elevated to crown prince
in mid-2017. Both have ramped up efforts to counter Iran, Saudi Arabia's
main regional rival. However, recent actions under the crown prince's
leadership, particularly **[the killing of]{.underline}** journalist
Jamal **[Khashoggi, are posing new strains on the
alliance]{.underline}**, as many **[members of]{.underline}** the U.S.
**[Congress]{.underline}** have **[call]{.underline}**ed **[for
punishing]{.underline}** **[Riyadh and reassessing the
relationship.]{.underline}**

#### Alt causes damaging Saudi Relations in SQUO.

John **Hannah 17**, 5-20-2017, \"Trump Should Salvage U.S.-Saudi
Relations,\" Foreign Policy,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/27/trump-should-salvage-u-s-saudi-relations/

The [U.S.-Saudi relationship is in real trouble]{.underline}. And things
could get worse---even much worse.

[Bipartisan majorities in Congress have already made clear their desire
to punish Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman]{.underline} for a long
series of transgressions, including the kingdom's role in Yemen's
catastrophic civil war and the murder of dissident U.S.-based journalist
Jamal Khashoggi. These [efforts will only intensify as the 2020 U.S.
presidential election cycle ramps up]{.underline}. [For the
ever-expanding list of Democratic aspirants, the temptation to outdo
each other in attacking President Donald Trump's close links to the
kingdom's leadership will be nearly irresistible]{.underline}. [It's a
truism of U.S. politics that there's no downside to Saudi
bashing]{.underline}. That's doubly true today, with the controversial
Mohammed bin Salman at the helm, and with talk of the [use of bone saws
on journalists,]{.underline} the [detention and torture of U.S.
citizens]{.underline}, and the [abuse of women's rights activists
dominating the headlines]{.underline}. **[Even if Congress falls short
of getting any new anti-Saudi legislation past the president's veto, the
constant drip, month after month, of hearings, bills, and public
criticism targeting the kingdom risks doing serious long-term damage to
the two countries' strategic relationship.]{.underline}**

### Turn -- Pressure Good 

#### Turn -- the plan creates a more sustainable foundation for relations -- current alliance makes instability inevitable 

Aaron David **Miller 18** \[a former Middle East analyst at the State
Department and adviser in Republican and Democratic administrations, is
a vice president and director of the Middle East program at the Woodrow
Wilson Center. Richard Sokolsky is a nonresident senior fellow at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. From 2005 to 2015, he was a
member of the secretary of state's Office of Policy Planning\]
10-25-2018, \"The US Saudi Relationship is Worth Preserving but not
Under the Current Terms,\" Washington Post,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2018/10/25/the-u-s-saudi-relationship-is-worth-preserving-but-not-under-the-current-terms/?utm_term=.5e6e984ea14c>
{OS}

The **[U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia is therefore worth preserving
--- but not under current circumstances or at any price]{.underline}**.
In the past two years, the Trump administration has allowed the dynamic
to slip out of our control into the hands of the inexperienced,
**[overly ambitious and reckless Crown Prince]{.underline}** Mohammed
Bin Salman, who **[has not only taken U.S. support for granted but also
exploited it to pursue policies that fundamentally undermine American
interests and values]{.underline}**.

The de facto ruler of **[Saudi Arabia has left a trail of failed and
feckless policies abroad with which]{.underline}** the
**[Trump]{.underline}** administration **[is now linked]{.underline}**:
**[the kidnapping of the Lebanese p]{.underline}**rime
**[m]{.underline}**inister, **[the]{.underline}** prosecution of a
**[disastrous war in Yemen]{.underline}** that has become the world's
greatest humanitarian disaster, and **[an ill-conceived boycott of Qatar
that has made it more difficult to form a united Gulf state front
against Iran]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}, like the war in Yemen,
has [only enhanced Iranian influence]{.underline}.

At home, under the cover of several important social and economic
reforms (including the decision to allow women to drive and a crackdown
on the religious police) MBS has shown a darker and ruthless side ---
**[brooking no dissent; arresting journalists, civil society bloggers
and women activists from the driving campaign]{.underline}**; and
imprisoning and bilking wealthy Saudis in the "shaikhdown" at the
Ritz-Carlton.

The **[killing of Khashoggi reflects the culmination of a pattern of
destructive]{.underline}** MBS **[policies]{.underline}** that the
**[Trump]{.underline}** administration has either ignored,
**[enabled]{.underline}** or supported through acquiescence or silence.
Worse still, the president and his son-in-law Jared Kushner's approach
to Saudi Arabia has been based on magical thinking. [Far from being a
catalyst in containing Iran or taking a lead role in Israeli-Palestinian
peacemaking, MBS's policies in Qatar and Yemen have enlarged Tehran's
room to maneuver.]{.underline}

King Salman had to walk back his son's enthusiastic support for the
president's peace plan. [The administration might very well get some
Saudi help to dampen upward pressure on oil prices when new U.S.
sanctions on Iran remove oil from the market, but this will surely
benefit Saudi Arabia and is anchored in Saudi Arabia's own national
interest.]{.underline}

The challenge isn't just punishing Saudi Arabia for killing a
journalist. The **[Saudis have been undermining U.S.
interests]{.underline}**, too. **[We need to take steps to rebalance
what has become a one-sided, dysfunctional relationship]{.underline}**.
The administration should start by freezing senior-level contacts with
the kingdom, beginning with MBS, for a period of time to send an
unmistakable signal that it is losing confidence in the crown prince.
Washington should also suspend support for the Saudi air campaign in
Yemen --- a misadventure that is seen as MBS's war --- and press Riyadh
to show greater flexibility toward a U.N.-brokered political solution.

There is also no reason that the United States should not speak out
against MBS's repressive policies at home, which over time could
accelerate instability in Saudi Arabia. And if it's proved that MBS was
involved in Khashoggi's murder, additional steps such as freezing
assets, travel bans and suspension of arms sales should be considered.

This is a critical inflection point in U.S.-Saudi relations. MBS could
conceivably rule Saudi Arabia for 50 years. The **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates has a strong stake in supporting a wise,
prudent and reform-minded leader; it **[most certainly doesn't have an
interest in being used and abused by a reckless authoritarian who seems
bent on repressing his own citizens, killing his opponents,
destabilizing the region and undermining American interests and values
in the process]{.underline}**.

#### The plan key to changing Saudi behavior -- turns all their impacts 

Daniel **Larison** **18** \[senior editor at TAC, where he also keeps a
solo blog. He has been published in the New York Times Book Review,
Dallas Morning News, Orthodox Life, Front Porch Republic, The American
Scene, and Culture11, and was a columnist for The Week. He holds a PhD
in history from the University of Chicago, and resides in Dallas\],
10-11-2018, \"Congress Should Cut Off All Support to Saudi Arabia,\"
American Conservative,
<https://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/congress-should-cut-off-all-support-to-saudi-arabia/>
{OS}

The **[war is draining the kingdom's coffers]{.underline}**. And
**[responsibility for the war is on Mohammed bin Salman]{.underline}**,
who as defense minister has driven Riyadh into this quagmire. **[Shaking
the arms relationship is by far the most important way to clip his
wings]{.underline}**.

Congress now has the power to make a serious decision, **[halting arms
sales and the logistics train for the kingdom in the wake
of]{.underline}** the reported **[murder of]{.underline}** Saudi critic
Jamal **[Khashoggi]{.underline}** in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul,
Turkey last week. The outrageous attack on Jamal deserves serious
reaction, and given Trump's dereliction of duty on the matter, it is up
to Congress to act. The president may try to override a Senate arms
stand-down but it would be a painful setback for the prince.

Congress ought to have cut off military support and arms sales to the
Saudis long ago, and they should certainly do so now. **[This
would]{.underline}** not only **[send a clear message]{.underline}** to
Riyadh **[that the blank check this administration has given them is no
more]{.underline}**, but **[it would]{.underline}** also **[make
it]{.underline}** practically **[impossible for the Saudis to continue
bombing Yemeni civilians]{.underline}**. As Riedel says, "The Royal
Saudi Air Force (RSAF) is entirely dependent on American and British
support for its air fleet of F-15 fighter jets, Apache helicopters, and
Tornado aircraft. If either Washington or London halts the flow of
logistics, the RSAF will be grounded." Supporters of the war on Yemen
often say that U.S. military assistance is "modest" or "limited" as a
way of minimizing our government's role, but they usually neglect to
mention how critical it is to the coalition's operations. **[If the U.S.
withdrew support from the Saudi coalition, they would not be able to
continue their war and would have to come to terms with the reality of
failure]{.underline}**. The longer that the U.S. keeps propping up their
war effort, the longer the war drags on needlessly and the more Yemeni
civilians suffer and die for no good reason.

### Terror Turn 

#### If we really want to fight terrorism we have to reduce arms sales---US arms allow Saudis to indirectly sponsor Al Qaeda.

Daniel L. **Byman** **16** \[Senior Fellow - Foreign Policy, Center for
Middle East Policy\], 5-24-2016, \"The U.S.-Saudi Arabia
counterterrorism relationship,\" Brookings,
<https://www.brookings.edu/testimonies/the-u-s-saudi-arabia-counterterrorism-relationship/>
{OS}

**[Saudi Arabia considers Al Qaeda to be a mortal enemy, yet its
military campaign in Yemen has indirectly assisted the
group.]{.underline}** By targeting and pushing back the Houthis in
Yemen, which Riyadh considers (largely erroneously) to be a pawn of
Tehran, **[Saudi Arabia has given breathing space to
AQAP]{.underline}**, which also is fighting the Houthis. Recently,
however, Saudi-backed forces have focused on AQAP as well as the
Houthis, forcing AQAP to retreat in several areas.\[27\]

### No Impact WMD Terror 

#### No internal link---It's incredibly unlikely that terrorists acquire nuclear weapons.

Stephen **Hummel** **16** \[Prolific writer and scholar at the
Combatting Terrorism Center at West Point; countless publications in his
name\], 01-xx-2016, \"The Islamic State and WMD: Assessing the Future
Threat -- Combating Terrorism Center at West Point,\" Combating
Terrorism Center at West Point,
<https://ctc.usma.edu/the-islamic-state-and-wmd-assessing-the-future-threat/>
{OS}

Among WMD, **[nuclear weapons cause the largest amount of destruction,
yet they are the most difficult to develop or obtain]{.underline}**.
**[To develop a nuclear weapon, the Islamic State would first require
enough fissile materiala to support a sustained chain
reaction]{.underline}**. The specific quantity required is determined by
the weapon design, but **[generally involves several kilograms of highly
enriched uranium]{.underline}**. **[The other]{.underline}** significant
**[limiting factor is the scores of physicists, engineers, and
metallurgists required to construct the device]{.underline}**.
**[Fighting]{.underline}** over the past five years **[throughout Iraq
and Syria has created an intellectual drain in the
region.]{.underline}** [In the distant chance that the Islamic State
could assemble nuclear scientists to develop the weapon**, it would have
to conduct tests on weapon designs**]{.underline} and construction
methods in order **[to confirm that a nuclear detonation would actually
occur]{.underline}** in the final device.b **[These tests would easily
be detected by]{.underline}** intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance assets (**[ISR]{.underline}**), **[which
would]{.underline}** presumably **[trigger a]{.underline}** kinetic
**[response from other parties]{.underline}**.

### No Oil Impact 

#### The US doesn't need Saudi for oil anymore.

Lin **Noueihed et al 18** \[She has reported on the Middle East for 12
years, initially for Lebanon's Daily Star and Middle East International,
and later as a Reuters correspondent\], Zainab Fattah, Anthony Dipaola,
Mark Niquette, 10-15-2018, \"Oil, Debt and Iran: Weapons in Any
U.S.-Saudi Fight Over Khashoggi,\" Bloomberg,
<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-15/oil-debt-and-iran-weapons-in-any-u-s-saudi-row-over-khashoggi>
{OS}

Trump has said it would be "foolish" to cancel arms deals over the
Khashoggi case and that any measures taken should not jeopardize Saudi
weapons contracts with the likes of Boeing Co., Lockheed Martin Corp.
and Raytheon Co., which could put jobs at risk. [If the U.S.
abandoned]{.underline} what he [estimated]{.underline} as some [\$110
billion in arms sales to the kingdom, the Saudis would turn to Russia
and China instead]{.underline}, he said.

The president must also contend with the Senate, however, where some are
urging a block on future arms sales to the kingdom. Analysts said
military hardware deals could face growing scrutiny from Congress, as
could U.S. support for the war in Yemen.

[Though the Saudis can take their money elsewhere]{.underline}, Ian
Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group consultancy, said [they'd want
U.S. weapons as that would keep their respective systems
integrated.]{.underline}

**["With the U.S. as the world's largest oil producer, the relationship
is even more imbalanced than it was before,"]{.underline}** Bremmer said
in an email. **["There's not much the Americans need from the
Saudis]{.underline}**. The reverse is not true."

### No Iran Impact 

#### The chance that the US can influence Saudi to patch up relations with Iran is incredibly unlikely.

Lin **Noueihed et al 18** \[She has reported on the Middle East for 12
years, initially for Lebanon's Daily Star and Middle East International,
and later as a Reuters correspondent\], Zainab Fattah, Anthony Dipaola,
Mark Niquette, 10-15-2018, \"Oil, Debt and Iran: Weapons in Any
U.S.-Saudi Fight Over Khashoggi,\" Bloomberg,
<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-15/oil-debt-and-iran-weapons-in-any-u-s-saudi-row-over-khashoggi>
{OS}

Yet **[that would mark a seismic shift in regional policy and analysts
say it's extremely unlikely]{.underline}**. **[Saudi]{.underline}**
Arabia **[has spent billions]{.underline}** of dollars **[pushing back
against what it says is growing Iranian influence in
Yemen]{.underline}** \-- where a more than three-year Saudi-led
offensive has contributed to the country's descent into humanitarian
disaster \-- as well as Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.

"Saudi is unlikely to take any retaliatory steps," said Gerges. It's
"waging battles on multiple fronts against Iran in the region and needs
American and British support not just in military and arms but also in
terms of the security umbrella. The Saudis would be left on their own."

#### Iran is a defensive realist nation---it is unlikely to strike unnecessarily and start war.

Rusty **Treviño 13** \[University of New Mexico\]. \"Is Iran an
Offensives Realist or a Defensive Realist? A Theoretical Reflection on
Iranian Motives for Creating Instability.\" Journal of Strategic
Security 6, no. 3 Suppl. (2013): 382-392.
<https://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.ecosia.org/&httpsredir=1&article=1328&context=jss>
{OS}

After **[examining Iran\'s actions and capabilities]{.underline}**, the
**[findings clearly indicate that Iran is acting in a defensive
manner]{.underline}** to protect against conventional invasion. While
**[Iran has supported exporting Islamic Revolution]{.underline}**,
Shiite takeover of States, **[and State interference]{.underline}**
through militias and terrorist groups; all **[these actions do not
create a network of offensive capabilities to become a hegemony they
merely allow Iran to create]{.underline}** crippling **[instability in
the case of war or invasion]{.underline}**. **[Iran\'s nuclear program
is geared towards having a nuclear capability, not a nuclear weapon.
This shows a fixation on deterrence of traditional State
invasion]{.underline}**. Much of **[Iran\'s military
capabilities]{.underline}** could be considered irregular and **[is
geared to resistance]{.underline}**, not invasion. Another finding is
increased repression of traditional regime stake-holders, most notably
reformers, elected officials, and leftist clerics; it appears that a new
regime of an altered State power structure has replaced the above actors
with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and its affiliates.
The term regime no longer refers to clerical bodies and elected
officials, but to the IRGC with support from the Ayatollah. In this
deal, the Ayatollah is given protection from competing State entities
and the ability to continue administering the country as he sees fit, in
exchange the IRGC continues to receive huge chunks of the Iranian
economy that they use to enrich themselves. Meaning, **[the focus of
the]{.underline}** new **[regime is defense and survival in order to
continue their goals, not expansion]{.underline}**. Continuing
containment and disruption is recommended and military action is
discouraged.

### Turn -- Iran 

#### Reducing arms to Saudi creates a window for rising Iranian aggression --- this would lead to war between the US and Iran.

experience covering military issues for multiple outlets\], 6-27-2019,

**[Nobody wants]{.underline}** to see **[a war]{.underline}** break out

**[and]{.underline}** **[Iran.]{.underline}** But **[cutting

aggressive as the Trump administration keeps the pressure on that
regime]{.underline}**. A **[strong]{.underline}**er
**[Saudi]{.underline}** Arabia, on the other hand, **[leaves Iran less
room to maneuver]{.underline}**. In the Middle East, America must often
choose between a number of options that are less than ideal. **[Sticking
with the Saudis is the least bad option the United States has at this
time]{.underline}**.
