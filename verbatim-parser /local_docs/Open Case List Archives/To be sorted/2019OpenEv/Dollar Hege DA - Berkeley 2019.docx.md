[[Being]{.mark}]{.underline} and remaining [[a reserve currency
is]{.mark} closely [tied to four broad factors]{.mark}: the [amount of
non-domestic debt]{.mark} denominated in your currency, the
[value]{.mark} and volume [of cross-border]{.mark} contractual
[obligations]{.mark} which designate your currency as the medium of
exchange, the [amount of currency reserves in issue]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} perhaps an arcane proposition in a fiat currency world,
[the international desirability of your currency]{.mark} as a store of
value. The [US dollar currently commands this privilege]{.mark}. It was
by no means the first reserve currency]{.underline}; the Roman Denari
was used throughout their empire in ancient times, during the middle
ages, the Venetian Ducato and Florentine Florin gained credence. [The US
dollar's predecessor, Sterling, achieved its time in office as a result
the decline of French dominance after the Napoleonic Wars. British trade
flourished and with it the merchants' needs finance.]{.underline} The
discount houses of Lombard Street, insurance brokers of Lloyd's coffee
house and even the stock jobbers' of Change Alley swiftly responded,
[creating the necessary financial instruments for Sterling to emerge as
the preeminent currency of international trade and finance]{.underline}.
You will note that trade followed by finance, for that is how the
relationship began, with trade as the master and finance the servant.
The passing of the baton from the UK to the US resulted from two
disastrous and expensive world wars and the subsequent demise of British
Empire and influence. As part of the Bretton Woods agreement, under the
gold exchange standard, the US dollar became the instrument of
conversion whilst it was pegged to gold at US\$35/oz. By the 1960s,
however, cracks were beginning to show. These economic conflicts between
short-term, domestic and long-term, international objectives, for the
manager of the reserve currency, were first defined by Robert Triffin.
In 1971 Triffin's dilemma became reality with the collapse of the
Bretton Woods agreement. [[Oil,]{.mark} notionally blamed for the
collapse, was, by this stage, [no longer priced in Sterling but in US
dollars.]{.mark} Gold was gone but the vast trade in oil allowed the US
dollar to retain its position through its sheer volume of
transactions.]{.underline} [[A mixture]{.mark} of inertia (what
economists call a network externality), military might and relative
value (when compared with more inflation-bent regimes) [rendered the US
dollar still supreme]{.mark}.]{.underline} In a 2016 essay for
Brookings - The dollar's international role: An "exorbitant privilege"?
former Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke, highlighted the following
[factors which have allowed the Dollar to maintain its
position:]{.underline} [Stability of value. Since the mid-1980s, the Fed
has done a good job keeping inflation low and stable. Liquidity. U.S.
financial markets, especially the U.S. Treasury market, are the deepest
and most liquid in the world... Safety. Despite Congressional
shenanigans surrounding the debt limit, there is a large supply of
dollar assets considered to be very safe, including Treasury
securities... Lender of last resort. [The Fed served as a backstop
provider of dollars during the financial crisis by instituting currency
swaps with fourteen central banks, including four in emerging
markets]{.mark}.]{.underline} Whilst many years of research has been
undertaken in an attempt to calculate the value of being the reserve
currency, Barry Eichengreen description is most succinct: \"It costs
only a few cents for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to produce a
\$100 bill, but other countries had to pony up \$100 of actual goods in
order to obtain one.\"

I discussed much of the history of how the U.S. dollar became the de
facto standard of trade in my previous articles on this topic. In short,
it began following the Nixon shock of the early 1970s when, after
removing the direct convertibility between the U.S. dollar and gold, the
President Richard Nixon sent Henry Kissinger to Saudi Arabia to barter a
deal meant to strengthen the U.S. dollar, which was falling quickly
against other currencies at the time. Eventually, [[a deal was
reached]{.mark} in which [the Kingdom would require all transactions
for]{.mark} its [oil to be conducted in]{.mark} U.S. [dollars and the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [would supply it with weapons]{.mark} and
protection]{.underline}. [As Saudi Arabia was the largest exporter of
oil in the world at the time[, other oil producers followed suit]{.mark}
for convenience. [This forced oil-importing countries to buy
dollars]{.mark} on the foreign exchange market in order to pay for the
oil that they import. [It]{.mark} also [resulted in oil-exporting
nations accumulating stockpiles of U.S. dollars,]{.mark} [which]{.mark}
[were]{.mark} then [used to purchase U.S. Treasury securities.]{.mark}
[This]{.mark} system thus had the desired effect of [boosting the value
of the]{.mark} U.S. [dollar above]{.mark} where it would otherwise be
based on fundamentals and lowering interest rates in the United
States.]{.underline} Thus, the artificial demand for U.S. dollars and
Treasury assets has bestowed a unique privilege on the nation\'s
economy.

has been considered the world's reserve currency,]{.underline}** i.e.
the money held by foreign banks to back up their own currency. However,
a number of recent events have caused some analysts to begin questioning
whether that dominance will continue for foreseeable future. These
events include murmurings from the Chinese government that they want a
new reserve currency to be created based on a basket of currencies and
whispers from some Middle Eastern oil barons that they would like to
start pricing oil in Euros instead of dollars. While no one can say for
certain what the future will bring and how governments of the world will
treat the dollar going forward, there are a number of precedents that
can be instructive in helping us understand what could happen if the
worst happens and the dollar is suddenly uncoupled from the world
economy as the world reserve currency. Note that this would be a worst
case scenario where there was a sudden change rather than a gradual one.
Given the Federal Reserve's penchant for simply printing more
moneywhenever there is a need to borrow additional cash, the value of
the dollar once it has been removed as the world's reserve currency
would plummet dramatically against other world currencies. This would
have a number of effects on the American economy and way of life. 7
Economic Consequences of a Dollar Collapse 1) Bank run. The first thing
that is likely to happen in such an event is **[that [there will be a
bank run]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as there was after the stock market
crash in 1929. **[With [dollars]{.mark} suddenly [falling rapidly in
value, people]{.mark} will]{.underline}** try to **[[withdraw their
money]{.mark} and change it to something else]{.underline}** quickly
**[before it becomes worthless.]{.underline}** 2) Capital controls.
Next, the **[[government]{.mark} would pass laws to [restrict the
ability]{.mark}]{.underline}** of private citizens **[[to
convert]{.mark} their dollars]{.underline}** into foreign currencies.
This would be done in order **[to "protect" the dollar]{.underline}** so
that it doesn't fall any further. 3) Rising unemployment. Unfortunately,
because we live in a globalized economy, protecting the dollar in this
way could lead to severe problems at home. **[[Unemployment could
rise]{.mark} dramatically as manufacturers find it impossible to
purchase]{.underline}** needed **[[parts]{.underline}]{.mark}** from
other parts of the world, **[which would be [prohibitively
expensive]{.mark}.]{.underline}** 4) **[[Soaring]{.mark} consumer
[prices]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Similarly, **[retail sales would
suffer]{.underline}** as imported goods become pricier. 5) Food
scarcity. **[[Scarce food suppli]{.mark}es]{.underline}** **[could set
in]{.underline}** as well because the cost of **[purchasing [food is
tied]{.mark} in large part [to]{.mark} the price of [oil]{.mark}, which
would now have to be purchased with expensive foreign
currency.]{.underline}** 6) Public riots. In extreme cases, **[rioting
could ensue and [martial law could be imposed]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
order to restore order.

#### Retrenchment leads to U.S. wars with NoKo, China, Russia, and Iran \-- goes nuclear

If strategy is the calculated relation of means to ends, then today
**[America is careening toward strategic insolvency]{.underline}**.
Following the Cold War, the United States possessed unrivaled military
primacy, both globally and in all the world's key strategic theaters.
Yet today, **[Washington faces military challenges that are both more
severe and more numerous than at any time in decades]{.underline}**,
precisely as its own defense cutbacks have significantly reduced U.S.
military capabilities. **[[The]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[confronts]{.mark} challenges from [revisionist]{.mark} great
[powers]{.mark} such as China and Russia, [aggressive rogue states such
as Iran and North Korea, and]{.mark} international [terrorist
organizations]{.mark} such as al-Qaeda and the Islamic
State]{.underline}**. At the same time, **[constant-dollar defense
spending fell from \$768 billion in 2010 to \$595 billion in
2015]{.underline}**, the fastest drawdown---in percentage terms---since
the Korean War. **[The result has been a creeping crisis of American
military primacy, as the margin of superiority to which the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[has become accustomed
has diminished, and a growing gap between U.S. commitments and
capabilities has emerged]{.underline}**.

This state of **[[strategic insolvency]{.mark} poses numerous dangers to
both the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and the
broader international order that American grand strategy has
traditionally supported]{.underline}**. **[It [will undermine]{.mark}
U.S. [alliances]{.mark}, by [creating]{.mark} new [doubts
regarding]{.mark} the credibility of Washington's
[guarantees]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[It will [undercut
deterrence]{.mark}, by [tempting]{.mark} adversaries such as [Russia,
China, and Iran to calculate that the]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[may be]{.mark} unwilling---or [unable]{.mark}---[to oppose
aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[It will make for far harder fights
should conflict erupt in key areas from Europe to the Middle East to
East Asia, and it may ultimately result in a situation in which
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[simply cannot defend countries it has pledged to
defend]{.underline}**. The United States would currently face grave
difficulties defending the Baltic states from a Russian assault, for
instance; **[the military balance around Taiwan and]{.underline}**
elsewhere **[in East Asia has]{.underline}** also **[eroded
dramatically]{.underline}**. Finally, **[as U.S. military power becomes
less imposing, U.S. [diplomacy is likely to encounter greater
difficulties]{.mark} as well]{.underline}**. American officials
continually aver that the U.S. military is the finest fighting force in
the history of the world, but today, **[U.S. military power has become
dangerously insufficient relative to the grand strategy and
international order it has traditionally supported]{.underline}**.

Great powers facing strategic insolvency have three basic strategic
options. First, **[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[could decrease]{.mark} its global
[commitments]{.mark}]{.underline}**, thereby bringing its strategic
obligations back into alignment with a diminished military resource
base. In practice, this might mean dispensing with U.S. security
commitments to the most geographically exposed allies and
partners---such as Taiwan and the Baltic states---in hopes of
reconsolidating a more defensible strategic perimeter. **[Yet [the
appeal]{.mark} of this option [is]{.mark} largely [illusory]{.mark}, for
even [reducing]{.mark} defense [spending will not come close to
balancing the]{.mark} U.S. federal [budget absent major changes
in]{.mark} tax and [entitlement policies]{.mark}, and U.S.
[retrenchment]{.mark} from East Asia, the Middle East, or Eastern Europe
[is likely to generate profound geopolitical
instability]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Aggressive revisionist powers
may]{.mark} well [be emboldened]{.mark} by U.S. retreat; remaining U.S.
[allies]{.mark} may [lose confidence]{.mark} in the credibility of
American defense pledges]{.underline}**. **[Retrenchment may somewhat
narrow the gap between U.S. capabilities and commitments in the short
run, but only at the likely price of a further erosion of the global
order that U.S. strategy has been meant to defend]{.underline}**.

A second option is living with greater risk. In practice, this would
mean **[either [gambling that enemies will not test]{.mark} increasingly
[precarious commitments]{.mark} or employing riskier approaches---such
as [relying on nuclear weapons]{.mark} or other escalatory
strategies---to sustain those commitments]{.underline}**. This approach
has a certain intuitive appeal---it substitutes deterrence by punishment
for deterrence by denial---and the United States indeed relied on such
approaches during the Cold War. Yet it also entails profound
liabilities. Simply hoping that exposed commitments will not be
challenged could work for a time, but this approach **[[carries enormous
risk]{.mark} that those guarantees will eventually be tested and found
wanting, [with devastating effects]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Likewise,
**[more escalatory approaches to deterrence may lack credibility---if
America is not willing to bear the fiscal costs associated with making
its defense commitments credible through conventional means, would it
really risk the astronomically higher costs associated with nuclear
escalation in a conflict over Taiwan or the Baltic
states?]{.underline}** **[This approach thus risks [leading
the]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[into a trap where]{.mark}, if its
interests are challenged, it is confronted with a choice between
pursuing [escalatory options]{.mark} that [carry a prohibitive
price]{.mark} or simply acquiescing to aggression]{.underline}**.

## \*\*Laundry Lists\*\*

#### Dollar collapse leads to a [laundry list of impacts]{.underline} -- global economic collapse, stock panic, social upheaval, governmental collapse

**Nwogu '19** (Meziechi Nwogu analyzes geopolitics, the global economy,
and the military affairs that impact our world. He works for the Medium.
https://medium.com/@meziechinwogu1/the-coming-collapse-of-the-u-s-economic-system-blame-the-u-s-dollar-b4c4238741a4)
//AFu

In my own opinion, **[[the greatest threat the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [faces]{.mark} in the 21st century is not Russia, China,
Iran, or Climate Change; but rather, [the reckless]{.mark} monetary and
[fiscal]{.mark} [policies]{.mark} of the United States. [Should
the]{.mark} U.S. [Dollar collapse]{.mark}s, [it will be]{.mark} the
single [most substantial affair in]{.mark} human [history. No
money]{.mark} in human account [has ever had an]{.mark} extraordinary
[impact globally as the]{.mark} U.S. [Dollar]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
**[All other currency crises have been regional in nature, and there
were other currencies for people to use. A U.S. Dollar collapse would be
global, and it will bring down all other fiat currencies.]{.underline}**
History is filled with sudden currency collapses. Venezuela, Zimbabwe,
Argentina, and Weimar Republic-Germany have each experienced awful
currency crises since the 1900s. The cause any currency collapse is
usually the lack of faith in the stability of the currency for trade and
exchange. As soon as users stop believing that a currency is useful, due
to inflation and low growth, that currency is in serious trouble. The
Strength of the U.S. Dollar Since the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1944,
**[governments and central banks have relied heavily on the U.S. dollar
to support the value of their currencies]{.underline}**. As a reserve
currency status, the U.S. dollar receives extraordinary acceptability in
international trade. However, the U.S. Dollar is not the only reserve
currency in the world. The British pound sterling, Euro, Japanese yen
and Chinese yuan are also members of the reserve currency club. The
rationale for the U.S Dollar to have competitors is to it create
alternatives in the event the U.S. Dollar collapses, and for the global
economy to continue humming along. The Weakness of the U.S. Dollar
**[[The weakness]{.mark} of the US dollar [is]{.mark} primarily [that it
is a fiat currency]{.mark} just like every other major global
currencies]{.underline}**. Without the discipline of the gold standard,
governments print too much money for political purposes. If the US
Federal Reserve prints too much Dollars, the value of the currency will
fall. Fortunately, apart from the United States, nearly all the reserve
currency implement similar monetary policies like the United States.
Will the U.S. Dollar Collapse? **[The question isn't if the U.S. Dollar
will collapse... but rather, when.]{.underline}** What would cause a
U.S. economic collapse? The United States cannot sustain the national
debt that it got at \$22 trillion. As the national debt continues to
increase, interest rates must go up as well. If America's debt is soo
massive, why hasn't it collapsed yet? The answer is simple: **[Major
economies]{.underline}** like Japan, China, and the European Union
**[still invest in the US economy. Also, the U.S. accurately pays off
its bonds worth trillions of dollars a year.]{.underline}** Events that
could trigger the U.S. Dollar collapse First of all, the Federal Reserve
starts to print too much paper money to pay for politicians' spending
program (Social security, Medicare, defense spending, debt servicing)
creating hyperinflation in the United States. Next, China implements its
nuclear option to dump its U.S. Treasuries holdings. China is the
world's biggest U.S. Treasury investor, owning over \$1.12 trillion. By
continuously purchasing U.S treasuries, it keeps borrowing costs very
low for U.S. companies and government. By dumping its treasury holdings,
bond yields would increase, and interest rates will rise, making it very
expensive for the U.S. government and companies to borrow fund their
operations, budget deficits, and savings shortfalls. To avoid this
problem, the Federal Reserve has been stepping in to buy U.S. Treasury
bonds. It may not be in China's interest to dump its U.S treasuries; but
it definitely has the power to do it. If China does, other US debt
holding countries could also dump their U.S. debt holdings, causing
panic. Another possible scenario is that **[[OPEC]{.mark} oil producers
[suddenly decline to sell its oil in]{.mark} US [Dollars]{.mark}. This
could [result in an absolute loss of confidence]{.mark} in the US
doll[ar, causing [the Petrodollar
system](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-a-petrodollar-3306358?source=post_page---------------------------)]{.mark}
to [collapse]{.mark}. The Petrodollar system is an exchange of crude oil
for U.S. dollars between exporters and Importers. All leading indices
and futures like the West Texas Intermediate (WTI), North Sea Brent
(Brent), and Canadian Crude Index are denominated in U.S.
Dollars.]{.underline}** Faced with stag inflation, massive debt from the
Vietnam War, massive balance of payments deficit, and excessive domestic
spending habits; **[the U.S., in 1971, ended the Gold standard for the
U.S. dollars. By 1974, [the U.S. was able to influence Saudi
Arabia]{.mark} to encourage other OPEC members [to normalize their oil
sales in]{.mark} U.S. [Dollars. In return]{.mark}, Saudi Arabia and
other Gulf states secured U.S. [military assistance]{.mark} & protection
during an increasingly volatile political climate in the region that saw
the Iran-Iraq War, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. As such, the
Petrodollar system was born.]{.underline}** The petrodollar helped lift
the U.S. Dollar to the world's leading currency. Every country that
wishes to import crude oil needs the U.S. Dollars to purchase the
commodity. This means that foreign countries have to hold large amounts
of U.S dollars. However, they have been recent challenges to the
Petrodollar system. With the decline in purchasing power of the U.S.
Dollar, China, in March 2018, launched Yuan-denominated crude oil
futures denominated in CNY (Petro-Yuan) for oil marketing for the Far
East. As the world's biggest importer of crude oil, Beijing has long
felt that pricing all its millions of barrels of imports should be
priced in Yuan. As the world's largest importer of crude oil, China saw
it as a reasonable change to price the world's most vital commodity.
What Would Happen in an Economic Collapse **[Modern [economies are
built]{.mark} mostly [on faith]{.mark}. People have confidence in the
U.S. Dollar because the U.S. economy is the biggest and most significant
economy in the world. Also, the U.S. economy frequently outperforms the
economies of Europe and Japan. The US dollar is backed up by the output
of American workers. [When people]{.mark} do [lose faith]{.mark} in the
U.S Dollar, its value will plunge, the stock market will crash, and the
U.S economy will collapse.]{.underline}** The U.S. National Debt is over
\$22 Trillion. However, the total the US total debt (debt owed by state
& local governments, Household, businesses, financial institution, and
the Federal Government) is a staggering \$74 Trillion. The point I'm
making is that this charade cannot continue much longer. China, the
European Union, India, Brazil, Russia, and other major economies are
very aware of this coming crisis. It's hard to imagine the U.S Dollar
being replaced by another currency as the world's economic standard, but
it could very well happen. It is possible to wake up one morning and see
the U.S dollar slide into a death spiral, stocks in a free fall, and
hyperinflation. **[If the U.S. Dollar and the economy collapses[, the
result will be the most significant stock market crash ever]{.mark} in
the New York Stock Exchange, probably [1000--2000 points in the first
day]{.mark}. Thus, the [major stock exchange]{.mark} in London,
Frankfurt, Tokyo, and Hong Kong will have to [suspend trading.]{.mark}
Of course, this suspension will significantly [increase]{.mark} the
[panic]{.mark} among the general population.]{.underline}** Once people
all over the world realize that they are a significant stock market
crash happening, there will be a run on banks similar to the 1930s. In
response, major financial institutions will put a freeze on most or all
banking transactions, including credit card transactions. This will
significantly increase panic. Due to the bank freeze,
**[[employers]{.mark} will be [unable to]{.mark} make bank transactions
to [pay]{.mark} their [employees]{.mark}]{.underline}**. With employers
unable to access frozen bank accounts, people won't be paid, bills won't
get paid, etc. Consequently, most businesses will be forced to either go
out of business or significantly reduce their workforce;
**[[unemployment]{.mark} will [become rampant]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
With millions out of a job, the number of **[unemployment claims will
skyrocket, [bankrupting]{.mark} unemployment [insurance]{.mark}
programs]{.underline}** in the major countries. **[When people realize
that the value of their hard earned wealth is about to evaporate, they
will take drastic measures to prevent it]{.underline}**. Those who own
stores and businesses will increase their prices for goods and services
drastically to survive the crisis. **[[Panic hoarding]{.mark} of food,
medical supplies, gasoline, heating oil, and other commodities will
erupt. Runaway inflation, gas lines, and rationing will begin.
[Widespread violence]{.mark} will explode across America]{.underline}**.
That could range from **[inner-city riots or gang wars. [The breakdown
of law and order]{.mark} will be the ultimate effect of rioting and
looting, as they lose all their sense of right and wrong and
are]{.underline}** increasingly **[empowered in their sense of anger,
panic, and greed]{.underline}**. Major **[[social
upheaval]{.underline}]{.mark}** will occur in America, and the **[fear
of the unknown]{.underline}** will set in amongst the populace. **[[The
U.S. will be hardest hit]{.mark} [because it has the largest
economy]{.mark}, an [enormous national debt]{.mark}, an [economy based
on credit, and a population greatly divided]{.mark} by race, ethnic
origin, gender, color, religious beliefs, cultural differences, and
financial status.]{.underline}**

## China Overtake

### 1NC - Version 1

#### Erosion of the dollar allows China to expand its influence---triggers [Uighur terrorism]{.underline}. 

Skylar **DRENNEN 17**. Policy Analyst, Securing America's Energy Future;
Graduate Student, Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
Studies. "What Does China's Status as Largest Oil Importer Mean for U.S.
Interests?" The Fuse. August 23.
http://energyfuse.org/what-does-china-status-as-largest-oil-importer-mean-for-us-interests/.

With the rise of one power, inevitably comes the relative weakening of
another. Losing its position as the world's undisputed long-time oil
importer does have downsides. Principally, **[the factors shifting
global power from a unipolar to a multi-polar model may threaten the
U.S.' sole-superpower position]{.underline}**. **[[The dollar has stood
as the dominant]{.mark} global [currency]{.mark} since the launch of the
Bretton Woods system, and the transition from a gold-backed dollar to
the petrodollar maintained American monetary dominance]{.underline}**.
**[Now, as oil-producing countries hold fewer U.S. treasuries, and [as
the dollar's influence is chipped away]{.mark}, the U.S.' longstanding
monetary advantage could be at risk]{.underline}**. Merely promoting the
yuan through oil payments will not create the multi-polar power
structure that China wants, but it is a strategically palatable move in
a longer-term power-play.

There will be other implications of a stronger China that will receive
mixed reactions in the U.S. **[[The U.S. will lose]{.mark} some of its
[clout in]{.mark} major [oil-producing regions]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
for better or for worse. **[China's closer diplomatic relationships with
countries that the U.S. has traditionally been the main powerful trading
partner (most [notably Saudi Arabia]{.mark}) will reduce Washington's
influence [and grant Beijing a growing role]{.mark} in global
issues]{.underline}**. This is not fully a bad outcome for the world or
for the U.S., given that it could dial back on military engagements
overseas. But **[it does mark a major change for the U.S---which would
have to adjust to no longer being the biggest name at the table in
international diplomacy]{.underline}**. In such a case, conflicts in
oil-producing countries where the U.S. has interests will gain an
additional dimension of complexity.

A Precarious Position

The most challenging aspect of increased reliance on imported oil is the
political and investment risk that comes with closer ties with
oil-producing countries. **[The Chinese strategy is complex and relies
heavily on regional organizations to solve problems]{.underline}**.
**[However in the case of the Middle East, in the era of renewed Sunni
and Shi'ite conflict, the regional powers often have diametrically
opposed agendas]{.underline}**. **[A growing footprint in conflict-prone
places may only heighten the potential for instability, forcing China to
act to protect its citizens and economic interests]{.underline}**. In
2015, China deployed its first ever peacekeeping troops to South Sudan,
and this year it opened a military base near the strategically important
Bab al-Mandab Strait in Djibouti. Reports from multiple sources also
suggest that **[Chinese patrols are operating in
Afghanistan]{.underline}** in an effort to maintain border stability in
the event that the United States pulls out.

**[If China's economy becomes more dependent on foreign oil, then the
CCP's legitimacy will]{.underline}**, in many respects, **[be tied to
the whims of the oil market]{.underline}**. As reported by Bloomberg
this year, **[[although China's major oil investments have been
constrained]{.mark} to mostly Iraq and Iran, [Saudi Arabia is moving to
win Chinese loyalty]{.mark} and investments. Saudi Aramco is currently
in talks to buy a \$2 billion and 30 percent stake in a refinery owned
by China National Petroleum Corporation]{.underline}**. This agreement
comes with hopes that the Chinese will buy major stakes in Aramco when
it commences an IPO. **[[China's oil acquisition strategy has thus far
avoided areas where the U.S. has a strong
presence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Nevertheless, as China grows more
reliant on oil from]{.underline}** Iran, Russia, **[Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}**, and Iraq, **[the task of managing a neutral
position among trading partners will become increasingly more
complex]{.underline}**. **[Tighter relationships with these producers
will bring about an increased probability of international interventions
to protect China's interests]{.underline}**. To that end, **[China risks
exposing itself to the same types of long-term risks that the U.S. has
seen from dependence on imported oil]{.underline}**.

One Belt One Road and China's future

China must grapple with these issues as it takes the not-so coveted
position as the world's top oil importer. Although one of the main
policy goals of the Chinese One Belt One Road (OBOR) policy is to
increase energy security by diversifying supply and transport routes,
**[buying more foreign oil means higher vulnerability to supply and
price shocks]{.underline}**. The OBOR policy is a massive investment
undertaking of the Chinese government to create supply chains, build
infrastructure, develop markets, and diversify energy sources across
Asia and reaching into Africa and Europe. One such approach involves
constructing a pipeline through Myanmar that bypasses the maritime
chokepoint at the Straits of Malacca. **[The OBOR initiative has
garnered significant attention for being---as one New York Times piece
commented---a "more audacious Marshall plan," aiming to build global
commerce "on China's terms."]{.underline}** The same article notes that
**[this investment plan helps spur economic growth as a means of
quelling the spread of radical Islam across China's shared border with
Pakistan]{.underline}**. **[With estimates of its Muslim inhabitants
ranging between 20 and 50 million, China has a larger Islamic population
than Syria]{.underline}**. For this reason, **[[the Chinese government
has become]{.mark} increasingly [anxious about its Uighur
population]{.mark} in the far west province of Xinjiang]{.underline}**.
**[It is possible that [by increasing its presence in the Middle
East]{.mark} [to secure oil]{.mark} supply, [China will find
partners]{.mark} that are [ideologically outraged by the way it treats
its]{.mark} own [Islamic citizens]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[There could
be a time where [China becomes]{.mark}]{.underline}** both the lead
purchaser of the oil and **[[the main target of]{.mark} state sponsored
[extremism]{.mark}]{.underline}**, a position not unfamiliar to the
United States.

#### Uighur terrorism destabilizes Central Asia.

Robert D. **KAPLAN 16**. Senior Fellow, Center for a New American
Security; Lectured at military war colleges, FBI, NSA, Pentagon's Joint
Staff, DIA, and CIA. "Eurasia\'s Coming Anarchy: The Risks of Chinese
and Russian Weakness." *Foreign Affairs* 95(March/April): 36-9. Emory
Libraries.

Then **[there are]{.underline}** the **[growing ethnic tensions in this
vast country]{.underline}**. To some degree, the Han-dominated state of
China is a prison of various nations, including the Mongols, the
Tibetans, and the Uighurs, all of whom have in varying degrees resisted
central control. Today, **[[Uighur militants represent the]{.mark} most
[immediate separatist threat]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Some have
received training in Iraq and Syria, and [as they link up with the
global jihadist movement, the danger will grow]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
In recent years, **[there has been a dramatic upsurge of bombings linked
to Uighur separatism in]{.underline}** the region of
**[Guangxi]{.underline}**, a transit point on the smuggling route
Uighurs take to Vietnam, **[proof that [terrorism will not be
confined]{.mark} to minority areas in]{.underline}** China\'s west.
**[Beijing has tried to pacify these movements with economic
development]{.underline}** for example, proposing the Silk Road Economic
Belt **[in Central Asia in order to undermine Uighur nationalism
there]{.underline}**. But **[if such immense projects
falter]{.underline}** because of China\'s own slowing economy,
**[[separatism could explode into greater
violence]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Even more so than Putin, Xi, with years of experience serving the
Communist Party in interior China, must harbor few illusions about the
depth of China\'s economic problems. But that does not mean he knows how
to fix them. **[Xi has responded to China\'s economic disarray by
embarking on an anticorruption drive, yet this campaign has primarily
functioned as a great political purge, enabling him to consolidate
China\'s national security state around his own person]{.underline}**.
**[Since decisions are no longer made as collectively as before, [Xi now
has]{.mark} greater [autonomy to channel domestic anxiety into foreign
aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In the last three decades, China\'s
leadership was relatively predictable, risk averse, and collegial.
**[But China\'s internal political situation has become far less
benign]{.underline}**.

China\'s ambitions reach further than Russia\'s, but they have generated
less concern in the West because they have been more elegantly applied.
Whereas Putin has sent thugs with ski masks and assault rifles into
eastern Ukraine, Xi\'s aggression has involved much smaller, incremental
steps, making it maddeningly difficulty for the United States to respond
without appearing to overreact. He has sent his coast guard and merchant
ships (rather than exclusively his navy) to harass Philippine warships,
dispatched an oil rig into waters claimed by both China and Vietnam (but
for only a few weeks), and engaged in land-reclamation projects on
contested islands and reefs (but ones that are devoid of people). And
since these acts of brinkmanship have taken place at sea, they have
caused no hardship for civilians and practically no military casualties.

Other Chinese moves are less subtle. Besides expanding its maritime
claims, China is building roads, railways, and pipelines deep into
Central Asia and is promising to invest tens of billions of dollars in a
transportation corridor that will stretch from western China across
Pakistan to the Indian Ocean, where China has been involved in port
projects from Tanzania to Myanmar (also called Burma). **[As China\'s
economic troubles worsen, the elegance of its aggression may wear off
and be replaced by cruder, more impulsive actions]{.underline}**. **[Xi
will find it harder to resist the urge to use Asian maritime disputes to
stoke nationalism]{.underline}**, a force that brings a measure of
cohesion to societies threatening to fragment.

Potentially adding to the danger are looming crises in the countries of
Central Asia: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and
Uzbekistan. **[The continued stability of these authoritarian countries
has made it easier for China to control its own Central Asian
minorities, but [time may be running out]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Some
of these regimes are still led by the same Brezhnev-era Central
Committee types who have ruled since the end of the Cold
War]{.underline}**. **[These leaders are now aging, their regimes enjoy
questionable legitimacy, their economies remain tied to China\'s and
Russia\'s own slowing engines, and their populations are growing more
Islamic]{.underline}**. **[[Central Asia]{.mark},]{.underline}** in
other words, **[[may be ripe for an]{.mark} Arab Spring-like
[eruption]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

#### That goes nuclear.

Fronts For Russia: How Washington Will Fan The Flames of Chaos In
Central Asia." Information Clearinghouse. February 23.

Method of destruction

**[[The first way to destabilize Central Asia is to create problems on
the borders]{.underline}]{.mark}**, along with the threat that
Mujahideen will penetrate the region. The testing of the neighbours has
already started; problems have arisen in Turkmenistan, which has even
had to ask Kabul to hold large-scale military operations in the border
provinces. Tajikistan has forced the Taliban to negotiate the release of
the border guards it abducted, and the Tajik border service reports that
there is a large group of Mujahideen on its borders.

In general, all the countries bordering Afghanistan have stepped up
their border security.

**[[The second way is to send Islamists behind the
lines]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The process has already begun: the number
of extremists in Tajikistan alone grew three-fold last year; however,
even though they are being caught, it obviously will not be feasible to
catch all of them. Furthermore, the situation is aggravated by the
return of migrant workers from Russia, which will expand the recruiting
base. If the stream of remittances from Russia dries up, the outcome may
be popular discontent and managed riots.

Kyrgyz expert Kadir Malikov reports that \$70 million has been allocated
to the IS military group Maverenahr, which includes representatives of
all the Central Asian republics, to carry out acts of terrorism in the
region. Special emphasis is placed on the Fergana Valley as the heart of
Central Asia.\
Another point of vulnerability is Kyrgyzstan's parliamentary elections,
scheduled for this fall. The initiation of a new set of color
revolutions will lead to chaos and the disintegration of countries.

Self-supporting wars

Waging war is expensive, so the destabilization of the region must be
self-supporting or at least profitable for the U.S. military-industrial
complex. And in this area Washington has had some success: it has given
Uzbekistan 328 armored vehicles that Kiev had requested for its war with
Novorossiya. At first glance, the deal isn't profitable because the
machines were a gift, but in reality Uzbekistan will be tied to U.S.
spare parts and ammunition. Washington made a similar decision on the
transfer of equipment and weapons to Islamabad.

But the United States has not been successful in its attempts to impose
its weapons systems on India: the Indians have not signed any contracts,
and Obama was shown Russian military hardware when he attended a
military parade.

Thus the United States is drawing the countries in the region into war
with its own protégés -- the Taliban and Islamic State -- and at the
same time is supplying its enemies with weapons.

So **[2015 will be marked by preparations [for widespread
destabilization in Central Asia]{.mark}]{.underline}** and the
transformation of AfPak into an Islamic State subsidiary **[[on the
borders of Russia, India, China, and Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
start of **[[full-scale war]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[which
[will]{.mark} inevitably [follow once chaos engulfs the
region]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[will lead to a bloodbath in the
"Eurasian Balkans," automatically [involving]{.mark} more than [a third
of the world's population and]{.mark} almost all the
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates'
**[[geopolitical rivals]{.mark}. It's an opportunity Washington will
find too good to miss.]{.underline}**

Russia's response to this challenge has to be multifaceted: involving
the region in the process of Eurasian integration, providing military,
economic, and political assistance, working closely with its allies in
the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the BRICS, strengthening the
Pakistani army, and of course assisting with the capture of the bearded
servants of the Caliphate.

But the most important response should be the accelerated modernization
of its armed forces as well as those of its allies and efforts to
strengthen the Collective Security Treaty Organization and give it the
right to circumvent the highly inefficient United Nations.

**[The region is extremely important]{.underline}**: **[if Ukraine is a
fuse of war, then [Central Asia is a munitions depot. If it blows up,
half the continent will be hit]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

### 1NC - Version 2

#### Collapse of US dollar hegemony paves the road for China---allies will follow suit

**Moore '18** (3/1/18, Jeffrey Moore II \|\| journalist for the OZY \|\|
Can Emperor Yuan Dethrone King Dollar As the World\'s Currency?, OZY
\|\|
https://www.ozy.com/acumen/can-emperor-yuan-dethrone-king-dollar-as-the-worlds-currency/83877)

China's meteoric rise over the past half-century is one of the most
striking examples of the impact of opening up an economy to global
markets that the world has ever seen. Over that period, the country has
shifted from a largely agrarian society to an industrial powerhouse,
lifting nearly a billion people out of poverty and reshaping the world's
economic landscape. In the process, it has seen sharp increases in
productivity and wages that have allowed China to become the world's
second-largest economy.

But for President Xi Jinping, second place is not good enough to achieve
the "Chinese Dream." [[A key obstacle preventing the P]{.mark}eople's
[R]{.mark}epublic from reaching the summit of the economic mountain
[is]{.mark} King [Dollar]{.mark} --- the world's dominant global
currency]{.underline}. In 2018, China could seek to dethrone King Dollar
by forcing yuan-denomination of specific commodities, marking a
cataclysmic shift in the world financial order that's been in place
since World War II. For example:

As the world's No. 1 oil importer, China may have the leverage to demand
such a dollar-to-yuan switch, which would directly influence nearly 40
percent of global oil production and create a massive oversupply of U.S.
dollars. [And [China changing to yuan]{.mark}-denominated oil contracts
is significant because it [could]{.mark} begin to unravel the U.S.
dollar's dominance worldwide and, in turn, [lessen the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tate[s' ability to wield]{.mark} the [soft power associated
with currency leverage.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The saying [["the bigger they are, the harder they
fall"]{.underline}]{.mark} is relevant here because the U.S. dollar is
immense --- it makes up 64 percent of known central bank foreign
exchange reserves; more than 85 percent of world forex trading (the
decentralized over-the-counter trading in foreign currencies); and 39
percent of all debt issued in the world. In addition, more than
one-third of world GDP comes from countries whose currencies are pegged
to the dollar. The sudden fall of King Dollar would be very hard indeed.
It would lead to massive inflation in the U.S., threatening the smooth
function of debt markets that make the financial world go round.

And what are the black swans --- low-probability, high-impact events ---
that could trigger such a global disruption? Key developments over the
course of 2018 could accelerate the onset of a previously dismissed
yuan-denominated future, especially in Asia. If the U.S. decides not to
respond to belligerent threats of a nuclear North Korea, for example,
[[So]{.mark}uth [Ko]{.mark}rea [and Japan could conclude China would be
a better security guarantor]{.mark} [and]{.mark} demonstrate their new
allegiance by dumping dollars and [adopt]{.mark}ing [more
yuan.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Or could a gray rhino --- an unforeseen event that's less stealthy than
a black swan but still camouflaged --- overturn the old order? After
all, [[China is already]{.mark} making moves to [dethrone the
dollar.]{.mark} In late July, [China proposed pricing oil in yuan to
Saudi Arabia.]{.mark}]{.underline} China has been reducing Saudi
Arabia's share of its total imports, which fell from 25 percent in 2008
to 15 percent in 2016. Chinese oil imports rose 13.8 percent
year-on-year during the first half of 2017, but supplies from Saudi
Arabia inched up just 1 percent year-on-year. With the U.S. increasingly
becoming energy independent, Saudi Arabia may have no other option than
to yield to yuan-denominated oil in order to keep its biggest customer.

If that happens, the threat to the dollar's hegemony would not be
well-received in Washington, D.C., and the U.S. government could suspend
weapons sales to the kingdom. The knock-on political risks of switching
from petro-dollar to petro-yuan are alarming. Despite globalwide
skepticism, Chinese media report that the plan for yuan-oil contracts is
moving swiftly.

And that's just oil, of which China consumes approximately 12 percent
globally, according to the World Economic Forum. While oil is the
lifeblood of any industrial economy, the share of global consumption by
China in other commodities is even higher, including more than half of
all aluminum and nearly half of all steel and copper.

Some experts believe that changing the world's working currency would
occur at a glacial pace. In fact, it could happen overnight in response
to geopolitical conflagrations. Like pressure building, undetected
beneath fault lines, an unexpected and sudden release could send King
Dollar hurtling off its throne, with Emperor Yuan ready and waiting to
take its spot. Such is the nature of black swans.

#### Chinese dollar hegemony harms the economy and national security

The renminbi had a market share of less than 1% in 2009 but that share
has been steadily growing where it has now reached a market share of 18%
by mid-2014. In comparison the market share of the US dollar is nearly
65%. In early 2013, the renminbi had ranked 12th place but by March
2014, the renminbi had climbed to seventh, behind the dollar, euro,
pound, yen, and the Australian and Canadian dollars when ranked by value
of payments made in that currency. Another measurement of the renminbi'
s acceptance is the number of global financial institutions doing
business in the yuan. It has grown from a meagre 1000 in 2010 to over
10,000 in 2014. These numbers reflect the yuan gains as the Chinese
economy continues to grow and more countries continue to sign agreements
in currency trades. [[Chinese currency manipulation]{.mark} and the
clandestine gold purchases by China (and now Russia) [is likely to
aggravate the currency war looming on the horizon]{.mark}.]{.underline}
In closing, I reiterate that Chinese currency manipulation and the
clandestine gold purchases by China (and now Russia) are likely to
aggravate the currency war looming on the horizon. [[This will]{.mark}

international currencies to purchase oil replacing the dominance of the
Petrodollar. The combined policies of US Federal Reserve and the US
Treasury are [leading the nation towards an economic and national
security precipice.]{.mark}]{.underline} Jim Rickards said in a US
Treasury meeting that "The Fed and the Treasury are the greatest threats
to national security, not Al- Qaeda."

It's safe to say that the EU, **[[the US, and]{.mark} quite a few
[other]{.mark} jurisdiction[s]{.mark} are [nearing currency
crashes]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and in all likelihood, the euro will go
before the dollar. So, unless the EU has already prearranged a new euro,
the US dollar might well be chosen as an immediate solution to the
problem, as the US dollar is presently recognised and traded throughout
Europe. Therefore, a relatively painless transfer could be made.
However, the dollar, which is presently praised as being a sound
currency, is really only sound in relation to the euro (and some other
lesser currencies). **[Once its less stable brother, the euro,
collapses, the dollar will be exposed]{.underline}**. As **[[the US
dollar is]{.mark} a fiat currency and is [on the
ropes]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the US (and any other country that is
using the dollar as its primary currency when the time comes) will
experience a currency emergency at the street level that will be
unprecedented. The big question that is generally not being discussed
is: The day after the crash (and thereafter), what will be the currency
that is used to buy a bag of groceries, a tank of petrol, a meal at a
restaurant? Certainly, **[[the need will]{.mark} be immediate and will
[be on a national level]{.mark} in each impacted country,]{.underline}**
affecting everyone. I have discussed for some time that the US will be
prepared ahead of time with a new, electronic currency. This will serve
three purposes: It will allow the US government to blame paper
currencies for the crash, in order to distract the public from
recognizing that the government itself is the culprit. It will allow the
US government to create a currency system that disallows the holding of
tradable currency by the population---that is, a debit card would be
created by banks through which all transactions must pass, assuring that
all transactions are processed by (and thereby subject to the control
of) a bank. It will allow the US government to have knowledge of every
penny earned and spent by any individual or organization, allowing for
direct-debit income taxation. If the US does institute such a system, US
citizens will then become the most economically controlled people in the
world, overnight. It's likely that a black-market system would
spontaneously be created by US citizens in order to bypass the new
government system. A portion of daily trade would occur under the table.
It would unquestionably be made illegal, and we can only speculate as to
how prevalent it would become: 10% of all transactions? 30%? Anyone's
guess. Certainly, the government would crack down, and penalties might
become severe. Elsewhere in the world, there would be greater freedom,
but what would their currencies be? There are many countries that
presently use the US dollar as one of their official currencies. After a
crash, the greater the link to the US dollar, the greater the loss of
economic freedom, although, in most such countries, the government is
likely to be less efficient than in the US, which would work in favour
of the individual. **[Such countries would also have the option of
switching from the dollar to another dominant currency]{.underline}**.
With the euro and dollar gone, **[[that currency]{.mark} might be [the
Chinese yuan]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} The difficulty with this
possibility is that, presently, the yuan is not in common use on the
street. **[[Adoption of a currency]{.mark} such as the yuan [would
require a sudden switch]{.mark} in monetary policy]{.underline}**,
complete with teething problems. However, **[[recent developments
amongst]{.mark} the [BRICS]{.mark} and others [indicate]{.mark} that
[many countries are]{.mark} already [seeing the writing on the

### EX - AT Trade War Thumps

#### No trade war thumpers---Chinese currency still popular even then

more popular as reserve currency despite trade war, IMF data shows,
South China Morning Post \|\|
https://www.scmp.com/business/money/wealth/article/2166652/chinas-yuan-more-popular-reserve-currency-despite-trade-war)

Central banks around the globe are investing in more Chinese yuan as
part of their foreign exchange reserves, with the currency moving up one
notch in the global league table of central bank holdings.

Despite the progress, however, the yuan's share of total reserves
remains modest and well behind that of the "big three" currencies -- the
US dollar, the euro and the Japanese yen -- as a reserve asset.

The share of China's yuan in global central bank reserves rose one
position, overtaking Australia's dollar, to take sixth place among all
currencies, despite mounting US-China trade tensions and a decline in
the yuan exchange rate, according to the latest data from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Some central banks see the uncertainty emanating from the trade war as
temporary only, and remain positive over China's long-term outlook

[[Holdings of yuan assets]{.mark} by global central banks
[increased]{.mark} for a fourth straight quarter [to US\$193.4 billion
in the second quarter]{.mark} of this year, [to 1.84 per cent of
all]{.mark} reserve [assets,]{.mark} the IMF data shows.]{.underline}

That compares with the yuan's 1.40 per cent share in the first quarter,
1.23 per cent at the end of 2017 and 1.07 per cent at the end of 2016.

["Some [central banks see the]{.mark} uncertainty emanating from the
[trade war as temporary]{.mark} only, [and remain positive]{.mark} over
China's long-term outlook," said Chris Leung, China & Hong Kong
economist at DBS Bank. "[They]{.mark} may [actually]{.mark} be
[add]{.mark}ing [to their yuan holdings because the currency has
fallen]{.mark} so much, [making it]{.mark} a [cheap]{.mark}
investment."]{.underline}

In the second quarter, the yuan's value slid 5.2 per cent against the US
dollar, as the greenback rose due in part to the continued interest rate
increases by the US Federal Reserve.

The yuan's share of total currency reserves remains modest and well
behind that of the "big three" -- the US dollar, the euro and the
Japanese yen -- as a reserve asset.

But the yuan still has a long way to go to match, let alone replace, the
US dollar or even the euro or yen, as the world's favourite reserve
currency. Reserve holdings in the yuan remains well behind the big three
in terms of volume.

The share of US dollar reserves of global central banks shrank to 62.25
per cent in the second quarter, its lowest level since 2013, while the
euro was in second place at 20.26 per cent and the yen in third place at
4.97 per cent.

[As China's central bank props up yuan, [the risk of depreciation
falls]{.mark}]{.underline}

Global central banks have been gradually increasing the share of yuan in
their foreign exchange reserve holdings since the IMF included it in its
Special Drawing Rights currency basket, officially making it a world
reserve currency, on November 30, 2015.

As a payment currency for domestic and international merchandise trade,
the yuan kept its position as the fifth most active currency by value in
August 2018, with a share of 2.12 per cent, according to data from
global payments messaging system, SWIFT.

History shows that, while it is tempting to sail alone, countries must
resist the siren call of self-sufficiency -- because as the Greek
legends tell us, that leads to shipwreck

Overall, the value of yuan payments increased by 2.18 per cent from
July, whilst in general all payments currencies decreased by 1.36 per
cent.

That compares to the US dollar, which accounted for 39.69 per cent of
transactions in August, the euro for 34.13 per cent and the pound for
6.88 per cent.

The rapid escalation in the US-China trade friction appears to be
spurring China to take stops to accelerate the internationalisation
process of the yuan, also known as the renminbi.

Last week Chinese President Xi Jinping also said the trade war was
forcing China to rely more on itself for development, and that "it's not
a bad thing".

Is China an open economy? Beijing says it is but IMF differs

However Christine Lagarde, the IMF's managing director, on Monday warned
that countries should work together to resolve the current trade
disputes, and to build a global trade system that is stronger and
fairer.

She said there were signs that global growth had plateaued, becoming
less synchronised with fewer countries taking part in the expansion.

"History shows that, while it is tempting to sail alone, countries must
resist the siren call of self-sufficiency -- because as the Greek
legends tell us, that leads to shipwreck," Lagarde said.

#### Dollar stability key to commodity prices---collapse causes massive volatility. 

Chuck **KOWALSKI 17**. Two degrees in Finance and Economics from Florida
State University. "How the Dollar Impacts Commodity Prices." The
Balance. May 5.
https://www.thebalance.com/how-the-dollar-impacts-commodity-prices-809294.

Typically, **[[there is an inverse relationship between the]{.mark}
value of the [dollar and commodity prices]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[When the dollar strengthens]{.underline}** against other major
currencies, **[the prices of commodities tend to drop]{.underline}**.
**[When the]{.underline}** value of the **[dollar weakens]{.underline}**
against other major currencies, **[the prices of
commodities]{.underline}** generally **[move higher]{.underline}**. This
is a general rule but it holds true more often than not over time.

**[If you look at a chart of the CRB index which contains a diverse
group of commodity prices against a chart of the dollar index which
represents the strength or weakness of the U.S. currency against other
foreign exchange instruments, you will notice]{.underline}** that, as a
general rule, **[when the dollar moves higher, commodities tend to move
lower]{.underline}**.

The converse occurs as the dollar moves lower. The correlation is not
perfect, but over time **[there is a significant inverse
relationship]{.underline}**.

There are many reasons why the value of the dollar influences
commodities prices. The primary reason is that **[the dollar is the
benchmark pricing mechanism for most commodities [because the
U.S.]{.mark} currency [is the reserve currency]{.mark}]{.underline}** of
the world. **[The dollar tends to be [the most stable]{.mark} foreign
[exchange]{.mark} instrument so most other nations hold dollars as
reserve assets]{.underline}**. Therefore, **[when it comes to
international trade]{.underline}** for raw materials, **[the dollar is
the exchange mechanism]{.underline}** in many, if not most cases.
**[[When]{.mark} the [value]{.mark} of the dollar [drops, it costs
more]{.mark} dollars [to buy commodities]{.mark}]{.underline}**. At the
same time, it costs a lesser amount of other currencies when the dollar
in moving lower.

Another reason is that **[commodities are global assets, they trade all
over the world]{.underline}**. **[Foreign buyers purchase U.S.
commodities such as corn, soybeans, wheat, oil, and others with
dollars]{.underline}**.

When the value of the dollar drops, they will have more buying power as
it takes less of their currencies to purchase a dollar. Classic
economics teaches that **[demand]{.underline}** typically **[increases
as prices drop]{.underline}**.

**[Commodity traders need to keep a close eye on the value of the
dollar]{.underline}**. One of the best ways to monitor the dollar is to
watch the price quotes of the Dollar Index traded on the ICE Futures
Exchange.

This futures contract is an index that values the dollar against a group
of other major currencies around the world like the euro, yen, British
pound, and other foreign exchange instruments. The price of the index is
traded like any other futures contract and moves up and down during
trading hours.

Commodity prices don't necessarily tick higher for every tick lower in
the Dollar Index, but there is a strong inverse relationship over the
long-haul. Individual commodities have fundamental supply and demand
characteristics so they move one way or another at times despite the
direction of the U.S. currency.

**[The dollar is the benchmark because it is stable]{.underline}**

Commodity prices do not trade in a vacuum. **[Commodity [production is
often]{.mark} a [localized]{.mark} affair]{.underline}**. As an example,
**[[the majority of corn and soybean production]{.underline}]{.mark}**
in the world **[[comes from]{.underline}]{.mark}** the fertile lands of
**[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates. The mineral rich soil of Chile yields
the largest output of copper on earth and half the world's oil reserves
are located in the Middle East. The largest producers of cocoa beans are
located in Africa in the Ivory Coast and Ghana. As you can see,
commodity production depends on climate and geology in specific
locations. **[[However]{.mark}, [consumption]{.mark} of these important
raw materials that are staples for all humans [occurs all over the
globe]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[When it comes to the price of commodities, the vast
majority]{.underline}** of these raw materials **[use the dollar as a
pricing mechanism for global trade]{.underline}**. That is **[because
the U.S. is the strongest and most stable economy in the
world]{.underline}**. Therefore, **[the dollar is the reserve
currency]{.underline}** of the world and the pricing mechanism for
commodities. **[When the dollar strengthens, it means that commodities
become more expensive in other non-dollar currencies]{.underline}**.
**[This tends to have a negative influence on demand]{.underline}**.
Conversely, **[when the dollar weakens, commodity prices in other
currencies move lower which increases demand]{.underline}**.

Each commodity has idiosyncratic characteristics. However,
**[[the]{.mark} value of the [dollar has a direct influence on]{.mark}
the [prices of all commodities]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In May 2014, the
dollar began to strengthen. During the month, the U.S. dollar index
traded to 78.93 on the active month futures contract.

and state vulnerability: Unpacking the link between climate variability
and violent unrest." *Journal of Peace Research* 54(3): 335-50. Emory
Libraries.

**[[There is a long history of]{.mark} sudden increases in [food
insecurity]{.mark}]{.underline}** contributing to, or **[[directly
producing, violent protests]{.underline}]{.mark}** and riots as
individuals take to the streets in response to shortages, **[dating
back]{.underline}** at leas t **[from the famous bread shortage that
ignited the French Revolution]{.underline}** (for a series of examples
in different contexts and periods, see also Brinkman & Hendrix, 2011:
7--8).7 Indeed, during **[a series of violent riots in
Somalia]{.underline}** in 2008 **[prompted by rising food prices,
one]{.underline}** participant **[summarized their
motivation]{.underline}** for taking to the streets b**[y saying: 'I've
never demonstrated before, but I'm not ashamed because if you can't eat,
you will do whatever you can]{.underline}** \[ \... \]'.8 Thus, our
theoretical focus is on the generation of **[food
insecurity]{.underline}** and how it **[translates into violent
unrest]{.underline}**. As such, our primary theoretical interest is with
food consumers.

Domestic production **[shortfalls and higher food prices translate into
food insecurity in two ways]{.underline}**. **[First, food [shortages
decrease food availability]{.mark}]{.underline}**, thus **[[imperiling
the]{.mark} basic [ability of individuals to
survive]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Second, food shortages highlight food
entitlements]{.underline}**, which Sen (1981: 459) defines as 'the
ability of different sections of the populations to establish command
over food using the entitlement relations in that society'. In other
words, **[an increase in food insecurity both challenges the ability of
people to procure food and emphasizes the existing differences in
society]{.underline}** between those that can and those that cannot do
so.

When confronting a situation of food scarcity, **[[individuals
become]{.mark} more [willing to participate in violent]{.mark}
demonstrations and [riots]{.mark}]{.underline}**, for several reasons.
First, **[shocks to food security act as a source of grievance by
denying individuals access to basic necessities]{.underline}**. Thus,
**[[scarcity]{.mark} can [generate competition and
animosity]{.mark}]{.underline}** between societal groups and between
societal groups and the state over issues of food availability. Second,
**[these shocks]{.underline}** can also **[increase existing
grievances]{.underline}**, by emphasizing food entitlements. In this
sense, **[abrupt [increases]{.mark} in food insecurity will [highlight
existing inequalities and conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}** between
different societal groups (e.g. occupational and ethnic differences).
Finally, the **[desperation that food [insecurity]{.mark} entails
[reduces]{.mark} the [perceived costs]{.mark} associated [with
violence]{.mark}]{.underline}** (see also Brinkman & Hendrix, 2011).
**[Participating in violent demonstrations, while costly, may be a
preferable alternative to not demonstrating and]{.underline}**
potentially **[being unable to feed oneself or family]{.underline}**.

The effect of food insecurity is shaped by the degree to which each
country is vulnerable to food insecurity. While these threats exacerbate
grievances and inflame existing social hierarchies by both reducing food
availability and highlighting food entitlements, as well as reducing the
relative costs of participating in violent demonstrations, the
vulnerability of the state to food insecurity plays a crucial role in
moderating food insecurity's impact on the likelihood of violence. State
vulnerability alters the calculations of individuals contemplating
participation in violent demonstrations. **[When states are especially
vulnerable, the ramifications of abrupt increases in food insecurity are
likely to be more widespread, and grievances are more likely to trigger
violence precisely because the state lacks the economic and
institutional resilience necessary to address the grievances of its
population and deter violence]{.underline}**.

Threats to food security

**[Sudden [increases]{.mark} in the threat of food insecurity -- abrupt
and dramatic reductions in the ability of individuals to access food --
are a multi-faceted outcome and may [result from]{.mark}]{.underline}**
either domestic or **[[international processes]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
To understand when and why food insecurity triggers violence, it is
essential to theorize individually its different sources, which we
consider in turn below.

**[[International]{.mark} food [prices]{.mark}]{.underline}** can
**[[affect]{.mark} the threat of [food insecurity in two
ways]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[First]{.mark}, the absolute level of
international food prices impacts the price that local customers must
pay for food]{.underline}**. **[Higher food prices increase the risk of
food insecurity because, ceteris paribus, [higher prices make it more
difficult]{.mark} for consumers [to purchase
food]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Second]{.mark}, sudden increases in the
price of food might also heighten the threat of food insecurity, by
dramatically and unexpectedly reducing the ability of consumers to
procure food]{.underline}**, thus **[[triggering shortages]{.mark} that
are [difficult]{.mark} for consumers [to anticipate and plan
for]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[There is a **growing appreciation** that]{.underline} the
[[conflicts]{.mark} in the next century [will **most likely** be fought
over]{.mark} a lack of [resources]{.mark}]{.underline}. ¶ Yet, in a
sense, [this is not new]{.underline}. [Researchers point to the
**[French and Russian revolutions]{.mark} as conflicts induced by** a
lack of food.]{.underline} More recently, [**Germany's [World War
Two]{.mark} efforts** [are]{.mark} said to have been
[inspired]{.mark}]{.underline}, at least in part, [[by]{.mark} its
perceived [need to]{.mark} gain [access]{.mark} to more
[food]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet the general sense among those that
attended FDI's recent workshops, was that [the **scale** of the problem
in the future could be **significantly greater as a result
of**]{.underline} population pressures, changing weather, urbanisation,
migration, **[loss of]{.underline}** arable land and other **[farm
inputs]{.underline}**, and increased affluence in the developing world.

In his book, Small Farmers Secure Food, [Lindsay Falvey]{.underline}, a
participant in FDI's March 2012 workshop on the issue of food and
conflict, clearly [expresses the problem]{.underline} and why countries
across the globe are starting to take note.

He writes (p.36), "...[[if people are hungry]{.underline}]{.mark},
especially in cities, **[[the state is not stable]{.mark} -- riots,
violence, breakdown of law and order and migration
result]{.underline}**." ¶ "**[Hunger feeds anarchy]{.underline}**."

This view is also shared by [Julian Cribb]{.underline}, who in his book,
The Coming Famine, [writes that if "large regions of the world run short
of food]{.underline}, land or water in the decades that lie ahead, then
**[wholesale, [bloody wars]{.mark} are liable to
[follow]{.mark}]{.underline}**."

He continues: "[[A]{.mark}n increasingly [credible scenario for **World
War 3** is]{.mark}]{.underline} not so much a confrontation of super
powers and their allies, as [a **festering, self-perpetuating chain of
[resource conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}." He also says: "The wars of
the 21st Century are less likely to be global conflicts with sharply
defined sides and huge armies, than a scrappy mass of failed states,
rebellions, civil strife, insurgencies, terrorism and genocides, sparked
by bloody competition over dwindling resources."

As another workshop participant put it, **[people do not go to war to
kill; they go to war over resources]{.underline}**, either to protect or
to gain the resources for themselves. ¶ Another observed that hunger
results in passivity not conflict. Conflict is over resources, not
because people are going hungry.

[A [**study** by]{.mark} **the [I]{.mark}**]{.underline}nternational
**[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}**eace **[[R]{.underline}]{.mark}**esearch
**[[I]{.underline}]{.mark}**nstitute [[indicates]{.mark} that where
**[food security]{.mark}** is an issue, it [is]{.mark} more [**likely**
to result in]{.mark} some form of [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[**Darfur, Rwanda, Eritrea and the Balkans** experienced]{.mark} such
[wars]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Governments]{.underline}, especially in
developed countries, [are increasingly aware of this
phenomenon]{.underline}. [The [UK Ministry of Defence]{.mark}, the
[CIA]{.mark}, the]{.underline} US **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**enter for
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**trategic and
**[[I]{.underline}]{.mark}**nternational
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tudies [[and]{.mark} the [Oslo]{.mark} Peace
Research Institute, [**all identify** famine as a]{.mark} potential
[trigger for]{.mark}]{.underline} conflicts and possibly even
**[[nuc]{.mark}lear [war]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

High food prices exacerbate food insecurity, leading to political
instability **[Recent events demonstrate how high the stakes
remain]{.underline}**. Following a 20-year period of relative stability
in world food markets, extreme price volatility marked the 2000s,
particularly the period from 2007 to the present (see Figure 1, "Food
prices and food-related protests, 1990--2015"). **[From 2007 to 2011,
high food prices swelled the ranks of the world's food
insecure]{.underline}**, with women and children most acutely affected.
Since then, **[the number of [food-insecure people]{.mark} has [trended
downward]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[[thanks]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
large part **[[to lower prices]{.mark} and increased
ag]{.underline}**riculture **[investment]{.underline}** by governments,
the private sector, and nonprofits. **[However, [we can ill afford to be
complacent]{.mark}]{.underline}** about prospects going forward, **[as
food insecurity is expected to deepen in key regions]{.underline}** if
the current trajectory holds.

**[[The]{.mark} social and economic [costs of]{.mark} these food price
[spikes were considerable]{.mark}, however the political fallout---as
well as the relationship between food and political stability it
highlights---was just as damaging]{.underline}**. **[Food price--related
[protests]{.mark}]{.underline}**, also in Figure 1, **[[toppled
governments]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Haiti and Madagascar in 2007--08.

\[Begin Box 2\] Hunger is not a necessary precondition for instability
**[Countries affected]{.underline}** by food price--related riots **[are
not just those with poor governance or where hunger]{.underline}** and
food insecurity **[are prevalent]{.underline}**. **[According to the
widely followed Fragile States Index, Egypt, Libya, and Syria were at
less risk prior to the 2010--11 food price spike than countries like
Colombia and Nigeria---and yet all three were
destabilized.]{.underline}**8 [**That high food and fuel prices were
[the]{.mark}** [**catalyst for destabilizing riots**]{.mark} **in
regimes thought to be relatively safe [implies]{.mark} that our**
**[risk-assessment tools underestimated]{.mark} the potential for [food
price]{.mark}--related [instability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. \[End Box
2\]

And [**in 2010--11, food [prices and]{.mark} food [insecurity
were]{.mark} again [implicated in]{.mark} the political turmoil and**
**[mass uprisings]{.mark} of the Arab Spring**]{.underline}. These
movements did not all begin violently, but **[once protesters were
mobilized, heavy-handed government responses often led otherwise
peaceful protests to become violent and destabilizing]{.underline}**.

**[In both periods, [countries of high strategic significance to
the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[were
affected]{.underline}]{.mark}** (see Figure 2, "Food riots 2007--11 and
current oil exports"). **[The unrest in the Middle East and North Africa
roiled energy markets: more than 20 percent of world crude and petroleum
exports pass through either the Suez Canal or the Strait of Hormuz, and
both were ringed by countries experiencing
unrest]{.underline}**.9**[¶]{.underline}** Though oil flows through
those channels were not disrupted, **[unrest in Libya and concern that
the Arab Spring would spread]{.underline}** to major Gulf oil exporters
(Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) **[pushed already
high oil prices up]{.underline}** by 15 percent in late February and
early March 2011.10

[**The resulting [instability]{.mark}** **strained Egyptian relations
with Israel and [necessitated]{.mark} a [NATO intervention in
Libya]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[The ongoing civil war in
[Syria]{.mark}---which [can be linked to]{.mark} drought, [food
insecurity]{.mark}, rapid urbanization, and exclusionary
rule]{.underline}** (see Box 1, "Important terms")---[**is exacting a
massive toll and [contributing to]{.mark}** **growing [tensions with
Russia]{.mark}, dissention over refugee resettlement among NATO partners
in Europe, and the escalation of a serious threat**]{.underline} to the
Iraqi government. Closer to US borders, soaring prices for staples like
rice and beans in Haiti led to a week of rioting in 2008 during which
five people were killed, with the violence involving both Haitian police
and UN Peacekeepers. Moreover, **[rising food prices and deteriorating
economic prospects there fueled attempts to immigrate to the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. **[As food prices shot
up]{.underline}** almost 20 percent **[in 2007, US Coast Guard
interdictions of Haitians rose 34 percent, straining US Coast Guard
resources]{.underline}**.11**[¶]{.underline}** Thus the **[food riots of
2007--11 offer very clear examples of how food insecurity and grievances
over high prices abroad affect US national security at home and stress
national security resources.]{.underline}**

for Social Policy and Development. "The global food crises." 2011 Report

http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/rwss/docs/2011/chapter4.pdf.

However, **[[the rapid]{.mark} and simultaneous [rise in prices]{.mark}
globally for]{.underline}** all **[basic food
crops]{.underline}**---corn, wheat, soybeans and rice---long with other
food items such as cooking oil **[[has]{.mark} had [a devastating
effect]{.mark} on poor people [all over the world]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(ACF International / Action Against Hunger, 2009; Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations, 2009b; Swan, Hadley and Cichon,
2010). Almost everybody's standard of living has been reduced as people
in the middle class become increasingly careful about their food
purchases, **[the near poor descend into poverty and those already poor
suffer even greater deprivations than before]{.underline}**.

**[With the increase in hunger and malnutrition, the risk of [premature
deaths]{.mark} is likely to [increase]{.mark} among the young, old,
infirm and other vulnerable people]{.underline}** and this will continue
unless conditions improve. The **[survivors are harmed in other
ways]{.underline}** as well. **[[The impact]{.mark} of the food crisis
[is]{.mark}]{.underline}** likely to be **[much [more severe]{.mark}
[among women and children]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Because of gender
discrimination and various cultural practices that influence
intrahousehold resource allocation, these groups tend to be more
vulnerable to]{.underline}** chronic and transitory **[food
insecurity]{.underline}**. Furthermore, **[the crisis may undermine
efforts to reduce maternal and infant deaths as the food and nutrition
deficits facing]{.underline}** pregnant and lactating women **[worsen in
already adversely affected regions]{.underline}**. Lack of social
protection for female workers in the informal sector compounds their
vulnerability to such external shocks.

In the majority of countries, the recent **[[increases in]{.mark} food
[prices]{.mark}]{.underline}** have **[significantly raised the number
of people suffering from hunger and living in poverty]{.underline}**
both in urban and rural areas **[irrespective of the poverty line
used]{.underline}** (de Hoyos and Medvedev, 2009; Dessus, Herrera and
Hoyos, 2008; Ivanic and Martin, 2008). The World Bank estimates that
**[the food crisis [pushed]{.mark}]{.underline}** 130 million to **[[155
million]{.underline}]{.mark}** people **[[into poverty]{.mark} in
2008]{.underline}**, while the poverty challenges posed by higher food
prices have returned (World Bank, 2010c). Food prices in lowincome
countries continue to rise; by the end of May 2009, food prices in these
countries rose 8 per cent faster than non-food prices, when compared
with January 2003 (see figure IV.1). Thus, the World Bank (2010d, p. 36)
concluded that the poor in low-income countries "may not be benefiting
from lower international food prices ... and ... a significant portion
of the 130 million \[that were\] pushed into extreme poverty during the
food-price spike ... may not have exited poverty as might have been
expected given the fall in international food prices".

**[A study of nine low-income countries]{.underline}** also **[revealed
that in the [short term higher]{.mark} food [prices increased]{.mark}
national poverty [rates by 4.5]{.mark} percentage
[points]{.mark}]{.underline}** even though these effects differed
substantially across countries and by commodity (Ivanic and Martin,
2008). The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean
estimated that **[the food price crisis added 10 million people each to
the ranks of the extremely poor and the moderately poor]{.underline}**.
**[Another study of 19 Latin American countries found that poverty had
increased by 4.3 percentage points, or by 21 million additional poor
people]{.underline}** (Robles and others, 2008).

**[In Asia, a 20 per cent increase in food prices probably increased the
number of poor by 5.7 million and 14.7 million in the Philippines and
Pakistan, respectively]{.underline}** (Asian Development Bank, 2008).
Revenga, Wodon and Zaman (2008) found that **[in Africa the share of the
population in poverty could have jumped by as much as 4.4 percentage
points]{.underline}** with an increase in the price of cereals by 50 per
cent. This negative welfare effect, caused by a decline in purchasing
power, particularly among urban consumers, was further exacerbated by
reductions in average household incomes as a result of the global
financial and economic crisis. Tiwari and Zaman (2010) also estimated
that the slowdown in the global economy may have led to an increase of
41.3 million in the number of undernourished people in 2009, that is 4.4
per cent more people than would have been the case if the global
economic crisis had not occurred. This is in addition to the estimated
923 million undernourished people in 2007 as estimated by FAO.

**[Higher food prices]{.underline}** have **[forced households to spend
more on food]{.underline}**. **[In Mexico, the food price shock caused
the average poor household to effectively lose 18 per cent of its food
budget]{.underline}** (Wood, Nelson and Nogueira, 2009). The result was
that **[households with limited or no substitution options have been
pushed below their normal caloric]{.underline}** or micronutrient
**[intake]{.underline}**, a situation **[[that threatens]{.mark} their
[long-term health and ability to escape poverty]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
A survey of food consumption patterns in the Central African Republic,
Ethiopia, Liberia and Sierra Leone found substantial evidence of
restricted dietary diversity and reductions, of both the size of food
portions and the frequency of meals, among poor households which are
increasing the risk of micronutrient deficiencies among children as well
as adults (Swan, Hadley and Cichon, 2010). **[Even where households have
been able to maintain their levels of daily caloric intake, by
substituting more expensive foods with cheaper alternatives, this
practice is causing micronutrient deficiencies where the substitutes are
less nutritious]{.underline}**.

**[The global food price crisis]{.underline}** has also **[induced
reduced household spending on health care and children's
education]{.underline}**. In the capital and largest city in Sierra
Leone, Freetown, children have been withdrawn from school and forced
into the labour market to contribute to family welfare (Swan, Hadley and
Cichon, 2010). Similar coping mechanisms have been adopted in other
parts of the developing world as well.

Although much global attention has been focused on the impact of the
food and the energy crises on developing countries, **[these impacts
also hit more developed countries]{.underline}** (van der Ploeg, 2010).
**[While starvation seldom occurs in industrialized economies, declines
in food expenditures by middle- and lowincome households have forced
families to eat less frequently and to consume less diverse and
nutrient-rich foods]{.underline}** (Nord, 2009). Several developed
countries saw spikes in chronic mild undernutrition among the poor and
other social groups, primarily due to job losses due to the global
financial and economic crisis. People who are out of work, have
exhausted their savings, or are nearing the end of their unemployment
benefits increasingly find themselves having to rely on local food banks
and other not-for-profit charitable organizations. For many of the "new
poor", this is the first time they have had to rely on public assistance
programmes for food and other benefits. In the United States, the number
of people living in food-insecure households jumped from 36.2 million in
2007 to 49.1 million in 2008 (Nord, 2009).

to argue that the dollar has suffered a slow but steady collapse. And
many **[financial experts claim [this is only the
beginning]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In an era when central banks are
printing money to infinity and racking up debts like never before,
something has to give. For those in the know, the question isn't if the
dollar will collapse... but rather, when. **[[As the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [plays a less]{.mark} and less [significant role in the
world]{.mark} economy]{.underline}** and countries like Russia and
**[[China threaten to replace the dollar as the global reserve
currency]{.underline}]{.mark}**, here are five of the most chilling
predictions about the future of the dollar. 5. Harvard economist starts
a "bank run" over dollar collapse fears Classical economist and Harvard
professor Terry Burnham told the world that he was withdrawing \$1
million from his Bank of America checking account because of the
negative consequences Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen have had on the US
dollar, and is trying to start a bank run by getting others to do the
same. He claimed a dollar collapse is also underway because the Fed's
manipulations had two adverse effects on the currency: decreasing
overall wealth by distorting markets, and redistributing wealth from
unsophisticated investors to the political elite through the currency.
Burnham said he couldn't stand getting paid zero interest by Bank of
America anymore, and didn't trust them to keep his money safe. At zero
interest, he was losing tens of thousands of dollars in purchasing power
every year due to inflation, while his well-connected bank benefitted.
4. **[[The]{.underline}]{.mark}** US **[[dollar collapse will be worse
than]{.mark} the situation in Spain or [Greece]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Billionaire Donald Trump says the dollar is on the edge of economic
ruin, and an economic collapse is the only remedy. He painted an ugly
picture of the US economy during an appearance on Fox News. In fact, he
issued a warning to Americans to prepare for "financial ruin". Trump
claims the United States is no longer a rich country because rich
countries don't borrow money. In the interview, Trump claimed that the
US is becoming a third world nation forced to borrow money and issue
debt. Trump also suggested an answer to the question "When will the us
dollar collapse?", saying that when US debt hits the \$21 to \$22
trillion mark, things will get much, much worse. 3. Even the US
government will stop using the dollar Jeff Berwick, editor of The Dollar
Vigilante, predicts that things will get so bad that even the
**[[American government will view]{.mark} [their]{.mark} own [dollar as
toxic waste]{.mark}]{.underline}**. He says the average American is in
"la la land" obsessing over TV shows or the next Presidential race. He
says what just happened in Ukraine could easily happen in the United
States. And while Ukraine saw their currency crisis coming for some
time, the US dollar collapse could happen overnight, he says. Berwick
says the US is "turning a corner" and headed for total financial ruin as
early as "this year", and quotes Jim Rogers who says "there is no paper
money in 2014 and 2015 that's going to be worth much of anything."
Berwick often predicts the "end of the monetary system as we know it"
and claims that, once all of the capital controls have been implemented
and the US government starts confiscating assets to pay creditors like
China, it will not even accept the tainted US dollar. 2.
**[[Fed]{.mark}eral Reserve [insolvency will cause a 90% drop in the
dollar]{.mark}]{.underline}** Financial expert and author of Currency
Wars Jim Rickards believes the "international monetary system is headed
for a collapse." Rickards sets the record straight on what an "economic
collapse" is, saying it doesn't mean we all go live in caves. In fact,
he says, we've seen three economic collapses in the last one hundred
years. In his new book, Rickards suggests the dollar will see the worst
of the next economic collapse as part of the "death of money", lamenting
that "we are on a global dollar standard". **[[He says a fiat
currency]{.mark} standard [can work]{.mark}, but [only if countries
inject confidence]{.mark} into the system [and welcome business]{.mark}
with open arms.]{.underline}** Of course, neither of those factors exist
in the United States. Among Rickards' chief reasons for predicting a
dollar collapse: quantative easing, a "lousy business environment", high
taxes, and low growth. He says that dollar-euro swaps from the Fed will
make the next collapse much bigger than the last one. 1. Russia will ban
the US dollar **[[Russia]{.mark}n legislator Mikhail Degtyarev has
likened the US dollar to a "[worldwide Ponzi
scheme](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/nov/13/bill-would-outlaw-us-dollar-russia/)"...
one he has claimed will end with the collapse of the
dollar]{.underline}** in 2017**[. He [submitted a bill to protect
Russians against the "collapsing US debt
pyramid"]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} saying growing rates of US
debt would cause a US dollar collapse if spending isn't remedied.
Degtyarev's bill would **[[ban US dollars from circulating]{.mark} in
Russia]{.underline}** and forbid private citizens from holding Russian
bank accounts in US dollars. Those with dollar-denominated accounts
would have to convert their accounts to other foreign currencies (his
bill would not ban the euro, pound, yen, or renmibi). However, Degtyarev
has proposed some wacky bills before, such as offering "menstruation
leave" for women in the workplace.

#### Economic decline causes protectionism and war -- their defense doesn't assume accompanying shifts in global power.

**Royal 10** -- Jedediah Royal, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction
at the U.S. Department of Defense, 2010, "Economic Integration, Economic
Signaling and the Problem of Economic Crises," in Economics of War and
Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectives, ed. Goldsmith and
Brauer, p. 213-215

Less intuitive is how periods of **[[economic decline may increase the
likelihood of external conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Political
science literature has contributed a moderate degree of attention to the
impact of economic decline and the security and defense behavior of
interdependent states. Research in this vein has been considered at
systemic, dyadic and national levels. Several notable contributions
follow. First, on the systemic level, Pollins (2008) advances Modelski
and Thompson's (1996) work on leadership cycle theory, finding
that **[rhythms in the global economy are associated with the rise and
fall of a pre-eminent power]{.underline}** and the often bloody
transition from one pre-eminent leader to the next. As such, exogenous
shocks such as **[economic crisis could usher in a [redistribution of
relative power]{.mark}]{.underline}** (see also Gilpin,
1981) **[that [leads to]{.mark} uncertainty about power balances,
increasing the risk of [miscalculation]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Fearon,
1995). Alternatively, even a relatively certain redistribution of power
could lead to a permissive environment for conflict as a rising power
may seek to challenge a declining power (Werner, 1999). Seperately,
Pollins (1996) also shows that global economic cycles combined with
parallel leadership cycles impact the likelihood of conflict among
major, medium and small powers, although he suggests that the causes and
connections between global economic conditions and security conditions
remain unknown. Second, on a dyadic level, Copeland's (1996, 2000)
**[theory of trade expectations suggests that '[future expectation of
trade' is a significant variable]{.mark} in understanding economic
conditions and security behavious of states. He argues that
interdependent [states are likely to gain]{.mark} pacific [benefits from
trade]{.mark} so long [as they have an optimistic view of future trade
relations]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark}
However, **[[if]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[expectations
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** future **[[trade
decline]{.underline}]{.mark}**, particularly for difficult to replace
items such as energy resources, **[the [likelihood for conflict
increases]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as states will be inclined to use
force to gain access to those resources. **[[Crisis
could]{.underline}]{.mark}** potentially **[be the [trigger]{.mark} for
[decreased trade expectations]{.mark}]{.underline}** either on its own
or because it triggers protectionist moves by interdependent
states. Third, [**others**]{.underline} have **[considered the link
between economic decline and external armed conflict at a national
level. [Blomberg and Hess]{.mark}]{.underline}** (2002) **[[find]{.mark}
a strong [correlation between internal conflict and external
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**, particularly
**[[during]{.underline}]{.mark}** periods of **[[economic
downturn]{.underline}]{.mark}**. They write, The linkages between
internal and external conflict and prosperity are strong and mutually
reinforcing. Economic conflict tends to spawn internal conflict, which
in turn returns the favor. Moreover, the presence of a recession tends
to amplify the extent to which international and external conflict
self-reinforce each other. (Blomberg & Hess, 2002. P. 89) Economic
decline has been linked with an increase in the likelihood of
terrorism (Blomberg, Hess, & Weerapana, 2004), which has the capacity to
spill across borders and lead to external tensions. Furthermore, crises
generally reduce the popularity of a sitting government.
'**[[Diversionary theory' suggests]{.underline}]{.mark}** that, [**when
facing unpopularity arising from economic decline, sitting [governments
have]{.mark} increase [incentives to fabricate]{.mark} external
[military conflicts]{.mark} to create a 'rally around the flag'
effect**.]{.underline} Wang (1996), DeRouen (1995), and Blomberg, Hess,
and Thacker (2006) find supporting evidence showing that economic
decline and use of force are at least indirectly correlated. Gelpi
(1997), Miller (1999), and Kisangani and Pickering (2009) suggest
that **[the tendency towards diversionary tactics are greater for
democratic states than autocratic states]{.underline}**, due to the fact
that democratic leaders are generally more susceptible to being
removed from office due to lack of domestic support. DeRouen (2000) has
provided evidence showing that periods of weak economic performance in
the United States, and thus weak Presidential popularity, are
statistically linked to an increase in the use of force. In
summary, recent economic scholarship positively correlated economic
integration with an increase in the frequency of economic crises,
whereas political science scholarship links economic decline with
external conflict at systemic, dyadic and national levels. This implied
connection between integration, crisis and armed conflict has not
featured prominently in the economic-security debate and deserves more
attention.

#### Dollar collapse leads to hyperinflation that decreases the value of the dollar by up to 100 trillion times -- that collapses the global economy

**Merritt \'14** ( Cam merritt is a reporter for Sapling, and investing
firm dedicated to reducing the impacts of debt on US society.
https://www.sapling.com/8257496/happens-debt-dollar-collapses)

**[[A collapse of the dollar]{.mark} would not be a good thing for the
U.S. economy, or the world\'s]{.underline}**, but there might be a bit
of a silver lining for people who owe money. Debt wouldn\'t be
eliminated by a dollar collapse, but repaying it would get easier.
That\'s because when a dollar loses nearly all its value, then \$100 or
\$1,000 or \$100,000 isn\'t worth much either. When economists talk
about a currency such as the dollar \"collapsing,\" they\'re referring
to a **[[sudden]{.mark}, steep [decline in the value of that currency,
to the point where it\'s worth only a tiny fraction of its previous
value]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For people using the currency, **[the
collapse manifests itself in [hyperinflation]{.mark} \-- extreme price
increases. Whereas today an apple might cost \$1, next week it might
cost \$10, and the week after that, \$20]{.underline}**. It\'s not that
the apple has gotten more valuable; it\'s that the dollar got less
valuable. Today, \$1 pays for a whole apple; next week, maybe a couple
bites\' worth. Currency collapses have produced astounding images of
people using stacks of money for the smallest purchases and of
governments printing banknotes in ridiculously high denominations,
**[[such as the 100-trillion-dollar bill]{.mark} that Zimbabwe printed
in the 2000s]{.underline}** (and which, according to \"The Wall Street
Journal,\" **[[still wouldn\'t even pay for local bus
fare]{.underline}]{.mark}**). During a currency collapse, hyperinflation
locks an economy into a \"wage-price spiral,\" in which higher prices
force employers to pay higher wages, which they pass on to customers as
higher prices, and the cycle continues. Meanwhile, the government cranks
out currency to meet demand, making inflation even worse. This spiral
can make it impossible for anyone to keep up with inflation, but it does
have one benefit for debtors \-- it makes it easier to pay off debt.
Imagine you had a mortgage with \$100,000 left on it, and your income
was \$50,000 a year. Now the dollar collapses, hyperinflation results
and the wage-price spiral pushes your income to, say, \$1 million a
year. (This represents roughly 2,000 percent inflation, relatively
modest as far as currency collapses go; in Zimbabwe, the annual
inflation rate in 2008 was 231 million percent.) But your mortgage is
still \$100,000, because hyperinflation doesn\'t change debt balances.
Before the collapse, it would have taken two years\' worth of wages to
pay off your mortgage; now it takes less than a month. In general,
inflation is good for debtors, since it reduces the real value of what
they owe, and bad for savers, since it reduces the real value of their
savings. The hyperinflation from a collapse of the dollar would
intensify these effects. If the dollar collapses and runaway inflation
results, it may get easier to pay off existing debt, but it\'s also
going to be extremely difficult, and costly, to engage in any new
borrowing. Inflation benefits borrowers at the expense of lenders. In
times of high inflation, lenders charge high interest rates to try to
stay ahead of the dwindling value of the money they\'ve lent out. Amid
hyperinflation, if they\'re willing to make loans at all, lenders would
be expected to set astronomical interest rates. And they might not be
willing in any case. **[[Amid hyperinflation, money can lose value so
fast that the only rational thing to do is to spend it]{.mark} \-- to
turn it into something of value \-- rather than lend it.]{.underline}**

Editor\'s note: [[Saudi Arabia has]{.underline}]{.mark} reportedly
[[threatened to sell its oil in currencies other than the US
dollar]{.underline}]{.mark} if Washington passes a bill that exposes
OPEC member states to US antitrust lawsuits. Columnist Niutanqin
comments in his WeChat post: [[Saudi Arabia\'s threat]{.mark} to delink
its oil trading from the US dollar, [if implemented, would be a severe
test for the United State\'s economy and the world\'s financial and
economic system]{.mark}.]{.underline} For economic reasons, the US has
long had close relations with Saudi Arabia, but it is also economic
factors this time that have driven a wedge between the two allies. The
No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act (NOPEC) the US administration
is pushing for is designed to remove the state immunity shield and to
allow OPEC and its national oil companies to be sued under US antitrust
law for anti-competitive attempts to limit the world\'s oil supply. The
bill, if passed, would have direct repercussions for Saudi Arabia, which
is the leading member of the oil organization. Despite the chances of
the US bill coming into force being slim, the fact [Riyadh is
considering such a drastic step is a sign of the kingdom\'s annoyance
about potential US legal challenges]{.underline} to OPEC. It is to some
extent out of the same concerns that Qatar, another important member of
oil cartel, announced its exit from the organization in December. [[If
Riyadh does bid farewell to the US dollar]{.mark} in its oil trade, [it
would undermine the dollar\'s status as the world\'s main reserve
currency, reduce Washington\'s clout in global trade and weaken its
ability to enforce sanctions on other countries]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[The US hegemony has long been built on the petrodollar]{.underline},
given that global oil production accounts for 2 to 3 percent of global
GDP and most oil transactions in the world, including derivatives, are
denominated in the US dollar. It is with the dollar hegemony that the US
has the means to impose sanctions on other countries even if they have
no direct links with it[. If the Saudi threat was to materialize, the
world\'s financial and economic order could be completely
rewritten,]{.underline} as [once Saudi Arabia carried out the threat,
other oil exporters who also suffer from the US bill will surely follow
suit, which will put an end to the petrodollar.]{.underline}

Threatens To Drop Dollar For Oil Trades.\"
https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Saudi-Arabia-Threatens-To-Drop-Dollar-For-Oil-Trades.html

[[Saudi Arabia has threatened the United States to stop using dollars
for its oil trades]{.underline}]{.mark} in an attempt to discourage
legislators from passing a bill dubbed NOPEC aimed at holding OPEC
liable for cartel practices under U.S. law. Reuters
[reports]{.underline}, citing unnamed sources, that the switch from U.S.
dollars to other currencies had been discussed in senior Saudi circles
and that it had also been shared with U.S. government officials from the
energy department. The reported threat takes OPEC's---Saudi
Arabia's---offensive against the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels
Act a step further after last month UAE oil minister, Suhail
al-Mazrouei, reportedly told lenders at the meeting that if the bill was
made into law that made OPEC members liable to U.S. anti-cartel
legislation, the group, which is to all intents and purposes indeed a
cartel, would break up and every member would boost production to its
maximum. [[This would]{.mark} be a repeat of what happened in 2013 and
2014, and [ultimately led to another oil price crash]{.mark} like the
one that saw Brent crude and WTI sink below US\$30 a
barrel.]{.underline} As a result, a lot of U.S. shale-focused,
debt-dependent producers would go under. Now, one of the Reuters sources
said, "The Saudis say: let the Americans pass NOPEC and it would be the
U.S. economy that would fall apart." Another source commented "The
Saudis know they have the dollar as the nuclear option." [[Other
countries are already using other currencies in oil
trades]{.underline}]{.mark}, notably Russia and Iran, but also China,
for some of its trades. China even launched a yuan-denominated oil
contract last year, which initially sparked concern. Later, this
subsided as the hype died out and the contract failed to remove
dollar-denominated European, Middle Eastern, and U.S. contracts from the
market. Still, [[if]{.mark} an oil seller as big as [Saudi Arabia were
to drop the dollar]{.mark} as its default trade currency, [this would
have strong reverberations for the greenback's status as the world's
dominant currency]{.mark}]{.underline} and it might also spur similar
moves by other oil exporters who are likely to feel threatened by the
NOPEC bill.

When the crash occurs, these parties will demand assets denominated in

[The petrodollar helped lift the U.S. Dollar to the world's leading
currency.]{.underline} Every country that wishes to import crude oil
needs the U.S. Dollars to purchase the commodity. This means that
foreign countries have to hold large amounts of U.S dollars. However,
they have been recent challenges to the Petrodollar system. With the
decline in purchasing power of the U.S. Dollar, China, [[in March
2018](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/China-Yuan-Futures-Launch-With-A-Bang.html?source=post_page---------------------------),]{.underline}
launched Yuan-denominated crude oil futures denominated in CNY
(Petro-Yuan) for oil marketing for the Far East. As the world's biggest
importer of crude oil, Beijing has long felt that pricing all its
millions of barrels of imports should be priced in Yuan. As the world's
largest importer of crude oil, China saw it as a reasonable change to
price the world's most vital commodity. Modern economies are built
mostly on faith. People have confidence in the U.S. Dollar because the
U.S. economy is the biggest and most significant economy in the world.
Also, the U.S. economy frequently outperforms the economies of Europe
and Japan. The US dollar is backed up by the output of American workers.
[[When people do lose faith in the U.S Dollar]{.mark}, its value will

Trillion](http://www.usdebtclock.org/?source=post_page---------------------------).
The point I'm making is that this charade cannot continue much longer.
China, the European Union, India, Brazil, Russia, and other major
economies are very aware of this coming crisis. It's hard to imagine the
U.S Dollar being replaced by another currency as the world's economic
standard, but it could very well happen. It is possible to wake up one
morning and see the U.S dollar slide into a death spiral, stocks in a
free fall, and hyperinflation. [[If the U.S. Dollar and the economy
collapses, the result will be the most significant stock market crash
ever]{.mark} in the New York Stock Exchange, probably 1000--2000 points
in the first day]{.underline}. Thus, the major stock exchange in London,
Frankfurt, Tokyo, and Hong Kong will have to suspend trading. Of course,
this suspension will significantly increase the panic among the general
population. [[Once people all over the world realize that they are a
significant stock market crash happening, there will be a run on banks
similar to the 1930s]{.underline}]{.mark}. In response, major financial
institutions will put a freeze on most or all banking transactions,
including credit card transactions. This will significantly increase
panic. Due to the bank freeze, employers will be unable to make bank
transactions to pay their employees. With employers unable to access
frozen bank accounts, people won't be paid, bills won't get paid, etc.
Consequently, [[most businesses will be forced to either go out of
business or significantly reduce their workforce]{.mark}; unemployment
will become rampant. With millions out of a job, [the number of
unemployment claims will skyrocket, bankrupting unemployment insurance
programs in the major countries.]{.mark}]{.underline}

What Would Happen in an Economic Collapse

[If the [economy collapses]{.mark}]{.underline}, you would lose access
to credit. Banks would close. [[Demand would outstrip]{.underline}
supply [of food, gas]{.underline}]{.mark}[, [and]{.mark}]{.underline}
other [[necessities]{.underline}]{.mark}. If the collapse affected local
governments and utilities, then water and electricity would no longer be
available. As people panic, they would revert to survival and
self-defense modes. The economy would return to a traditional economy,
where those who grow food barter for other services.

A U.S. economic collapse would create global panic. Demand for the
dollar and U.S. Treasurys would plummet. Interest rates would skyrocket.
Investors would rush to other currencies, such as the yuan, euro, or
even gold. It would create not just inflation, but hyperinflation, as
the dollar became dirt cheap.

How Close Are We to a Total Economic Collapse?

Any of the following seven scenarios could create an economic collapse.

[If the]{.underline} [U.S. dollar [rapidly loses
val]{.underline}]{.mark}[ue]{.underline}, it would create
hyperinflation.

A bank run could force [[banks]{.underline}]{.mark} to
[[close]{.mark}]{.underline} or even [go out of business]{.underline},
cutting off lending and even cash withdrawals.

[The [internet could become paralyzed ]{.mark}]{.underline}[with]{.mark}
a super-virus, preventing emails and online transactions.

[[Terrorist attacks]{.mark}]{.underline} or a massive oil embargo could
halt interstate trucking. Grocery stores would soon run out of food.

[[Widespread violence erupts across the nation]{.underline}]{.mark}.
That could range from inner-city riots[, a civil war, or a foreign

**Lulko 18** ( July 27 Lyuba Lulko"Three conditions to force the US
dollar system to collapse"
http://www.pravdareport.com/business/141298-us_dollar/)

There is a reverse side to it too. The debt-to-GDP ratio currently
stands at over one hundred percent, and calculations show that it will
grow. This factor will undermine confidence in the dollar.

Secondly, one needs to have a viable monetary alternative for buyers and
investors. [[If we get rid of the dollar]{.mark}, what are we going to
buy instead? [How are we going to trade]{.mark}]{.underline}? One may
suggest the yuan and the euro, but the yuan is a regulated currency, and
the euro is a regional one. It does not look like China wants to switch
from commodities to capital trade to make the yuan a convertible and
strong currency.

Thirdly, [someone needs to push the dollar to make it
collapse]{.underline}. Debt holder nations could, as it seems,
[[massively dispose of US bonds]{.mark}.]{.underline} [It\'s only [about
five trillion dollars]{.mark}]{.underline}: if China and Japan started
disposing their treasury stock on the secondary market, this would cause
great panic. Yet, the yuan fluctuates within a corridor. China
artificially lowers its rate to quietly enter the US market. In
addition, US bonds bring China a stable income in dollars, which the
country needs to meet importers\' demand.

Japan is now trying to exit the 15-year deflation cycle after the 2011
earthquake and Fukushima nuclear disaster. If the dollar becomes weak,
then the goods valued in yuan and yen will cost relatively more in the
United States. They will become less competitive.

The countries that lend to the US may start selling US bonds either for
political reasons or if they see their stocks dropping in price too
quickly and they have another export market to replace the American one.

Thus, the collapse of the dollar, and therefore of the American system
of living in debt is unlikely to happen. [If it happens]{.mark}, [[the
world will experience]{.mark} a [global]{.mark} economic
[shock]{.mark}]{.underline}. Gold, the euro, energy carriers and other
goods will become more expensive. [The [debt service will grow,]{.mark}
US import [prices will rise sharply]{.mark}, [hyperinflation]{.mark}
will follow,]{.underline} and exports will not yield any revenue.
I[nflation, [high interest rates]{.mark} and [volatility will
suppress]{.mark} the [growth]{.mark} of the real secto]{.underline}r.
[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, perhaps, [will launch military
redivision of the world,]{.mark} since every war brings profit and
economic recovery.]{.underline}

#### The US would cause there to be military backlash

As the [[U.S. dollar]{.underline}]{.mark} continues to [lose its
status]{.underline} as the world's premiere reserve currency, the
reality of [a world war seems inevitable,]{.underline} especially when
[major countries such as China, Russia and Iran are making strategic
moves to bypass the U.S. dollar]{.underline} in favor of other
currencies such as China's 'Petro-Yuan'. China has made the decision to
price oil in their own currency the "Yuan" by a new gold-backed futures
contract which will change the dynamics of the world's economy. [China
is preparing to launch the petro-Yuan later]{.underline} this year that
will eventually threaten the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve
currency.

At the end of World War II, the international economic system was in
shambles, so a plan was devised to create a new economic system. By July
1944, more than 730 delegates arrived at the United Nations Monetary and
Financial Conference in Bretton Woods, New Hamphire and signed on to the
historic Bretton Woods agreements which was a plan to set up a system of
rules, regulations that eventually led to the creation of the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF's main purpose was to prevent
any temporary imbalances of payments. The framework of the Bretton Woods
agreements was to control the value of money between various countries.
Each country had to have an established monetary policy that kept the
exchange rate of its own currency within a fixed value in terms of gold.
By 1971, the U.S. terminated the convertibility of the U.S. dollar to
gold (at the time, the fixed rate of gold was at \$35 an ounce) ending
the Bretton Woods system allowing the U.S. dollar to become a fiat
currency which has allowed central banks (especially the Federal Reserve
bank) to "print money out of thin air."

[China's move will have consequences]{.underline}. For starters, it will
certainly [[undermine Washington's ability to impose economic
sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark} on any nation at will and at the same
time, will [slowly [diminish the purchasing power for U.S.
consumers]{.mark}]{.underline} as imports become more expensive.

China (the largest holder of U.S. debt) is the largest importer of oil,
while Russia, one of the largest exporters of oil in the world have
agreed to use the petro-Yuan to bypass the petro-dollar. [The petro-Yuan
[threatens]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} dollar's
[[hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark} around the globe as several nations have
recently demonstrated as they all share an interest in joining the
transition from the U.S. dollar to the Yuan for oil transactions
including Washington's arch enemies Iran, Venezuela and even Indonesia
(currently not on Washington's hit list).

The mainstream-media has been reporting on the latest developments
concerning China's plan to bypass the dollar and introduce the
petro-Yuan to the international community in an article by CNBC titled
'China has grand ambitions to dethrone the dollar. It may make a
powerful move this year':

China is looking to make a major move against the dollar's global
dominance, and it may come as early as this year. The new strategy is to
enlist the energy markets' help: Beijing may introduce a new way to
price oil in coming months --- but unlike the contracts based on the
U.S. dollar that currently dominate global markets, this benchmark would
use China's own currency. If there's widespread adoption, as the Chinese
hope, then that will mark a step toward challenging the greenback's
status as the world's most powerful currency.

China is the world's top oil importer, and so Beijing sees it as only
logical that its own currency should price the global economy's most
important commodity. But beyond that, moving away from the dollar is a
strategic priority for countries like China and Russia. Both aim to
ultimately reduce their dependency on the greenback, limiting their
exposure to U.S. currency risk and the politics of American sanctions
regimes

Washington is on a collision course for another war with North Korea
with U.S. President Donald Trump leading the charge. With the power of
the U.S. dollar on life support, the [U.S. empire of debt continues to
use the [threat of war and in some cases, wage actual
wars]{.mark}]{.underline} around the world namely Iran, Syria and
Venezuela which have been on Washington's hit list for some time. Iran
and Russia are already slowly transitioning away from the U.S. dollar to
avoid any future economic sanctions imposed by Washington. Venezuela is
also ready and willing to make its move against the U.S. dollar. Reuters
did report on the decision made by the Maduro government to implement a
new system of international payments for its oil exports. The report
headlined with 'Venezuela's Maduro says will shun U.S. dollar in favor
of yuan, others' quoted what Maduro had said during a session of the
National Constituent Assembly at Palacio Federal Legislativo in Caracas,
Venezuela:

"Venezuela is going to implement a new system of international payments
and will create a basket of currencies to free us from the dollar,"
Maduro said in an hours-long address to a new legislative superbody,
without providing details of the new mechanism. "If they pursue us with
the dollar, we'll use the Russian ruble, the yuan, yen, the Indian
rupee, the euro," Maduro said

Another recent article published by CNBC 'China will 'compel' Saudi
Arabia to trade oil in Yuan --- and that's going to affect the US
dollar' interviewed Carl Weinberg a chief economist and a managing
director at High Frequency Economics about how the US dollar will lose
its global dominance in the near future once Saudi Arabia will be forced
to use the petro-Yuan since China is the world's top importer of oil:

Carl Weinberg, chief economist and managing director, said Beijing
stands to become the most dominant global player in oil demand since
China usurped the U.S. as the "biggest oil importer on the planet."

Saudi Arabia has "to pay attention to this because even as much as one
or two years from now, Chinese demand will dwarf U.S. demand," Weinberg
said. "I believe that yuan pricing of oil is coming and as soon as the
Saudis move to accept it --- as the Chinese will compel them to do ---
then the rest of the oil market will move along with them"

The [U.S. dollar]{.underline} is slowly [losing its' status as the
world's]{.underline} reserve currency, [so is a war with
China]{.underline} a possibility? Would the U.S. attack North Korea as a
stern warning to China or [would it bring [China into the conflict in an
attempt to save the U.S. dollar]{.mark}]{.underline}? Saddam Hussein
wanted to trade in Euro's instead of the U.S. dollar for Iraq's oil
exports and Libya's Muammar Gaddafi wanted the Gold Dinar to dethrone
the U.S. dollar in the continent of Africa. The decisions made by both
Iraq and Libya had consequences that led to their destruction by U.S.
and NATO forces. Can the U.S. do the same to China? I highly doubt it
since China has a formidable military that can defend itself against any
U.S. attack. China is certainly not Iraq nor Libya. So will there be a
war against China in the long term? With the [U.S.]{.underline} steadily
[collapsing]{.underline} at a slow pace[, [Washington would do anything
to survive]{.underline}]{.mark}. The U.S. dollar supports the
Military-Industrial Complex and its destructive and very expensive
adventures around the world.

### AT No Diversionary War

#### Robust statistical proof supports diversionary war. 

Patrick **HOWELL 13**. Graduate Student, International Affairs,
University of Georgia; BA, International Studies, Emory. "Economic
Crises and the Initiation of Militarized Disputes." Thesis.

**[The findings are clear: [economic crises are an important trigger
for]{.mark} shifts in a state's rate of [dispute
initiation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. By **[[using a large sample]{.mark}
of states [over]{.mark} a period of [185 years, this]{.mark}
conclusion]{.underline}** then **[[can]{.underline}]{.mark}** also
**[[be]{.mark} taken as [generalizable]{.mark} to the entire population
of states in the international system]{.underline}**. In addition to
providing support for issue crossover and the influence economic
troubles can play on foreign policy decisions, **[the findings here also
support the methodological rationale for using economic crises as
explicit, observable events, instead of as trends in other
variables]{.underline}** (e.g. GDP growth). Of course, this is not to
say that all work on this topic is final. There exist a number of areas
where this research agenda can be improved upon and/or extended to in
order to provide a more holistic account of where and how economic
crises exactly apply political pressure on leaders.

First, the study of **[[diversionary war exists in]{.mark} both
[quantitative tests and]{.mark} in more [fine-toothed examinations
of]{.mark} actual [cases]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Levy and Vakili 1992;
Fravel 2010). Exploring the internal processes within states in such a
fashion can also produce a deeper understanding of the exact causal
mechanisms through which prospect theory operates. Aggregation and
levels of analysis become a basic concern with applying prospect theory
outside of the laboratory and to states and governments. After all,
"prospect theory is developed as a theory of individual decision making,
the question is whether it is applicable to collective decision making"
(Vis 2011, 337). Here a unitary actor assumption is made from the
outset, but it is also possible that **[the observed effect is
driven]{.underline}** instead **[by individual decision-makers
themselves]{.underline}** (for example, Fuhrmann and Early 2008, who
keep the level of analysis only on President Bush). A deeper case study
of a few select cases with an eye towards process might reveal whether
the increase in conflict initiation is due to a single policy
entrepreneur or leader, or if it is the result of collective behavior
(as perhaps even aides, legislators, and bureaucrats seek to compensate
for the detrimental effects that accompany an economic crisis separately
or in concert).

Examination of specific cases might also provide a more accurate picture
for policymakers of the strategy that can accompany an economic crisis
and inducement of diversionary tendencies in another state.
**[Smith]{.underline}** (Smith 1998) **[hypothesizes]{.underline}**
diversionary actions as a strategic game, and finds that potential
target states should then adopt a policy of **[strategic
avoidance]{.underline}** -- disengaging from any scenario that might
make them a target from a diversionary conflict initiated by an opposing
state in dire straits. This question of strategic avoidance occurs most
often **[in the study of the]{.underline}** [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates (Fordham 2005; Meernik 2005), with evidence that
other states avoid and/or initiate fewer disputes with the United States
when the American economy is performing poorly. The empirical test here
using a proportionbased dependent variable might already be capturing
some degree of a strategic avoidance effect, in that some of the
variation in the proportion of initiation could be because the rate of
other states initiating disputes on the crisis-stricken state is
decreasing. **[If strategic avoidance is occurring, it actually
increases the strength of aspects of the diversionary war
literature]{.underline}** (**[in that other [states are]{.mark} actually
[behaving according to expectations]{.mark} of diversionary
actions]{.underline}**), but much more work and nuance would be needed
to separate where then the logic in strategic avoiders is originating.

**[The final implication of the findings to be discussed here is the
role of institutions]{.underline}** in this analysis. As stated above,
the **[[institutional controls]{.mark} that were included in the
estimation [demonstrated null effects]{.mark} on the overall rate of
militarized dispute initiation.]{.underline}** This finding is
interesting considering the enshrined role that institutions and regime
types tend to play within scholarly work on diversionary war. Similar to
the mixed results of GDP indicators, mixed and contradictory results can
be found throughout the body of work on diversionary war: **[some find
that the diversionary effects exist]{.underline}** mainly **[in
democratic settings]{.underline}** (Gelpi 1997; Davies 2002; Brul´e and
Williams 2009), **[while others find that diversionary effects occur in
autocratic settings]{.underline}** (Miller 1999; Lai and Slater 2005;
Pickering and Kisangani 2010).

**[One method of reconciling the conflicting conclusions of whether
democratic or autocratic leaders are more likely to engage in
diversionary behavior is]{.underline}** **[in direct tests
comparing]{.underline}** **[the two regime types]{.underline}**.
Typically, these comparisons have either found the two regime types
differ in the targets that are selected by each (Bueno De Mesquita and
Siverson 1995), or have found some fault with the way that the regime
types themselves are defined, due to differing incentives for differing
subtypes of regimes (Pickering and Kisangani 2005). In order to examine
the difference between democracies and autocracies, I split the sample
from Model 2 into either of the regime types, using a score of 6 in the
Polity2 measure as a cut-point. **[Splitting the sample has the effect
of interacting regime type with all independent variables, giving regime
specific effects not only for economic crises, but also all control
variables]{.underline}**.1

The results of this regime split can be found in Table 2. As can be seen
here, **[[the effect]{.mark} of economic crises
[is]{.mark}]{.underline}** positive and **[[significant in]{.mark} both
institutional settings]{.underline}**. Comparing the coefficients for
economic crisis in Table 2 with those of the original Model 2, the
likely explanation for why the institutional variables in the original
model did not have an impact on crisis initiation is because **[[all
democracies and autocracies]{.mark} possess]{.underline}** relatively
**[similar incentives for increasing crisis initiation
following]{.underline}** **[economic crises]{.underline}**, **[so any
variation across institutions was only averaged out]{.underline}**.
However, the results presented in Table 2 also provide support for a
difference existing in the process of how diversionary conflict might
occur in either regime type, due to the differences in control variable
significance. This lends some credence to the separation of democracies
and autocracies for study of diversionary war, but provides no evidence
that the effect should only exist in one or the other. **[The similarity
in the main independent variable of economic crises,]{.underline}**
though, **[furthers the assertion that the effect of economic crises
increasing dispute initiation can be viewed as a general behavior of all
states in the international system.]{.underline}**

Conclusions

Altogether, **[there can be said to be [a robust, positive
relationship]{.mark} between the occurrence of economic crises and the
rate of dispute initiation by states]{.underline}**. **[This effect [is
especially strong]{.mark} and demonstrable [when time ordering]{.mark}
is preserved by examining how crises in the previous year affect states
in their current year]{.underline}**. These findings can also be said to
have a relatively high degree of substantive import as well. As Figure 1
showed, the occurrence of each subsequent economic crisis increases the
chances of a state initiating disputes by almost 3%. **[[The]{.mark}
nearly [20]{.mark} percentage [point increase]{.mark} in dispute
initiation across the range of the lagged economic crisis variable also
[represents a substantial impact]{.mark}, especially [considering the
rare]{.mark} event [nature of]{.mark} militarized [disputes]{.mark} to
begin with]{.underline}**.

This generalizable finding can have far-reaching impact to both the
study of diversionary war in academia, as well as directly for
policymakers. In academe settings, **[there is good evidence to support
the use of acute economic crises over those variables based on the
slowershifting trends of GDP or public opinion measurements. Economic
[crises act as an explicit trigger that]{.mark} can [mark a leader's
shift into a losses frame and engage in riskier behavior]{.mark}
consistent with both prospect theory and diversionary war
hypotheses]{.underline}**. Meanwhile, applying this observed effect to
the real world would seem to indicate that if a state goes through an
economic crisis, other states should have increased wariness in their
dealings with the crisis-stricken state and/or be more prepared for the
possibility of a new dispute emerging in the wake of such an event.

Conclusion

The finding here of most general significance is that US presidents that
are term limited, or lacking in political ambition, by law, by
tradition, or by their own political commitments, have not in general
been more likely to initiate militarized interstate disputes in the
years from 1816 to 2010. Instead, our results suggest that **[it is [US
presidents]{.mark} who could aspire to re-election who [are more likely
to initiate]{.mark} international [conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[This finding is consistent with expectations that [the]{.mark} US's
[unique position]{.mark} in the international system [makes]{.mark}
American [presidents well positioned to employ diversionary
tactics]{.mark} in the pursuit of winning reelection]{.underline}**.

To be clear, our analysis of the American case does not necessarily
create doubts about the internal validity of multi-country research.
Consistent with previous research, we find no evidence of a relationship
between the political ambition of its presidents and the likelihood that
the US will be a target in a MID. **[[Our
results]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, do **[[suggest a]{.mark}
specific [limit on the external validity of]{.mark} the findings from
[multi-country studies]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Even when we subset
the dataset]{.underline}** used by Zeigler et al. (2014) **[to include
only dyads where the US is the sending state, we find results
inconsistent with broader patterns]{.underline}**. **[[Given the greater
precision and coverage of our data]{.mark} relative to existing studies,
[and the theoretical reasons]{.mark} to expect that [the US is
different, we]{.mark} are confident that we have [identified a clear
exception]{.mark} to previous research]{.underline}**.

The spread of nuclear weapons poses at least six severe threats to
international peace and security including: nuclear war, nuclear
terrorism, global and regional instability, constrained US freedom of
action, weakened alliances, and further nuclear proliferation. Each of
these threats has received extensive treatment elsewhere and this review
is not intended to replicate or even necessarily to improve upon these
previous efforts. Rather the goals of this section are more modest: to
usefully bring together and recap the many reasons why [we should be
pessimistic about the [likely consequences of]{.mark} nuclear
[proliferation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Many of these threats will be
illuminated with a discussion of a case of much contemporary concern:
Iran's advanced nuclear program. Nuclear War **[The [greatest threat
posed by]{.mark} the [spread of nuclear weapons is nuclear war]{.mark}.
[The more]{.mark} states [in possession of nuclear weapons]{.mark}, the
[greater]{.mark} the [probability]{.mark} that somewhere, someday,
[there will be a catastrophic nuclear war]{.mark}.]{.underline}** To
date, nuclear weapons have only been used in warfare once. In 1945, the
United States used nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, bringing
World War II to a close. Many analysts point to the 65-plus-year
tradition of nuclear non-use as evidence that nuclear weapons are
unusable, but it would be naïve to think that nuclear weapons will never
be used again simply because they have not been used for some time.
After all, analysts in the 1990s argued that worldwide economic
downturns like the Great Depression were a thing of the past, only to be
surprised by the dot-com bubble bursting later in the decade and the
Great Recession of the late 2000s.48 This author, for one, would be
surprised if nuclear weapons are not used again sometime in his
lifetime. **[Before reaching a state of MAD, new nuclear states go
through a [transition period]{.mark} in which they [lack a secure-second
strike capability]{.mark}. In this context, one or both [states]{.mark}
might [believe that it has an incentive to use nuclear weapons
first]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For example, if Iran acquires nuclear
weapons, neither Iran, nor its nuclear-armed rival, Israel, will have a
secure, second-strike capability. Even though it is believed to have a
large arsenal, **[given its small size and lack of strategic depth,
Israel might not be confident that it could absorb a nuclear strike and
respond with a devastating counterstrike. Similarly, [Iran]{.mark} might
eventually be [able to build a large]{.mark} and survivable [nuclear
arsenal]{.mark}, but, when it first crosses the nuclear threshold,
Tehran will have a small and vulnerable nuclear force.]{.underline}**
\]In these pre-MAD situations, there are at least three ways that
nuclear war could occur. First, **[[the state with the nuclear
advantage]{.mark} might [believe it has]{.mark} a splendid [first strike
capability]{.mark}. In a crisis, Israel might, therefore, decide to
launch a preventive nuclear strike to disarm Iran's nuclear
capabilities. Indeed, [this]{.mark} [incentive]{.mark} might be [further
increased by Israel's aggressive]{.mark} strategic culture that
emphasizes [preemptive action]{.mark}. Second, the state with a small
and vulnerable nuclear arsenal, in this case Iran, might feel use them
or lose them pressures. That is, in a crisis, Iran might decide to
strike first rather than risk having its entire nuclear arsenal
destroyed. Third, as Thomas Schelling has argued, nuclear war could
result due to the reciprocal fear of surprise attack.49 If there are
advantages to striking first, one state might start a nuclear war in the
belief that war is inevitable and that it would be better to go first
than to go second.]{.underline}** Fortunately, there is no historic
evidence of this dynamic occurring in a nuclear context, but it is still
possible. In an Israeli--Iranian crisis, for example, Israel and Iran
might both prefer to avoid a nuclear war, but decide to strike first
rather than suffer a devastating first attack from an opponent. Even in
a world of MAD, however, when both sides have secure, second-strike
capabilities, **[[there is still a risk of nuclear
war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Rational deterrence theory assumes
nuclear-armed states are governed by rational leaders who would not
intentionally launch a suicidal nuclear war. This assumption appears to
have applied to past and current nuclear powers, but there is no
guarantee that it will continue to hold in the future. **[Iran's
theocratic government,]{.underline}** despite its inflammatory rhetoric,
has followed a fairly pragmatic foreign policy since 1979, but it
contains leaders who hold millenarian religious worldviews and could one
day ascend to power. We cannot rule out the possibility that, as nuclear
weapons continue to spread, some leader somewhere will choose to launch
a nuclear war, knowing full well that it could result in
self-destruction. One does not need to resort to irrationality, however,
to imagine nuclear war under MAD. Nuclear weapons may deter leaders from
intentionally launching full-scale wars, but they do not mean the end of
international politics. As was discussed above**[, nuclear-armed states
still have conflicts of interest and leaders still seek to coerce
nuclear-armed adversaries.]{.underline}** Leaders might, therefore,
choose to launch a limited nuclear war.50 This strategy might be
especially attractive to states in a position of conventional
inferiority that might have an incentive to escalate a crisis quickly to
the nuclear level. During the Cold War, the United States planned to use
nuclear weapons first to stop a Soviet invasion of Western Europe given
NATO's conventional inferiority.51 As Russia's conventional power has
deteriorated since the end of the Cold War, Moscow has come to rely more
heavily on nuclear weapons in its military doctrine. Indeed, Russian
strategy calls for the use of nuclear weapons early in a conflict
(something that most Western strategists would consider to be
escalatory) as a way to de-escalate a crisis. Similarly, Pakistan's
military plans for nuclear use in the event of an invasion from
conventionally stronger India. And finally, Chinese generals openly talk
about the possibility of nuclear use against a US superpower in a
possible East Asia contingency. Second, as was also discussed above[,
**[leaders]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[can make a 'threat that leaves
something to chance'.52 They [can initiate a nuclear crisis]{.mark}. By
playing these [risky games]{.mark}]{.underline}** of nuclear
brinkmanship, **[states can [increase]{.mark} the [risk of nuclear
war]{.mark} in an attempt to force a less resolved adversary to back
down. Historical crises have not resulted in nuclear war, but many of
them,]{.underline}** including the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, **[have
come close.]{.underline}** And scholars have documented historical
incidents when accidents nearly led to war.53 **[When we think about
future nuclear crisis dyads, such]{.underline}** as Iran and Israel,
**[with fewer sources of stability than existed during the Cold War, we
can see that there is a real risk that a future crisis could result in a
devastating nuclear exchange. Nuclear Terrorism The [spread of nuclear
weapons also increases the risk of nuclear
terrorism]{.mark}.]{.underline}**54 While September 11th was one of the
greatest tragedies in American history, it would have been much worse
had Osama Bin Laden possessed nuclear weapons. [**Bin Laden declared it
a 'religious duty' for Al- Qa'eda to acquire nuclear weapons and radical
clerics have issued fatwas declaring it permissible to use nuclear
weapons in Jihad against the West.55 Unlike states, which can be more
easily deterred, there is little doubt that if terrorists acquired
nuclear weapons, they would use them.**56]{.underline} Indeed, in recent
years, many US politicians and security analysts have argued that
nuclear terrorism poses the greatest threat to US national security.57
**[Analysts have pointed out the tremendous hurdles that terrorists
would have to overcome in order to acquire nuclear weapons.58
Nevertheless, as nuclear weapons spread, the possibility that they will
eventually fall into terrorist hands increases. States could
intentionally transfer nuclear weapons, or the fissile material required
to build them, to terrorist groups. There are good reasons why a state
might be reluctant to transfer nuclear weapons to terrorists, but, as
nuclear weapons spread, the probability that a leader might someday
purposely arm a terrorist group increases.]{.underline}** Some fear, for
example, that Iran, with its close ties to Hamas and Hizballah, might be
at a heightened risk of transferring nuclear weapons to terrorists.
Moreover, even if no state would ever intentionally transfer nuclear
capabilities to terrorists, **[a new nuclear state, with underdeveloped
security procedures, might be vulnerable to theft, allowing terrorist
groups or corrupt or ideologically-motivated insiders to transfer
dangerous material to terrorists.]{.underline}** There is evidence, for
example, that representatives from Pakistan's atomic energy
establishment met with Al-Qa'eda members to discuss a possible nuclear
deal.59 **[Finally, a [nuclear-armed state could collapse]{.mark},
[result]{.mark}ing [in]{.mark} a [breakdown of law]{.mark} and order and
a loose nukes problem.]{.underline}** US officials are currently very
concerned about what would happen to Pakistan's nuclear weapons if the
government were to fall. As nuclear weapons spread, this problem is only
further amplified. Iran is a country with a history of revolutions and a
government with a tenuous hold on power. The regime change that
Washington has long dreamed about in Tehran could actually become a
nightmare if a nuclear-armed Iran suffered a breakdown in authority,
forcing us to worry about the fate of Iran's nuclear arsenal.
**[[Regional Instability]{.mark} The spread of nuclear weapons also
[embold]{.mark}ens [nuclear powers]{.mark}, contributing to regional
instability. States that lack nuclear weapons need to fear direct
military attack from other states, but states with nuclear weapons can
be confident that they can deter an intentional military attack, giving
them an incentive to be more aggressive in the conduct of their foreign
policy. In this way, nuclear weapons provide a shield under which states
can feel free to engage in lower-level aggression.]{.underline}**
Indeed, international relations theories about the
'stability-instability paradox' maintain that stability at the nuclear
level contributes to conventional instability.60
**[Historically,]{.underline}** we have seen that **[the spread of
nuclear weapons has emboldened their possessors and contributed to
regional instability. Recent scholarly analyses have demonstrated that,
after controlling for other relevant factors, nuclear-weapon states are
more likely to engage in conflict than nonnuclear-weapon states and that
this aggressiveness is more pronounced in new nuclear states that have
less experience with nuclear diplomacy.]{.underline}**61 Similarly,
research on internal decision-making in Pakistan reveals that Pakistani
foreign policymakers may have been emboldened by the acquisition of
nuclear weapons, which encouraged them to initiate militarized disputes
against India.62 Currently, Iran restrains its foreign policy because it
fears major military retaliation from the United States or Israel, but
with nuclear weapons it could feel free to push harder. **[A
[nuclear-armed Iran would]{.mark} likely step up [support]{.mark} to
[terrorist and proxy groups and engage in]{.mark} more
[aggressive]{.mark} coercive [diplomacy]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[With
a nuclear-armed Iran increasingly throwing its weight around in the
region, we could witness an even more crisis prone Middle East. And [in
a]{.mark} poly-[nuclear Middle East]{.mark}]{.underline}** with Israel,
Iran, and, in the future, possibly other states, armed with nuclear
weapons, **[any one of those [crises could result in a catastrophic
nuclear exchange]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### Global proliferation causes a repeat of the Cold War

**Blade 3/23** (The editorial board - The Blade. 23 March 2019.

New START, the 2010 agreement made by President Barack Obama and Russian
President Dmitry Medvedev that limits the number of strategic nuclear
warheads and missile launchers, is also expected to be scrapped.
[[With]{.mark} the [restraints coming off]{.mark}, both
[countries]{.mark} have [show]{.mark}n an [eagerness to grow]{.mark}
their [nuclear arsenals]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The
[U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline}, in particular, [has c[ommitted]{.mark} to a
10-year plan [to]{.mark} modernize and [expand its nuclear weapons
systems]{.mark} at a cost of \$494 billion]{.underline}.
[[Russia]{.mark} [is]{.mark} likely [not far
behind]{.mark}.]{.underline} As Mr. Putin chillingly said following the
recent suspension of the INF, "If \[the U.S. starts\] working on new
weapons, so will we." [This [shift in nuc]{.mark}lear [strategy]{.mark}
could [signal major changes]{.mark} around the world. [If the policy of
nonproliferation]{.mark} promoted by the United States and Russia in the
1980s [continues to fade]{.mark}, [countries]{.mark} like Iran
[are]{.mark} more [likely to seek out nuclear arms]{.mark} while
countries like Pakistan, India, and North Korea will hope to expand
their arsenals.]{.underline} Meanwhile, the [[war]{.underline}]{.mark}
of words [[between]{.mark} Mr. [Trump and]{.mark} Mr.
[Putin]{.mark}]{.underline}, who have used ominous phrasing like "no
choice" and "symmetrical response" to describe their nuclear policies,
[[has]{.mark} the [dangerous potential to]{.mark} [boil over]{.mark}
[into something much more grave]{.mark}. [During the first Cold
War]{.mark}, [people said that the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and
Russia were trending toward m]{.mark}utually [a]{.mark}ssured
[d]{.mark}estruction. [If the]{.mark} two [countries continue to walk
back all]{.mark} the [progress]{.mark} they have [made]{.mark} on
nuclear arms, [we are likely to find ourselves on that same]{.mark}
well-worn [path]{.mark}.]{.underline}

As if that were not scary enough, **[the [nuclear future of the Middle

Dreams, 9 March 2019, "We're Edging Closer to Nuclear War,"

**[It's easy to imagine]{.underline}** even more **[dangerous
faceoffs]{.underline}** elsewhere in the world. **[The mos[t terrifying
new nuclear powers]{.mark} would be [Iran and Saudi]{.mark}
Arabia]{.underline}**. Iran has enough scientific talent to develop a
bomb, and **[Saudi Arabia could buy what it needs]{.underline}**.
Hearing the leaders of those countries snarl at each other is scary
enough today. **[[If both had nuclear weapons]{.mark} --- not a
far-fetched scenario if present trends continue --- [war]{.mark} between
them [could be devastating]{.mark}]{.underline}**. So could a war over
Taiwan, if Taiwan were to build a nuclear arsenal to compete with
China's. Serbia and Kosovo are in bitter conflict over disputed
territory. So are Armenia and Azerbaijan.

Once while waiting for a flight at an airport in Ecuador, I stared at a
giant map of the country that was painted on the terminal wall. It
looked odd. Ecuador seemed much larger than I remembered. Finally, I
realized that on this map, its borders had been drawn to include
territory in the Amazon that Ecuador lost to Peru in the 19th century
and still claims. A banner over the map proclaimed: "Ecuador Was, Is and
Will Always Be an Amazon Nation." The dispute over this territory has
set off several wars between Peru and Ecuador. The last one, in 1995,
led to several hundred casualties. In a world where nuclear weapons are
widely spread, political passion could turn an obscure dispute like this
into global catastrophe.

That world is emerging. The Trump administration has been moving
systematically to undermine accords that have kept nuclear proliferation
within possibly manageable limits over the last half-century. Most
recently it announced that the United States will withdraw from the 1987
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia, which regulates
several classes of nuclear missiles. Steps like this produce little if
any military gain and damage the United States in the court of world
opinion.

**[Senior policymakers around]{.underline}** President **[[Trump
reject]{.underline}]{.mark}** the very idea of [**[arms
contro]{.underline}**l]{.mark}. They are resuming the wrecking rampage
launched by President George W. Bush, who pulled the United States out
of the Anti-Ballistic Missle treaty in 2001. That move left Russia and
China free to develop a new generation of hypersonic missiles. All steps
away from control of nuclear arms have effects like that. They also,
however, make a stark political point. **[By [renouncing arms
control]{.mark}, the United States declares its wish for a world without
treaties; if that [frees other countries to build nuclear
arsenals]{.mark}, so be it.]{.underline}**

**[[Giving up on arms control increases]{.mark} the [possibility that
governments]{.mark} with violently irredentist ambitions [could build or
acquire nuc]{.mark}lear weapons. That volatile mix --- a local conflict
plus nuclear weapons --- could one day [produce the explosion humanity
fears]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Last month's clash between India and
Pakistan was a warning. Cooler heads prevailed, but that won't happen
every time. By dismantling accords that limit nuclear weapons, we bring
the explosion steadily closer.

## Riots

### 1NC

#### There would be a freezing of all monetary transactions and leads to riots writ large

**Nwogu 19**\' ( March 28 Analyzing geopolitics, the global economy, and
the military affairs that impact our world.\"The Coming Collapse of the
U.S. Economic System --- Blame the U.S.
Dollar\"https://medium.com/@meziechinwogu1/the-coming-collapse-of-the-u-s-economic-system-blame-the-u-s-dollar-b4c4238741a4
What Would Happen in an Economic Collapse

Modern economies are built mostly on faith[. People have confidence in
the U.S. Dollar]{.underline} because the U.S. economy is the [biggest
and most significant economy in the world]{.underline}. Also, the U.S.
economy frequently outperforms the economies of Europe and Japan. The US
dollar is backed up by the output of American workers. When people do
lose faith in the U.S Dollar, its value will plunge, the stock market
will crash, and the U.S economy will collapse. The U.S. National Debt is
over \$22 Trillion. However, the total the US total debt (debt owed by
state & local governments, [Household, businesses, financial
institution, and the Federal Government) [is a staggering \$74
Trillion]{.mark}. The point I'm making is that this charade cannot
continue much longer. Chi]{.underline}na, the European Union, India,
Brazil, Russia, and other major economies are very aware of this coming
crisis. It's hard to imagine the U.S Dollar being replaced by another
currency as the world's economic standard, but it could very well
happen. [It is [possible to wake up one morning and see the U.S dollar
slide into a death]{.mark} spiral, stocks in a free fall, and
hyperinflation]{.underline}. If the U.S. Dollar and the economy
collapses, the result will be the most significant stock market crash
ever in the New York Stock Exchange, [[probably 1000--2000 points in the
first day]{.underline}]{.mark}. Thus, the major stock exchange in
[[London]{.mark}, Frankfurt, [Tokyo]{.mark}, [and Hong Kong will have to
suspend trading.]{.mark}]{.underline} Of course, this suspension will
significantly increase the panic among the general population. Once
people all over the world realize that they are a significant stock
market crash happening, there will be a run on banks similar to the
1930s. [In response, [major financial institutions will put a freeze on
most or all banking transactions]{.mark}, including credit card
transactions.]{.underline} This will significantly increase panic.

Due to the bank freeze, employers will be unable to make bank
transactions to pay their employees. With employers unable to access
[[frozen bank accounts, people won't be paid]{.mark}, bills won't get
paid, etc. [Consequently, most businesses will be forced to either go
out of business or significantly]{.mark} reduce their workforce;
unemployment will become rampant]{.underline}. With millions out of a
job, the number of unemployment claims will skyrocket, bankrupting
unemployment insurance programs in the major countries. When people
realize that the value of their hard earned wealth is about to
evaporate, they will take drastic measures to prevent it. Those who own
stores and businesses will increase their prices for goods and services
drastically to survive the crisis. Panic hoarding of food, medical
supplies, gasoline, heating oil, and other commodities will erupt[.
[Runaway inflation, gas lines,]{.mark} and r[ationing will
begin.]{.mark} Widespread violence will explode across America. That
could range [from inner-city riots or gang wars]{.mark}. The [breakdown
of law and order will be the ]{.mark}]{.underline}[ultimate effect of
rioting and looting,]{.mark} [as they lose all their sense of right and
wrong and are increasingly [empowered in their sense of anger, panic,
and greed.]{.mark}]{.underline} Major social upheaval will occur in
America, and the fear of the unknown will set in amongst the populace.
The U.S. will be hardest hit because it has the largest economy, an
enormous national debt, an economy based on credit, and a population
greatly divided by race, ethnic origin, gender, color, religious
beliefs, cultural differences, and financial status.

#### Riots kill millions and lead to coups, civil wars, and revolutions

**[[Civil unrest is a powerful form of collective human
dynamics,]{.mark} which has led to major transitions of societies in
modern history]{.underline}**. The study of collective human dynamics,
including **[[collective aggression]{.underline}]{.mark}**, has been the
focus of much discussion in the context of modeling and identification
of universal patterns of behavior. In contrast**[, [the possibility that
civil unrest activities, across countries and over long time
periods]{.mark}, are governed by universal mechanisms has not been
explored]{.underline}**. Here, records of civil unrest of 170 countries
during the period 1919--2008 are analyzed. It is demonstrated that the
distributions of the number of unrest events per year are robustly
reproduced by a nonlinear, spatially extended dynamical model, which
reflects the spread of **[[civil disorder]{.mark} between geographic
regions [connected through social and communication
networks.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The results also expose the similarity
between global social instability and the dynamics of natural hazards
and epidemics.

**[[Civil unrest contagion occurs when social, economic, and political
stress accumulate slowly]{.mark}, and is released spontaneously in the
form of social unrest on short time scales to nearest and long-range
neighboring regions that are susceptible to social, economic, and
political stress]{.underline}** \[1\]--\[5\]. Unrest events have led to
significant societal and cultural changes throughout history. Examples
include the spread of discontent in France in 1848 that proliferated to
most of Europe and parts of Latin America; the wave of urban racial
riots in the United States in the 1960s; and the 1989 uprisings against
communism in various central and eastern European countries, symbolized
by the fall of the Berlin Wall. More recently, social instability has
spread rapidly in the Arab world -- from nonviolent protest movements in
Tunisia and Egypt that toppled long-established authoritarian regimes,
to a protest movement that evolved to a full-blown civil war in Libya.
**[[These social unrest events span the full spectrum from civil wars,
revolutions, and coups d'état that have killed millions of people to
relatively peaceful forms]{.mark} of intra-state conflicts, such as
anti-government demonstrations, riots, and general
strikes]{.underline}** [\[5\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3485346/#pone.0048596-Scarman1)--\[10\].

2016,https://www.thomhartmann.com/forum/2012/04/wars-we-fight-%E2%80%93-god-save-petrodollar-coming-collapse-dollar)

The Collapse of the Dollar

[The]{.underline} pending [[collapse of the Dollar is being seen/felt
globally]{.underline}]{.mark}...in world economies[, financial markets
and in ever-expanding military actions]{.underline}. The Petrodollar
Titanic is sinking. There are simply too many holes to be plugged at
this point in order to keep the system afloat.

There are enormous amounts of excess dollars floating around globally
right now because of the Petrodollar system. As more countries (plan to)
move away from this system, the excess dollars will begin to find their
way back to the US economy. In other words, as the [dollar becomes less
significant, so will the need to hold dollars and reserves in the form
of U.S. Treasury Securities.]{.underline} U.S. government debt will
become increasingly more difficult to finance and inflation will show up
as the unneeded dollars begin to flood the U.S. economy.

[What will happen]{.underline}ed when (not [[if)]{.mark} [the dollar
collapses]{.mark}]{.underline}? If we don't get into an all out
international war before that happens, this is what we can expect at
home here in the USA:

• The dollar will lose it value • The weight of the [[US deficit will
come crashing down]{.underline}]{.mark} • Borrowing will become
prohibitively expensive. The free [financing made possible]{.underline}
by the Petrodollar system will be eliminated • Low cost oil imports made
possible by the Petrodollar system will no longer be possible •
[[Hyperinflation will occur]{.underline}]{.mark} very quickly • [People
will [not]{.mark} be [able to afford]{.mark} to buy [food]{.mark} to
eat, [gas]{.mark} for their cars, [energy]{.mark} to heat/cool their
[homes]{.mark},]{.underline} water, clothes to wear or any of the basic
necessities • Payments from social services such as social security,
disability, food stamps and pensions may be reduced, or perhaps even
eliminated [• [Production]{.mark} and transportation will be [severely
impacted]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Farm (food) production will
decrease, energy production will decrease, transportation (planes, cars,
buses, trains, trucking, etc) will be prohibitively expensive [•
[Widespread riot]{.mark}s [and]{.mark} civil [unrest]{.mark} will
occur]{.underline} • [[Marshall law will be enacted]{.underline}]{.mark}

This time is approaching rapidly. The preparations for the impending
collapse can clearly be seen with the restrictive legislation being
passed (quite swiftly at this point) that will be needed in order to
enforce order as the chaos begins to unfold.

What can we do as individuals to avert this disaster? Sadly, at this
point it will be difficult to avoid. It would be kind of like Enron
deciding in their final hour to start operating in an ethical and
economically feasible manner. Once the snowball is that large, it's hard
to stop. We can however, try and be prepared as best as possible.

#### It would cause riot in major places access the world

**Shield 11\'** ( Silver June 23 The Sons of Liberty Academy is the

formalized awakening process to help Americans deal with a post-dollar
world.\"Here Are The 5 Worst Places To Be When The Dollar Collapses\"
https://www.businessinsider.com/here-are-the-5-worst-places-to-be-when-the-dollar-collapses-2011-6))

So this leads me to the [Top 5 Places Not To Be When the Dollar
Collapses.]{.underline}

1\. I[srael]{.underline}- This Anglo-American beach head into the Middle
East was first conceived by the most powerful family in the world, the
Rothschilds, in 1917. The Balfour Declaration said that there will be a
Zionist Israel years before World War two and the eventual establishment
of Israel. Israel has not been a good neighbor to its Muslim nations and
has always had the two biggest bullies on the block at it\'s back. When
the dollar collapses, the [United States will have too much on its plate
both domestically and internationally to worry about such a
non-strategic piece of land]{.underline}. This will [[leave Israel very
weak at a time when tensions will be high]{.underline}]{.mark}. This
very thin strip of desert land will not be able to with stand the
economic reality of importing its food and fuel or the political reality
of being surrounded by Muslims.

2\. Southern California- The land of Fruits and Nuts turns into
Battlefield Los Angeles. [2[0 million people packed into an area that
has no water]{.underline}]{.mark} [and thus food is not good to say the
least.]{.underline} Throw on top of the huge wealth disparities and the
proximity to a narco state and this does not bode well. We have seen
riots for Rodney King, what will happen when the dollar is destroyed and
food an fuel stop coming into this area. People will get desperate and
do crazy things, especially when a huge proportion of its citizens are
on anti depressants. If food and fuel cannot get in, what about Zoloft?
At a time when [[people\'s world are falling apart they lack the ability
to deal]{.mark} with this new paradigm. If people come off of these
drugs too fast they [suffer psychotic breaks]{.mark} and you [will have
thousands of shootings or suicides.]{.mark}]{.underline}

3\. England- [The Land of the Big Brother and former Empire of world
wide slave and drug trade will suffer heavily]{.underline}. The stiff
upper lip that their the British Elite ingrained into their sheeple will
not work anymore as the British population explodes. The human character
will sacrifice and unite for a foreign enemy,but not if the enemy has
always been the Elite. The Anglo-American Empire may pull off another
[false flag](http://dont-tread-on.me/the-3-coming-false-flags/) to
distract it\'s population on another Emmanuel Goldstein like in 1984,
but I feel this collapse will happen before they pull it off. This will
make all eyes point at the British Elite as solely responsible for this
catastrophe. [[We]{.mark} [have seen massive riots]{.mark} for
soccer]{.underline} matches with hooligans. What will happen when this
island with very little food and fuel gets cut off?

4\. New York City- Another large urban area living too high on the
dollar hog. NYC is the area I moved out of in 2008. There is little
doubt that all of the wealth in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut is
derivative off of Wall Street wealth. The savings and investments of the
whole nation and much of the world flows through this financial capital.
As the world wakes up to the massive financial fraud, this will lead to
the destruction of capital like we have never seen before. This will
have tremendous effects on the regional economy as people driving in
Mercedes suddenly wonder where their next meal is coming from.

5\. Washington D.C.- The political collapse of the Federal Government
will wreck havoc on the hugely inflated local economy. As more and more
states find it necessary to assert their natural control, the Federal
Government will suddenly loose power and importance as the whole world
suffers from a Global Hurricane Katrina. The money that they create and
spend, will become worthless and the government minions pensions will
evaporate.

Millions that once relied on the ability to force others to send their
money to them,will learn that the real power has always been at the most
local level. Massive decentralization will be the answer to
globalization gone mad. [Local families and communities will forgo
sending money and power out of their community, as they will care about
their next meal and keeping warm]{.underline}.

### EX - SV Impact

#### Riots entrench massive structural violence

**Fielding 11**

Steven Fielding is an academic in the School of Politics at the
University of Nottingham where he is Professor of Political History and
Director of the Centre for British Politics. September 5,
2011/nottspolitics.org/2011/09/05/the-impact-of-the-riots-people-feel-more-threatened-and-prejudiced///dvb

Rather, following the riots people felt more threatened in
specifically two ways. First, people were more likely to feel that
their safety was threatened, i.e. they were more fearful of increasing
violence and vandalism in their neighbourhood. Second, they were more
likely to feel that wider British culture and society was under
threat, i.e. they were more fearful that British culture is threatened.
Feelings of security threat increased by 10% and feelings of cultural
threat increased by 5%. These were 'statistically significant' effects.
In short, citizens were more likely after the riots to feel that their
security and wider society was under threat.

This has had important consequences. **[[Although people did not
associate the riots with specific minority groups]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(whether Muslim/Black/East European communities), **[[they were more
prejudiced in their aftermath]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Those who felt
afterwards that their security was under greater threat were more likely
to express hostile attitudes toward Muslims. Meanwhile, those who felt
afterwards that wider British society and culture were under greater
threat were more likely to express hostility toward Muslims and also
Black and East European communities. So, whereas the riots were not
associated in the public mindset with particular minority groups, they
have nonetheless increased prejudice in British society.

Our findings suggest that the **[[riots have lead citizens to feel more
threatened]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which in turn has **[[intensified
intolerance toward minority groups]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This
indicates that beyond their immediate impact on property and criminal
convictions, the riots have had a broader impact **[[by undermining
social cohesion and entrenching negative
attitudes]{.underline}]{.mark}** toward minority groups (even though the
public did not associate the riots directly with these groups).

## Sanctions Programs

### 1NC

#### That decks U.S. sanctions and leads to rampant military campaigns

**Das 18 '** ( september 07, Satyajit Das is a former banker whose

[The [dollar's pivotal role]{.mark}]{.underline} --- an "exorbitant
privilege," in the term coined by then French Finance Minister Valéry
Giscard d\'Estaing in 1965 --- allows the [U[.S. easily to finance its
trade]{.mark}]{.underline} and budget deficits. The nation is protected
against balance-of-payments crises, because it imports and services
borrowing in its own currency. [American]{.underline} monetary
[policies]{.underline}, such as quantitative easing, [can influence the
value of the dollar]{.underline} to gain a competitive advantage. But
[the [real power of the dollar is its relationship with sanctions
programs]{.mark}]{.underline}. Legislation such as the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act, the Trading with the Enemy Act and the
Patriot Act allow Washington to weaponize payment flows. The proposed
Defending Elections From Threats by Establishing Redlines Act and the
Defending American Security From Kremlin Aggression Act would extend
that armory. When combined with access it gained to data from Swift, the
Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication's global
messaging system, [the U.S. exerts [unprecedented control over
global]{.mark} economic [activity]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Sanctions target persons, entities, organizations, a regime or an entire
country. Secondary curbs restrict foreign corporations, financial
institutions and individuals from doing business with sanctioned
entities. Any dollar payment flowing through a U.S. bank or the American
payments system provides the necessary nexus for the U.S. to prosecute
the offender or act against its American assets.

[This [gives the nation extraterritorial reach over non-Americans
trading]{.mark} with or financing a sanctioned
[party]{.mark}]{.underline}. The mere threat of prosecution can
destabilize finances, trade and currency markets, effectively disrupting
the activities of non-Americans.

Chartered Plc, Commerzbank AG and Clearstream Banking SA have paid large
fines for similar breaches.

Secondary sanctions made it difficult for United Co. Rusal to refinance
dollar borrowings when global businesses, banks and exchanges were
forced to stop dealing with the Russian company. [[Its bonds and shares
plunged, even though the company sells only 14 percent]{.mark} of its
products in the U.S.,]{.underline} does not use American banks, and is
listed in Moscow and Hong Kong. ZTE Corp., a Chinese electronics
company, was hit hard by the inability to buy essential components from
suppliers because of sanctions for ..

China, Russia and increasingly Europe want an alternative reserve
currency system. The problem is that immediate replacement of the dollar
is difficult. [First, [the euro]{.mark}, the [yen]{.mark}, the
[yuan]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the [ruble are not]{.mark}]{.underline}
realistic [[options]{.underline}]{.mark}. The euro's long-term future
and stability isn't assured, while Japan's economy remains trapped in
two decades of torpor. The Chinese and Russian political and economic
systems lack transparency, and the yuan isn't fully convertible.

Second, the required change in infrastructure is daunting.
Foreign-exchange markets where the dollar is the currency of reference
would have to be fundamentally restructured. [[Deep and liquid money
markets to support a reserve currency can't be conjured up
overnight]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Third, most candidates are reluctant to take on the role of a global
reserve currency because of tensions between national and global economy
policy. The economist Robert Triffin pointed out that the country whose
medium of exchange is the global reserve currency must meet external
demand for foreign exchange. [This [necessitates running large trade

Sanction\"

The Weaponized Dollar

[[Dollar-based sanctions are]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[[unique]{.underline}]{.mark} form of what Oona Hathaway and Scott
Shapiro call "[[outcasting]{.underline}]{.mark}"---a punishment that
consists of "denying the disobedient the [benefits of social
cooperation]{.underline} and membership."13 The potency of these
sanctions derives from the exclusion of [[targeted actors from the
dollar-based international financial]{.mark} system]{.underline} and the
denial of the benefits associated with participation in it. Outcasting
is generally cooperative---cooperation is often necessary to engender a
network of sufficient importance to make exclusion from it a costly
sanction. Dollar outcasting is not. The substantial network
externalities resulting from wide use of the dollar are organic and
arise mostly from "voluntary" choices (even if, in practice, market
dynamics leave little actual choice). There is no international
arrangement mandating the dollar\'s role. So long as commercial actors
and nations opt into the dollar-based financial system (or lack a
realistic alternative), the [[United States will be able to flex its
financial muscles unilaterally]{.underline}]{.mark}.14

The United States has two primary legal tools for dollar outcasting:
[[Section 311 of the]{.mark} Patriot Act]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
the [Specially Designed Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN)
List]{.underline}. Section 311 empowers the Treasury Department to
compel U.S. banks to deny services to any entity designated as a
"primary money laundering concern."15 In particular, Section 311(b)(5)
allows the Treasury Department to ban U.S. banks from providing
correspondent banking services to the designated entity, effectively
cutting off its access to dollar clearing and denying it meaningful
participation in the global financial system. [Without this access, a
[bank is unable to provide its foreign clients with the dollar payments
services they require]{.mark}.]{.underline} Critically, this [tool can
be brought to [bear against an entire jurisdiction (e.g.,
Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}) or a single bank ([e.g., [one serving
terrorist groups]{.mark}]{.underline}). It can function as a machete or
a scalpel. As Juan Zarate writes, such action is a "[virtual [financial
death penalty,]{.mark}]{.underline}["]{.mark} for the reasons discussed
earlier.16

Moreover, the Treasury Department often uses Section 311 to coerce
foreign financial institutions without even applying these measures
directly. Section 311 requires the Department to issue a notice of
proposed rulemaking (NPRM) before designating a primary money laundering
concern, effectively a formal threat that implies a high risk of
impending legal action. Doing so imposes reputational costs (and
possible subsequent regulatory scrutiny) on any bank that continues to
transact with the threatened entity and signals potential future
regulatory action against the entity that could bar it---and potentially
any of its counterparties---from the U.S. market.

The mere threat of Section 311 designation has been catastrophic for
targeted institutions.17 In September 2005, Treasury designated Banco
Delta Asia (BDA) as a primary money laundering concern and published an
NPRM that would bar U.S. banks from providing correspondent banking
services to BDA.18 The proposed rule cited [BDA\'s provision of banking
services to facilitate a variety of criminal activities [and violations
of international law by the government of North
Korea]{.mark}]{.underline}. The rule\'s true target was North Korea, via
BDA as a financial intermediary.19 The effect was immediate: 34 percent
of BDA deposits totaling over US\$130 million were withdrawn in days,
and U.S. banks quickly ceased all business with BDA, cutting it off from
dollar financing. The bank ultimately collapsed and was forced into
receivership. Other banks around the world with links to [the [North
Korean government swiftly cut ties and preemptively froze North Korean
assets, accounts, and transaction]{.mark}]{.underline}[s]{.mark}.20 All
of this unfolded within a year and without any actual sanctions. The
final rule imposing the fifth Section 311 Special Measure (banning
correspondent accounts) was not promulgated until March 2007.21

More recently, the Treasury Department\'s publication in February 2018
of an NPRM that would prohibit Latvian ABLV Bank from maintaining a
correspondent account under Section 311 led the bank to fold within days
of the announcement.22 [[Accused of money laundering, including on
behalf of North Korea\'s nuclear missile program,]{.mark} ABLV faced
immediate deposit outflows and a liquidity crisis following the
announcement]{.underline}. On February 24, 2018, the European Central
Bank announced ABLV would be wound down.23 For now, the United States\'
exorbitant power to sanction remains as strong as ever.

The [Treasury also engages in dollar outcasting using the SDN
list]{.underline}---the list of individuals and entities with whom
transactions by U.S. persons are blocked pursuant to sanctions programs
under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Trading with the
Enemy Act, and other particularized sanctions statutes.24 [[Inclusion on
the SDN list requires U.S. banks and financial institutions to freeze
the assets of the designated entity and to deny additional transactions
with them,]{.mark} effectively limiting their access to existing
financial resources and cutting off access to dollar
financin]{.underline}g (similar to Section 311).

Both of these tools rely on three interrelated features of global dollar
finance for their efficacy. First, the interconnected nature of the
global banking system means that continuing to do business with a
designated entity, or an intermediary of a designated entity under
Section 311, risks exposure to liability. [The bank of a primary money
laundering concern, after all, is also a money launderer]{.underline}.25

Second, and consequent to the first, the choice between [cutting ties
with illicit actors]{.underline}, plus the banks that (allegedly) handle
their money, and [losing access to the U.S. financial market is an easy
one]{.underline}.26 [[No bank will choose the illicit business of a
single client]{.mark}]{.underline} (or even a country or set of clients)
[[over access to dollar clearing services because to do so would kill
the rest of their busine]{.mark}ss]{.underline}.27 Consequently, dollar
sanctions against a foreign financial institution under domestic law
will often result in the isolation of the targeted institution not only
by U.S. banks but by foreign banks who are concerned with maintaining
their dollar market access.

The importance of U.S. financial market access for foreign banks means
that U.S. unilateral financial sanctions often become de facto secondary
sanctions. Indeed, the United States has encouraged this behavior by
reaching out to foreign banks through nonbinding, diplomatic channels to
"educate" them about the risks of continuing to do business with
targeted entities.28 More often than not, it seems to work.

Third, and most critically for the success of dollar outcasting, illicit
actors are [[heavily reliant on the dollar financing system for the same
reasons as everyone else]{.underline}: [there is no
alternative]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} Criminals and rogue
states need banks to conduct business and deposit their assets, and
banks need dollars.29 But because (at least, most) [[banks need dollars
more than they need illicit business, dollar outcasting effectively
compels banks to cut off these actors and starve them of the financing
they]{.mark} nee]{.underline}d. So long as the world relies on
dollar-based finance, rogue actors will find it difficult to escape
targeted dollar sanctions.

Taken, the Way Still Open: Denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and
Northeast Asia,"
<http://www.nautilus.org/fora/security/10001HayesHamalGreen.pdf>)

The international community is increasingly aware that cooperative
diplomacy is the most productive way to tackle the multiple,
interconnected global challenges facing humanity, not least of which is
the increasing proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass
destruction. [[Korea]{.mark} and Northeast Asia [are instances where
risks of]{.mark} nuclear proliferation and actual [nuclear use]{.mark}
arguably [have increased in recent years]{.mark}.]{.underline} This
negative trend is a product of continued US nuclear threat projection
against the DPRK as part of a general program of coercive diplomacy in
this region, North Korea's nuclear weapons programme, the breakdown in
the Chinese-hosted Six Party Talks towards the end of the Bush
Administration, regional concerns over China's increasing military
power, and concerns within some quarters in regional states (Japan,
South Korea, Taiwan) about whether US extended deterrence ("nuclear
umbrella") afforded under bilateral security treaties can be relied upon
for protection. [The consequences of failing to address the
proliferation threat posed by the North Korea developments, and related
political and economic issues, are serious]{.underline}, not only for
the Northeast Asian region but [for the whole international
community.]{.underline} At worst, [[there is the **possibility of
nuclear attack**]{.underline}1, [whether by **intention, miscalculation,
or merely accident**,]{.underline}]{.mark} [[leading to the resumption
of Korean]{.mark} War [hostilities]{.mark}.]{.underline} On the Korean
Peninsula itself, key population centres are well within short or medium
range missiles. The whole of Japan is likely to come within North Korean
missile range. Pyongyang has a population of over 2 million, Seoul
(close to the North Korean border) 11 million, and Tokyo over 20
million. **[[Even a limited nuclear exchange would result in a holocaust
of unprecedented proportions.]{.underline}]{.mark}** But the catastrophe
within the region would not be the only outcome. New research indicates
that even a limited nuclear war in the region would rearrange our global
climate far more quickly than global warming. Westberg draws attention
to new studies modelling the effects of even a limited nuclear exchange
involving approximately 100 Hiroshima-sized 15 kt bombs2 (by comparison
it should be noted that the United States currently deploys warheads in
the range 100 to 477 kt, that is, individual warheads equivalent in
yield to a range of 6 to 32 Hiroshimas).[The [studies indicate]{.mark}
that [the soot from the fires produced would lead to a decrease in
global temperature by 1.25 degrees]{.mark}]{.underline} Celsius for a
period of 6-8 years.3 In Westberg's view: That is not global winter, but
[the [nuclear darkness will cause a deeper drop in temperature than at
any time during the last 1000 years]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
temperature over the continents would decrease substantially more than
the global average. A decrease in rainfall over the continents would
also follow...[The period of nuclear darkness will cause much greater
decrease in grain production than 5% and it will continue for many
years\...[hundreds of millions]{.mark} of people [will die from
hunger]{.mark}]{.underline}...To make matters even worse, [such amounts
of smoke injected into the stratosphere would cause a huge reduction in
the Earth's protective ozone.]{.underline}4 These, of course, are not
the only consequences. [Reactors might also be targeted, causing further
mayhem and downwind radiation effects, superimposed on a smoking,
radiating ruin left by nuclear next-use]{.underline}. Millions of
refugees would flee the affected regions. [The [direct impacts,
and]{.mark} the [follow-on impacts on the global economy via ecological
and food insecurity]{.mark}, [could **make the present global financial
crisis pale by comparison**]{.mark}.]{.underline} How the great powers,
especially the nuclear weapons states respond to such a crisis, and in
particular, whether nuclear weapons are used in response to nuclear
first-use, could make or break the global non proliferation and
disarmament regimes. [[There could be]{.mark} many unanticipated impacts
on regional and global security relationships]{.underline}5, [with
[**subsequent nuclear breakout** and geopolitical turbulence]{.mark},
[including]{.mark} possible [loss-of-control over]{.mark} fissile
material or [warheads in the chaos of nuclear war]{.mark}, [and
**aftermath chain-reaction affects involving other potential proliferant
states**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} The Korean nuclear proliferation
issue is not just a regional threat but a global one that warrants
priority consideration from the international community.

of several dozen nuclear weapons.

#### Petrodollar key to containing civil crisis in Ukraine - heightened tensions guarantee Russia attack

**Synder 14\'** (May 13,2014 Micheal , \"De-Dollarization: Russia Is On
The Verge Of Dealing A Massive Blow To The Petrodollar\" ,
theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/de-dollarization-russia-is-on-the-verge-of-dealing-a-massive-blow-to-the-petrodollar)

So why is the petrodollar so important?

[Well, it [creates a tremendous amount of demand for the U.S. dollar all
over the globe]{.mark}.]{.underline} Since everyone has needed it to
trade with one another, that has created an endless global appetite for
the currency. That has kept the value of the dollar artificially high,
and it has enabled us to import trillions of dollars of super cheap
products from other countries. If other nations stopped using the dollar
to trade with one another, the value of the dollar would plummet
dramatically and we would have to pay much, much more for the trinkets
that we buy at the dollar store and Wal-Mart.

In addition, since the [U.S. dollar [is essentially the de facto global
currency, this]{.mark} has also increased demand for our
debt.]{.underline} Major exporting nations such as China and Saudi
Arabia end up with giant piles of our dollars. Instead of just letting
them sit there and do nothing, those nations often reinvest their
dollars into securities that can rapidly be changed back into dollars if
needed. One of the most popular ways to do this has been to invest those
dollars in U.S. Treasuries. This has driven down interest rates on U.S.
debt over the years and has enabled the U.S. government to borrow
trillions upon trillions of dollars for next to nothing.

[But if the [rest of the world starts moving away from the U.S.
dollar]{.mark}, all of this could change.]{.underline}

In order for our current standard of living to continue, it is
absolutely imperative that everyone else around the globe continues to
use our currency.

[So if [Russia really does pull the trigger on a
"de-dollarization]{.mark}]{.underline}" strategy, that would be huge --
especially if the rest of the planet started following their lead.

The [U.S. [economy is already teetering on the brink of another major
downturn]{.mark}]{.underline}, and there are a whole host of indications
that big trouble is on the horizon. For much more on this, please see
the article that I posted on Monday entitled "If Economic Cycle
Theorists Are Correct, 2015 To 2020 Will Be Pure Hell For The United
States".

[Just [about the last thing that we need right now is for our
petrodollar monopoly to be threatened]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[It would be nice if things would calm down in
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} and the relationship between the United
States and Russia could go back to normal.

[Sadly, that does [not appear likely any time soon]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In fact, the [[Ukrainian]{.mark} government has already admitted that
["]{.mark}]{.underline}[we are essentially at
war]{.mark}["]{.underline}, and on Tuesday six Ukrainian soldiers were
killed and eight were wounded in a [c[onvoy attack in]{.mark} eastern
[Ukraine]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The [regions in eastern Ukraine that have just declared independence
have given the government in Kiev until Wednesday]{.underline} to pull
their forces out of eastern Ukraine or else face war.

If [[a full blown civil war does erupt in Ukraine]{.mark}, it is going
to [take this crisis to a completely new level]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Unfortunately, most Americans are incredibly apathetic at this point and
know very little about what is going on.

[But in the [end, this could have dramatic implications for all]{.mark}
of us]{.underline}.

#### Heightened Ukraine tensions cause nuclear war and undermine international coop on climate change, terrorism, cyber, and nuclear prolif. Independently, increases Chinese aggression 

**Legvold 14** \[Robert Legvold is Marshall D. Shulman Professor
Emeritus at Columbia University. Managing the New Cold War.
2014. https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2014-06-16/managing-new-cold-war\]

That hope is now gone. **[The crisis in Ukraine has pushed the two sides
over a cliff and into a new relationship]{.underline},** one not
softened by the ambiguity that defined the last decade of the post--Cold
War period, when each party viewed the other as neither friend nor
foe**.[Russia and the West are now adversaries]{.underline}.**

Although **[this new Cold War]{.underline} **will be fundamentally
different from the original, it **[will still be immensely
damaging]{.underline}.** Unlike the original, the new one won't
encompass the entire global system. The world is no longer bipolar, and
significant regions and key players, such as China and India, will avoid
being drawn in. In addition, the new conflict will not pit one "ism"
against another, nor will it likely unfold under the permanent threat of
nuclear Armageddon. Yet the new Cold War will affect nearly every
important dimension of the international system, and Putin's emphasis on
Russia's alienation from contemporary Western cultural values will add
to the estrangement. Finally,** [were a]{.underline} [security crisis in
the center of Europe to escalate, the danger of nuclear
war could quickly return]{.underline}.**

For both Moscow and Washington, then, [the top priority must be
to contain the conflict]{.underline}, ensuring that it ends up being as
short and as shallow as possible. To achieve that goal, both sides must
carefully study the lessons of the original Cold War. During that
conflict, the two sides, despite their bitter rivalry, were eventually
able to develop a variety of mechanisms for reducing tensions and
containing risks. By the 1970s, U.S. and Russian leaders had come to see
managing the contest and focusing on areas of cooperation, especially
nuclear arms control, as their principal tasks. Without discounting the
fundamental differences that set them at odds, leaders on both sides
embraced the wisdom of engaging, rather than isolating, the other.
Toward the end of the original Cold War, the earnest, albeit fumbling,
efforts of U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet Premier Mikhail
Gorbachev to understand what drove each other greatly influenced the
final outcome. Today, as leaders in Moscow and Washington move in the
other direction, they might pause and reflect on how the wisest among
their predecessors approached the original Cold War.

THE BIG CHILL

For all the differences between the two periods, the new Cold War will
share many of its predecessor's features. First,** [Russian and Western
leaders have already begun framing the standoff in unforgiving
terms]{.underline} \-- [much as their predecessors did at the start of
the first Cold War]{.underline}**, most famously with Soviet Premier
Joseph Stalin's February 1946 preelection speech and British Prime
Minister Winston Churchill's Iron Curtain speech a month later. This
past March, for example, Putin defended Russia's annexation of Crimea by
saying that Washington and its European allies were guided by "the rule
of the gun" rather than international law and were convinced that their
"exceptionalism" allowed them to unlawfully use force against sovereign
states, "building coalitions based on the principle, 'If you are not
with us, you are against us.'" In May, Alexander Vershbow, the deputy
secretary-general of NATO, asserted that Russia should now be considered
"more of an adversary than a partner."

Second, as in the early phases of the original Cold War, each side sees
the conflict as a result solely of the actions \-- or even the nature
\-- of the other. Neither pays attention to the complicated interactions
that brought relations to their present low. This preoccupation with
pinning fault on the other side recalls attitudes during the late 1950s
and early 1960s, when each side viewed the other as inherently alien.
Only after surviving the perils of the Berlin crisis of 1958--61 and the
Cuban missile crisis in 1962 did the Americans and the Soviets step back
and consider where their interests converged. Over the next ten years,
they negotiated three major arms control agreements: the Limited Test
Ban Treaty, the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and the first Strategic
Arms Limitation Talks (SALT I).

Third, as during much of the original Cold War, neither side now expects
much from the relationship. Isolated moments of cooperation might emerge
when the two sides' interests on specific issues happen to coincide. But
neither believes it feasible to pursue cooperation across a broad front
with the aim of changing the nature of the relationship overall. Nor
does either camp seem willing to take the first step in that direction.

Fourth, to punish Moscow and to signal the price it will pay for further
aggression, Washington has resorted to a series of Cold War--style
reprisals. Beginning in March, it put military-to-military activities
with Russia on hold and ended missile defense negotiations. The Obama
administration has also banned the export to Russia of civilian
technology with potential military applications, suspended cooperation
with Russia on civilian nuclear energy projects, cut off NASA's contacts
with its Russian counterpart, and denied Russian specialists access to
the laboratories of the U.S. Department of Energy. Many of these
measures will likely remain in place after the Ukraine crisis ends. And
even those that are lifted will leave a corrosive residue.

Fifth, and most serious, just as the confrontation over security in the
heart of Europe constituted the epicenter of the original Cold War,
renewed uncertainty over central and eastern Europe's stability will
drive this one as well. Beginning in the 1990s, NATO's expansion into
much of eastern Europe, including the Baltic states, moved Europe's
political-military border to the edges of the former Soviet Union. NATO
enlargement also transformed Belarus, Moldova, and Ukraine into the new
"lands in between," successors to Poland and the parts of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire that the great powers fought over, with tragic
results, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Today, as Moscow
fortifies its Western Military District, a key military command, and
NATO refocuses on Russia, the military standoff over continental Europe,
which took two decades to dismantle, will swiftly be reconstituted on
Europe's eastern edge.

RED ZONE

Some might assume that the new Cold War, although undesirable, won't
matter nearly as much as the last one did, especially since modern
Russia presents a mere shadow of the threat once posed by the Soviet
Union. It is true, of course, that the United States enjoys massive
material advantages over its adversary: its economy is around eight
times as large as Russia's, and its military budget is seven times as
large. Moreover, the magnitude of the other challenges Washington faces,
from turbulence in the Middle East to rising tensions in the
Asia-Pacific, might make a collapse of Russia's relations with the
United States and most of Europe seem relatively unimportant.

But **[to doubt the likelihood or significance of a
prolonged confrontation would be deeply misguided]{.underline}.** In
truth, **[if Russia and the United States approach each other in
starkly adversarial terms, the conflict will badlywarp the foreign
policies of
both countries, damage virtually every important dimension of international
politics, and divert attention]{.underline}** and
resources** [from]{.underline}** the** [major security challenges]{.underline} **of

Consider Washington's position in the Asia-Pacific, toward which it has
for several years now intended to rebalance its diplomatic and military
resources.** [Recent events in Ukraine have already caused Tokyo to
fear that Washington's new focus on Europe will diminish its commitment
to Asia]{.underline} \-- [and]{.underline}**, more specifically, **[its
commitment to helping Japan ward off a rising
China]{.underline}. [Japanese
leaders even worry that Obama's]{.underline} **relatively** [mild
response to Moscow's annexation of Crimea foreshadows how Washington
would react if Beijing seized the
disputed Senkaku Islands]{.underline} **(known in China as the Diaoyu
Islands), in the East China Sea. Moreover, a** [belligerent
Russia will have every incentive to hinder, rather than help,
the United States' efforts to manage the delicate task of
deterring Chinese aggression]{.underline} **while widening the sphere of
U.S.-Chinese cooperation. Similarly,** [at a time when Washington needs
Russian cooperation to address new sources of global
disorder]{.underline}, [Moscow will instead step
aside]{.underline}, [impairing U.S. efforts to deal
with terrorism, climate change, nuclear
proliferation, and cyberwarfare]{.underline}.**

The pressure to reorient U.S. defense planning to meet what many members
of the U.S. Congress and many of Washington's eastern European allies
see as a revived Russian military threat will complicate the Pentagon's
effort to save money by modernizing and downsizing. The U.S. military,
which is currently focused on counterterrorism and securing access to
the seas surrounding China, will now have to beef up its capabilities to
fight a ground war in Europe.

The new Cold War with the United States and Europe will hurt Russia even
more, especially because Moscow is much more dependent on the West than
vice versa, in at least one critical respect. To diversify its
resource-dependent economy and modernize its aging, Soviet-era
infrastructure, Russia has counted on an inflow of Western capital and
technology. To the degree that this option is lost, Moscow will be
forced to become vastly more dependent either on its relationship with
Beijing \-- in which it is a distinctly junior partner \-- or on
scattered partnerships with countries that do not offer anything
resembling the resources of the United States and Europe.

Only four years ago, after the global financial crisis had laid bare the
weakness of the Russian economy, then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev
argued that the country sorely needed "special alliances for
modernization" with the United States and the countries of the EU. But
now, as the crisis in Russia's relations with those countries deepens,
Russia is already feeling the crunch, as capital is fleeing the country,
its credit markets are shrinking, and its economy will soon enter a
recession.

Such economic hardship may prompt Russian leaders to preemptively clamp
down on domestic dissent even harder than they already have to avert
potential social unrest at home, which would mean a level of repression
that could backfire and at some point produce the very kind of
widespread opposition the Kremlin fears. Meanwhile, Russia's poisoned
relations with the United States and its European allies might well lead
such Russian partners as Armenia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan \-- all of
which are crucial to Russia's plans for a Eurasian economic union and a
stronger Collective Security Treaty Organization \-- to subtly distance
themselves from Moscow for fear of tainting their own relationships with
the Western powers.

The new confrontation with the West will also force Russia to stretch
its military resources thin. That will leave Moscow poorly equipped to
handle a host of other security challenges, such as violence in the
northern Caucasus and instability in Central Asia, the latter of which
is compounded by the unpredictable futures facing Afghanistan and
Pakistan. Russia must also defend its vast border with China and prepare
for a potential conflict between North and South Korea.

PRESSURE POINTS

The collapse of Russia's relations with the West will not only distort
U.S., European, and Russian foreign policy but also inflict serious harm
on a broad array of international issues. What still remains of the arms
control regime that took Russia and the United States years to build
will now largely come undone. The new Cold War has eliminated any chance
that Moscow and Washington will resolve their differences over missile
defense, a Russian precondition for further strategic arms control
agreements. Instead,** [the two sides will likely
start developing new and potentially destabilizing technologies,
including advanced precision-guided
conventional weapons and cyberwarfare tools]{.underline}.**

Meanwhile, the European component of the U.S. missile defense program
will now likely take on a specifically anti-Russian character,
particularly because the Obama administration reportedly believes that
Russia has violated the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.
And it is unlikely that Moscow and Washington will be able to agree on
how to place limits on the deployment of major weapons systems in
Europe. The new Cold War has also dashed any hopes of strengthening
other basic agreements, such as the 1992 Treaty on Open Skies, which
regulates unarmed aerial surveillance flights.

Geostrategic calculations will now also assume a far more dominant role
in U.S.-Russian energy relations. Each side will attempt to use the oil
and gas trade to gain leverage over the other and minimize its own
vulnerability. In the Arctic, the chances for U.S.-Russian cooperation
in developing that region's vast hydrocarbon reserves will surely
shrink. More broadly, the new Cold War will set back international
efforts to deal with the impact of climate change on the Arctic \-- an
issue on which U.S.-Russian relations have been surprisingly
cooperative.

One of the most successful but underappreciated aspects of recent
U.S.-Russian relations has been the progress made by the 20 working
groups of the U.S.-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission, which was
established in 2009 to facilitate high-level cooperation on a range of
policies, from prison reform and military education to civilian
emergencies and counterterrorism. It seems unlikely that such
cooperation will continue, much less improve, during the new Cold War.
Moscow and Washington will also struggle to align their positions on key
matters of global governance, including the much-needed reforms of the
UN, the International Monetary Fund, and the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe. Washington is now focused on excluding Russia
where possible (from the G-8, for example) and circumscribing Russia's
role elsewhere. Meanwhile, Moscow will work harder than before to
supplant U.S. and European influence in these institutions.

Finally, [should one or more of the long-simmering conflicts in
the post-Soviet region again explode, the chances that Russia and the
United States would act together to contain the violence seem close to
zero]{.underline}. [Instead, were Nagorno-Karabakh, in Azerbaijan, or
Transnistria, in Moldova, to blow up, Moscow and Washington would both
be far more likely to focus on counteracting what they each saw as the
malevolent role of the other]{.underline}.

Explanantion\"
https://www.thebalance.com/ukraine-crisis-summary-and-explanation-3970462

The Ukraine crisis is a power struggle between factions within Ukraine.
One wants to align with the European Union and the other with Russia.
Ukraine had been an important contributor to the Soviet Union\'s economy
between 1920 and 1991. The current crisis erupted on June 7, 2014,
pro-West president Petro Poroshenko replaced pro-Russia president Viktor
Yanukovych. On September 12, 2014, Ukraine approved a trade deal with
the EU that removed export tariffs. It agreed to delay its
implementation a year to avoid Russian energy sanctions and even
attacks. Ukraine President Poroshenko wanted to maintain the cease-fire.
The current crisis erupted in March 2014, when Russian special forces
occupied Ukraine\'s Crimean peninsula. Russia claimed it was protecting
its port access to the Black Sea. Russian President Vladimir Putin
Ukraine had planned to develop Crimea\'s natural gas reserves in two
years in a partnership with U.S. companies. If Ukraine had accomplished
this, Russia would have lost one of its largest customers. Between 2014
and 2018, a military conflict between Ukrainian soldiers and
Russian-backed separatists has continued in eastern Ukraine. More than
10,000 people have been killed. On November 25, 2018, Russian ships
attacked and boarded three Ukrainian vessels in the Crimean port of Azov
near the Black Sea. It placed a freighter to block the port. It said
Ukraine has violated Russian waters. The two sides signed an agreement
in 2003 to guarantee free passage through the strait. In recent months,
they\'ve been harassing each other's ships. Critics at the United
Nations Security Council meeting said Russia\'s attack was a violation
under international law. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization
increased its military presence in the area. Putin\'s attack responded
to the February 23 overthrow of his ally Viktor Yanukovych. The pro-West
faction of Ukraine\'s Parliament took over the government. The crisis
occurred because Yanukovych mismanaged the budget. He forced Ukraine to
ask for financial help. It appealed to the EU, then Russia. The
political unrest occurred at this point. Those who wanted to be closer
to the EU objected when that solution was abandoned. Russia\'s military
strike supported Yanukovych\'s return to Kiev and closer ties to Russia.
In April 2014, Russia supported local rebels who took over city halls
and police stations throughout eastern Ukraine. That area is home to
ethnic Russians who don\'t want to be part of the EU. Those Russians
were moved there 50 years ago by Joseph Stalin, who intended to
strengthen the Soviet Republic\'s hold on the area. Earlier that month,
NATO revealed satellite photos showing Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine\'s
eastern border. An EU emergency meeting added further sanctions on
Russia\'s oil and banking sectors. That occurred shortly after Russia
sent a convoy of trucks over the border. They were bearing aid to
Ukraine\'s eastern cities, held by pro-Russian rebels. Several of those
trucks entered without approval. Ukraine had also destroyed a convoy of
Russian military vehicles. They were bringing arms to the rebels. It was
the first time that Ukraine attacked Russian forces directly. A few days
later, Ukraine reported that several military vehicles were near the
Russian border at the Crimean port of Azov. It claimed that Russia was
creating a second front for the rebels. Russia also wanted land access
through southern Ukraine. It wanted a shorter route to Crimea. In July,
Russia built up its military force on the border. There were 19,000 to
21,000 troops, 14 advanced surface-to-air missile units, and 30
artillery batteries. It was a battle-ready force that could launch an
attack into eastern Ukraine at a moment\'s notice. [[Russia had already
launched rockets across the border in support of Ukrainian
rebels]{.mark}. [Putin\'s standoff over ]{.mark}]{.underline}[Ukraine
[boosted his popularity rating]{.underline}]{.mark} [in Russia to 80
percent. [To maintain this popularity, he will continue to hold onto
Ukraine despite the cost]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, it would
cost Russia more than \$20 billion through 2020 to integrate Crimea.
Putin knows that NATO won\'t protect Ukraine since it is not a member.
That emboldens him to continue to attack. [Ukraine had been
the]{.underline} second-most important contributo[r to the former Soviet
Union\'s economy]{.underline}. It provided one-fourth of Soviet
agricultural output. It supplied heavy industrial equipment and raw
materials to industrial sites throughout the former USSR. On July 29,
2014, the United States and the EU extended economic sanctions against
Russia. They wanted to convince Putin to stop supporting those in
eastern Ukraine who want to break up the country. The United States had
proof that Russia supplied separatists that shot down a Malaysia
Airlines commercial jet over eastern Ukraine on July 17, killing 298
people. The sanctions severely limit five out of the six major Russian
banks\' ability to obtain medium and long-term financing from Europe.
The United States also restricted technology exports to Russia\'s
deep-water Arctic offshore or shale oil production. Russia had already
been ousted from the Group of Eight. As a result of U.S. sanctions,
British Petroleum was worried about its profits. Bank of America cut its
exposure to Russia by 40 percent. Boeing and United Technologies started
hoarding titanium. Russia\'s VSMPO is the world\'s largest producer of
this rare metal. In response, Russia banned imports of U.S. and European
foods for one year. This included \$300 million of U.S. poultry
products. After the sanctions, foreign direct investment in Russia
dropped by \$75 billion. That\'s roughly 4 percent of the country\'s
gross domestic product. Its stock market plummeted 20 percent. Its
currency, the ruble, fell 50 percent. To head off inflation, Russia\'s
central bank raised interest rates. The sanctions created a recession in
Russia. The International Monetary Fund cut its 2014 growth forecast for
Russia from 3.8 percent to 0.2 percent. Even though Putin continues to
be popular at home, these sanctions are hurting the country\'s economy.
Russia is one of the emerging markets that suffered a currency meltdown
in 2014. Forex traders abandoned these markets when the Federal Reserve
began tapering its quantitative easing program. That reduced credit
around the world. Russia waged wars in Chechnya in the early 2000s.
Putin annexed Ossetia in Georgia in 2008, and the Western world didn\'t
really intervene. He also successfully launched a cyber-attack on
Estonia. But Ukraine is larger and borders the EU directly. Many small
countries bordering Russia worried that if Ukraine falls, they would be
next. The EU is unlikely to defend them since it depends on Russia for
half of its gas. Many European businesses have profitable operations in
Russia. Others sympathize with Putin, who is defending Russia\'s borders
from encroachment by NATO. Annexation of Crimea worries 260,000 Muslim
Tatars. They were subjected to ethnic cleansing during the Soviet rule.
They were forced to move to Central Asia, where half of them died.
Crimean Tatars peacefully supported Ukraine\'s Orange Revolution.

Against The West, Skobov
Says\"euromaidanpress.com/2019/03/09/putin-is-preparing-to-fight-and-win-a-limited-nuclear-war-against-the-west-skobov-says/

[Putin [is preparing to fight and win a]{.underline} ]{.mark}[limited
[nuclear war]{.mark},]{.underline} convinced that "the effete West will
refuse to escalate" in response lest that lead to a nuclear Armageddon
that will destroy both the Russian Federation and the West, according to
Moscow commentator **[Aleksandr
Skobov](http://euromaidanpress.com/?s=Aleksandr+Skobov).** The Cold War
doctrine was based on the assumption that neither super power would ever
use nuclear weapons for offense but only in defense and that both would
be prepared to escalate if the other acted first, an assumption that
provided less certainty that war could be avoided than many now believe,
Skobov says. On the one hand, each side had developed plans for using
tactical and then strategic weapons if the other side used them. And on
the other, the commentator continues, both had to continue to invest in
ever more apocalyptic weapons as the last line of defense of what each
viewed as its civilizational model. According to Skobov, "both sides
were certain of the superiority of their own social system and in the
eventual collapse of the social system of their opponent in a global
defeat in the historical competition." In essence, "both sides
considered a global military clash with their historical opponents as
practically inevitable." Moreover, both sides concluded that they might
be pushed to the use of nuclear weapons if the use of conventional ones
was not allowing them to win out. [[NATO]{.mark} doctrine [held that in
the event of a Soviet tank]{.mark} thrust into Europe, [the western
alliance would have to use tactical nuclear
weapons.]{.mark}]{.underline} **"In the USSR," Skobov continues, "the
doctrine of 'a responsive nuclear strike' was adopted officially, but in
fact, the General Staff considered a sufficient basis for a \[Soviet\]
nuclear strike only the possibility that the first strike might be
inflicted by \[the USSR's\] opponents."** And because neither side could
be certain what might happen, each was prepared to escalate in response,
something that both sides recognized and that was ultimately the reason
that neither side used those weapons against the other lest its
civilizational model be destroyed along with the world. "Until
Gorbachev's [perestroika]{.underline}**,"** Skobov says, "all attempts
not only to begin the process of disarmament or even to freeze the
number of weapons at a certain level turned out to be hopeless" as a
result. "All 'pre-[perestroika]{.underline}**'** Soviet-American
treaties were only agreements about reducing the tempo of the building
of arms." The world was thus drifting toward a nuclear war, a horrific
outcome that was prevented only by the decision of the Soviet leadership
under Gorbachev to reject its global political goals, its ideology, its
faith in the supremacy of its social system, and its efforts to impose
that system on others by defeating its opponent. By refusing to view the
West as an inevitable enemy, the Soviet leadership made possible arms
control deals that reduced the number of nuclear weapons of the two
sides by 80 percent. "Russian imperialists call this a geopolitical
capitulation, but the alternative to it was nuclear war," Skobov argues.
But now what Gorbachev did is being reversed. **Putin's "organized
criminal group" even though it has not articulated an ideology views
itself as "'the elect of history,' called upon to send into the trash
heap all this 'Western project' with its 'false democracy,' 'false'
humanism, and 'false' human rights."** This is not "a return to Soviet
ideology," Skobov insists. "The Soviet empire claimed that namely it was
the true legal heir of the Renaissance-Enlightenment project and the
heir of 1789 which proclaimed 'freedom, equality, and brotherhood.'" The
Putinists, in contrast, "are convinced that there are no 'true' human
rights and that democracy doesn't exist in nature." For Putin and his
acolytes, "there is only loot and crude force and the eternal universal
laws of criminal groups." It "doesn't seek to be the heir of 1789: it
rejects that inheritance just as Hitler did." And that points up
something else: "the ideological gap separating the Putin empire and the
West is much deeper than the one which divided the West and the Soviet
empire." Putin's "organized criminal group" may not believe that Western
elites have any moral limitations, "but it cannot but understand that
NATO does not have a single reason in the event of a military conflict
to use nuclear weapons first." That is because today, NATO has
superiority over Russia "in other kinds of arms." Equally, the Putin
people "cannot but know" that neither side has an effective defense
against strategic nuclear missiles "and in the coming decades won't"
either. To ensure that the principles of mutually assured destruction
continue to work as a constraint, Skobov says, "no new "super weapons"
are needed. Then, why is Putin talking about them? In fact, [[he]{.mark}
[is]{.mark}n't [talking about]{.mark} strategic weapons that could be
used to bring on Armageddon but rather [precisely targeted ones that
could serve as the weapon of choice for "a limited nuclear strike,
including a first strike"]{.mark}]{.underline} rather than in response
to the actions of the West. Putin is "certainly not preparing for
complete mutual destruction," Skobov says. **"He is preparing for a
limited nuclear war which he hopes to win." His hopes rest on his
conviction that the West now will not respond to a Russian use of
tactical nuclear weapons by escalating but by doing everything possible
to de-escalate.** As in the first Cold War, the commentator continues,
"the world's slide toward a nuclear catastrophe can be stopped only by
Russia turning away from its confrontation with the West" based on
Moscow's belief that its system is superior and the West's is rotting
from within because it is not. But tragically, "today there are no
forces within the country capable of turning Russia" in a different
direction. And the world is rapidly running out of time. "Therefore,"
Skobov says, "the first order of business is the formation of a broad
international anti-Putin coalition, which recognizes the threat coming
from the Kremlin and is ready to respond to Putin's strike."

## U.S. Heg

### 1NC

#### Maintaining the dollar's status is key to [overall hegemony]{.underline}---foreign policy leverage and military spending.

University. \*\*Angela Keys, Thomas University. "The US Dollar as the
Global Reserve Currency: Implications for US Hegemony." *World Review of
Political Economy* 8(1): 104-22. Emory Libraries.

US hegemony has been the subject of study from many varied perspectives
in different historical contexts. Anderson (2013), for example, has
argued that US hegemony rose to cover the planet from the earliest years
of US history. He contends that the US imperium had a long prehistory
stretching back to its founding. In the post-Cold War era, Johnson
(2004, 151) has argued that a new form of US hegemony has emerged where
US military bases constitute an \"empire of bases.\" In this article, we
argue that **[the role of [the]{.mark} US [dollar as the]{.mark} global
[reserve currency should be seen as central to the functioning of US
hegemony]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[The benefits]{.mark}
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[has derived from the dollar\'s reserve currency status [are
crucial]{.mark}]{.underline}**, for instance, **[[to]{.mark} the
[maintenance of military bases and other aspects of US]{.mark} hegemonic
[power]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Robert Keohane, for example, has done
considerable work on how **[US hegemony is structurally
comprised]{.underline}**. In After Hegemony (2005), first published in
1984, Keohane argued that cooperation among capitalist powers would
continue even without a single hegemon. Keohane\'s study lacks
significant explanation of the role of reserve currencies or financial
markets in how cooperation occurs between state actors. Susan Strange
(1987) critiques hegemonic stability theory. Strange argues that a
critical reason for hegemonic change \"in the great game of states\"
\"is primarily economic, not political\" (Strange 1987, 553). While
Strange does consider the role of the US dollar and its reserve status,
it is relegated to third position in a list of structural reasons for
the conditions that give rise to US hegemony. In contrast, we argue that
**[the dollar and its reserve status is the most fundamental reason that
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[is a hegemonic power]{.underline}**. Emmanuel Wallerstein\'s (1991)
study focuses on the changing worlds system in the 1980s. The collapse
of the Soviet Union and the evolution of the world system in the context
of a declining US hegemony are seen as major changes to the capitalist
world economy. Absent from Wallerstein\'s (1991) study is any analysis
of the dollar and its reserve function in how hegemony is constructed.

Critical contributions have been made by Michael Hudson and Henry C.K.
Liu to scholarship on the US dollar with regard to US hegemony. Hudson
(2003) has presented a critical history of the US dollar and how **[the
political power attained through the selection of the dollar as the
global reserve currency has served the interests of the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. However, this study
was published prior to the financial crash of 2008. The global financial
crisis (GFC) has had a large impact on the debates surrounding whether
the dollar can be maintained in the face of this disruption (Overholt et
al. 2015). Furthermore, since Hudson\'s (2003) study was published,
there have been several major developments in the realm of political
economy that concern the dollar and its continued reserve status. First,
**[the increasing use of the Yuan in bilateral trade between Russian and
China]{.underline}**, particularly for hydrocarbon payments, has the
potential to undermine US hegemony by creating a system outside the
control of the US banking system, the China International Payments
System (CIPS) (Koneig 2015). Another critical feature which occurred
after Hudson (2003) was **[the creation of the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank]{.underline}** (AIIB). Officially the bank is intended
to meet the infrastructure investment needs of the Asian region and will
be used to fund \"The New Silk Road\" project for example. However, this
institution will be under the direction of the Chinese in concert with
multilateral partners. These developments **[indicate a challenge to a
US-centric world system and raise the possibility of a regional sphere
of influence dominated by Russia and China in East and particularly
Central]{.underline}** Asia. This evolution of Russian Chinese
cooperation is a direct threat to the hegemony of the United States in
Central Asia as Zbigniew Brzezinski in The Grand Chessboard (1997)
theorised could happen. Liu (2002) has analysed the role of the dollar
in the operations of US hegemony. Liu contends that since Nixon
abandoned the gold standard in 1971, the US dollar has become a \"global
monetary instrument that only the United States can produce by fiat.\"
According to Liu, the rest of the world produces goods, and the United
States produces dollars that are required to purchase these goods,
particularly oil. **[As US [dollars are needed to facilitate global
trade]{.mark}, this consequently positions the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[at the centre of a
global trading system in which it is the dominant power]{.underline}**.
Liu (2002) asserts the contention that **[the unique role the dollar
occupies allows the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[to
manipulate the currency at will and that China must live with the
consequences]{.underline}** (349). Liu and Deng\'s (2012) study
identifies a more recent contention between the US dollar and the
Chinese RMB centred on the sensitive issue of currency devaluation.
However, little theoretical interpretation is given to how this is made
possible. Here we fill this gap by positing that a world systems
analysis is the best way of understanding the interconnected
relationship between the dollar and other currencies.

Prasad (2014) has argued that despite the difficulties that the US
dollar and the US economy confront, the role of the US dollar in
international finance through its reserve function will endure for the
foreseeable future. Prasad emphasises the strengthening of the dollar
since the GFC and asserts that the existing superiority of Western legal
and financial institutions make the role of the dollar secure. Prasad
notes that it has long been a source of contention that **[holders of US
Treasury bonds are, in effect, subsidising US deficit spending and the
standard of living of Americans through their purchase of US
debt]{.underline}**. This phenomenon has been come to be known as the
\"exorbitant privilege\" (Canzoneri et al. 2013). Nonetheless, as the
United States\' NIC has suggested,

**[[Despite]{.mark} recent [inflows]{.mark} into dollar assets and the
appreciation of the dollar, [the dollar could lose its status]{.mark} as
an unparalleled global reserve currency [by 2025]{.mark}, and become a
first among equals in a market basket of currencies]{.underline}**. This
may force the US to consider more carefully how the conduct of its
foreign policy affects the dollar. Without a steady source of external
demand for dollars, **[US foreign policy actions might bring exposure to
currency shock and higher interest rates for Americans]{.underline}**.
(NIC 2008, 12)

**[The dollar and its position as the global reserve currency are
fundamental to the US economy and]{.underline}** are, as a consequence,
**[critical to the funding of both US domestic and foreign
policies]{.underline}**. As financial transactions can be conducted
instantly across the globe, it has been suggested that **[\"[a nation\'s
currency security is]{.mark} even [more critical than energy]{.mark}
security\"]{.underline}** (Engdahl 2014, 10). Rickards (2011) has
examined the geo-strategic and defence posture that the United States
maintains in relation to the dollar, **[exploring the impact future
financial attacks may have on the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates**[\' geo-strategic rivalry with other
nations]{.underline}**. Rickards (2011, 6) highlights the staging of
simulated games on this subject, which were held at the Applied Physics
laboratory near Washington in conjunction with the Department of Defence
in September 2008. The purpose of the games was to \"examine the impact
of global financial activities on national security issues\" (Rickards
2011, 6). Rickards (2011, 11) argues that **[such an attack on
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[would undermine confidence in the dollar]{.underline}** and
emphasises the existence of US presidential powers which permit the
freezing of accounts that attempt to disrupt markets in this way.

Eichengreen (2011) has offered a different view on the dollar\'s status
globally, reasoning that in the future it is likely that there will be a
basket of currencies in operation within the world economy. Noting that
there is an historical precedent for multiple reserve currencies,
Eichengreen (2011) contends, nonetheless, that reports of the dollar\'s
imminent demise as the global reserve currency are premature, if not
entirely unfounded. However, a question must be raised as to whether the
United States would allow the world economy to abandon the dollar as the
global reserve, given the potential ramifications such a move would have
for the US economy and for US hegemony globally.

5.The Dollar and US Hegemony: A World-Systems Analysis Perspective

Immanuel Wallerstein\'s conception of World-Systems Analysis has
provided a theoretical perspective that is key to the investigation of
the US dollar\'s significance as the global reserve currency.
Wallerstein (2011) has asserted that the world system is divided into
core, semi-peripheral and peripheral states. We contend that **[the US
dollar as the global reserve currency is an instrument that has been
critical to the establishment of the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[as the ultimate metropole power at the core
of this world system]{.underline}**.

The strategizing undertaken by planners from the CFR and the US State
Department at the beginning of World War II was fundamental to the
installation of the United States at the core of the post-war world
system. The economic consequences of the war for European nations,
particularly Britain, provided a context for the United States to assume
a pivotal role in the post-war era. Beeson and Higgott (2005) have
argued that, after World War II, the United States became the
pre-eminent global power by positioning itself, \"at the centre of a
dense web of \'hub and spokes\' security relationships.\" As Beeson and
Higgott (2005) have explained, **[the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates also **[created an
international political and economic framework conducive to its
interests, with the multilateral institutions necessary to maintain
them]{.underline}**. Nonetheless, **[it was the selection of
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates**[\']{.underline}** **[currency as the global
reserve which ensured that the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[was at the centre of the world
economy]{.underline}** in the post-war period. Th**[e US dollar became
the essential means of international trade between core, semi-periphery
and periphery states]{.underline}** following the end of World War II.

Wallerstein (2006) has provided an analysis of US hegemony from the end
of World War II to the beginning of the twenty-first century. He
contends that an 80-year battle was waged between the United States and
Germany to determine who would succeed Britain as the new world hegemon.
Wallerstein\'s analysis of US power in relation to the world system
identified three distinct periods, the first of which commenced when
Allied victory in World War II established a period of US global
hegemony that endured until 1970. The second period, from 1970 to 2001,
was when US hegemony entered into decline. The third phase began with
the unilateralist policies of President George W. Bush. These policies
were devised to slow down and reverse the decline in US hegemony. In
practice, Wallerstein asserts, they accelerated US hegemonic decline.
Like Wallerstein, Golub (2004) has emphasised that the unilateralist
approach adopted by the Bush administration has led to a serious decline
in the international influence of the United States.

From the end of World War II until the present, the United States has
encountered challenges to its position as the global hegemonic power.
The United States has undergone a transformation economically and
industrially, and, as a manufacturer and exporter of goods, the United
States has certainly declined. **[[Although other aspects of US]{.mark}
hegemonic [influence have changed, the status of the]{.mark} US
[dollar]{.mark} as the global reserve currency [has not yet been]{.mark}
successfully [challenged]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[The power and
influence of the US dollar as the global reserve is often overlooked as
a hegemonic instrument, particularly as there are more obvious
expressions of US hegemonic power]{.underline}**, such as the presence
of US military bases on every continent except Antarctica. **[As an
enduring feature of US hegemony that continues to link the world
economy, [the]{.mark} US [dollar as the global reserve currency can be
viewed]{.mark}]{.underline}**, potentially, **[[as the most vital
element of US hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

6.Conclusion: Future Challenges to the Dollar\'s Status as the Global
Reserve Currency

One potential challenge to the US dollar\'s future as the global reserve
currency, identified by economist Robert Triffin, has come to be known
as the \"Triffin Dilemma\" or the \"Triffin Paradox.\" Triffin (1960)
argued that the selection of a nation\'s currency as the global reserve
currency would create problems for that nation in the form of
conflicting economic demands. Such a nation would eventually experience
a critical balance of payments problem, particularly in its current
account deficit. Triffin criticised the Bretton Woods monetary system
adopted at the end of World War II which established what he interpreted
as an irreconcilable economic paradox for the United States. **[Whether
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[will experience a future economic crisis cannot be known; however, US
[debt has certainly grown enormously]{.mark}]{.underline}** since the
end of World War II. The unrelenting demand for US dollars created by
the currency\'s establishment as the global reserve has enabled the
United States to continue to accrue debt, largely without consequence.
**[As the current system compels nations to trade in US dollars,
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[has been free to run large budget deficits and balance of payments
deficits without any apparent impact on the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates (Hudson 2003, xii).
**[However, [if the]{.mark} US [dollar was to lose its position as
the]{.mark} global [reserve currency,]{.mark}
[the]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[would]{.mark} likely [experience a
major economic crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A critical problem may yet
emerge as the US issues more and more of its currency while trying to
maintain the value of the currency (Zhou 2009).

There is a continuing debate among scholars about the potential decline
of both the US dollar and US global hegemony, as well as the
implications of the ascendancy of China and cooperation between the
BRICS: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (Cox 2012). This
debate is broadly divided on the key issue of whether US hegemony is in
decline. The declinist view asserts that the rise of China and other
rival powers, in conjunction with the United States\' surging national
debt, budget deficits and over-extension of the US military, have placed
the United States in an economic position that cannot be sustained, one
which will ultimately affect the US dollar (Layne 2012; Ruppert 2004).
That outlook is contested by those who assert that, despite the
contemporary problems for US finances, there is at present neither a
single currency nor a basket of currencies that could be readily
substituted for the US dollar as the global reserve currency (Stokes
2014; Prasad 2014; Eichengreen 2011).

**[The]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[has been subjected to international political pressure regarding the
US dollar\'s global reserve status]{.underline}**. The Governor of the
Peoples Bank of **[China]{.underline}**, Zhou Xiaochuan, **[appealed in
2009 for a new global reserve currency]{.underline}**, disassociated
from any specific nation, arguing that stronger economic growth would be
fostered and the world economy would be stabilised (Anderlini 2009). The
former Russian President, Dmitry **[Medvedev]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}** the former Chinese President, **[Hu
Jintao]{.underline}**, have **[made similar demands]{.underline}**
(Capella 2014). **[However, without a majority of nations demanding a
new reserve currency, it appears unlikely that this political rhetoric
will affect the dollar-centric world economy]{.underline}**.

The establishment of the AIIB has been interpreted by some as a critical
challenge to US hegemony, and the US dollar as the global reserve, from
an increasingly powerful China. The AIIB will initially be capitalised
with \$50 billion, rising eventually to \$100 billion, and will be
critical to China\'s New Silk Road project (Donnan 2015). Strategically,
the New Silk Road project will draw into China\'s economic orbit the
countries of Central and South Asia. Through massive civil engineering
projects, the region will be incorporated into China\'s expanding
economic and security infrastructure (Escobar 2015). However, as
Chossudovsky (2015) has explained,

> **[While the creation of BRICS has significant geopolitical
> implications, [both the AIIB as well as]{.mark} the proposed
> [BRICS]{.mark} Development Bank]{.underline}** (NDB) **[and its
> Contingency Reserve Arrangement]{.underline}** (CRA) **[[are dollar
> denominated entities]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Unless they are
> coupled with a multi-currency system of trade and credit, they do not
> threaten dollar hegemony]{.underline}**. **[Quite the opposite,
> [they]{.mark}]{.underline}** tend to **[[sustain]{.mark} and extend
> [dollar]{.mark} denominated [lending]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
> (Chossudovsky 2015)

Despite these facts, the United States strongly opposed the formation of
the AIIB, and lobbied other nations against joining. Robert Kahn (2015)
of the CFR has argued that the founding of the AIIB reflects China\'s
displeasure at existing institutional arrangements in Asia, such as the
Asian Development Bank led by Japan, as well as the lack of reform at
the IMF. While the creation of the AIIB is an important development, it
is not an institution of the same magnitude or influence as, nor is it a
rival to, the IMF or the World Bank.

International trading arrangements that avoid using the US currency have
emerged as a potential, albeit limited, challenge to the status of the
US dollar as the global reserve currency. The invasion of Iraq,
according to W.R. Clark, was motivated by the neo-conservatives in the
Bush administration to stop Saddam Hussain from trading oil in Euros
(Clark 2005, 29). Similarly, Swanson calculates that military action was
taken against Col Gaddafi\'s government in 2011 under the pretext of
\"humanitarian intervention.\" However, it is noted that the Gaddafi
government was also preparing to move Libya\'s oil settlements away from
the dollar to a gold-backed currency (Swanson 2011). Several other
Middle Eastern states, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar, have
attempted to avoid the US dollar in oil trading, a move that could have
an impact upon the demand for US dollars and US Treasury bonds, as well
as long-standing financial and security agreements with the United
States (Fisk 2009). **[[Russia, China and Iran have sought to substitute
their own currencies]{.mark}, in place of the US dollar, in some
bilateral and multilateral trade arrangements]{.underline}**, in part to
mitigate the imposition of sanctions (Durden 2014).

In September 2015, the Russian government began drafting a bill that
would eliminate the US dollar from trade between the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS). This plan emerged in the context of continuing
political tensions between the United States and Russia in relation to
the Ukraine crisis. By avoiding the US dollar in regional trade,
President Vladimir **[Putin believed that [Russia would be less
susceptible to sanctions]{.mark} imposed by the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates (Russia Today 2015). President Putin ordered an
alternate payment system to be created, one which does not use the US
dollar (Pascali 2014).

Although not a direct challenge to the US dollar\'s global reserve
currency status, **[the substitution of other currencies for the dollar
in international trade could have an impact upon the US
economy]{.underline}**. Bilateral trade between Russia and China may be
increasingly important within the world economy of the future. Major
energy deals, such as the new China-Russia gas pipeline which will
supply Russian gas to China for the next 30 years, will not be traded in
US dollars (Pizzi 2014). **[This expanding bilateral energy trade
between China and Russia has the capacity to affect US financial
deficits; a potential decreased demand for dollars could
impact]{.underline}** US **[Treasury securities]{.underline}** (Koenig
2015). **[Recently, [Russia and China have been cooperating to develop
the CIPS]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The purpose of this system is to avoid
the Western-operated Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial
Telecommunication (SWIFT), a privately owned international payments
system used by over 10,000 financial institutions. Koenig (2016) argues,
\"**[[It would be a formidable alternative]{.mark} to the western dollar
based monetary Ponzi scheme]{.underline}**.\" **[The payment system will
be used by Brazil India Russian and China]{.underline}** (BRIC)
**[nations as well as Shanghai Cooperation]{.underline}** (SCO)
**[nations and has the potential to be a powerful alternative to a vital
US hegemonic system]{.underline}**.

**[The continuation of the dollar\'s position as the global reserve
currency is imperative for the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[and has been acknowledged as such in reports
by the]{.underline}** National Intelligence Council
(**[NIC]{.underline}**). A 2012 NIC report stated that, historically,
\"**[US dominance has been buttressed by the dollar\'s role as the
global reserve currency]{.underline}**\" (NIC 2012, 105). **[If the
dollar was abandoned as the global reserve currency, the NIC has stated
that it \"would be one of the sharpest indications of a loss of US
global economic position, strongly undermining Washington\'s political
influence]{.underline}** too\" (NIC 2012, xii). The NIC has speculated
that **[[the mere downgrading of the]{.mark} US dollar\'s [reserve
status]{.mark} \"[may force the US to consider]{.mark} more
[carefully]{.mark} how [the conduct of its foreign policy]{.mark}
affects the dollar\"]{.underline}** (NIC 2008, 12). As these reports
from the NIC indicate, **[the [retention of the dollar\'s]{.mark} global
reserve [status is vital to]{.mark} the future of
[the]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates**[[\']{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[economy, foreign policy and]{.mark} its [hegemonic power

If strategy is the calculated relation of means to ends, then today
**[America is careening toward strategic insolvency]{.underline}**.
Following the Cold War, the United States possessed unrivaled military
primacy, both globally and in all the world's key strategic theaters.
Yet today, **[Washington faces military challenges that are both more
severe and more numerous than at any time in decades]{.underline}**,
precisely as its own defense cutbacks have significantly reduced U.S.
military capabilities. **[[The]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[confronts]{.mark} challenges from [revisionist]{.mark} great
[powers]{.mark} such as China and Russia, [aggressive rogue states such
as Iran and North Korea, and]{.mark} international [terrorist
organizations]{.mark} such as al-Qaeda and the Islamic
State]{.underline}**. At the same time, **[constant-dollar defense
spending fell from \$768 billion in 2010 to \$595 billion in
2015]{.underline}**, the fastest drawdown---in percentage terms---since
the Korean War. **[The result has been a creeping crisis of American
military primacy, as the margin of superiority to which the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[has become accustomed
has diminished, and a growing gap between U.S. commitments and
capabilities has emerged]{.underline}**.

This state of **[[strategic insolvency]{.mark} poses numerous dangers to
both the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and the
broader international order that American grand strategy has
traditionally supported]{.underline}**. **[It [will undermine]{.mark}
U.S. [alliances]{.mark}, by [creating]{.mark} new [doubts
regarding]{.mark} the credibility of Washington's
[guarantees]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[It will [undercut
deterrence]{.mark}, by [tempting]{.mark} adversaries such as [Russia,
China, and Iran to calculate that the]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[may be]{.mark} unwilling---or [unable]{.mark}---[to oppose
aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[It will make for far harder fights
should conflict erupt in key areas from Europe to the Middle East to
East Asia, and it may ultimately result in a situation in which
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[simply cannot defend countries it has pledged to
defend]{.underline}**. The United States would currently face grave
difficulties defending the Baltic states from a Russian assault, for
instance; **[the military balance around Taiwan and]{.underline}**
elsewhere **[in East Asia has]{.underline}** also **[eroded
dramatically]{.underline}**. Finally, **[as U.S. military power becomes
less imposing, U.S. [diplomacy is likely to encounter greater
difficulties]{.mark} as well]{.underline}**. American officials
continually aver that the U.S. military is the finest fighting force in
the history of the world, but today, **[U.S. military power has become
dangerously insufficient relative to the grand strategy and
international order it has traditionally supported]{.underline}**.

Great powers facing strategic insolvency have three basic strategic
options. First, **[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[could decrease]{.mark} its global
[commitments]{.mark}]{.underline}**, thereby bringing its strategic
obligations back into alignment with a diminished military resource
base. In practice, this might mean dispensing with U.S. security
commitments to the most geographically exposed allies and
partners---such as Taiwan and the Baltic states---in hopes of
reconsolidating a more defensible strategic perimeter. **[Yet [the
appeal]{.mark} of this option [is]{.mark} largely [illusory]{.mark}, for
even [reducing]{.mark} defense [spending will not come close to
balancing the]{.mark} U.S. federal [budget absent major changes
in]{.mark} tax and [entitlement policies]{.mark}, and U.S.
[retrenchment]{.mark} from East Asia, the Middle East, or Eastern Europe
[is likely to generate profound geopolitical
instability]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Aggressive revisionist powers
may]{.mark} well [be emboldened]{.mark} by U.S. retreat; remaining U.S.
[allies]{.mark} may [lose confidence]{.mark} in the credibility of
American defense pledges]{.underline}**. **[Retrenchment may somewhat
narrow the gap between U.S. capabilities and commitments in the short
run, but only at the likely price of a further erosion of the global
order that U.S. strategy has been meant to defend]{.underline}**.

A second option is living with greater risk. In practice, this would
mean **[either [gambling that enemies will not test]{.mark} increasingly
[precarious commitments]{.mark} or employing riskier approaches---such
as [relying on nuclear weapons]{.mark} or other escalatory
strategies---to sustain those commitments]{.underline}**. This approach
has a certain intuitive appeal---it substitutes deterrence by punishment
for deterrence by denial---and the United States indeed relied on such
approaches during the Cold War. Yet it also entails profound
liabilities. Simply hoping that exposed commitments will not be
challenged could work for a time, but this approach **[[carries enormous
risk]{.mark} that those guarantees will eventually be tested and found
wanting, [with devastating effects]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Likewise,
**[more escalatory approaches to deterrence may lack credibility---if
America is not willing to bear the fiscal costs associated with making
its defense commitments credible through conventional means, would it
really risk the astronomically higher costs associated with nuclear
escalation in a conflict over Taiwan or the Baltic
states?]{.underline}** **[This approach thus risks [leading
the]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[into a trap where]{.mark}, if its
interests are challenged, it is confronted with a choice between
pursuing [escalatory options]{.mark} that [carry a prohibitive
price]{.mark} or simply acquiescing to aggression]{.underline}**.

[[America\'s global supremacy has been made

U.S. currency has [anchored the global financial system]{.underline}

#### US dollar collapse ends its status as the hegemon and causes China rise

**Off The Grid \'14** (Off the Grid is a news site dedicated to
reporting on the economy and current international state affairs
https://www.offthegridnews.com/financial/how-the-coming-dollar-collapse-will-leave-americans-destitute/)

An increasing number of **[financial experts are saying [the]{.mark}
United States [dollar is no longer a reliable]{.mark} and dependable
[currency]{.mark} -- and that its downfall is inevitable. There are even
some experts who [think](https://www.cnbc.com/id/101133131) the dollar
is so unstable that the Chinese Yuan will soon become the world's
reserve currency, or currency of choice.]{.underline}** "Our addictions
to debt and cheap money have finally caused our major international
creditors to call for an endto dollar hegemony and to push for a
'de-Americanized' world," investment advisor and financial strategist
Micheal Pento wrote in an op-ed piece for CNBC. Others agree. "In my
view **[the dollar is about to become [dethroned as the world's
defacto]{.mark} currency]{.underline}** basically," Canadian billionaire
investor Ned Goodman said. "We're headed to a period of stagflation,
maybe serious inflation, and the United States will be losing the
privilege of being able to print at its will the global reserve
currency." Goodman believes the US already is in another recession. The
unemployment numbers are understated and the "real" unemployment number
likely is closer to 15 percent, he said. Over half of 200 international
institutional investors surveyed by the Economist think that the Yuan
will eventually replace the dollar as the world's reserve currency. The
reserve currency is the money most commonly accepted for international
trade. Why Reserve Currencies Matter Having money with a reserve
currency status enables a nation to dominate and control the world's
financial markets, as their currency is used for international trade and
transactions. The US has the ability to maintain a \$17 trillion
national debt largely because the dollar is the reserve currency. **[[A
nation with a reserve currency can]{.mark} simply [print money to pay
its debts]{.mark}. In past centuries [nations]{.mark}]{.underline}**
such as Britain, France, Spain, the Netherlands, and Portugal **[[lost
their status as super powers]{.mark} in part [when their money lost
reserve currency status]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Reserve currencies
collapse because people no longer trust or believe in the governments
that issue them. Goodman says that the US dollar became the reserve
currency in the 1970s because Saudi Arabia agreed to only accept only
the dollar as payment for oil. Goodman noted that at least one major
producer, Russia, is now accepting Yuan in payment for oil. Goodman was
referring to a deal that Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian leader
Vladimir Putin made last May. Under the terms of deal, **[[Russian
companies]{.mark} can [borrow money directly from China in exchange for
oil]{.mark}. The US dollar once was backed by gold and silver, Goodman
said, but now is "backed by nothing." [Australia Starts Using
Yuan]{.mark}]{.underline}** One of America's oldest and closest allies
may have taken the first step to ending the dollar's reign as the
reserve currency. CNBC reported that the Yuan will now be traded in
Australia's financial markets. Among other things that will let Chinese
customers pay Australian firms in Yuan. China is the biggest market for
Australia's exports such as iron and coal. Story continues below video
The Australian government has endorsed the deal because China is
Australia's biggest trading partner. Arthur Sinodinos, Australia's
Assistant Treasurer (treasury secretary) even went on CNBC's Asia Squawk
Box show to endorse the deal. **["[It's a big vote of confidence by both
countries]{.mark} in the future of the relationship,"]{.underline}**
Sinodinos said. Not even recent economic problems in China seemed to
dampen Sinodinos' enthusiasm for the arrangement. "There's no doubt that
the **[[Chinese authorities are having to manage issues in the financial
sector to make sure that growth is sustained]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but
they've shown great skill at that in the past **[they were very [adept
at the fallout from the]{.mark} global [financial
crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}**," Sinodinos said. In other words,
Sinokinos believes the Chinese are doing a very good job of managing
their economy and their currency is reliable. How will the Dethroning of
the Dollar Affect You? Observers disagree widely on how **[the [end of
the dollar's reign as reserve currency would affect the US
economy]{.mark} and average Americans]{.underline}**. Retired
neurosurgeon and pundit Dr. Ben Carson thinks **[it would [turn the US
into a third world nation and lead to]{.mark} unrest that would lead to
[martial law]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as Off The Grid News recently
reported. Goodman believes there will soon be a massive sell off of US
dollars that will lead to inflation. He also suggested a way for people
to protect their assets. "**[The Chinese have three and a half trillion
US dollars and they're spending these dollars as quickly as they
can,]{.underline}** and it will not be long before the rest of the world
and the US will be thinking likewise. I do." Goodman said. In the 1930s,
everyone wanted US dollars, he said, but today they're trying to get rid
of them. He thinks that many investors are trying to spend all of their
dollars to buy hard assets in order to avoid losing money invested in
dollars. That means average people might be able to protect themselves
by investing in hard assets such as gold, real estate or silver, Goodman
said.

**[[The dollar collapse will be the]{.mark} single [largest event

event that will touch every single living person in the world. All human
activity is controlled by money. **[Our [wealth]{.mark}, our
[work]{.mark}, our [food]{.mark}, our [government]{.mark}, even our
relationships are affected by money. [No money in human history has had
as much reach in both breadth and depth as the
dollar]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It is the de facto world currency. All
other currency collapses will pale in comparison to this big one. All
other **[[currency crises have been regional]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
there were other currencies for people to grasp on to. This collapse
will be global and it will bring down not only the dollar but all other
fiat currencies, as they are fundamentally no different. **[[The
collapse of currencies will lead to the collapse of ALL paper
assets]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The repercussions to this will have
incredible results worldwide. (Read the Silver Bullet and the Silver
Shield to protect yourself from this collapse.) Thanks to the
globalization and the giant vampire squids of the Anglo-American Empire,
**[[the dollar is the world\'s reserve currency]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
It supports the global economy in settling foreign trade, most
importantly the Petro Dollar trade. This money is recycled through the
City of London (not to be confused with London) and New York. This fuels
our corporate vampires that acquires and harvests the wealth of the
world. The corporate powers suppress REAL assets like natural resources
and labor to provide themselves massive profits. **[This Fascist,
Statist, Collectivist model provides the money into the economy to fund
an ever increasing federal government.]{.underline}** That government
then grows larger and larger enriching its minions with jobs to control
their fellow citizens. Finally, to come full circle, the government then
controls other nations through the Military Industrial Complex. **[[This
cycle will be cut when the]{.mark} mathematically and inevitable
[collapse of the dollar occurs.]{.mark} In order for our debt based
money to function we MUST increase the debt every year in excess of the
debt]{.underline}** AND interest accrued the year before or we will
enter a deflationary death spiral. When debt is created, money is
created. When debt is paid off, money is destroyed. There is never
enough to pay off the debt, because there would be not one dollar in
existence. We are at a point where we either default on the
debt,willingly or unwillingly,or create more money/debt to keep the
cycle moving. The problem is, if you understand anything about
compounding interest, we are reaching the hockey stick moment where the
more debt that is incurred,the less effective it is and this leads us to
hyper inflation. There are only two actors needed for this hyper
inflation, the Lender of Last Resort, the Fed, and the Spender of Last
Resort, the government. These two can and will blow up the system. I
believe they will wait until the next crisis and the whiff of
deflationary depression before they fire up the printing presses. That
crisis is coming very soon at the end of this summer or fall. The money
and emergency measures are worn out. The fact that NONE of the
underlying problems that caused the 2008 crisis have been resolved. The
only thing that has happened is that instead of corporate problems,we
now have nation problems. In this movie Greece will play the role of
Lehman Brothers and the United States will play the role of AIG. The
problem is there is nowhere to kick the can down the road and there is
no world government to absorb the
debt,yet...(Problem,Reaction,Solution.) So this leads me to the Top 5
Places Not To Be When the Dollar Collapses. 1**[. [Israel]{.mark}- This
Anglo-American beach head into the Middle East was first conceived by
the most powerful family in the world, the Rothschilds, in
1917.]{.underline}** The Balfour Declaration said that there will be a
Zionist Israel years before World War two and the eventual establishment
of Israel. Israel has not been a good neighbor to its Muslim nations and
has always had the two biggest bullies on the block at it\'s back.
**[When the dollar collapses, [the United States will have too much on
its plate]{.mark} both domestically and internationally [to worry about
such a non-strategic piece of land.]{.mark} This]{.underline}** will
leave Israel very weak at a time when tensions will be high. This very
thin strip of desert land will **[[not be able to with stand the
economic]{.mark} reality of importing its food and fuel [or the
political reality of being surrounded]{.mark} by Muslims.]{.underline}**
2. **[[So]{.mark}uthern [Cal]{.mark}ifornia-]{.underline}** The land of
Fruits and Nuts **[[turns into Battlefield Los Angeles]{.mark}. 20
million people packed into an area that has no water and thus food is
not good to say the least.]{.underline}** Throw on top of the huge
wealth disparities and the proximity to a narco state and this does not
bode well. **[We have seen riots for Rodney King, [what will happen when
the dollar is destroyed and food an fuel stop coming into this
area]{.mark}.]{.underline}** People will get desperate and do crazy
things, especially when a huge proportion of its citizens are on anti
depressants. If food and fuel cannot get in, what about Zoloft? At a
time when people\'s world are falling apart they lack the ability to
deal with this new paradigm. If people come off of these drugs too fast
they suffer psychotic breaks and you will have thousands of shootings or
suicides. 3. **[[England]{.underline}]{.mark}**- The Land of the Big
Brother and **[former Empire of world wide slave and drug trade [will
suffer heavily]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The stiff upper lip that their
the British Elite ingrained into their sheeple will not work anymore as
the British population explodes. **[[The human character will
sacrifice]{.mark} and unite [for a foreign enemy]{.mark},but not if the
enemy has always been the Elite]{.underline}**. The Anglo-American
Empire may **[pull off another [false
flag](http://dont-tread-on.me/the-3-coming-false-flags/) to distract
it\'s population]{.underline}** on another Emmanuel Goldstein like in
1984, but I feel this collapse will happen before they pull it off. This
will make all eyes point at the British Elite as solely responsible for
this catastrophe. We have seen massive riots for soccer matches with
hooligans. What will happen when this island with very little food and
fuel gets cut off? 4. New York City- Another large urban area living too
high on the dollar hog. NYC is the area I moved out of in 2008. **[There
is little doubt that all of the [wealth in New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut is derivative off of Wall Street]{.mark}
wealth.]{.underline}** The savings and investments of the whole nation
and much of the world flows through this financial capital. **[As the
world wakes up to the massive financial fraud, this will lead to the
[destruction of capital]{.mark} like we have never seen
before.]{.underline}** This will have tremendous effects on the regional
economy as people driving in Mercedes suddenly wonder where their next
meal is coming from. 5. Washington D.C.- **[[The political collapse of
the Federal Government will wreck havoc]{.mark} on the hugely
[inflated]{.mark} local [economy]{.mark}. As more and more states find
it necessary to assert their natural control, the Federal Government
will suddenly loose power]{.underline}** and importance as the whole
world suffers from a Global Hurricane Katrina. **[The [money]{.mark}
that they create and spend, [will become worthless]{.mark} and the
government minions pensions will evaporate.]{.underline}** Millions that
once relied on the ability to force others to send their money to
them,will learn that the real power has always been at the most local
level. Massive decentralization will be the answer to globalization gone
mad. Local families and communities will forgo sending money and power
out of their community, as they will care about their next meal and
keeping warm. \"**[[You can ignore reality, but you can\'t ignore the
consequences of ignoring reality]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\" -Ayn Rand
**[To sum up, those areas that have lived highest on the hog in the
dollar paradigm will most likely be the worst places to live when the
dollar collapses.]{.underline}** Many of you will find this article with
passing interest, but rest assured this dollar collapse is coming. It is
a mathematical inevitability. We will not be as fortunate to muddle
through this collapse like we did in 2008 when it was a corporate
problem. This time around, it is a national and global problem. The
global Ponzi scheme has run out of gas as the demographics decline, as
cheap abundant oil declines, as hegemonic power declines. This comes at
a time when we reach the exponential or collapse phase of our money. The
Irresistible Force Paradox says, \"What happens when an unstoppable
force meets an immovable object?\" We are about to find out, when
infinite money hits a very finite world.

**[Because [the US is a]{.mark} very [powerful economy]{.mark} and [the
dollar is the main international reserve currency, it has not been hard
to finance]{.mark} its [shortfalls]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But how far
can the US increase its debt without losing the confidence of the
market? No theory determines the cap of a country's public
debt---**[[it]{.mark} basically [depends on the degree of
confidence]{.mark} in the currency. In the European Union, for example,
its member countries should not exceed public debt of 60 per cent of
GDP]{.underline}** but some surpass it substantially.

For the near future, important financial institutions foresee a new
economic recession. If it happens, how would it affect the US economy
and the dollar? Could it have difficulties with its current high debt?
**[Could [the American debt be in default]{.mark}]{.underline}**?
Technically this cannot be and politically it's unthinkable: **[the US
can always issue more dollars to pay off debts.]{.underline}**

**[This situation [would not]{.mark} however [prevent loss of creditors'
trust and]{.mark} probably a [downward spiral from the deficit]{.mark}
to the issue of dollars]{.underline}**, to higher interest rates, to
more debt and so more deficit. If this were to happen, it would engender
an immense psychological shock for the American population and for the
world as well.

Central banks are far from having recovered the normalcy which prevailed
before the 2007 crisis. If a new crisis arises, they will not be able to
supply as much money and keep lowering the interest rate as they did.

**[[In a world that has become multipolar]{.mark}, it is likely that
[the dollar will progressively cease to enjoy hegemony]{.mark} as the
international reserve currency and the main currency for commercial
transactions---and it will keep losing value.]{.underline}** Consider
that to have the same purchasing power of 100 dollars in 1913 would
require 2,000 dollars today. Inflation and the continued issue of
dollars are the two main reasons for this eroded value.

It's not aircraft carriers and nuclear missiles that make the U.S. one
of the most feared countries in the world. It's our currency. And
**[[this country has a]{.mark} long [history of weaponzing]{.mark} [the
dollar]{.mark}]{.underline}** in an effort to make its enemies crumble.
But **[[this]{.mark} practice [is about to
backfire]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Because **[if you threaten folks long
enough and screw with their money, they'll eventually strike
back]{.underline}**. And there is mounting evidence that this is what's
happening right now. **[[The U.S. dollar is the foundation on]{.mark}
which the United States has built its [superpower status]{.mark}. And
this nation has never been afraid of wielding this power to call the
shots on an international stage. We've used it countless times to bring
our adversaries to their knees.]{.underline}** And we've continued to
use it even more aggressively over the past 20 years. But **[[this trend
is starting to put the U.S. at risk of losing
everything]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as other nations are now starting to
join forces to strip the U.S. of its power by seeking alternatives to
the U.S. dollar. If such a thing were to happen on a large scale, the
U.S. would lose much of its power --- and wealth. Analyst Patrick
Lawrence opined on this very issue and really hit the nail on the head
when he noted that as the U.S. continues to weaponize the dollar, it is
prompting many other nations to find alternatives to the U.S. currency
as the default medium of exchange. Here's more: The impulse to
de-dollarize international trade and financial transactions has been
evident for some time. **[[Russia]{.mark} has actively
[encouraged]{.mark} its [trading partners to avoid the dollar]{.mark} in
favor of local currencies]{.underline}** since Washington imposed
sanctions against Russia following the U.S.--cultivated coup in Ukraine
five years ago. Russia is now recruiting other nations to participate in
its alternative to the U.S.--controlled SWIFT bank-messaging system**[.
[China]{.mark} has [set up a parallel mechanism]{.mark}, the
Cross­--Border Interbank Payments System.]{.underline}** **[China
[launched an oil-futures market denominated in yuan]{.mark} little more
than a year ago]{.underline}**. Its annual turnover is already the
equivalent of \$2.5 trillion. The Shanghai Futures Exchange, where oil
futures are traded, recently announced plans to offer forward contracts
in rubber, nonferrous metals, and other commodities --- all to be
transacted in yuan. The G--20 gathering marked an important step for
these de-dollarization efforts. France, Germany, and Britain announced
on the opening day that a trading system developed over the past year to
circumvent U.S. sanctions against Iran --- and any entity transacting
with it --- is now operational. I know there are plenty of folks who
love to chant U-S-A\... U-S-A\... U-S-A\... But the reality is that
**[the U.S. is a bully nation that many other countries would love to
see taken down a few notches. This, by the way, is not an anti-American
comment. It's simply an observation of truth.]{.underline}** And here's
another truth that's likely to piss a lot of people off\... **[[While
plenty of]{.mark} other [countries]{.mark} are actively [seek]{.mark}ing
[to derail the dollar as the default medium]{.mark} of exchange, [we

health of our economy]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### Even if the dollar is strong now, the plan triggers a switch to alternate currencies and decks US leadership

**Tappe 7-12-19** (Anneken Tappe is a financial journalist based in New
York, New York. She is a markets reporter at MarketWatch. \[1\] \[2\]
https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/12/investing/dollar-big-mac-index/index.html)

New York (CNN Business)**[The [US]{.mark} dollar\'s [share of global
reserves is falling]{.mark}, while [the euro and Chinese yuan are
becoming more popular]{.mark}. Is the [dollar\'s reign coming to an
end]{.mark}]{.underline}**? Not so fast. Although the United States\'
trade policies are part of the reason central banks around the globe
looking to diversify their currency holdings, the dollar remains the
world\'s reserve currency for a reason: Everyone trades it, the American
economy is strong, and it is backed by the full faith and credit of the
the US Treasury. Last year, **[the [dollar\'s share of global reserves
dropped]{.mark} to [below 62%]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} according
to a report by the European Central Bank reviewing the international
role of currencies and the euro. That\'s the lowest level since the
start of the Economic and Monetary Union, which was in 1992. **[The
dollar\'s share is now more than seven percentage points lower than it
was before the financial crisis.]{.underline}** But **[[the total
amount]{.mark} of dollars held in the world actually [went up]{.mark}
last year.]{.underline}** \"There have been some movements in reserves,
but dollar holdings have never been larger,\" because total reserves in
the world have grown, said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at
Bannockburn Global Forex. Central banks and similar institutions hold
dollars, often in form of US Treasuries, as backup funds in case of a
crisis event \-- and also to facilitate international payments. Other
currencies like the euro and, more recently, the Chinese yuan are used
to diversify so not all central bank eggs are in one dollar-denominated
basket. The share of yuan reserves reached almost 2% last year, nearly
double compared with early 2017. The euro is the second most popular
reserve with a global share just under 21%, notwithstanding today\'s
drop in the currency after ECB President Mario Draghi hinted at a path
for more monetary stimulus in for the eurozone. Politics are likely
playing are role in these movements, with ongoing trade spats between
the United States and its partners. Both politics and market volatility
can be blamed for the dollar\'s loss of market share last year. **[Some
[central banks actively diversified their reserves]{.mark} to move away
from the dominant dollar because of actions by the United
States.]{.underline}** \"One example is **[[Russia]{.mark}, one of the
world\'s largest reserve holders, which [sold]{.mark} about \$[100
billion]{.mark} worth of US dollar-denominated reserves]{.underline}**
in the wake of new rounds of US sanctions, and purchased almost \$90
billion worth of euro-denominated and renminbi \[Chinese
yuan\]-denominated assets in the second quarter of 2018,\" the ECB
report said. **[[China]{.mark} also [reduced its]{.mark} US [Treasury
holdings \"to]{.mark} the tune of [about \$60
billion]{.mark}\"]{.underline}** over the course of last year amid the
escalating trade war, according to the report. But one fundamental
problem for central banks is choosing an alternative to the greenback
that is similar in liquidity and market depth, said Neil Mellor, chief
currency strategist at BNY Mellon. That is to say, while it\'s a fine
concept to want to diversify from US holdings to a smaller country\'s
government bonds, that market might not be sophisticated or large enough
to make sense for this kind of investment. **[Another reason the
dollar\'s share got knocked last year is that emerging
markets]{.underline}**, such as Turkey and Argentina, **[sold a lot of
their foreign reserves to stabilize their own currencies]{.underline}**.
As the Federal Reserve was raising interest rates at the time, the
dollar strengthened, which caused pain for emerging markets, many of
which have dollar-denominated debt. Between March and September 2018,
emerging markets central banks sold some \$200 billion in foreign
exchange reserves, according to the ECB report. The dollar\'s share of
global reserves might well continue to decline going forward even as
overall reserves increase. But so far, it doesn\'t look like the dollar
will lose its status as No. 1 anytime soon. \"It\'s too early to tell if
this is the beginning of the end of the dollar as the king reserve
currency,\" said Chandler, the Bannockburn market strategist. **[\"If
the dollar share is going down because people have lost confidence \[in
the United States\] due to repeated recessions and financial crisis,
that\'s one thing.]{.underline}** But if it is about straight
diversification, that is not in and of itself a bad thing.\"

#### Losing dollar heg would severely hurt US geopolitical strategies

**NA 4/6**/19 \" Even Saudi Arabia Threatens To Ditch Dollar For Oil
Trade Over US Bullying Policies.\"
https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/Even-Saudi-Arabia-Threatens-to-Ditch-Dollar-for-Oil-Trade-Over-US-Bullying-Policies-20190406-0011.html

[[Saudi Arabia threatens to sell oil in currencies other than the
dollar]{.mark}]{.underline} if Washington passes a bill exposing the
[Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC)](https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/Opec-May-Need-to-Extend-Oil-Cuts-Until-the-End-of-2019-20190317-0018.html)
to U.S. antitrust lawsuits. The No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels
Act (NOPEC), which was introduced by Democrat Senator Herb Kohl in 2000
and received backing from [Donald
Trump](https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/Trump-Pulls-Back-from-Threat-to-Shut-Down-Mexican-Border-20190404-0019.html)
in 2011, has never been approved and has little chance of being passed.
This legislative proposal aims to allow OPEC oil companies to be sued
under the U.S. antitrust law for their attempts to set international
prices by limiting oil supplies, a practice which has been regularly
applied as a way of stabilizing the global market. The Saudi Arabian
threat makes visible a growing discontent over the way the U.S. treats
OPEC countries. According to Reuters, senior Saudi energy officials have
been analyzing the ditching-dollar-oil-trades possibility for several
months and would have already mentioned reported it to U.S. officials.
In the unlikely event that Saudi Arabia were to adopt this new policy,
[[it would undermine the dollar status as an international reserve
currency, which could weaken in turn the U.S. ability to enforce
economic sanctions on nation states]{.underline}]{.mark}. \"The Saudis
know they have the dollar as nuclear option\" and if Washington and
Trump \"let the NOPEC pass \... [it would be the U.S. economy that would
fall apart,]{.underline}\" the source added in comments to Reuters.
Russia, China and some European countries have been calling for reducing
the dollar's influence in international trade. If this happens, the U.S.
would lose a significant part of its ability to control both the world
economy and its own growth. Due to President Trump's aggressive foreign
policy, however, Russia, Venezuela and Iran, all of which are being
placed under harsh U.s. economic sanctions have been selling their oil
in Euros, Yuans or other traditional or virtual currencies. Non-dollar
oil contracts are concrete challenges to the U.S. hegemony at the oil
market. [[If Saudi Arabia makes a mov]{.mark}e in that sense, [it would
also mean a heavy blow to the U.S. geopolitical
strategies]{.mark}.]{.underline} Saudi Arabia, which controls a 10th of
global production, made oil deals for US\$356 billion in 2018, which
made it the world\'s biggest oil exporter. At a price of US\$70 per
barrel, the global oil output is estimated to be about US\$2.5 trillion.
At least 60 percent of this amount is now being traded in dollars. In
addition, oil futures and options trading reached a nominal value of
US\$5 trillion in 2018, as reported by Reuters.

#### The petrodollar collapse would get rid of the geopolitical leverage

**Paul 16** Ron Paul is The leading spokesman in Washington for limited
constitutional government, low taxes, free markets, and a return to
sound monetary policies based on commodity-backed currency. \"Collapse
of the Petro-Dollar\"
https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-news/petro-dollar-012820161

In essence, [the Petro-Dollar system was an agreement that the US would
guarantee the survival of the House of Saud. In]{.underline} exchange,
Saudi Arabia would: Use its dominant position in Opec to ensure that all
oil transactions would happen in US Dollars; Invest a large amount of
its Dollars from oil revenue in US Treasury securities and use the
interest payments from those securities to pay US companies to modernize
the infrastructure of Saudi Arabia; Guarantee the price of oil within
limits acceptable to the US and prevent another oil embargo by other
Opec members; Oil is the world\'s most traded and most strategic
commodity. Needing to use Dollars for oil transactions is a very
compelling reason for foreign countries to keep large US Dollar
reserves. For example, if Italy wants to buy oil from Kuwait, it has to
purchase US Dollars on the foreign exchange market to pay for the oil
first. This creates an artificial market for US Dollars that would not
otherwise exist. The demand is artificial because the US Dollar is just
a middleman in a transaction that has nothing to do with a US product or
service. Ultimately, it translates into increased purchasing power and a
deeper, more liquid market for the US Dollar and US Treasuries.
Additionally, the US has the unique privilege of not having to use
foreign currency to buy imports, including oil. Instead, it gets to use
its own currency, which it can print. It\'s hard to overstate how much
the Petro-Dollar system benefits the US Dollar. It\'s allowed the US
government and many Americans to live beyond their means for decades.
The geopolitical sands of the Middle East are rapidly shifting. Saudi
Arabia\'s strategic regional position is weakening. Iran, which is
notably not part of the Petro-Dollar system, is on the rise. US military
interventions are failing. And the emerging BRICS countries are creating
potential alternatives to US-dominated economic/security arrangements.
This all affects the sustainability of the Petro-Dollar system. The
Saudis are furious because they don\'t think the US is holding up its
end of the Petro-Dollar deal by more aggressively attacking their
regional rivals. This suggests that they might not uphold their part of
the deal much longer, namely selling their oil exclusively in US
Dollars[. **[The Saudis have even suggested a \"major shift\" is under
way in their relationship with the US]{.mark}**]{.underline} To date,
though, they haven\'t matched their words with action, so it may just be
a temper tantrum or a bluff. The Saudis need an outside protector. So
far, they haven\'t found any suitable replacements for the US In any
case, they\'re using truly unprecedented language. This situation may
reach a turning point when US officials start expounding on the need to
transform the monarchy in Saudi Arabia into a \"democracy.\" But don\'t
count on that happening as long as Saudi oil sells exclusively for US
Dollars. Regardless, the chances that the Kingdom might implode on its
own are growing. For the first time in decades, observers are calling
into question the viability of the Saudi currency, the Riyal. The Saudi
central bank currently pegs the Riyal at a rate of 3.75 Riyals per US
Dollar. The Saudi government spends a ton of money on welfare to keep
its citizens sedated. Lower oil prices plus the cost of their mischief
in the region are cutting deep into government revenue. So there\'s less
money to spend on welfare. There\'s a serious crunch in the Saudi
budget. They\'ve only been able to stay afloat by draining their foreign
exchange reserves. That threatens their currency peg. Recently, Saudi
officials have begun telling the media that the currency peg is fine and
there\'s nothing to worry about. **[[That\'s another clue that there\'s
trouble]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Official government denial is almost
always a sign of the opposite. It\'s like the old saying: \"Believe
nothing until it has been officially denied.\" If there were a
convenient way to short the Saudi Riyal, I would do it in a heartbeat.
Long before Nixon ended the Bretton Woods system in 1971, it was clear
that a paradigm shift in the global monetary system was inevitable.
Today, another paradigm shift seems inevitable. As Ron Paul explained,
there\'s one sure way to know when that shift is imminent: We will know
that day is approaching when oil-producing countries demand gold, or its
equivalent, for their oil rather than Dollars or Euros. It\'s very
possible that, one day soon, Americans will wake up to a new reality,
just as they did in 1971 when Nixon severed the Dollar\'s final link to
gold. **[[The Petro-Dollar system has allowed the US government and many
US citizens to live way beyond their means for decades. It also gives
the US unchecked geopolitical leverage.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The US
can exclude virtually any country from the US Dollar-based financial
system\...and, by extension, from the vast majority of international
trade. The US takes this unique position for granted. But it will
disappear once the Dollar loses its premier status. This will likely be
the tipping point\... Afterward, the US government will be desperate
enough to implement capital controls, people controls, nationalization
of retirement savings, and other forms of wealth confiscation. I urge
you to prepare for the economic and sociopolitical fallout while you
still can. Expect bigger government, less freedom, shrinking
prosperity\...and possibly worse. It\'s probably not going to happen
tomorrow. But it\'s clear where the trend is headed. Once the
Petro-Dollar system kicks the bucket and the Dollar loses its status as
the world\'s premier reserve currency, you will have few, if any,
options to protect yourself. This is why it\'s essential to act before
that happens. The sad truth is, most people have no idea how bad things
could get, let alone how to prepare.

[[In]{.underline}]{.mark} many ways, this was an accurate reflection of
the national mood at the end of [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
19[[70s]{.underline}]{.mark}. During that decade, [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [faced a raft of
serious **challenges --- severe economic competition**]{.underline} from
other leading powers, **[the rise of the Soviet Union]{.underline}** as
a global peer competitor in military terms, the **[stagflation
and]{.underline}** national humiliation caused by the **[oil
shocks]{.underline}**. [[There were concerns]{.mark} that [the
**U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[was
turning **inward**]{.mark} **in the wake** of Vietnam, as leading
congressional observers even sought to withdraw significant numbers of
U.S. troops from Europe]{.underline}. **[Economic nationalism was on the
rise]{.underline}**. Richard Nixon's first treasury secretary, John
Connally, artfully expressed the ethos: "Foreigners are out to screw us.
Our job is to screw them first."

In these circumstances, [doubts about the staying power of
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and the
postwar international system were pervasive]{.underline}. [Defenders of
that system fretted that the American era was coming to a
close;]{.underline} enemies of the free world were often exultant. "The
retreat of American power" could "become a rout," James Schlesinger, the
former secretary of defense and secretary of energy, wrote in 1979. "The
trend could well become irreversible in many respects." "Imperialism is
not able to face the crises," Leonid Brezhnev had told Warsaw Pact
leaders the year prior.

**[And [yet the]{.mark} 19[70s proved not]{.mark} to be [the death knell
for American power]{.mark} and the free world system]{.underline}**
erected after World War II, [but simply a difficult moment that served
as prelude to renewal]{.underline}. [By the late 1970s, the world was
again turning in America's direction --- democracy was spreading,
globalization was racing ahead, America's primary great-power competitor
was sliding into irreversible decline]{.underline}. And by the early
1980s the United States was pursuing assertive and broadly effective
strategies for re-establishing its global ascendancy and pushing the
positive trends along. Within a decade, the Cold War had ended on
American terms, as democracy and markets were advancing --- with U.S.
assistance --- further than ever before.

If focusing on the 1930s analogy thus leads one to fear that the end of
the international order is nigh, **[looking at the 1970s encourages the
conclusion that perhaps the future is relatively bright after
all]{.underline}**. In this view, **[the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and the
international system it anchors still have tremendous and unmatched
strengths vis-à-vis the competition, the long-term trends are working in
Washington's favor]{.underline}**, and [[America is]{.mark} simply
[experiencing]{.mark} one of its [**periodic moments** of doubt]{.mark}
and introspection [rather than a]{.mark} more **[fundamental
turn]{.mark}** away [from internationalism]{.mark}]{.underline} --- just
as occurred during the 1970s.

So how well does this analogy fit? In some ways, emphasizing the 1970s
comparison risks understating the difficulties and challenges America
faces today. For all the disillusion occasioned by Vietnam, America did
not elect a president who repudiated key traditions of U.S. foreign
policy as vehemently and frequently as Donald Trump did during the 2016
campaign. American "soft power" took a beating amid the domestic
upheaval of the 1970s, but that weakness may ultimately prove to be
minor compared with the loss of prestige the United States is already
suffering as a result of Trump's presidency.

From a global perspective, the Soviet Union may have been an authentic
military peer rival during the 1970s, but even at its peak its
sclerotic, command economy never threatened U.S. economic primacy as
China does today. And in the 1970s, the United States was able deftly to
play China and the Soviet Union against each other; today, Washington
has fraught and deteriorating relations with both powers as they
challenge international norms and geopolitical arrangements to which
they were never genuinely reconciled. The 1970s were a difficult period,
no doubt, but the comparison may --- at least in some ways --- encourage
too rosy a view of what America confronts today.

Yet if the 1970s are far from the perfect analogy, the period does
nonetheless illuminate important aspects of the contemporary moment. It
reminds us that, today as in the past, America's competitors face
long-term challenges that make ours look relatively modest by
comparison. Russia is, after all, a declining economic power and a
demographic basket case; its military power thus rests on extremely
precarious foundations. China is already dealing with slowing economic
growth, a rapidly aging population, and a massive debt bubble, and its
sense of geopolitical self-confidence hardly conceals its leadership's
transparent nervousness about growing social unrest and other signs of
dissatisfaction with a corrupt and ruthlessly authoritarian political
system.

Similarly, [the 1970s analogy reminds us to [take into account
**long-range**]{.mark} **U.S. [strengths]{.mark}** that no adversary can
match and to factor in emerging trends that may play to America's
advantage.]{.underline} [Washington's]{.underline} unequaled collection
of allies, its relatively healthy demographic profile, its culture of
innovation, and its repeated resilience in the face of macroeconomic
shifts falls into the first category; an energy revolution that is
giving America new [[economic]{.mark} and geopolitical [leverage
is]{.mark} but [one example]{.mark}]{.underline} of the
second[.]{.underline}

Moreover, the experience of the 1970s underscores that assertive
challengers often overplay their hand, thereby risking overreach and
exposing vulnerabilities for the United States and its allies to
exploit. An overconfident Moscow took on numerous Third World
commitments during the 1970s, allowing Carter and then Reagan to punish
that overextension through support to anti-communist guerrillas. Should
Russia and China continue their revisionist behavior today, they are
similarly likely to encourage geopolitical blowback, if only by driving
their rivals toward closer cooperation with one another and with the
United States. Additionally, [we can learn from the 1970s that our
current traumas are neither unprecedented nor particularly severe by
historical standards]{.underline}. [In its effects on U.S. political
stability and American power]{.underline}, the [Vietnam]{.underline} War
[was far worse than anything the country has experienced in Iraq or
Afghanistan]{.underline} over the past 15 years[.]{.underline}

Finally, [the experience of the 1970s also cautions us not to panic
about the state of American internationalism]{.underline}. [Yes, the
[Trump]{.mark} phenomenon [is]{.mark} **deeply [disturbing]{.mark}** for
those who wish to see a globally engaged America contributing
constructively on issues including international trade and combating
climate change]{.underline}. [[But we]{.mark} have [**lived through**
periods of]{.mark} American [disillusion]{.mark} with the world
[before]{.mark}, as the experience of the 1970s reminds us, and the
logic of [global engagement]{.mark} and activism has generally
**[reasserted itself]{.mark}** after a fashion]{.underline} --- [usually
in response to threatening developments abroad. Indeed, the fact that
public opinion polling on support for U.S. alliances and honoring
America's overseas commitments actually looked much worse in the
mid-1970s than it does at present]{.underline} (after the U.S.
withdrawal from Vietnam, for instance, only 36 percent of Americans felt
that "it was important for the United States to make and keep
commitments to other nations") [provides some antidote to pessimism
today]{.underline}.

## AT Warming Turn

### AT I/L - Generic

#### Emissions of fossil fuels have nothing to do with global warming

**Happer 09** (William Happer- the Cyrus Fogg Bracket Professor of
Physics at Princeton University, "Global warming not related to fossil
fuel combustion",
http://blogs.edf.org/climate411/2009/03/13/global-warming-normal-nothing-to-do-with-fossil-fuels/)

The current warming period began about 1800 at the end of the little ice
age, long before there was an appreciable increase of CO2. There have
been similar and even larger warmings several times in the 10,000 years
since the end of the last ice age. [[These]{.mark} earlier
[warmings]{.mark} clearly [had nothing to do with the combustion of
fossil fuels.]{.mark} The [current warming also seems to be due]{.mark}
mostly [to natural causes, not to increasing levels of carbon
dioxide]{.mark}. Over the past ten years there has been no global
warming, and in fact a slight cooling. This is not at all what was
predicted by the IPCC models.]{.underline}

### AT I/L - Methane Key

#### Methane is the real cause to global warming

**Harris 10** (Richard Harris - Award-winning journalist Richard Harris
has reported on a wide range of topics in science, medicine and the
environment since he joined NPR in 1986. In early 2014, his focus
shifted from an emphasis on climate change and the environment to
biomedical research, "Methane Causes Vicious Cycle In Global Warming",
https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122638800)

[Methane]{.underline} gas comes from all sorts of sources including
wetlands, rice paddies, cow tummies, coal mines, garbage dumps and even
termites. Drew Shindell, at NASA\'s Goddard Institute in New York, says,
\"It\'s [gone up by 150 percent since the pre-industrial period. So
that\'s an enormous increase. CO2, by contrast, has gone up by something
like 30 percent.]{.underline}\" More From This Series New Anti-Smog
Restrictions Could Warm Planet Jan. 25, 2010 Molecule for molecule,
[[methane is]{.mark} much [more effective than carbon dioxide at
trapping heat in the atmosphere]{.mark}.]{.underline} And that\'s just
part of the trouble. \"[[Methane]{.mark} is much more complicated once
it gets into the atmosphere than something like carbon dioxide
is]{.underline},\" Shindell says, \"and that\'s because it reacts with a
lot of different important chemicals.\" For example[, methane in the
atmosphere also [creates ground-level ozone]{.mark}]{.underline}. And
ozone isn\'t only bad for human health; [[it also contributes to]{.mark}
global [warming]{.mark}]{.underline}. Shindell recently totaled up all
the effects of [[methane]{.underline}]{.mark} emissions and realized
that the [[heating effect is more than 60 percent]{.mark} that of
[carbon dioxide\'s]{.mark}]{.underline}. \"So that tells you that
methane is a pretty big player.\" Methane in the atmosphere leveled off
in the 1990s, so it seemed that efforts to control industrial emissions
were keeping this problem gas in check. But since 2007, methane levels
have been on the rise again.

### No Impact - Models

#### Extinction claims inaccurately deviate from predictive modeling---adaptation checks worst case scenarios

**Willis, et. al, '10** \[Kathy J. Willis, Keith D. Bennett, Shonil A.
Bhagwat & H. John B. Birks (2010): 4 °C and beyond: what did this mean
for biodiversity in the past?, Systematics and Biodiversity, 8:1, 3-9,
http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14772000903495833, \]

Given that **[[this temperature increase was greater in magnitude and
rate to anything predicted]{.mark}]{.underline} for the next century**,
it is an extremely useful time interval to examine possible biotic
responses to 4 ◦ C and beyond. In order to assess biotic responses,
however, it is also important to have records with a good temporal
resolution, ideally annual resolution. A review of the vegetational
responses recorded in 11 sedimentary sequences with a suitably high
temporal resolution from around the North Atlantic region (Williams et
al., 2002), indicates that in North America and Europe, in less than 100
years, vegetation responded to the rapid climate change 11 600 years
ago. For tree populations, this change often occurred in less than two
or three generations. The nature of the response depended upon the
former vegetation; in central Europe (e.g. Willis et al., 1997; Feurdean
et al., 2007) and parts of eastern North America, for example, there is
evidence in many regions for a change from needle-leaved dominated to
broad-leaved dominated forest, often in less than 100 years. In
comparison, closer to the ice-sheets, in western Norway, there was a
rapid expansion in the herbaceous and shrub ﬂora and a later arrival of
trees, probably due to a time lag for migration from refugial areas
(Birks & Birks, 2008). The increase in tree populations, however, even
in these northerly regions was still rapid (Birks & Ammann, 2000). A
recent study from the East Baltic region, for example, indicates that
those trees that survived in northerly refugial populations (Betula,
Pinus, Picea) established within a century, suggesting climatedriven
ecosystem changes rather than gradual plant succession on new
deglaciated land (Heikkila¨ et al., 2009). Thus **[[some species
expanded very fast in response to]{.underline}]{.mark}** late-glacial
**[[warming.]{.underline}]{.mark}** There is also evidence, however, for
species that expanded slowly or largely failed to expand from their
refugia in response to this interval of rapid climate warming (Svenning
& Skov, 2007) suggesting that persistence and expansion is also
dependent on being in a location that was continuously suitable during
the glacial--interglacial 'cycle' (Bennett et al., 1991). Biotic
responses to this interval of rapid climate warming throughout Europe
and North America therefore include evidence for (i) rapid expansion of
in situ populations, (ii) large-scale species range shifts (Birks &
Willis, 2008), (iii) community turnover (Birks & Birks, 2008) and (iv)
the formation of novel community assemblages (Williams & Jackson, 2007).
However, **[[at no site yet studied,]{.mark} [anywhere in the world, is
there evidence]{.mark}]{.underline} in the fossil record [for
[largescale climate-driven extinction during this interval of rapid
climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Botkin et al., 2007). In some
regions there was local or regional extinction, as is apparent
throughout the cold-stages of the Quaternary when increasing numbers of
tropical species went locally or regionally extinct in Europe (Tallis,
1991; Svenning, 2003; Willis & Niklas, 2004). There is evidence in the
fossil record for the total extinction of only one species, the east
North American spruce Picea critchﬁeldii (Jackson & Weng, 1999), **[[but
evidence for widespread global extinction of
plants]{.mark}]{.underline}** in this interval of very rapid climate
warming **[[has yet to be demonstrated.]{.mark}]{.underline}** It had
been argued previously that the large-scale megafaunal extinction that
occurred at the end of the Pleistocene was climatically driven, but a
large number of studies now suggests that this was a predominantly
human-driven extinction event that spanned thousands of years (Koch &
Barnosky, 2006; Johnson, 2009) rather than a rapid response to the large
temperature increase at the late-glacial/post-glacial transition.

there's no substantial change**

as Badly Flawed,\" Heartland
Institute, https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news/national-climate-assessment-criticized-as-badly-flawed,
Mateo

The final version of the Fourth National Climate Assessment (NCA4),
reflecting the work of the 13 different federal agencies that make up
the U.S. Global Climate Change Research program (USGCCR), was released
on Friday, November 23. The 1990 Global Climate Research Act required
the president to establish the USGCCR, charged with issuing a report
describing the state of the climate and the economic, environmental,
health, and safety consequences of climate change, every four
years. **Predicting Extreme Harm** Upon NCA4's release, USGCCR
spokespersons stressed extreme estimates of harm included in the
1,600-page report. "The impacts and costs of climate change are already
being felt in the United States, and changes in the likelihood or
severity of some recent extreme weather events can now be attributed
with increasingly higher confidence to human-caused warming," NCA4 says.
NCA4's worst-case scenario assumes the world's human population will
grow to 12 billion by 2100, the rate of technological change will
stagnate, economic growth will slow, and fossil fuel use will be 300
percent greater than today. As a result, NCA4 estimates atmospheric
carbon dioxide concentrations will reach 950 parts per million (ppm), up
from 405 ppm at present, resulting in the global average temperature
rising by 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100. Among the myriad harms
NCA4 claims will occur by 2100 based on these assumptions are U.S. GDP
will be 10 percent lower than it otherwise would be; crop losses and
damage from extreme weather will top \$500 billion per year; and the
United States will experience \$141 billion in annual economic losses
from thousands of premature deaths from heat, plus billions of dollars
in losses from premature deaths and damage from extreme flood, wildfire,
and weather events the study predicts will happen more
regularly. **President Rejects Findings** When asked on November 26 his
thoughts on NCA4, President Donald Trump was unperturbed, maintaining
his previous skepticism about the dangers of anthropogenic climate
change. "I've seen it. I've read some of it," said Trump. "I don't
believe it." [This is a purely political report that Trump is right to
reject, says Tim Huelskamp, Ph.D.]{.underline}, president of The
Heartland Institute, which publishes *Environment & Climate News* and
produced its own detailed critique of a draft version of NCA4 in early
2018. ["This latest climate report is]{.underline} just more of the
same---except for even [greater exaggeration, worse
science]{.underline}, and added interference in the political process by
unelected, self-serving bureaucrats," said Huelskamp. "[This
report]{.underline} from the climate alarmist Deep State in our
government [is]{.underline} even more [hysterical]{.underline} than some
United Nations reports. "[The idea global temperatures could
rise]{.underline} as much as 12 degrees in the next 80 years[ is absurd,
and not a shred of actual data]{.underline} and observation [supports
that]{.underline}," Huelskamp said. "As noted in the Nongovernmental
Panel on Climate Change's report *Climate Change Reconsidered*, [global
temperatures have stayed largely the same for much of the last 20 years,
and sea levels have not been rising at an accelerated rate]{.underline}.
President Trump was required by law to release this report, but he is
not required to take it seriously---and he surely will not."'Blatantly
Absurd Conclusions' NCA4 is extremely inaccurate because it is based on
flawed computer models, says Jay Lehr, Ph.D., science director at The
Heartland Institute. "I have never seen such blatantly absurd
conclusions drawn entirely from mathematical models that use only a
limited number of variables," said Lehr. "[The physical evidence
conclusively shows the frequency and strength of hurricanes, floods, and
wildfires has been declining for years, not increasing]{.underline}. "Of
course, this shoddy science by Obama-era appointees serves its real
purpose: producing a preordained political outcome that puts more power
and money in the hands of the United Nations," Lehr said. The government
agencies involved in the report are putting politics above the pursuit
of truth, says University of Delaware climatology professor David
Legates, Ph.D. "The Obama administration demanded the use of the extreme
scenarios so the predicted impact on the populace would be substantial,"
Legates said. "This isn't about the science. If it were, there would be
discussions about the other scenarios and about the uncertainties in the
climate system and in the models that drive these scenarios. "They have
taken the worst possible scenarios and packaged them as if they were the
expected norm," said Legates. "Climate science has all but died in this
country."**'Completely Unbelievable'** NCA4 was written to incite
drastic action to fight climate change, says Tom Harris, executive
director of the International Climate Science Coalition. "The Fourth
National Climate Assessment, released just over a week before the 24th
Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change, seems designed to provide ammunition to those who want
drastic action on climate change," Harris said. "The problem is NCA4's
conclusions are so extreme as to be completely unbelievable and easily
dismissed by any thinking person." The cost estimates of the harm from
future climate changes are built on assumptions about carbon dioxide
emissions well outside mainstream analyses, says Patrick J. Michaels,
Ph.D., director of the Center for the Study of Science at the Cato
Institute.

"The 'social cost' of carbon dioxide emissions is highly dependent upon
the assumptions made in its calculation," said Michaels. "For example,
using the historical 7 percent discount rate and more modest equilibrium
climate sensitivities calculated by John Christy and Nic Lewis, the cost
actually becomes negative, meaning there is a net benefit of a few
dollars per emitted ton.

"By using lower discount rates and high emissions scenarios and
sensitivities, holdovers from the Obama administration were able to
calculate costs in excess of \$50 per ton," Michaels said.

### No Impact - Squo Solves

**Tech solves---reject their alarmist impact claims**

**Gertner 6-7-19 **(Jon, "Maybe We're Not Doomed After
All," https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/opinion/climate-change-hope-solutions.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,
ME)

As the effects of a warming climate intensify and a sense of impending
catastrophe grows stronger, it's becoming easier to give in to
environmental despair. Having spent the past five years studying the
Arctic and traveling around Greenland, I feel the pull as well. Glaciers
and sea ice are melting at an alarming rate; temperatures are rising at
a steady clip. To make matters worse, the Trump administration's recent
efforts to ignore a fact-based, scientific approach --- rejecting, for
instance, the use of computer projections to assess how a warming world
might look after 2040 --- leads me to worry that climate denialism is
moving from the scientific fringes to the institutional center. Still,
it's worth considering that [things may not be as bad as they
appear]{.underline}. I say this with a full understanding that most
indicators are pointing in the wrong direction. Yet I also
feel [we're]{.underline} in danger of [losing sight of two crucial and
encouraging aspects]{.underline} of our predicament.
The **[first]{.underline}** [is the extraordinary value
of]{.underline} the [climate knowledge]{.underline} we've amassed [over
the past 100 years]{.underline} --- a vast archive of data
and [wisdom]{.underline} [that gives us a fine-grained understanding of
how the planet is warming and how we can change the
trajectory]{.underline} we're on. [The second is the emergence of
potential solutions]{.underline}, the [products of]{.underline} a
half-century of [technological
innovation]{.underline}, [which may]{.underline} help us **[avert the
worst impacts]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} the [carbon dioxide and
other greenhouse gases we continue to release into the
atmosphere]{.underline}. (Last year carbon dioxide emissions were the
highest ever recorded.) Almost certainly, [these tools]{.underline}, if
used wisely, [could keep global average temperatures from rising 3.6
degrees Fahrenheit, or 2 degrees Celsius, from a preindustrial
baseline]{.underline}. Even lesser levels of warming are probably
hazardous, but that temperature is the point beyond which many
scientists believe the planet will suffer irreversible impacts from
extreme and dangerous warming. Recently, the entrepreneur and
technologist Saul Griffith undertook a study of energy consumption for
the Department of Energy and concluded that, using the United States as
an example, "**[decarbonization is not an unattainable
ideal]{.underline}**." **[In fact]{.underline}**, he surmised **[it
would be far easier than one might think]{.underline}**, [given our
wealth and technological know-how]{.underline}. [We don't need to assume
an attitude of fear and dread]{.underline}. **[Our scientific progress
is a story of technological optimism]{.underline}**, [defined
by]{.underline} an **[extraordinary]{.underline}** sense
of **[capability]{.underline}**. It shows what might be built and gained
in the coming decades, and not merely what could be lost. First, let's
consider this: For all the terror and gloom that global warming
portends, its discovery is one of the greatest achievements of modern
science. [Technology can now tell us everything]{.underline} from how
many tons of ice were shed by the glaciers in Greenland over the past
few years to how many millimeters the oceans rose. Indeed, almost every
fact or idea that informs the climate debate, from the number of
endangered species to the dangers of melting permafrost, [results from
countless scientists and engineers]{.underline}, working in the field
and in laboratories, over the course of a century. [This knowledge
derives]{.underline} not only [from]{.underline} heroic [human
expeditions]{.underline} to tropics, oceans, icecaps and deserts, [but
also]{.underline} from exquisite [orbiting satellites that constantly
scrutinize natural systems and human impacts on those
systems]{.underline}. We know how much we have to fix on this planet,
because we've figured out how to measure just about everything. In the
past few years, [some commentators]{.underline} have warned that modern
society's faith in technology has led to a mistaken belief that it will
save the world. They [embrace solutions that encourage widespread
behavioral changes]{.underline}, like consuming less, traveling
infrequently and adopting a plant-based diet. We're likely to need both
technological and personal transformations. [But in the
end]{.underline}, it's **[technology]{.underline}** that **[will save
us]{.underline}**, not only because it can but also because it will have
to. In many respects, **[technology is saving us
already]{.underline}**: [by]{.underline} identifying the magnitude of
the threat, [providing]{.underline} the [extraordinary
computing]{.underline} power required to run climate models to predict
the future, [and enabling]{.underline} [architects and engineers to
design for resilience against tempestuous storms and encroaching
seas]{.underline}. [Technology has made possible clean and efficient
energy systems]{.underline} that wouldn't have been achievable a few
decades ago, including cheap solar panels, LED lighting and batteries
for electric cars. We now have green buildings that reduce energy usage
and an emerging class of solar cells known as perovskites that may
greatly lower the costs of renewable energy, and we are developing
techniques to produce concrete that absorbs carbon dioxide rather than
emitting it. There is even room for techno-skeptics. A movement for
"natural climate solutions," like planting vast forests and using
agricultural methods that sequester carbon in the soil, will become
increasingly important as technology in the form of "integrated
assessment" computer models tells us how much this approach can mitigate
warming trends. In the coming years, moreover, [our ability to
improve technology will determine the viability of carbon capture
techniques to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide]{.underline} and the
value (or danger) of injecting aerosols into the atmosphere to shade the
sun, cool the earth and provide more time for a clean-energy transition.
The range of hypothetical [geoengineering]{.underline} ideas for the
Arctic [is equally audacious]{.underline}. One is to use wind power in
winter to pump water from the depths of the Arctic Ocean to the surface
to thicken sea ice so that it is more resistant to melting. Sea ice is
critical to cooling the planet, because it reflects sunlight that would
otherwise be absorbed by the ocean, heating it. (The downside of this
idea, which underscores the scope of the problem, is that 10 million
windmills would be needed.)

 

**Agroecology solves -- it makes the environment resilient**

**Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy 6-20-19 **("Agroecology:
Key to Agricultural Resilience and Ecosystem

The IPCC gives us 12 years to limit global warming to 1.5˚C. The IPBES
Global Assessment has revealed that nearly a million species are on the
verge of disappearance at an unprecedented rate of extinction. Climate
change has become a primary cause of biodiversity loss, while land use
change is a key factor in both the climate and biodiversity
crises. [Both the IPCC and IPBES call for "transformative" change that
can still reverse these catastrophic trends. Agroecology is a
transformative approach that can galvanize a just transition away from a
destructive conventional agriculture and food system to one that builds
agricultural resilience, rebuilds ecosystems, supports localized, fair
food systems and strengthens local communities. It is an innovative
process that seeks to produce significant amounts of food by maintaining
and enhancing biological and ecological processes]{.underline} through
practices that minimize the use of external inputs, recycle nutrients,
build healthy, fertile soils and conserve moisture in the
agroecosystem. [Agroecology puts more power in local farmers'
hands]{.underline}, in contexts where they have long been disempowered.
It is [built on traditional knowledge and cultural
practices]{.underline}, [enhanced by scientific advances, and
spread]{.underline} through farmer-to-farmer exchanges. The Food and
Agricultural Organization (FAO) defines [agroecology]{.underline} as a
scientific discipline, a set of practices and a movement. It [is a
dynamic concept that has evolved over decades to expand its scope from a
focus on agroecosystems]{.underline}---understanding field-level farming
practices that rely on high agrobiodiversity---[to include not only
ecological, but also socioeconomic, nutrition and even equity aspects of
agriculture and food systems]{.underline}. While there are many
techniques intended to improve environmental sustainability and
yields, [agroecology is an integrated approach to the entire
agroecosystem]{.underline} (rather than individual plants, animals,
humans or soil organisms). Agroecologists recognize that technological
advances are essential, but that they occur in specific socioeconomic
contexts that can either reinforce or challenge inequality and
environmental sustainability. Key agroecological principles, based on
experiential learning from social movements and networks of small-scale
farmers, landless farmers and farmworkers, include: Building on
indigenous practices and knowledge generation, as well as empowering
local farmers Recognizing women's central roles as seed keepers,
cultivators and workers [Developing new techniques through
experimentation and sharing among farmers and
workers]{.underline} Respecting food sovereignty---the right of peoples
to define their own food and agriculture systems, [allowing producers to
play a lead role in innovation and placing those who produce, distribute
and consume food at the center of decisions on food systems and
policies]{.underline} Despite agroecology's successes at withstanding
droughts---and hurricanes---there is a lack of awareness among
decision-makers of the significant potential of agroecology to tackle
challenges related to the climate and biodiversity crises. As
governments at the UNFCCC engage in the Koronivia Joint Work on
Agriculture (KJWA) on adaptation, soils, nutrient use, manure management
and livestock systems (see points: 2.c, d, and e), it is critical that
they take note of progress being made on agroecology in key U.N. bodies
and at national and sub-national levels to inform their discussions
leading to an agriculture decision at COP 26 and integrate them in KJWA.
In addition, these [developments in agroecology should also be a central
component in enhancing mitigation and adaptation]{.underline} within
NDCs. [Agroecology has been gaining ground in many U.N.
processes]{.underline}, especially those centered at the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO). A recent decision by the FAO's Committee
on Agriculture (FAO 2018 COAG/2018/5) to support agroecology as a key
approach to promote sustainable agriculture and food systems has given
rise to FAO's Scaling up Agroecology Initiative (SAI 2018), which aims
to support national agroecology transition processes through policy and
technical capacity that builds synergies between countries. SAI endorses
the 10 elements of agroecology that are based on seminal scientific
literature and inputs over a three year process of FAO regional and
international multi-stakeholder symposiums (2015-2018). [The Initiative
will develop, implement and continuously improve tools, instruments and
guidance]{.underline} documents for leading national agroecological
transitions through alliance building, co-creation of knowledge and
knowledge sharing. (See also five principles of agroecology and five
levels of agroecological transitions.) In addition, the U.N. Committee
on World Food Security (CFS) (the foremost inclusive intergovernmental
and international mechanism on food security and nutrition) requested
its High Level Panel of Experts (HLPE) in 2017 to elaborate on
agroecological approaches and other innovations for building sustainable
food systems that enhance food and nutrition security. This HLPE #14
report will be released in Rome in July 2019, and its recommendations
will be taken up for consideration in October 2019 during the CFS annual
meeting. A set of CFS decisions are expected in 2020. Decisions from the
CFS would not only guide national policies on food and agriculture and
contribute to informed national debates on food sovereignty and the
right to food, but also help guide the three Rome-based U.N. food
agencies in their regional and country level program development. The
KJWA process should in no way undermine the progress being made in these
other fora on agroecology and should seek to incorporate the benefits of
agroecology in both international and national level climate policy on
agriculture[. A review of scientific literature examining social and
economic indicators in 42 studies showed that adopting agroecological
practices increased yields]{.underline} (in 60% of comparisons), [labor
productivity]{.underline} (100% of comparisons) [and farm
profitability]{.underline} (56% of comparisons), [and decreased labor
demand]{.underline} (75% of comparisons, likely resulting from an
increase in yield and labor productivity). [Because of its emphasis on
minimal external inputs, instead recycling nutrients through a reliance
on biological processes and agrobiodiversity, agroecological practices
can be labor intensive but not necessarily cash intensive]{.underline}.
This is an area for further research as the social and economic
performance of agroecology and its indicators are not as well-documented
as its impacts on farming communities and other
practitioners. [Agroecology increases production in ways that enhance
biodiversity and nutritional diversity due to a reliance on integrated
cropping systems rather than unsustainable and intensive monocrop
production. This diversified approach also reduces vulnerability to
biotic and abiotic stress from weather and disease]{.underline}. [The
advantages of this approach were conclusively
demonstrated]{.underline} in the 2008 International Assessment of
Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD),
a multi-year study involving hundreds of experts and several U.N.
agencies. The findings were re-substantiated in a report submitted in
2010 to the U.N. Human Rights Council by the U.N. Special Rapporteur on
the right to food, Olivier De Schutter. It showed the additional value
of agroecology, not only for fast progress in the realization of the
right to food for vulnerable groups in various environments, but also
for economic development. The report called for appropriate public
policies to create an enabling environment. The KJWA should build upon
these and other [international processes that are well
underway]{.underline}. [A number of national and regional governments
are]{.underline} also [moving forward with policy and funding support to
institutionalize and operationalize agroecology]{.underline}. Parties
participating in the KJWA should take the time to understand what their
own governments are doing with regards to research and support for the
expansion, operationalization and implementation of agroecology. They
can learn from and build upon current international, national and
subnational processes. At a minimum, the discussions and any actions
taken through the KJWA must not undermine the enormous potential of
agroecology to meet international climate and food security goals.

#### The U.S Dollar is unmatched - making up a majority of the world's reserve

**Velina 1/9**

Since the United States entered into the Second World War considerably
late, it did not suffer as much damage or casualties as other countries
had. It also helped that its geographical location kept its cities from
suffering the infrastructural damage seen across cities in Europe and
Asia. This, in part, helped the American Empire to replace the British
Empire (although Britain is still an imperial power) as the global
hegemon, especially when the American economy took less time to recover
in comparison. And so began the **[[all-conquering march of the
U.S.]{.mark} [Dollar,]{.mark} undoubtedly [the]{.mark} [American
Empire's most powerful]{.mark} [expression of its global
domination]{.mark} and global monopoly.]{.underline}**

As per requirements during WWII, most of Europe under a war economy had
to import its consumer goods. The United States, which had yet to enter
into the War, was readily available to trade consumer goods with Europe
for gold; and it had done the same in the First World War, to which it
was also a latecomer. In other words, over the course of the two World
Wars, it had been accumulating these gold reserves so that by 1944 it
**[acquired [two-thirds of the world's reserves]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
thus **[[overwhelming]{.mark} Europe's [markets with dollar
loans]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[Having [gained the
economic]{.mark} and monetary [upper-hand, the U.S. sought to make the
Dollar the world's reserve currency]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} In
that same year, the Bretton Woods Conference --- also known as the
United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference --- reached an
agreement on a series of new rules for the post-WWII international
monetary system, leading to the creation of the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(IBRD). In other words, **[[almost every currency in the world was
required to be tied to the]{.mark} Dollar at a fixed
rate]{.underline}**, and the Dollar could only be tied to gold. This
catapulted the United States to global superpower status.

While its client states (such as South Korea, Saudi Arabia, and
Colombia) and its support for proxy forces were the worldwide economic
and military fronts of its power projection platform, the Dollar was the
international monetary facet. **[With Western [European powers indebted
to the]{.mark} U.S. [Dollar, the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates was free **[[to spread its influence
throughout their states and their politics]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
helping them to crush many of the communist and labour movements within
their own countries. It also helped to seal the Western European states'
alliances with the United States with the shared goal of destroying the
Soviet Union, as well as uniting in attacking other countries in Eastern
Europe and countries in the Global South that refused to allow U.S.
capital into their countries.

## UQ \-- DH Stable

#### Dollar hegemony is stable

**Lloyd 6/4** (Colin Lloyd, macroeconomic commenters, writer and
presenter, contributor to several free market publications. 4 June 2019.
\"U.S. Dollar Supremacy Could Quickly Fade\". American Institute for
Economic
Research.https://www.aier.org/article/us-dollar-supremacy-could-quickly-fade)

[[Being]{.mark}]{.underline} and remaining [[a reserve currency
is]{.mark} closely [tied to four broad factors]{.mark}: the [amount of
non-domestic debt]{.mark} denominated in your currency, the
[value]{.mark} and volume [of cross-border]{.mark} contractual
[obligations]{.mark} which designate your currency as the medium of
exchange, the [amount of currency reserves in issue]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} perhaps an arcane proposition in a fiat currency world,
[the international desirability of your currency]{.mark} as a store of
value. The [US dollar currently commands this privilege]{.mark}. It was
by no means the first reserve currency]{.underline}; the Roman Denari
was used throughout their empire in ancient times, during the middle
ages, the Venetian Ducato and Florentine Florin gained credence. [The US
dollar's predecessor, Sterling, achieved its time in office as a result
the decline of French dominance after the Napoleonic Wars. British trade
flourished and with it the merchants' needs finance.]{.underline} The
discount houses of Lombard Street, insurance brokers of Lloyd's coffee
house and even the stock jobbers' of Change Alley swiftly responded,
[creating the necessary financial instruments for Sterling to emerge as
the preeminent currency of international trade and finance]{.underline}.
You will note that trade followed by finance, for that is how the
relationship began, with trade as the master and finance the servant.
The passing of the baton from the UK to the US resulted from two
disastrous and expensive world wars and the subsequent demise of British
Empire and influence. As part of the Bretton Woods agreement, under the
gold exchange standard, the US dollar became the instrument of
conversion whilst it was pegged to gold at US\$35/oz. By the 1960s,
however, cracks were beginning to show. These economic conflicts between
short-term, domestic and long-term, international objectives, for the
manager of the reserve currency, were first defined by Robert Triffin.
In 1971 Triffin's dilemma became reality with the collapse of the
Bretton Woods agreement. [[Oil,]{.mark} notionally blamed for the
collapse, was, by this stage, [no longer priced in Sterling but in US
dollars.]{.mark} Gold was gone but the vast trade in oil allowed the US
dollar to retain its position through its sheer volume of
transactions.]{.underline} [[A mixture]{.mark} of inertia (what
economists call a network externality), military might and relative
value (when compared with more inflation-bent regimes) [rendered the US
dollar still supreme]{.mark}.]{.underline} In a 2016 essay for
Brookings - The dollar's international role: An "exorbitant privilege"?
former Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke, highlighted the following
[factors which have allowed the Dollar to maintain its
position:]{.underline} [Stability of value. Since the mid-1980s, the Fed
has done a good job keeping inflation low and stable. Liquidity. U.S.
financial markets, especially the U.S. Treasury market, are the deepest
and most liquid in the world... Safety. Despite Congressional
shenanigans surrounding the debt limit, there is a large supply of
dollar assets considered to be very safe, including Treasury
securities... Lender of last resort. [The Fed served as a backstop
provider of dollars during the financial crisis by instituting currency
swaps with fourteen central banks, including four in emerging
markets]{.mark}.]{.underline} Whilst many years of research has been
undertaken in an attempt to calculate the value of being the reserve
currency, Barry Eichengreen description is most succinct: \"It costs
only a few cents for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to produce a
\$100 bill, but other countries had to pony up \$100 of actual goods in
order to obtain one.\"

#### No US dollar collapse anywhere in the near future

**Watson 15** (Patrick Watson - a compulsive trend-observer and senior
economic analyst. Patrick specializes in a global macro perspective,
"Why Not to Worry about a US Dollar Collapse" -- Mauldin Economics,
https://www.mauldineconomics.com/resources/why-not-to-worry-about-a-us-dollar-collapse)

In a world without fixed exchange rates, a nation can gain an advantage
by manipulating its currency so that the value appears lower. This makes
exports seem less expensive to foreign buyers while discouraging
imports. The US has played this game masterfully in recent
decades---keeping the dollar low while still importing mass quantities
of goods from abroad. Something changed in the last few years, though.
The chart below shows the US Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar's
value against a basket of other major currencies. Notice how it shot
higher in the last half of 2014 and then stabilized in a much higher
range in 2015. The US Federal Reserve's decision to end its "QE3"
stimulus program, [[A major reduction in US oil imports as domestic
shale production soared]{.mark}, [The]{.mark} European [Central
Bank]{.mark}'s move to [ease the continent's debt crisis with new
stimulus]{.mark}]{.underline}, and A massive devaluation of the Japanese
yen. Compared to other world currencies, the US dollar is hardly
collapsing. It is strengthening, and no other currency shows signs of
catching up. Some currencies, no doubt, will collapse in the coming
decades, but the dollar is way down the list. How can this be?
Ironically, [cutting all ties to gold actually helps the
dollar.]{.underline} Currency values are always relative to another
currency. That means it is mathematically impossible for every currency
to lose value. When you sell currency A (whatever it is), you must
simultaneously buy currency B. That means some currency will always be
on top of the pile\... even if the pile is sinking. [[The dolla]{.mark}r
has [stayed relatively strong, despite]{.mark} US [economic problems,
because other currencies look even worse]{.mark}. Many foreign investors
see the US as an island of stability in a storm-tossed world. They want
to own [dollar-denominated assets]{.mark}. That [keeps the dollar
strong]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, look at this chart showing the
US dollar exchange rate against the Japanese yen over the last five
years. In 2012, before the Bank of Japan launched its latest stimulus
program, it only took around 80 yen to buy a dollar. By mid-2015, the
rate was over 120 yen to the dollar. If you are an American investor
worried about the dollar, imagine how this must look to Japanese
investors. They might gladly trade places with you, if they could get
dollars in exchange. The same applies, more or less, to all other
currencies. [The dollar looks more attractive than the home currencies
of many foreign investors[. Anything can happen in the short
term]{.mark}, of course, [but a dollar collapse is unlikely in this
environment.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### AT Squo Replacement

#### US dollar hegemony cannot be replaced

**Anderson 18** (Anthony Anderson - Enhanced corporate culture via
education in the numismatic fields that we served while becoming a
member of the American Numismatic Association, Industry Council For
Tangible Assets, "Currency Wars: Countries Reduce Dollar Dependence",
https://gsiexchange.com/currency-wars-countries-reduce-dollar-dependence/)

[There is a]{.underline}n alarming [trend in which more and more
countries are seeking to gain independence from the US
dollar.]{.underline} Here's what's been happening lately: Last week,
Iran announced its plans to adopt the euro in place of the dollar as its
main currency for international exchange. A few months ago, Venezuela
attempted to launch an oil-backed cryptocurrency. Earlier this year,
China introduced the first ever yuan-denominated oil contracts; a
successful event that raised the yuan's status on the international
stage. In the meantime, Russia has been actively increasing its gold
reserves. Their primary goal is not only to end dollar dependence but to
end the US dollar's global dominance. [Despite their efforts,
[none]{.mark} of them have [come close to dethroning the dollar's global
status.]{.mark} Amid tensions between the US and other nations,
including its allies, and Trump's preference for a strong dollar, some
analysts believe that the [countries maneuvering against the dollar are
looking to exploit the opportunities presented by this current state of
geopolitical unease. Attempts to replace the dollar have been
made]{.mark} several times [in the past. All attempts have
failed]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Dollar heg high and economists project it to stay that way -- empirics prove yuan and euro don't stand a chance

**Pritchard 16**

Evans Pritchard 2016 \[Ambrose Evans-Pritchard at the Telegraph, "AEP:
Dollar hegemony endures as share of global transactions keeps rising",
The Telegraph///dvb

**[[The US dollar is tightening its grip on the global financial system
at the expense of the euro,]{.mark} [entrenching American
heg]{.mark}emony and rendering the US Federal Reserve more powerful than
at any time in history.]{.underline}** Newly-released data from the Bank
for International Settlements (BIS) show that the dollar's share of the
\$5.1 trillion in foreign exchange trades each day has continued rising
to 87.6pc of all transactions. It is the latest evidence confirming the
extraordinary resilience of the dollar-based international order,
confounding expectations of US financial decline a decade ago. Roughly
60pc of the global economy is either in the dollar zone or closely tied
to it through currency pegs or 'dirty floats', and the level of debt
issued in dollars outside US jurisdiction has soared to \$9 trillion.
This has profound implications for monetary policy. **[[The Fed has
become the world's central bank whether it likes it or not, setting
borrowing costs for much of the global system]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
The BIS data shows that the volume of transactions in which the euro was
on one side of the trade has slipped to 31.3pc from 37pc in 2007. The
dollar share has ratcheted up to 87.6pc over the same period. It is much
the same picture for the foreign exchange reserves of central banks, a
good barometer of global trust. The dollar share has recovered to
63.6pc, roughly where it was a decade ago. The Fed has become the
world's central bank whether it likes it or not, setting borrowing costs
for much of the global system The euro share has tumbled over the last
eight years from 28pc to 20.4pc, and is barely above Deutsche Mark share
in the early 1990s. **[["There are no foreseeable rivals to the dollar
as a viable reserve currency,"]{.underline}]{.mark}** said Eswar Prasad
from Cornell University, author of "The Dollar Trap: How the US Dollar
Tightened Its Grip on Global Finance". ["The US is hard to beat]{.mark}.
The US has **[[deep financial markets, a powerful central bank and legal
framework the rest of the world has a great deal of trust
in]{.underline}]{.mark}**," he said. The eurozone is crippled by the
lack of a unified EU treasury, joint bond issuance, and a genuine
banking union to back up the currency. It would require a change in the
German constitution to open the way for fiscal union, an unthinkable
prospect in the current political climate**[[. Neither the euro nor the
yuan have succeeded in displacing the dollar.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
"There are existential questions about the euro. The tensions pulling
monetary union apart have not been resolved. It not going to challenge
the dollar even if it does get its economic act together, and that
doesn't look likely," he said. Prof Prasad, former head of the
International Monetary Fund's China desk, said the Chinese yuan is
gaining global currency share steadily - at the cost of the euro -- but
it would be decades before it comes of age. First China has to tame its
\$27 trillion credit bubble and break out of the middle-income trap,
weaning its economy from investment-led catch-up growth on steroids. He
said the Communist system had become even more rigid under president Xi
Jinping, raising the risk that social and political order "might unravel
suddenly and dramatically," in the event of an economic shock. With
hindsight it is clear that the US was never as weak as it looked in the
aftermath of the Lehman crisis in 2008, when China seemed to be walking
tall and much of the emerging world was in a secular commodity boom. The
pendulum has since swung back. Zero rates and quantitative easing by the
Fed flooded emerging markets with dollar liquidity, leading to credit
booms that have mostly ended painfully over the last for years. The
shale revolution in the US and the revival of its energy intensive
industries have eliminated much of America's current account deficit.
The US Treasury's draconian policies forced a quick clean-up of the US
banking industry, in stark contrast to years of debilitating drift in
Europe. The 20pc surge in the dollar index since mid-2014 has silenced
any serious talk of a dollar crisis, and revealed just how painful this
can be for emerging markets. "**[[The world is more reliant on the
dollar than ever before]{.mark}. I don't think people appreciate this
enough,"]{.underline}** said Stephen Jen from Eurizon SLJ Capital.

# NEG \-- AT Thumpers

### Generic

#### Their thumpers aren't real disruptions of monetary hegemony -- just examples of new shifts in the same system, since large external imbalances threatening global finance have existed since the late 90's.

Imbalanes, Currency Wars, and U.S. Monetary Hegemony. September 2016.
www.maxwell.syr.edu/uploadedFiles/parcc/news/S.%20Brown-%20Final%20Paper.pdf\]

Six years into the recovery from the Great Recession its underlying
causes remain contentious. One candidate for core contributor has been
less prominently featured in the popular press - global financial
imbalances between chronic current account surplus and deficit
countries. Moreover, **[[macroeconomists have ascribed the]{.mark}
recent [crisis besetting]{.mark} the European Monetary Union [(EMU)
to]{.mark}]{.underline}** similarly **[outsized [imbalances between
surplus]{.mark} countries like Germany, Finland and the
Netherlands]{.underline}**, on the one hand, **[[and deficit
countries]{.mark} such as Spain, Portugal and Greece]{.underline}**, on
the other (Pettis, 2013; Wolf, 2014; King, 2016).\
**[Seeking the fundamental cause for the Great Recession]{.underline}**,
and for the subsequent EMU crisis, in intercountry trade and financial
imbalances **[is understandable. [Large external imbalances]{.mark}
among key countries and regions [have persisted since the]{.mark}
late-19[90's]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- for the Eurozone since the 2000's
-- widening in the run-up to the crisis. **[[Yet, correlation is not
causation]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the argument linking the financial
crisis to trade (financial) imbalances is hardly air-tight. YNT. Nor is
it self-evident that **[[the Achilles heel]{.mark} of the international
monetary and financial system then and now [lies in net capital flows
and]{.mark} the asymmetry of [macroeconomic adjustment between surplus
and deficit countries]{.mark},]{.underline}** respectively. For example,
**[[a distinct challenge]{.mark} to the international monetary system
[lies in]{.mark}]{.underline}** its (in)ability to cope with the
**[[explosion of gross foreign assets and
liabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Does the global financial crisis owe
more to the heightened pace of financial globalization writ large,
rather than intercountry imbalances more specifically?\
This paper argues that **[the central conflict]{.underline}** that
galvanizes the international community **[over today's global monetary
and financial architecture combines]{.underline}** these **[twin
developments]{.underline}** -- the persistence of large net directional
cross-border flows and **[[the accumulation of]{.mark} large gross
[external financial claims]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Of particular concern
is how these features intersect with reference to the world's leading
economy. **[[The centrality of the United States]{.mark}']{.underline}**
public-cum-private financial sector **[has been a feature of the global
system since]{.underline}** the end of **[World War II. It [assumed new
shape with the collapse of the Bretton Woods
system]{.mark}]{.underline}** beginning in 1971 and proceeding all the
way up to the Great Recession. The causes and aftermath of the Great
Recession moreover place US monetary and financial dominance in fresh
perspective. In essence, conflict over the contours of the international
monetary and financial system (IMFS) overwhelmingly centers on the
special structural position occupied by the United States.

### Default Key

#### Dollar hegemony is stable -- the US is able to sustain itself so long as the dollar is a good currency safe from default -- the plan destroys that, but the thumpers do not

Fields & Vernengo \'11 \[David Fields and Matias Verengo are writers for
the Levy Economics Institute at Bard College. Hegemonic Currencies
during the Crisis: The Dollar versus the Euro in a Cartalist
Perspective. April 2011. www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp_666.pdf\]\
This paper suggests that **[[the dollar is not threatened as the
hegemon]{.mark}ic international currency]{.underline}**, and that
**[most [analysts are incapable of understanding]{.mark} the
[resilience]{.mark} of the dollar, not only because they [ignore the
theories of monetary hegemonic stability]{.mark}]{.underline}** or what,
more recently, has been termed the **[geography of money]{.underline}**;
but also as a result of an incomplete understanding of what a monetary
hegemon does. The hegemon is **[[not required to maintain credible
macroeconomic policies]{.underline}]{.mark}** (i.e., fiscally
contractionary policies to maintain the value of the currency), but
rather to provide an **[[asset free of the risk of
default]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It is argued that **[[the current crisis
in Europe illustrates why the euro is not a real contender for
hegemony]{.mark} in the near future]{.underline}**.

### Oil Retal Key

#### Dollar hegemony is contingent on OPEC oil -- other considerations pale in comparison -- thumpers are tiny in relation to this cornerstone of the dollar-denominated financial system

https://www.e-ir.info/2013/04/08/the-hegemony-of-the-us-dollar/.\]\
Over recent years, the debate surrounding dollar hegemony has faced a
renewed revival in a manner that ties in with broader speculation about
the future of the USA's global role. Not since Robert Keohane's "After
Hegemony" (1983) has the debate been quite as lively academically.\
Of late, the spotlight has increasingly focused on the continued role of
the dollar in global finance. There are those, such as Barry
Eichengreen, who have speculated the dollar's "reign is near an end".
The case for why this may actually be beneficial has gained traction
since a UN report which sought to make the case for an overhaul to the
global reserve system.\[1\] They are by no means in a minority[**. I
argue, however, that [there is reason to believe that there are]{.mark}
[important considerations relating to]{.mark} both governance and [the
strength of US institutions- both governmental and financial- that mean
the end of the]{.mark} [dollar']{.mark}s crucial role [in the global
financial system may not be]{.mark} as [imminent]{.mark} as some are

This is, of course, a discussion that is intertwined with considerations
regarding the future of broader US influence. In this article, I shall
consider **[the [key]{.mark} [conditions]{.mark} that [have maintained
dollar hegemony]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and criteria to be met by any
challengers who may seek for their own domestic currency to enjoy what
is coined the "exorbitant privilege"\[2\] of reserve currency status.[\
**There is little doubt that the outcome of any transition from dollar
dominance would be significant, and would represent a wider shift in the
balance of power.**]{.underline} With international goods and
commodities priced in the dominant reserve currency, the US dollar, the
movements of other currencies relative to the reserve currency have a
very real impact. **[[The 2008 decline]{.mark} in sterling against the
dollar\[3\] [highlights exactly this]{.mark}. A bout of inflation
followed, putting upward pressure on a whole range of commodities, the
most important being food and petrol. If the value of the domestic
currency isn't what concerns the majority of citizens, you can bet that
the cost of a basket of commonly purchased goods is.\]{.underline}**
So, what makes a currency 'dominant' as a reserve currency and what
exactly is it used for? In the reserve sense, we only consider how much
of a given currency (or denominated assets) sits in the vaults of
central banks. In a wider respect, however, it would also include the
currency which international companies predominantly use to price their
exports, and the currency which the majority of commodities are priced
in. In each of the aforementioned, the US YNT dollar is still very much
the most significant currency and accounts for approximately 62% of
official foreign exchange reserves- up from 59% in 1995.\[4\] What is
also striking is that although the US only accounts for approximately
15% of global trade\[5\], the dollar accounts for 84.9% of daily foreign
exchange transactions.\[6\] **[[The reason being that almost]{.mark}
[all intra-state trade for goods be it oil from OPEC states, or
wine]{.mark} exports [from Chile]{.mark} sold to Japanese buyers, [the
transaction is likely to be completed in dollars]{.mark}. All this is
despite over a decade of forecasts over its demise; it was previously
hypothesised the Euro would replace the dollar-- or at least achieve
equal status, for example.\]{.underline}**
The reasons for the dollar's continued dominance, despite a financial
crisis in 2008 and a ballooning deficit are a textbook case study of
political economy.\
First and foremost, there are the economic factors that contribute to
continued dollar hegemony. Perhaps most significant is the fact that the
USA has by far the largest and most liquid market for the assets
denominated in its currency. The debt issuance by the US Treasury is
substantial, meaning there are plenty of Treasury Bills and other 'risk
free' assets which can be held by foreign central banks (thus solving
the so-called Triffin Dilemma\[7\]). Whilst the Eurozone has a similarly
large economy, it has no asset that is similar in its nature to US
Treasury stock; that is, mutually guaranteed by the entity as a whole,
rather than just a single member state. **[[While Euro]{.mark}
denominated [assets are plentif]{.mark}ul, their [quality varies from
one member]{.mark} state [to another]{.mark}.\
[The dollar is]{.mark} also [complemented by the]{.mark} sheer size of
the [US economy]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The USA remains the world's
largest economy and imports vast quantities of goods. As such, those
wishing to sell their goods to the USA will have to do so on the terms
of US companies, part of which is likely to mean invoicing in dollars.
The US also has the benefit of better growth prospects over most of
Europe, and a more open economy than China in a number of important
regards. Both of these factors combined ensure **[[the USA is still seen
as the most attractive large economy]{.mark} for investors. It also
means [US assets are easily tradable and have low]{.mark}er
[bid-ask]{.mark} price [spreads]{.mark}.\
Politically, the comparative [stability of the USA is also a
contributing factor.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Even in the face of a recent
downgrade, US Treasury Stock still commands a large degree of confidence
in the market given its long and unblemished track record. Those
investing in other dollar assets can also be assured that any US assets
are unlikely to be unfairly seized by the state or affected by uneven
enforcement of the law.

## AT BRICs

### Top Level

#### BRICS hasn't dismantled dollar hegemony -- its countries are indebted and highly reliant on dollar-dominated institutions. Those who claim it might dethrone the U.S. dollar are utterly divorced from reality.

**Chossudovsky \'18** \[Michel Chossudovsky is a Canadian economist and
author who works for the Centre for Research on Globalization. BRICS and
the Fiction of "De-Dollarization". July 24, 2018.
https://www.globalresearch.ca/brics-and-the-fiction-of-de-dollarization-2/5441301.\]**[[\
There has been a lot of media hype regarding BRICS]{.mark}.\
While the creation of BRICS has significant geopolitical implications,
both [the AIIB]{.mark} as well as [the proposed BRICS]{.mark}
Development Bank (NDB) [and its]{.mark} Contingency Reserve Arrangement
[(CRA) are dollar denominated entities]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Unless
they are coupled with a multi-currency system of trade and credit,
**[they do not threaten dollar hegemony. Quite the opposite, [they tend
to sustain and extend dollar denominated lending]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Moreover, **[they replicate several features the Bretton Woods
framework.\]{.underline}**
Towards a Multi-Currency Arrangement?\
What is significant, however, from a geopolitical standpoint is that
China and Russia are developing a ruble-yuan YNT swap, negotiated
between the Russian Central Bank, and the People's Bank of China,\
The situation of the other three BRICS member states (Brazil, India,
South Africa) with regard to the implementation of (real, rand rupiah)
currency swaps is markedly different. These three highly indebted
[**[countries are in the straightjacket of IMF-World Bank
conditionalities]{.underline}**. **[They do not decide
on]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[fundamental [issues of monetary policy
and]{.mark} macro-[economic reform without]{.mark} the green light from
the [Washington based]{.mark} international [financial
institutions]{.mark}.]{.underline}**\
Currency swaps between the BRICS central banks was put forth by Russia
to:\
"facilitate trade financing while completely bypassing the dollar. "At
the same time, the new system will also act as a de facto replacement of
the IMF, because it will allow the members of the alliance to direct
resources to finance the weaker countries." (Voice of Russia)\
While **[Russia has formally raised the issue of a multi-currency
arrangement]{.underline}**, **[the Development Bank's structure does
not]{.underline}** currently "officially" **[acknowledge such a
framework:\]{.underline}**
"We are discussing with China and our BRICS parters the establishment of
a system of multilateral swaps that will allow to transfer resources to
one or another country, if needed. A part of the currency reserves can
be directed to \[the new system\]" (Governor of the Russian Central
Bank, June 2014, Prime news agency)\
Currency Dictatorship. The Struggle to End US Dollar Hegemony\
**[[India, South Africa and Brazil have decided not to go along with a
multiple currency arrangement]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which would have
allowed for the development of bilateral trade and investment activities
between BRICs countries, operating outside the realm of dollar
denominated credit. In fact they did not have the choice of making this
decision in view of the strict loan conditionalities imposed by the
IMF.\
**[[Heavily indebted under the brunt of]{.mark} their external
[creditors, all]{.mark} three [countries are faithful pupils of
the]{.mark} IMF-[World Bank]{.mark}. The central bank of these countries
is [controlled by Wall Street and the IMF]{.mark}. For them to enter
into [a "non-dollar" or an "anti-dollar" development]{.mark} banking
arrangement with multiple currencies, [would have required]{.mark} prior
[approval of the IMF.]{.mark}\]{.underline}**
The Contingency Reserve Arrangement\
The CRA is defined as a "framework for provision of support through
liquidity and precautionary instruments in response to actual or
potential short-term balance of payments pressures." (Russia India
Report April 7, 2015). In this context, the CRA fund does not constitute
a "safety net" for BRICS countries, it accepts the hegemony of the US
dollar which is sustained by large scale speculative operations in the
currency and commodity markets.\
In essence the CRA operates in a similar fashion to an IMF precautionary
loan arrangement (e.g. Brazil November 1998) with a view to enabling
highly indebted countries to maintain the parity of their exchange rate
to the US dollar, by replenishing central bank reserves through borrowed
money.\
The CRA excludes the policy option of foreign exchange controls by BRICS
member states. In the case of India, Brazil and South Africa, this
option is largely foreclosed as a result of their agreements with the
IMF.\
**[[The dollar denominated]{.mark} \$100 billion [CRA]{.mark} fund [is a
"silver platter" for Western]{.mark} "institutional
[speculators]{.mark}"]{.underline}** including JP Morgan Chase, Deutsche
Bank, HSBC, Goldman Sachs et al, which are involved in short selling
operations on the Forex market. Ultimately the CRA fund will finance the
speculative onslaught in the currency market.\
Neoliberalism firmly entrenched\
An arrangement using national currencies instead of the US dollar
requires sovereignty in central bank monetary policy. In many regards,
India, Brazil and South Africa are (from the monetary standpoint) US
proxy states, firmly aligned with IMF-World Bank-WTO economic diktats.\
It is worth recalling that since 1991, India's macroeconomic policy was
under under the control of the Bretton Woods institutions, with a former
World Bank official, Dr. Manmohan Singh, serving first as Finance
Minister and subsequently as Prime Minister.\
Moreover, **[[while India is an ally of China and Russia under BRICS, it
has entered into a new]{.mark} defense]{.underline}** cooperation
**[[deal with the Pentagon]{.underline}]{.mark}** which is
(unofficially) directed against Russia and China. It is also cooperating
with the US in aerospace technology. India constitutes the largest
market (after Saudi Arabia) for the sale of US weapons systems. And all
these **[[transactions are in US dollars.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### The BRICS bank is a pathetic excuse of a challenge to the dollar's hegemony -- it operates using USD and its supporters are themselves deeply invested in the dollar.

The **[[new]{.mark} financial institutions announced by the Brics
nations in July -- a [development bank and]{.mark} an [arrangement to
share currency reserves]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- have been compared by
many observers to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.\
There is no doubt that **[they [reflect frustration in the developing
world over governance at]{.mark} the [multilateral institutions]{.mark}
that emerged [from the Bretton Woods]{.mark} summit 70 years
ago.]{.underline}** These remain dominated by the US and western Europe
despite their relative economic decline. In truth, however**[, the [new
initiatives break little ground.]{.mark}\]{.underline}**
President Vladimir Putin of Russia has said **[the Brics countries want
to end the international monetary system's dependence on the policy of
US authorities. If so, [they are off to a poor
start]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Whereas only 10 per cent of the World
Bank's paid-in capital was contributed in dollars, all the start-up
funding for the **[[Brics bank will be in greenbacks, creating new
demand for dollar assets]{.mark}.]{.underline}**\
Brazil, Russia, India and China could mitigate this problem by pooling
the \$5.1tn in foreign exchange reserves they hold between them. A
shared stock of reserves could be considerably smaller, and still
provide an ample buffer against a balance of payments crisis. This would
allow participating countries to avoid the conditions attached to
IMF/YNT loans.\
Mr Putin claims the so-called contingent reserve arrangement, under
which each country would have conditional access to others' foreign
reserves, "creates the foundation for an effective protection of our
national economies from a crisis in financial markets".\
In fact, it is far too small for this purpose, and it is barred from
making big loans without IMF involvement. China can borrow \$6.2bn
without approval from the fund; for the other participants the number is
smaller. This is chicken feed. The IMF approved \$38bn in loans to
Russia in the 1990s, and \$15bn in standby credit to Brazil in 2002. Net
private financial flows to emerging markets today are about 10 times
what they were in 2002, meaning that even larger loans would now be
needed in similar crises. Mr Putin knows this, which is why Russia
currently holds over \$400bn in foreign exchange reserves.\
The natural riposte is that the Brics are only just beginning their
collaboration. But beefing up the fledgling institutions will not be
simple. The 13-member Chiang Mai initiative, created after the 1997 Asia
crisis, has yet to commit a dime to mutual assistance -- despite in
theory having created a pool of \$240bn in combined reserves. Members
can call on significant funds only if they are subject to the
surveillance (and stigma) entailed by an IMF programme. Governments in
the region remain hesitant to extend credit to one another during
crises. The Brics countries, even more disparate, will share this
reluctance.\
As for development financing, funds for basic infrastructure and
healthcare in poor countries could do much good. But the founders of the
new bank risk being carried away by their own hyperbole**[. [India and
China are the World Bank's biggest borrowers -- and therefore]{.mark}
its [biggest beneficiaries]{.mark}. Together with Brazil, [they have
\$66bn in outstanding loans, a third more than the]{.mark} entire
initial subscribed [capital of the new Brics
bank]{.mark}.\]{.underline}**
The **[Brics leaders have rightly been critical of the US Congress for
failing to reform the IMF]{.underline}**. But **[[their own bank is
hardly more democratic]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The World Bank's 37
founding members now command less than half of the votes in that
institution's governing body. The Brics bank's articles of agreement
accord its founding members a permanent minimum voting share of 55 per
cent -- irrespective of how its membership evolves.\
**[[This is not to say that the world should be satisfied with the
legacy of Bretton Woods. But it does illustrate how difficult it is to
improve on it.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

## AT Takeover

### General

**Dollar hegemony strong and stable EVEN as multiple currencies attempt
to take over**

**Costigan 18** [(Thomas Costigan, 7-6-2018, "The US dollar and it's
challenges ",]((Roosevelt%20Institute,%205-5-2009,%20)
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/wusa.12339)

Since World War Two, the United States dollar became and remains the
global reserve currency. This status in international trade and
investment has given the US the ability to exercise hegemonic power
around the world. **[[In recent years]{.underline}]{.mark}**, there have
been **[[attempts by competitor nations]{.underline}]{.mark}** notably
China, Russia, and Iran **[[to replace the dollar\'s exclusivity in
bilateral trade]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Their **[[intention is to
undermine the ability of]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[US]{.underline}]{.mark}** to [[continue **as the world\'s
hegemon**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is argued that this [**[outcome is
unlikely to be achieved in the near term]{.mark}**,]{.underline} because
of the continuing reliance on the US dollar.

### AT China

#### China doesn't thump and never will -- its currency is puny compared to the dollar and despite its industrial strength, it has failed miserably to establish the RMB as a serious contender.

publisher of WOLF STREET, and worked in Texas and Oklahoma, including a

**[[Dollar Hegemony is a tough nut to crack.]{.mark}\
[China is taking another baby step]{.mark} in promoting the
internationalization of the renminbi and nibble on the hegemony of the
US dollar:]{.underline}** It's pushing a proposal to add a pile of yuan
to the \$240 billion currency swap agreement between ASEAN plus China,
Japan, and South Korea, in order reduce the system's reliance on the US
dollar and to enhance its own economic clout in the region, according to
the Nikkei.[\]{.underline}
On May 2, the **[[finance ministers]{.mark} and central bankers of
ASEAN]{.underline}** -- Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia, Thailand,
Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar -- along
with those from China, Japan, and Korea **[[will meet in Fiji to
discuss]{.mark} modifications to [the swap agreement]{.mark}, the Chiang
Mai Initiative]{.underline}**.[\]{.underline}
China, which co-chairs the meeting with Thailand, has added language to
the draft joint statement concerning use of Asian-currency contributions
to the pool -- which for now is still entirely in dollars -- as "one
option" to enhance the swap arrangement.[\]{.underline}
"Allowing participants to access Asian currencies in an emergency could
encourage their use in other contexts, including foreign exchange
reserves, the thinking goes," the Nikkei said. "The idea also
anticipates a long-term rise in demand for these currencies in regional
investment and trade."[\
**"China in particular sees it as [another step on the path to
internationalizing the yuan]{.mark}**]{.underline} and expanding its
economic influence in the region. But [**the proposal [is likely to be
complicated by U.S. alarm]{.mark} at the prospect of Beijing expanding
its currency's role at the dollar's expense."**\]{.underline}
The Chiang Mai Initiative was a response to the 1997 Asian currency
crisis. It consists of a pool of US dollars, contributed by members,
that members can draw on when their currencies come under attack. Since
its establishment in 2000, the dollar pool has been increased to \$240
billion. China is now lobbying the other members to add yuan and yen to
that pool.[\
**[This is]{.mark} just one more effort by China to internationalize its
currency,**]{.underline} which has been **[[a tough and thankless
slog]{.mark} so far, [despite the size of the Chinese economy]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} its giant [weight in the global economic
fabric.]{.mark}\]{.underline}**
In terms of global reserve currency, **[[the]{.mark} renminbi [(RMB) has
a share of only 1.9%]{.mark}, in fifth place, and barely ahead of the
Canadian dollar, but [miles behind the US dollar]{.mark} (61.7%) and the
euro (20.7%)]{.underline}**. Over the past two years, the RMB has
**[made [only microscopic headway]{.mark} as a reserve
currency.\]{.underline}**
And as an international payments currency, **[[the RMB has
failed]{.mark} similarly [to crack the]{.mark} co-[hegemony of the
dollar]{.mark} and the euro.\]{.underline}**
"With more than 1,900 financial institutions now using the RMB for
payments with China and Hong Kong, the internationalization of RMB
carries great strategic significance" for banks and financial
institutions, gushes SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial
Telecommunication), which tracks the progress of the RMB as payment
currency.[\]{.underline}
But in March 2019, the **[RMB had a minuscule share of merely 1.22% for
international cross-border payments by value]{.underline}**
(cross-border payments from one Eurozone country to another Eurozone
country are excluded). This minuscule share put the RMB in 8th position,
**[just behind the Swiss franc]{.underline}**:[\]{.underline}
Two years ago, in March 2017, the RMB's share had been 1.05%. In other
words**[, in two years, [the share of the RMB]{.mark} had [ticked up
by]{.mark}]{.underline}** a whopping **[[17 basis
points]{.underline}]{.mark}**, from 1.05% to 1.22%. At this pace --
about 8.5 basis points per year -- **[[the RMB will reach a share of 3%
by 2040.]{.mark}\]{.underline}**
Meanwhile, the dollar's share increased to 45.58%, from 45.44% two years
ago; and the euro's share increased to 32.80%, from 32.28% two years
ago. So by this measure, and for this time span, [**[the RMB made
minuscule progress]{.mark} against smaller currencies but lost ground
against the dollar and euro.**\]{.underline}
So chipping away at the dollar-euro co-hegemony as payments currencies
will take some patience and lots of baby steps, such as China's efforts
to add yuan to the swap arrangement under the Chiang Mai
Initiative.[\]{.underline}
The troubled internationalization of the RMB YNT was topic of a 2018
report by SWIFT's Chief Executive of APAC & EMEA, Alain Raes, looking
back on 2017, when the RMB internationalization had actually
backtracked.[\]{.underline}
On one hand, its internationalization was supported by major trends,
such as:[\]{.underline}
The growth of cashless payments, "mainly driven by the digital giants
Alipay and WeChat Pay"[\]{.underline}
"The far-reaching Belt & Road Initiative"[\]{.underline}
"The globalization of Chinese banks and their adoption of SWIFT
gpi"[\]{.underline}
"The progress of China's Cross-border Interbank Payment System
(CIPS)."[\]{.underline}
On the other hand, there was this: "Despite these trends, **[there are
[a number of critical success factors necessary
for]{.mark}]{.underline}** widespread [**[adoption]{.mark} of the
RMB."**\]{.underline}
And that's where it gets tough. **[[The headwinds the RMB
faces]{.underline}]{.mark}** "in the short term" **[[include "capital
controls]{.mark} imposed [by the Chinese government" and]{.mark}
"ongoing [concerns over the]{.mark} Chinese [currency's
depreciation]{.mark}.\]{.underline}**
The report sees the Belt and Road Initiative as China's key strategy to
muscle in on the dollar as a payments and finance currency. The Belt and
Road Initiative involves large infrastructure projects in Asia, Europe
(particularly Eastern Europe), the Middle East, Latin America, and
Africa.[\]{.underline}
"There is opportunity for China to use the RMB as a currency" for these
projects, and Chinese companies could "potentially move to transactions
denominated in RMB," SWIFT's report said. "Not unexpectedly, banks are
stepping up to take advantage of the shift."[\]{.underline}
"China is also pushing countries along the BRI to allow greater usage of
the RMB, though **[[countries are not always responding
favorably]{.underline}]{.mark}**," SWIFT says, thus listing another
headwind for the RMB: Resistance from other countries.[\]{.underline}
China is known to be patient and can measure progress in decades, rather
than in quarters. But the **[[progress]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the
**[RMB's internationalization [must be nerve-wracking
slow]{.mark}]{.underline}**, even for China.

#### China has never dethroned the dollar -- doing so requires international treaties and negotiations -- not just a growing economy.

After the 2008 crisis, **[there was a decline in dollar preponderance in
the international economy compared to China's rise]{.underline}**, as
the latter gradually attempted to **[reduce dependence on the American
currency]{.underline}** and to discuss the possibility of the yuan
becoming the main currency used in international market transactions in
the future.\
But is this a threat to the dollar's hegemony? According to several
researchers, **[[monetary hegemony is achieved]{.mark} not only through
coercion but also [through the consensus of all
parties]{.mark}]{.underline}** involved as a synthesis between
domination and direction, or as Perry Anderson says, as a "dynamic
balance between force and consent."\
From An Historical Perspective\
Let´s take a look at the history behind this American monetary hegemony.
At the end of World War II, the Bretton-Woods agreement confirmed the
United States' central position in the international market with the
definition of the international dollar-gold standard. Soon after, in
1971, Richard Nixon established the inconvertibility of the dollar
versus gold relation.\
This led **[the United States [to establish "strong dollar
diplomacy]{.mark}]{.underline}**" in 1979.\
With this act, the dollar shifted to a floating exchange system,
separating the relationship and allowing the dollar to float in a
flexible way. This act was called "Nixon Shock" because president Nixon
made this decision without consulting the international monetary system
members or even his own State Department. YNT. The United States went on
to issue the key currency of international trade without any external
restriction because there was no more need to maintain your local
currency fixed compared to the official price of gold.\
This change made by Nixon meant the exit of gold from the international
monetary system and kept the world economic market (as it was before)
dependent on the dollar---or, rather, the US banks. This scenario led to
speculation in the 1970s that culminated in the devaluation of the US
dollar against other currencies. This **[led the United States to
establish "strong dollar diplomacy]{.underline}**" in 1979, raising its
interest rates, reducing its international market currency in order to
reduce their vulnerability, and attracting investment capital from all
over the world. This caused the appreciation of the US currency and
**[consolidated the American monetary standard]{.underline}**.\
This historical scenario makes it clear that the United States has been
able to demonstrate a high capacity to coordinate the world economy from
its interests. Even after the 2008 crisis, which drew the world's
attention to the weaknesses of the American economic system (the "Dollar
Dilemma"), there is no break from this economic order. Investors turned
to **[[US treasury bonds, which have maintained their central
position]{.mark} in the world economic system.]{.underline}** This
brought an image of a reliable economy, representing a safe haven for
investors, increasing and reinforcing the concept of universal reserve
of value exerted by the dollar due to the crucial role played by the
American state.\
More Recently\
**[[China\'s growth]{.underline}]{.mark}** in recent years **[[has
raised questions]{.underline}]{.mark}** about the dollar's central role
in the international economy.\
According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), from 2010 to
2013, the dollar increased its share of total foreign exchange
transactions from 84.9 percent to 87 percent, ranking the first position
followed by the euro, which fell from 39.1 percent to 33.4 percent. The
Brazilian real went from 0.7 percent to 1.1 percent, and the yuan rose
from 0.9 percent to 2.2 percent. According to the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), in 2014, 61 percent of the total international reserves
identified were denominated in US dollars.\
China\'s growth in recent years, in conjunction with the 2008 crisis,
has raised questions about the dollar's central role in the
international economy. The IMF reviews the basket of currencies every
five years. In 2010, the possibility of including the yuan in the basket
appeared but was not accepted. In 2015, there was a new revision, and
this time its entry was established the following year. In October 2016,
the yuan became part of the basket of IMF reserve currencies, along with
the US dollar, euro, pound sterling, and the yen. You can see the
proportions in the internationalization index of major world currencies
below (data collected in 2014):\
This fact represents the recognition of the global financial system to
the progress made in China in recent years with the reform of its
monetary and financial system. Chinese researchers believe this addition
to the IMF currency basket was a success, making the yuan the fifth
largest currency in the world, but despite having a growth rate of
internationalization above 85 percent in comparisons with other
currencies like the dollar and the euro, **[[there is still a long way
to go:]{.mark}\]{.underline}**
\[...\] the **[[process]{.underline}]{.mark}** of RMB
internationalization **[[is still in the initial
stage]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and the degree of internationalization is
far lower than some international currencies such as dollar, euro and
yen. Therefore, the process of **[[RMB internationalization still
requires further promotion and improvement]{.mark}.]{.underline}**\
Don't Get Too Excited\
The internationalization of a currency is a long, multi-step process
that involves the consolidation of currency as an international common
use object, a vehicle for foreign exchange transactions, a unit of
commodity price definition and, finally, acting as a reserve currency.
For a currency to be international, it must meet a set of requirements
favoring currencies that already have some of these conditions.\
Among these requirements are the trust in its future value, a high
degree of liquidity, and a chance of acceptance by others guaranteed
through influence on the transactional network. Especially at the
political level, domestic political stability and effective governance
are needed in the country issuing the international currency. The more
friends and allies, the greater the willingness of other countries to
use the currency of that country.\
International banks will only want to accumulate yuan if they can move
their money into and out of China freely.\
It is important to note that the dollar has a history. **[[The dollar
is]{.mark} recognized as [an international currency]{.mark} not only
[because of the US market size but also its history in international
treaties and negotiations]{.mark} seeking the alignment of mutual
interests in international trade.]{.underline}** The yuan still has a
long way to go in that direction.\
**[[In order for the yuan be the next international curren]{.mark}cy,
perhaps the [C]{.mark}hinese [C]{.mark}ommunist [P]{.mark}arty [would

Russia and China plan to ditch the US dollar and switch to local
currencies in international trade but [yet another [delay to]{.mark} a
new system for [yuan-rouble settlements show]{.mark}s just [how complex
it is to develop]{.mark} [an]{.mark} [alt]{.mark}ernative to the
greenback.]{.underline}

Russia, China and a number of other countries are aiming to cut their
dependence on the US dollar, as Washington uses access to the dollar
payment system as a weapon to punish nations and individuals for
breaking US laws, even outside the United States.

In November, Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said that Moscow
and Beijing were finalising a memorandum to settle more bilateral trade
in the rouble and yuan.

The two countries were also reportedly in talks to launch a new
cross-border system to improve direct payments of trade invoices, and
for the use of China's UnionPay credit card in Russia and Russia's Mir
card in China.

But late last month, Russian media quoted Siluanov as saying that Moscow
had decided to step away from Beijing's proposed plan.

China and Russia look to ditch dollar with new payments system in move
to avoid sanctions

Talks would continue between the two countries' central banks, as well
as between Russia's Ministry of Finance and China's Ministry of
Commerce, the reports said, without offering details of the plan.

Given the growth in Russia-China trade and their opposition to US
sanctions via the dollar payment system, Beijing and Moscow were likely
to keep working towards a system acceptable to both sides, analysts
said.

Like a growing number of countries, China and Russia are keen to work
out an alternative to protect their banks and bankrollers from the US'
secondary sanction power of prosecuting entities that deal with
sanctioned companies or individuals from Russia, Iran or Venezuela.

But other nations, such as India, aim to enter a bilateral arrangement
to cut their ballooning trade deficit with China. It's no easy task
though -- just before the deal with Moscow was put on hold, Beijing
rejected an Indian proposal for a rupee-yuan transaction system.

[[The US dollar is]{.mark} the [preferred]{.mark} currency for
international trade [because it is]{.mark} one of the [least
volatile]{.mark} and thus less prone to a sudden
depreciation.]{.underline}

[The [setback for]{.mark} the [new payments]{.mark} infrastructure
[shows]{.mark} just [how difficult it is to shift away from]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} [US]{.mark}-dominated status quo.]{.underline}

Dmitry Dolgin, Russia chief economist at ING Bank, said that the
memorandum between China and Russia was supposed to improve financial
infrastructure for settlements in those currencies.

"The shelving of the agreement means the \[foreign exchange\] clearing
will not become easier any time soon," Dolgin said.

The US dollar is the preferred currency for international trade because
it is one of the least volatile and thus less prone to a sudden
depreciation. Russia's rouble is a more volatile currency partly due to
existing US and European sanctions and partly because its main export is
energy, which leaves the rouble vulnerable to changes in petroleum
prices.

China and Russia: new BFFs thanks to an insecure US

Evghenia Sleptsova, senior emerging market economist at Oxford
Economics, said that the greater stability of the yuan over the rouble
was a plus for Russian exporters and a minus for Chinese exporters, who
had no incentive to add currency risks to an already volatile commodity.

And while China's "Belt and Road Initiative" and the Eurasian Economic
Union are forging economic ties between the two countries, China is fast
replacing Russia as a dominant economic power in the region, which might
make Russia reluctant to accept Chinese financing and projects,
according to Otilia Dhand, senior vice-president at the intelligence
division of Teneo, a management consultancy.

"Russia and China are developing cooperation in several areas and these
intensifying collaboration is partially driven by their shared
opposition to the US dominance in the world," Dhand said.

[But the economic gains were modest, with some Chinese investment
falling through in even the most promising areas such as the energy
sector, she said.]{.underline}

[[China has]{.mark} also [slowed down]{.mark} its efforts to
internationalise its currency in the last three years [because of
concerns about capital outflows amid slowing econ]{.mark}omic
[growth.]{.mark} [Beijing is]{.mark} strictly scrutinising and
[controlling]{.mark} outbound [investments]{.mark} by Chinese
individuals [and businesses]{.mark} even though it encourages foreign
investors to plough money into the country.]{.underline}

China and Russian ties, rooted in energy deals, buffeted by ecomomic
headwinds

Still, the role of the yuan and the rouble in Russia's financial and
trade transactions has grown in the last few years, and the strategic
partnership with China will continue to deepen, especially if the US
remains in an adversarial position to both, according to Dolgin.

That growth has been aided by China setting up a "payment versus
payment" (PVP) system for yuan-rouble transactions in 2017, paving the
way for China to use PVP systems for yuan transactions with other
currencies along the belt and road route. The PVP systems reduce
settlement risk as well as the risk of transactions taking place in
different time zones, and improve foreign exchange market efficiency.

In 2014, China and Russia signed 38 energy, trade and finance deals and
a currency swap worth 150 billion yuan (US\$22 billion). Russia had
sought trade links with China after its forceful annexation of Crimea
soured ties with the United States and European Union.

In bilateral trade with China, about 14 per cent of payments are already
done in yuan, and about 7 to 8 per cent in the rouble, according to
Russia's Finance Ministry.

The Russian central bank is also buying yuan for its foreign reserves,
purchasing US\$44 billion worth of the Chinese currency in the second
quarter of 2018, while selling more than US\$100 billion of US dollars.
Russia held US\$67 billion in yuan as of mid-2018, 15 per cent of its
international reserves.

China's yuan has become the fourth largest component of Russia's
international reserves after the euro (32 per cent), the US dollar (22
per cent), and gold (17 per cent).

Russia wants to see bilateral trade with China top US\$200 billion by
2020.

The People's Bank of China did not respond to requests for comment.

#### **Yuan usage is low even at a key point during China's drive to overtake dollar hegemony---shows that it will never happen**

**Tan \'18** 2/2/18, Huileng Tan \|\| Huileng covers China\'s global
expansion as a reporter for CNBC \|\| China\'s currency is still nowhere
near overtaking the dollar for global payments, CNBC \|\|
https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/02/china-currency-yuan-the-rmb-isnt-near-overtaking-the-us-dollar.html

China is on a drive to promote the use of its currency globally but
[[this is]{.mark} still [far from upsetting the greenback,]{.mark}
according to an important global metric.]{.underline}

[Data released this week from Swift, the global interbank system that
transfers trillions of dollars worth of currency daily, showed that just
1.61 percent of domestic and cross-border payments processed in December
were denominated in yuan (also known as renminbi, or RMB.)]{.underline}

"The RMB has had a difficult year in 2017 and struggled to realize its
potential for growth," Michael Moon, Swift's head of payments markets
for Asia Pacific, said in a news release.

Swift noted in its report that, [[despite the]{.mark} growing
[importance of China in the]{.mark} global [economy]{.mark} and various
strategic measures to support its currency, [yuan usage remains low
and]{.mark} ["the pace of adoption]{.mark} remains [lower than
expected,"]{.mark} Alain Raes, Swift's chief executive for Asia Pacific
and Europe, the Middle East and Africa, wrote in a report about the
Chinese currency.]{.underline}

It's pretty much still a dollarized world, Swift noted in its report,
with the U.S. currency accounting for just under 40 percent of
cross-border payments in December 2017. While that was lower than the
same month in 2015 and 2016, it was not the yuan but the euro that
gained over the greenback.

The third and fourth most dominant currencies were the British pound and
the Japanese yen, respectively.

In fact, the Chinese currency's share as a total of global payments fell
against the year-ago period. The yuan accounted for 1.68 percent of
international payments in December 2016. The currency's share was 2.31
percent in December 2015.

[A major reason why the renminbi has not gained traction among
international users is that [the government has]{.mark} instituted
[strong controls over]{.mark} its financial system, particularly
regulatory measures to stem the [money moving overseas]{.mark} for
property and other purchases.]{.underline}

Uncertainty about capital controls and regulation will likely persist
this year, so the usage of the yuan isn't poised to increase, Moon
suggested.

Slow start but there's potential

Still, there are budding signs that international institutions are
warming up to the Chinese currency --- or just that they're being
increasingly compelled to use it.

An early adopter of the Chinese yuan is Pakistan, the central bank of
which said in January it will be replacing the dollar with the RMB for
bilateral trade and investment with Beijing.

In January, central banks in Europe revealed plans to hold the yuan as
part of their foreign currency reserves.

A free float for the yuan is at least four or five years away

Among recent developments bolstering China's financial clout on a global
scale is MSCI finally giving its nod to the addition of mainland shares
into its emerging market index, as well as the launch of various
so-called "connect" programs in Hong Kong that will allow international
investors to tap into mainland assets.

The world's second-largest economy is also reportedly planning a
yuan-denominated oil futures contract, which may be convertible into
gold. If that futures contract becomes a benchmark, the geopolitically
important oil industry could see a shift in power.

The developments come as the U.S. is widely perceived to be turning
inward under the administration of President Donald Trump just as China
is aggressively pursuing a greater leadership role globally.

But even though the building blocks for the internationalization of the
renminbi are in place, [[getting private support]{.mark} beyond
[governments can be tough,]{.mark}]{.underline} said DBS economist Chris
Leung.

"It will take a longer time for the private sector to completely accept
RMB as a settlement currency," Leung wrote in a recent note.

The biggest issue is the convertibility of the Chinese currency, which
is still being largely controlled by Beijing, he said.

How would a yuan-denominated crude futures contract impact the dollar?

There's little doubt Beijing wants to internationalize the RMB to
increase the domestic economy's attractiveness for foreign investors and
bolster its political ambitions. Under the leadership of veteran central
banker Zhou Xiaochuan, the country has ushered in financial reforms and
expanded the yuan's global reach.

In October 2016, the International Monetary Fund included the Chinese
currency in its Special Drawing Rights basket, which already included
the dollar, euro, British pound and Japanese yen.

The next major move that may nudge the world to use more of the yuan
could be Chinese President Xi Jinping's pet project, the Belt and Road
Initiative.

"The global economic landscape is shifting and China's strategy, along
with the RMB, has a role to play. Though the two are not fully aligned
yet, there is opportunity for China to use the RMB as a currency for
upcoming infrastructure projects expected as part of the Belt & Road
Initiative," said Swift's Raes.

### AT China/Russia

#### De-dollarization hasn't happened in Russia and China and those shifts will be extremely difficult. Specifically, OIL IMPORTS are significant to this shift!

**Weir \'18** \[Fred Weir has been the Monitor\'s Moscow correspondent,
covering Russia and the former Soviet Union, since 1998. He\'s traveled
over much of that vast territory, reporting on stories ranging from
Russia\'s financial crash to the war in Chechnya, creeping Islamization

Putin and his repeated returns to the Kremlin, and the ups and downs of
US-Russia relations. An end to the dollar\'s global hegemony? The
Kremlin sees an opportunity. October 12, 2018.
https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2018/1012/An-end-to-the-dollar-s-global-hegemony-The-Kremlin-sees-an-opportunity.\]\
For average Russians, a small personal hoard of US dollars has always
represented a place of safety amid the wild ups-and-downs that continue
to beset the country\'s national currency, the ruble.\
So it triggered a touch of panic among them when the Russian government
confirmed long-standing rumors that it is working on a plan to insulate
the economy from escalating US sanctions through
**[["de-dollarization]{.mark}."]{.underline}**\
The Trump administration has increasingly worked to weaponize the US
dollar, by using its hegemonic position as the world\'s "reserve
currency" to punish any entity or country that attempts to defy
proliferating unilateral US sanctions against Russia, Iran, and China.
And the Kremlin is seizing what it sees as an opportunity to force the
dollar out of its privileged position in global trade and finance.\
The idea might have sounded quixotic a decade or so ago, when Russia and
China first started talking about it. For advocates, it has a rousing
rhetorical ring to it, but experts say **[it\'s [an extremely difficult
reality to chang]{.mark}e in practice. [Even Russia and China]{.mark},
the world\'s leading anti-dollar activists, [have]{.mark} so far
[only]{.mark} [managed to shift]{.mark} about [a quarter of their
own]{.mark} \$60 billion [bilateral trade into other
currencies]{.mark}.\]{.underline}**
But now the European Union has announced that it will create a special
financial infrastructure to continue trading with Iran, despite the
threat of "secondary sanctions" from Washington. It will have to be
built from scratch, to effectively avoid any use of the US dollar or the
global banks and financial circuits that fall under US regulation. The
EU, whose own currency, the euro, is a potential contender to take the
dollar\'s place, has indicated that other signatories of the Iran
nuclear deal, such as Russia and China, might have access to their new
payment system for "legitimate" trade with Iran.\
In the changing environment other countries, even India, which purchases
weapons from sanctioned Russian companies, may find themselves looking
for ways to circumvent the dollar and the US scrutiny that comes with
it.\
"Of course this plays into Putin\'s hands, because anything that makes
the US look like the enemy, with other countries supporting us, bolsters
his public image," says Andrei Movchan, economic policy expert with the
Carnegie Center in Moscow. "But this is being driven by the threat that
new sanctions, being prepared in Washington, would prohibit Russian
banks from dealing in US dollars."\
"In fact, this whole discourse about sanctions and how to evade them is
becoming permanent. And, in principle, **[switching to the use of other
currencies]{.underline}** is feasible; [it **[wouldn\'t be easy,
and]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[would [impose a lot of new
costs]{.mark}]{.underline}**, but it can be done."\
The dollar\'s deep reach\
**[[There are short-term risks]{.mark} for the Kremlin in moving against
the dollar.]{.underline}** The Moscow daily Moskovsky Komsomolets
reported this week that nearly \$20 billion has been withdrawn from
Russia in the past three months, almost 50 times the outflow for the
same period last year, in part due to the growing official talk about
banning the dollar.\
But Russian officials have rushed to reassure average citizens that
their hard-won right to hold bank accounts denoted in foreign currency
is not under threat. Instead, they have cast the issue in geopolitical
terms, warning that the multiplication of US sanctions against Russia is
reaching a point where Washington itself might ban Russian banks from
any transactions in dollars. Thus, they say, the country needs to ready
its financial system to meet that challenge.\
"More and more countries, not only in the East but also in Europe, are
beginning to think about how to minimize dependence on the US dollar,"
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists last week. "And they
suddenly realize that: a) it is possible, b) it needs to be done, and c)
you can save yourself if you do it sooner."\
Since the end of World War II, **[[the US d]{.mark}ollar [has been the
world\'s]{.mark} de facto [reserve currency]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Most
goods traded internationally are priced in dollars, as **[is 40 percent
of global debt and 64 percent of all governments\' foreign currency
reserves.\]{.underline}**
Besides spreading a net of subtle American financial control over much
of the world, this has benefited the US in a variety of other ways. The
widespread demand for dollars in international trade, particularly oil
and gas, keeps the dollar strong and US interest rates low, and
contributes to its reputation as a "safe haven" currency. Even during
the financial collapse of 2008, people the world over rushed to buy
dollars, and dollar-denominated assets such as US treasury bills, in
order to keep their money safe.\
That, in turn, enables the US government to run very high budget
deficits which, despite frequent cries of alarm from conservative
commentators, has yet to create anything like the debt crises that often
sink lesser economies, such as Greece. (YNT)\
Speaking to an international economic forum in Vladivostok last month,
Vladimir Putin warned that US debt is a time bomb that threatens global
stability, and it behooves everyone to get as far away from the dollar
as possible as fast as they can. "US foreign debt amounts to \$20
trillion. What will be next? Who knows?" he said.\
'**[[No one wants to hold rubles']{.underline}]{.mark}**\
But it\'s **[easier said than done. [Russia would like to be paid for
its exports, especially oil, in a currency other than
dollars]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The new Russian government plan will
reportedly offer tax incentives for Russian companies that do business
abroad in rubles, which would boost the Russian currency and its
international reputation.\
"You can talk all you like about de-dollarization, **[but no one wants
to hold [rubles]{.mark}, which have [lost value consistently
over]{.mark} the past [four years]{.mark},"]{.underline}** says Dmitry
Oreshkin, head of the Mercator Group, an independent Moscow-based
political think tank. "When you sign contracts, do business over a
period of time, **[[everyone needs a reliable currency]{.mark} that
preserves its value. [So we are talking about
dollars]{.mark}]{.underline}**, or maybe euros."\
Russia has succeeded in making the ruble the only currency for domestic
transactions, and it has created a domestic payment system, the Mir
card, which is independent from US-based international payment systems
like Visa and Mastercard, and hence sanctions-proof. Yet the Mir card
has only 400 participating domestic banks and companies, and is used
mainly by the Russian government to pay its employees and pensioners.\
"The ruble-dollar rate remains the standard for Russians. **[[They might
use rubles, but they think dollars]{.mark},"]{.underline}** says Natalya
Orlova, chief economist for Alfa Bank, one of Russia\'s leading private
commercial banks.\
"**[This [talk about de-dollarization doesn\'t mean it will be
implemented]{.mark}. It implies that you should switch, it creates
uncertainty, makes the dollar sound toxic. But [in practice, it would
be]{.mark} [very complicated, and costly, and it would have to be very,
very gradual."]{.mark}]{.underline}**

## AT NOPEC

#### OPEC is a powerless organization -- it is losing control of the oil markets because Saudi Arabia is acting independently. Thus, anti-OPEC thumpers don't apply, but specific action against Saudi Arabia, a powerful oil producer in its own right, still does

[The death of Opec]{.mark}, the oil-producers cartel, [has been
predicted]{.mark} many times in the past]{.underline}**, but **[rarely
[from a member of the club which is why]{.mark}]{.underline}** this time
**[[it might be correct]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\
So, when **[[Iran\'s Oil Minister]{.mark}, Bijan Zanganeh,
[warned]{.mark} earlier this week]{.underline}** on the sidelines of a
meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries **[[that a
private production]{.mark} [deal]{.mark} negotiated [between Russia and
Saudi Arabia \"threatened the existence of
Opec]{.mark}]{.underline}**[\" he was **[not
exaggerating.]{.underline}**]{.mark}\
What particularly annoyed Zanganeh was what he called unilateralism, the
teaming of two big oil producers to effectively decide what all Opec
members should do.\
Adding insult to injury was the fact that one of the countries deciding
oil production quotas for the next nine months is not a member of Opec
(Russia is classified as an observer) while the other, Saudi Arabia is a
regional enemy.\
But, behind the latest oil production and price-rigging exercise is an
alarming development that no-one in Opec is prepared to admit and
that\'s the fact that **[[the cartel]{.mark} and its friends [have ceded
control of oil to the U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline}** and will struggle to
get it back YNT before the renewable energy revolution hits full steam.\
The best way to demonstrate the transfer of oil-control to the U.S. (or
should that be return of control) is to consider two questions: which
country has the greatest demand for oil and which country is the biggest
producer?\
To both questions the answer is the U.S., and while there might be an
argument over the precise numbers because of Opec\'s artificial
production controls the reality is that the **[[U.S. has stormed back
into global oil production leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}** courtesy of
output from shale and other hard rocks which have been tamed **[[by
modern tech]{.mark}nologies such as directional drilling and rock
fracturing.\]{.underline}**
The U.S. is also the leader in total oil and gas demand, with China a
close competitor in a global economy which is showing signs of slowing
which will further reduce demand for oil.\
This is Opec\'s ultimate problem because **[while the cartel\'s members
might believe they control the oil market]{.underline}**, and can
increase and decrease production to manipulate the price, **[the reality
is that [the game has changed from a time when a small group of]{.mark}
oil [producers]{.mark} [could hold the world]{.mark} to
[ransom]{.mark}.]{.underline}**\
Having a supply competitor in the U.S. is a bad enough for Opec, but
having a rival which is also the world\'s major oil user is double
trouble, especially as the reason the U.S. has reclaimed is oil
leadership is not simply a matter of having the right geology, it\'s
more about having the right technology \-- and that technology is
transferable from one oil-rich location to another.\
The [latest **[production cuts]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[by Opec and
Russia might [have the]{.mark} desired [effect of]{.mark} boosting the
oil price]{.underline}** though in doing that it **[also encourages
[increased U.S. shale output]{.mark}.]{.underline}**\
In a way, **[[Opec is simply subsidizing U.S.]{.mark} shale-oil
[production]{.mark}]{.underline}** as its members try to get the price
to a level where they can balance their budgets.\
The irony of what\'s happening can best be seen in comments from the
Saudi oil minister, Khalid al-Falih, who said after the Opec meeting
that U.S. shale oil would one day peak and go the same way as every
other oil basin.\
\"It will peak, plateau and then decline,\" al-Falih said.\
He\'s absolutely right because that\'s what happens to every oilfield,
and mine, over time.\
But what he neglected to add is that the same process of peaking,
plateauing and declining is what will also happen to Saudi and Russian
oilfields.\
What will last a lot longer than the geology of those fields is the
technology to extract difficult or unconventional oil and gas in the
U.S. and the rest of the world as the technology is mastered and
exported.\
**[[Opec might not be dead but it\'s]{.underline}]{.mark}** certainly
**[[a club with]{.underline}]{.mark}** some **[[anxious members who are
starting to worry]{.underline}]{.mark}** how long they can stick
together.

"The U**[.S. oil [industry and]{.mark} oil [producing states
would]{.mark} ﬁercely [oppose the bill]{.mark}]{.underline}** as OPEC
serves as **[key buffer to low oil prices]{.underline}** and any removal

stated in the report, which was sent to Rigzone.\
"We at Fitch Solutions expect the **[bill to fail if brought to a vote

In the report, Fitch Solutions highlighted that the U.S. House Judiciary

Exporting Cartels Act. This stage is prior to the ﬂoor action phases in
which the bill is put on the calendar, debated, and ultimately voted on,

#### Threats prove retaliation against the dollar is real and possible

**Zhdannikov et al. 4-4**-19 (4/4/19, Dmitry Zhdannikov, Rania El Gamal,
and Alex Lawler \|\| Exclusive: Saudi Arabia threatens to ditch dollar
oil trades to stop \'NOPEC\' - sources, Reuters \|\|
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-usa-oil-exclusive/exclusive-saudi-arabia-threatens-to-ditch-dollar-oil-trades-to-stop-nopec-sources-idUSKCN1RH008)

LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) [- [Saudi Arabia is threatening to sell its oil
in currencies other than the dollar]{.mark}]{.underline} if Washington
passes a bill exposing OPEC members to U.S. antitrust lawsuits, three
sources familiar with Saudi energy policy said.

They said the option had been discussed internally by senior Saudi
energy officials in recent months. Two of the sources said the plan had
been discussed with OPEC members and one source briefed on Saudi oil
policy said Riyadh had also communicated the threat to senior U.S.
energy officials.

The chances of the U.S. bill known as NOPEC coming into force are slim
and Saudi Arabia would be unlikely to follow through, but t[he fact
[Riyadh is considering]{.mark} such [a drastic step]{.mark} is a sign of
the kingdom's annoyance about potential U.S. legal
challenges]{.underline} to OPEC.

In the unlikely event Riyadh were to ditch the dollar, it would
undermine the its status as the world's main reserve currency, reduce
Washington's clout in global trade and weaken its ability to enforce
sanctions on nation states.

["The [Saudis know they have the dollar as the nuclear option]{.mark},"
one of the sources familiar with the matter said.]{.underline}

"The Saudis say: let the Americans pass NOPEC and it would be the U.S.
economy that would fall apart," another source said.

Saudi Arabia's energy ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

A U.S. state department official said: "as a general matter, we don't
comment on pending legislation."

The U.S. Energy Department did not respond to a request for comment.
Energy Secretary Rick Perry has said that NOPEC could lead to unintended
consequences.

DOLLAR HEGEMONY

NOPEC, or the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act, was first
introduced in 2000 and aims to remove sovereign immunity from U.S.
antitrust law, paving the way for OPEC states to be sued for curbing
output in a bid to raise oil prices.

While the bill has never made it into law despite numerous attempts, the
legislation has gained momentum since U.S. President Donald Trump came
to office. Trump said he backed NOPEC in a book published in 2011 before
he was elected, though he not has not voiced support for NOPEC as
president.

Trump has instead stressed the importance of U.S-Saudi relations,
including sales of U.S. military equipment, even after the killing of
journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year.

[[A move]{.mark} by Saudi Arabia [to ditch the dollar would resonate
well with]{.mark} big [non-OPEC oil producers such as Russia]{.mark} as
well as major consumers [China and the E]{.mark}uropean [U]{.mark}nion,
which have been calling for moves to diversify global trade away from
the dollar to dilute U.S. influence over the world economy.]{.underline}

[[Russia,]{.mark} which is subject to U.S. sanctions, [has tried to
sell]{.mark} oil [in euros and]{.mark} China's
[yuan]{.mark}]{.underline} but the proportion of its sales in those
currencies is not significant.

Venezuela and Iran, which are also under U.S. sanctions, sell most of
their oil in other currencies but they have done little to challenge the
dollar's hegemony in the oil market.

However, if a long-standing U.S. ally such as Saudi Arabia joined the
club of non-dollar oil sellers it would be a far more significant move
likely to gain traction within the industry.

WHAT IF?

Saudi Arabia controls a 10th of global oil production, roughly on par
with its main rivals - the United States and Russia. Its oil firm Saudi
Aramco holds the crown of the world's biggest oil exporter with sales of
\$356 billion last year.

Depending on prices, oil is estimated to represent 2 percent to 3
percent of global gross domestic product. At the current price of \$70
per barrel, the annual value of global oil output is \$2.5 trillion.

Not all of those oil volumes are traded in the U.S. currency but at
least 60 percent is traded via tankers and international pipelines with
the majority of those deals done in dollars.

Trading in derivatives such as oil futures and options is mainly dollar
denominated. The top two global energy exchanges, ICE and CME, traded a
billion lots of oil derivatives in 2018 with a nominal value of about
\$5 trillion.

Just the prospect of NOPEC has already had implications for the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Qatar, one of the core
Gulf OPEC members, quit the group in December because of the risk NOPEC
could harm its U.S. expansion plans.

Two sources said that despite raising the dollar threat, Saudi Arabia
did not believe it would need to follow through.

"I don't think the NOPEC bill will pass but the Saudis have 'what if'
scenarios," one of the sources said.

In the event of such a drastic Saudi move, the impact would take some
time to play out given the industry's decades-old practices built around
the U.S. dollar - from lending to exchange clearing.

Other potential threats raised in Saudi discussions about retaliation
against NOPEC included liquidating the kingdom's holdings in the United
States, the sources said.

The kingdom has nearly \$1 trillion invested in the United States and
holds some \$160 billion in U.S. Treasuries.

If it did carry out its threat, Riyadh would also have to ditch the
Saudi riyal's peg to the dollar, which has been exchanged at a fixed
rate since 1986, the sources said.

[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, the world's largest oil consumer,
[relied heavily on Saudi]{.mark} and OPEC [supplies]{.mark} for
decades - while supporting Riyadh militarily against its arch-foe
Iran.]{.underline}

But soaring shale oil production at home has made Washington less
dependant on OPEC, allowing it to be more forceful in the way it deals
with Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern nations.

Over the past year, Trump has regularly called on OPEC to pump more oil
to lower global oil prices, and linked his demands to political support
for Riyadh - something previous U.S. administrations have refrained from
doing, at least publicly.

#### The plan would trigger Saudi's "nuclear option"

**DiChristopher 4-5**-19 (Tom DiChristopher is an award-winning
multimedia journalist who covers energy for CNBC.com \|\| Saudi Arabia
is reportedly mulling nuclear option of stripping the US dollar from oil
trade,
CNBC\|\|https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/05/saudi-arabia-is-reportedly-mulls-stripping-us-dollar-from-oil-trade.html)

The U.S. dollar is the dominant currency in oil trading, but [[Saudi
Arabia is]{.mark} reportedly [considering selling its crude in other
currencies]{.mark} if American lawmakers pass an anti-OPEC
bill.]{.underline}

The discussions, reported by Reuters, suggest that [[Riyadh is preparing
a strategy]{.mark}]{.underline} to deal with potential passage of the No
Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act, known as NOPEC. The legislation
is widely viewed as a longshot, which means the Saudi move to
marginalize the dollar is unlikely to come to pass.

[Still, [the kingdom has discussed the proposal with]{.mark} other [OPEC
members,]{.mark}]{.underline} two sources told Reuters. Another source
said [[Riyadh has broached the subject with U.S.]{.mark} energy
[officials.]{.mark}]{.underline}

If the Saudis followed through, [[it would chip away at U.S.
influence]{.mark} over global financial markets [and]{.mark}
Washington's ability to enforce [sanctions on foreign
entities.]{.mark}]{.underline} Efforts to diminish the greenback's role
in oil trading have been fairly limited to date, but the Saudi plan
would lend significant momentum to those efforts --- and represent a
coup for countries like Russia and China.

Saudi Arabia is the world's largest oil exporter, and its total crude
output is surpassed only by U.S. and Russian production. [It pumps
enough oil to meet about 10 percent of global demand, while OPEC
fulfills about a third of global consumption.]{.underline}

["[The Saudis know they have the dollar as the nuclear
option,"]{.mark}]{.underline} one of the sources told Reuters.

The Saudi embassy in Washington did not immediately return CNBC's
request for comment. The Saudi energy ministry and U.S. Department of
Energy did not respond to Reuters. The State Department told Reuters it
does not comment on pending legislation.

The NOPEC legislation would amend existing U.S. law, allowing the
Justice Department to sue foreign countries for working together to
limit oil supplies and influence prices.

That represents an existential threat to OPEC. The 14-nation producer
group regulates global oil supply by setting output limits for each
member during times of oversupply.

Capping output pushes up the cost of crude. Since OPEC nations depend on
oil revenues to balance their budgets, the line between balancing the
market and filling domestic coffers has always been blurry.

Saudi government expenditure has been rising steadily: Oil expert

OPEC and a group of non-member allies led by Russia are currently trying
to keep 1.2 million barrels a day off the market through the first half
of 2018.

While some stakeholders --- including many U.S. drillers --- believe
OPEC is essential to keeping supply and demand in balance, others say
the group inflates prices to enrich its members at the expense of oil
consumers. That latter view is popular with both Democratic and
Republican lawmakers, who want to keep energy prices low for their
constituents.

"For decades, Saudi Arabia has benefited from trading its vast supplies
of cheap oil on an unfree market dominated by the OPEC cartel---at
American expense," said Robbie Diamond, president and CEO of Securing
America's Future Energy, a think tank that advocates for reducing U.S.
dependence on oil.

"[[This]{.mark} report,]{.underline} if true, [would only [further prove
that Saudi]{.mark} Arabi[a is willing to go to extreme lengths to
protect]{.mark} [it]{.mark}s unfair advantage [in]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
global [oil market]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}" Diamond said in a
statement.

#### Oil retaliation against currency would be likely and catastrophic

**Cunningham 4-7**-19 (Nick Cunningham is a freelance writer on oil and
gas, renewable energy, climate change, energy policy and geopolitics
\|\| Saudis Threaten \'Nuclear Option\] to Kill Petrodollar,
oilprice.com \|\|
https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Saudis-Threaten-Nuclear-Option-To-Kill-Petrodollar.html#)

[[Saudi Arabia threatened]{.mark} to use [the "nuclear option" of
undermining the]{.mark} petro-[dollar]{.mark}]{.underline} if the U.S.
moves forward with the NOPEC bill.

The U.S. Congress has been mulling legislation, known as the NOPEC bill,
which would allow the Justice Department to take antitrust action
against OPEC for manipulating the oil market. Specifically, the bill
would remove sovereign immunity countries have from such action,
allowing the U.S. government to sue. In theory, the law would prevent
OPEC from coordinating production cuts.

It's still unclear if the Congress will pass the bill, and it's also not
guaranteed that Trump will sign the bill if it reaches his desk.
Moreover, even if he did sign it, it's also not a done deal that the
Justice Department would take punitive action.

Nevertheless, Saudi Arabia clearly views the threat as a serious one.
Reuters reports that Saudi Arabia has threatened to sell its oil in
currencies other than the U.S. dollar if the bill becomes law. Such a
move would have enormous implications.

The global oil market is almost entirely conducted in dollars, which
provides the foundation for dollar domination in the global financial
system. Introducing new currencies in the oil trade could undercut
demand for the dollar, diminish American influence over global finance,
weaken American influence over sanctions, and thus, undercut its
geopolitical reach. It's hard to assess how serious Saudi Arabia is, but
the implications of such a move are far-reaching and hard to overstate.

"The Saudis know they have the dollar as the nuclear option," a source
familiar with the matter told Reuters. Another source put it this way:
"The Saudis say: let the Americans pass NOPEC and [[it would be the U.S.
economy that]{.mark} would [fall apart.]{.mark}"]{.underline}

Some version of the NOPEC legislation has floated around for years, but
past U.S. presidents from both parties have opposed the measure over
fears that it would damage the U.S.-Saudi relationship. This time
around, the situation is different, for several reasons. First, Saudi
Arabia has seriously damaged its standing in Washington through its war
in Yemen and over the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. With
goodwill evaporating, its grip on the U.S. Congress has weakened.

The House and Senate just passed a bill that cuts off U.S. aid for the
Saudi war in Yemen, a historic rebuke to Saudi Arabia as well as a
historic move to weaken the American executive branch's authority over
war. President Trump will likely veto the bill, but a few years ago,
such a vote was unthinkable. Saudi Arabia's missteps contributed greatly
to the passage of the bill.

Another reason why the odds of NOPEC becoming law are greater than ever
are because of the unpredictable nature of Trump himself. He has
embraced the Saudi government, but he also uses OPEC as a punching bag.
Although the Saudis, to a large degree, control OPEC decisions, they are
distinct entities in Trump's mind. Only a few days ago he tweeted: "Very
important that OPEC increase the flow of Oil. World Markets are fragile,
price of Oil getting too high. Thank you!"

To the extent that oil prices are high and Trump feels that gasoline
prices become a political liability, he may feel more compelled to sign
a NOPEC bill.

That brings us back to the Saudi threat to undermine the dollar. [[If
Riyadh]{.mark} actually [carried out]{.mark} such [a threat]{.mark} to
switch away from the dollar for oil sales]{.underline} -- which is
definitely not a sure thing -- [[it would have]{.mark} some [eager
partners. China, Russia, Iran and]{.mark} even [the E]{.mark}uropean
[U]{.mark}nion [have]{.mark} all at times [supported]{.mark} some
[alternative to the dollar-based international
order.]{.mark}]{.underline} The Trump administration's excessive use of
sanctions, and its bullying of key allies in Europe, have many
governments ready for currency substitutes.

As Reuters notes, [Russia has tried to sell oil in euros while China
setup a yuan-denominated oil contract in Shanghai to rival the dollar.
[Iran has]{.mark} also eagerly tried to [promote oil sales in other
currencies]{.mark} in order to skirt U.S. sanctions.]{.underline} The EU
setup a special purpose vehicle to help European companies continue to
do business with Iran, and it also recently set up a working group to
promote the euro as an alternative to the dollar.

To date, those efforts have done little to undercut dollar domination.
But [[a Saudi decision to diversify away]{.mark} from the dollar [would
be the most powerful move]{.mark} yet.]{.underline}

However, there are plenty of reasons why this scenario won't play out.
The bill may not pass the U.S. Congress to begin with. But even if it
became law, the Saudis have plenty of obstacles standing in their way,
not the least of which is their currency peg with the dollar. Riyadh is
also dependent on the U.S. military alliance, and dumping the dollar
would put that in jeopardy. Those reasons alone might deter Saudi Arabia
from moving forward with currency alternatives.

A separate threat, which is arguably more doable from the Saudi
standpoint, would be to produce oil at maximum levels to crash prices.
OPEC officials have reportedly been telling Wall Street executives that
they would be forced to take such action if the NOPEC bill becomes law.
"NOPEC legislation won't serve the U.S. interest," OPEC Secretary
General Mohammad Barkindo said in March in Houston at the CERAWeek
Conference.

#### Saudi Arabia will only use the U.S. dollar if it's in their interest

Services industry, and the director of the non-profit organization,
Voluntaryism in Action. He graduated from Middle Georgia State
University with a degree in Business Administration. \"The
Petrodollar\'s Influence On US Foreign Policy - Eccentric
Economics\"https://beinglibertarian.com/petrodollars-influence-us-foreign-policy/

There is a considerable chance you have heard that the US government
invades countries and steals their oil, and the resource being a driving
factor in our foreign policy. This is somewhat correct. Although it may
be on a smaller and hushed scale, the government isn't necessarily
invading countries, stealing their oil and proceeding to ship barrels of
it back home. One may counter that the US invades countries that are
rich in oil, and then maintains an influential presence and places
powerful US companies there to conduct the export of the valuable
resource, and this is a fair assumption. However, the US government's
presence in the Middle East isn't necessarily to appropriate oil, rather
ensure the longevity of the *petrodollar*. The petrodollar's dawn dates
back to the 1940s, particularly after WW2. At the Bretton Woods
Conference in 1944, the US dollar was established as the world's reserve
currency. The biggest takeaway from the conference was that since the US
held most of the world's gold, it promised to redeem gold to countries
in exchange for US dollars. In 1945, President Franklin D. Roosevelt met
with the King of Saudi Arabia and formalized an alliance. This cemented
a relationship between the dollar and oil, though its marriage would not
be knitted until decades later. Excessive spending in the 1960s on
various government programs and the Federal Reserve's manipulation
caused excess dollars to circulate the international economic
environment, predictably decreasing its value. This made other countries
exchange their dollars for gold at a faster rate, most notably Britain
in the early 1970s. To stop the drain, Nixon removed the US dollar from
the gold standard and defaulted on its promise to redeem gold for
dollars, which in turn informally ended the Bretton Woods agreement.
Since the dollar was no longer redeemable in gold nor backed by any
substance of value, countries had no incentive to continue utilizing the
dollar as the world reserve currency. The Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) began discussing accepting payments other
than the US dollar, including gold. After removing the US dollar from
the gold standard and inciting a shock and widespread inflation, coupled
with another shock induced by OPEC's embargo on nations supporting
Israel, the US needed a resolution that would attract countries to keep
the dollar as their reserve. With Saudi Arabia being one of the most
prominent and powerful members of OPEC, they and the US strengthened
their economic alliance in an agreement known as the United States-Saudi
Arabian Joint Commission on Economic Cooperation. With Saudi Arabian
influence, OPEC agreed to use US dollars for oil contracts, and would
then recycle the US dollars back to the US. In exchange, the US promised
to keep the House of Saud in power to ensure the US dollar would be
utilized for oil trade. This agreement officially gave birth to the
petrodollar. Concisely, [[an important factor of the US dollar's value
is its dependency on oil trade]{.mark} and the currency being exchanged
between exporting and importing nations.]{.underline} It should be
noted, even if the US isn't involved in trade between paticular nations,
they use US dollars to purchase the oil. [This creates an **artificial
demand** for the US dollar.]{.underline} It is a medium of exchange
backed by virtually nothing, with its value being derived from its
exchange utility and, of course, debt. [[The US dollar is a global
currency, and the vast majority of international transactions are priced
in US dollars]{.underline}]{.mark}. Therefore, oil-exporting countries
receive revenue in US dollars. Due to its widespread use, the national
income of many oil-exporting nations is dependent upon the value of the
dollar. With the historic market volatility of oil prices, countries
that are dependent on the exportation of oil peg their currency to the
US dollar, and do this in the instance the value of the dollar falls,
making all of their goods and services in their economies fall to
prevent damaging inflation or deflation. In due time, oil-exporting
nations began branching out to ensure their economies did not depend
solely on oil and thus experience the dreaded Dutch disease. These
nations began to recycle their US dollars through sovereign wealth
funds, which are invested into non-oil-related ventures essentially
making them less dependent on oil. To the alarm of the US, 70% of the
700 billion investable reserve funds are untraceable. If it is invested
in US treasury bonds, a mass withdrawal could destabilize the dollar.
Most countries won't attempt this, however, since the US is one of
OPEC's biggest customers. However, countries that refuse to use or
attempt to discard the petrodollar for international trade make trade
agreements with one another, using their preferred currencies instead of
the petrodollar. Some of examples of these countries are Russia, Iran
and Venezuela. A notable nation that faced repercussions and military
actions for its attempt to use gold instead of US dollars was Libya.
Conclusively, the US dollar relies heavily, but not exclusively, on its
use as a medium of international exchange, and it is vital nations play
along and continue to utilize it. The history of the petrodollar offers
a convincing explanation of why the US is consistently involved in
Middle Eastern affairs. [[It must continue to satisfy Saudi Arabian
interests to ensure they continue to use the US dollar,]{.mark} and
install governments and regimes in nations that will employ the
petrodollar to ensure the currency's longevity.]{.underline}

### AT Won't Retal - Yes Alternatives

#### **A convergence of other factors means the plan tips everything over the brink**

**Paul '18** (1/29/18, Ron Paul \|\| Ron Paul is a former member of
Congress and Distinguished Counselor to the Mises Institute\|\| A
Growing List of Threats to the Dollar, Mises Institute
\|\|https://mises.org/power-market/growing-list-threats-dollar)

Last week the Senate confirmed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Chairman
by a vote of 84-13. This is in contrast to the contentious debates and
closer votes over Janet Yellen's confirmation in 2014 and Ben Bernanke's
confirmation for a second term in 2010. Powell benefited from a
perception that the economy's recovery from the 2007-08 meltdown proves
that the Fed is a capable manager of monetary policy. However, the
perceptions of economic recovery and Federal Reserve competence are both
far from the truth.

The economy may seem to have recovered, [but the [recovery is
not]{.mark} built on a [firm]{.mark} foundation]{.underline}. Instead it
rests on Fed-created bubbles in areas such as automobile sales, credit
cards debt, student loan debt, stocks, and even a new housing bubble.
[The most [dangerous]{.mark} bubble [is the government debt
bubble.]{.mark}]{.underline} The Fed facilitates deficit spending by
monetizing the federal debt. The desire to enable Congress' spending
addiction is a major reason why the Fed cannot significantly raise
interest rates, as increasing rates could increase federal debt payments
to unsustainable levels. This may be one reason why President Trump has
reversed course and endorsed low interest rates. Of course, all
first-term presidents want low interest rates since they believe the low
rates boost the economy and thus help them win reelection.

One of the issues Powell will face is increasing challenges to the
dollar's world reserve currency status. [[China is pressuring
Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [to **price oil in**]{.mark} Chinese [**yuan**
instead of]{.mark} in American **[dollars.]{.mark}** China and [other
countries]{.mark} may [take]{.mark} other [steps, such as halting
purchases of Treasury bonds, that]{.mark} could [weaken the
dollar.]{.mark}]{.underline} [The [threats to the dollar]{.mark}'s world
reserve currency status [will increase as concerns about US
government]{.mark} and [private sector debt]{.mark}, as well as
resentment over US [militarism and protectionism,
grow.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The dollar still maintains its reserve currency status not because the
dollar is strong, but because other countries' currencies are weak.
However, [unless the US gets its economic house in order, that may not
long be the case.]{.underline}

A new challenge to the dollar's status is emerging from the private
sector as [[more individuals seek alt]{.mark}ernative[s to]{.mark}
[government-created fiat currency.]{.mark}]{.underline} The dramatic
increase in the value of bitcoins may very well be another Fed-created
bubble, but it is one fueled in part by desire to be free of the Fed's
ever-depreciating paper dollars.

[[Another sign]{.mark} of the people's rejection of the Fed [is the
passage of state laws recognizing gold and silver]{.mark} as legal
tender. [Arizona]{.mark} passed such a law last year [and
Wyoming]{.mark} will soon consider a similar bill.]{.underline} As the
failure of our current system becomes more apparent, more states will
give their citizens freedom from the Fed's money monopoly.

Much to new Fed Chairman Powell's chagrin, support for the Audit the Fed
bill remains high. As knowledge of how the Fed endangers prosperity
grows, the pressure on Congress to pass Audit the Fed will prove
irresistible.

Jerome Powell may seem to be assuming the Fed chairmanship at a time of
increasing prosperity and renewed respect for the Fed. However, the
prosperity is an illusion built on a series of Fed-created bubbles whose
bursting will cause a major economic downturn. This will increase both
the growing challenges to the dollar's world reserve currency status and
the number of people seeking alternatives to Federal Reserve-created
fiat currency. [Powell could be the last Fed chairman if the next
Fed-created economic crisis leads the people to force Congress to audit
and then end the Fed.]{.underline}

#### Saudi is incentivized to retaliate with the assurances of other partners, like Russia and China---that turns case on Russian expansionism

**Turak '18** (10/23/18, Natasha Turak \|\| Natasha Turak is a
correspondent for CNBC, with areas of focus in foreign direct
investment, emerging markets, commodities, geopolitics, economic
development and geopolitical risk \|\| Threats of US sanctions could
accelerate a Saudi shift eastward, CNBC

As the fallout over the killing of Saudi journalist and U.S. resident
Jamal Khashoggi continues, age-old alliances are being tested.

In contradiction to President Donald Trump, who has voiced opposition to
any interference in U.S. weapons sales to Saudi Arabia, members of
Congress are openly calling for sanctions on America's number one arms
customer.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday announced a hold on arms sales
to the kingdom for the time being, a move lauded by many in the
international community. [But some now fear that [severing arms sales to
the Saudis will]{.mark} simply [push them]{.mark} to turn
[eastward.]{.mark}]{.underline}

["If the U.S. and West in general move toward some meaningful sanctions
of Saudi Arabia, we would be joking to imagine that the Saudis would
just sit down and accept it,]{.underline}" Ayham Kamel, head of Eurasia
Group's Middle East and North Africa practice, told CNBC's "Squawk Box
Europe" Monday.

"The Saudis I think will begin to tilt --- they were already doing that
beforehand --- they'll be doing more business with China and Russia. I
doubt Mr. Putin would've given the Saudis much trouble with this crisis
as Mr. Trump has."

Testing ties

Khashoggi, a columnist for the Washington Post and frequent critic of
the Saudi royal family, disappeared after entering the Saudi consulate
in Istanbul on October 2. Turkish officials allege he was murdered and
dismembered by a Saudi hit squad. After initially insisting that
Khashoggi left the consulate unharmed, the Saudi government last week
said that he died in a "fistfight" while in the building, but provided
few details and no evidence. Multiple investigations are underway.

The scandal has prompted scores of ministers and CEOs to withdraw from a
major international summit being held this week in Riyadh, aimed at
showcasing Saudi Arabia's investment opportunities. But while U.S.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has pulled out along with heavyweight
American CEOs like Jamie Dimon and Larry Fink, the heads of Russia's
direct investment fund (RDIF) will still be in attendance.

An opportunity for Russia and China?

[[Saudi Arabia has]{.mark} already [been increasing business with the
Russians and]{.mark} the [Chinese.]{.mark} In June, Vladimir [Putin
hosted]{.mark} [Saudi]{.mark} Crown Prince at the Kremlin, [where the
two agreed to "expand cooperation in oil]{.mark} and gas
[matters"]{.mark} after working together on output deals to stabilize
markets amid fluctuating global crude prices.]{.underline}

And October of last year saw the first-ever visit of a Saudi monarch ---
King Salman --- to Russia, during which a \$1 billion joint investment
fund was created and 15 cooperation agreements were signed in the areas
of technology, defense and agriculture, including Moscow's readiness to
sell Riyadh its S-400 missile defense system.

[[China,]{.mark} meanwhile, [is the kingdom's largest trading
partner,]{.mark} with \$42 billion in bilateral trade in 2017. Last
March, the two signed a raft of deals worth a reported \$65 billion in
sectors ranging from energy to space technology]{.underline}. [Some in
[Riyadh have also **talked of trading oil in yuan instead of dollars**
as **retaliation** for]{.mark} potential [U.S.]{.mark}
**[sanctions]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

But as trade tensions with the U.S. continue to put strain on China's
economy, it is likely to lay low at this stage to avoid further conflict
with the U.S. administration. Additionally, China is far from able to
match U.S. weapons production in terms of sophistication and
capabilities, defense experts say. Beijing sold just \$20 million in
arms to the Saudis last year, compared to \$3.4 billion in exports from
the U.S., according to the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute.

Riyadh's increasing engagement with eastern power centers is not
necessarily new, but this diplomatic crisis could spur its acceleration,
according to Saman Vakil, a research fellow at U.K. think tank Chatham
House and a professor at Johns Hopkins' School of Advanced International
Studies.

[["In Riyadh,]{.mark} diversification of relationships and not putting
all their eggs in Washington's basket has been a longstanding
policy,"]{.underline} Vakil told CNBC, describing energy deals with
China dating back to the 1990s. "And it could be in their continued
interest, because if there are forthcoming sanctions from the EU or the
U.S. on human rights issues, obviously [[China's policy of
non-interference would make sense]{.mark} for them,
[strategically]{.mark} speaking."]{.underline}

Still, the nearly 90-year-old alliance --- deemed a "special
relationship" when diplomatic ties were first established in 1933 ---
remains paramount to the kingdom's stability, something Riyadh knows
very well.

"A break with the U.S., any obvious rupture in the relationship is also
not in their interest," Vakil added. "So they're going to try to
maintain these three different portfolios."

"The House of Saud would be much weaker without U.S. support," said
Eurasia Group's Kamel, acknowledging Washington's decades of military
and diplomatic backing.

But would it collapse? "Not necessarily immediately," the analyst said.
"But it would certainly be much weaker than it is today."

[[China]{.mark} (the largest holder of U.S. debt) is the largest
importer of oil, while [Russia]{.mark}, one of the largest exporters of
oil in the world [have agreed to use the petro-Yuan to bypass the
petro-dollar]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The petro-Yuan]{.mark}
[threatens]{.mark} the U.S. [dollar]{.mark}'s [heg]{.mark}emony around
the globe as [several nations]{.mark} have recently demonstrated as they
all [share an interest in joining the transition]{.mark} from the U.S.
dollar [to the Yuan]{.mark} for oil transactions [including]{.mark}
Washington's arch enemies [Iran, Venezuela and]{.mark} even
[Indonesia]{.mark} (currently not on Washington's hit
list).]{.underline}

The mainstream-media has been reporting on the latest developments
concerning China's plan to bypass the dollar and introduce the
petro-Yuan to the international community in an article by CNBC titled
'China has grand ambitions to dethrone the dollar. It may make a
powerful move this year':

[[China is looking to make a major move]{.mark} against the dollar's
global dominance]{.underline}, and it may come as early as this year.
The new strategy is to enlist the energy markets' help: Beijing may
introduce a new way to price oil in coming months --- but unlike the
contracts based on the U.S. dollar that currently dominate global
markets, this benchmark would use China's own currency. If there's
widespread adoption, as the Chinese hope, then that will mark a step
toward challenging the greenback's status as the world's most powerful
currency.

China is the world's top oil importer, and so Beijing sees it as only
logical that its own currency should price the global economy's most
important commodity. [But beyond that, [moving away from the dollar is
a]{.mark} strategic [priority for]{.mark} countries like [China and
Russia. Both aim to]{.mark} ultimately [reduce their]{.mark} dependency
on the greenback, limiting their [exposure to U.S. currency risk
and]{.mark} the politics of [American sanctions]{.mark}
regimes]{.underline}

Washington is on a collision course for another war with North Korea
with U.S. President Donald Trump leading the charge. [With the power of
the U.S. dollar on life support, the U.S. empire of debt continues to
use the threat of war and in some cases, wage actual wars around the
world namely Iran, Syria and Venezuela which have been on Washington's
hit list for some time. Iran and Russia are already slowly transitioning
away from the U.S. dollar to avoid any future economic sanctions imposed
by Washington.]{.underline} Venezuela is also ready and willing to make
its move against the U.S. dollar. Reuters did report on the decision
made by the Maduro government to implement a new system of international
payments for its oil exports. The report headlined with 'Venezuela's
Maduro says will shun U.S. dollar in favor of yuan, others' quoted what
Maduro had said during a session of the National Constituent Assembly at
Palacio Federal Legislativo in Caracas, Venezuela:

"Venezuela is going to implement a new system of international payments
and will create a basket of currencies to free us from the dollar,"
Maduro said in an hours-long address to a new legislative superbody,
without providing details of the new mechanism. [["If they pursue us
with the dollar, we'll use the]{.mark} Russian [ruble, the yuan, yen,
the]{.mark} Indian [rupee, the euro,"]{.mark} Maduro said]{.underline}

Another recent article published by CNBC 'China will 'compel' Saudi
Arabia to trade oil in Yuan --- and that's going to affect the US
dollar' interviewed Carl Weinberg a chief economist and a managing
director at High Frequency Economics about how the US dollar will lose
its global dominance in the near future once Saudi Arabia will be forced
to use the petro-Yuan since China is the world's top importer of oil:

Carl Weinberg, chief economist and managing director, said Beijing
stands to become the most dominant global player in oil demand since
China usurped the U.S. as the "biggest oil importer on the planet."

[Saudi Arabia has "to pay attention to this because even as much as one
or two years from now, [Chinese demand will dwarf U.S. demand,]{.mark}"
Weinberg said. "I believe that [yuan pricing of oil is coming and
as]{.mark} soon as [the Saudis move to accept it --- **as the Chinese
will compel them to do**]{.mark} --- then [the rest of the oil market
will move along with them"]{.mark}]{.underline}

The U.S. dollar is slowly losing its' status as the world's reserve
currency, so is a war with China a possibility? Would the U.S. attack
North Korea as a stern warning to China or would it bring China into the
conflict in an attempt to save the U.S. dollar? Saddam Hussein wanted to
trade in Euro's instead of the U.S. dollar for Iraq's oil exports and
Libya's Muammar Gaddafi wanted the Gold Dinar to dethrone the U.S.
dollar in the continent of Africa. The decisions made by both Iraq and
Libya had consequences that led to their destruction by U.S. and NATO
forces. Can the U.S. do the same to China? I highly doubt it since China
has a formidable military that can defend itself against any U.S.
attack. China is certainly not Iraq nor Libya. So will there be a war
against China in the long term? With the U.S. steadily collapsing at a
slow pace, Washington would do anything to survive. The U.S. dollar
supports the Military-Industrial Complex and its destructive and very
expensive adventures around the world.

[[The launch of the petro-Yuan will accelerate]{.mark} the process in
what we can call [De-Dollarization.]{.mark}]{.underline} However, there
are some people in the mainstream-media that are not convinced that the
petro-Yuan will overthrow the U.S. dollar anytime soon, for instance,
David Fickling from Bloomberg News recently wrote 'The Petroyuans time
hasn't come' said:

Look, for instance, at the most-traded product on the Dalian Commodity
Exchange in China, iron ore. While mainland commodity markets have seen
febrile activity in recent years, bid-ask spreads are still several
times higher than those on major contracts traded in London and New
York. That makes trading more costly, volatility higher, and price
discovery weaker --- and as a major consumer of crude, Beijing ought to
be opposed to that sort of change.

#### The plan turns Saudi Arabia into one of our rivals and incentivizes a switch from the dollar---the only reason it hasn't yet is because of strong ties with the US

**Wearden '09** (10/6/09, Graeme Wearden \|\| Wearden tracks the latest
world business, economic and financial news in our daily liveblog.

rivals \'plotting to end oil trading in dollars,\' The Guardian
\|\|https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/oct/06/oil-us-dollar-threat-to-america)

[[China, Russia, Japan and]{.mark} several of the most powerful [Gulf
States are]{.mark} actively [plotting to end]{.mark} the decades-old
practice of buying and [selling oil in dollars,]{.mark} the Independent
claimed today.]{.underline}

The newspaper said [[the plan is for]{.mark} the [US currency to be
replaced]{.mark} for trading oil [by]{.mark} a basket of currencies,
including the Japanese yen, the Chinese yuan, the euro, gold and
[a]{.mark} new, [single currency for the Gulf
states.]{.mark}]{.underline} If executed[, [the move would be
a]{.underline}]{.mark} [significant [blow to the dollar]{.mark}\'s
position as the premier world currency [and]{.mark} would potentially
[threaten America]{.mark}\'s position as the world\'s leading
economy.]{.underline}

According to the Independent, gold could be used as a temporary
replacement for the dollar while the new currency basket was
implemented.

\"Secret meetings have already been held by finance ministers and
central bank governors in Russia, China, Japan and Brazil to work on the
scheme, which will mean that oil will no longer be priced in dollars,\"
it claimed.

\"Chinese financial sources believe President Barack Obama is too busy
fixing the US economy to concentrate on the extraordinary implications
of the transition from the dollar in nine years\' time. The current
deadline for the currency transition is 2018,\" added.

[[The dollar fell by]{.mark} around [0.4%]{.mark} against a basket of
other currencies following the report. [This pushed gold to]{.mark}
[a]{.mark} new all-time [high of \$1,035]{.mark} per ounce.]{.underline}

The report was swiftly denied by several of the world\'s biggest oil
producers. Muhammad al-Jasser, head of the Saudi Arabian central bank,
claimed it was \"absolutely incorrect\", while Russian finance minister
Dmitry Pankin and a Kuwaiti oil minister both denied discussing a move
away from the dollar.

A source within the United Arab Emirates central bank also told Reuters
that it would be sticking with the greenback.

A flawed system?

But analysts believe that the dollar\'s long-term future as the currency
for oil trading is indeed in doubt.

[\"China, Russia and many [Middle East countries]{.mark} already [have
large dollar reserves.]{.mark} [They want to]{.mark} stop them getting
higher, and may even want to star[t diversify]{.mark}ing them [into
other currencies,]{.mark}]{.underline}[\"]{.mark} pointed out David
Hart, oil and gas analyst at investment bank Hanson Westhouse.

For years, economists have speculated about how long oil would continue
to be traded in dollars. Critics argue that the current system is
flawed; oil importers are forced to buy dollars to pay for their fuel,
while exporters are left with billions of dollars which they often hold
in reserve or reinvest in the US economy. The result, they say, is that
the dollar\'s position as the global reserve currency is reinforced.
Thus, the US economy is supported as any devaluation would cause damage
across the world. Most of China\'s \$2tn (£1.24tn) of foreign currency
reserves are in dollars, for example.

Hart said that it is inevitable that the dollar\'s dominance over the
oil market will be broken eventually, possibly sooner than 2018. He
believes the transition would happen slowly, rather than a sudden
switch.

\"Let\'s face it, bilateral trade between China and these other
countries is growing, so you can see why there is interest in matching
up the currencies,\" said Hart. [\"If China and Russia are trading oil,
why would they want to do that solely in dollars?\"]{.underline}

[[Beijing has started putting strong pressure on Riyadh to]{.mark} start
[accepting yuan payments for oil instead of dollars,]{.mark} as are
other countries such as the Russian Federation.]{.underline} For Riyadh,
this is an almost existential issue. [[Riyadh is in a delicate
situation,]{.underline}]{.mark} dedicated as it is to keeping the US
dollar tied to oil, even though its main ally, the US, has pursued in
the Middle East a contradictory strategy, as seen with the JCPOA
agreement. Iran, the main regional enemy of Saudi Arabia, was able to
have sanctions lifted (especially from Europeans countries) thanks to
the JCPOA. In addition, Iran was able to pursue a historic victory with
its allies in Syria, gaining a preeminent role in the region and
aspiring to become a regional powerhouse. [[Riyadh is obliged to obey
the US,]{.mark} an ally that does not care about its fate in the region
(Iran is increasingly influential in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon) and is
even competing in the oil market.]{.underline} To make matters worse for
Washington[, [China is Riyadh's largest customer;]{.mark} and
considering the agreements with Nigeria and Russia, [Beijing can]{.mark}
safely [stop]{.mark} buying oil from Saudi Arabia [should Riyadh
continue to insist on]{.mark} receiving payment only in
[dollars.]{.mark} This would badly hurt the petrodollar, a perverse
system that damages China and Russia most of all.]{.underline}

For China, Iran and Russia, as well as other countries[,
de-dollarization has become a pressing issue. The number of countries
that are beginning to see the benefits of a decentralized system, as
opposed to the US dollar system, is increasing. [Iran]{.mark} and
[India,]{.mark} but also Iran and [Russia,]{.mark} [have]{.mark} often
traded hydrocarbons in exchange for primary goods, thereby [bypassing
American sanctions.]{.mark}]{.underline} Likewise, China\'s economic
power has allowed it to open a 10-billion-euro line of credit to Iran to
circumvent recent sanctions. Even the DPRK seems to use cryptocurrencies
like bitcoin to buy oil from China and bypass US sanctions.
[[Venezuela]{.mark} (with the largest oil reserves in the world)
[has]{.mark} just started a historic move to [completely renounce
selling oil in dollars,]{.mark}]{.underline} and has announced that it
will start receiving money in a basket of currencies without US dollars.
(This is not to mention the biggest change to have occurred in the last
40 years). [Beijing will buy gas and oil from Russia by paying in
yuan,]{.underline} with Moscow being able to convert yuan into gold
immediately thanks to the Shanghai International Energy Exchange. [This
[gas-yuan-gold mechanism signals a revolutionary]{.mark} economic
[change through the]{.mark} progressive [abandonment of the
dollar]{.mark} in trade.]{.underline}

#### **Trump administration actions are pushing China and Saudi Arabia together---unique convergence of factors means the plan guarantees Saudi retaliation**

Political Review \|\| The Worrisom Deal: China and Saudi Arabia, Harvard
Political Review \|\|
https://harvardpolitics.com/world/the-worrisome-deal-china-and-saudi-arabia/)

In the end[, [the linchpin of this]{.mark} relationship [is **Saudi
Arabia's confidence** in the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}
dollar, as it indicates the weight of the Saudi's trade surplus power.
If these conditions are fulfilled, any cheating or straying from Saudi
Arabia's under-the-table agreement would be illogical and detrimental.
However, the United States' continuing trade and fiscal deficits are
weakening the dollar and Saudi petrodollar holdings. [Combine this with
the unforeseen rise of China and conciliatory actions by China towards
Saudi Arabia, and the United State's petrodollar is in obvious
trouble.]{.underline}

Earlier this year, [the [Chinese Ambassador]{.mark} Li [Huaxin]{.mark}
was pictured with Saudi officials as he [praised]{.mark} [Saudi Arabia's
Vision 2030,]{.mark} [which]{.mark} calls for stronger economic
cooperation between the two nations. This pact [pressures Saudi Arabia
to **adopt the "petro-yuan,"**]{.mark} which would effectively axe the
petrodollar.]{.underline} Although Saudi Arabia relies heavily on U.S.
military power, Saudi Arabia warming ties with China closeness are
alarming. China's growing economy and standing in the world could
undermine the attitude towards the United States. [Above anything else,
[a shift in **alliances** could **threaten America**]{.mark}'s standing
in the Middle East and world.]{.underline}

The prospective decline of American power through the destabilization of
the petrodollar could disrupt a balance of power that has ensured
relative world peace since the Cold War. A weak US economy would leave
the nation with a weaker and drive a new dual-hegemony between Russia
and China, who signed an Eurasian Economic Cooperation pact on May 17th
in Astana. As Russia continues to "heat" Europe through its natural gas
reserves, which are not sold via the dollar, taking global energy off
the dollar -- by taking it off of oil altogether -- is a future
possibility.

In the last few months, the United States' reaction to the Chinese-Saudi
Arabia negotiations have been rather quiet with little report to no
media attention . With President Trump's continued rhetoric and talk, it
is clear that tariffs and a trade war will be of continual focus, at
least much more relative to the possible attack at the petrodollar, and
indirectly, at inflation in the United States.

Time will tell if President Trump continues with the United States'
historic and desperate protectionism of the petrodollar. However[, as
other nations like China and Russia rise to power, America should be
weary of confrontation in this region]{.underline}. In the end, America
has an interesting competitive advantage in its petrodollar deal with
regional powers like Saudi Arabia. [A final wild card--better energy
technology and natural gas, especially from Russia and Iran--can weaken
OPEC supremacy over the oil market, and thus the
petrodollar.]{.underline} However[, this is not as dangerous as [Chinese
intervention]{.mark} into [crushing the
petrodollar.]{.mark}]{.underline} Nevertheless, with a trade war
ensuing, a new battle is in the horizon and time will tell what happens.

### AT Won't Retal - Arms Key

#### Saudi Arabia's number one priority is arms---strong relations now with the US proves---the plan is [more likely]{.underline} than OPEC to trigger the link

**Hennigan '18** (10/18/18, W.J. Hennigan \|\| W.J. Hennigan covers the
Pentagon and national security issues in Washington DC, worked for more

so Special? Weapons, Oil, and \'An Army of Lobbyists,\' TIME
\|\|https://time.com/5428669/saudi-arabia-military-relationship/)

It's a cold financial calculation: Saudi money for U.S.-made weaponry
results in American jobs.

This is President Donald Trump's rationale in dismissing calls in
Congress to halt future arms sales to Saudi Arabia following the
mysterious disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi journalist and
American resident.

"I don't like the concept of stopping an investment of \$110 billion
into the United States," Trump said last week.

"All they're going to do is say, 'That's OK. We don't have to buy it
from Boeing. We don't have to buy it from Lockheed. We don't have to buy
it from Raytheon and all these great companies. We'll buy it from
Russia. We'll buy it from China," he said.

[[The 75-year alliance]{.mark} between the two nations [has been built
on]{.mark} a simple arrangement: American demand for Saudi oil and
[Saudi demand for American firepower.]{.mark}]{.underline}

It is a relationship that is not easily unwound as a bipartisan group of
U.S. Senators found out earlier this year when they moved to cut off
military assistance to the Saudis in their war against Houthi rebels in
Yemen. The United Nations has said that more half of the more than
10,000 people who have been killed in the three-year old war are
civilians, and the lives of millions are potentially at risk from
famine.

The U.S. government has provided intelligence, munitions and midair
refueling to Saudi warplanes since operations kicked off in 2015.
Attempts by American lawmakers to stop that aid have thus far failed.

Saudi Arabia has spent at least \$5.8 million on lobbying Congress this
year, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics,
a government watchdog. But recently filed documents detailing expenses
and reimbursements put the actual number closer to \$9 million, said
Lydia Dennett, investigator with the Project on Government Oversight.

[["The Kingdom has a]{.mark} veritable [army of lobbyists]{.mark} and PR
firms [working to promote their interests]{.mark} in a wide variety of
ways," she said.]{.underline}

The Foreign Influence Transparency Initiative, a left-leaning think tank
in Washington, recently compiled records filed under Foreign Agents
Registration Act that show in 2017 Saudi lobbyists contacted over 200
members of Congress, including every Senator. The data also found the
Saudi agents contacted officials in the State Department, which oversees
foreign military sales, nearly 100 times.

[The Saudi-U.S. relationship is peerless [when it comes to arms sales.
The kingdom buys more]{.mark} American weapons [than any other]{.mark}
nation.]{.underline} Saudi Arabia accounted for nearly one-fifth of
American of all weapons exports over the past five years, according to a
recent report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

The Pentagon has a team of U.S. service members based out of the capital
Riyadh wholly dedicated the "management and administration of Saudi
Arabian Foreign Military Sales." It serves as a direct pipeline to move
weapons from U.S. arms manufacturers into the arms of the Saudi
military.

The U.S. military's Joint Advisory Division works alongside commanders
in each branch of the Saudi military to help fill their weapons needs.
Once the Saudis commit to what they want --- tanks, attack helicopters,
missiles, ships, laser-guided bombs --- the arms packages must be OK'd
by the U.S. Defense and State Departments, and approved by Congress.

The arrangement falls under the U.S. Military Training Mission to Saudi
Arabia, which is led by a two-star American general. The mission is
primarily designed to bolster Saudi Arabia against arch-rival Iran in
order to assert power and influence in the Middle East.

"We have other very good allies in the Middle East, but if you look at
Saudi Arabia: They're an ally and they're a tremendous purchaser of not
only military equipment, but other things," Trump said Wednesday in the
Oval Office.

[It was the [Presiden]{.mark}t's latest [attempt to trumpet \$400
billion]{.mark} [in]{.mark} business [deals]{.mark} that his
administration signed in May 2017 during a two-day visit to Saudi
Arabia.]{.underline} The eye-popping figure includes \$110 billion in
military sales, which analysts point out is misleading because it
represented letters of interest and not firmed-up contracts.

Saudi Arabia has thus far only committed to purchase \$14.5
billion-worth of equipment since the announcement was made 17 months
ago. [The Administration says the [Saudis are]{.mark} currently
[pursuing more than \$114 billion]{.mark} in military
hardware.]{.underline}

But even if the kingdom moves forward with the sales, the transactions
wouldn't be worth it, according to William D. Hartung, director of the
arms and security project at the Center for International Policy. "Jobs
are no excuse for arming a regime with Saudi Arabia's dismal human
rights record, whether it is its role in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi
or its indiscriminate bombing of civilians in Yemen," he said.

The Khashoggi case has caused an escalating debate on Capitol Hill over
the U.S.-Saudi relationship. Lawmakers on both sides have called for a
reappraisal if the kingdom is found responsible for Khashoggi's
disappearance or death.

James Carafano, a vice president at the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative think tank, says it's critical that Washington doesn't rush
policy changes on such an enduring alliance until the facts are clear.
"This isn't an episode of 'Law & Order.' This is a murder investigation
and a murder investigation takes a lot of time," he said.

The Trump Administration has repeatedly called for patience. On
Thursday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters outside the
White House that the U.S. will give Saudi Arabia a "few more days" to
"conduct a complete, thorough investigation."

"We're all going to get to see the response from Saudi Arabia to this,"
he said. "When we see that, we'll get a chance to determine---all of us
will get a chance to make a determination as to the credibility of the
work that went into that, whether it's truly accurate, fair, and
transparent in the very way they made a personal commitment to me, and
ultimately made a personal commitment to the president when they spoke
to him."

Before taking the short walk back into the White House, he added that
Saudi Arabia was also "an important strategic alliance of the United
States. We need to be mindful of that as well."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4223468-decline-fall-petrodollar

There are several studies on how the petrodollar system functions, and
the IMF has article after article about how the flow of petrodollars
influences the global economy. The collapse of the petrodollar has been
examined in detail in the [economic collapse
blog](http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/tag/petrodollar). What
is clear and should be taken into account by investors is [that the US
by virtue of the dollar being the dominant global reserve currency and
the most-traded currency in Forex markets enjoys a special
status.]{.underline} The US can have huge balance of trade deficits and
still have a currency that is in demand. Practically [the US exports
dollars to keep the global economy supplied with liquidity, and a good
part of the demand for dollars is due to the oil markets]{.underline}
because oil is [the most important
commodity](http://www.visualcapitalist.com/size-oil-market/) traded
internationally. Recent developments indicate that US dollar global
dominance is going to be challenged. Russia has built up a system for
payments that bypasses the US dollar, and China and Russia have set up
payment systems that do not require dollars. This is a recent new
development. Iraq and Iran are in discussions to avoid the US dollar and
Euro for oil transactions. The EU has so far only voiced interest in
setting up a payment system that does not require dollars. It is quite
possible that the US dollar will further increase in value in the short
term due to economic conditions, but the long-term prospect for the
dollar is negative. One reason for this is that the US has taken on far
more debt than it should have. The current federal projected budget
deficit for 2019 is over one trillion. That will be added to the current
debt level that is over 21.7 trillion and still rising. Take a look at
the [debt clock](http://www.usdebtclock.org/). As mentioned above the
trade balance is deep in the red and has been for some time. The reason
why this is so and the dollar can still keep its value is that the
demand for dollars is slackening off at a slow pace as the US provides
liquidity for the global economic system. China holds over one trillion
dollars of US securities and thus finds itself in the embarrassing
situation of planning to promote the renminbi as the most important
global reserve currency while not wanting to lose substantial amounts of
money because of the falling value of the US dollar. The PBoC also
insists on regulating the outflow of money and so far the renminbi has
not fully penetrated the global Forex market. [[The role of Saudi Arabia
is a key one in the oil business]{.mark}, and investors should pay
attention if the Saudis decide to accept currencies other than US
dollars as payment for crude oil.]{.underline} Once Saudi Arabia frees
itself from the petrodollar strait jacket, other countries may do the
same with a consequent diminution of demand for US dollars. The
agreement that Saudi Arabia entered into with Russia to buy the S-400
anti-missile system is an indication that the Saudis have established
close ties with the Russians. [[The proposal of blocking US arms sales
to Saudi Arabia is a symptom that [US-Saudi
relations](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/with-sanctions-and-banned-arms-sales-bipartisan-senate-group-tries-to-bring-an-end-to-yemen-war/2018/11/15/1b439fec-e91e-11e8-bbdb-72fdbf9d4fed_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.d1685f76607c)
are not what they used to be.]{.mark} [This is a new development and
bodes ill for the future of the petrodollar.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### AT Won't Retal - 1973 Deal

#### The plan would break 1973 petro-dollar deal with Saudi that was based on the dollar

LEG NUMBER 1: THE PETRODOLLARS BEGINNING AND DEMISE

I. The Beginning

The date was 1971 when Richard Nixon announced that America would not be
able to meet their obligations and ended the dollars backing by gold. In
more simplistic terms, America defaulted and the value of the dollar
came under substantial pressure.

With equities real values being desecrated, GDP plummeting, unemployment
and the general cost of living increasing as wages declined, a term was
forged to describe America -- stagflation.

Stagflation is a condition of slow economic growth and relatively high
unemployment -- a time of stagnation -- accompanied by a rise in prices,
or inflation.

With the dollar weakening against other currencies now free-floating,
something had to be done to bring back demand for the ever increasing
supply of dollars.

Enter 1973 with then Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. The bargain was
intriguing: America had the worlds strongest military and Saudi Arabia
exported the world's most oil.

[Mr. [Kissinger]{.mark} charismatically and strategically
[persuaded]{.mark} the [Saudi Arabia]{.mark}n King [to]{.mark}
exclusively [sell oil]{.mark} globally [in **dollars
only.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The demand for US dollars was now deemed irresistible, a complete turn
of sentiment from only a couple years earlier.]{.underline}

The US could now run its massive trade deficits (since 1975 America has
never ran a trade surplus) without worry of their dollars demand
declining.

[A short series of events went as followed: [countries needed
oil]{.mark} for their economies. [Nations would export goods to the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [for the dollars.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[In turn they would exchange]{.mark} the [dollars with Saudi]{.mark}
Arabia [and receive oil.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Adding insult to injury towards the rest of the world, the OPEC
(oil-petroleum exporting) countries took their dollar profits and
reinvested them into America's bond market for yield.

The decreased borrowing costs along with increased funds ready to buy
American debt i.e. bonds, while simultaneously running trade deficits to
finance the governments without financial repercussions, the US was
having their cake and eating it in the most simplest of words.

II\. The End

[[Investors should have no problem connecting]{.mark} recent [history of
**American military action**]{.mark} [in the middle east to the **1973
petrodollar deal with Saudi Arabia.**]{.mark}]{.underline} First "we"
invaded Iraq under the false guise of weapons of mass destruction. Heck,
where does one think they received those weapons of mass destruction in
the first place?

Second was Egypt, which America had supported for over 30 years and
financed former dictator Hosni Mubarak with over \$60 billion dollars,
which in 2011 the US helped provide assistance in overthrowing the same
Mr. Mubarak that we had supported years prior.

Third was Libya where we helped topple former ally Muammar Gaddafi.
There are many speculations of why America was bombing the same Libyan
military that the US trained and funded. But one can conclude it was in
Americas and Israel and Saudi Arabia's national interest.

Now and currently it is Syria that The Land of the Free is dealing with.
The Saudi Arabian King was very vocal about the bombings that were
called off in 2013 against the Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad.

For Saudi Arabia, Syria had become a focal frontline with regards to
gain regional influence with Iran, Mr. Assads ally. Now the US, under
the agreement made in 1973, is doing what it can to bring down Assad or
risk losing the dollars prestige of the petrodollar.

The US and Saudi Arabia are even supplying arms, funding, and training
to the Syrian rebels that are turning right around and using them
against the Western influences with terrorist groups such as al Qaeda,
Hezbollah, and the new and dangerous ISIS.

The US and Iran have had warming ties with one another. Saudi Arabia and
Iran are enemies. [This is not something that the Saudis agreed upon
with the Petrodollar deal and is causing strain between the two long
time allies.]{.underline}

As of recently, the OPEC nations -- led by Saudi Arabia -- have been
artificially pushing the price of oil down. Investors should see that
the Syrian regimes backers i.e. Russia and Iran are suffering with the
lower oil prices.

But conversely the biggest damage is being directed towards the US.

Five out of the ten fastest growing economies in the USA are oil
producing states. In fact it would be safe to claim that the entire
growth since the 2008 recession has been from the energy sector.

American fracking and shale oil wells are marginal and high cost
producers unlike the conventional oil producers in Saudi Arabia.

Investors need to critically think and ask themselves questions.

Is Saudi Arabia purposely hindering the US energy boom in fears that if
America becomes oil independent they can disband protecting Saudi
interest?

Or are America and Saudi Arabia working together to temporarily kill
their profits all in the ambition to hurt Russia and Iran?

Maybe Saudi Arabia is pushing oil prices down to help China purchase
more oil?

China does supply Saudi Arabia with most of their military arms and with
the conflict increasing in the middle east and Syrian rebels (which are
Saudi backed) needing weaponry, could this be an agreement for cheap oil
prices and arms?

Investors speculating on the cause of why oil is collapsing theorize
that this is Saudi Arabia's way of exerting its dominance and for the
rest of the world to not forget whom produces the low cost oil.

It would make sense that Saudi Arabia is defending its market share,
hurting its competitors such as Iran and Russia, and also keeping
America at its mercy.

The reason being arbitrary, there is one long term trend taking place:
the petrodollar has become unstable just as the countries in the middle
east have become. A single currency and country controlling the global
oil costs will not last another 40 years.

LEG NUMBER 2: COUNTRIES BYPASSING THE DOLLAR

Russia and China signed a massive energy deal over the summer. A \$400
billion contract for Russia to supply China with gas.

If that was not monumental enough, the two nations signed another
agreement in November.

What is important to note between the lines is that the countries will
bypass the US dollar and pay each other in their domestic currencies.
With Russia's rich abundance of resources and the Chinese low cost labor
and manufacturing business, this will be a critical relationship in the
future.

The emerging market BRICS -- made up of Brazil, Russia, India, China,
and South Africa -- have started bypassing the dollar all together. The
nations have established a competitor to the Western backed IMF, The New
Development Bank.

The Eastern hemisphere and leadership is growing with an anti-dollar
alliance.

Investors will understand that this was an inevitable sequence bound to
happen sooner than later. With the sanctions America has imposed on
countries such as Iran and Russia, the rest of the developing world does
not want their growth hindered by American imperialism.

Infact, there are 23 (60% of worlds GDP) countries that are setting up
swap lines which bypass the dollar and SWIFT payment system, the
dollar-based worldwide transaction network. The countries that are
setting up swap lines are also US allies such as Germany, France, and
the UK.

Here are a list of swap line examples that bypass the dollar and will
lead to a reserve currency collapse...

March 22, 2012 -- Australia and China agreed to a 30bln AUD / 200bln
Yuan swap line agreement.

March 26, 2013 -- Brazil and China set up a currency swap line for 60bln
BRL / 190 bln Yuan.

June 22, 2013 -- Britain officially set up a currency swap line with
China for 2 bln GBP/ 200bln Yuan.

October 9, 2013 -- The European Union created a swap line with China for
45bln EUR/ 350 bln Yuan.

November 8, 2104 -- Canada and China have agreed upon a

30bln CAD/ 200 bln Yuan currency swap.

It should be obvious that the Chinese are having other central banks
hold the Yuan in their reserves.

Since 2008, a weak US economy has contributed to the decline of global
dollar reserves and created opportunities for the rest for the world.
This has resulted in a decline of American influence globally and
increased the momentum for a de-dollarized world.

The dollar's dominance was carried over four decades due to the ability
to purchase Saudi oil with the paper money.

[As investors saw in part one, [the Saudi Kingdom is preparing for a new
global system]{.mark} and unrest in the middle east. And [the world now
seeing]{.mark} the [powerful China and Russian gas relations,]{.mark}
[countries can]{.mark} now [begin to sell their commodities to
other]{.mark} countries [in their own domestic currencies
without]{.mark} the degradation from [American pressure]{.mark} in
foreign policy.]{.underline}

#### Saudi Arabia will ditch the dollar if the US hurts their relations

**[[Saudi Arabia is threatening to sell its oil in currencies other than
the dollar]{.mark} if Washington passes a bill exposing OPEC members to
U.S. antitrust lawsuits,]{.underline}** three sources familiar with
Saudi energy policy said.

They said [the option had been discussed]{.underline} internally
[by]{.underline} senior Saudi energy [officials in recent
months]{.underline}. Two of the sources said the plan had been discussed
with OPEC members and one source briefed on Saudi oil policy said
[Riyadh had also communicated the threat to senior U.S. energy
officials]{.underline}.

The chances of the U.S. bill known as NOPEC coming into force are slim
and Saudi Arabia would be unlikely to follow through, but the fact
Riyadh is considering such a drastic step is a sign of the kingdom's
annoyance about potential U.S. legal challenges to OPEC.

[[In the]{.mark} unlikely [event]{.mark} [Riyadh]{.mark} were to [ditch
the dollar]{.mark}, [it would]{.mark} undermine the its status as the
world's main reserve currency, [reduce Washington's clout in global
trade and weaken its ability to enforce sanctions on nation
states.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"[The [Saudis know they have the dollar as the nuclear
option]{.mark}]{.underline}," one of the sources familiar with the
matter said.

"The Saudis say: let the Americans pass NOPEC and [it would be the U.S.
economy that would fall apart]{.underline}," another source said.

Saudi Arabia's energy ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

A U.S. state department official said: "as a general matter, we don't
comment on pending legislation."

The U.S. Energy Department did not respond to a request for comment.
Energy Secretary Rick Perry has said that NOPEC could lead to unintended
consequences.

Saudi Arabia is considering additional measures against Canada amid
reports it plans to unload its holdings of Canadian stocks and bonds as
a dispute over women's rights activists intensifies.

Foreign Minister Adel Al-Jubeir, speaking at a news conference in
Riyadh, said there was no need for mediation in the dispute. "Canada
knows what it needs to do," he said.

[[The Canadian currency dropped]{.mark} as much as [0.5]{.mark} per cent
[to 76.21 US cents]{.mark} [after]{.mark} the Financial Times reported
that the [Saudi Arabia]{.mark} central bank and state pension funds have
instructed their overseas asset managers to [dispose of Canadian
assets]{.mark} starting Tuesday.]{.underline} The loonie rebounded
shortly afterward to trade 0.1 per cent weaker at 10:03 a.m. in Toronto.

A source at a Saudi bank told Reuters the bank was contacted by the
central bank on Wednesday afternoon asking for information about all
their Canadian exposure -- investments in Canada and foreign exchange
positions.

The bank had received no instructions to sell assets as they do not have
any exposure there, the source said.

[Saudi Arabia suspended diplomatic ties and halted new trade dealings
late Sunday following comments by Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia
Freeland]{.underline} criticizing the kingdom for arrests of women's
rights activists. The kingdom has since escalated its moves against
Canada, suspending flights to Toronto and ordering the return of
thousands of students who are studying at Canadian schools.

Saudi Arabia's deepening row with Canada threatens to scare off regime's
already nervous foreign investors

cost']{.mark}, FT reports]{.underline}

[[The cost]{.mark} of landing on Saudi Arabia's bad side [will be
big]{.mark}]{.underline}

Russia voiced support for Saudi Arabia in its worsening row with Canada
on Wednesday, telling Ottawa it was unacceptable to lecture the kingdom
on human rights.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that human
rights should be promoted with respect for specific national customs and
traditions.

"We have always said that the politicisation of human rights matters is
unacceptable," Zakharova said.

"What one probably needs in this situation is constructive advice and
assistance rather than criticism from a 'moral superior'," she said.

Since rising to power in 2015, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has
courted Western allies to support his reform plans, offering billions of
dollars of arms sales and promising to fight radicalism in the kingdom.

But the row threatens to slow Riyadh's foreign investment drive, a
campaign already unsettled by a series of assertive foreign policy
initiatives by the top oil exporter.

Inflows slowed in recent years mainly due to low oil prices, but
regional turmoil doesn't help, critics of the government say.

"Saudi Arabia simply cannot afford to alienate any other sections of the
global community in the midst of its unpopular military engagement in
Yemen, its indirect confrontation with Iran," commentator Jamal
Khashoggi wrote in the Washington Post.

Saudi's asset sales may not have a big impact on the Canadian currency,
although [seasonally thin trading in August could exacerbate that
effect. Saudi holdings of Canadian dollar reserves are between \$10
billion and \$25 billion, with the upper end of that estimate
representing 10 per cent of daily Canadian dollar volumes, according to
estimates from the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.]{.underline}

[["That's enough to leave a mark on the loonie]{.mark} in August when
volumes are typically lighter,]{.underline}" said Bipan Rai, North
American head of foreign exchange strategy at CIBC. Still, Rai said the
impact on the currency should be "ephemeral" as bilateral trade between
Saudi Arabia and Canada is small.

So far this year, Canada has exported \$1.4 billion in merchandise goods
to Saudi Arabia and imported \$2 billion, according to Statistics Canada
data.

# AFF \-- Warming Turn

## I/T Collapse

### 2AC

#### Collapse good- only way to be able to reduce emissions

**Vernon morning star 19 '** ( May. 25, 2019 "standard of living is not
sustainable"
https://www.vernonmorningstar.com/opinion/standard-of-living-is-not-sustainable/)

The other statement that stood out for me was, "We must be able to
afford the solutions [if [our economies are not to collapse under the
weight]{.mark} [of]{.mark} irrational
[policies]{.mark}]{.underline}...." Quite a lot is packed into this
statement.

First off, as much as we like to think of ourselves as rational, Western
economic policies are highly irrational. Our "good life" is based on
several actions. Western societies exploit through military and
financial domination as much of the world's resources as they can.

[Our [economy is based]{.mark}]{.underline} almost entirely
[[on]{.mark}]{.underline} debt, [reliant [mainly]{.mark}]{.underline} on
the U.S. global reserve currency, [the [petrodollar]{.mark}, which the
U.S. can "sell" as much of as they can as it is currently required by
other countries]{.underline} to purchase most items (caution: Russia and
China are slowly leading others away from the petrodollar and thus U.S.
economic control). [Our [economy is a consumer-based one]{.mark}, much
of which is never recycled or reused and much of that consumption is
debt based.]{.underline}

In 2008, there was a signal about what needs to be done to help the
environment from its plague of chemical contaminants. [As the [economy
declined, so did the carbon emissions.]{.mark} Unfortunately, the best
way to help the [environment is to collapse our current economy globally
to a non-consumer oriented on]{.mark}]{.underline}[e]{.mark}, to one
that provides more support to health, education, workers rights and
safety, human rights in general, support for independent farmers, and
works towards eliminating all harmful chemicals from the environment.

[In short, our standard of [living is not sustainable, is not
rational]{.mark}, will [eventually collapse, hopefully]{.mark}
[not]{.mark} [cataclysmically]{.mark}. I highly doubt that a
[significant number of people are willing to decrease their lifestyle in
a significant way]{.mark} in order to change our current
economic/environmental trajectory.]{.underline}

#### Reducing emissions is key to solve global warming

**MacMillan 16** (Amanda MacMillan - a health and science writer who has
contributed to Outside, Shape, Self, Prevention, WebMD, and other
publications, "Global Warming 101" -- NRDC,
https://www.nrdc.org/stories/global-warming-101)

**Here\'s a simple definition of global warming. (And yes, it\'s really
happening.) [Over the past 50 years, [the average global
temperature]{.mark} has [increased at the fastest rate in]{.mark}
recorded [history]{.mark}.]{.underline} And experts see the trend is
accelerating: All but one of the 16 hottest years in NASA's 134-year
record have occurred since 2000. Climate change deniers have argued that
there has been a "pause" or a "slowdown" in rising global temperatures,
but several recent studies, including a 2015 paper published in the
journal Science, have disproved this claim. And [[scientists say that
unless we curb]{.mark} global-warming [emissions, average]{.mark} U.S.
[temperatures could increase by]{.mark} up to [10 degrees Fahrenheit
over the next century.]{.mark}]{.underline} In the United States[, [the
burning of fossil fuels]{.underline}]{.mark} [to make electricity [is
the largest source of heat-trapping pollution, producing]{.mark} about
two billion [tons of CO2 every year]{.mark}]{.underline}. Coal-burning
power plants are by far the biggest polluters. The country's
second-largest source of carbon pollution is the transportation sector,
which generates about 1.7 billion tons of CO2 emissions a year.**

#### Global warming results in ocean acidification and collapse of the marine food web- means extinction.

**Romm '9** (Joe, a Fellow at American Progress and is the editor of
Climate Progress, which **[New York Times]{.underline}** columnist Tom
Friedman called \"the indispensable blog\" and Time magazine named one

[[Global warming is "capable of wrecking the marine ecosystem]{.mark}
and depriving future generations of the harvest of the
seas"]{.underline} (see Ocean dead zones to expand, "remain for
thousands of years"). A post on ocean acidification from the new
Conservation Law Foundation blog has brought to my attention that the
first documentary on the subject, *A Sea Change:* Imagine a World
without Fish, is coming out. [[Ocean acidification]{.mark} must be a
core climate message, since it **[is]{.mark}** hard to deny and
**[impervious]{.mark}** **[to]{.mark}** the delusion that
**[geoengineering]{.mark}** is the silver bullet]{.underline}. Indeed, a
major 2009 study GRL study, "[Sensitivity of ocean acidification to
geoengineered climate stabilization"]{.underline} (subs. req'd),
concluded: The results of this paper support the view that [climate
engineering will not resolve the problem of ocean acidification, and
that [therefore deep and rapid cuts in CO~2~ emissions are likely to be
the most effective strategy]{.mark} to avoid environmental damage from
future ocean acidification]{.underline}. If you want to understand ocean
acidification better, see this BBC story, which explains: **[Man-made
[pollution is raising ocean acidity at least 10 times faster than
previously thought]{.mark}]{.underline}**, a study says. Or see this
*Science* magazine study, "Evidence for Upwelling of Corrosive
"Acidified" Water onto the Continental Shelf" (subs. req'), which found
Our results show for the first time that [a large section of the North
American continental shelf is impacted by ocean
acidification]{.underline}. Other continental shelf regions may also be
impacted where anthropogenic CO2-enriched water is being upwelled onto
the shelf. Or listen to the Australia's ARC Centre of Excellence for
Coral Reef Studies, which warns: [The world's oceans are becoming more
acid, with potentially devastating consequences for corals and the
marine organisms that build reefs and provide much of the Earth's
breathable oxygen.]{.underline} [The acidity is caused by the gradual
buildup of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, dissolving into the
oceans]{.underline}. Scientists fear it could be lethal for animals with
chalky skeletons which make up more than a third of the planet's marine
life"¦. [[Corals and plankton with chalky skeletons are]{.mark} at [the
base of the marine food web]{.mark}. They rely on sea water saturated
with calcium carbonate to form their skeletons]{.underline}. However,
[as acidity intensifies, the saturation declines, making it harder for
the animals to form their skeletal structures]{.underline} (calcify).
"Analysis of coral cores shows a steady drop in calcification over the
last 20 years," says Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg of CoECRS and the
University of Queensland. "There's not much debate about how it happens:
put more CO2 into the air above and it dissolves into the oceans. "When
CO2 levels in the atmosphere reach about 500 parts per million, you put
calcification out of business in the oceans." (Atmospheric CO2 levels
are presently 385 ppm, up from 305 in 1960.) I'd like to see an analysis
of what happens when you get to 850 to 1000+ ppm because that is where
we're headed (see U.S. media largely ignores latest warning from climate
scientists: "Recent observations confirm "¦ the worst-case IPCC scenario
trajectories (or even worse) are being realised" "" 1000 ppm). The CLF
post notes: Dr. Jane Lubchenco, Administrator of the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) warns that an acidic ocean is the
"equally evil twin" of climate change. Scott Doney, a senior scientist
at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution noted in a public
presentation that "New England is the most vulnerable region in the
country to ocean acidification." In June, [dozens of Academies of
Science, including ours and China's, issued a joint statement on ocean
acidification]{.underline}, warned "[Marine food supplies are likely to
be reduced with significant implications for food production and
security in regions dependent on fish protein, and human health and
wellbeing"]{.underline} and "[Ocean acidification is irreversible on
timescales of **at least** tens of thousands of years]{.underline}."
They conclude: Ocean acidification is a direct consequence of increasing
atmospheric CO2 concentrations. To avoid substantial damage to ocean
ecosystems, deep and rapid reductions of global CO2 emissions by at
least 50% by 2050, and much more thereafter are needed. We, the
academies of science working through the InterAcademy Panel on
International Issues (IAP), call on world leaders to: "¢ [Acknowledge
that ocean acidification is a direct and real consequence of increasing
atmospheric [CO2]{.mark} concentrations, is already having an effect at
current concentrations, and [is likely to cause]{.mark} **[grave harm
to]{.mark} important [marine ecosystems]{.mark} as CO2 [concentrations
reach 450 ppm and above]{.mark}**]{.underline}**;** "¢ Recognise that
reducing the build up of CO2 in the atmosphere is the only practicable
solution to mitigating ocean acidification; "¢ Within the context of the
UNFCCC negotiations in the run up to Copenhagen 2009, recognise the
direct threats posed by increasing atmospheric CO2 emissions to the
oceans and therefore society, and take action to mitigate this threat;
"¢ Implement action to reduce global CO2 emissions by at least 50% of
1990 levels by 2050 and continue to reduce them thereafter. [[If we want
to save life in the oceans "" **and**]{.mark} **save
[ourselves]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [since we depend on that life "" [the
time to start slashing carbon dioxide emissions is
now]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### EX - Emissions Cause Warming

#### Emissions cause global warming

**C2ES N/D** (C2ES - the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions -- an
independent, nonpartisan, nonprofit organization working to forge
practical solutions to climate change, "Climate Basics",
https://www.c2es.org/content/climate-basics-for-kids/)

Scientific evidence paints a clear picture: Climate change is happening,
it is caused in large part by human activity, and it will have many
serious and potentially damaging effects in the decades ahead.
[Greenhouse gas [emissions]{.mark} from cars, power plants and other
man-made sources---rather than natural variations in climate---[are the
primary cause]{.mark}. These [emissions include carbon dioxide]{.mark}
--- the main greenhouse gas --- [which has reached a concentration level
in our atmosphere that the Earth hasn't seen for]{.mark} more than
[400,000 years.]{.mark}]{.underline} These greenhouse gases act like a
blanket, trapping the sun's warmth near the earth's surface, and
affecting the planet's climate system. Today in the United States,
electricity and transportation (cars, trucks and planes) are responsible
for almost 60 percent of carbon dioxide emissions. The rest comes from
agriculture, industry, such as factories that make products we use, and
from energy we use in our homes and businesses. [The first is to reduce
the [greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate

homes, offices, and cars, and being more efficient and less wasteful, we
can produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions.

#### US dollar hegemony hurts U.S. economy \-- laundry list

**Palley 6/20** (Thomas I. Palley - an American economist who has served
as the chief economist for the US--China Economic and Security Review
Commission. He is currently Schwartz Economic Growth Fellow at the New
America Foundation, "Why Dollar Hegemony Is Unhealthy" -- Yale
University,
https://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/why-dollar-hegemony-unhealthy)

The US dollar is the world's premiere currency, with approximately two
thirds of world official foreign-exchange holdings being dollars.
Moreover, many countries appear willing to run sustained trade surpluses
with the US, supplying everything from t-shirts to Porsches in return
for additional dollar holdings. This willingness to exchange valuable
resources for paper IOUs represents a form of dollar tribute. Many
foreign policymakers complain about [the special **[advantage
]{.mark}**]{.underline}[f**[or the US,]{.underline}**
[allow]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[the nation to run enormous trade
deficits without]{.mark} apparent [market sanction]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Whereas [balance-of-payments [considerations constrain other countries
to run tight economic policies]{.mark}, [no]{.mark} equivalent
[constraint]{.mark} appears to [hold]{.mark} for [the
US]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This advantage is rooted in the dollar's
special role as the world's reserve currency.]{.underline} For the US,
one major benefit of the dollar's reserve-currency role is that [[it
increases]{.mark} the [demand for US financial
assets]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [This drives up prices of stocks and bonds
and lowers interest rates,]{.underline}]{.mark} thereby [increasing
household wealth and lowering the cost of borrowing money]{.underline}.
Additionally, [[the US]{.mark} government [gets]{.mark}]{.underline}
seignories, or an [[interest-free loan]{.underline}]{.mark}, from the
hundreds of millions in dollar bills held offshore. Printing a \$100
bill is almost costless to the US government, but foreigners must give
more than \$100 of resources to get the bill. That's a tidy profit for
US taxpayers. Increased foreign demand for US assets also appreciates
the dollar, which is a mixed blessing. On one hand, consumers benefit
from lower import prices. On the other[[, it makes US manufacturing less
competitive internationally because an overvalued dollar makes US
exports more expensive and imports cheaper.]{.mark} [Reserve-currency
status]{.mark} therefore [promotes trade deficits and
de-industrialization]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The logic of this third theory is easily illustrated. Over the last
decade, while Europe and Japan stagnate, the US has grown on the back of
robust consumer spending. This spending has sucked in imports, helping
growth in Europe, East Asia and Latin America, and making the US the
major engine of global growth. East Asian countries, especially China,
have been particularly willing to run trade surpluses with the US
because this has fuelled export-led growth. These countries rely on
exports to keep their factories operating. Export success then attracts
foreign direct investment that advances development. Undervalued
exchange rates are vital for this strategy as it keeps exports
competitive. Countries have therefore channeled their trade surpluses
into dollars, keeping the dollar overvalued and enabling them to sell in
the US market. This explains both the continuing strong demand for
dollars despite the US trade deficit and the dollar's dominance in
official foreign-exchange holdings. Ironically, America's dispensation
from trade-deficit discipline stems from other countries' failure to
develop an equivalent of the American consumer. [Countries]{.underline}
want to industrialize with full employment, but they lack adequate
internal demand. Consequently, they must [rely on the US
market]{.underline}. It is also why Germany supplies BMWs and
Mercedes-Benzes in return for paper dollar IOUs. Conventional theory
says [[the dollar]{.mark} will]{.underline} only [[lose its dominance
when countries become saturated with dollar
holdings]{.underline}]{.mark}. At that stage they will cease buying and
may even sell dollars, causing the currency to fall. The problem with
this story is that countries have no incentive to sell dollars, as this
would kill the golden goose of export-led growth.

[Rich nations]{.underline} need to recognize that their efforts to
[squeeze every last drop of advantage from]{.underline} already [[unfair
finance and trade]{.mark} will only [plunge the world into deeper
depression]{.mark}]{.underline}. History has shown that while the poor
suffer more in economic collapse, the rich, even as they are financially
cushioned by their wealth and advantage, are hurt by the sociopolitical
repercussions of such a collapse, in the form of war, revolution or
both. [[Dollar hegemony prevents]{.mark} all [non-dollar economies from
financing domestic development with sovereign
credit]{.mark}]{.underline}, denominated in their own currencies[[;
it]{.mark} [forces them to rely on foreign capital denominated in
dollars]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, the [[exporting economies
are]{.mark} in essence shipping the [real wealth created]{.mark} there
[by low wages and environmental abuse to importing
nations]{.mark}.]{.underline} The dollar-denominated trade surplus
earned by exporting nations cannot be spent in their domestic economies
without first converting those dollars into local currencies. But [[the
conversion]{.mark} will [create inflation]{.mark} since the wealth
behind the new local currency has already been shipped [to the importing
nations]{.mark}.]{.underline} Thus, exporting nations, while starved for
capital, have to invest the dollars they earn from low wages and
environmental abuse back into the dollar economy, enabling the importing
economies to have more dollars with which to import more. Capital from
the dollar economy is in reality debt from the exporting economies,
which will return to the lending economies as foreign capital to invest
in the export sector. [[Dollar hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark} in essence
freely transfers the wealth from poor economies to rich economies. This
free transfer of wealth [[hurts workers]{.mark} in both the poor and
rich economies [by keeping wages low]{.mark} through cross-border wage
arbitrage. [Low wages]{.mark} then [create overcapacity, unsupported by
demand in every economy.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### US dollar hegemony poison global dependence

The US dollar holds value for more countries than any other world
currency and comprises about two thirds of world's official
foreign-exchange holdings. This dependence allows [the US]{.underline}
to [run large trade deficits in purchasing a cornucopia of
goods]{.underline} -- from Porsches to t-shirts -- by distributing paper
IOUs in place of actual dollars. Because of a global faith in the

[other [nations' neglect of investment in their own]{.mark} domestic
[markets and over-reliance on the American consumer is fraught with
danger]{.mark}.]{.underline} Even when appreciation of the US dollar
drove up stocks and bonds and lowered interest rates, [[the]{.mark}
co-dependent [relationship was unhealthy for the US and its commercial
partners. The recent downturn in the world]{.mark} market, following
fear of inflation in the US and rising interest rates, [shows the
inherent danger]{.mark}. [For the sake of world financial stability,
Palley urges]{.mark} [Europe and Japan]{.mark} to [encourage domestic
consumption and reduce their dependence on American
consumers.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Dollar hegemony is harmful, it creates trade deficits and de-industrialization

**Palley 06** (Thomas Palley, Palley runs the Economics for Democratic
and Open Societies Project, and is the former chief economist of the
US-China Economic & Security Review Commission. He is the author of
"Plenty of Nothing: The Downsizing of the American Dream and the Case
for Structural Keynesianism" (Princeton University Press, 1998), \"Why
Dollar Hegemony is Unhealthy\", 6/20/06,
https://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/why-dollar-hegemony-unhealthy)

WASHINGTON: With US Federal Reserve chairman warning about inflation,
the US dollar is in the news these days, and there's a sense that [[the
world]{.mark} economy [has become]{.mark} excessively reliant on the
dollar. This reliance smacks of [dysfunctional]{.mark} co-dependence
whereby [the US and the rest of the world both rely on the dollar's
strength, but neither is well served by it.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The US dollar is the world's premiere currency, with approximately two
thirds of world official foreign-exchange holdings being dollars.
Moreover, many countries appear willing to run sustained trade surpluses
with the US, supplying everything from t-shirts to Porsches in return
for additional dollar holdings. This willingness to exchange valuable
resources for paper IOUs represents a form of dollar tribute.

[Many foreign policymakers complain about the special advantage for the
US, allowing the nation to run enormous trade deficits without apparent
market sanction.]{.underline} Whereas balance-of-payments considerations
constrain other countries to run tight economic policies, no equivalent
constraint appears to hold for the US. This advantage is rooted in the
dollar's special role as the world's reserve currency.

For the US, one major benefit of the dollar's reserve-currency role is
that it increases the demand for US financial assets. This drives up
prices of stocks and bonds and lowers interest rates, thereby increasing
household wealth and lowering the cost of borrowing money. Additionally,
the US government gets seignorage, or an interest-free loan, from the
hundreds of millions in dollar bills held offshore. Printing a \$100
bill is almost costless to the US government, but foreigners must give
more than \$100 of resources to get the bill. That's a tidy profit for
US taxpayers.

[[Increased foreign demand]{.mark} for US assets]{.underline} also
appreciates the dollar, which is a mixed blessing. On one hand,
consumers benefit from lower import prices. On the other, it [[makes US
manufacturing less competitive internationally]{.mark} because an
overvalued dollar makes US exports more expensive [and]{.mark} imports
cheaper. Reserve-currency status therefore [promotes trade deficits and
de-industrialization.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The conventional explanation of the dollar's reserve-currency status is
a "medium of exchange" story. The US has historically been the largest
and richest currency area, with the largest share of world output and
trade. This has provided incentives for other countries to hold and use
dollars. Additionally, the fact that many governments over-issue their
own money and create high inflation encourages foreign citizens to
protect themselves by holding dollars instead of domestic currency.

A second theory of reserve currencies, associated with the political
left, is based on US military power and the Pax Americana. The argument
is that US military power provides the security that protects the global
market system, and New York is the new Rome. Countries, such as Saudi
Arabia, hold reserves in dollars because New York is a political safe
haven and because that helps cover the costs of enforcing the Pax
Americana.

These two theories are mutually reinforcing. Thus, to the extent that
the dollar is widely used and is also a safe haven, investors tend to
rush into dollars in times of uncertainty. Consequently, central banks
in other countries need to accumulate large dollar-reserve holdings to
protect against financial disruptions that result from sudden exits by
investors, as happened in East Asia in 1997.

There is a third unrecognized theory that can be labeled the "buyer of
last resort" theory of reserve currencies. Put bluntly, [[the tribute
other countries pay]{.mark} the US through their trade surpluses [is the
result of their failure]{.mark} to generate adequate consumption
spending [in their own markets]{.mark}]{.underline}, be it due to poor
income distribution or bad domestic economic policies. [[This forces
other countries to rely on the American consumer]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The logic of this third theory is easily illustrated. Over the last
decade, while Europe and Japan stagnate, the US has grown on the back of
robust consumer spending. This spending has sucked in imports, helping
growth in Europe, East Asia and Latin America, and making the US the
major engine of global growth.

East Asian countries, especially China, have been particularly willing
to run trade surpluses with the US because this has fuelled export-led
growth. These countries rely on exports to keep their factories
operating. Export success then attracts foreign direct investment that
advances development. Undervalued exchange rates are vital for this
strategy as it keeps exports competitive. [Countries have therefore
channeled their trade surpluses into dollars, keeping the dollar
overvalued and enabling them to sell in the US market. This explains
both the continuing strong demand for dollars despite the US trade
deficit and the dollar's dominance in official foreign-exchange
holdings.]{.underline}

### L/T - U.S. Firms

#### US dollar hegemony have negative impacts on US firms

**Bernanke 16** (Ben S. Bernanke - a Distinguished Fellow in residence
with the Economic Studies Program at the Brookings Institution, as well
as a Senior Advisor to PIMCO and Citadel, "The dollar's international
role: An "exorbitant privilege"?",
https://www.brookings.edu/blog/ben-bernanke/2016/01/07/the-dollars-international-role-an-exorbitant-privilege-2/)

What else? A great deal of U.S. currency is held abroad, which amounts
to an interest-free loan to the United States. However, the interest
savings are probably on the order of \$20 billion a year, a small
fraction of a percent of U.S. GDP, and that "[seigniorage]{.underline},"
as it is called, [would probably still exist even if the dollar lost
ground to other currencies]{.underline} in more-formal less informal
international transactions. U.S. firms may face slightly less
exchange-rate risk in international transactions, but that benefit
should not be overstated since the dollar floats against the currencies
of most of our largest trading partners. The safe haven aspect of [[the
dollar is]{.mark} actually a [negative for U.S. firms]{.mark}, since [it
implies that they become less competitive]{.mark}]{.underline} (the
dollar is stronger) [at precisely the times that global economic
conditions are most difficult. [Overall,]{.mark} the fact that English
is the common language of international business and politics [is of
considerably more benefit to the United States than is the global role
of the dollar.]{.mark}]{.underline} The exorbitant privilege is not so
exorbitant any more.

#### US dollar hegemony hurts US companies

Economy", https://fortune.com/2016/07/20/value-us-dollar-economy/)

[[The world's largest companies took a major step back]{.mark} over the
past year.]{.underline} Cumulative sales of the Global 500---Fortune's
annual list of the biggest companies on the planet ranked by revenue, in
dollars, for the previous fiscal year---[[declined for the first time
since 2010]{.underline}]{.mark}. And not by a token amount either.
[[Total revenue shrank]{.mark} from \$31.2 trillion in fiscal 2014 to
\$27.6 trillion in 2015, or a fall of [11.5%]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[Profits dropped by 11.2%,]{.underline}]{.mark} [to \$1.48
trillion.]{.underline} There are plenty of reasons for the reversal. A
slowdown in China's once-booming economy has affected companies
worldwide. Growth in the U.S. and Europe remains modest at best. And
sustained low oil prices have erased billions in sales for giant
petroleum producers like Exxon Mobil (XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A),
and Sinopec. But [[one macroeconomic trend looms largest of all: the
explosive comeback of the U.S. dollar]{.mark} and the wide-ranging
impact of its renewed strength on global trade.]{.underline}

#### US dollar hegemony weakens companies

**Tully 16** (Shawn Tully - specializes in banking, federal budget and
spending issues, and health care. Tully holds a B.A. in English from
Princeton University, an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago, and a
master's in Applied Economics from the Universite Catholique de Louvain
in Belgium, "How a Spike in the Value of the Dollar Is Hurting the U.S.
Economy", https://fortune.com/2016/07/20/value-us-dollar-economy/)

Why does a [[strong dollar mean lower sales]{.underline}]{.mark} for the
Global 500? The reason is twofold. [First, exports for U.S.
corporations---the largest group on the list, with [a total of 134
companies---weakened because the surging dollar meant that their prices
were higher in foreign markets.]{.mark} Second, sales outside the
U.S.---whether by U.S. or non-U.S. multi-nationals---[in foreign
currencies such as euros, yen, and yuan translated into far fewer
dollars than they did last year.]{.mark}]{.underline} For instance, 1
billion euros in sales added up to \$1.3 billion in 2014 and just \$1.1
billion in 2015. Part of this is technical, of course, driven by the
fact that the Global 500 is calculated in dollars. To determine
rankings, we use an average of exchange rates over the previous year to
convert, say, Toshiba's sales from yen into dollars. Incredibly, no
fewer than 19 of the 21 currencies represented on the list retreated
against the dollar in 2015. The euro fell 16.4% vs. the dollar, the yen
slid 8.4%, and the yuan dipped 2%. Emerging-market currencies took the
biggest hits---notably the Brazilian real (--29.4%) and the Russian
ruble (--36.9%). The best measure of how U.S. multi-nationals fared
against foreign competitors is to strip out the conversion effect and
compare revenue growth in home currencies. Overall, Asian companies
performed the best last year, lifting their average sales in yen,
rupees, and the like by 11%, vs. a 5.8% gain after conversion to
dollars. China was an exception, however: Though the yuan fell slightly
against the dollar, it appreciated strongly vs. most of the world's
currencies, pummeling exports of Chinese companies. European companies
on average had flat sales in their local currencies. But many that did
large volume in the U.S. performed brilliantly, as they got a boost from
being able to produce their goods in euros or pounds and sell them in
dollars.

synonymous with falling equity prices, while [a weaker dollar can cause
stock prices to rise]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, the relationship
between currency valuations and the stock market is complex. A weak
dollar is not necessarily good news for investors. The relationship
between the value of the US dollar and the stock market is far from
direct. That being said, a cheaper dollar can strengthen exports which,
in turn, can boost domestic profits and share value. This is just one
example of the impact of value adjustments to the US dollar. Before
1973, the Bretton Woods international monetary system determined the
value of the U.S. dollar. In 1973, the federal government decided to
float the dollar; the currency\'s value is now based on supply and
demand. Commodities including gold and oil are priced in dollars.
Foreign investors buy dollars to make transactions involving dollar
denominated goods easier to facilitate. For the same reason, U.S.
companies and investors buy euros, pesos and other currencies. Many
foreign investors view the dollar as a safe haven investment and buy
U.S. currency when other nations experience economic problems.
Conversely, investors often sell dollars when the U.S. economy goes into
a downturn. If the dollar drops in value, the price of goods denominated
in dollars increases. Consequently, stocks in energy companies may rise
as the dollar weakens. Imports become more expensive after a dollar
devaluation, but foreign companies can acquire American goods at lower
prices. This helps to drive up exports. As exports increase, profits
rise and stocks in U.S. companies rise in value. Investors attempting to
profit from rising stock prices may shift their cash from bonds to
stocks. The increased competition for stocks drives prices up even
further. So-called day traders are sensitive to current economic trends.
These investors help to drive up stock prices when the dollar weakens.
However, other investors take a longer-term view and analyze the
underlying factors that have caused the dollar to fall in value. Issues
such as excessive levels of government debt may raise red flags and
suggest that the U.S. economy is headed into a downturn. Consequently,
investors may shy away from stocks and move their money into safer
investments, such as bonds. This action could cause the stock market
rally to dissipate. On the other hand, if the long-term economic
forecast looks good, investors may snap up stocks with the expectation
that they can make gains as the economy stabilizes. [The U.S. stock
market includes]{.underline} a variety of funds that trade currencies
and assets denominated in dollars. Some [[funds attempt to capitalize on
a strong dollar by investing in oil, gold and U.S.]{.mark}
currency.]{.underline} Other funds take a contrarian view and bet
against the dollar by investing in currencies from other nations. [[When
the dollar drops in value, funds containing foreign currency and assets
rise in value]{.mark}. The gains in these securities are offset by
losses in funds tied to the dollar.]{.underline}

## AT Heg

### Trumpers

#### American hegemony is already dead and will continue -- empirics and Trump

[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has been the world's greatest
power since 1945]{.mark}, when that mantle---half-passed from London to
Washington after the First World War---firmly landed in American hands
after the Second World War.]{.underline} Since 1991, when the Cold War
ended with Soviet collapse, America has been the world's hegemon, to use
the proper term, the force whose power could not be seriously challenged
on the global stage.

For 26 years now---a happy generation---America has been able to do
whatever it wanted, to anyone, at any time of our choosing, anywhere on
earth. Notwithstanding the decline of major sectors of the American
economy, our military has covered the globe with deployments as the
Pentagon has divided our planet into "geographic combatant commands" to
formalize our hegemony. Our allegedly deep defense thinkers have hailed
this as our viceroys enacting Washington's benevolent imperial will
anywhere we desire.

It needs to be said that plenty of the planet has been happy to
acquiesce in American hegemony. While we're hardly the pure-hearted
hegemon we imagine ourselves to be, the United States appears like a
relatively positive force on the global stage, compared to other
options. Even among skeptics regarding America's global dominance, few
pine instead for hegemony under, say, Beijing and its Communist party
bosses.

Nevertheless, [[2017 gave]{.mark} unmistakable [signs]{.mark} that
American [hegemony]{.mark}, which has been waning for a decade, [has now
ended]{.mark}.]{.underline} A new age has dawned, even though it's still
early and the sun is far from full. As commander-in-chief, in his first
year in the Oval Office, [President Donald Trump has ranted and raved on
Twitter almost daily, with no effect save to confuse our allies about
what exactly is going on in Washington.]{.underline} De facto, America
has two foreign and defense policies: what the president says and what
our national security bureaucracy does. [[The gap between presidential
rhetoric]{.mark}, much of it unhinged, [and]{.mark} actual
[policy]{.mark} toward the world [grew throughout
2017.]{.mark}]{.underline}

It's no wonder, then, that North Korea seems anything but cowed, despite
a year of Trumpian rants at Pyongyang. The Kim dynasty keeps rattling
its nuclear saber at will, firing off missiles over the Pacific to
showcase its power, and Washington's demands that they cease have had no
impact. While the Trump administration propagates the fantasy that North
Korea will never become a nuclear power, that troublesome country has
plainly had atomic weapons for years. That this unreality-based policy
might end badly for everyone---even a merely conventional war on the
Korean peninsula will mean millions of refugees and casualties---is
obvious and constitutes one of the major what-ifs for the coming year.

The National Security Strategy recently rolled out by the White House
with fanfare, however, appreciates none of these new geopolitical
realities. It imagines a world where American power, while now
confronted by Russia and a rising China, remains above fundamental
challenge. Predictably, the president's release of "his" NSS had barely
any connection to the actual document. To be fair to Trump, the NSS
always is a political write-up, not really any kind of strategy, and the
relationship between its wish-list and actual Beltway policy is often
tenuous; the current administration has decided to sever any NSS
connection to reality altogether.

It should be noted that President [[Trump **inherited a hegemon in
decline.**]{.mark} His [predecessors did plenty of damage]{.mark} before
the current Oval Office occupant decided to inflict more. Bill
[Clinton's well-intentioned]{.mark} if often mishandled [humanitarian
interventions]{.mark} in the Balkans [gave the illusion]{.mark} that
[America knew how to "nation build"]{.mark} broken societies at modest
cost in lives and treasure.]{.underline}

We did not, as is demonstrated by the multi-decade debacles in the
Greater Middle East initiated by George W. Bush in the aftermath of
9/11. In overreaction to jihadist terrorism, Washington decided to
recreate that troubled region by, in effect, handing a broken Iraq to
the mullahs in Tehran. The magical transformative powers of the U.S.
military on foreign societies turned out to be as much a fantasy as the
Bush experiment with mortgage loans for everyone. In a similar vein, the
less said about our never-ending war in Afghanistan---which amounts to
an effort to coercively make that country what it has never been,
politically and socially---perhaps the better.

[[The loss of]{.mark} American [prestige associated with the Iraqi and
Afghan]{.mark} debacles [is difficult to overstate]{.mark}. Plenty of
the world was content to go along with American hegemony so long as it
was somewhat competent]{.underline}. [No fair-minded
strategist]{.underline}, surveying what the Bush administration did in
the Muslim heartland, [could look at Washington's defense and foreign
policy elites, the architects of grand failures, with any
comfort.]{.underline}

[Not that Barack [Obama]{.mark} made things better.]{.underline}
Although he [[entered the White House]{.mark} with a mandate [to
undo]{.mark} the [damage]{.mark} wrought by his predecessor, [he mostly
failed]{.mark} to do so.]{.underline} It's difficult to not have
sympathy for President Obama, who when he realized the extent of the
Iraq horror he inherited, wanted to abandon the biggest failure in
America's history abroad. [It's less easy to excuse Obama's missteps in
Afghanistan]{.underline}, where a half-hearted "surge" failed to change
any facts on the ground that really mattered.

Still, Obama's biggest failures came elsewhere. [[His willingness to
participate in the overthrow of the Gadhafi regime]{.mark} in Libya on
dubious humanitarian grounds [birthed violence]{.mark} and crisis graver
than existed there in the first place.]{.underline} Worse, taking out
the former rogue Gadhafi after he had abandoned his weapons of mass
destruction and was cooperating with America's war on terrorism, sent an
indelible message that Washington's word is no good---so never, ever
give up your WMDs. Pyongyang, among others, watched and learned.

Then [there's [Obama's mishandling of Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}, with
fateful consequences. His abandonment of his own "red line" in Syria in
2013 was easily read as a grave strategic error, since Obama in effect
outsourced U.S. policy in the Middle East to Moscow---the results of
which are painfully clear today. [Obama's reticence to do much about
Vladimir Putin's aggression in Ukraine a few months later is a matter of
record, while his strange unwillingness to confront the Kremlin over its
rancid spy-propaganda offensive against the West in 2015 undoubtedly
encouraged aggressive Russian interference in America's election the
following year.]{.underline}

Putin and other malefactors got the message that Obama's America would
not stand up to troublemakers who could push back. Diffident messaging
is never good for the hegemon's reputation, especially when it's already
blighted due to incompetence and imperial overstretch. In 2017, in stark
contrast, Donald Trump led the country in the opposite direction, with
unceasing bluster about American strength and willingness to go it
alone, anytime Washington wants to, damn the consequences.

[[Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark} screw the-world style in foreign affairs
was on display this month with the White House's [decision to recognize
Jerusalem as Israel's capital. This [pleased the Israeli]{.mark}
right-wing and major donors to President Trump, [yet in no way
enhanced]{.mark} American [power]{.mark} or prestige: quite the
opposite. Reaction from the Muslim world was predictably furious, while
[the]{.mark} Trump [administration]{.mark} [made everything worse at the
U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations.]{.underline} There, Nikki Haley, our
ambassador, publicly threatened members who didn't vote with Washington
against a UN resolution condemning our embassy move. This was American
diplomacy at its most heavy-handed and tone-deaf, and it failed
dismally. Virtually the whole world voted against Trump, with even most
of NATO siding against Washington. This was a major diplomatic defeat
for the alleged global hegemon.

President Trump is all about "strength" and he loves to tweet about our
military, his own draft-dodging notwithstanding. In a sense, Trump is a
perfect fit for our era, when all America has left is raw military
power. Our economy has been in decline for decades, our divided society
displays unmissable rot, and our politics are a partisan shamble in the
aftermath of 2016. What America has left is its military, which is the
ultimate underpinning of hegemony.

However, [just how much military overmatch the Pentagon has left, after
a near-generation of down-punching in the Middle East against
fourth-rate foes without strategic success, is now America's great
imponderable. [We have spent **trillions** of dollars]{.mark} on Iraq,
Afghanistan, and killing jihadists all over, and the price in military
obsolescence and declining morale is evident to anyone who wants to
see.]{.underline}

Our Air Force, which hasn't faced a serious peer competitor in the skies
since the middle of the Second World War, is shedding pilots at an
alarming rate, while it has far too few F-22 fighters to maintain air
dominance worldwide, which Washington has taken as a given for decades.
However, [our Navy is in even worse shape, with a staggering number of
admirals under a cloud for participation in an appalling
corruption-cum-espionage scandal, while our fleet in 2017 demonstrated
that it has lost grip on basic navigation at sea, with fatal
results.]{.underline} Considering the U.S. Navy has been the guarantor
of freedom of navigation on the world's seas since 1945, the protector
of international trade and the backbone of American hegemony, its sad
decline has far-reaching consequences.

That said, [[our Army is]{.mark} equally [unready for battle]{.mark}
against a peer.]{.underline} In its shadow war in eastern Ukraine,
Russia's ground forces have demonstrated killing capabilities far beyond
what America and NATO can do. The combination of Russian long-range
artillery and electronic warfare has obliterated whole Ukrainian
battalions, and right now they would do the same to the U.S. Army. Grave
underinvestment in field artillery and electronic warfare hangs over our
army. Russia has excelled at artillery for centuries, and that arm is
the great killer on the modern battlefield. Armies that go into battle
outgunned by the Russians historically get blasted off the field with
heavy casualties. Right now, the U.S. Army is frantically playing
catch-up so it can take on the Russians as equals if it comes to a
fight.

Our army's opening performance has often been subpar, as demonstrated by
defeats like Kasserine Pass and Task Force Smith. However, America
always had time on our side to turn it around. We may not if the
battlefield is in the Baltics, which the Russians may overrun in a
couple days, before the U.S. Army has a chance to stop the invader.
These are the scenarios that keep Pentagon planners up at night as we
enter the new year.

Above all, Trump's go-it-alone attitude is precisely the wrong take as
American hegemony disappears[.]{.underline} Some empires decline slowly,
others fall fast after a major defeat; history is filled with both
outcomes. Since 1945, Washington has presumed that it can deploy our
military anywhere, at the time and place of our choosing, thanks to our
dominance of the world's skies and oceans. Even in a worst case, we
could always get our forces home. This should no longer be assumed. The
world has changed, [[American hegemony **has
collapsed**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and if it's not careful Washington may
find out the hard way. Let's hope cooler and wiser heads prevail in
2018.

#### Hegemony is collapsing now due to Trump-- [economic contradictions]{.underline}, [tensions with NATO]{.underline}, and [cultural contradictions]{.underline} prove its terminally unsustainable.

Power Will Decline Under Trump, Says Futurist Who Predicted Soviet
Collapse" Published: December 6, 2016. Accessed 7/12/18.
(https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/d7ykxx/us-power-will-decline-under-trump-says-futurist-who-predicted-soviet-collapse///dvb)

[Johan Galtung, a Nobel Peace Prize-nominated sociologist who predicted
the collapse of the Soviet Union, warned that [US global power will
collapse under]{.mark} the [Donald Trump]{.mark}
administration]{.underline}. The Norwegian professor at the University
of Hawaii and Transcend Peace University is recognized as the \'founding
father\' of peace and conflict studies as a scientific discipline. [He
has made numerous accurate predictions of major world events, most
notably the collapse of the Soviet Empire. Back in 2000, Galtung first
set out his prediction that the \"US empire\" would collapse within 25
years. Galtung has also accurately predicted the 1978 Iranian
revolution; the Tiananmen Square uprising of 1989 in China; the economic
crises of 1987, 2008 and 2011; and even the 9/11 attacks---among other
events, according to the late Dietrich Fischer, academic director of the
European University Center for Peace Studies]{.underline}. Back in 2000,
Galtung first set out his prediction that the \"US empire\" would
collapse within 25 years. After the election of President Bush, though,
he revised that forecast five years forward because, he argued, Bush\'s
policies of extreme militarism would be an accelerant. [After the
election of Trump, I thought it might be prudent to check in with
Galtung to see how he was feeling about the status of his US forecast.
Galtung told Motherboard that [Trump]{.mark} would probably continue
this trajectory of accelerated decline---and [may even make it]{.mark}
happen [quicker]{.mark}.]{.underline} Of course, with typical scientific
caution, he said he would prefer to see what Trump\'s actual policies
are before voicing a clear verdict. [The model Galtung has doctoral
degrees in both sociology and mathematics, and some decades ago
developed a theory of \"synchronizing and mutually reinforcing
contradictions\", which he used to make his forecasts**. The
[model]{.mark} was [based on comparing the rise and fall of 10
historical empires]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In 1980, Galtung used his
theoretical model to map the interaction of various social
contradictions inside the Soviet empire, leading him to predict its
demise within 10 years. \"Very few believed him at the time\", writes
Dietrich Fischer in the main biography and anthology of Galtung\'s
works, Pioneer for Peace, \"but it occurred on November 9, 1989, two
months before his time limit, 1990.\" [For [the USSR]{.mark}, Galtung\'s
model identified five key [structural contradictions]{.mark} in Soviet
society which, he said, would inevitably [lead to its
fragmentation]{.mark}---unless the USSR underwent a complete
transformation. The model works like this: the more those contradictions
deepen, the greater the likelihood they will result in a social crisis
that could upend the existing order. In the case of the USSR, the main
structural contradictions were as follows: the working class was
increasingly repressed and unable to self-organise through trade unions
(ironic given the country\'s Communist pretensions); the wealthier
\'bourgeoisie\' or elite had money to spend, but nothing to buy from
domestic production, leading to economic stagnation; Russian
intellectuals wanted more freedom of expression; minorities wanted more
autonomy; and peasants wanted more freedom of movement]{.underline} The
model works like this: the more those contradictions deepen, the greater
the likelihood they will result in a social crisis that could upend the
existing order. Eventually, as the highly centralised structures of the
Soviet empire were unable to accommodate these intensifying pressures,
the top-down structures would have to collapse. Galtung later began to
apply his model to the United States. [In 1996, he wrote a scientific
paper published by George Mason University\'s Institute for Conflict
Analysis & Resolution warning that \"the USA will soon go the same way
as \[previous\] imperial constructions... decline and fall.\" Fascism?
But the main book setting out Galtung\'s fascinating forecast for the US
is his 2009 book, The Fall of the American Empire---and then What? The
book sets out a whopping 15 \"synchronizing and mutually reinforcing
contradictions\" afflicting the US, which he says will lead to US global
power ending by 2020---within just four years.]{.underline} Galtung
warned that during this phase of decline, the US was likely to go
through a phase of reactionary \"fascism\". [He argued that American
fascism would come from a capacity for tremendous global violence; a
vision of American exceptionalism as the \"fittest nation\"; a belief in
a coming final war between good and evil; a cult of the strong state
leading the fight of good against evil; and a cult of the \"strong
leader\"]{.underline}. Galtung warned that during this phase of decline,
the US was likely to go through a phase of reactionary \"fascism\". All
of which, Galtung said, surfaced during the Bush era, and which now
appear to have come to fruition through Trump. Such fascism, he told
Motherboard, is a symptom of the decline---lashing out in disbelief at
the loss of power. [Among the [15 structural contradictions]{.mark} his
model identifies as [driving the decline, are]{.mark}: **[economic
contradictions such as \'overproduction relative to demand\']{.mark}**,
**[unemployment]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the [increasing costs of climate
change]{.mark}; [military contradictions including]{.mark} rising
[tensions between the US, NATO,]{.mark}** and its military allies, along
with the increasing economic unsustainability of war; **[political
contradictions including]{.mark} the [conflicting roles of the US, UN
and EU]{.mark}**[;]{.mark} **[cultural contradictions including]{.mark}
[tensions between]{.mark} US [Judeo-Christianity, Islam, and other
minorities]{.mark}**; and **[social contradictions]{.mark}
[encompassing]{.mark} the increasing gulf between [the]{.mark} so-called
[\'American Dream\']{.mark}**, the belief that everyone can prosper in
America through hard work, and the reality of American life (the fact
that more and more people can\'t).]{.underline} Galtung\'s book explores
how the structural inability to resolve such contradictions will lead to
the unravelling of US political power, both globally, and potentially
even domestically. Global collapse Trump has made clear that he thinks
US troops are still needed in Iraq and Afghanistan, and even proposed
sending more troops to Iraq. He also said that we should have
\'grabbed\' the country\'s oil. But he has also heavily (and
incoherently) criticized US military policies. [Domestically, Trump has
promised to deport 11 million illegal migrants, build a wall between the
US and Mexico, compel all American Muslims to sign up to a government
register, and ban all Muslim immigration to the US. On the one hand,
Trump might well offer an opportunity to avoid potential conflicts with
great power rivals like Russia and China---on the other, he may still,
stupidly, fight more unilateral wars and worsen domestic contradictions
relating to minorities. For Galtung, **[Trump\'s]{.mark}
[incoherent]{.mark} policy [proposals]{.mark} [are evidence of]{.mark}
[the deeper structural decline of US power]{.mark}:** \"He \[Trump\]
blunts contradictions with Russia, possibly with China, and seems to do
also with North Korea. But he sharpens contradictions inside the USA\",
such as in relation to minority rights. On the one hand, Galtung said,
Trump might well offer an opportunity to avoid potential conflicts with
great power rivals like Russia and China---on the other, he may still,
stupidly, fight more unilateral wars and worsen domestic contradictions
relating to minorities. Motherboard asked Galtung whether he thinks
Trump would speed up his forecast of \"collapse\", or slow it
down]{.underline}. Even if we give Trump the benefit of the doubt, he
said, and assume that he \"prefers solving underlying conflicts,
particularly with Russia, to war---in other words for the US not be
imperial---then yes, that still speeds up the decline from above, and
from the center... Of course, what he does as a President remains to be
seen[.\" But what exactly is collapsing? \"An empire is more than
violence around the world,\" said Galtung. \"It is a cross-border
structure with a center, the imperial country, and a periphery, the
client countries. The point about imperialism is to make the elites in
the periphery do the jobs for the center.\" The center country may be a
dictatorship or a democracy.]{.underline} So for Galtung, the collapse
of the US empire comes \"when the periphery elites no longer want to
fight US wars, no longer want to exploit for the center.\" [For Galtung,
a key sign of collapse would be Trump\'s attitude to NATO. The
[President-elect has said]{.mark} [he would be happy to see NATO
break-up]{.mark} if US allies aren\'t willing to pay their
dues.]{.underline} Trump\'s \'go it alone\' approach would, Galtung
said, [accelerate and undermine US global empire at the same time. \"The
collapse has two faces,\" said Galtung. \"Other countries refuse to be
\'good allies: and the USA has to do the killing themselves, by bombing
from high altitudes, drones steered by computer from an office, Special
Forces killing all over the place. Both are happening today, except for
Northern Europe, which supports these wars, for now. That will probably
not continue beyond 2020, so I stand by that deadline.\" US break-up?
But this global collapse, also has potential domestic
implications.]{.underline}

its shows of force in maritime territories it disputes with U.S.

So is India. President Trump had scarcely left Europe when Indian prime
minister Modi arrived for a four-country tour, including trade talks and
pledges to strengthen the global order with Germany and --- on the heels
of Trump's Paris climate-deal pullout --- work together on the
environment with France's Macron. At the same time, Indian defense
officials were at a regional meeting pledging assistance to Vietnam's
military. Memories of Indian reluctance to commit on climate, and its
discomfort at Washington's role supporting Vietnam and other Southeast
Asian powers, were fading fast --- as fast as any expectation that
Washington would take the lead again soon, on either front.

#### China and Russia are trying to gain primacy and Trump has left the gate right open

American foreign policy was, if not in crisis, in big trouble. Strong
forces were putting stress on the old global political order:
**[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[rise of China]{.underline}]{.mark}**
to a power with more than half the productive capacity of the United
States (and defense spending to match); the partial **[[recovery
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** a **[[resentful Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**
under a skilled and thuggish autocrat; the discrediting of Western
elites by the financial crash of 2008, followed by roiling populist
waves, of which Trump himself was part; a turbulent Middle East;
economic dislocations worldwide.

An American **[[leadership that had]{.underline}]{.mark}** partly
**[[discredited itself]{.underline}]{.mark}** over the past generation
compounded these problems. The Bush administration's war against
jihadist Islam had been undermined by reports of mistreatment and
torture; its Afghan campaign had been inconclusive; its invasion of Iraq
had been deeply compromised by what turned out to be a false premise and
three years of initial mismanagement.

These circumstances would have caused severe headaches for a competent
and sophisticated successor. Instead, the **[[United States got a
president who had unnervingly promised a wall on the]{.mark} southern
[border]{.mark}]{.underline}** (paid for by Mexico), the dismantlement
of long**[-[standing trade deals with]{.mark} both [competitors and
partners]{.mark},]{.underline}** a closer relationship with Vladimir
Putin, and a ban on Muslims coming into the United States.

#### Trump is the root cause of the erosion of US hegemony resulting in multipolarity

There are good reasons for any good progressive to bemoan the presence
of the **[[childish, racist, sexist and ecocidal]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
right-wing plutocrat Donald **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the
White House. One complaint about Trump that should be held at
arm's-length by anyone on the left, however, is the charge that Trump is
**[[contributing to the decline of U.S. global
power]{.underline}]{.mark}**---to the erosion of the United States'
superpower status and the emergence of a more multipolar world.

This criticism of Trump comes from different elite corners. Last
October, the leading neoconservative foreign policy intellectual and
former George W. Bush administration adviser Eliot Cohen wrote
an Atlantic magazine essay titled "[How **[Trump Is Ending the American
Era.]{.underline}**]{.mark}" Cohen recounted numerous ways in which
Trump had reduced "America's standing **[[and ability to influence
global affairs."]{.underline}]{.mark}** He worried that Trump's
presidency would leave "America's position in the world stunted" and an
"America **[[lacking confidence" on the global
stage.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

I recently reviewed a manuscript on the rise of Trump written by a
left-liberal American sociologist. Near the end of this forthcoming and
mostly excellent and instructive volume, the author finds it "worrisome"
that other nations see the U.S. "abdicating its role as the world's
leading policeman" under Trump---and that, "given what we have seen so
far from the \[Trump\] administration, U.S.
**[[heg]{.underline}]{.mark}**emony appears to **[[be on shakier ground
than it has been]{.underline}]{.mark}** in a long time."

For the purposes of this report, I'll leave aside the matter of whether
**[[Trump is]{.mark},]{.underline}** in fact**[, [speeding the decline
of U.S. global power]{.mark}]{.underline}** (he undoubtedly is) and how
he's doing that to focus instead on a very different question: What
would be so awful about the end of "the American Era"---the seven-plus
decades of U.S. global economic and related military supremacy between
1945 and the present? Why should the world mourn the "premature" end of
the "American Century"?

**Switzer 16** (Tom Switzer, Former editor of the Spectator Australia,
opinion editor of The Australian, editorial writer at the Australian
Financial Review and assistant editor at the American Enterprise
Institute in Washington, DC, Former senior fellow at the United States
Studies Centre at the University of Sydney**.** 21 June 2016. "Why
Donald Trump Should Embrace Offshore Balancing"
<http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/why-donald-trump-should-embrace-offshore-balancing-16661>)

[[Great sea changes of foreign policy]{.mark} thought [are
rare]{.mark}]{.underline} in American public life. But [there's abundant
evidence that the US is experiencing one now]{.underline}. Polls show
that the [American people are]{.underline} [tired of the
world](http://www.people-press.org/2016/05/05/public-uncertain-divided-over-americas-place-in-the-world/),
with a [majority believing that it's high time for the nation to
concentrate on its]{.underline} own neglected [internal problems. The
[defense budget]{.mark} has fallen]{.underline} [and [will continue to
fall]{.mark}]{.underline}, and there's a strong aversion to seeing US
soldiers killed and wounded. To the extent that such views prevail,
they're inimical to the post-Cold War consensus that the US should
impose its will and leadership across the globe. Enter Donald Trump,
whose divisive rhetoric and rude-and-crude behavior shouldn't disguise
the fact that he has caught the significance of the new mood. Like
Bernie Sanders, [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} found a receptive primary
campaign audience whenever he [[questioned America's propensity for
promoting democracy and subsidizing allies'
defenses]{.mark}.]{.underline} And, unlike Hillary Clinton, [he
[recognizes that US military interventions]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
Middle East [all too often [make a bad situation
worse]{.mark}]{.underline}, getting America bogged down in sectarian
wars while radicalizing a new generation of jihadist. If a foreign
policy keeps hurting US interests and making the world a far more
dangerous place, then some new thinking is in order. Unfortunately,
Trump's failed to match his shrewd instincts with any policy substance.
He could do worse than consult an [important
article](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2016-06-13/case-offshore-balancing)
in the latest Foreign Affairs magazine. John Mearsheimer from the
University of Chicago and Stephen Walt from Harvard University are two
of America's most distinguished scholars of international relations.
Neither will vote for Trump or work for his administration if he's
elected in November. Nonetheless, they agree with Trump in his rejection
of idealistic crusades. As the US interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq and
Libya have shown, [there's not an American solution to every
problem]{.underline}. In fact, [there are a good many problems, for
which there may be no solution at all]{.underline}. They also agree that
"[[free riders]{.mark}"---]{.underline}allies whose security relies
overwhelmingly on US largesse---[are a [consequence o]{.mark}f the
post-Cold War strategy of global liberal [heg]{.mark}emony.]{.underline}
Mearsheimer and Walt instead propose a policy of [offshore
balancing]{.underline}, which [concentrates on preserving US hegemony in
the Western Hemisphere and preventing the rise of hegemonic powers in
Europe, Asia and the Persian Gulf]{.underline}. In deciding when to
deploy military power, they argue, the [US should allow problems to be
handed to those closest to the problem]{.underline}. This way[**, a
[sense of responsibility and initiative can be developed throughout the
international system]{.mark}** and the US can reserve its own
intervention for the great issues, acting]{.underline} [as a balancer of
last resort]{.underline} rather than what Madeleine Albright called an
'indispensable nation'. In practice, that means that the **[[US should
get out of Europe and turn NATO over to the Europeans, as Trump himself
suggests]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Russia]{.underline}, after all, [is a
declining power]{.underline}, [whose actions]{.underline} in the Baltics
[are more reactive]{.underline} to western policy (NATO expansion, for
instance) [than aggressive. In the Persian Gulf, the US should aim to
prevent Iran, the only rising power in the region, from becoming a
hegemon via a limited rapprochement.]{.underline} (Egypt, Syria, Israel
aren't vital strategic interests.) Meanwhile, [acting as a balancer of
last resort in the Middle East would ameliorate America's terrorism
problem]{.underline}. Why? Because [such a policy]{.underline} respects
the sovereignty of other states and [doesn't trigger nationalist
anger]{.underline} [at the US,]{.underline} [which is one of the main
driving forces behind jihadism]{.underline}. Asia's different. The rise
of China, Mearsheimer and Walt suggest, is bound to threaten the
regional equilibrium, so US military force will be needed in the region
more than ever. That's especially so, given that US allies are unable or
unwilling to balance Beijing's hegemonic ambitions on their own. [None
of this means abandoning America's position as the world's greatest
power or retreating to a form of isolationism]{.underline}. It means
that although the US can afford to scale back somewhat and force other
states to bear a fairer share of global burdens, [Washington will need
to remain the balancer of last resort]{.underline} in those
strategically important regions. **[By [being more discriminating,
selective and prudent, a policy of offshore balancing will prevent
rivals from dominating key regions of the world]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[and preserve US primacy over the long haul]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
Trump should embrace the Mearsheimer--Walt thesis, which would be manna
from heaven.

#### **American power is collapsing -- dollar hegemony can't prevent this**

**Shea 5/28** (Rainer Shea, a political jounalist for multiple
companies, uses the written word to construct establishment propaganda
to promomte meaningful political actions. 28 May 2019. \"It May Not Be
Fully Visible, But We're in the Final Years of the American
Empire\"https://ghionjournal.com/it-may-not-be-fully-visible-but-were-in-the-final-years-of-the-american-empire/)

[The United States has reached a point where its entire claim to global
hegemony is based on a series of increasingly fragile geopolitical
alliances, and on a worldwide military presence that can't be sustained
for much longer]{.underline}. As the political writer Dmitry Orlov said
in an interview last month: "I think that [[the American empire is very
much over already]{.underline}]{.mark}, but it hasn't been put to any
sort of serious stress test yet, and so [nobody realizes that this is
the case]{.underline}." The last few years of military budget
expansions, war campaigns against Iran and Venezuela, and attempts to
strong-arm Russia and China are all part of the American empire's
reaction to this fragility. So is the fact that the United States has,
with the "War on Terror", been at war for the last 18 years. Throughout
this time, the American empire has been in a state similar to that of
the British empire after it attacked Egypt in 1956, or to that of the
Athenian empire during the Peloponnesian War of 431--404 B.C. When these
empires launched their great military adventures, each experienced a
rapid decline in their ability to maintain the power structures they'd
created, and soon they were no longer dominant. The same has been
happening to the U.S. since the start of its disastrous invasions of
Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003. [[Endless wars]{.mark} and
military expansions [have drained]{.mark} the [U.S.]{.mark}
[economy]{.mark} while the Great Recession and increasing income
inequality have further impeded the country's ability to function
economically. [The U.S. has lost]{.mark} most of its [ability to
persuade]{.mark} formerly loyal [countries to serve its foreign policy
goals]{.mark}]{.underline}; the Trump administration's push for war with
Iran is getting support only from Saudi Arabia and Israel, with the
international community overwhelmingly rejecting Trump's Iran agenda.
[Overall, the hand that America plays during its regime change attempts
is now decrepit and increasingly ineffectual; [the U.S. has ended up
isolating itself]{.mark}]{.underline} on the world stage by engineering
Juan Guaido's illegal coup attempt in Venezuela, with 75% of the world's
countries backing current president Maduro. And in a world that's become
multipolar, [[Russia and China have]{.mark} lately been [outmaneuvering
the U.S. economically and militarily]{.mark}]{.underline}. Their recent
rapid moves to protect Venezuela from a U.S. invasion are but one
example. The U.S. still can still do great damage through sanctions---as
it's doing right now in Syria and Venezuela---and its military remains
the largest in the world. [But [without]{.mark} strong international
[support]{.mark} [or an economy that works]{.mark} properly, [the
country is only retaining its power through violence]{.mark} and
military buildup]{.underline}. This knee-jerk reliance on hard power has
made U.S. an international outlaw whose government is widely hated and
distrusted, both at home and abroad. Mass revolt against it could easily
break out in the coming years, as working class discontent reaches a
boiling point. None of this is hyperbole. In 2017, a Pentagon report
stated that [[American power "is not merely fraying but]{.mark} may, in
fact, be [collapsing.]{.mark}"]{.underline} The report even recommended
that the government try to maintain its control through propaganda,
increased surveillance, and more military expansionism, which it has.

#### Heg [unsustainable]{.underline} -- they don't solve -- political [polarization]{.underline}, not economic slowdown or international challengers

**Tozzo 18** - Lecturer at Trent University, Canada, where he teaches
methodology, US politics and International Relations (Brandon Tozzo;
"American Hegemony after the Great Recession"; pgs. 3-4///dvb

Secondly, and most critically, this book will intervene in a debate on
the future of American hegemony. The **[response of the USA to the
crisis has developed a contradiction]{.underline}**: the **[main threat
to]{.underline}** American **[hegemony is]{.underline}** not
**[from]{.underline}** the global capitalist system, nor from foreign
competitors, but **[its political system]{.underline}**. Since the
Second World War, the USA has been the hegemon of the international
capitalist system-promoting free trade, market liberalism and a central
player in many international institutions. **[[Polarization is common in
American politic]{.mark}s]{.underline}**. The [**[American public
is]{.underline}** **[divided on a wide array of social and economic
issues]{.underline}**: w]{.mark}hether the state should promote
**[school prayer, women\'s access to abortion, the role of government in
health care and same-sex marriage.]{.underline}** While each of these
issues is significant in their own right, they have not had global
ramifications. Since the onset of the Great Recession **[[conflict has
expanded into areas that were previously non-politicized or where there
was cross-party consensus]{.underline}]{.mark}**. With an
**[increasingly ideologically divided Congress, the rise of the Tea
Party, and the success of Donald Trump in 2016, Americans are now
seriously debating whether the USA should remain committed to global
free trade and open markets]{.underline}**, and whether America should
continue to maintain its role in institutions like NATO (the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization). However, **[despite the
politics]{.underline}**, the **[USA currently has low unemployment,
decreasing budget deficits and a booming stock market]{.underline}**.
Compared to other countries, the USA has come out the Great Recession in
a stronger position than its major contenders. My **[analysis is not
that America lacks the economic resources or policy tools]{.underline}**
to manage contradictions in capitalism or international crisis,
**[but]{.underline}**, the **[[crisis has shown the American political
system is becoming increasingly unwilling due to
politic]{.mark}s]{.underline}**. To put the overall thesis of this book
succinctly, the **[[greatest threat to American
hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the stability of global capitalism
in the twenty-first century **[is America.]{.underline}** I will also
provide an analysis of the **[m[ajor challengers on
an]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[international stage to American
hegemony]{.underline}**]{.mark} in order to show that they **[[suffer
from significant institutional, political and economic
problems]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In Europe, the institutional framework
of the EU and the Euro has constrained both wealthier northern countries
and the economically weak south. While the economic crisis in Southern
European countries is abated through loans, along with austerity
measures, politically, there is little popular will to increase the
political unity of Europe. On the contrary, years of recession, a
migration crisis from the Middle East and the rise of right-wing
nationalist parties have made many Europeans far more sceptical of
\"Project Europe\". The Recession has shown the fissures within the
European Union, along geographic lines. In 2016, Britain voted for a
\"Brexit\" from the European Union, and while the details have yet to be
worked out, this is a worrying sign for future integration in Europe. It
continues to be unlikely Europe will be able to seriously contend with
the USA as a unified global superpower in the near future.

### Impact D - No Impact

#### No impact to heg- US intervention, military spending and activism have no influence on levels of peace- their evidence is psychologically biased

**Fettweis** **5-8-17**

(Christopher J.-assistant professor of political science at Tulane
University. "Unipolarity, Hegemony, and the New Peace" Published in
Security Studies Vol 26 No 3.
http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09636412.2017.1306394?src=recsys&journalCode=fsst20)

[Even the most ardent supporters of the hegemonic-stability explanation
do not contend that US influence extends equally to all corners of the
globe]{.underline}. [The United States has concentrated its policing
in]{.underline} what George Kennan used to call "[strong points," or the
most important parts of the world:]{.underline} [Western Europe, the
Pacific Rim, and Persian Gulf]{.underline}.64 By doing so, Washington
may well have contributed more to great power peace than the overall
global decline in warfare. If the former phenomenon contributed to the
latter, by essentially providing a behavioral model for weaker states to
emulate, then perhaps this lends some support to the hegemonic-stability
case.65 During the Cold War, the United States played referee to a few
intra-West squabbles, especially between Greece and Turkey, and provided
Hobbesian reassurance to Germany's nervous neighbors. [Other, equally
plausible explanations exist for stability in the first world, including
the presence of a common enemy, democracy, economic interdependence,
general war aversion, etc]{.underline}. The looming presence of the
leviathan is certainly among these plausible explanations, but only
inside the US sphere of influence. Bipolarity was bad for the nonaligned
world, where Soviet and Western intervention routinely exacerbated local
conflicts. Unipolarity has generally been much better, but whether or
not this was due to US action is again unclear. Overall US interest in
the affairs of the Global South has dropped markedly since the end of
the Cold War, as has the level of violence in almost all regions. [There
is less US intervention in the political and military affairs of Latin
America compared to any time in the twentieth century, for instance, and
also less conflict]{.underline}. [Warfare in Africa is at an all-time
low, as is relative US interest outside of counterterrorism and security
assistanc]{.underline}e.66 **[Regional peace and [stability exist where
there is US]{.mark} active [intervention, as well as]{.mark} where there
is [not. No]{.mark} direct [relationship]{.mark} seems to [exist across
regions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. If intervention can be considered a
function of direct and indirect activity, of both political and military
action, a regional picture might look like what is outlined in Table 1.
These assessments of conflict are by necessity relative, because there
has not been a "high" level of conflict in any region outside the Middle
East during the period of the New Peace. Putting aside for the moment
that important caveat, some points become clear. [The great powers of
the world are clustered in the upper right quadrant, where US
intervention has been high, but conflict levels low. US intervention is
imperfectly correlated with stability]{.underline}, however. Indeed, it
is conceivable that the **[relatively [high]{.mark} level of [US]{.mark}
interest and [activity]{.mark} has [made]{.mark} the [security]{.mark}
situation [in]{.mark} the Persian Gulf and broader [Middle East
worse]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} In recent years, [substantial
hard power investments]{.underline} ([Somalia, Afghanistan, Iraq),
moderate intervention (Libya), and reliance on diplomacy (Syria) have
been equally ineffective in stabilizing states torn by
conflict]{.underline}. While it is possible that the region is
essentially unpacifiable and no amount of police work would bring peace
to its people, [it remains hard to make the case that the US presence
has improved matters. In this "strong point," at least, US hegemony has
failed to bring peace.]{.underline} In much of the rest of the world,
the United States has not been especially eager to enforce any
particular rules. Even rather incontrovertible evidence of genocide has
not been enough to inspire action. Washington's [intervention choices
have at best been erratic]{.underline}; Libya and Kosovo brought about
action, but much more blood flowed uninterrupted in Rwanda, Darfur,
Congo, Sri Lanka, and Syria. [The US record of peacemaking is not
exactly a long uninterrupted string of successes]{.underline}. During
the turn-of-the-century conventional war between Ethiopia and Eritrea, a
highlevel US delegation containing former and future National Security
Advisors (Anthony Lake and Susan Rice) made a half-dozen trips to the
region, but was unable to prevent either the outbreak or recurrence of
the conflict. Lake and his team shuttled back and forth between the
capitals with some frequency, and President Clinton made repeated phone
calls to the leaders of the respective countries, offering to hold peace
talks in the United States, all to no avail.67 The war ended in late
2000 when Ethiopia essentially won, and it controls the disputed
territory to this day. The Horn of Africa is hardly the only region
where states are free to fight one another today without fear of serious
US involvement. Since they are choosing not to do so with increasing
frequency, something else is probably affecting their calculations.
[Stability exists even in those places where the potential for
intervention by the sheriff is minimal. Hegemonic stability can only
take credit for influencing those decisions that would have ended in war
without the presence, whether physical or psychological, of the United
States]{.underline}. **[It seems hard to make the case that the relative
peace that has descended on so many regions is primarily due to the kind
of heavy hand of the neoconservative leviathan,]{.underline}** or its
lighter, more liberal cousin. [Something else appears to be at
work.]{.underline} Conflict and US Military Spending How does one
measure polarity? Power is traditionally considered to be some
combination of military and economic strength, but despite scores of
efforts, no widely accepted formula exists[. Perhaps overall military
spending might be thought of as a proxy for hard power
capabilities]{.underline}; [perhaps too the amount of money the United
States devotes to hard power is a reflection of the strength of the
unipole]{.underline}. When compared to conflict levels, however,
**[there is [no]{.mark} obvious correlation, and certainly not the kind
of [negative relationship between US spending and conflict]{.mark} that
many [hegemonic stability theorists would expect]{.mark} to
see]{.underline}**. [During the 1990s, the United States cut back on
defense by about 25 percent]{.underline}, [spending \$100 billion less
in real terms in 1998]{.underline} [that it did in 1990]{.underline}.68
To those believers in the neoconservative version of hegemonic
stability, this irresponsible "peace dividend" endangered both national
and global security. "[No serious analyst of American military
capabilities doubts that the defense budget has been cut much too far to
meet America's responsibilities to itself and to world
peace,]{.underline}" argued Kristol and Kagan at the time.69 **[[The
world grew dramatically more peaceful while the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [cut]{.mark} its [forces]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
however, [and stayed just as peaceful while spending rebounded after the
9/11 terrorist attacks**. The incidence and magnitude of global conflict
declined while the military budget was cut**]{.underline} [under
President Clinton, in other words]{.underline}, **[and kept
declining]{.underline}** (though more slowly, since levels were already
low) as the Bush administration ramped it back up. [Overall US military
spending has varied during the period of the New Peace from a low in
constant dollars of less than \$400 billion to a high of more than \$700
billion, but war does not seem to have noticed]{.underline}. [The same
nonrelationship exists between other potential proxy measurements for
hegemony and conflict]{.underline}: **[[there does not seem to
be]{.mark} much [connection between warfare]{.mark} and fluctuations in
[US GDP, alliance commitments, and forward military
presence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [There was very little fighting in
Europe when there were 300,000 US troops stationed there, for example,
and that has not changed as the number of Americans dwindled by 90
percent.]{.underline} Overall, **[there does not seem to be much
correlation between US actions and systemic stability]{.underline}**.
[Nothing the United States actually does seems to matter to the New
Peace]{.underline}. It is possible that absolute military spending might
not be as important to explain the phenomenon as relative. Although
Washington cut back on spending during the 1990s, its relative advantage
never wavered. The United States has accounted for between 35 and 41
percent of global military spending every year since the collapse of the
Soviet Union.70 The perception of relative US power might be the
decisive factor in decisions made in other capitals. One cannot rule out
the possibility that it is the perception of US power---and its
willingness to use it---that keeps the peace. In other words, [perhaps
it is the grand strategy of the United States, rather than its absolute
capability, that is decisive in maintaining stability. It is that to
which we now turn]{.underline}. Conflict and US Grand Strategy The
perception of US power, and the strength of its hegemony, is to some
degree a function of grand strategy. [If indeed US strategic choices are
responsible for the New Peace, then variation in those choices ought to
have consequences for the level of international conflict]{.underline}.
[A restrained United States is much less likely to play the role of
sheriff than one following a more activist approach]{.underline}. Were
the unipole to follow such a path, hegemonic-stability theorists warn,
disaster would follow. Former National Security Advisor Zbigniew
Brzezinski spoke for many when he warned that "outright chaos" could be
expected to follow a loss of hegemony, including a string of quite
specific issues, including new or renewed attempts to build regional
empires (by China, Turkey, Russia, and Brazil) and the collapse of the
US relationship with Mexico, as emboldened nationalists south of the
border reassert 150-year-old territorial claims. Overall, without US
dominance, today's relatively peaceful world would turn "violent and
bloodthirsty." 71 Niall Ferguson foresees a post-hegemonic "Dark Age" in
which "plunderers and pirates" target the big coastal cities like New
York and Rotterdam, terrorists attack cruise liners and aircraft
carriers alike, and the "wretchedly poor citizens" of Latin America are
unable to resist the Protestantism brought to them by US evangelicals.
Following the multiple (regional, fortunately) nuclear wars and plagues,
the few remaining airlines would be forced to suspend service to all but
the very richest cities.72 These are somewhat extreme versions of a
central assumption of all hegemonic-stability theorists: a restrained
United States would be accompanied by utter disaster. The "present
danger" of which Kristol, Kagan, and their fellow travelers warn is that
the United States "will shrink its responsibilities and---in a fit of
absentmindedness, or parsimony, or indifference--- allow the
international order that it created and sustains to collapse." 73
Liberals fear restraint as well, and also warn that a militarized
version of primacy would be counterproductive in the long run. Although
they believe that the rule-based order established by United States is
more durable than the relatively fragile order discussed by the
neoconservatives, liberals argue that Washington can undermine its
creation over time through thoughtless unilateral actions that violate
those rules. Many predicted that the invasion of Iraq and its general
contempt for international institutions and law would call the
legitimacy of the order into question. G. John Ikenberry worried that
Bush's "geostrategic wrecking ball" would lead to a more hostile,
divided, and dangerous world.74 [Thus while all hegemonicstability
theorists expect a rise of chaos during a restrained presidency,
liberals also have grave concerns regarding primacy]{.underline}.
Overall, if either version is correct and global stability is provided
by US hegemony, [then maintaining that stability through a grand
strategy based on either primacy (to neoconservatives) or "deep
engagement" (to liberals) is clearly a wise choice]{.underline}.75 If,
however, US actions are only tangentially related to the outbreak of the
New Peace, or if any of the other proposed explanations are decisive,
then the United States can retrench without fear of negative
consequences. [The grand strategy of the United States is therefore
crucial to beliefs in hegemonic stability]{.underline} Although few
observers would agree on the details, most would probably acknowledge
that [post-Cold War grand strategies of American presidents have
differed in some important ways]{.underline}. The four administrations
are reasonable representations of the four ideal types outlined by Barry
R. Posen and Andrew L. Ross in 1996.76 Under George H. W.
[Bush]{.underline}, the United States [followed]{.underline} the path of
"[selective engagement]{.underline}," which is sometimes referred to as
"balance-of-power realism"; Bill [Clinton's]{.underline} grand strategy
[looks]{.underline} a great deal [like]{.underline} what Posen and Ross
call "[cooperative security," and others call "liberal
internationalism]{.underline}"; George W. [Bush]{.underline}, especially
in his first term, [forged a strategy that was as close to "primacy" as
any president is likely to get]{.underline}; and Barack
[Obama]{.underline}, despite some early flirtation with liberalism, has
[followed a restrained realist path, which Posen and Ross label
"neo-isolationism" but its proponents refer to as "strategic
restraint]{.underline}." [77 In no case did the various anticipated
disorders materialize**.**]{.underline} As Table 2 demonstrates,
**[[armed conflict levels fell steadily, irrespective of]{.mark} the
[grand]{.mark} strategic [path Washington chose]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
[Neither the primacy of George W. Bush nor the restraint of Barack Obama
had much effect on the level of global violence]{.underline}. Despite
continued warnings (and the high-profile mess in Syria), [the world has
not experienced an increase in violence while the United States chose
uninvolvement]{.underline}. If the grand strategy of the United States
is responsible for the New Peace, it is leaving no trace in the
evidence. Perhaps we should not expect a correlation to show up in this
kind of analysis. While US behavior might have varied in the margins
during this period, nether its relative advantage over its nearest
rivals nor its commitments waivered in any important way. However, it is
surely worth noting that if trends opposite to those discussed in the
previous two sections had unfolded, if other states had reacted
differently to fluctuations in either US military spending or grand
strategy, then surely hegemonic stability theorists would argue that
their expectations had been fulfilled. [Many liberals were on the
lookout for chaos while George W. Bush was in the White House, just as
neoconservatives have been quick to identify apparent worldwide
catastrophe under President Obama]{.underline}.78 [If increases in
violence would have been evidence for the wisdom of hegemonic
strategies, then logical consistency demands that the lack thereof
should at least pose a problem]{.underline}. As it stands, [the only
evidence we have regarding the relationship between US power and
international stability suggests that the two are unrelated. The rest of
the world appears quite capable and willing to operate effectively
without the presence of a global policeman]{.underline}. [Those who
think otherwise have precious little empirical support upon which to
build their case.]{.underline} Hegemonic stability is a belief, in other
words, rather than an established fact, and as such deserves a different
kind of examination. The Political Psychology of Unipolarity Evidence
supporting the notion that US power is primarily responsible for the New
Peace is slim, but belief in the connection is quite strong, especially
in policy circles. The best arena to examine the proposition is
therefore not the world of measurable rationality, but rather that of
the human mind. **[[Political psychology can shed more light on
unipolarity than]{.mark} can any collection of [data]{.mark} or
evidence]{.underline}**. [Just because an outcome is primarily
psychological does not mean that it is less real]{.underline};
[perception quickly becomes reality]{.underline} for both the unipolar
state and those in the periphery. If all actors believe that the United
States provides security and stability for the system, then behavior can
be affected. [Beliefs have deep explanatory power in international
politics whether they have a firm foundation in empirical reality or
not.]{.underline} Like all beliefs, faith in the stability provided by
hegemony is rarely subjected to much analysis.79 Although they almost
always have some basis in reality, beliefs need not pass rigorous tests
to prove that they match it. No amount of evidence has been able to
convince some people that vaccines do not cause autism, for example, or
that the world is more peaceful than at any time before, or that the
climate is changing due to human activity. Ultimately, as Robert Jervis
explains, "we often believe as much in the face of evidence as because
of it." 80 Facts may change, but beliefs remain the same. [When leaders
are motivated to act based on unjustified, inaccurate beliefs, folly
often follows]{.underline}. The person who decides to take a big risk
because of astrological advice in the morning's horoscope can benefit
from baseless superstition if the risk pays off. Probability and luck
suggest that successful policy choices can sometimes flow from incorrect
beliefs. Far more often, however, poor intellectual foundations lead to
suboptimal or even disastrous outcomes. It is worthwhile to analyze the
foundations of even our most deeply held beliefs to determine which ones
are good candidates to inspire poor policy choices in those who hold
them. People are wonderful rationalizers. There is much to be said for
being the strongest country in the world; their status provides
Americans both security and psychological rewards, as well as strong
incentives to construct a rationale for preserving the unipolar moment
that goes beyond mere selfishness. Since people enjoy being "number
one," they are susceptible to perceiving reality in ways that brings the
data in line with their desires. [It is no coincidence that most
hegemonic stability theorists are American]{.underline}.81 Perhaps the
satisfaction that comes with being the unipolar power has inspired
Americans to misperceive the positive role that their status plays in
the world. Three findings from political psychology can shed light on
perceptions of hegemonic stability. [They are mutually supportive, and,
when taken together, suggest that it is likely that US policymakers
overestimate the extent to which their actions are responsible for the
choices of others.]{.underline} The belief in the major US contribution
to world peace is probably unjustified. The Illusion of Control Could 5
percent of the world's population hope to enforce rules upon the rest?
Would even an internationally hegemonic United States be capable of
producing the New Peace? Perhaps, but it also may be true that
[believers in hegemonic stability may be affected by the very common
tendency of people to overestimate their ability to control
events.]{.underline} A variety of evidence has accumulated over the past
forty years to support Ellen J. Langer's original observations about
[the "illusion of control" that routinely distorts
perception]{.underline}.82 [Even in situations where outcomes are
clearly generated by pure chance, people tend to believe that they can
exert control over even]{.underline}ts.83 There is little reason to
believe that leaders are somehow less susceptible to such illusions than
subjects in controlled experiments. The extensive research on the
illusion of control has revealed two further findings that suggest US
illusions might be even stronger than average. First, [misperceptions of
control appear to be correlated with power]{.underline}: individuals
with higher socioeconomic status, as well as those who are members of
dominant groups, are more likely to overestimate their ability to
control events.84 [Powerful people tend to be far more confident than
others, often overly so, and that confidence leads them to inflate their
own importance.]{.underline}85 [Leaders of superpowers are thus
particularly vulnerable to distorted perceptions regarding their ability
to affect the course of events. **[US observers had]{.mark} a greater
[structural predisposition]{.mark}**]{.underline} than others, for
example, [**[to believe that they would have been able to control
events]{.underline}**]{.mark} in the Persian Gulf following an injection
of creative instability in 2003. The skepticism of less powerful allies
was easily discounted. Second, there is reason to believe that culture
matters as well as power. P[eople from societies that value
individualism are more likely to harbor illusions of control than those
from collectivist societies, where assumptions of group agency are more
common]{.underline}. When compared to people from other parts of the
world, Westerners tend to view the world as "highly subject to personal
control," in the words of Richard Nisbett.86 North Americans appear
particularly vulnerable in this regard.87 [Those who come from
relatively powerful countries with individualistic societies are
therefore at high risk for misperceiving their ability to influence
events]{.underline}. For the United States, the illusion of control
extends beyond the water's edge. An oft-discussed public good supposedly
conferred by US hegemony is order in those parts of the world
uncontrolled by sovereign states, or the "global commons." 88 One such
common area is the sea, where the United States maintains the only true
blue-water navy in the world. That the United States has brought this
peace to the high seas is a central belief of hegemonic-stability
theorists, one rarely examined in any serious way. Indeed the maritime
environment has been unusually peaceful for decades; the biggest naval
battles since Okinawa took place during the Falklands conflict in 1982,
and they were fairly minor.89 If hegemony is the key variable explaining
stability at sea, maritime security would have to be far more chaotic
without the US Navy. [It is equally if not more plausible to suggest,
however, that the reason other states are not building blue-water navies
is not because the United States dissuades them from doing so but rather
because none feels that trade is imperiled]{.underline}.90 In earlier
times, and certainly during the age of mercantilism, zero-sum economics
inspired efforts to cut off the trade of opponents on occasion, making
control the sea extremely important. [Today the free flow of goods is
vital to all economies, and it would be in the interest of no state to
interrupt it]{.underline}.91 Free trade at sea may no longer need
protection, in other words, because it essentially has no enemies; [the
sheriff may be patrolling a crime-free neighborhood.]{.underline} The
threat from the few remaining pirates hardly requires a robust naval
presence, and is certainly not what hegemonic-stability advocates mean
when they compare the role played by the US Navy in 2016 to that of the
Royal Navy in 1816. It is at least possible that shared interest in
open, free commons keeps the peace at sea rather than the United States.
Oceans unpatrolled by the US Navy may be about as stable as they are
with the presence of its carriers. The degree to which 273 active-duty
ships exert control over vast common parts is not at all clear. People
overestimate the degree to which they control events in their lives.
Furthermore, if these observations from political psychology are right
about the factors that influence the growth of illusions of power, then
**[US leaders and analysts are particularly susceptible to
misperception]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} [They may well be overestimating
the degree to which the United States can affect the behavior of
others]{.underline}. The rest of the world may be able to get along just
fine, on land and at sea, without US attempts to control it. Ego-Centric
and Self-Serving Biases in Attribution I[t is natural for people,
whether presidents or commoners, to misperceive the role they play in
the thinking process of others. Jervis was the first to discuss this
phenomenon, now known as the "ego-centric bias," which has been put to
the test many times since he wrote four decades ago]{.underline}.
Building on what was known as "attribution theory," Jervis observed that
actors tend to overestimate their importance in the decisions of others.
Rarely are our actions as consequential upon their behavior as we
believe them to be.92 [This is not merely ego gratification, though that
plays a role; actors are simply more conscious of their own actions than
the other factors central to the internal deliberations in other
capitals]{.underline}. Because people are more likely to remember their
contributions to an outcome, they naturally grant themselves more causal
weight.93 [**Two further aspects of the ego-centric bias make US
analysts even more susceptible to its effects.** First, the
[bias]{.mark} is [magnified when]{.mark} the [behavior]{.mark} of others
[is desirable]{.mark}]{.underline}. People generally take credit for
positive outcomes and deflect responsibility for negative ones. [This
"self-serving bias" is one of the best-established findings in modern
psychology, supported by many hundreds of studies.94]{.underline}
Supporters of Ronald Reagan are happy to give him credit for ending the
Cold War, for instance, even though evidence that the United States had
much influence on Premier Gorbachev's decision making is scant at
best.95 Today, since few outcomes are more desirable than global
stability, it stands to reason [that perceptions of the New Peace are
prime candidates for distortion by ego-centric, self-serving biases.
When war breaks out, it is not the fault of US leaders; when peace comes
to a region, Washington is happy to take credit]{.underline}. There was
for some time a debate among psychologists over just how universal
self-serving biases were, or whether their effects varied across
cultures. [Extensive research has essentially settled the
matter,]{.underline} to the extent that academic questions can ever be
settled: [a direct relationship appears to exist between cultural
individualism and susceptibility to the bias, perhaps because of the
value individualistic societies place on self-enhancement]{.underline}
(as opposed to self-effacement).96 Actors from more collectivist
societies tend to have their egos rewarded in different ways, such as
through contributions to the community and connections to others. People
from Western countries are far more likely to take credit for positive
outcomes than those from Eastern, in other words, and subjects in the
United States tower over the rest of the West. US leaders are therefore
more culturally predisposed to believe that their actions are
responsible for positive outcomes like peace. [Second, self-[perception
is]{.mark} directly [related to egocentric]{.mark} attributions.
Individuals with high self-esteem are more likely to believe that they
are at the center of the decision-making process of others than those
who think somewhat more modestly]{.underline}.97 Leaders of any unipolar
state may well be more likely to hold their country in high regard, and
therefore are more vulnerable to exaggerated egocentric perceptions,
than their contemporaries in smaller states. It might not occur to the
lead diplomat of other counties to claim, as did Madeleine Albright,
that "if we have to use force, it is because we are America; we are the
indispensable nation. We stand tall and we see further than other
countries into the future." 98 [It is not unreasonable to suspect that
the US security community may be even more vulnerable to this
misperception than the average group of people]{.underline}. For
example, many in that community believed that the United States played a
decisive role in Vladimir Putin's decisions regarding Crimea and eastern
Ukraine. President Obama's various critics argued that perceptions of
American weakness inspired or even invited Russian aggression. The
refusal to act in Syria in particular emboldened Moscow (despite the
fact that in 2008, in the face of ample displays of US action in the
Middle East, Moscow had proven sufficiently bold to invade Georgia).
Other critics suggested that a variety of provocative US behaviors since
the end of the Cold War, especially the expansion of NATO and
dissolution of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, poisoned US--Russian
relations and led to an increase in Kremlin paranoia and eventually to
the invasion.99 So, either through provocative weakness or bullying, we
were responsible for their actions. [[Egocentric misperceptions
are]{.mark} so [ubiquitous]{.mark} and pervasive that they generate
something of a law of political psychology: we are probably less
influential in others' decision making than we think we
are]{.underline}. This extends to their decisions to resolve contentious
issues peacefully. While it may be natural for US policymakers to
interpret their role as crucial in the maintenance of world peace, it is
very likely that [Washington exaggerates its importance in the decision
making of others, and in the maintenance of international
stability.]{.underline} The effect of the ego-centric bias may be
especially difficult for the unipolar United States to resist, because
other countries do regularly take Washington's position into account
before acting. But US leaders---and the people who analyze them---should
keep in mind that [they are still probably less important to
calculations made in other capitals than they believe]{.underline}. They
may well be especially unlikely to recognize the possibility that
hegemony is epiphenomenal, that it exists alongside, but does not
affect, global stability and the New Peace. Overestimated Benevolence
After three years in the White House, Ronald Reagan had learned
something surprising: "Many people at the top of the Soviet hierarchy
were genuinely afraid of America and Americans," he wrote in his
autobiography. He continued: "Perhaps this shouldn't have surprised me,
but it did ... I'd always felt that from our deeds it must be clear to
anyone that Americans were a moral people who starting at the birth of
our nation had always used our power only as a force for good in the
world.... During my first years in Washington, I think many of us took
it for granted that the Russians, like ourselves, considered it
unthinkable that the United States would launch a first strike against
them." 100 Reagan is certainly not alone in believing in the essential
benevolent image of his nation. [While it is common for actors to
attribute negative motivations to the behavior of others, it is
exceedingly difficult for them to accept that anyone could interpret
their actions in negative ways]{.underline}. Leaders are well aware of
their own motives and tend to assume that their peaceful intentions are
obvious and transparent. Both strains of the hegemonic-stability
explanation assume not only that US power is benevolent, but that others
perceive it that way. [Hegemonic stability depends on the perceptions of
other states to be successful]{.underline}; it has no hope to succeed if
it encounters resistance from the less powerful members of the system,
or even if they simply refuse to follow the rules. Relatively small
police forces require the general cooperation of large communities to
have any chance of establishing order. [They must perceive the sheriff
as just, rational, and essentially nonthreatening.]{.underline} The lack
of balancing behavior in the system, which has been puzzling to many
realists, seems to support the notion of widespread perceptions of
benevolent hegemony.101 Were they threatened by the order constructed by
the United States, the argument goes, smaller states would react in ways
that reflected their fears. Since internal and external balancing
accompanied previous attempts to achieve hegemony, the absence of such
behavior today suggests that something is different about the US
version. Hegemonic-stability theorists purport to understand the
perceptions of others, at times better than those others understand
themselves. Complain as they may at times, other countries know that the
United States is acting in the common interest. Objections to
unipolarity, though widespread, are not "very seriously intended," wrote
Kagan, since "the truth about America's dominant role in the world is
known to most observers. And the truth is that the benevolent hegemony
exercised by the United States is good for a vast portion of the world's
population." 102 In the 1990s, Russian protests regarding NATO
expansion---though nearly universal---were not taken seriously, since US
planners believed the alliance's benevolent intentions were apparent to
all. Sagacious Russians understood that expansion would actually be
beneficial, since it would bring stability to their western border.103
President Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher were caught
off guard by the hostility of their counterparts regarding the issue at
a summit in Budapest in December 1994.104 Despite warnings from the vast
majority of academic and policy experts about the likely Russian
reaction and overall wisdom of expansion itself, the administration
failed to anticipate Moscow's position.105 [The Russians did not seem to
believe American assurances that expansion would actually be good for
them**. The United States overestimated the degree to which others saw
it as benevolent**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Once again, the culture of
the United States might make its leaders more vulnerable to this
misperception]{.underline}. The need for positive self-regard appears to
be particularly strong in North American societies compared to
elsewhere.106 Western egos tend to be gratified through self-promotion
rather than humility, and independence rather than interdependence.
Americans are more likely to feel good if they are unique rather than a
good cog in society's wheel, and uniquely good. [The need to be
perceived as benevolent, though universal, may well exert stronger
encouragement for US observers to project their perceptions onto
others.]{.underline} [The United States almost certainly frightens
others more than its leaders perceive]{.underline}. **[A quarter of the
68,000 respondents to a 2013 Gallup poll in sixty-five countries
identified the United States as the "greatest threat to world
peace]{.underline}**," which was more than three times the total for the
second-place country (Pakistan).107 [The international community always
has to worry about the potential for police brutality, even]{.underline}
if it occurs rarely. Such ungratefulness tends to come as a surprise to
US leaders. In 2003, Condoleezza Rice was dismayed to discover
resistance to US initiatives in Iraq: "There were times," she said
later, "that it appeared that American power was seen to be more
dangerous than, perhaps, Saddam Hussein." 108 [Both liberals and
neoconservatives probably exaggerate the extent to which US hegemony is
everywhere secretly welcomed]{.underline}; [it is]{.underline} not just
petulant resentment, but understandable [disagreement with US policies,
that motivates counterhegemonic beliefs and behavior.]{.underline} To
review, assuming for a moment that US leaders are subject to the same
forces that affect every human being, they overestimate the amount of
control they have over other actors, and are not as important to
decisions made elsewhere as they believe themselves to be. And they
probably perceive their own benevolence to be much greater than do
others. These common phenomena all influence US beliefs in the same
direction, and may well increase the apparent explanatory power of
hegemony beyond what the facts would otherwise support. The [United
States is probably not as central to the New Peace as either liberals or
neoconservatives believe. In]{.underline} the end, what can be said
about the relationship between US power and international stability?
Probably not much that will satisfy partisans, and the pacifying virtue
of US hegemony will remain largely an article of faith in some circles
in the policy world. Like most beliefs, it will remain immune to
alteration by logic and evidence. Beliefs rarely change, so debates
rarely end. For those not yet fully converted, however, perhaps it will
be significant that [corroborating evidence for the relationship is
extremely hard to identify]{.underline}. If indeed hegemonic stability
exists, it does so without leaving much of a trace. **[[Neither
Washington's spending,]{.mark} nor its [interventions,]{.mark} nor its
overall [grand strategy seem to matter]{.mark} much [to]{.mark} the
levels of armed [conflict]{.mark} around the world]{.underline}** (apart
from those wars that Uncle Sam starts). [The empirical record does not
contain strong reasons to believe that unipolarity and the New Peace are
related]{.underline}, and insights from [political psychology suggest
that hegemonic stability is a belief particularly susceptible to
misperception.]{.underline} US leaders probably exaggerate the degree to
which their power matters, and could retrench without much risk to
themselves or the world around them. Researchers will need to look
elsewhere to explain why the world has entered into the most peaceful
period in its history. The good news from this is that the New [Peace
will probably persist for quite some time, no matter how dominant the
United States]{.underline} is, [or what policies President Trump
follows, or how much resentment its actions cause in the
periphery]{.underline}. The people of the twenty-first century are
likely to be much safer and more secure than any of their predecessors,
even if many of them do not always believe it.

### Heg Bad - M.E. Interventionism

#### An increase of hegemony legitimizes the US to engage in middle eastern countries -- this causes a laundry list of impacts

**Shepp 18** \[Jonah Shepp 7-1-2018 Intelligencer While Condemning Iran,
the U.S. Contributes to Terrorism in the Middle East, Too
http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/08/iran-us-contribute-terrorism-middle-east.html
Accessed 11-28-2018\]

The Trump administration's concern over Iran's support for terrorist
organizations throughout the Middle East is entirely legitimate. Iran
projects regional power through a variety of non-state proxies:
Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria, Hamas in Gaza, various Shi'ite militias
in Iraq, and Yemen's Houthi rebels. All of these organizations have
engaged in terrorist activity, while the Syrian regime of Bashar
al-Assad, an Iranian client, has committed countless atrocities over
more than eight years of civil war there. Yet [[the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has]{.mark} little in the way of moral
high ground from which to berate Iran for [supporting terrorism and
destabilizing fragile states in its backyard]{.mark}. Over the past few
decades, [the U.S. has]{.mark} often found itself doing the same thing
in the course of p[rojecting our own power and defending the hegemony of
our problematic allies in the Middle East. The latest example of this
comes from Yemen]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} where an Associated
Press investigation published Monday found that [[the U.S.-backed
military]{.mark} coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates has on numerous occasions [paid off members of Al Qaeda in the
Arabian Peninsula]{.mark}]{.underline} (AQAP[) to abandon their
strongholds or even to join up with coalition forces.]{.underline} While
ostensibly at war with both AQAP and the Iran-backed Houthi rebels, the
U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia see the latter as the more pressing threat by
far. Accordingly, the AP found, [local militias supported by the
coalition frequently recruit seasoned Al Qaeda fighters into their ranks
to fight the Houthis, in deals allegedly brokered by Emirati agents and
greased with Saudi money. The U.S. does not directly fund the coalition,
and the investigation found no evidence of American money making its way
to AQAP militants. Nonetheless, [the U.S. has supported the coalition
with billions of dollars in weaponry, while providing intelligence and
air support, chiefly in the form of drone strikes]{.mark}. Money is
fungible, and every dollar the U.S. spends on weapons for the coalition
is a dollar Saudi Arabia or the U.A.E. saves to spend on bribing or
recruiting AQAP jihadists. When our drones hold off on bombing AQAP
convoys while the coalition grants them safe passage into their mountain
hideaways, we are still complicit in a dirty deal.]{.underline} This
doesn't make us any worse than Iran, but it underscores the reality that
in messy wars over failed states, nobody comes out with clean hands. Not
one participant in the humanitarian catastrophe that is the Yemeni civil
war has in mind the best interests of Yemen as a country or the Yemeni
people. As the regional powers play their grand strategy game and
attempt to muscle the country into their respective spheres of
influence, everyone on the ground is just scrambling to survive and to
expand their piece of a very small pie. The attitude of local militia
commanders was described to the AP thusly: "[We will unite with the
devil in the face of Houthis." In this context, the notion that we could
intervene in Yemen and not end up doing business with people who ought
to be our enemies is almost ridiculous]{.underline}. [The same is true
of Syria, where [the U.S. has consistently had a hell of a time sorting
out the "good" rebel factions we can conscientiously support from the
jihadists we'd rather not.]{.mark} Despite our best efforts to only arm
the good guys, some of the weapons we dumped into Syria inevitably fell
into the hands of radical terror groups, including ISIS.]{.underline} In
Iraq, too, militias once supported by Iran have become partners of the
U.S. in our efforts to help that country beat back ISIS and restore some
vestige of stability. Alliances with paramilitary groups were also a key
component of the U.S. counterinsurgency operations during the most
violent years of our occupation of Iraq. Needless to say, that
occupation was itself among the most destabilizing events to befall the
Middle East in its modern history and has led to tens of thousands of
deaths from terrorism. [It's hard for the [U.S.]{.mark} to credibly
condemn Iran for [supporting terrorism when every time we involve
ourselves in a Middle Eastern conflict, we find ourselves contributing
--- directly or indirectly]{.mark}, [wittingly or unwittingly --- to
instability, violence, and yes, terrorism]{.mark}. The means of our
foreign policy in the Middle East are at odds with its supposed ends.
Our invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, our attempts to tip the scales of
the conflicts in Libya and Syria, and our intervention in Yemen have
only exacerbated the region's ills. [Our close relationship with Saudi
Arabia, which easily rivals Iran as an inspiration, sponsor, and
financier of terrorism, is a big part of the problem. By supporting
Saudi hegemony in the greater Middle East, we have abetted the
proliferation of a radical Islamist ideology no less toxic than that of
the Iranian mullahs]{.mark}. Moreover, by keeping Iran in a constant
state of threat, we justify its leaders' paranoia and motivate them to
counter the Saudis with weapons proliferation and terrorist activities
of their own]{.underline}

### AT Transition Wars

#### Hegemonic decline will be peaceful

Christopher, \"Unipolarity, Hegemony, and the New Peace,\" Security
Studies, 26:3, 423-451, DOI: 10.1080/09636412.2017.1306394

**[Why has armed conflict declined to historically low
levels]{.underline}**? What accounts for the post-Cold War peace, and
how long is it likely to last? Surely no questions are more important
for either the theory or practice of international relations, and few
are harder to answer. Only by understanding the causes of the New Peace
can we extrapolate its likely future, however, and plan accordingly. Of
the many possible independent variables, **[none is more controversial
than the suggestion that hegemonic stability is at work. The possibility
that the United States]{.underline}**, wittingly or not, **[has
essentially established a global Pax Americana is generally overlooked
by the major scholarly works on the subject]{.underline}**. This stands
in stark contrast to the policy world, where the **[many [positive
aspects of unipolarity]{.mark} and/or US hegemony [are articles of
faith, rarely discussed and never seriously
questione]{.mark}d]{.underline}**. Scholar and public intellectual
Michael Lind spoke for many when he wrote, "in my experience, most
members of the U.S. foreign policy elite sincerely believe that the
alternative to perpetual U.S. world domination is chaos and war." 4 One
of those is certainly Robert Kagan, who noted, "Pinker traces the
beginning of a long-term decline in deaths from war to 1945, which just
happens to be birthdate of the American world order. The coincidence
eludes him, but it need not elude us."5

This paper examines the theoretical, empirical, and psychological
foundations of that widespread belief. The first section discusses the
New Peace and its potential explanations; the second explains the
difference between unipolarity and hegemony, and examines the logic of
the hegemonic-stability argument; the third turns to the evidence,
comparing both US power and grand strategy to conflict levels; the
fourth examines the political psychology of hegemony and reviews some
major findings that provide insight into how international order can be
misperceived. Insights from that field are crucial in any discussion of
the relationship between US power and global stability, which is built
far more on belief and perception than evidence.

**[The [New Peace]{.mark} does [not]{.mark} appear to be the [result of
unipolarity]{.mark} or US hegemony]{.underline}**. **[While that
conclusion might not sit well with many US analysts, the news is not all
bad, for if the current generation of declinists is right and
unipolarity's days are numbered, [the odds are good that the world will
not descend into the atavistic chaos that haunts the neoconservative
imagination.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[The United States can adjust its
grand strategy]{.mark} without fear in the Trump years, perhaps even
[letting the "unipolar moment" expire]{.mark},]{.underline}** because
the New Peace may well be unrelated to its dominance.6

## AT Prolif

### No Prolif

#### No risk of proliferation -- use of weapons has been highly exaggerated and attacks aren't executed

**Mueller 18** (John, Adjunct Professor of Political Science and Woody
Hayes Senior Research Scientist at Ohio State University and a Senior
Fellow at the Cato Institute. He is the author of Atomic Obsession:

Matter", Foreign Affairs, Nov-Dec
2018, https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2018-10-15/nuclear-weapons-dont-matter)

[Since the 1940s, [nuclear weapons]{.mark} have greatly affected defense
budgets, political and military posturing, and academic
theory]{.underline}. Beyond that, however, [their practical
[significance]{.mark} [has been vastly
exaggerated]{.mark}]{.underline} by both critics and
supporters. [[Nuclear weapons]{.mark} were not necessary to deter a
third world war]{.underline}. They [have proved useless
militarily]{.underline}; in fact, [their primary use has been to [stoke
the national ego]{.mark}]{.underline} [or to posture
against]{.underline} real or imagined[threats]{.underline}. [[Few states
have or want them]{.mark}, and they seem to be out of reach for
terrorists]{.underline}. [Their [impact]{.mark}]{.underline} on
international affairs [[has been minor]{.underline}]{.mark} compared
with the sums and words expended on them. [The
costs]{.underline} resulting from the nuclear weapons obsession[have
been huge]{.underline}. To hold its own in a snarling contest with the
Soviet Union during the Cold War, [the United States spent \$5--\$10
trillion maintaining a vast nuclear arsenal]{.underline}---resources
that could have been used more productively on almost anything else. To
head off the imagined dangers that would result from nuclear
proliferation, [[Washington and its allies have
imposed]{.underline}]{.mark} devastating
economic [[sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark} on countries such as Iraq and
North Korea, [and]{.underline} even [launched a war of
aggression]{.underline}---sorry, "preemption"---[that killed more people
than]{.underline} did the nuclear bombs dropped on [Hiroshima and
Nagasaki]{.underline}. The time has long since come to acknowledge that
the [[thinkers of the early nuclear age]{.mark} were mistaken in
believing that the world had been made anew]{.underline}. In
retrospect, [they [overestimated the importance of the nuclear
revolution and the delicacy of the balance of
terror]{.mark}]{.underline}. This spurred generations of officials to
worry more about nuclear matters than they should have and to distort
foreign and security policies in unfortunate ways. Today's policymakers
don't have to repeat the same mistakes, and everybody would be better
off if they didn't. Over the decades, [[the atomic obsession]{.mark} has
taken various forms, [focus]{.mark}ing [on]{.mark}]{.underline} an
endless array of [[worst-case scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark}: [bolts
from the blue, accidental wars, lost arms races, proliferation spirals,
nuclear terrorism]{.underline}. The common feature among all these
disasters is that [[none of them has ever
materialized]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Either we are the luckiest people in
history or the [risks have been overstated]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### No prolif risk due to NPT resiliency

**Egeland 18** (Kjølv, DPhil in International Relations, is a fellow of
the Norwegian Academy of International Law. His research explores the
evolution of the nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime.,
"Kill the NPT Collapse Thesis", European Leadership Network,
7-20-2018, https://www.europeanleadershipnetwork.org/commentary/kill-the-npt-collapse-thesis/)

[A number of analysts have in recent months contended that the NPT
process is at risk of "crumbling" or is damaged "beyond
repair".]{.underline} But the fear-mongering is unfounded. In fact, the
impending doom of the NPT has been prophesized again and again since the
1960s. However, [not only is the [NPT "collapse thesis" wrong, it
is detrimental to the goals of non-proliferation]{.mark} and
disarmament]{.underline}. The narrative that the NPT is endlessly on the
verge of disintegration fuels the thinking that nuclear restraint is a
painful sacrifice and implicitly calls on the NPT community to protect
the status quo rather than to push for the advancement of the Treaty's
goals. The triumph of non-proliferation In the 1960s, several
governments viewed the NPT with intense hostility. The German Cabinet
Minister Franz-Josef Strauß branded the NPT a "Versailles of cosmic
dimensions". As late as 1978, the Chinese government described the
Treaty as "a conspiracy concocted by the USSR and the U.S. to maintain
their nuclear monopoly." But over time, as the superpowers twisted their
allies' arms and the non-proliferation norm took hold, opposition to the
Treaty waned. NPT sceptics such as Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile,
China, France, Germany, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland,
and Thailand all eventually joined. As of today, [only five UN member
states are not party to the NPT]{.underline}. Only a single state, North
Korea, has withdrawn. [[Four of]{.mark} the [NPT's non-nuclear-weapon
states parties have renounced nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}(South
Africa, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan), and many more have reversed
nuclear-weapon programmes. The poverty of the NPT collapse thesis It is
striking, however, that the remarkable period of non-proliferation norm
consolidation from the mid-1960s till today has produced a ceaseless
flood of expert assertions that the NPT is about to
collapse. [Proponents of the collapse thesis commonly argue that a
continued reluctance]{.underline} by the nuclear-weapon states [to move
more decisively towards disarmament will push non-nuclear weapon states
to "go nuclear" or defect from the NPT.]{.underline} [In other cases,
collapse theorists argue that proliferation by one
state]{.underline} (India, North Korea, Iran...) [will lead to a chain
reaction]{.underline} whereby numerous other states will defect from the
NPT and construct their own nuclear armouries. The collapse thesis is
often invoked in support of abolition. If the alternative to disarmament
is NPT collapse and ensuing global pandemonium, so goes the argument,
the nuclear-armed states might prefer to reduce and eliminate their
nuclear arsenals. But [the [use of the collapse thesis]{.mark} as an
argument for disarmament [is]{.mark} in fact deeply counterproductive,
let alone [inaccurate]{.mark}]{.underline}. Based on the assumption that
a large group of non-nuclear states are perpetually looking for reasons
to arm themselves with weapons of mass destruction -- implicitly
representing nuclear restraint as a surrender of something positive --
the collapse thesis upholds the trope that denuclearization is a
struggle against nature. It supports the argument that meaningful
disarmament measures can only be pursued once "those without nuclear
weapons \[...\] feel no need to acquire them". [One
version]{.underline} of the collapse thesis [states that the NPT
will]{.underline}, or could [be, seriously damaged by a failure by its
parties]{.underline} to reach a negotiated final document at two review
conferences in a row. [But [the NPT has not]{.mark} only [survived such
"failures", it has thrived]{.mark} and increased its
membership]{.underline}. In fact, the sixth NPT Review Conference, in
2000, was the first such conference to reach consensus on a fully
negotiated final document. The CTBT, START, and New START were
negotiated on the back of the "failed" conferences in 1990 and 2005.

#### Trump [reduces]{.underline} the likelihood of nuclear proliferation

**Muller & Pastore 17** (James, MD and cardiologist in Boston working at
the Brigham and Women's Hospital, a major affiliate of the Harvard
Medical School, worked with the International Physicians for Prevention
of Nuclear War (IPPNW), which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, John,
MD and cardiologist in Boston and a Professor of Medicine at Tufts
University School of Medicine, former Lieutenant Commander in the U.S.
Public Health Service and a Research Internist with the Atomic Bomb
Casualty Commission in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, IPPNW's former Executive
Secretary, has focused on the moral and ethical argument for the
elimination of nuclear weapons, "Two Nobel Prize-winning nuclear experts

Yet as unlikely as it may seem, [Donald [Trump]{.mark}]{.underline}, the
very man who has reinstalled this base fear,[could]{.underline} also [be
[the very person to lead the world toward nuclear
disarmament]{.mark}]{.underline}. The fact that a leader as
inexperienced as Trump has access to nuclear launch codes that could
destroy whole nations instantaneously has publicly reignited the issue
of nuclear proliferation. However, [the fundamental problem
is]{.underline} not [that]{.underline} Trump has access to [the nuclear
codes]{.underline}---it's that they [exist in the first
place.]{.underline} Getting people to sit up and recognize that [there
is an unacceptable level of nuclear threat]{.underline} is an essential
step to global nuclear disarmament; governments will not budge without
public support. [If anything, [Trump's presidency has re-alerted the
world to]{.mark} the notion of [nuclear annihilation]{.mark} and [led to
an awakening in]{.mark} social [activism]{.mark} in younger
generations]{.underline}. Many interpreted this as a call to expand
nuclear weaponry, perhaps in response to Russian president Vladimir
Putin's statement earlier in the day that Russia needed to "strengthen
the military potential of strategic nuclear forces." A Trump
spokesperson later said that "[strengthen" referred to the need to work
against proliferation to rogue nations]{.underline}. But was that truly
his intention? After all, he also supposedly remarked, "Let it be an
arms race. We will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all," to
MSNBC co-host Mika Brzezinski when asked about the tweet. This is
comment is similar to those made by president Reagan early in his
presidency, before he changed his tune toward abolition. [If [Trump
is]{.mark} truly in favor of nuclear disarmament, he may be [the
best-positioned world leader]{.mark} in recent history [to move this
effort forward]{.mark}. The [fear he has incited has]{.mark} had the
unintended byproduct of [increas]{.mark}ing public [awareness]{.mark}
[of this topic]{.mark}]{.underline} for the first time in decades. Then
there are his close connections with Russia: He places a high priority
on improving relations with the other country most deeply embroiled in
the problem, and the selection of Rex Tillerson as secretary of state
adds the strength of an individual experienced in working with Russia.
He has also met with former secretary of state Henry Kissinger, who has
recommended "Russia should be perceived as an essential element of any
new global equilibrium, not primarily as a threat to the United States."
Add to this the fact that the Democrats likewise do not wish for Trump
to be anywhere near "the big red button," so proposals he puts forward
in Congress toward nuclear abolition should be met with some degree of
bi-partisan support. [Oddly enough, [nuclear non-proliferation might be
about to have its moment.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### No Impact

#### There's no impact to proliferation -- alarmists are wrong

**Mueller 17** (John, Professor of Political Science and Senior Research
Scientist at the Mershon Center for International Security Studies and
Senior Fellow at CATO Institute, "Cato Handbook for Policymakers -- 76.

Except for their effects on agonies, obsessions, rhetoric, posturing,
and spending, [the [consequences of nuclear proliferation have
been]{.mark} largely [benign]{.mark}: those who have acquired the
weapons have "used" them]{.underline} simply [to stoke their egos or to
deter]{.underline} real or imagined [threats]{.underline}. For the most
part, [[nuclear powers have found]{.mark} the [weapons]{.mark} to be
[a]{.mark}]{.underline} notable [[waste of time]{.underline}]{.mark},
money, effort, and scientific talent. They have
quietly [kept]{.underline} the weapons [in storage]{.underline} and
haven't even found much benefit in rattling them from time to time. If
the recent efforts to keep Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons have been
successful, those efforts have done Iran a favor. [[There has never been
a militarily compelling reason to use nuclear
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly because [it has not been
possible to identify suitable targets]{.underline}---or targets that
couldn't be attacked as effectively by conventional munitions.
Conceivably, conditions exist under which nuclear weapons could serve a
deterrent function, but there is little reason to suspect that they have
been necessary to deter war thus far, even during the Cold War. The main
Cold War contestants have never believed that a repetition of World War
II, whether embellished by nuclear weapons or not, is remotely in their
interests. Moreover, the weapons have not proved to be crucial status
symbols. How much more status would Japan have if it possessed nuclear
weapons? Would anybody pay a great deal more attention to Britain or
France if their arsenals held 5,000 nuclear weapons, or much less if
they had none? Did China need nuclear weapons to impress the world with
its economic growth or its Olympics? [Those considerations help explain
why [alarmists have been wrong for decades about the pace of nuclear
proliferation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Most famously, in the 1960s,
President John Kennedy anticipated that in another decade "fifteen or
twenty or twenty-five nations may have these weapons." Yet, [[of the
dozens of technologically capable countries that have considered
obtaining nuclear arsenals, very few have done
so]{.mark}.]{.underline} Insofar as most leaders of most countries (even
rogue ones) have considered acquiring the weapons, they have come to
appreciate several drawbacks of doing so: nuclear weapons are dangerous,
costly, and likely to rile the neighbors. Moreover, as the University of
Southern California's Jacques Hymans has demonstrated, [the weapons have
also been exceedingly difficult for administratively dysfunctional
countries to obtain]{.underline}---it took decades for North Korea and
Pakistan to do so. In consequence, [alarmist
[predictions]{.mark}]{.underline} about proliferation chains, cascades,
dominoes, waves, avalanches, epidemics, and points of no return [[have
proved faulty]{.mark}. ]{.underline}Although proliferation has so far
had little consequence, that is not because the only countries to get
nuclear weapons have had rational leaders. Large, important countries
that acquired the bomb were run at the time by unchallenged---perhaps
certifiably deranged---monsters. Consider Joseph Stalin, who, in 1949,
was planning to change the climate of the Soviet Union by planting a lot
of trees, and Mao Zedong, who, in 1964, had just carried out a bizarre
social experiment that resulted in an artificial famine in which tens of
millions of Chinese perished. Some also fear that a country might use
its nuclear weapons to "dominate" its area. That argument was used with
dramatic urgency before 2003 when Saddam Hussein supposedly posed great
danger, and it has been frequently applied to Iran. Exactly how that
domination is to be carried out is never made clear. The notion,
apparently, is this: should an atomic rogue state rattle the occasional
rocket, other countries in the area, suitably intimidated, would bow to
its demands. [Far more likely, threatened states would make common cause
with each other and with other concerned
countries ]{.underline}(including nuclear ones) against the threatening
neighbor. That is how countries coalesced into an alliance of
convenience to oppose Iraq's region-threatening invasion of Kuwait in
1990. Yet another [concern has been that the weapons will go off, by
accident or miscalculation,]{.underline}devastating the planet in the
process: the weapons exist in the thousands, sooner or later one or more
of them will inevitably go off. [But those [prognostications
have]{.mark} now [failed to deliver for 70 years]{.mark}]{.underline}.
That time period suggests [[something more than luck is
operating]{.underline}]{.mark}. Moreover, the notion that if one nuclear
weapon goes off in one place, the world will necessarily be plunged into
thermonuclear cataclysm should remain in the domain of Hollywood
scriptwriters.

[strikingly

to those that took place in Baltimore]{.underline}** in 2015, where the
downtown entertainment district was also the site of clashes between
protesters and patrons, and in Ferguson in 2014, where retail stores
were a frequent target of riots.

Keith Lamont Scott was shot in a predominately African-American
neighborhood in Northeast Charlotte. But the protests that followed his
death moved from that community into a majority-white area, culminating
in the blockading of Highway I-85 on Tuesday night. On Wednesday, nearly
all of these sites of protests were in the downtown area's upscale
entertainment districts. (Scroll over the map below to see racial
breakdowns by Census tract.)

Martin Luther King Jr. said that "riots do not develop out of thin air."
Keith Lamont Scott's death caused grievances long-simmering under the
surface of Charlotte to boil over. Charlotte, despite its status as a
financial powerhouse in North Carolina, is intensely segregated,
demographically and economically. As shown in the map below, the city's
wealth is concentrated on the majority-white south side, and its poverty
is disproportionately spread across the majority-black north and west
sides. Scroll over the Census tracts to see the percentage of residents
living below the poverty line per Census tract. (Note: some population
points from the outer areas of the county were not available in the
Census' data sets.)

As of 2014, 70 of Charlotte's 79 high-poverty tracts were majority
non-white, according to Gene Nichol, a Professor of Law at UNC Chapel
Hill. And while 70 percent of black households there earn lessthan
\$60,000 a year, nearly 60 percent of white households make more. The
median income for white families is 86 percent higher than for black and
Hispanic ones.

Louis Hyman, an associate professor of history at Cornell University,
argues **[[we can]{.mark}no[t]{.mark} [understand the]{.mark} protests
and sporadic [riots and looting]{.mark} that have occurred over the past
two days [without looking at the]{.mark} intense [geographic]{.mark} and
economic [segregation]{.mark} in which they took place]{.underline}**.
From Ferguson to Baltimore to Charlotte, **[rioting]{.underline}**,
Hyman notes, **[often breaks out in poor, black neighborhoods---where
people feel both oppressed by police and by the [predatory lenders and
overpriced
stores](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/crime/2015/05/baltimore_riots_it_wasn_t_thugs_looting_for_profit_it_was_a_protest_against.html)
in their communities.]{.underline}** Hyman explored this idea in a
conversation with CityLab:

Ferguson, Baltimore, and now Charlotte: We sometimes see that local
protests in response to police killings morph into riots. Why do you
think this is?

**[[Riots]{.underline}]{.mark}**, though they do occur, **[[are]{.mark}
relatively [rare]{.mark}]{.underline}**. More frequent are peaceful
protests and community meetings, but these of course don't get the same
coverage. Riots occur because these police killings just keep happening,
no matter how many peaceful marches happen. It is, in every sense,
maddening. **[[Many]{.mark} have tried to [discredit the riots by
pointing to the occasional looting that has occurred, claiming]{.mark}
such [actions by protestors are destructive to \"their own
communities]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}** In Ferguson, a QT gas station
became an iconic site of destruction during the protests. In Baltimore,
it was a CVS and the payday lender ACE Cash Express. In Charlotte on
Tuesday, it was a Walmart. What drives the animus against these
institutions, which often seem to be large corporate chains, and why are
they the secondary targets of anti-police brutality protests?

For poor black people in cities, the surveillance that they experience
at stores and on the streets are of a piece. When they walk in a store
they are watched. When they leave the store, their receipts are
questioned. They might be ripped off, or not, but they are made to feel
less like sovereign customers and more like suspects. Unwarranted police
stops feel similar. Those who are watched feel disrespected, and
constantly reminded that they are not in charge. Riots provide that
sense of control, but at a terrible cost.

Middle-class white people rarely have these experiences, so it is hard
for them to understand what Walmart and police could have in common.

You have written that \"riots reflect fury not just at the police, but
at the constraints of the ghetto's retail economy, where the poor pay
more.\" How do police uphold this "ghetto retail economy," where the
poor are deprived of the competitive market pricing present in
better-off suburbs?

In places where there are few legitimate jobs, the underground economy
makes up the difference. Payday lenders and pawn brokers are the tip of
an illicit iceberg, of which the drug trade is a major part. Fighting
this illegal economy has resulted in police becoming an occupying force.
Policing an economy with a handgun, needless to say, is an impossible
task. Are there historical cases in which riots have been an effective
tactic for police brutality reform?

**[Riots draw attention to these issues in a way that protests and
op-eds do not]{.underline}**. It is hard to say that riots lead to
reform, but without the riots, these kinds of activities would easily
slip forgotten into the news cycle. In that sense, they are effective.
But **[[too much rioting, and the goodwill of Americans will
ebb]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

In the 1960s, mobile television cameras made police brutality real on
the evening news, and gave the civil rights protesters legitimacy. But
as the riots wore on through the '60s, that legitimacy turned into fear.

Smartphones and dash-cam documentation of police violence could have the
same effect, but not if images of the riots drown them out. It is an
unfortunate truth that some white Americans are more frightened by a
store burning than a policeman killing.

Is there something about the economic environments of the poor
segregated black sections of Baltimore, Ferguson, and now Charlotte that
may have made riots in response to police killings there more likely in
a way that larger cities have not, like Chicago, New York, and Los
Angeles?

Yes. Larger cities have faster-growing, more diversified economies. Poor
people in second-tier cities---and rural people everywhere---are being
left out of the digitally driven urban economy that is keeping our GDP
numbers (and stock tickers) so positive. Like New York, Charlotte's main
industry is finance. But unlike New York, for those left out of finance,
Charlotte can look like any other de-industrialized town. In New York
(or Chicago or Los Angeles), there are other sectors in which to work.
The best solution to these issues would be to provide job opportunities
for the urban poor and to de-escalate the failed drug war. Until police
can be police, and not occupiers, there will be no end to these
tragedies.

Looking at what has happened in Baltimore since the riots over the
police-involved death of Freddie Gray, what can the people of Charlotte
expect in the coming months?

They can expect a justice system that will not find any one individual
in a position of power responsible. **[No police officers were found
guilty in Gray's death, and on some level, that is true. It is not a
failure of individuals but a failure of the system.]{.underline}** I
would urge Charlotteans not to put too much faith in holding someone
accountable, but have a broader conversation about what can be done,
systemically, to prevent this \[police violence\] from continuing to
happen. As long as police experience themselves as a militarized,
occupying force, these kinds of abuses will continue.

#### Riots fail -- they're tactically counterproductive

**Pinker 12** \[Steven Pinker is a Johnstone Family Professor in the
Department of Psychology at Harvard University. He conducts research on
language and cognition, writes for publications such as the New York
Times, Time and The Atlantic. JULY/AUGUST 2012 ISSUE, \"Violence Doesn't
Work (Most of the Time),\" Atlantic, accessed 7-26-2019,
https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/07/violence-doesn-t-work-most-of-the-time/309031/\]

**[[People have]{.mark} long [assumed that violence is necessary for
political change]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Rulers never cede power
voluntarily, the argument goes, so **[progressives have no choice but to
contemplate the use of force to bring about a better
world,]{.underline}** mindful of the trade-off between a small amount of
violence now and acceptance of an unjust status quo indefinitely.
**[[Terrorists invoke this trade-off to justify what would otherwise
be]{.mark} wanton [murder]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Even their most
vociferous condemners concede that terrorism, though highly immoral, is
often efficacious.

Of course, **[Mohandas [Gandhi, and]{.mark} later [M]{.mark}artin
[L]{.mark}uther [K]{.mark}ing Jr., [argued]{.mark} the opposite---[that
violence]{.mark}, in addition to being morally heinous, [is tactically
counterproductive]{.mark}. Violent movements attract thugs and
firebrands who enjoy the mayhem]{.underline}**. Violent tactics provide
a pretext for retaliation by the enemy and alienate third parties who
might otherwise support the movement.

So how effective is violence? Political scientists have recently tried
tallying the successes and failures of violent and nonviolent movements.
The evidence is piling up that **[[Gandhi was right]{.mark}---at least
on average. In separate analyses, Audrey Cronin and Max Abrahms have
shown that [terrorist movements almost always fizzle out without
achieving any of their strategic aims]{.mark}. Just [think of the failed
independence movements in Puerto Rico, Ulster, Quebec, Basque Country,
Kurdistan, and Tamil Eelam. The success rate of terrorist movements is,
at best, in the single digits.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

In their recent book, Why Civil Resistance Works, Erica Chenoweth and
Maria Stephan found that **[[about three-quarters of nonviolent
movements get]{.mark} some or all of [what they want, compared with only
about a third of the violent ones]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} The
Arab Spring bears this out: consider the more or less nonviolent
movements that ousted the leaders of Egypt, Tunisia, and Yemen (together
with the violent one needed in Libya). Even more encouraging, the
success rate of nonviolent protest movements has steadily climbed since
the 1940s, while that of violent movements has fallen since the 1980s.

## AT Sanctions

### Sanctions Bad - U.S. Cred

#### Sanctions are actively hurting the U.S. , no sanctions would be better for US legitimacy 

**Bandow 18\'** (Doug, september 20, 2018,Doug Bandow is a senior fellow
at the Cato Institute. A former special assistant to President Ronald
Reagan, he is author of Foreign Follies: America's New Global Empire.
\"Washington's Endless Sanctions Are Finally Backfiring\"
https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/washingtons-endless-sanctions-are-finally-backfiring/https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/washingtons-endless-sanctions-are-finally-backfiring/

[This arrogance has driven the [Trump administration's misguided policy
toward Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}. After his visit to Riyadh last
year---the first trip of his presidency---Trump appeared to be taking
orders from the Saudis. He [[abandoned the nuclear
deal,]{.underline}]{.mark} which created the most intrusive nuclear
inspection regime ever, and demanded that Tehran drop its independent
foreign policy, [handing Riyadh regional dominance. [Washington insisted
that it would deploy America's full power against any
nation]{.mark}]{.underline}, friend or foe, that continued to trade with
Iran. "Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with
the United States," tweeted the president. After seeking to prevent the
Europeans from following an independent foreign policy, Washington
sought to coerce them to back its irresponsible course. Now it blames
their refusal to do so on former Obama officials like John Kerry rather
than the administration's own irresponsible arrogance.

Washington has encountered unusual resistance. [American [economic
strength gives unique advantages vis-à-vis other governments]{.mark},
[but]{.mark} their [acquiescence to the U.S. is also critical]{.mark}.
And r[esistance]{.mark} may be [growing]{.mark}. For instance[, China
and India appear likely to continue]{.mark} at least some [commercial
dealings with Iran]{.mark}, challenging the U.S.]{.underline}

More significantly, the [Europeans are considering]{.underline} a number
of [strategies]{.underline}, including using the European Investment
Bank and/or their central banks to [handle financial transactions with
Iran.]{.underline} That would dare Washington to initiate economic war
against them---barring their firms from complying with American
sanctions, establishing an alternative to the [SWIFT global financial
messaging network, and creating a "special purpose" financial company to
process payments for deals with Iran.]{.underline} The latter would
establish a de facto accounting firm to handle money both ways, keeping
the cash within the EU and avoiding reliance on banks vulnerable to U.S.
sanctions. Germany's finance ministry reported ongoing negotiations:
"[The Ge[rman government is working together with \[European agencies
and countries\] on maintaining financial payment channels with
Iran]{.mark}."]{.underline} France is even considering using state-owned
firms to trade with Iran.

[Just as misguided U.S. policy toward Moscow pushed Russia and China
together, reversing Richard Nixon's famous strategy, pervasive American
sanctions now are pushing the Europeans towards China and
Russia.]{.underline}

And while [[European governments were not willing to greatly bestir
themselves over Washington's attempts to isolate]{.underline},
say]{.mark}, Cuba and Sudan, Iran is different. [America [abandoned an
international agreement]{.mark}, dismissed European
interests]{.underline}, disrupted burgeoning commerce, [[further
destabilized the Middle East, and demanded humiliating
obedience]{.mark}.]{.underline} Europeans, used to giving in, now are
angrier and less willing to accept the Trump administration's fait
accompli. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire opined: "I want Europe
to be a sovereign continent, not a vassal, and that means having totally
independent financing instruments that do not today exist."

### AT Russia Sanctions - Don't Work

#### Sanctions against Russia are no longer effective, if anything it backfires

**Closson 19\'** ( January 1, 2019, Stacy Closson is a Global Fellow at
Kennan and Senior Adjunct Professional Lecturer at American University's
School of International Service. \... She came to Patterson from the
Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars in Washington, D.C.
where she was a Kennan fellow.\"Diminishing Returns: How Effective Are
Sanctions Against
Russia?\"www.ponarseurasia.org/memo/diminishing-returns-how-effective-are-sanctions-against-russia

Signs of Diminishing Returns

In [the [case of the United States and Russia, sanctions]{.mark} regimes
are overlapping and this is [undermining their
strength]{.mark}]{.underline}. [For example, [targeting Russian
billionaire]{.mark} Oleg Deripaska's Rusal aluminum business
[backfired]{.mark} when the price of aluminum skyrocketed]{.underline},
threatening a potential global shortage[. The [Trump administration is
now backtracking]{.mark},]{.underline} preparing [to remove financial
restrictions on Rusal and two other Deripaska-linked
companies.]{.underline} The previously mentioned DAKSAA and DETER bills
under consideration in the Senate hit companies involved in the
Nordstream II pipeline from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea. This
could alienate France and Germany, who are critical to overall sanctions
success. [It [could also harm U.S. companies with ties to the European
energy interests, which are numerous and diverse.]{.mark}]{.underline}

If the [point of sanctions is to punish the Russian government, the
evidence is mixed]{.underline}. The [sanctions will make more enemies
than friends, something that is difficult to recover, as the United
States discovered in Iraq]{.underline}. Surveys suggestthat Russians
still very much support their government's actions in Crimea. The smart
sanctions targeting oligarchs combined with a lack of foreign finance
for their businesses has allowed the Russian government to consolidate
even more assets. Indeed, strong leaders like Vladimir Putin who have
little political dissent and can manipulate elite politics are more
likely to retain their position[. [At the same time, sanctions seem to
be gradually]{.underline} straining [the oligarchs' relationship with
the security services and with the president.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Putin may be learning the wrong lessons in sanctions effectiveness.
After the collapse of the USSR, Russia used a series of sanctions
against former Soviet states to extract concessions, but by mid-2000,
their impact was negligible]{.underline}]{.mark}. Now, learning from the
sanctions against it since 2014, Russia is sanctioning over 300
Ukrainian business leaders and almost 70 businesses[. Not only that, but
Russia's latest detention of Ukrainian ships and sailors in the Sea of
Azov preceded by Russian backed elections in the two separatist regions
of eastern Ukraine in violation of Minsk II signal that Putin is not
deterred by the sanctions that exist,]{.underline} nor the potential for
more.

[Going after Russia's energy sector could also backfire. Forbidding U.S.
companies from operating in regions where Russian banks and energy
companies are involved hampers the U.S. ability to compete.]{.underline}
Already, the absence of Western firms has increased the importance of
Chinese investment in Russia's energy projects, particularly in the
Arctic, albeit at the expense of Russia ceding a percentage of ownership
of its firms. A second round of U[.S. sanctions to be]{.underline}
determined [this February 2019 under the 1991 Chemical and Biological
Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act in response to the Russian
poisoning of the Skripals i]{.underline}n Britain may restrict all
Russian products into the United States, including the 5 percent of
Russian crude imported from Russia. However, Russia is already
redirecting oil to China from Europe, and this would only further
regionalize oil trade, which is not good in terms of maintaining a
moderated global price.

There are also efforts by companies and countries globally to avert
sanctions on Russia. Western creditors by fall 2016 were adjusting
cooperation to avoid those Russians directly targeted and look for other
ventures. There are further reports that European companies were finding
alternative ways to place orders from Russian companies or exporting
items to Russia through partners or subsidiaries in third countries[.
The U.S. Congress added a waiver to CAATSA to prevent sanctions on
countries, such as India, who are reliant on defense equipment from
Russia.]{.underline}

[Finally, [the negative impact on Russia's economy from sanctions
appears to have hit a wall]{.mark}. Up to 2017, most
experts]{.underline} agreed [sanctions were harming the Russian economy.
I]{.underline}ndeed, the overall trend since 2014 is one in which the
Russian economy is not growing as expected, but this is also viewed by
experts as the result of a poor Russian domestic business climate (e.g.,
attracting investors, stalled technology sector) and lower oil prices.
Instead, there are some signs since 2017 that Russia is recovering,
albeit modestly, due to stronger global growth and rising oil prices.
[Moscow's foreign currency reserves are at an all-time high and a
dramatic reduction in capital flight has freed up dollars for social
programs.]{.underline}

## AT Ukraine Civil War

### Non-UQ

#### The Ukraine civil war has been going on since 2014

**Twickel 19** (Nikolaus von Twickel -- A Berlin-based writer focusing
on the war in Donbass, "The State of Play in the Donbass",
https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/03/11/the-state-of-play-in-the-donbass-a64764)

The [Donbass]{.underline} region [of eastern [Ukraine
is]{.mark}]{.underline} among [[Europe's most
deadly]{.underline}]{.mark} modern [[battlefields]{.mark} on which more
than 13,000 people have been killed [since 2014]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Tragically, the suffering people of Donbass happen to live at the wrong
place at the wrong time. While the overall death toll is shocking, the
broad European public has become comfortably numb about it, as people
are dying in much smaller numbers than in 2014 and 2015. Last year, the
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) recorded 43
civilian deaths -- half as many as in 2017. While military violence is
almost always an unnecessary evil, this one is particularly bizarre in
that it occurs with little or no military value. Since the signing of
the Minsk Package of Measures in February 2015 ("Minsk II"), both sides
have barely moved an inch over the "Contact Line" agreed with French and
German help in the Belarusian capital. Instead[, [Eastern Ukraine has
become]{.underline} [a]{.underline}]{.mark}[n information]{.underline}
[[warfare battleground. The shootings]{.mark} and killings [serve a
political purpose]{.mark} -- the sides want to keep the status quo in
order to avoid the agreement's unsavoury political parts.]{.underline}
[They may also want to send a signal to the outside world that [they are
under attack]{.mark} and convince their domestic audience to put up with
wartime constraints.]{.underline} As the military dimension has receded,
the clash of narratives has grown disproportionately. Ukraine is eager
to tell the world that it is fighting Russia, who has attacked, invaded
and occupied parts of the country since the annexation of Crimea in
2014. **[For Russia and its proxies in Donbass, [a civil war in eastern
Ukraine is happening]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### Shelling and skirmishes still happen regularly in the Ukraine civil war

**CFR 19** (Global Conflict Tracker -- the Council on Foreign Relations,
a nonpartisan foreign policy think tank, "Conflict in Ukraine",
https://www.cfr.org/interactive/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/conflict-ukraine)

[**The conflict in eastern Ukraine has transitioned to a stalemate after
it first erupted in early 2014, but** [shelling and skirmishes still
occur regularly, including an escalation in violence in]{.mark} the
spring of [2018]{.mark}. **Since taking office, the Donald
J.**]{.underline} [[Trump]{.mark} administration has [continue]{.mark}d
[to pressure Russia over its involvement eastern
Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}. In January 2018, the United States imposed
new sanctions on twenty-one individuals and nine companies linked to the
conflict. In March 2018, the State Department approved the sale of
anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, the first sale of lethal weaponry since
the conflict began, and in July 2018 the Department of Defense announced
an additional \$200 million in defensive aid to Ukraine, bringing the
total amount of aid provided since 2014 to \$1 billion. In October 2018,
Ukraine joined the United States and seven other North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) countries in a series of large-scale air exercises
in western Ukraine. The exercises came after Russia held its annual
military exercises in September 2018, the largest since the fall of the
Soviet Union. The crisis in Ukraine began with protests in the capital
city of Kiev in November 2013 against Ukrainian President Viktor
Yanukovych's decision to reject a deal for greater economic integration
with the European Union. **[After a violent [crackdown]{.mark} by state
security [force]{.mark}s unintentionally [d]{.mark}rew an even greater
number of protesters and [escalated]{.mark} the [conflict,]{.mark}
President Yanukovych fled the country in February 2014.]{.underline}**

### War Inevitable

#### The Ukraine civil war shows no sign of ending

**GRI 19** (Global Risk Insight -- founded at the London School of
Economics (LSE) to revolutionize the political risk industry, and bring
it to the 21st century, "The Ukraine conflict in 2019: Prospects for
de-escalation look remote",
https://globalriskinsights.com/2019/01/prospects-for-de-escalating-the-conflict-in-eastern-ukraine/)

[Currently, [there is no progress towards]{.mark} the [implementation
of]{.mark} the Minsk [Agreements]{.mark}, [amid constant
ceasefire]{.mark} violations [and]{.mark} the continued presence of
[heavy weaponry in the conflict area.]{.mark} There are growing military
losses on both sides and ongoing civilian casualties.]{.underline}
Moreover, monitoring by the OSCE's SMM (Special Monitoring Mission)
faces severe impediments. Discussions within the framework of Normandy
Four format and the Trilateral Contact Group (TCG) on key issues--the
exchange of hostages, [[the ceasefire]{.mark} and withdrawal of heavy
weaponry, and illegal formations from the Ukrainian
territory--[have]{.mark} also [been fruitless]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
provisions of the Minsk Agreements on the withdrawal of heavy weaponry
and ceasefire control have been violated on numerous occasions. For
instance, over just a couple of weeks in December 2018, there were over
20,000 recorded ceasefire violations and 160 weapons used in direct
violation of the agreed withdrawal lines (most of the weapons were used
by pro-Russian separatists, in areas controlled by them). Overall, since
2016, there has been a steady increase in ceasefire violations in the
Donetsk region, with slightly fewer in the Luhansk region: in total,
there were 320,000 and 410,000 ceasefire violations in 2016 and 2017
respectively. Although the final data for 2018 is not yet available,
given this trend and reports throughout the year, we can expect the
number of ceasefire violations to remain at the same or even higher
level. [[The SMM continues to face difficulty with verifying the
withdrawal of heavy arms and ceasefire control]{.mark}, freedom of
movement and monitoring of situation along the perimeter [of conflict
area]{.mark}.]{.underline} In spite of an increase in OSCE observers, it
remains problematic for the SMM to monitor the area of the front line of
the conflict. The OSCE has at its disposal around 800 international
monitors, backed up by a recently relaunched drone surveillance program
and video cameras. Nevertheless, SMM's monitoring efforts have been
constantly limited due to restrictions of its freedom of movement. In
the period from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2018, SMM personnel were
restricted in its movement 758 times. A large majority of these
incidents (87%) occurred in the territories that are under the control
of pro-Russian separatists, up from 72% at the start of the given
period, which suggests that the degree of obstruction of the SMM's work
is increasing. At the same time, SMM's monitoring drones are often shut
down in the territories controlled by pro-Russian separatists, and video
surveillance cameras in the conflict area are attacked. [Since 2016,
[Ukraine has tried without notable success to reach an agreement on the
permanent deployment of]{.mark} SMM's [international monitors along the
conflict zone border]{.mark}, within the framework of the Minsk
Agreements.]{.underline} This has not materialized mainly because such a
change in the mandate of the OSCE's SMM requires a consensus of all 57
OSCE Member States at the OSCE Permanent Council, and Russia will not
support it.

### No Escalation

#### The Ukraine civil war won't escalate in a nuclear way

**Twickel 19** (Nikolaus von Twickel -- A Berlin-based writer focusing
on the war in Donbass, "The State of Play in the Donbass",
https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/03/11/the-state-of-play-in-the-donbass-a64764)

Nevertheless, [[Ukraine should not become a nuclear power]{.mark}.
[Its]{.mark} own [interests]{.mark} and those of the West [will best be
served if]{.mark} Kiev fulfills [it]{.mark}s oft-made pledges to [join
the Nonproliferation Treaty]{.mark} (npt) [as a nonnuclear weapon
state]{.mark}. [The benefits]{.mark} provided [by nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark} [are less certain and more conditional than the
proponents of nuclear prolif]{.mark}eration believe. When the costs and
complications associated with nuclear acquisition are taken into
account, [the case for Ukrainian nuclear weapons is not
compelling.]{.mark}]{.underline} The case for nuclear proliferation
rests on the pacific effects of nuclear weapons. As Kenneth Waltz
asserts in the most famous advocacy of proliferation, nuclear spread
\"will promote peace and reinforce international stability.\" Because
nuclear weapons greatly in- crease the costs and risks of war, they
induce caution in the behavior of states and substantially reduce the
likelihood of miscalculation. Wars between nuclear-armed states become
simply too dangerous to fight. The force of this argument is greatly
strengthened by the experience of the Cold War, in which the two
bitterly opposed protagonists avoided war for nearly half a century
despite numerous crises and provocations.

#### No dollar collapse, and even if it does there's no impact

**Ross 6-25**-19 Sean has a background which includes working as a

journalist. Sean is the founder and manager of Free Lances, Ltd., a hub
for freelance editors, researchers, and writers. *What it would take for
the U.S. dollar to collapse*
https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex-currencies/091416/what-would-it-take-us-dollar-collapse.asp

Ever since the launch of quantitative easing (QE), worried investors
have asked, \"will the U.S. dollar collapse?\" It is an interesting
question that might superficially appear plausible, **[but a [currency
crisis in the United States is unlikely]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Review
the dollar\'s strengths and weaknesses to see why.

History is full of sudden currency collapses. Argentina, Hungary,
Ukraine, Iceland, Venezuela, Zimbabwe and Germany have each experienced
terrible currency crises since 1900. **[Depending on your definition of
a collapse, the [Russian currency calamity]{.mark} during 2016 [could be
considered an]{.mark}other [example. The root]{.mark} of any collapse
[is a lack of faith in the stability]{.mark} or usefulness [of
money]{.mark} to serve as an effective store of value or medium of
exchange]{.underline}**. As soon as users stop believing that a currency
is useful, that currency is in trouble. This can be brought about
through **[improper valuations
or [pegging](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency-peg.asp),
chronic low growth
or[ inflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp).]{.underline}**

Ever since the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1944, other major governments
and central banks have relied on the U.S. dollar to back up the value of
their own currencies. Through its reserve currency status, the dollar
receives extra legitimacy in the eyes of domestic users, currency
traders and participants in international transactions.

**[[The U.S. dollar is not the only reserve currency]{.mark} in the
world]{.underline}**, though it is the most prevalent. As of September
2016, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved four other reserve
currencies: **[the euro, British pound sterling, Japanese yen and
Chinese yuan]{.underline}**. It is important that the dollar has
competitors as an international Reserve currency because it creates a
theoretical alternative for the rest of the world in case American
policymakers lead the dollar down a damaging path.

**[Finally, [the American economy is]{.mark} still [the largest and most
important]{.mark} economy in the world. Even though growth has slowed
significantly since 2001, the American economy still [regularly
outperforms]{.mark} its peers in [Europe and Japan. The dollar is backed
up by the]{.mark} productivity of [American]{.mark} worker[s]{.mark}, or
at least so long as American workers [continue to use the dollar]{.mark}
almost [exclusively]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[The fundamental weakness of the US dollar is that it is only valuable
through government fiat. This weakness is shared by every other major
national currency in the world]{.underline}** and is perceived as
normal in the modern age. However, as recently as the 1970s, it was
considered a somewhat radical proposition. Without the discipline
imposed by a commodity-based currency standard (such as gold), the worry
is that governments might print too much money for political purposes or
to conduct wars.

In fact, one reason the IMF was formed was to monitor the Federal
Reserve and its commitment to Bretton Woods. Today, the IMF uses the
other reserves as a discipline on Fed activity. **[If foreign
governments or investors decided to switch away from the U.S. dollar en
masse, the flood of short positions could significantly hurt anyone with
assets denominated in dollars.]{.underline}**

If the Federal Reserve creates money and the U.S. government assumes and
monetizes debt faster than the U.S. economy grows, the future value of
the currency should fall in absolute terms. Fortunately for the United
States, virtually every alternative currency is backed by similar
economic policies. Even if the dollar faltered in absolute terms, it may
still be stronger globally, due to its strength relative to the
alternatives.

There are some conceivable scenarios that might cause a sudden crisis
for the dollar. The most realistic is the dual threat of high inflation
and high debt, a scenario in which rising consumer prices force the Fed
to sharply raise interest rates. Much of the national debt is made up of
relatively short-term instruments, so a spike in rates would act like
an adjustable-rate mortgage after the teaser period ends. If the U.S.
government struggled to afford its interest payments, foreign creditors
could dump the dollar and trigger a collapse.

If the U.S. entered a steep recession or depression without dragging the
rest of the world with it, users might leave the dollar. Another option
would involve some major power, such as China or a post-European
Union Germany, reinstating a commodity-based standard and monopolizing
the reserve currency space. However, even in these scenarios, it is not
clear that the dollar necessarily would collapse.

**[The collapse of the dollar remains highly unlikely. [Of the
preconditions]{.mark} necessary to force a collapse, [only the prospect
of higher inflation]{.mark} [appears reasonable]{.mark}. Foreign
exporters such as [China and Japan do not want a dollar collapse]{.mark}
because the United States is too important a customer. And [even if the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [had to renegotiate or default]{.mark} on
some debt obligations, [there is little evidence]{.mark} that [the world
would]{.mark} [let the dollar collapse and risk]{.mark} possible
[contagion]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### No US dollar collapse anywhere in the near future

**Watson 15** (Patrick Watson - a compulsive trend-observer and senior
economic analyst. Patrick specializes in a global macro perspective,
"Why Not to Worry about a US Dollar Collapse" -- Mauldin Economics,
https://www.mauldineconomics.com/resources/why-not-to-worry-about-a-us-dollar-collapse)

In a world without fixed exchange rates, a nation can gain an advantage
by manipulating its currency so that the value appears lower. This makes
exports seem less expensive to foreign buyers while discouraging
imports. The US has played this game masterfully in recent
decades---keeping the dollar low while still importing mass quantities
of goods from abroad. Something changed in the last few years, though.
The chart below shows the US Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar's
value against a basket of other major currencies. Notice how it shot
higher in the last half of 2014 and then stabilized in a much higher
range in 2015. The US Federal Reserve's decision to end its "QE3"
stimulus program, [[A major reduction in US oil imports as domestic
shale production soared]{.mark}, [The]{.mark} European [Central
Bank]{.mark}'s move to [ease the continent's debt crisis with new
stimulus]{.mark}]{.underline}, and A massive devaluation of the Japanese
yen. Compared to other world currencies, the US dollar is hardly
collapsing. It is strengthening, and no other currency shows signs of
catching up. Some currencies, no doubt, will collapse in the coming
decades, but the dollar is way down the list. How can this be?
Ironically, [cutting all ties to gold actually helps the
dollar.]{.underline} Currency values are always relative to another
currency. That means it is mathematically impossible for every currency
to lose value. When you sell currency A (whatever it is), you must
simultaneously buy currency B. That means some currency will always be
on top of the pile\... even if the pile is sinking. [[The dolla]{.mark}r
has [stayed relatively strong, despite]{.mark} US [economic problems,
because other currencies look even worse]{.mark}. Many foreign investors
see the US as an island of stability in a storm-tossed world. They want
to own [dollar-denominated assets]{.mark}. That [keeps the dollar
strong]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, look at this chart showing the
US dollar exchange rate against the Japanese yen over the last five
years. In 2012, before the Bank of Japan launched its latest stimulus
program, it only took around 80 yen to buy a dollar. By mid-2015, the
rate was over 120 yen to the dollar. If you are an American investor
worried about the dollar, imagine how this must look to Japanese
investors. They might gladly trade places with you, if they could get
dollars in exchange. The same applies, more or less, to all other
currencies. [The dollar looks more attractive than the home currencies
of many foreign investors[. Anything can happen in the short
term]{.mark}, of course, [but a dollar collapse is unlikely in this
environment.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### US dollar hegemony cannot be replaced

member of the American Numismatic Association, Industry Council For

[There is a]{.underline}n alarming [trend in which more and more
countries are seeking to gain independence from the US
dollar.]{.underline} Here's what's been happening lately: Last week,
Iran announced its plans to adopt the euro in place of the dollar as its
main currency for international exchange. A few months ago, Venezuela
attempted to launch an oil-backed cryptocurrency. Earlier this year,
China introduced the first ever yuan-denominated oil contracts; a
successful event that raised the yuan's status on the international
stage. In the meantime, Russia has been actively increasing its gold
reserves. Their primary goal is not only to end dollar dependence but to
end the US dollar's global dominance. [Despite their efforts,
[none]{.mark} of them have [come close to dethroning the dollar's global
status.]{.mark} Amid tensions between the US and other nations,
including its allies, and Trump's preference for a strong dollar, some
analysts believe that the [countries maneuvering against the dollar are

[[Protectionism of the petrodollar]{.underline}]{.mark} can be an
ulterior motive that [[explains US intervention into oil-exporting
nations]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the years after Saddam's announcement,
President George Bush asserted that his regime  possessed weapons of
mass destruction. Following  9/11, [[the United States]{.mark} invaded
Iraq, deposed  Saddam Hussein, and [converted Iraqi oil sales back to
the U.S. dollar]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[This exact pattern was repeated
with Muammar Gaddafi]{.underline}]{.mark} when he attempted to create a
unified African currency backed by Libyan  gold reserves to to sell
African oil. [Shortly after his announcement, rebels armed by the US
government and allies overthrew the dictator and his regime. [After his

Since the fall of the USSR in 1991, Rancourt says, **[[US war campaigns
have]{.underline}]{.mark}**, among other things, **[[protected the US
dollar from abandonment]{.underline}]{.mark}**, destroyed nations
seeking sovereignty from US dominance, secured the opium trade,
increased control over oil and have frustrated Eurasian integration.

In addition, we have seen **[[certain countries face]{.mark} a
bombardment of [sanctions and hostility]{.mark} in an attempt [to
destroy energy-producing centres]{.mark} that [the US does not
control]{.mark},]{.underline}** not least Russia.

Since that day \[dissolution of Bretton Woods\], **[[a true financial

**[[This means that the Americans can obtain material wealth from the

If we \[now\] acknowledge that there is a US dollar index cycle
\[punctuated by engineered crises, including war\] and the Americans use
this cycle to harvest from other countries, then we can conclude that it
was time for the Americans to harvest China...

### AT Petro-Yuan

#### The petrodollar doesn't exist and there's no impact

The Petro-Dollar Is A Myth, And The Petro-Yuan Mere Fantasy\", 4/26/18

[China\'s]{.underline} recent introduction of yuan-denominated oil
futures [has attracted some fairly extensive press
commentary.]{.underline} Partly this is down to a habit of
over-interpreting everything happening in China as just more evidence of
their unstoppable rise to global superpower status, but it is also due
to some profound misconceptions about the importance of oil as a
commodity. [It is widely thought]{.underline}, for example, [that oil
somehow underwrites the global financial system and guarantees the U.S.
dollar\'s hegemonic status.]{.underline}

Inevitably, stories about the toppling of the \"Petro-dollar\" and the
long yearned for rise of an alternative reserve currency, one not
dependent on the whims of a capricious political elite in Washington,
have proliferated across the alter-net and on the state-backed media
platforms of Russia and China.

But we should be clear: [[the Petro-dollar does not exist]{.mark}, and
really hasn\'t done in any meaningful way since the 1970s]{.underline},
therefore [the \"[Petro-yuan\" has no
future]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} This is not to say that oil will
never be traded in yuan, that is likely, but it is to say that [[trading
oil in yuan will not suddenly transform the currency into the global
reserve many claim is inevitable.]{.underline}]{.mark}

currency in the financial markets, replacing the European Currency Unit.
On January 1, 2002, Euro banknotes were released into circulation and
gradually replaced the national banknotes of the original member states
of the Eurozone. Note the drop of the dollar's share, from 71.5% in 2001
to 66.5% in 2002. Today, the euro has replaced 19 national currencies.
The **[[combined share of]{.mark} the dollar and the [euro edged down to
82.4% in]{.mark}]{.underline}** Q4 **[[2018]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
remaining currencies make up 17.6% of allocated global reserve
currencies. On October 1, 2016, the IMF added the Chinese renminbi to
its currency basket, the Special Drawing Rights (SDR), elevating it to
an official global reserve currency. Hopes by some folks that it would
dethrone the dollar as hegemon have been disappointed.

#### There are four interlocking pieces to this monetary hegemony: (1) The ability to force other countries to trade in dollars, (2) controlling access to the global payments system, (3) the primacy of the dollar as a global reserve currency (4) the nature of the dollar as a fiat currency. These are all currently under threat.

**[[The dollar as a unit of account]{.underline}]{.mark}**

By forcing other to price goods and services in dollars, the U.S.
creates demand for its currency. This requires buyers to find ways to
earn dollars to pay for their purchases. However, **[[because the dollar
is a fiat currency]{.underline}]{.mark}** (more on this below), the
**[[U.S. can create dollars literally out of thin air without providing
anything of value in exchange for a new batch]{.underline}]{.mark}** (or
boatload) of dollars. As American economist Barry Eichengreen noted \"It
costs only a few cents for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to
produce a 100 dollars\' bill, but other countries had to pony up 100
dollars\' of actual goods in order to obtain one.\"

**[[Control of the global payment system]{.underline}]{.mark}**

However, on June 28, France, Germany and the UK announced that an
**[alternative payment system called Instex became
operational]{.underline}**. This payment balancing system permits
companies in Europe to buy Iranian goods, and vice-versa, without
accessing SWIFT. Given the growing number of countries which **[[the
U.S. has threatened with economic aggression
including]{.underline}]{.mark}** China, Iran, Russia, Venezuela and
others, **[[the desire for an alternative payment system is
undeniable]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The dollar two-step: **[[A fiat currency becomes the global reserve
currency]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Before August 13, 1971 the U.S. dollar was backed by gold-meaning that a
dollar could be converted into a certain amount of gold, a physical
commodity with real value. However on that fateful day, President Nixon
declared that **[[dollars could no longer be exchanged for gold or any
other reserve asset and turned the dollar in fiat
money]{.underline}]{.mark}** (meaning a currency with no intrinsic
value).

But to sustain global demand for the dollar, the U.S. also reached an
agreement in the 1970s whereby Saudi Arabia would only accept payment
for oil in dollars irrespective of whom or where the buyer was. With oil
being the world\'s most valuable commodity, this ensured that countries
everywhere would need to secure dollars to both settle oil purchases and
hedge against oil price changes and to manage the value of their own
currencies. As noted above, this allowed the U.S. to enforce the dollar
as a global unit of account. **[[Combined with the ability to print
money, this provided the fuel for unlimited spending and American
hegemony.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Both those the **[[U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark}** deems
**[[adversaries]{.mark}]{.underline}** such as Iran, and Russia as well
as ostensible allies like France, Germany and the UK have increasingly
compelling and urgent reasons to **[[circumvent dollar
hegemony.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[While appearing unassailable, the dollar may be much more vulnerable
than many suspects]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The reporting by some
well-known western business media outlets only reinforces these
erroneous perceptions since those doing the reporting seem to not have a
sufficient grasp of the underlying accounting and economic principles
underpinning dollar hegemony.

Events described above demonstrate that the countdown to **[[the demise
of dollar hegemony has begun.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Given the
accelerating pace of technological, social and political change, its end
may be arrives sooner than expected.

[[China,]{.mark} with its giant economy, [has]{.mark} a huge [influence

it is also the largest import partner whose imports were valued at \$
505.5 billion as of 2017, according to the Office of the United States
Trade Representative. The Chinese are just putting in place the
financial plumbing that could, if it finds support from relevant reforms
and the essential political action, lay the grounds for a future where
RMB would be of immense global prominence. Under the controversial
global development strategy, Belt and Road Initiative, which is aimed at
financing infrastructure projects in 152 countries as well as
international organizations across regions, [[China offered
incentives]{.mark} to the recipient countries [to use the RMB as

eased down interest rates to zero, that helps in making [the Chinese
bond market]{.mark} quite [attractive for the foreign
investors]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, although a flourishing Chinese
economy is backing the RMB's international stature, there are some
limitations in terms of China's fixed-exchange rate regime and rigid
capital account. The nation restricts capital movements to maintain
control over its domestic economy. Moreover, RMB is not a freely
convertible currency that poses another shortcoming to become the global
currency. While China's quest for the internationalisation of its RMB is
recent, the Europeans have been contemplating to do so with their
explicit ambition.

**[No longer international monetary [transactions]{.mark} controlled by
US banks]{.underline}** and -- by the US-dollar controlled international
transfer system, SWIFT, the system that allows and facilitates US
financial and economic sanctions of all kinds -- confiscation of foreign
funds, stopping trades between countries, blackmailing 'unwilling'
nations into submission.

What would happen? -- Well, the short answer is that we would certainly
be a step close to world peace, **[[away from US (financial)
hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark}**, towards nation states' sovereignty,
**[[towards a world geopolitical structure of more
equality.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

We are not there yet. But graffities are all over the walls signaling
that we are **[[moving]{.mark} quite rapidly [in that
direction.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

And Trump knows it and his handlers know it -- which is why the
onslaught of **[financial crime -- sanctions -- trade wars -- foreign
assets and reserves confiscations]{.underline}**, or outright theft --
all in the name of "Make America Great Again", is accelerating
exponentially and with impunity.

What is surprising is that the **[[Anglo-Saxon hegemons do not]{.mark}
seem to [understand]{.mark} that all the [threats, sanctions, trade
barriers, are provoking the contrary to what should contribute to
American Greatness.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Once the world gets sick and tired of the grotesque dictate of
Washington and the sanction schemes for those who do no longer want to
go along with the oppressive rules of the US, they will be eager to jump
on another boat, or boats -- **[[abandoning the dollar and valuing their
own currencies.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[The US-dollar]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a fiat currency, by its sheer
money mass, may bend national economies up or down, depending in which
direction the country **[[is favored by the
hegemon]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Let's put the absurdity of this
phenomenon in perspective.

Today, **[[the dollar is based not even on hot air and is worth less
than the paper it is printed on]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The US GDP is
US\$ 21.1 trillion in 2019 (World Bank estimate), with current debt of
22.0 trillion, or about 105% of GDP. The world GDP is projected for 2019
at US\$ 88.1 trillion (World Bank).

According to Forbes, about US\$ **[[210 trillion are "unfunded
liabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}**" (net present value of future
projected but unfunded obligations (75 years), mainly social security,
Medicaid and accumulated interest on debt), a figure about 10 times the
US GDP, or two and a half times the world's economic output.

This figure keeps growing, as **[[interest on debt is
compounded]{.underline}]{.mark}**, forming part of what would be called
in business terms 'debt service' (interest and debt amortization), but
is never 'paid back'.

This **[[monstrous debt]{.mark} is]{.underline}** partly owned **[[in
the form of]{.mark} treasury [bonds]{.mark} as foreign exchange reserves
by countries [around the world.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[The bulk of it is owed [by the US to itself]{.mark} -- with no plans
[to ever "pay it back]{.mark}"]{.underline}** -- but rather create more
money, more debt, with which to pay for the non-stop wars, weapon
manufacturing and lie-propaganda to keep the populace quiet and in
lockstep.

It would generate a chain reaction that might **[[bring down the whole
dollar-dependent world economy]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It would create
an exponential "Lehman Brothers 2008" **[[on global
scale]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

The world is increasingly aware of this real threat**[, [an economy
built on a house of cards]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- and **[[countries
want to get out of the trap, out of the fangs of the
US-dollar]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It's not easy with all the
dollar-denominated reserves and assets invested abroad, all over the
globe.

A solution may be gradually divesting them (US-dollar liquidity and
investments) and moving into non-dollar dependent currencies, like
**[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}** Chinese **[[Yuan and
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** Russian **[[Ruble]{.mark},]{.underline}** or
a basket of eastern currencies that are **[[delinked from the
dollar]{.underline}]{.mark}** and its international payment scheme, the
SWIFT system.

There are increasingly blockchain technology alternatives available[.
**[China, Russia, Iran and Venezuela]{.underline}**]{.mark} are already
**[[experimenting with]{.underline}]{.mark}** government-controlled
**[[cryptocurrencies to build new payment and transfer systems outside
the US-dollar domain to circumvent sanctions.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Any country is welcome to join this new alliance of countries and new
but fast-growing approach to alternative trading -- and **[[to finding
back to national political and financial
sovereignty.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

In the long-run, the **[[benefits of German-Russian business and
economic relations will far outweigh the illegal US
sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Once this awareness has sunk in, there
is nothing to stop Russian-German business associations to flourish, and
to attract other EU-Russian business relations -- all outside of the
dollar-dominated banking and transfer system.

President Trump's trade war with China will eventually also have **[[a

"[Ultimately, [we will have reserve currencies other than the U.S.
dollar]{.mark}]{.underline}," the Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney
announced last month. [Sixty-one percent of foreign currency reserves
are in dollars]{.underline}. [[As these]{.mark} dollar currency reserves
[are replaced by other currencies]{.mark}, [the retreat from the dollar
will accelerate]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The [recklessness of America's
financial policies]{.mark} [will]{.mark} only [exacerbate the
crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}. "If unlimited borrowing, financed by
printing money, were a path to prosperity," Irwin M. Stelzer of the
Hudson Institute said recently, "then Venezuela and Zimbabwe would be
top of the growth tables." McCoy explains what a world financial order
untethered from the dollar would look like: For the majority of
Americans, the 2020s will likely be remembered as a demoralizing decade
of rising prices, stagnant wages, and fading international
competitiveness. After years of swelling deficits fed by incessant
warfare in distant lands, [[in 2030 the U.S. dollar]{.mark} eventually
[loses its]{.mark} special [status as]{.mark} the [world's
dominant]{.mark} reserve [currency.]{.mark}]{.underline} Suddenly, there
are punitive price increases for American imports ranging from clothing
to computers. And the costs for all overseas activity surges as well,
making travel for both tourists and troops prohibitive. Unable to pay
for swelling deficits by selling now-devalued Treasury notes abroad,
Washington is finally forced to slash its bloated military budget. Under
pressure at home and abroad, its forces begin to pull back from hundreds
of overseas bases to a continental perimeter. Such a desperate move,
however, comes too late. [[Faced with a fading superpower incapable of
paying its bills]{.mark}, China, India, Iran, Russia, and [other
powers]{.mark} provocatively [challenge U.S. dominion]{.mark} over the
oceans, space, and cyberspace.]{.underline} The collapse of the dollar
will mean, McCoy writes, "soaring prices, ever-rising unemployment, and
a continuing decline in real wages throughout the 2020s, domestic
divisions widen into violent clashes and divisive debates, often over
symbolic, insubstantial issues." The deep disillusionment and widespread
rage will give an opening to Trump, or a Trump-like demagogue, to lash
out, perhaps by inciting violence, against scapegoats at home and
abroad. But by then the U.S. empire will be so diminished its threats
will be, at least to those outside its borders, largely meaningless.
[[It is **impossible to predict** when this flight from the dollar will
take place]{.underline}]{.mark}. By the second half of the 19th century,
the U.S. economy had overtaken Britain, but it was not until the middle
of the 20th century that the dollar replaced the pound sterling to
become the dominant currency in international trade. The pound
sterling's share of currency reserves among international central banks
fell from around 60 percent in the early 1950s to less than 5 percent by
the 1970s. Its value declined from more than 4 dollars per pound at the
end of WWII to near-parity with the dollar. The British economy went
into a tailspin. [And that economic jolt marked for the British, as it
will [for us, the end of an empire.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### **Collapse of dollar hegemony *cannot be stopped***

**Shea 5/28** (Rainer Shea, a political jounalist for multiple
companies, uses the written word to construct establishment propaganda

Fully Visible, But We're in the Final Years of the American
Empire\"https://ghionjournal.com/it-may-not-be-fully-visible-but-were-in-the-final-years-of-the-american-empire/)

But reality will catch up with the empire's attempts to halt its own
unraveling. [[America's]{.mark} great undoing will be the [collapse of
the dollar]{.mark}---an eventuality which the U.S. [has been]{.mark}
[trying to stave off]{.mark} [by intervening]{.mark} in Iran and
Venezuela [due to]{.mark} their [rejection of]{.mark} America's
[currency.]{.mark} If the [U.S]{.mark}. were to conquer both of these
countries, it still [wouldn't be able to halt]{.mark} the [transition
away from American trade]{.mark} dominance [that nations around the
world are making]{.mark}.]{.underline} With Bush's unilateral invasion
of Iraq, the U.S. lost the respect of many nations around the world, and
[[Trump]{.mark}'s trade wars and rejections of international agreements
like the Paris climate accord have [accelerated this rupture between the
U.S. and the rest of the world]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[America's global
dollar reserves are being replaced by other
currencies]{.mark}.]{.underline} And as this process continues, it's
going to combine with the country's internal financial mismanagement to
create a 21st century Great Depression. [By the end of the 2020s, the
U.S. may be so economically crippled that it will have to withdraw its
global military forces en masse]{.underline}. [[This will represent the
final death of the American empire]{.underline}]{.mark}, which historian
Alfred McCoy has predicted will come around the year 2030. At that
point, writes McCoy, the country will be experiencing "soaring prices,
ever-rising unemployment, and a continuing decline in real wages
throughout the 2020s, \[as\] domestic divisions widen into violent
clashes and divisive debates, often over symbolic, insubstantial
issues." [[The decline of the dollar]{.mark}, as well as potential wars
with Iran, Russia, and China, are going to be the "stress
test"]{.underline} that Orlov anticipates [[will end America as we know
it]{.underline}. **[This collapse can't be
stopped]{.underline}**]{.mark}. The question is what will happen after
American dominance goes under. This question will be decided by those
who make the choice between whether they'll continue to support
capitalism, or fight for a world that isn't controlled by fascistic
governments and powerful multinational corporations[. After the U.S.
loses its power, the corporatocracy will use the private armies of
mercenary companies like Blackwater to carry out its regime change
projects.]{.underline} Already, Blackwater is aiming to cash in on
American desires for continued military involvement by becoming part of
the wars in Afghanistan and Syria. [This privatization of the empire
will be an unprecedented corporate takeover, and it will be facilitated
by a collection of world powers that have embraced ethno-nationalism and
authoritarianism.]{.underline} It's entirely possible that The European
Union will work as one of these authoritarian powers; its recent efforts
to control information and exert police power over the populations of
its member countries show that the EU could soon become an instrument
for social control within its region. [This will be paralleled by a
plethora of countries which are quickly shifting towards despotism and
ethnic nationalism, with [America having some of the greatest potential
for falling into tyranny.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Too many alt causes \-- dollar heg will inevitably collapse

**Palley 06** (Thomas Palley, Palley runs the Economics for Democratic
and Open Societies Project, and is the former chief economist of the
US-China Economic & Security Review Commission. He is the author of
"Plenty of Nothing: The Downsizing of the American Dream and the Case
for Structural Keynesianism" (Princeton University Press, 1998), \"Why
Dollar Hegemony is Unhealthy\", 6/20/06,
https://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/why-dollar-hegemony-unhealthy)

[Conventional theory says the dollar will only lose its dominance when
countries become saturated with dollar holdings.]{.underline} At that
stage they will cease buying and may even sell dollars, causing the
currency to fall. [The problem with this story is that [countries have
no incentive to sell dollars]{.mark}, as this would kill the golden
goose of export-led growth.]{.underline}

The buyer-of-last-resort story suggests a different take[. [One reason
the dollar could topple is if countries finally manage to develop their
own consumption markets]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Countries in the Euro
zone are most capable of doing this, but for the moment they are gripped
by policymaking that is obsessed with inflation and afraid of growth.
China needs to improve its income distribution in a way that links
income distribution to]{.underline} productivity. Unions are the natural
way to do this, but are blocked by China's totalitarian political system
that fears such organization.

[[An alternative source of collapse is if American consumers reduce
spending because they feel overextended]{.underline}, [the Fed raises
interest rates too high]{.underline} or [American banks tighten lending
standards]{.underline}]{.mark}. In this event, [the]{.underline} US
[economy would stall]{.underline} and the dollar could fall owing to
diminished economic prospects in the US.

All three theories have merit, but in today's economic environment [[the
buyer-of-last-resort theory is especially relevant.]{.mark} As long as
other countries fail to generate sufficient demand in their own markets,
they will be compelled to rely on the US market and pay dollar
tribute.]{.underline}

However, none are well served by this co-dependence. Other countries
resent the special situation that exempts the US from trade-deficit
discipline. Side by side, the long-term economic prospects of the US are
undermined by the erosion of the manufacturing sector, while [US workers
face wage and job pressures from imports that are advantaged by the
dollar's overvaluation]{.underline}. Moreover, [[all are vulnerable to a
sudden stop of the system resulting from financial overextension of the
US consumer.]{.underline}]{.mark}

**[[[China](https://www.thebalance.com/china-economy-facts-effect-on-us-economy-3306345) wants]{.mark}
its currency,
[the [yuan](https://www.thebalance.com/china-s-currency-the-yuan-or-renmimbi-3305906),
to replace the]{.mark} [[U.S.

the [world\'s global
currency](https://www.thebalance.com/world-currency-3305931)]{.mark}.
That would [give it more control over its
economy.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[As [China\'s economic might grows]{.mark}, it\'s taking steps to make
that happen.]{.underline}** A slim majority of institutional investors
see it as inevitable, but don\'t say when. Could we see a switch from a
greenback to a redback-dominated world? If so, how and when would that
happen? What would be the consequences?

Before the yuan can become a global currency, **[[it]{.mark} must first
be [successful ]{.mark}]{.underline}**[[**[as a reserve
currency]{.underline}**](https://www.bloomberg.com/tosv2.html?vid=&uuid=38a92240-977f-11e9-afc0-f98822891179&url=L25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAxNS0wMy0yMy93aHktY2hpbmEtd2FudHMtaXRzLXl1YW4tdG8tYmUtdGhlLXdvcmxkLXMtNXRoLXJlc2VydmUtY3VycmVuY3k=)]{.mark} .
That would give China the following five benefits:

The **[yuan would be used to price more international
contracts]{.underline}**. China exports a lot of commodities that are
traditionally priced in U.S. dollars. **[If they were priced in yuan,
China would not have to worry so much about the dollar\'s
value.]{.underline}**

All central banks would have to hold yuan as part of their foreign
exchange reserves. The yuan would be in higher demand. That would lower
interest rates for bonds denominated in yuan.

Chinese exporters would have lower borrowing costs.

China would have more economic clout in relation to the United States.

**[[It would support]{.mark} President [Jinping\'s [economic
reforms](https://www.thebalance.com/china-economic-reform-3305479)]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
(Source: \"Why China Wants the Yuan to Be a Reserve Currency,\"
Bloomberg, March 23, 2015.)

On November 30, 2015, the International Monetary Fund awarded the
yuan status as a reserve currency. The IMF added the yuan to its Special
Drawing Rights basket on October 1, 2016. This basket currently includes
the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, and U.S. dollar. 

Why did the IMF make this decision? China's leaders want to improve
the standard of living to avoid another revolution. The People's Bank of
China kept the yuan at a fixed exchange rate to the dollar. That allowed
China\'s economic growth to soar thanks to low-cost exports to the
United States. As a result, China\'s share of international
trade and gross domestic product grew to around 10 percent.

**[[As trade grew, so did the yuan\'s popularity]{.mark}. In August
2015, [it became the fourth most-used currency in the
world](https://www.bloomberg.com/tosv2.html?vid=&uuid=3902b3f0-977f-11e9-8c6b-635433604ee8&url=L25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAxNS0xMC0wNi95dWFuLW92ZXJ0YWtlcy15ZW4tYXMtd29ybGQtcy1mb3VydGgtbW9zdC11c2VkLXBheW1lbnRzLWN1cnJlbmN5).]{.underline}**
It rose from 13th place in just three years. It surpassed the
Japanese yen, Canadian loonie, and the Australian dollar.

Central banks should increase their foreign exchange reserves of yuan to
provide funds for that level of trade. Central banks alone should
purchase about \$700 billion worth of yuan. But banks never purchased
all the euros they should have, even when the European Union was
the world\'s largest economy. Most international transactions are still
done in U.S. dollars, even though its trade has dropped. 

The IMF requires China to liberalize its capital markets. It should
allow the yuan to be freely traded on foreign exchange markets. That
allows central banks to hold it as a reserve currency. For that to
happen, China\'s central bank must relax the yuan\'s peg to the dollar.

China must have clearer communications about its future actions
regarding the yuan. That\'s what the Federal Reserve does at each of its
eight Federal Open Market Committee meetings.

On August 14, 2015, the PBOC relaxed the yuan to dollar conversion rate.
Instead of a fixed exchange rate, it would set the yuan\'s value to its
closing value on the previous day. Instead of rising, as many expected,
the yuan fell 3 percent over the next two days.

The PBOC stabilized the rate. It now has the freedom to allow the yuan
to be a stronger tool in monetary policy. The drop also silenced critics
of China\'s reforms, many of whom were members of the U.S. Congress.
They had warned that the yuan\'s value would rise as much as 30 percent
or more. That would destroy China's competitive advantage as an
exporter. 

On November 30, 2015, the PBOC informally communicated it will allow the
yuan to depreciate between 3 percent and 5 percent in 2016. On December
11, 2015, the Bank announced it would begin to shift the dollar peg to a
basket of currencies. That basket includes the dollar, euro, yen, and 10
other currencies. 

Chinese leaders are beginning to make it easier to trade the yuan in
foreign exchange markets. To do this risks more open financial and
political systems. On March 23, 2015, China backed the Renminbi Trading
Hub for the Americas. The renminbi is another name for the yuan.
That makes it easier for North American companies to conduct yuan
transactions in Canadian banks. China opened up similar trading hubs in
Singapore and London. 

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is Chair of the Working
Group on U.S. RMB Trading and Clearing group. It is creating a renminbi
trading center in the United States. The group includes former U.S.
Treasury Secretaries Hank Paulson and Tim Geithner. Such a center would
lower costs for U.S. companies trading with China. It would also allow
U.S. financial companies to offer yuan-denominated hedges and other
derivatives.

**[On June 9, 2016, [China granted the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates a
quota of [250 billion yuan]{.mark}, the equivalent of \$38 billion,
under China\'s Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor
program. It appointed one Chinese and one U.S. bank to conduct [RMB
clearing business in the United
States](http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/987588.shtml). ]{.underline}**

The level of trade is not the only reason the U .S. dollar is the
world\'s reserve currency. The strength of the U.S. economy instills
trust. Most important are the transparency of U.S. financial markets and
the stability of its monetary policy. 

On the other hand, Stuart Oakley, managing director of Nomura,
pointed out in a 2013 article that **[[China owns \$5 trillion
of]{.mark} unallocated central bank [reserves]{.mark} and these could be
[in yuan]{.mark}. As more bilateral [swap
lines](https://www.thebalance.com/swap-line-definition-purpose-examples-3305966) are
set up and China moves further down its path of capital market
liberalization, central banks\' appetite to own this currency will
grow.]{.underline}**

**[Could [China\'s ambition to make the yuan the world\'s currency lead
to a dollar collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}**? Probably not. Instead,
**[it will be a long, slow process that results in a [dollar decline,
not a
collapse](https://www.thebalance.com/dollar-decline-or-dollar-collapse-3306090). ]{.underline}**

[[The U.S. dollar was off]{.mark} slightly [versus its biggest
rival]{.mark}s Wednesday [after data showed the pace of Chinese economic
growth]{.mark} steadied i[n the first quarter,]{.mark}]{.underline}
helping to soothe fears of a global economic slowdown.

The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.01% a measure of the currency against
six major rivals, was off 0.1% at 96.918. The U.S. unit traded at 111.99
Japanese yen USDJPY, -0.11% down marginally from its level late Tuesday
in New York trading at ¥112.02. The euro EURUSD, -0.0090% fetched
\$1.1308, up from \$1.1283.

[[China's economy grew 6.4%]{.mark} year over year [in the first three
months of 2019,]{.mark} according to government data, [matching the pace
of]{.mark} growth in the [final quarter of 2018]{.mark} and coming in
slightly above expectations [for an expansion of
6.3%.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The data was seen tentatively soothing worries that troubles for the
world's second-largest economy would contribute to a global slowdown. As
a result, currencies viewed as bets on improving global economic growth
gained ground.

"It was risk-on overnight as headline Chinese data were strong across
the board," said Sue Trinh, head of Asia emerging market FX strategy at
RBC, in a note.

She cautioned, however, that upbeat data showing faster retail sales
growth and falling unemployment don't square with other evidence on
factory shutdowns, falling auto sales and a sharp slowdown in import
growth.

The Australian dollar AUDUSD, -0.2427% was a big gainer in the wake of
the China data, jumping to a more-than-two-month high versus its U.S.
counterpart to trade as high as 72.08 U.S. cents. It remains up 0.3% at
71.92 cents.

The Aussie, meanwhile, soared versus its antipodean rival, the New
Zealand dollar AUDNZD, -0.2297% after a weaker-than-expected
first-quarter inflation reading (1.5% versus 1.7% expected) stoked
expectations for a rate cut by New Zealand's central bank. The
Australian currency remained up 0.8% versus the currency known as the
kiwi at NZ\$1.0685 after trading at its highest level of 2019 at
NZ\$1.0737, according to FactSet.

"The big drop in NZD despite the better-than-expected China data shows,
first off, the dominance of domestic factors versus external ones, plus
Australia's greater interdependence with China: China takes 39% of
Australia's exports vs 27% of New Zealand's (32% of total trade versus
23%)," wrote Marshall Gittler, chief strategist at ACLS Global, in a
note.

Consumer prices rose 1.9% in the year through February, compared with an
annual gain of 1.8% the previous 12 months, the Office for National
Statistics said Wednesday.

replaced as the world's reserve currency. [But it's only now that world
[financial authorities are admitting the obvious.]{.mark}]{.underline}

With the dollar having lost 85% of its value since the gold window was
closed in 1971, it continues to lose purchasing power year after year as
the Federal Reserve continues to create trillions of dollars worth of
new money. While the Fed remains adamant that the dollar won't be
supplanted, the Bank of England disagrees.

[[Bank of England Governor]{.mark} Mark Carney [was]{.mark} remarkably
[frank]{.mark} about the dollar's demise in a recent AMA-style forum on
the Bank of England's website. In his view [the dollar will]{.mark}
eventually [be supplanted by the]{.mark} Chinese
[yuan.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Among the reasons Carney cited for his stance are:

[[Emerging market economies]{.mark} (including China[) make up 60% of
the global economy;]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The US only has a 10% share of]{.mark} international
[trade]{.mark};]{.underline}

That lag between global trade and economic importance and reserve
currency status will eventually be overcome.

Carney noted that even though the US overtook Britain in the late 19th
century as the world's largest, it still took until the 1920s before the
dollar became a dominant currency in international trade. [With China
nipping at the US economy's heels, [it may only be a few years before
China's economy surpasses the US]{.mark} in size. From there [it's only
a matter of time before the yuan]{.mark} completely [replaces the
dollar.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[With Russia, India, and other countries]{.mark} increasingly [adopting
the yuan in]{.mark} international [trade, the dollar is]{.mark} being
[sidelined.]{.mark}]{.underline} That's bad news for American investors
who hold dollar-denominated stocks and bonds. When the dollar loses its
reserve status the value of those investments will plunge. Thankfully
there's a way for investors to protect themselves once that happens:
investing in gold.

With the Bank of England now understanding that the dollar will be
supplanted as the world's reserve currency, will the Fed step up and
take responsibility or will it throw ordinary investors under the bus?
Given the decreasing purchasing power of the dollar over the past 50
years and the dramatic increase in the value of gold, we'll bet on the
latter.

Is US Dominance In The Oil Trade Waning As China Begins Using RMB For
Payment?, Forbes \|\|
https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahsu/2018/04/05/the-almighty-dollar-is-us-dominance-in-the-oil-trade-waning-as-china-begins-using-rmb-for-payment/#22259527bc87

In a challenge to longstanding American dominance of the oil industry,
[[China is]{.mark} reportedly [planning to launch a]{.mark} pilot
[program to pay for oil in]{.mark} its own [RMB,]{.mark} potentially
starting in the second half of this year.]{.underline} Regulators have
asked several financial institutions to prepare to price oil imports in
RMB. [Two of China's top suppliers, [Russia and Angola,]{.mark} may be
[asked to trade in RMB]{.mark}, and China recently began trading oil
futures in its own currency.]{.underline}

China surpassed the U.S. as top oil importer last year, importing 8.4
million barrels per day versus U.S. imports of 7.9 barrels per day. [Due
to its status as a major market for crude oil, [China launched RMB crude
futures]{.mark} on March 26.]{.underline} [[The new futures market
received]{.mark} a warm welcome, with [a 20 million barrel
turnover]{.mark} by the market close [on the first
day.]{.mark}]{.underline} What does this mean, then, for China's
potential to use the RMB in oil import payments, and will this mark the
beginning of the end for dollar dominance in the oil trade?

Potential of using RMB payments

Some say yes, some say no. There is some demand for an end to the U.S.
monopoly over the oil trade[. Countries like [Russia and Angola favor
ending dollar dominance]{.mark} in the global oil industry,]{.underline}
as this has helped the United States to maintain a global economic
hegemony and exert its political and economic influence. Nations that
wish to reduce exposure to U.S. political risk (including the politics
of sanctions) may be eager to reduce the importance of the U.S. dollar
in world trade in favor of stable alternative trading currencies. If a
number of oil-rich nations take up China's would-be RMB-denominated oil
trade, the centrality of the dollar in the oil trade will be diminished.

However, other analysts have made the case that, due to restrictions on
China's capital account and the daily fixed level of the RMB, the
potential for extensive commodities trading in RMB is less attractive
than other options available to foreign investors. Another reason
trading in RMB may be less desirable is because the government often
intervenes in markets when instability is perceived. These factors have
generated wariness among would-be foreign traders, who like to trade in
liquid and predictable markets.

Will this end dollar dominance in oil trade?

Countries like China and Russia wish to reduce their dependence on the
dollar, and this appears to be a strategic goal. [Increased use of [the
RMB]{.mark} in oil trading settlements **[will]{.mark}** likely
[**challenge** the supremacy of **the
dollar**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} but this will take time because
the dollar is so entrenched around the world. The dollar is used not
only for commodities trading, but also as a key marker in exchange rate
regimes and as an essential reserve currency. This convention has been
in use since the Bretton Woods meeting after World War II, when the rest
of the world (outside of the U.S.) was coping with economic and monetary
instability.

At present, the dollar comprises about 64% of world reserve currencies
(with the next largest being the euro at 20%). One-third of global GDP
is generated by countries that fix their currencies to the dollar and
85% of foreign exchange trading involves the U.S. dollar. By contrast,
the RMB comprises about 1% of global reserves. Despite recent turmoil in
the U.S. stock markets due to political volatility, the U.S. is still
considered the strongest economy in the world. While that doesn't mean
that its hegemonic status will last forever, [China will have to prove
to the world that it is not only politically and economically strong,
but that it is stable and profitable. [When]{.mark} that [time comes,
China will be able to increase]{.mark} the role of the [RMB in]{.mark}
the [oil trade]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Despite the forces against the RMB as a global currency, [[it does have
the potential to replace the dollar]{.mark} in the oil trade over
time.]{.underline} This may take decades, however, and is contingent on
the economic decline of the U.S. and continued growth and liberalization
in China. In that case, the RMB will be more widely used, and,
specifically in the oil trade, may be used not only for Chinese imports
of oil but for the oil trade amongst other nations that are interested
in building up RMB reserves.

This time may never come, but, as a scholar of economic history, [I see
it as entirely possible.]{.underline} Undoubtedly, the U.K. could not
have predicted that America would overtake it as global hegemon after
World War II. [That China has RMB internationalization as a long-term
objective makes the rise of the yuan all the more plausible; [it is in
the crosshairs.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Europe hopes to rival US dollar as]{.mark} second [global

[19-member European Commission presented ideas [to strengthen Euro's
role as an international currency]{.mark}.]{.underline} According to the
Commission, the efforts and initiatives in this regard would provide
protection to its citizens and businesses and promote interests in
formulating global affairs based on multilateralism and cooperation
amongst different governments. Source: European Commission [It is also
believed that [having more than one international currency would reduce
the susceptibility of economies]{.mark} across the world to disruptions
and shocks linked to the strong reliance of many sectors on a single
currency.]{.underline} In recent months, [[Washington has flexed its
muscle by using the global role of the dollar]{.mark} to impose powerful
sanctions on companies doing business with Iran. With the so called
extra-territorial impositions by the US, the European companies find it
difficult to sustain trade ties with other countries, specifically Iran,
and a significant portion of [Iran's international trade is billed in US
dollars]{.mark}.]{.underline} Thus, European Union seeks to safeguard
its interest and reflect its political, economic and financial weight.

[The [[U.S. dollar](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=.DXY) is the
dominant currency in oil trading]{.mark}, [but [Saudi
Arabia](https://www.cnbc.com/saudi-arabia/)]{.mark} [is]{.mark}
reportedly [considering]{.mark} [selling]{.mark} its crude [in other
currencies if American lawmakers pass an anti-OPEC

that [[Riyadh is preparing a strategy]{.mark} [to deal with]{.mark}
potential passage of the [No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels
Act](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/08/a-bill-to-hobble-opec-is-advancing-in-congress.html),
known as [NOPEC]{.mark}.]{.underline} The legislation is [widely viewed
as a
longshot](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/13/opec-long-a-villain-in-americas-eyes-is-trying-to-flip-the-script.html),
which means the Saudi move to marginalize the dollar is unlikely to come
to pass. Still, [the [kingdom has discussed the proposal with
other]{.underline} ]{.mark}[[OPEC](https://www.cnbc.com/opec/)
[members]{.mark}]{.underline}, two sources told Reuters. Another source
said Riyadh has broached the subject with U.S. energy officials. If the
Saudis followed through, it would chip away at U.S. influence over
global financial markets and Washington's ability to enforce sanctions
on foreign entities. Efforts to diminish the greenback's role in oil
trading have been fairly limited to date, but the Saudi plan would lend
significant momentum to those efforts --- and represent a coup for
countries like Russia and China. [[Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [is the world's
largest oil exporter]{.mark}, and its total crude output is surpassed
only by U.S. and Russian production. It pumps enough oil to meet about
[10 percent of global demand]{.mark}, while OPEC fulfills about a third
of global consumption.]{.underline} ["[The Saudis know they have **the
dollar as the nuclear option**,]{.underline}"]{.mark} one of the sources
told Reuters. The Saudi embassy in Washington did not immediately return
CNBC's request for comment. The Saudi energy ministry and U.S.
Department of Energy did not respond to Reuters. The State Department
told Reuters it does not comment on pending legislation. [The
[NOPEC]{.mark} legislation would amend existing U.S. law, allowing the
Justice Department to sue foreign countries for working together to
limit oil supplies and influence prices. That [represents an existential
threat to OPEC]{.mark}.]{.underline} The 14-nation producer group
regulates global oil supply by setting output limits for each member
during times of oversupply. Capping output pushes up the cost of crude.
Since OPEC nations depend on oil revenues to balance their budgets, the
line between balancing the market and filling domestic coffers has
always been blurry. [OPEC and a group of non-member allies led by Russia
are currently trying to keep 1.2 million barrels a day off the market
through the first half of 2018.]{.underline} While some stakeholders ---
including many U.S. drillers --- believe OPEC is essential to keeping
supply and demand in balance, others say the group inflates prices to
enrich its members at the expense of oil consumers. [That latter view is
popular with both Democratic and Republican lawmakers, who want to keep
energy prices low for their constituents.]{.underline} "For decades[,
[Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [has benefited from trading]{.mark} its vast
supplies of cheap [oil on an unfree market dominated by the OPEC
cartel]{.mark}---[at American expense]{.mark}]{.underline}," said Robbie
Diamond, president and CEO of Securing America's Future Energy, a think
tank that advocates for reducing U.S. dependence on oil. "This report,
if true, would only further prove that Saudi Arabia is willing to go to
extreme lengths to protect its unfair advantage in the global oil
market," Diamond said in a statement.

### Free Trade

Yuan]{.mark} [has]{.mark} been closely [pegged to the US dollar for
several years.]{.mark}]{.underline} This has allowed Chinese goods to be
sold at relatively stable prices. [The [rise of]{.mark} the [Euro has

dollar]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[China, Russia, India and Brazil]{.mark}
have made it clear that they would [prefer to transact]{.mark} mutual
trade and investment [in their own currencies]{.mark}.]{.underline}
China has introduced a Yuan denominated oil futures contract which has
captured 7% of global volume. Since 2014 international access to stocks
traded via the stock connect between Hong Kong and Shanghai has opened
the Chinese market to additional foreign capital. The Shenzen stock
exchange followed in 2016. Even developed nations, including the UK,
France and Germany, have been spurred on (in particular, by the US
imposition of sanctions against Iran, which they did not support) to
fine tune their non-dollar payments processes. How Rapidly Could the
Dollar Decline? There is still a long way to go. Prior to its launch in
1999 the currencies which now comprise the Euro accounted for around 18%
of global reserves; those reserves rose marginally until 2003. Today
combined Euro reserves are just over 20%. This chart shows the waxing
and waning of US reserves between 1965 and 2018. The recent low-point
was 46% in 1991, this was a response to the original collapse of the
Bretton Woods agreement. Interestingly the rebound began with the
outbreak of the Gulf War: [**[The greatest risk to the US
dollar]{.mark}** may, in fact, [come from within]{.mark}. [The
imposition of tariffs and sanctions create]{.mark} an
[opportunity]{.mark} [for other countries to]{.mark} engage in bilateral
[trade]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[The decision to withdraw from the free
trade initiatives]{.mark} such as the TPP]{.underline} [and T-TIP

the preeminent [position of the]{.mark} [US dollar]{.mark}.]{.underline}

China turned inward, spurred on by civil unrest due to a series of bad
harvests. [[China's xenophobic decision]{.mark}, that the rest of the
world had nothing to offer, [created]{.mark} an [opportunity for

the new world order can be charted from this point. Markets abhor a
vacuum. [[If the US turns its back]{.mark} on the world, [the world will

The foundation of American hegemony might appear to rest on its
military. But, in fact, [the true source of American power is based on
its currency: The U.S. dollar.]{.underline} For dollar hegemony allows
the U.S. to borrow unlimited amounts of money from the rest of the
world. [Ending this dominance would cut off credit to the United States
and place the cost of American defense spending, and other major
government programs squarely on the shoulders of the American
voter]{.underline}. This would likely lead to a drastic reprioritization
of government spending priorities. [There are [four interlocking pieces
to]{.mark} this [monetary hegemony]{.mark}]{.underline}: (1) The ability
to force other countries and companies around the world to denominate
their trade in dollars, (2) controlling access to the global payments
system, (3) the primacy of the dollar as a global reserve currency and,
perhaps most important, (4) the nature of the dollar as a fiat currency.
[These [are all currently under threat]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [[in a
world where changes occurs at faster]{.underline}]{.mark} and faster
[[rates]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[the demise of the dollar
may]{.underline}]{.mark} play out [[not in decades]{.underline}]{.mark},
as many assume, [[but]{.mark}]{.underline} perhaps [[over just a few
short years]{.underline}]{.mark}. Recent [developments suggest that
[this process is well under way]{.mark}]{.underline}. The dollar as a
unit of account. By forcing other to price goods and services in
dollars, the U.S. creates demand for its currency. This requires buyers
to find ways to earn dollars to pay for their purchases. However,
[[because the dollar is a fiat currency]{.underline}]{.mark} (more on
this below), [[the U.S. can create dollars literally out of thin
air]{.mark} without providing anything of value in exchange for a new
batch]{.underline} (or boatload) [of dollars]{.underline}. As American
economist Barry Eichengreen noted \"[[It costs only a few cents]{.mark}
for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to produce a 100 dollars\'
bill, [but other countries had to pony up 100 dollars\' of]{.mark}
actual [goods]{.mark} in order [to obtain one]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}
This part of dollar hegemony was cemented into place in the 1970s when
Saudi Arabia agreed to price oil in dollars in exchange for American
military protection (and use those dollars to purchase U.S. government
securities). However, [[recent developments]{.mark} including the launch
of Shanghai oil futures, which are denominated in Renminbi (RMB), [offer
an alternative]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[China is already the world\'s top
importer of oil]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[With]{.mark} the [recent]{.mark}
upgrading of [China-Russia relations]{.mark} which includes trade in oil
priced in RMB, [the emergence of another currency]{.mark} as a global
unit of account [has been firmly established]{.mark}.]{.underline} U.S.

The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Communications (SWIFT)
financial messaging service is the primary means to transfer money
globally. Based in Belgium, the member-owned cooperative connects more
than 11,000 banks, financial institutions and corporations in more than
200 countries and territories around the world. It serves as the central
nervous system of global finance. So, if a country\'s banks are cut off
from SWIFT it cannot pay for imports or receive payments for exports.
But while SWIFT might look like an independent multi-national
organization, appearances can be deceiving. [In fact, the [U.S.]{.mark}
through [threats of sanctions]{.mark} against SWIFT\'s board of
directors can force it to [disconnect those who displease
Washington]{.mark} and it is in fact [a crucial tool for maintaining
American dollar hegemony]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, on June 28,
[[France, Germany and the UK]{.mark} [announced]{.mark} that [an
alternative payment system]{.mark} called Instex became
operational.]{.underline} This payment balancing system permits
companies in Europe to buy Iranian goods, and vice-versa, without
accessing SWIFT. [[Given the]{.mark} growing number of
[countries]{.mark} which [the U.S.]{.mark} [has threatened]{.mark} with
economic aggression including China, Iran, Russia, Venezuela and others,
[the desire for an alternative payment system is
undeniable]{.mark}.]{.underline} The U.S. Treasury Department\'s
undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Sigal
Mandelker, warned Instex President Per Fischer, in a May letter, \"I
urge you to carefully consider the potential sanctions exposure of
Instex. Engaging in activities that run afoul of U.S. sanctions can
result in severe consequences, including a loss of access to the U.S.
financial system.\" However the timing of the June 28 announcement may
signal that a big enough coalition of countries exists to counter or
deter American threats against Instex. Moreover, its backers may believe
that retaliation by the U.S. will spur even faster adoption of an
alternative to SWIFT. A Pakistani currency dealer counts Chinese

Photo. The dollar two-step: A fiat currency becomes the global reserve
currency. Before August 13, 1971 the U.S. dollar was backed by
gold-meaning that a dollar could be converted into a certain amount of
gold, a physical commodity with real value. However on that fateful day,
President Nixon declared that dollars could no longer be exchanged for
gold or any other reserve asset and turned the dollar in fiat money
(meaning a currency with no intrinsic value). But to sustain global
demand for the dollar, the U.S. also reached an agreement in the 1970s
whereby Saudi Arabia would only accept payment for oil in dollars
irrespective of whom or where the buyer was. With oil being the world\'s
most valuable commodity, this ensured that countries everywhere would
need to secure dollars to both settle oil purchases and hedge against
oil price changes and to manage the value of their own currencies. As
noted above, this allowed the U.S. to enforce the dollar as a global
unit of account. Combined with the ability to print money, this provided
the fuel for unlimited spending and American hegemony. Launched in 2018,
Shanghai oil futures are not only priced in RMB but can also be
converted into gold. A currency backed by a valuable physical commodity
may have much great appeal than one without intrinsic value like the
dollar. Not surprisingly, trading volume for these futures has exploded.
Moreover, more and more central banks are increasing their holdings of
gold instead of dollars, which is reducing the importance of the dollar
as a global reserve currency. Countdown to the demise of dollar
hegemony. Both those the U.S. deems adversaries such as [I[ran]{.mark},
and [Russia]{.mark} as well as ostensible allies like [France, Germany
and the UK]{.mark} [have]{.mark} increasingly compelling and urgent
[reasons to circumvent dollar heg]{.mark}emony]{.underline}. While
appearing unassailable, [the dollar may be much more vulnerable than
many suspects]{.underline}. The reporting by some well-known western
business media outlets only reinforces these erroneous perceptions since
those doing the reporting seem to not have a sufficient grasp of the
underlying accounting and economic principles underpinning dollar
hegemony. Events described above demonstrate that [[the countdown to the
demise]{.mark} of dollar hegemony [has begun]{.mark}]{.underline}. Given
the accelerating pace of technological, social and political change,
[[its end may]{.mark} be [arrive]{.mark}s [sooner than
expected]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

#### The petrodollar collapse is in no ones interest

**Adams 16** Cecil adams is a writer for the Washington city paper. \"Is
The Petrodollar About To Tank The Economy?\"
https://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/columns/straight-dope/article/13047527/is-the-petrodollar-about-to-tank-the-economy-a-calmer

How many gallons of water should you stock in the emergency cellar? Will
three AR-15s suffice, or does the well-equipped arsenal really demand
four? If these be your concerns, Kingsley, you'll find a fantastic
resource in the Internet, the petrodollar and the havoc that'll result
from its impending collapse being an extremely popular topic among the
black-helicopter set. You can't go wrong with freeze-dried peas, I hear.
A calmer assessment reveals a more prosaic concept. [What we talk about
when we talk about [petrodollars is international oil sales as
transacted in U.S. dollars]{.mark}]{.underline}---which is to say, oil
sales: the dollar has long been the standard currency for all such
dealings. The primary world reserve currency, meanwhile, is the very
same dollar---full stop. The origins of this arrangement hark back to
Bretton Woods, the 1944 confab of Allied nations where it was decided
that the dollar would be the world's backup buck, backed itself by gold
at a fixed rate of \$35 per ounce. International spending, though---and
it was a spendy era, what with the rebuilding of Europe, the Great
Society, the Vietnam War, etc---promptly grew to dwarf the Fort Knox
reserves, which at one point held only a third of the gold needed to
cover the dollars in foreign circulation, prompting fears of a run on
the place. In 1971 President Richard Nixon suspended the direct
convertibility of the U.S. dollar into gold, bringing about a system of
floating, rather than fixed, exchange rates. Among other things this
move, the so-called Nixon Shock, increased the ability of the Federal
Reserve to influence monetary policy, which in turn, decades later, led
yahoos like Ron Paul and Ted Cruz to pine for a return to the gold
standard. (Most economists continue to see this as a pretty bad idea.)
But the key development of the era, for our purposes, was a deal where,
in exchange for U.S. military support and other preferential treatment,
the Saudis agreed to conduct oil transactions in dollars only. Soon OPEC
as a whole signed on. As prices shot up in the '70s, oil-exporting
countries in the Middle East found themselves with more dollars than
they knew what to do with; they placed them in U.S. and British banks,
which in turn used the dollars to make loans to developing countries
that needed the money to . . . import oil, the resulting relationship of
indebtedness a boon to U.S. global hegemony. Sound a bit Kissingerian?
Well, the whole thing was Henry's baby: he called the scheme "recycling
petrodollars." ("Petrodollars" as opposed to, say, "dollars" because
they don't circulate in the U.S.; economists thought it'd be useful to
make the distinction.) Conveniently, the Saudis also used their
petrodollar surpluses to buy munitions from American arms manufacturers,
who, with Vietnam winding down, were grateful for the business. All
around, a shining example of U.S. foreign policy: we enrich ourselves
and impoverish the developing world while selling weapons to jerks.
Doffing your tinfoil hat, then, you come to see the petrodollar bathed
in the glow of '70s and '80s nostalgia, like disco and Oliver North.
What relevance does it have nowadays? Well, to hear the, er, more
concerned parties tell it, if the oil-producing countries decide to stop
using the dollar for oil transactions---switching to, say, the
euro---it'll send the world economy into a tailspin. There *has* been a
little attrition, most notably in 2000 when the United Nations' "oil for
food" program gave Iraq permission to sell its oil for euros; hardcore
skeptics cite this threat to the rule of the petrodollar as a
contributing factor in the U.S. invasion. Since then Iran has switched
to conducting its oil transactions in euros, and recently Gazprom Neft,
Russia's third-largest oil producer, began selling oil to China in
exchange for renminbi. [But [an abrupt abandonment of the petrodollar
system is in nobody's best interest]{.mark}: since most major nations
continue to back their own currency with the U.S. dollar, everybody's
got some skin in the game vis-à-vis keeping that currency stable. That's
not to say the petrodollar regime isn't a bit sensitive these
days]{.underline}, [[but it's for]{.mark} another reason:
[fracking]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Environmental implications
aside, hydraulic fracturing (discussed here in 2013) has put major shale
oil reserves in play and (for now, at least) upended the world energy
market. In 2011, for instance, the U.S. imported about \$360 billion
worth of oil; by 2015, that number had dropped to \$120 billion. One
estimate last year pegged OPEC's 2015 profits at \$350 billion lower
than those in 2014---the largest year-over-year drop ever. Oil
gazillionaires who spent the commodity-boom aughts buying up Manhattan
penthouses are now rapidly burning through their petrodollar savings; if
the trend continues, *Bloomberg* suggested, demand will fall for
"everything from European government debt to U.S. real estate." Not
nothing, in other words, but neither is it global collapse.

## Arm Sales Not Key

#### Arms sales are not key \-- tariffs and trade wars are

**Hatfield 18** (Matthew Hatfield, Journalist at Harvard Political
Review, \"The Worrisome Deal: China and Saudi Arabia\", 12/18/18,
https://harvardpolitics.com/world/the-worrisome-deal-china-and-saudi-arabia/)

The prospective decline of American power through the destabilization of
the petrodollar could disrupt a balance of power that has ensured
relative world peace since the Cold War. [A weak US economy would leave
the nation with a weaker and drive a new dual-hegemony between Russia
and China]{.underline}, who signed an Eurasian Economic Cooperation pact
on May 17th in Astana. [As Russia continues to "heat" Europe through its
natural gas reserves]{.underline}, [which are not sold via the dollar,
[taking global energy off the dollar -- by taking it off of oil
altogether -- is a future possibility]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In the last few months, the United States' reaction to the Chinese-Saudi
Arabia negotiations have been rather quiet with little report to no
media attention . With President Trump's continued rhetoric and talk[,
[it is clear that tariffs and a trade war will be of continual
focus]{.mark}]{.underline}, at least much more relative [[to the
possible attack at the petrodollar]{.underline}]{.mark}, and indirectly,
at inflation in the United States
