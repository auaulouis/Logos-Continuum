#### A. Uniqueness & link -- Strong Saudi-US relations key to Middle East strategy and containing Iranian threat -- reducing arms sales undermines US commitment

**Cordesman, Arleigh A. Burke chair in strategy at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, 18**

\[Anthony, 3-22-18, Center for Strategic & International Studies, "Saudi
Arabia is a Critical American Security Partner in the Middle East",
<https://www.csis.org/analysis/saudi-arabia-critical-american-security-partner-middle-east>,
accessed 6-19-19, AFB\]

[Somewhere along the line, we seem to have forgotten that our strategy
in the Middle East is dependent on Saudi Arabia as our most important
single security partner. Israel's security]{.underline} is certainly a
key American concern, but it [does not play an active role in most of
America's ongoing military engagements in the region, in dealing with
Iran, or in a direct fight against violent extremist movements like ISIS
and Al Qaeda.]{.underline}

Saudi Arabia's role as a strategic partner has also been enhanced by the
fact that Egypt and Algeria are focused on their own internal stability,
and their roles in the region have sharply diminished, and Iraq and
Syria both must deal with major instability problems and are at war. Our
European allies have declining power projection capabilities, and
Turkey's role in the region is increasingly problematic.

[It is certainly true that Saudi Arabia needs the United States as much
or more than the United States needs Saudi Arabia. Saudi military forces
are steadily improving, but it is the U.S. presence in the region that
creates a balance of forces that firmly deters Iran and has helped Saudi
Arabia defeat its own terrorist threats from groups like Al Qaeda in the
Arabian Peninsula.]{.underline} [U.S. arms shipments, advisory efforts
and exercises also play a critical role in improving Saudi
forces.]{.underline}

[But the United States needs Saudi Arabia as well. Saudi Arabia is now
the most critical single security partner in ensuring the stable flow of
petroleum out of the Gulf region. While the United States is largely
eliminating its need for direct petroleum imports, it is steadily
increasing its dependence on the health and growth of the global economy
and imports from Asian states like China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan,
which are critically dependent on Gulf petroleum exports. The end result
is that U.S. strategic interests in the region continue to
increase]{.underline} in spite of the steady cut in U.S. direct oil
imports.

This is why focusing on more U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia and Saudi
investment in the United States, ignoring the growing role Saudi Arabia
has played in fight terrorism since 2003, downplaying the need to
cooperate in checking Iran, and treating the war in Yemen as is if Saudi
Arabia does not face real threats, is not the way the United States
should deal with Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman's visit to the White
House.

Saudi Arabia's reform and economic development plans are critical to its
stability and the region's security. The Kingdom needs U.S.
encouragement and an understanding that Saudi Arabia cannot implement
these plans effectively without outside support. The burden sharing
argument has become absurd. Saudi Arabia cannot be treated as a source
of ready money every time the United States has a need.

Saudi Arabia is already spending more than 10 percent of its economy on
security, which is at least three times the economic burden on the GDP
that security spending places on the United States. This spending is too
high given the Kingdom's other needs, and the United States should be
focusing on better ways to make its security partnerships with Saudi
Arabia, as well as the other Gulf states and Jordan more efficient and
less costly, not simply on getting Saudi Arabia to spend more.

At the same time, [Iran is all too real a threat. Effective joint action
in dealing with Iran's nuclear programs, its ballistic and cruise
missile programs, its asymmetric threats to Gulf shipping, and expending
military influence in the region are all critical common U.S. and Saudi
priorities]{.underline}.

[The United States also badly needs to find some common approach to
dealing with Iraq and Syria that will move both towards recovery and
lasting stability, limit Iranian and Russian influence as much as
possible, and help stabilize relations with Turkey. There are no easy
options in either case, but Saudi Arabia is the key potential Arab
partner any such efforts.]{.underline}

The United States, especially members of Congress, need to remember that
we have had at least as many military problems in fighting the Iraq and
Syria wars as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have faced in
fighting in Yemen. [Cutting U.S. arms shipments to Saudi Arabia may do
little more that lead the Saudis to ignore the systems that the United
States has helped set up to limit targeting of civilians and using
unguided and more damaging air munitions. It raises a whole new round of
questions about the U.S commitment to its partners in the
region.]{.underline}

#### B. Impacts

#### 1. War with Iran would shatter the global economy and risk cascading nuclear proliferation

**Wilson, Ploughshares research associate, 6-14-19**

\[Geoff Wilson is a Research Associate at Ploughshares Fund, a global
security foundation. He has authored articles for The Huffington Post,
Defense One and War on the Rocks., 6-14-19, (This originally appeared at
War is Boring in 2018.), National Interest, "A U.S.-Iran War Would Be
All Sorts of Awful",
<https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/us-iran-war-would-be-all-sorts-awful-62537>,
accessed 6-20-19, AFB\]

While many conservatives are quick to spurn negotiations with Iran,
[they seem to have done very little in the way of analyzing what a war
with Iran would actually look like. Maybe they need a
reminder]{.underline}.

[It would neither be quick nor painless. As former Brookings Institution
fellow Noah Shachtman described in 2012, it would be a major major
military action, with little chance of lasting success.]{.underline}

"Setting back Iran's nuclear efforts will need to be an all-out effort,
with squadrons of bombers and fighter jets, teams of commandos, rings of
interceptor missiles and whole Navy carrier strike groups --- plus
enough drones, surveillance gear, tanker aircraft and logistical support
to make such a massive mission go. And all of it, at best, would buy the
U.S. and Israel another decade of a nuke-free Iran."

[Even a limited strike by U.S. air and naval forces would be massive,
according to Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies.]{.underline}

"It is not a simple mission of bombers flying in and out of Iran, this
is a complicated Offensive Air Strike that will involve many aircraft,
each with its own role, such as Combat Aircarft \[sic\] whose role is to
suppress enemy air defenses along the way, aircraft that fly fighter
escort with the bombers, aircraft that carry specialized electronic
warfare equipment to jam enemy radars and communications., plus probably
air-to-air refueling along the way in and out of Iran."

Even then, Cordesman added, "depending on the forces allocated and
duration of air strikes, it is unlikely that an air campaign alone could
alone terminate Iran's program. The possibility of dispersed facilities
complicates any assessment of a potential mission success, making it
unclear what the ultimate effect of a strike would be on Iran's nuclear
facilities."

Further complicating matters, [U.S. military forces would not be able to
simply focus on striking Iranian nuclear targets. They would also have
to safeguard the Strait of Hormuz --- a narrow waterway connecting the
Gulf of Oman to the Persian Gulf --- through which some 20 percent of
the world's oil passes, as well as countless other U.S. and allied
strategic assets in the area.]{.underline}

[Indeed, even a temporary closure of the strait through Iranian
deployment of mines, mini-subs, shore-to-ship missile batteries and
patrol boats could have a serious effect upon the world
economy]{.underline}.

[The Federation of American Scientists estimates that the "the rough
effects of U.S. \[military\] action against Iran on the global economy
--- measured only in the first three months of actualization ---
\[could\] range from total losses of approximately \$60 billion on one
end of the scale to more than \$2 trillion to the world economy on the
other end."]{.underline}

All in all, [a U.S.]{.underline} or coalition [attack against Iran now
would be like setting off a bomb in a gunpowder factory. As Cordesman
noted, any "military strike \[against Iran\] could be destabilizing for
the entire Middle East region and potentially generate a nuclear weapons
race in that part of the world."]{.underline}

War with Iran is no joke. Critics of a deal with Iran should not treat
it like one. A breakdown in negotiations will have serious repercussions
for the Middle East and U.S. foreign policy. That being the case,
lawmakers should be more careful when threatening to use U.S. military
force.

[The enormous costs involved in engaging U.S. forces against Iran, both
human and materiel, should not be bandied about lightly.]{.underline}

#### 2. Proliferation causes nuclear war -- accidents, adventurism, and preemptive strikes

**Kroenig, Georgetown School of Foreign Service Assistant Professor and
International Relations Field Chair, 15**

\[Matthew, Journal of Strategic Studies, Vol 38, No 1-2, "The History of
Proliferation Optimism: Does It Have a Future?" , p. 98-125, accessed
6-20-19, TandFOnline, AFB\]

The spread of nuclear weapons poses at least six severe threats to
international peace and security including: nuclear war, nuclear
terrorism, global and regional instability, constrained US freedom of
action, weakened alliances, and further nuclear proliferation. Each of
these threats has received extensive treatment elsewhere and this review
is not intended to replicate or even necessarily to improve upon these
previous efforts. Rather the goals of this section are more modest: to
usefully bring together and recap the many reasons why [we should be
pessimistic about the likely consequences of nuclear
proliferation]{.underline}. Many of these threats will be illuminated
with a discussion of a case of much contemporary concern: Iran's
advanced nuclear program.

Nuclear War

[The greatest threat posed by the spread of nuclear weapons is nuclear
war. The more states in possession of nuclear weapons, the greater the
probability that somewhere, someday, there will be a catastrophic
nuclear war.]{.underline}

To date, nuclear weapons have only been used in warfare once. In 1945,
the United States used nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
bringing World War II to a close. Many analysts point to the
65-plus-year tradition of nuclear non-use as evidence that nuclear
weapons are unusable, but it would be naïve to think that nuclear
weapons will never be used again simply because they have not been used
for some time. After all, analysts in the 1990s argued that worldwide
economic downturns like the Great Depression were a thing of the past,
only to be surprised by the dot-com bubble bursting later in the decade
and the Great Recession of the late 2000s.48 This author, for one, would
be surprised if nuclear weapons are not used again sometime in his
lifetime.

[Before reaching a state of MAD, new nuclear states go through a
transition period in which they lack a secure-second strike capability.
In this context, one or both states might believe that it has an
incentive to use nuclear weapons first.]{.underline} For example, if
Iran acquires nuclear weapons, neither Iran, nor its nuclear-armed
rival, Israel, will have a secure, second-strike capability. Even though
it is believed to have a large arsenal, [given its small size and lack
of strategic depth, Israel might not be confident that it could absorb a
nuclear strike and respond with a devastating counterstrike. Similarly,
Iran might eventually be able to build a large and survivable nuclear
arsenal, but, when it first crosses the nuclear threshold, Tehran will
have a small and vulnerable nuclear force.]{.underline}

\]In these pre-MAD situations, there are at least three ways that
nuclear war could occur. First, [the state with the nuclear advantage
might believe it has a splendid first strike capability. In a crisis,
Israel might, therefore, decide to launch a preventive nuclear strike to
disarm Iran's nuclear capabilities. Indeed, this incentive might be
further increased by Israel's aggressive strategic culture that
emphasizes preemptive action. Second, the state with a small and
vulnerable nuclear arsenal, in this case Iran, might feel use them or
lose them pressures. That is, in a crisis, Iran might decide to strike
first rather than risk having its entire nuclear arsenal destroyed.
Third, as Thomas Schelling has argued, nuclear war could result due to
the reciprocal fear of surprise attack.49 If there are advantages to
striking first, one state might start a nuclear war in the belief that
war is inevitable and that it would be better to go first than to go
second.]{.underline} Fortunately, there is no historic evidence of this
dynamic occurring in a nuclear context, but it is still possible. In an
Israeli--Iranian crisis, for example, Israel and Iran might both prefer
to avoid a nuclear war, but decide to strike first rather than suffer a
devastating first attack from an opponent.

Even in a world of MAD, however, when both sides have secure,
second-strike capabilities, **[there is still a risk of nuclear
war]{.underline}**. Rational deterrence theory assumes nuclear-armed
states are governed by rational leaders who would not intentionally
launch a suicidal nuclear war. This assumption appears to have applied
to past and current nuclear powers, but there is no guarantee that it
will continue to hold in the future. [Iran's theocratic
government,]{.underline} despite its inflammatory rhetoric, has followed
a fairly pragmatic foreign policy since 1979, but it contains leaders
who hold millenarian religious worldviews and could one day ascend to
power. We cannot rule out the possibility that, as nuclear weapons
continue to spread, some leader somewhere will choose to launch a
nuclear war, knowing full well that it could result in self-destruction.

One does not need to resort to irrationality, however, to imagine
nuclear war under MAD. Nuclear weapons may deter leaders from
intentionally launching full-scale wars, but they do not mean the end of
international politics. As was discussed above[, nuclear-armed states
still have conflicts of interest and leaders still seek to coerce
nuclear-armed adversaries.]{.underline} Leaders might, therefore, choose
to launch a limited nuclear war.50 This strategy might be especially
attractive to states in a position of conventional inferiority that
might have an incentive to escalate a crisis quickly to the nuclear
level. During the Cold War, the United States planned to use nuclear
weapons first to stop a Soviet invasion of Western Europe given NATO's
conventional inferiority.51 As Russia's conventional power has
deteriorated since the end of the Cold War, Moscow has come to rely more
heavily on nuclear weapons in its military doctrine. Indeed, Russian
strategy calls for the use of nuclear weapons early in a conflict
(something that most Western strategists would consider to be
escalatory) as a way to de-escalate a crisis. Similarly, Pakistan's
military plans for nuclear use in the event of an invasion from
conventionally stronger India. And finally, Chinese generals openly talk
about the possibility of nuclear use against a US superpower in a
possible East Asia contingency. Second, as was also discussed above,
[leaders can make a 'threat that leaves something to chance'.52 They can
initiate a nuclear crisis. By playing these risky games]{.underline} of
nuclear brinkmanship, [states can increase the risk of nuclear war in an
attempt to force a less resolved adversary to back down. Historical
crises have not resulted in nuclear war, but many of them,]{.underline}
including the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, [have come close.]{.underline}
And scholars have documented historical incidents when accidents nearly
led to war.53 [When we think about future nuclear crisis dyads,
such]{.underline} as Iran and Israel, [with fewer sources of stability
than existed during the Cold War, we can see that there is a real risk
that a future crisis could result in a devastating nuclear
exchange.]{.underline}

[Nuclear Terrorism]{.underline}

[The spread of nuclear weapons also increases the risk of nuclear
terrorism.]{.underline}54 While September 11th was one of the greatest
tragedies in American history, it would have been much worse had Osama
Bin Laden possessed nuclear weapons. [Bin Laden declared it a 'religious
duty' for Al- Qa'eda to acquire nuclear weapons and radical clerics have
issued fatwas declaring it permissible to use nuclear weapons in Jihad
against the West.55 Unlike states, which can be more easily deterred,
there is little doubt that if terrorists acquired nuclear weapons, they
would use them.56]{.underline} Indeed, in recent years, many US
politicians and security analysts have argued that nuclear terrorism
poses the greatest threat to US national security.57

[Analysts have pointed out the tremendous hurdles that terrorists would
have to overcome in order to acquire nuclear weapons.58 Nevertheless, as
nuclear weapons spread, the possibility that they will eventually fall
into terrorist hands increases. States could intentionally transfer
nuclear weapons, or the fissile material required to build them, to
terrorist groups. There are good reasons why a state might be reluctant
to transfer nuclear weapons to terrorists, but, as nuclear weapons
spread, the probability that a leader might someday purposely arm a
terrorist group increases.]{.underline} Some fear, for example, that
Iran, with its close ties to Hamas and Hizballah, might be at a
heightened risk of transferring nuclear weapons to terrorists. Moreover,
even if no state would ever intentionally transfer nuclear capabilities
to terrorists, [a new nuclear state, with underdeveloped security
procedures, might be vulnerable to theft, allowing terrorist groups or
corrupt or ideologically-motivated insiders to transfer dangerous
material to terrorists.]{.underline} There is evidence, for example,
that representatives from Pakistan's atomic energy establishment met
with Al-Qa'eda members to discuss a possible nuclear deal.59

[Finally, a nuclear-armed state could collapse, resulting in a breakdown
of law and order and a loose nukes problem.]{.underline} US officials
are currently very concerned about what would happen to Pakistan's
nuclear weapons if the government were to fall. As nuclear weapons
spread, this problem is only further amplified. Iran is a country with a
history of revolutions and a government with a tenuous hold on power.
The regime change that Washington has long dreamed about in Tehran could
actually become a nightmare if a nuclear-armed Iran suffered a breakdown
in authority, forcing us to worry about the fate of Iran's nuclear
arsenal.

[Regional Instability]{.underline}

[The spread of nuclear weapons also emboldens nuclear powers,
contributing to regional instability. States that lack nuclear weapons
need to fear direct military attack from other states, but states with
nuclear weapons can be confident that they can deter an intentional
military attack, giving them an incentive to be more aggressive in the
conduct of their foreign policy. In this way, nuclear weapons provide a
shield under which states can feel free to engage in lower-level
aggression.]{.underline} Indeed, international relations theories about
the 'stability-instability paradox' maintain that stability at the
nuclear level contributes to conventional instability.60

[Historically,]{.underline} we have seen that [the spread of nuclear
weapons has emboldened their possessors and contributed to regional
instability. Recent scholarly analyses have demonstrated that, after
controlling for other relevant factors, nuclear-weapon states are more
likely to engage in conflict than nonnuclear-weapon states and that this
aggressiveness is more pronounced in new nuclear states that have less
experience with nuclear diplomacy.]{.underline}61 Similarly, research on
internal decision-making in Pakistan reveals that Pakistani foreign
policymakers may have been emboldened by the acquisition of nuclear
weapons, which encouraged them to initiate militarized disputes against
India.62

Currently, Iran restrains its foreign policy because it fears major
military retaliation from the United States or Israel, but with nuclear
weapons it could feel free to push harder. [A nuclear-armed Iran would
likely step up support to terrorist and proxy groups and engage in more
aggressive coercive diplomacy.]{.underline} [With a nuclear-armed Iran
increasingly throwing its weight around in the region, we could witness
an even more crisis prone Middle East. And in a poly-nuclear Middle
East]{.underline} with Israel, Iran, and, in the future, possibly other
states, armed with nuclear weapons, [any one of those crises could
result in a catastrophic nuclear exchange.]{.underline}

### Uniqueness

#### Saudi Arabia Accounts for nearly twenty percent of US arms sales

Irina **Ivanova**, 10-12-**2018**, \"Saudi Arabia is America\'s No. 1
weapons customer,\" CBS News,
<https://www.cbsnews.com/news/saudi-arabia-is-the-top-buyer-of-u-s-weapons/>
(JSewpersaud)

[The U.S. remains the world\'s largest weapons exporter]{.underline}, a
position it has held since the late 1990s. [Our biggest customer? Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}. That business reality came to the forefront this
week in President Donald Trump\'s refusal to [crack
down](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-saudi-arabia-jamal-khashoggi-us-arms-sales-alleged-assassination/)
on the kingdom whose royal rulers have been accused of murdering a
Saudi-born, U.S.-based dissident journalist who disappeared after
entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. [The U.S. sold a total of
\$55.6 billion of weapons]{.underline} worldwide in the fiscal year that
ended Sept. 30 --- up 33 percent from the previous fiscal year, and a
near record. [In 2017, the U.S. cleared some \$18 billion in new Saudi
arms deals]{.underline}. Mr. Trump has dismissed the idea of suspending
weapons sales to Saudi Arabia to punish its crown prince, Mohammad bin
Salman, for any involvement in the alleged murder of journalist Jamal
Khashoggi. \"I don\'t like the concept of stopping an investment of
\$110 billion into the United States,\" Mr. Trump said this week. Last
year in May, President Trump used his first foreign trip as an occasion
to visit the kingdom and sign an arms deal advertised as [\$110
billion](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-signs-110-billion-arms-deal-with-saudi-arabia/)
--- a figure experts have since disputed as inflated, since it was not
based on actual, signed contracts and included at least \$23 billion
previously approved by the Obama administration, according to [Defense
One](https://www.defenseone.com/business/2017/05/what-really-matters-trumps-110b-saudi-arms-package/138069/).
But even before that announcement, Saudi Arabia was by far the U.S.\'
largest arms client, according to the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute. [Over the five years ending in 2017, nearly
one-fifth of American weapons exports went to Saudi Arabia]{.underline},
SIPRI reports. Overall, half went to the Middle East and North Africa.
In the 2017 calendar year alone, some \$18 billion in new Saudi arms
deals were cleared by the U.S.

### Link and Internal Link

#### Arms Sales to Saudi Arabia bolster US defense and strengthen the Middle East -- crucial for energy stability

Anthony **Cordesman**, 9-24-**2010**, \"Is Big Saudi Arms Sale a Good
Idea?,\" Council on Foreign Relations,
<https://www.cfr.org/expert-roundup/big-saudi-arms-sale-good-idea>
(JSewpersaud)

[The United States shares critical strategic interests with Saudi Arabia
that shape the proposed Saudi arms sale]{.underline}. First, for all the
talk of energy independence over the last four decades, the [U.S.
Department of Energy estimates that the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [will be]{.underline} as strategically de[pendent
on imported oil through 2035]{.underline} as it is today. These
projections do not even take account of our indirect imports of oil in
the form of manufactured goods, or our dependence on the health of a
global economy that requires stable supply- and market-driven prices.
[The stability of Gulf energy exports is critical to our economy and
every job in the United States]{.underline} Second, [U.S. military power
is finite, and both the United States and Saudi Arabia face rapidly
changing threats]{.underline}. [The United States needs allies that have
interoperable forces that can both fight effectively alongside the
United States and ease the U.S. burden by defending
themselves]{.underline}. Iran already poses a massive asymmetric
naval-air-assault force threat to the Gulf states. The U.S. invasion of
Iraq has left Iraqi forces a decade away from being a counterbalance to
Iran; Saudi Arabia is the only meaningful regional power to work with.
Additionally, al-Qaeda in the peninsula is based in Yemen, and **[the
threat of terrorism and outside infiltration means highly mobile Saudi
forces are critical to the security of Saudi energy and civil
facilities]{.underline}**. Helping Saudi Arabia create a combination of
effective air and naval power also helps ensure the security of tanker
and other shipping in the Gulf of Oman and a steadily more unstable Red
Sea. Third, [Iran already poses a missile]{.underline} and chemical
weapons [threat]{.underline} and may pose a nuclear one within the next
three to five years. [Upgrades of the Saudi Patriots create a base for
an integrated approach to air and missile defense]{.underline}. They lay
the groundwork for follow-on sales of advanced missile defense systems
[like THAAD, and an emphasis on defense]{.underline} (not Saudi
purchases of missiles or nuclear systems). [Coupled with recent U.S.
offers of \"extended regional deterrence\" and the creation of a Saudi
Air Force]{.underline} that is more of a threat to Iran than Iran's
conventional missiles are to Saudi Arabia, [they offer the best hope of
both giving Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states security]{.underline} and
stopping a nuclear arms race in the region. Fourth, [the proposed arms
sale package creates a level of interdependence that gives]{.underline}
both [the]{.underline} current [Saudi government]{.underline} as well as
Saudi governments for the next fifteen to twenty years [a strong
incentive to work with the United States]{.underline}. [Saudi Arabia
will need continuing support from the United States during the entire
lifecycle of every major system sold, and no future Saudi government can
ignore this fact]{.underline}. Moreover, the sales are large in dollar
terms, but not in terms of numbers of weapons. This will not be some
kind of massive build-up. Saudi Arabia had an air force with some 417
combat aircraft in 2000, and it now has only 219. The Saudi F-15 buy
will not even restore the force to 2000 numbers. It will take some three
to five years to deliver and put fully in service, replace some
eighty-seven obsolete F-5A/Bs and F-5EIIs that were in service in 2000,
and help Saudi Arabia compensate for the serious performance limits on
107 aging Tornados still in service.

facts are generally accepted, but we\'re¶ turning a blind eye and
you\'ll see in the 9/11¶ Commission report that\'s been leaked out to

We just did a story and you were mentioning¶ that article that I believe
Michael Isikoff has in¶ Newsweek, about the FBI covering up a situation
where¶ a Saudi agent was helping some of those hijackers. How¶ extensive
is the support of the terrorists by the¶ Saudis. You mentioned as much
as \$500 million in your¶ book.¶ Baer: It goes beyond that. We were

millions of dollars to an Islamic leader in¶ Tajikistan, to bin Laden,
probably payoff money. But¶ in my book I talk about the fact that every

Saudi financier One of the main Syrians¶ complicit in this had a Saudi
partner. San Diego was¶ set up in a Mosque in El Cajon, was paid for by
the¶ Saudis. We\'re not getting those questions answered. We¶ really
don\'t know how much money is going either¶ directly or indirectly into
bin Laden.¶ Robertson: You know, (Saudi Crown Prince) Abdullah is¶ a
buddy of George Bush, he visits the ranch in¶ Crawford. The Saudi
Ambassador who is the son of¶ Sultan, the defense minister, has absolute
access to¶ the White House, at least he did during the Clintons.¶ How
many other officials, there\'s several other¶ organizations, the
Carlisle Group to name one, that¶ has tremendous ties and they\'re
making millions of¶ dollars off the Saudi connections. What do you do
to¶ stop that when it\'s this internal to the United¶ States?¶ Baer: The
problem is we have a dependence on Saudi¶ Arabia and like any
psychological or physical¶ dependence we have to learn to break it. You
know, and¶ I don\'t care if we cut back our use of oil, if we¶ drill in
Alaska, if we go to hydrogen fuel cells, but¶ that is a corrupt society
which is not even beginning¶ to correct itself.¶ You\'ll see in my book
that the State Department, the¶ CIA basically said, \"Let the Saudis
take care of their¶ own country. It\'s a quaint, antiquated, medieval,¶
country, whatever you want to call it, they\'re really¶ our friends and
they\'ll do the right thing in the¶ end.\" Now we know the Interior
Minister tried to¶ assassinate a dissident in London. That\'s the kind
of¶ person that\'s supposedly protecting our interests.¶ I know I\'m
getting on my hobby horse here, but you¶ know, who recruited those 15
Saudis that were on those¶ airplanes? They were recruited inside
mosques, inside¶ Saudi Arabia and I certainly don\'t know a single name¶
of one of those clerics. Who are these people? I want¶ to know.¶
Robertson: The Wahhabis preach what we would call¶ puritanistic
activities in relation to sex, drinking,¶ etc. You pointed out in your
book that the Saudis are¶ in some cases sex-obsessed and once they get
in¶ airplanes and take off their robes it\'s \'Katie, bar¶ the door.\'
Do the people of Saudi Arabia realize what¶ their leaders do?¶ Baer:
They do, but this is where the money comes in,¶ because the Saudi royal
family go to the radical¶ militant clerics and say, \"Listen, we got
some¶ problems, we\'re trying to clean up the family, but you¶ look the

that used to work for us who in¶ turn worked for the Saudis. He
indicated that (Saudi¶ prince) Bandar had some Ethiopian boys and that
he was¶ into some types of pedophilia. Do you have CIA¶ information

screw up in Iraq?¶ Baer: Well, you know the closest the administration
is¶ coming to tell us the truth, and I\'ll get back to¶ Saudi Arabia on
this, of course, is that Paul¶ Wolfowitz, deputy secretary of Defense,
said that the¶ war was really about Saudi Arabia because we had to¶ pull
our troops out and Saddam was insane, and we¶ couldn\'t leave him in

someone who\'s¶ worked in the Middle East all these years. I think the¶

trust Iran. In getting rid of Saddam we had to¶ disenfranchise 20
percent of the population, they\'re¶ not working. And right now the oil

#### Saudi Arabia Accounts for nearly twenty percent of US arms sales

[The U.S. remains the world\'s largest weapons exporter]{.underline}, a
position it has held since the late 1990s. [Our biggest customer? Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}. That business reality came to the forefront this
week in President Donald Trump\'s refusal to [crack
down](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-saudi-arabia-jamal-khashoggi-us-arms-sales-alleged-assassination/)
on the kingdom whose royal rulers have been accused of murdering a
Saudi-born, U.S.-based dissident journalist who disappeared after
entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. [The U.S. sold a total of
\$55.6 billion of weapons]{.underline} worldwide in the fiscal year that
ended Sept. 30 --- up 33 percent from the previous fiscal year, and a
near record. [In 2017, the U.S. cleared some \$18 billion in new Saudi
arms deals]{.underline}. Mr. Trump has dismissed the idea of suspending
weapons sales to Saudi Arabia to punish its crown prince, Mohammad bin
Salman, for any involvement in the alleged murder of journalist Jamal
Khashoggi. \"I don\'t like the concept of stopping an investment of
\$110 billion into the United States,\" Mr. Trump said this week. Last
year in May, President Trump used his first foreign trip as an occasion
to visit the kingdom and sign an arms deal advertised as [\$110
billion](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-signs-110-billion-arms-deal-with-saudi-arabia/)
--- a figure experts have since disputed as inflated, since it was not
based on actual, signed contracts and included at least \$23 billion
previously approved by the Obama administration, according to [Defense
One](https://www.defenseone.com/business/2017/05/what-really-matters-trumps-110b-saudi-arms-package/138069/).
But even before that announcement, Saudi Arabia was by far the U.S.\'
largest arms client, according to the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute. [Over the five years ending in 2017, nearly
one-fifth of American weapons exports went to Saudi Arabia]{.underline},
SIPRI reports. Overall, half went to the Middle East and North Africa.
In the 2017 calendar year alone, some \$18 billion in new Saudi arms
deals were cleared by the U.S.

WASHINGTON --- [A senior State Department official]{.underline} on
Wednesday [defended the Trump administration's use of an emergency
declaration to push through arms sales to Saudi Arabia]{.underline} and
the United Arab Emirates, telling a hostile House committee that
[holding back the weapons would have offered an opening to commercial
rivals in China]{.underline} and Russia. In a contentious hearing,
lawmakers from both parties pressed [R. Clarke

the assistant secretary of state in the bureau of political-military
affairs, to detail when the administration first developed the plan to
declare an emergency and sell weapons to Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates against Congress's will. [Lawmakers are outraged by the
decision by President Trump]{.underline} and Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo [in late May to use a loophole]{.underline} in the Arms Export
Control Act [to push through more than \$8 billion worth of weapons

bipartisan groups of lawmakers are already moving to block the sales,
many of which Democrats had informally held up since last year. Members
of the House Foreign Affairs Committee asked whether the emergency
declaration was being discussed within the administration when Mr.
Pompeo and Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan briefed legislators
in a closed-door meeting on threats posed by Iran, which took place
three days before Mr. Trump declared the emergency on May 24. During
that briefing, lawmakers "did not hear a single word about an emergency
or a plan to move ahead with this sale," said Representative Eliot L.
Engel, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs
Committee. "It's a slap in the face." [Mr. Cooper]{.underline}
repeatedly declined to discuss what he called the "predecision" timeline
of events but testified that the move came in response to a "significant
increase in intelligence threat streams" related to Iran. Some American
officials and European allies have said the administration [has been
overstating threats tied to
Iran](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/world/middleeast/trump-iran-threats.html?module=inline).

For instance, [there has been frequent speculation that Saudi Arabia and
Pakistan have some type of arrangement that would bring Riyadh under
Islamabad's nuclear umbrella.]{.underline}75 This could entail an
announcement by Pakistan that its nuclear arsenal would be used to
defend Saudi Arabia from an attack and retaliate against an aggressor;
the deployment of Pakistani forces armed with nuclear weapons to Saudi
territory; or the development of dual-key nuclear sharing arrangements
similar to those that exist between the United States and some of its
NATO allies.76 Looking further into the future, [other security
providers could emerge. China,]{.underline} for example, clearly has
aspirations to become a global power; it [is highly dependent on oil
from the Middle East]{.underline} to fuel its growing economy; it [is
building a more survivable nuclear arsenal with greater reach; and it
might one day look to undermine the U.S. position as the most
influential outside actor in the Middle East.]{.underline} Although some
analysts would argue that [these scenarios]{.underline} are not
realistic, at least not today, they [reflect]{.underline} two [very real
concerns: U.S. allies who feel]{.underline} seriously [threatened by
Iran and insufficiently assured by Washington might look elsewhere for
support;]{.underline} and[, in the "second nuclear age," the number of
potential security providers is increasing]{.underline}.77 Of course,
[the agreement between the P5+1]{.underline} (the five permanent members
of the UN Security Council plus Germany) [and Iran]{.underline} to place
limits on the latter's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief
has surely dampened these concerns for the time being. Nevertheless, it
[might not eliminate them over the long run]{.underline} for a number of
reasons: [the agreement legitimizes Iran's uranium enrichment program;
provides Iran with the ability to make qualitative improvements in its
fuel-cycle technology; gives Iran the time to further harden its nuclear
facilities by investing resources in more advanced defenses;
and,]{.underline} perhaps most important of all, [increases
suspicions]{.underline} on the part of some local allies [that the
United States plans to pull back from the region]{.underline} in order
to concentrate its attention elsewhere---and might even be seeking a
broader rapprochement with Iran despite Tehran's hostility toward its
neighbors.78 Moreover, [U.S. tools to alleviate these suspicions
are]{.underline} somewhat [limited]{.underline}. For instance, while it
can engage in massive conventional arms sales to local allies and
reiterate its commitment to prevent threats to their sovereignty, [it is
highly unlikely that Washington would enter into any formal alliances
with its most vulnerable allies in the region]{.underline}, especially
[given the popular and political resistance]{.underline} that would
likely emerge [within the United States.]{.underline}79 [Why should the
United States care about the prospect of other nations extending nuclear
deterrence into the Middle East?]{.underline} Two reasons stand out. The
first is that [Washington would lose significant leverage over local
allies if they were no longer as dependent on it]{.underline} to protect
their sovereignty, even if they did not fully defect from the U.S. camp.
[The U.S. would therefore have a diminished ability to restrain them
from taking destabilizing actions or to push them in a positive
direction]{.underline} across a range of issues. The second is that
Washington could face more serious crises in the future. For instance,
[if Pakistan or China had security commitments to local nations, then
crises in South Asia or East Asia could quickly spread to the Middle
East. That, in turn, could make escalation management and crisis
diplomacy far more difficult.]{.underline}

Eighteen months ago, Donald Trump visited Saudi Arabia and said he had
concluded \$110 billion dollars in arms sales with the kingdom. It was
fake news then and it's still fake news today. The Saudis have not
concluded a single major arms deal with Washington on Trump's watch.
Nonetheless, [the U.S. arms relationship with the kingdom is the most
important leverage Washington has as it contemplates reacting to
the]{.underline} alleged [murder of Jamal Khashoggi.]{.underline} FOLLOW

[post]{.underline}](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2017/06/05/the-110-billion-arms-deal-to-saudi-arabia-is-fake-news/)
[detailing that his claims to have sold \$110 billion in weapons were
spurious]{.underline}. Other media outlets subsequently came to the same
conclusion. When Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman visited the
White House this year, the president indirectly confirmed that non-deal
by chiding the prince for spending only "peanuts" on arms from America.
[The Saudis have continued to buy spare parts, munitions, and technical
support for the enormous amount of American equipment they have bought
from previous administrations.]{.underline} [The Royal Saudi Air
Force]{.underline} (RSAF) [is]{.underline} entirely [dependent on
American and British support for its air fleet]{.underline} of F15
fighter jets, Apache helicopters, and Tornado aircraft. [If either
Washington or London halts the flow of logistics, the RSAF will be
grounded]{.underline}. The Saudi army and the Saudi Arabian National
Guard are similarly dependent on foreigners (the Saudi Arabian National
Guard is heavily dependent on Canada). The same is also true for the
Saudis allies like Bahrain. Under President Obama, Saudi Arabia spent
well over \$110 billion in U.S. weapons, including for aircraft,
helicopters, and air defense missiles. These deals were the largest in
American history. Saudi commentators routinely decried Obama for failing
to protect Saudi interests, but the kingdom loved his arms deals. But
the kingdom [has not
bought](http://www.businessinsider.com/saudi-arabia-hasnt-signed-us-arms-deals-talking-to-russia-about-s-400-2018-10)
any new arms platform during the Trump administration. Only one has even
been seriously discussed: A \$15 billion deal for THAAD, terminal high
altitude area defense missiles, has gotten the most attention and
preliminary approval from Congress, but the Saudis let pass a September
deadline for the deal with Lockheed Martin. The Saudis certainly need
more air defenses with the pro-Iran Zaydi Shiite Houthi rebels in Yemen
firing ballistic missiles at Saudi cities. The three and a half year-old
Saudi war in Yemen is hugely expensive. There are no public figures from
the Saudi government about the war's costs, but a conservative estimate
would be at least \$50 billion per year. Maintenance costs for aircraft
and warships go up dramatically when they are constantly in combat
operations. The Royal Saudi Navy has been blockading Yemen for over 40
months. The RSAF has conducted thousands of air strikes. The war is
draining the kingdom's coffers. And responsibility for the war is on
Mohammed bin Salman, who as defense minister has driven Riyadh into this
quagmire. Shaking the arms relationship is by far the most important way
to clip his wings. AVENGING KHASHOGGI [Congress now has the power to
make a serious decision, halting arms sales and the logistics train for
the kingdom in the wake of the reported murder of Saudi critic Jamal
Khashoggi]{.underline} in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul Turkey last
week. [The outrageous attack on Jamal deserves serious reaction, and
given Trump's dereliction of duty on the matter, it is up to Congress to
act]{.underline}. The president may try to override a Senate arms
stand-down but it would be a painful setback for the prince. Jamal's
[last opinion
piece](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2018/09/11/saudi-arabias-crown-prince-must-restore-dignity-to-his-country-by-ending-yemens-cruel-war/?utm_term=.1838a2695d30)
before his death was about the war in Yemen. He called for an immediate
Saudi ceasefire and blamed the war on Mohammed bin Salman. At stake,
Jamal argued, is Saudi "dignity" and its role as a leader in the Islamic
world. It has rightly been seen as an ineffectual bully. Saudi Arabia's
war is alienating people around the world. Across the Muslim world, the
Saudi brand has been damaged. Khashoggi compared Mohammed bin Salman to
Syrian President Bashar Assad as a war criminal. His death only further
darkens Mohammed bin Salman's standing. Much of the world is likely to
treat him and his henchmen as pariahs. The prince's goal in Istanbul was
to intimidate any opposition or criticism no matter how peaceful. The
more blatant and gruesome the intimidation, the more likely it will
chill dissent. But it will also polarize the country and encourage the
deep conspiracies that could violently and suddenly change the kingdom
in very unexpected ways. These are very dangerous waters for the House
of Saud.

#### Arms Sales are Necessary Leverage to Address Human Rights Concerns in Saudi Arabia

Terrence **Guay**, 10-19-**2018**, \"Arms sales to Saudi Arabia give
Trump all the leverage he needs in Khashoggi affair,\" Conversation,
http://theconversation.com/arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia-give-trump-all-the-leverage-he-needs-in-khashoggi-affair-104998

As president, Trump clearly hopes that the money continues to pour in
and helps him with his "[America
First](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-38698654/donald-trump-america-first-america-first)"
campaign, intended to create jobs for Americans.

It's no surprise, then, that he made [his first foreign
trip](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/05/trump-arrives-saudi-arabia-foreign-trip-170520063253596.html) as
president to Saudi Arabia in May 2017. During the trip, he
reportedly [struck a
bargain](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/14/us/politics/trump-saudi-arabia-arms-deal.html)
with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman: Trump wouldn't lecture his
kingdom on human rights, and Saudi Arabia would buy more American
weapons.

Unfortunately, [Trump's claim to have secured \$110 billion in arms
sales has not materialized. Although the Saudis signed numerous letters
of intent and interest, some of which had
been [approved](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2017/06/05/the-110-billion-arms-deal-to-saudi-arabia-is-fake-news/) by
the Obama administration, no
new [contracts](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/10/10/after-khashoggi-us-arms-sales-to-the-saudis-are-essential-leverage/) have
resulted, due mainly to lower oil prices and the Saudis' costly war in
Yemen.]{.underline}

So in the Khashoggi affair, it appears that Trump is eager to keep to
his end of the bargain. He has avoided criticizing the Saudi government
over its alleged role in Khashoggi's disappearance to curry favor with
the monarchy over arms sales. Even in the face of [Turkish
reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/world/europe/turkey-saudi-khashoggi-dismember.html) that
Saudi agents tortured Khashoggi and dismembered his body and [U.S.
intelligence
supporting](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/world/middleeast/pompeo-khashoggi-murder.html) those
allegations, Trump has preferred to [blame "rogue
killers"](https://www.npr.org/2018/10/15/657522089/rogue-killers-may-have-murdered-saudi-journalist-trump-suggests) for
any crime.

In defending this course of action,
[Trump [claimed](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/411271-trump-defends-110-billion-us-arms-sale-to-saudi-arabia) that
"if they don't buy \[weapons\] from us, they're going to buy it from
Russia or they're going to buy it from China or they're going to buy it
from other countries."]{.underline}

US leverage

[While it's true that Russia and China are [indeed major
exporters](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2018-06/yb_18_summary_en_0.pdf) of
armaments, the claim that U.S. weapons can easily be replaced by other
suppliers is not -- at least not in the short term.]{.underline}

First, once a country is "locked in" to a specific kind of weapons
system, such as planes, tanks or naval vessels, the cost
to [switch](http://doi.org/10.1257/jep.8.4.65) to a different supplier
can be huge. Military personnel must be retrained on new equipment,
spare parts need to be replaced, and operational changes may be
necessary.

[After being so reliant on U.S. weapons systems for decades,
the [transition
costs](http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a498941.pdf) to buy from
another country could be prohibitive even for oil-rich Saudi
Arabia.]{.underline}

The second problem with Trump's argument is that armaments from Russia,
China or elsewhere are simply [not as sophisticated
as](https://ssi.armywarcollege.edu/pubs/display.cfm?pubID=1344) U.S.
weapons, which is why they are usually cheaper -- though the quality gap
is quickly decreasing. To maintain its military superiority in the
Middle East, Saudi Arabia has opted to purchase virtually all of its
weapons from American and European companies.

[That is why the U.S. has significant leverage in this aspect of the
relationship.]{.underline} [Any [Saudi
threat](http://fortune.com/2018/10/14/saudis-threaten-retaliation-jamal-khashoggi/) to
retaliate against a ban on U.S. arms sales by buying weapons from
countries that have not raised concerns about the Khashoggi
disappearance would not be credible. And is probably why, despite
worries in the White House, such a threat has not yet been
made.]{.underline}

President Trump pushed back against sanctioning Saudi Arabia over the
disappearance and likely killing of Washington Post contributor Jamal

military equipment from the United States. But this number is fanciful
and unlikely to come to fruition -- and in any case many of the
purported deals are long in the future, according to a detailed list

after a review of the data. The \$110 billion in military sales aroused
great skepticism among experts, with Bruce Riedel of the Brookings
Institution
[calling](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2017/06/05/the-110-billion-arms-deal-to-saudi-arabia-is-fake-news/)
the claim "fake news." Most of the]{.underline} publicly announced
[items had been previously announced by the Obama administration and
there appeared to be few]{.underline}, if any[, signed
contracts.]{.underline} Rather, many of the announcements were MOIs ---
memorandums of intent. [There were six specific items, adding up to \$28
billion,]{.underline} but [all had been previously]{.underline}
[notified to Congress by the Obama administration]{.underline}. After
Trump's remarks on Khashoggi, Reidel said the \$110 billion figure was
"still fake." [He said the Saudis have not bought locked in the arms
deals touted by Trump, even a \$15 billion deal for Terminal High
Altitude Area Defense anti-ballistic missile system]{.underline} that
[has received preliminary approval from
Congress](http://www.dsca.mil/major-arms-sales/saudi-arabia-terminal-high-altitude-area-defense-and-related-support-equipment-and).
He noted that [the Saudis [let a September deadline for the deal lapse
with Lockheed
Martin](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/disappearance-and-alleged-killing-of-saudi-journalist-jamal-khashoggi-could-complicate-us-saudi-relations/2018/10/07/93693ace-ca4f-11e8-a360-85875bac0b1f_story.html?utm_term=.8a78bf2ef4e0),
despite a 20 percent price cut.]{.underline} [A review of
the]{.underline} announcements on the [Defense Security Cooperation
Agency website]{.underline} since Trump's 2017 trip [reveals
that]{.underline}, besides THAAD, [there have been six]{.underline}
State Department [announcements]{.underline} [of approval of Saudi
sales, totaling just \$4 billion]{.underline}. According to the
confidential 2017 document of all of the military-sales agreements
reviewed by The Fact Checker, [most of the items did not have delivery
dates or were scheduled for 2022 or beyond. The THAAD, for instance, was
scheduled for 2023-2026. An order for four ships would not be completed
until 2028. Billions of dollars in bombs are scheduled for delivery in
2022. In essence, this is a wish list.]{.underline} It's worth recalling
that Obama offered Saudi Arabia \$115 billion in deals, about half of
which resulted in actual sales. Trump raised the possibility that the
Saudis might turn to Russia or China for its hardware. The Saudis are
still considering purchasing a Russian S-400 air-defense system, but
Reidel said the kingdom is too invested in U.S. equipment -- which means
the U.S. has significant leverage if it wanted to punish the Saudis over
the Khashoggi matter. "It would take decades to transition from U.S. and
U.K. aircraft, for example, to Russian or Chinese aircraft," Reidel
said. "Same is true for tanks, communications equipment and other
hi-tech equipment. And the Saudis don't have time given they are bogged
down in Yemen." The Pinocchio Test This is an example of a politician
believing his own propaganda. [The \$110 billion-figure is not real and
unlikely to come to fruition]{.underline} -- [and even if it did, it
represents sales far in the future]{.underline}. The president should
scale down the use of the number, especially when talking about a
diplomatic crisis today. [Given that little on the supposed deals has
advanced since Trump's announcement 1 1/2 years ago, we are upping this
to Four Pinocchios.]{.underline}

### Relations Durable

#### Relations Have Been Historically Durable -- Oversight

Daniel **Benjamin**, 5-30-**2019**, \"Reckless in Riyadh,\" New York
Review of Books,
<https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/06/27/mohammad-bin-salman-reckless-riyadh/>
(JSewpersaud)

In the seventy-four years since it was conceived, [the relationship
between the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has shown
remarkable durability]{.underline}. [One reason for its resilience has
been the ease with which it has evolved as the partners prospered and
global politics changed]{.underline}. Riding a tide of oil wealth, Saudi
Arabia has been transformed from a congeries of seminomadic tribes into
one of the twenty largest economies in the world, while US involvement
in regional security grew so dominant that for decades, [analysts spoke
of the pax Americana in the Middle East]{.underline}. [The relationship
has also lasted in no small measure because of American leaders'
disinclination to criticize the Saudis' domestic policies,]{.underline}
especially their disregard for human rights. Bruce Riedel, an adviser on
the Middle East to four presidents, has noted that the sole instance of
an American leader pressing the Saudis for internal change occurred in
1962, when, at the urging of John F. Kennedy, then crown prince Faisal
reformed the judiciary, introduced free health care and education, and
abolished slavery. [The White House has long directly overseen the
US--Saudi relationship]{.underline}, as it has the US--Israel
relationship, but generally not other bilateral ties. [The Saudi
leadership has never taken the US Congress or the State Department
seriously and has always sought a direct link to the
president]{.underline}. The CIA station in Riyadh exercises a high
degree of control over dealings with the kingdom, guarding against
intrusive diplomats with big ideas about promoting human rights and
obliging the Saudi preference for secrecy. The arrangement works in a
country where historically there has been almost no foreign press
presence or civil society organizations. Saudi governance has
traditionally been the preserve of a small number of aged princes. Among
US policymakers and intelligence analysts, it is often said that no
country is more opaque, except for North Korea.

### Link Uniqueness

#### The Relationship should've already degraded after Trump's handling of the Khashoggi Killing -- Non-Unique

Prem G. **Kumar**, 11-21-**2018**, \"Trump Thinks He's Helping the
U.S.-Saudi Relationship. He's Hurting It.,\" Foreign Policy,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/11/21/trump-thinks-hes-helping-the-u-s-saudi-relationship-hes-hurting-it-jamal-khashoggi-mohammed-bin-salman-saudi-arabia-united-states/>
(JSewpersaud)

[Rather than "standing with Saudi Arabia," as U.S. President Donald
Trump suggested he was doing in a bizarre Nov. 20
[statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-donald-j-trump-standing-saudi-arabia/),
the Trump administration may well have complicated the U.S.-Saudi
relationship for years to come]{.underline}. [Trump contends that Saudi
Crown Prince]{.underline} Mohammed bin Salman [may have known about
plans to murder]{.underline} the journalist Jamal
[Khashoggi]{.underline}---"maybe he did and maybe he didn't"---[but that
the United States would stand by the kingdom because]{.underline} of a
shared interest in confronting Iran, potential weapons sales to Saudi
Arabia, and [the need to ensure stable oil markets]{.underline}. The
president's statement seemed designed to bring the Khashoggi matter to a
close. It will likely do precisely the opposite for several reasons.
First, [it is now clear that the Trump administration never had any real
interest in pursuing the truth.]{.underline} [After the story first
broke, Trump could have pressed for a credible
investigation]{.underline} to help assess what actually happened inside
the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. Indeed, other U.S. allies
have called for such investigations in the past. Israel, which has ample
reason to be concerned about outside bodies passing judgement on its
conduct, established a commission of Israeli judges, with respected
international observers, to investigate the deaths of nine Turkish
citizens during a 2010 flotilla to Gaza. The Israeli government did so
to put an end to lingering questions about the naval operation against
the Turkish flotilla. [By contrast, in this case, the Trump
administration is content to let Saudi Arabia act as judge, jury,
and]{.underline}---given the capital charges now filed against at least
five defendants---possibly [the executioner]{.underline}. The fact that
Trump is in such a rush to move on, despite so many outstanding
questions, will redouble demands by others---including leading
Republican senators in the United States---for the truth. [Second, after
failing to press for a credible investigation, Trump seems to have
disregarded intelligence assessments prepared by his own officials about
what happened and who was responsible]{.underline}. Late last week, the
CIA
[concluded](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html?utm_term=.6910a9700865)
with a high degree of confidence that the crown prince ordered the
killing. [The president has downplayed the report and repeatedly
declared that the world may never know all of the facts surrounding
Khashoggi's murder. But that does not mean that the world knows
nothing]{.underline}. Demands to see the full CIA assessment could
linger over the U.S.-Saudi relationship in the same way that the
unreleased 28 pages from the Joint House-Senate Intelligence Committee's
report on potential Saudi involvement in 9/11 did for 13 years, until
they were eventually declassified. Rather than dismissing the CIA's
assessment, Trump could have used the agency's findings to push for an
impartial probe. His willingness to ignore the CIA will now lead to a
new set of questions. Third, instead of using his leverage in this
situation to get a full accounting of what happened in Istanbul and
address other issues in the U.S.-Saudi relationship, the "Master of the
Deal" gave this statement away for free. Take the war in Yemen. After
nearly two years in which the Trump administration abdicated any
meaningful role in ending the worst humanitarian conflict in the world,
it recently changed course, calling for a cease-fire in Yemen within 30
days and suspending midair refueling for the Saudi-led coalition. It did
so at least in part because the White House increasingly realized that
continuing the war is in neither U.S. nor Saudi interests. So far,
however, the response on the ground from Saudi Arabia has been an
escalation near the Yemeni port of Hodeidah. While Washington should not
trade away its concern for human rights, it could have used this crisis
to promote policies it believes are correct anyway, like ending the war
in Yemen. Instead, the conflict---one that is strengthening Iran's
position in the region---continues with no end in sight. [All this for
what? In his statement, Trump cites a Saudi commitment to invest \$450
billion in the United States]{.underline}, of which \$110 billion are
proposed weapons sales. As many observers have pointed out, these
figures are spurious at best, and [with newfound skepticism of Saudi
policies, the likelihood of Congress approving major new weapons sales
is questionable]{.underline}. [As for oil, the Saudis themselves know
that allowing significantly higher prices---which many doubt they could
engineer given U.S. shale production]{.underline}---would harm their own
economy far more than the rest of the world by encouraging alternative
energy sources and uses. And when it comes to Middle East peace, with
the Palestinians boycotting the Trump administration, Israel about to go
into election season, and conditions in Gaza as difficult as ever, the
odds of progress on peace---with or without Saudi support---are about as
low as they could be. Most of all, Trump justifies his approach on the
grounds that it is necessary to stabilize Saudi Arabia amid the broader
contest with Iran. But [this obscures the longer-term consequences of
the administration's approach. By appearing to whitewash the Khashoggi
murder, Trump has helped ensure that it will remain an issue for years
to come, both in terms of finding out what exactly happened and in
determining the proper U.S. response]{.underline}. [The White House's
approach will also exacerbate the partisan divide on Saudi Arabia, with
Democrats pushing for more transparency and accountability and at least
some Republicans trying to defend Trump's policy, while most
others---apart from a few senators---duck for cover]{.underline}. Some
will even question whether the Trump family's business interests played
a role in the administration's response. With questions around
succession in Saudi Arabia looming over the next few years, an
increasingly partisan U.S. approach to the kingdom will not help
stabilize that country or advance the common effort to manage the threat
from Iran. Instead of diplomacy by hasty statement, Trump should have
heeded former Secretary of State James Baker's
[advice](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/22/opinion/khashoggi-saudi-trump-james-baker.html)
from the U.S. response to the Tiananmen Square massacre. To find the
truth, sanction as needed while emphasizing that Washington will keep
channels of communications open. [Trump could have shown that the United
States will uphold its values around the world by uncovering the truth
and ensuring that these sorts of actions have real consequences, while
at the same time affirming that the relationship with Saudi Arabia is
important and that Washington will seek to preserve it in the interest
of both countries]{.underline}. Such an approach may have involved more
short-term challenges, as the Saudis may have resisted a fuller probe of
Khashoggi's death, [but it would have stabilized the U.S.-Saudi
relationship for the long term]{.underline}. Now that the administration
has failed to handle this crisis responsibly, Congress may decide it has
to act. The bipartisan legislation introduced by Sens. Bob Menendez (D)
and Lindsey Graham (R), which would suspend all offensive weapons sales
to Saudi Arabia and mandate sanctions against anyone found to have
responsibility for Khashoggi's murder, is a start. But months of
hearings, subpoenas, and legislative debates await. All the while, the
important work that the United States and Saudi Arabia should be doing
to end regional conflicts, fight terrorism, and promote long-term reform
will not receive the attention or the support it needs. Trump was right
when he noted that the United States' relationship is with the kingdom
and, by implication, not with individual Saudi leaders. [With his
irresponsible statement, the president has done much damage to that
cause.]{.underline}

### Credibility

#### Selling Weapons to Saudi Arabia ruins Credibility -- The US appears soft on arms agreements and endangers civilians

Nima **Elbagir**, 02-**2019**, \"US arms sold to Saudi Arabia and UAE
end up in wrong hands,\" CNN,
<https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2019/02/middleeast/yemen-lost-us-arms/>
(JSewpersaud)

Hodeidah, Yemen (CNN) -- [Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners have
transferred American-made weapons to al Qaeda-linked
fighte]{.underline}rs, hardline Salafi militias, and other factions
waging war in Yemen, [in violation of their agreements with the United
States]{.underline}, a CNN investigation has found. [The weapons have
also made their way into the hands of Iranian-backed rebels]{.underline}
battling the coalition for control of the country,
[exposing]{.underline} some of [America\'s sensitive military technology
to Tehran and]{.underline} potentially [endangering the lives of US
troops]{.underline} in other conflict zones. [Saudi Arabia]{.underline}
and the United Arab Emirates, its main partner in the war, [have used
the US-manufactured weapons as a form of currency to buy the loyalties
of militias]{.underline} or tribes, bolster chosen armed actors, and
influence the complex political landscape, according to local commanders
on the ground and analysts who spoke to CNN. By handing off this
military equipment to third parties, the Saudi-led coalition is
[breaking the terms of its arms sales with the US]{.underline},
according to the Department of Defense. After CNN presented its
findings, a US defense official confirmed there was an ongoing
investigation into the issue. The revelations raise fresh questions
about whether [the US has lost control over a key ally presiding over
one of the most horrific wars of the past decade,]{.underline} and
whether Saudi Arabia is responsible enough to be allowed to continue
buying the sophisticated arms and fighting hardware. Previous CNN
investigations established that [US-made weapons were used in a [series
of deadly Saudi coalition
attacks](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2018/09/world/yemen-airstrikes-intl/index.html)
that killed dozens of civilians]{.underline}, many of them children. The
developments also come as Congress, outraged with Riyadh over the murder
of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year, considers whether to force an
end to the Trump administration\'s support for the Saudi coalition,
which relies on American weapons to conduct its war. In 2015, Riyadh
launched a coalition to oust Iranian-supported Houthi rebels from the
country\'s capital and reinstate the internationally recognized
government of President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi. The war split the
country in two, and with it came the weapons \-- not just guns, but
anti-tank missiles, armored vehicles, heat-seeking lasers and artillery
\-- all flooding into an unruly and complex state. Since then, some of
[America\'s]{.underline} \"beautiful [military equipment]{.underline},\"
as US President Donald Trump once called it, h[as been passed on, sold,
stolen or abandoned in Yemen\'s state of chaos, where murky alliances
and fractured politics mean little hope for any system of accountability
or tracking.]{.underline} [Some terror groups have gained from the
influx of US arms]{.underline}, with the barrier of entry to advanced
weaponry now lowered by the laws of supply and demand. [Militia leaders
have had ample opportunity to obtain military hardware in exchange for
the manpower to fight the Houthi militias]{.underline}. [Arms dealers
have flourished,]{.underline} with traders [offering to buy or sell
anything]{.underline}, from a US-manufactured rifle to a tank, [to the
highest bidder.]{.underline} And Iran\'s proxies have captured American
weapons they can exploit for vulnerabilities or reverse-engineer for
native production.

### Saudi Arabia Not Key to Middle East Stability

#### Turn -- Saudi Arabia Hurts Middle East Stability

Madawi **Al-Rasheed**, 11-1-**2018**, \"Perspective,\" Washington Post,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/five-myths/five-myths-about-saudi-arabia/2018/11/01/3de61f8c-dc5a-11e8-b732-3c72cbf131f2_story.html>
(JSewpersaud)

Marcelle Wahba, [a former U.S. ambassador to the United Arab Emirates,
[argued](https://agsiw.org/gcc-force-regional-stability/) in 2017 that
the Gulf Cooperation Council nations, including Saudi Arabia, help
maintain stasis]{.underline}. "The GCC countries are essentially status
quo-oriented monarchies, and regional stability is a core goal," she
wrote. [Gen. Joseph Votel]{.underline}, the top commander of U.S. troops
in the Middle East,
[[said](https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2018/10/extraordinarily-important-top-us-general-defends-saudi-relationship-yemen-war/152407/)
in late October that there is no change in U.S.-Saudi Arabia military
relations, despite public outrage over Khashoggi's murder. "Saudi Arabia
is an extraordinarily influential and important leader of the Arab world
within the region,]{.underline}" he said. " . . . [Other partners in the
region often look to Saudi Arabia]{.underline} for a lead[, for
leadership,]{.underline} direction, and how they approach broader
security concerns." [The status quo is, however, one of the major
sources of instability in the region]{.underline}. [The 2011 Arab
uprisings came at a time when this status quo]{.underline} --- namely,
[decades of authoritarian rule]{.underline} --- [appeared to explode
under]{.underline} demographic, economic and political [pressure
from]{.underline} truly [pro-democratic forces. Saudi
Arabia]{.underline} and its alarmed Persian Gulf allies [acted as
counter-revolutionaries determined to preserve the autocratic state of
affairs. In Egypt, Saudi money backing dictator Abdel Fatah al-Sissi
returned the country to military rule, repression and political
stagnation. In Syria, Saudi financial and military sponsorship of some
rebels stifled democratic forces and started a sectarian civil
war]{.underline}. In Bahrain, a direct Saudi military intervention led
to the reversal of years of mass mobilization and the quashing of
dissent. By ostracizing and sanctioning Qatar over its media and support
for the Muslim Brotherhood, Saudi actions have caused the GCC to devolve
into a redundant regional coalition [that may never
recover](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/gcc-fall-171107083437029.html).
Forcing the Lebanese prime minister, Hariri, to resign in Riyadh in 2017
(though he rescinded his resignation a month later) threatened to
destabilize yet another Arab country with a fragile hold on peace. [The
worst came in Yemen]{.underline}, where a GCC-brokered agreement
guaranteed the safe return of its president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, who
later turned against his Saudi sponsors. [Since 2015, the Saudis have
launched airstrikes on Yemen that have led to a [catastrophic
humanitarian
crisis](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/as-us-backed-forces-renew-yemen-offensive-un-warns-of-incalculable-human-cost/2018/09/13/f2c549fc-b755-11e8-ae4f-2c1439c96d79_story.html?utm_term=.dbad7ecf4443)
and the total destruction of the country. Such measures reflect Riyadh's
erratic regional policy]{.underline}, **[the main purpose of which is to
preserve the monarchy and authoritarian republicanism in the Arab world
rather than to create long-term stability.]{.underline}**

#### Saudi Arabia Not Key to Middle East Stability -- Jordan can fill in

Sultan **Barakat**, 7-14-**2014**, \"Jordan on the Edge: A Broader
Strategy for Security,\"
Brookings, <https://www.brookings.edu/ar/opinions/jordan-on-the-edge-a-broader-strategy-for-security-2/>
(JSewpersaud)

[For too long, governments of the Middle East and outside actors have
operated in short-term crisis mode, presenting piecemeal policies which
fail to tackle the cycles of instability and violence in the
region.]{.underline} [There is a]{.underline} clear and present [need to
confront the cross-border issues facing the Middle East with a strategy
that takes a regional,]{.underline} rather than country-by-country,
[view]{.underline}. [The Kingdom of Jordan]{.underline}, wedged between
the Gulf monarchies, the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and
escalating twin crises in Syria and Iraq, [can and must be the
cornerstone of such a strategy]{.underline}. For over three years,
[Jordan has lived with armed conflict effectively on its doorstep, as
Syria has descended into a violent civil war]{.underline}. [Thus far,
the Kingdom has remained a relative oasis of stability in a troubled
region, managing to host hundreds of thousands of Syria refugees who
have streamed across the border while still attracting tourists from
neighboring Gulf countries and further afield in large
numbers]{.underline}. **[Despite repeated predictions of Jordan's
imminent demise, due to internal stresses and the tumultuous politics of
the region, it has proven its resilience time and again]{.underline}**.
The Kingdom has consistently met its commitments according to the
principles of international law, such as caring for and hosting large
numbers of refugees, a stance generally rewarded with little more than
international praise and less-than-sufficient aid funds. [Yet as King
Abdullah noted in a statement released last week, the international
community must continue to find ways of supporting Jordan against the
severe challenges it faces.]{.underline} Today, though, a series of
inter-connected factors risk tipping the country past its 'breaking
point'. [Influxes of refugees have put considerable strain on Jordan's
already limited carrying capacity]{.underline} -- today, over 50% of the
Kingdom's population holds refugee status. The Kingdom was already one
of the most water-scarce countries in the world, with less than 145
cubic meters of water per capita annually, before the arrival of more
than 600,000 Syrians fleeing the civil war. With the economy struggling
and unemployment high, there are few jobs to go around for communities
living on the economic margins. More recently, the rapid advances of the
jihadi group the Islamic State (IS) have raised the spectre of the
organization turning its attention to Jordan, as the group threatens
border crossings and appeals to groups inside the Kingdom. While the
Kingdom's security and armed forces have been effective thus far in
guarding the country's borders, they are far less capable of confronting
internal threats to stability, as shown by recent pro-ISIS
demonstrations deep within Jordanian territory, in the southern city of
Ma'an. [Jordan's internal grievances are many, from allegations of
corruption to feelings of economic marginalization in tribal and rural
areas. Limited reforms have garnered some acceptance among the
population,]{.underline} but only to an extent [-- and then largely due
to citizens' fears that the country might suffer economic or political
collapse without some measure of consensus]{.underline}. As recent
demonstrations in Ma'an and elsewhere show, fear cannot provide a
long-term antidote to the bitterness felt in many areas of the Kingdom.
It is time for Jordan's friends to offer more than just rhetoric, arms,
or short-sighted aid. A strategy focused entirely on national security
-- massing troops on the Jordan-Iraq border, for example -- will not
prevent a collapse of the Jordanian state from within. Nor can
humanitarian aid or World Bank loans provide the economic growth and
sustainability needed for Jordan to survive as a land of hope,
moderation and stability. Jordan needs friends who can provide targeted
and productive investments, taking advantage of a highly educated
population to achieve real economic growth. [The country is already a
recognized financial and commercial hub for the region, and is
well-positioned to benefit from further investment in critical areas of
energy and water alongside traditional economic sectors of trade,
tourism, and transportation]{.underline}. Beyond this, specialized
programs are needed to provide some measure of economic opportunity to
new refugees, currently all but isolated from the mainstream economy.
While corruption remains an ongoing concern, the Jordanian government
can build on past reforms to ensure that economic development is coupled
with greater transparency and judicial independence. [As a longstanding
ally of Jordan, the United States can and should demonstrate global
leadership in re-affirming a regional commitment to maintaining Jordan's
stability and security]{.underline}. Still, the present situation calls
for a coalition of supporters, spearheaded by the Kingdom's regional
neighbors, especially Saudi Arabia and Egypt. While the U.S. expanded
its financial assistance to the Kingdom in the wake of the Arab Spring,
and the Gulf Cooperation Council toyed with the idea of extending an
invitation to Jordan, the present situation requires a more coordinated
response. Further collaboration with other actors will be key. Even
Israel can play a constructive role, moving beyond its purely military
view of Jordanian stability to provide support on broader issues such as
maintaining an adequate water supply or developing Jordan's tourism
potential, or even meeting its international obligations towards
refugees in the region. Iran, too, might find a role, as it now faces a
common enemy in ISIS. **[Demonstrating that the international community
and Jordan stand by a set of fundamental values would help stabilize the
region.]{.underline}** The cost of doing so is minimal compared with the
far-reaching consequences of a failed Jordan.
