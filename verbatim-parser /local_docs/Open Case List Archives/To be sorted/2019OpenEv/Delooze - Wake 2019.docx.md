#### A weapon is not just an instrument of violence but rather active in the production of social relations -- weapons are agents that create affective encounters that shape subjectivity. Desire is not a static human interest but rather preconscious social drives that give form to individual interests. The question of arms sales in the resolution is shaped by instrumentalism and ignores the role of micropolitical investment in weapons.

This section develops a theory of weapon agency based in the work of JFC
Fuller, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, and a number of other
contemporary theorists of violence. It suggests that [[weapons
are]{.mark} [defined by]{.mark} distinctive [affective
potentials]{.mark}, which exert formative influence on social life
[rather than]{.mark} [passive instruments]{.mark} of
violence]{.underline}. The section uses this theory to demonstrate that
[[weapons]{.mark} do not merely impact human calculations or facilitate
political violence, but [actively contribute to]{.mark} the [production
of subjectivity and]{.mark}, as a consequence, [security]{.mark} and
warfare]{.underline}. Drawing together Fuller's understanding of war
instruments with Deleuze and Guattari's appreciation for the
independence of objects provides an important avenue for interpreting
the affective implications of weaponry as a distinct form of object.
Indeed, as JFC Fuller puts it nearly a century ago: '[From th e javelin
and the arrow to the super-fortress and the rocket-bomb, the very power
to destroy... has intoxicated man']{.underline} (Fuller 1998, x). Fuller
adds a post-human twist: 'We are entranced by their cunning, their power
and precision, also by the things they give us and the profits we reap
by means of them. [Yet, how they influence us, as living creatures, is
left uncalculated]{.underline}' (x--xi). Fuller's description notes the
various qualities of weapons such as sublimity, cunning, and power,
which draw humans to weapons. Set next to this complex account of the
influences of weapons on 'living creatures', [Fuller's definition of the
weapon as 'an instrument with striking power']{.underline} seems
reductive (16). However, this definition of weaponry [offers a valuable
starting point to theorise the capacity of weapons to incite
desire]{.underline}. Deleuze and Guattari make a similar observation
that [weapons have a privileged relationship to processes of propulsion
in contrast to a tool's introjective model of force]{.underline}
(Deleuze and Guattari 1987). Weapons expend energy in relation to an
exterior milieu whereas tools conserve energy in the process of building
a territory. The notion that a weapon has a 'striking power' captures
how the 'flight' of ballistics expels force while the 'blow' of the
hammer preserves it for another use. Deleuze and Guattari further
differentiate weapons and tools in terms of the vectors of speed and
gravity, free action and work, and expression with jewellry rather than
the order-words and signs (396--401). These distinctions constitute the
series of differential relations that characterise a particular
assemblage, which acts as the formal cause of the weapons and tools
distinction. As they put it, 'the principle behind all technology is to
demonstrate that a technical element remains abstract, entirely
undetermined, as long as one does not relate it to an assemblage it
presupposes ... weapons and tools are consequences, nothing but
consequences' (398--399). The philosophers further distinguish tools and
weapons by examining different 'compositions of desire' as a defining
aspect of both entities (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 399). By
compositions of desire, they refer to the peculiar forms of passion,
drive, and meaning that glue weapons and tools together. With respect to
desire, they argue [that tools presuppose a form of 'introspective
feeling' while weapons operate as 'projectile affects']{.underline}.
[Affects discharge emotions and, as such, resonate with the explosive
properties of the weapon while the tool remains apathetic to the work it
performs]{.underline}. These differences are so stark that Deleuze and
Guattari declare: **['[weapons are affects and affects
weapons']{.mark}]{.underline}** (400). This observation is critical
because the affective capacities of weapons and the weaponisation of
affects take many forms. For instance, as architect Léopold Lambert
argues, [the destructive expenditure unleashed by weapons includes
affective 'operation- \[s\] in which physical bodies are being "broken
down" into smaller material assemblages']{.underline}. As Lambert
describes the process, [an explosion is not defined by temporality or
speed, but by an exothermic reaction latent in a bomb's chemical
components]{.underline}. In a materialist sense, the exothermic reaction
'destroys' by releasing forces that divide assemblages of 6 B. MEICHES
one scale into assemblages of another (Lambert 2013). In this sense, the
weapon's affective power consists of 'striking' organic and inorganic
compounds at a chemical level in order to deform them. Other weapons
work similarly. Swords cleave flesh, bullets pierce armour, and bombs
produce rubble and debris (Gordillo 2014). [These [affective 'striking'
properties of the weapon operate on multiple
levels.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Prior to detonating]{.mark} or piercing,
[the process]{.mark} of targeting or even possessing weapons also
[discharges]{.mark} [affects that reconstitute somatic postures, social
narratives, and incites]{.mark} other emotive [responses]{.mark} such as
fear or terror]{.underline}. In order to account for the affective power
of weapons, I argue that contemporary understanding of 'striking power'
needs to be expanded to include the capacity for material agencies to
divide and reconstitute habits and imaginaries. Many traditional
theories of weapons, such as nuclear deterrence, implicitly presuppose
affective 'striking power' to describe the function of weapons. For
instance, a gap exists between the destructive potential of weapons and
the more limited, actual use of weapons. This gap between actual and
potential use produces a communicative difference, which relies entirely
on affective force. Typically understood as a form of threat, the gap
between what weapons could do and what they actually do sends signals
between parties. These signals enable new mechanisms of force, such as
coercion, by affectively shifting the habits of a targeted or vulnerable
party. However, [the possibility of these affective signals depends on
the weapons \'striking power,\' which impacts a person or stated
affected by a weapon prior to an explosion or physical
impact]{.underline}. Threat is thus a byproduct of the latent potential
of \'striking power.\'. The entire concepts of threat gestures or
postures thus presuppose the affective capacity of the weapon, but they
are not the only products of this gap. For example, the difference
between the potential and actual use of weapons also establishes the
distinctions critical for laws and norms of war, but may also signal
superiority in battle or a different organisation of combat (DeLanda
2005). The 'striking power' of weapons consequently induces complex
affects that befall both human embodiment and relations of desire in
ways that are difficult to predetermine. Hence, the destructive aspects
of weapons constitute only a set of the affective relations that link
humans and weapons. **[[Weapons]{.mark} similarly ['strike' humans in
the form of obsessions]{.mark}, profit, or art; [weapons enchant,
glimmer, and terrify]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Arguably, these affects
also comprise forms of 'striking power' in the broad sense of
rearticulating the affective relations between bodies. [By forming new
kinds of desire, weapons also produce their users]{.underline}. There
are several ways to understand how [weapons affectively mold
subjectivity]{.underline}. Each perspective or model explores a
different mode of encounter between weapons and humans, which reflects
slightly distinct theoretical commitments regarding the role weapons (or
things) play in social life. The first mode of encounter concerns
weapons' ability to augment and transform human imagination. Put simply,
weapons introduce the possibility for imagining otherwise by extending
the capacities of human beings. This interpretation adds a minimal
degree of weapon agency into the dominant explanation of weapons as
tools. In this model, [weapons only alter operations of thought by
introducing new possibilities that change human designs, strategies, and
aspirations]{.underline}. For instance, Sven Lindqvist subscribes to
this model in his illustration of how [the [development of bombing
prompted]{.mark} the [emergence of fantasies of]{.mark} [mass
murder]{.mark} and genocide]{.underline} (2003, 31, 71, 126). Here, the
weapon contributes to the remaking of the world-image and, by doing so,
both endow weapon possessors with a sense of omnipotence that
necessitates certain exercises in political violence (Chow 2006). [This
model also provides an explanation of weapon fetishes, which depends on
an enamour with specific properties bound up in the fantasy of using or
possessing weapons]{.underline}. Another model focuses on the proximity
of weapons and humans. In this case, [living with weapons stimulates
processes of becoming with weapons that paradoxically take the form of a
relationship of embodied care. The soldier maintains and worries about
her rifle and the nuclear scientist for their Intercontinental Ballistic
Missile (ICBM)]{.underline}. In this model, [proximity produces
relations between humans and weapons that connect different affective
properties of each entity]{.underline}, which become a habitual
expression of a lifeworld. [The familiarity and everydayness of the
weapon thus changes the relationship between the weapon and the
user]{.underline}. Indeed, this relationship has been the principal
object of weapon socialisation processes such as training regiments,
military exercises, and martial arts, which rely on exposure and
familiarity with weapons to instruct a person in their proper use (Waal
2010; Grossman 2009). [Each of these [processes of
familiarisation]{.mark} includes a potential for weapons to [redefine
the self through a set of somatic habits]{.mark} and empathic links that
make living with weapons a key part of social life]{.underline}. The
proximity to weapons often fosters a productive relationship to actual
conflict, even in the form of pure simulation, since proximity changes
and invents a new reality or field of conflict (Der Derian 2009).
Similar processes inadvertently occur under duress or threat where
[continuous exposure to the violence of weapons engenders a change in
social structures of empathy and care]{.underline}. In this model,
[[weapons]{.mark} not only [alter]{.mark} fantasies but also [the
corporeality]{.mark} and sociality [of the bodies that encounter
them]{.mark}.]{.underline} The significant effort to decouple weapon
users from their weapons, through institutions such as training and
legal distinctions under the laws of war, reflects the potency of this
relationship since, as safeguards, they presuppose the capacity for the
familiarity with weapons to alter human conduct (Baker 2010; Lunasco et
al. 2010). Put differently, [weapons intervene on somatic rhythms and
relations of embodiment via their proximity]{.underline} and therefore
require strict macro- and micropolitical regimes of governance. A third
model understands the encounter between humans and weapons in terms of a
series of potentials introduced by weapons. This ['abstract' reading
derives from [weapons]{.mark} ability to [synthesise]{.mark} a variety
of discrete [connections between objects, humans, and larger
assemblages]{.mark}]{.underline} including the construction, use, and
care of weapons. These potentials, which remain unactualised, produce
contingent reactions to weapons, which cannot be predefined by the
function or purpose of the weapon. Put differently, a weapon operates as
a pluripotential object that stimulates multiple forms of desire that
cannot be derived from the apparent utility of weapons for humans. The
'fantasy' and 'familiarity' models would thus be only a subset of the
broader relations formed by the potential opened by the 'striking power'
affects of the weapons. In this respect, it is important recall the
earlier point that as striking instruments, [weapons emerge in relation
to an exterior milieu rather than an interior territory]{.underline}
(Deleuze and Guattari 1987). Unlike tools, which work towards a specific
end in a process of construction and must be freed from this model to
perform otherwise, [the potentiality of the weapon hinges on a far wider
and arguably more creative form of expenditure, which involves the
negative rearticulation of possibility]{.underline}. Put differently,
the potentiality lingering on the cutting edge of the weapon, the
capacity to void other relations, strikes human subjects and alters
desires irrespective of their conscious acknowledgment of the process.
This potentiality grows with the expansion of processes of weaponisation
and, in effect, generates positive feedback loops. [Weapons' potential
stimulates greater investment]{.underline} (social, economic, military,
and affective) [in weapons, which augments the potential of weapons in
multiple forms]{.underline}. [The striking power of the weapon not only
works as an instrument, unconscious fantasy, or because of the proximity
of arms but works also on the production of human subjectivity and
desire at the broadest and most intimate levels]{.underline}. Two
examples show how this third model operates and directly challenge the
presumption of human sovereignty over weapons by demonstrating how
weapons influence subjectivity. First, Klaus Theweleit's work Male
Fantasies unpacks the forms of desire and weaponry at work in the
freikorps and Nazi leadership (1989, 1987). Theweleit's argument, which
remains largely ignored in studies of war and conflict, is that the
[[freikorps conceptions of self, state, and society were entangled with
processes of weaponisation]{.underline}]{.mark}. The freikorps,
according to Theweleit, were not exclusively intent on the destruction
of the Weimar Republic, Jewish people, or the Soviet Union, but with the
articulation of self through the process of destruction itself. In this
sense, the freikorps enemies were liquid, potential, fluidly targeted on
account of their ontological difference rather than static, eugenic
categories. Their image of body, society, and state defined by a rigid
schema except, as Theweleit shows, during the act of killing, which
provided a space of creativity. Destruction thus formed a crucial part
of the freikorps articulation of identity as their very purpose was to
make war 'more than a profession, \[but\] a state of being' (Theweleit
1989, 396). As the means of destruction, weapons play a powerful role in
the freikorps articulation of self such that they identify with their
weapons as vehicle of a perpetual seek and destroy mission. The
freikorps thus envision their lives as means of destruction long before
engagement with enemies (Theweleit 1987, 218--225). In short, [[weapons
reconstruct the freikorps very capacity to desire]{.mark}, the forms
desire takes, and the ultimate form of life of the
freikorps]{.underline} such that they discover a virtually unlimited
series of enemies and sources of danger to destroy. Another example is
brilliantly outlined by Banu Bargu's Starve and Immolate: The Politics
of Human Weapons. Bargu's text describes the formation of necropolitical
resistances that challenge the coherence of a biopolitics of life. In
doing so, she theorises a process of ['the weaponization of life' as
'the tactic of resorting to corporeal and existential practices of
struggle, based on the technique of self-destruction, in order to make a
political statement or advance political goals']{.underline} (Bargu
2014, 14). The emergence of these 'human weapons' illustrates the
potential for weapons to directly affect politics by reorganising the
relationship between life and death. Life forms have a long history at
war (Cudworth and Hobden 2015), but many of these examples are cases
where militaries exploit the design features of an organism just like
metallic weapons exploit the properties of metal. The appearance of
'human weapons', in contrast, marks the point where weapons redefine the
purpose, function, and possibilities of life and death. However, this
process is both a 'weaponisation of life' and a 'vitalisation of the
weapon', since the possibility of human weaponisation presupposes the
capacity for weapons to augment human desire and self-understanding so
that the nature, role, and function of life and political conflict
transform (Bargu 2014). In this regard, the weapon no longer works as
simply a tool, but as a positive influence in human life if not
constituting a new form of life altogether. Put differently, the
subjects of Bargu's study develop because of the potential for weapons
to transform the conception of self. [This possibility depends on a set
of potentials opened up by weapons and discloses how the reworking of
desire relies on affective channels that go beyond imagination or
proximity.]{.underline} Furthermore, [these examples imply a full
reversal of the assumption of human sovereignty over weapons by
revealing the possibility that [weapons alter the]{.mark} very
[definition of human life both symbolically and
technically]{.mark}]{.underline}. These limited cases create a number of
problems for theories of the control and management of weapons. First,
[[they destabilise the assumption]{.mark} that [humans direct weapons to
predetermined]{.mark} [ends]{.mark} and, by doing so, challenge
traditional accounts of the genesis of insecurity and armed
conflict]{.underline}. Second, they suggest that, on account of their
potentiality, [weapons have the capacity to modify desire by creating
new constituencies that will advocate for them, use them, ensure their
reproduction as a form of non-life, and take them on as integral to
their mode of life.]{.underline} **[[Weapons]{.mark} thus [cannot
be]{.mark} easily [separated from their capacity to build
assemblages]{.mark} with human beings who bear them as vital objects of
desire.]{.underline}** Un fortunately, discussions of warfare have
largely excluded this dimension of weaponry from scrutiny. Section 3. On
war (without weapons) Where do weapons appear in traditional accounts of
war? How might the absence of weapon agency impact explanations of
conflict and violence? In his classic study, Carl von Clausewitz notes
that weapons participate in war, but argues that [war 'is an act of
violence intended to compel our opponent to fulfill our
will']{.underline}. In this statement, [Clausewitz defines war as an
expression of human will and the activity of warfare as a confrontation
of these wills]{.underline}. In this process, 'violence, that is to say,
physical force ... is therefore the means; the compulsory submission of
the enemy to our will is the ultimate object' (Clausewitz 1908, 2). For
Clausewitz, this distinction between the objectives of war and the means
of war is crucial since it grounds his analysis of the fog of war,
friction, and his ultimate claim that war is politics by other means,
yet war remains a process directed by human interests. However,
Clausewitz also employs this distinction to describe the genesis of war.
Conflict develops from a combination of 'hostile intention' and
'instinctive hostility' that determine the goals of war and distinguish
'the importance and duration of the interests involved' (Clausewitz
1908, 4). As a matter of rational state policy, war derives from the
pursuit of objectives that are determined by and subordinate to these
affective forms of hostility. Hence, Clausewitz both establishes and
problematises the rational governance of war by describing conflict as
bound to a series of fluid feelings including terror, fidelity, or
enjoyment, which deviate from predictive analysis. For Clausewitz, these
deviations generate internal limits to war because of the tension that
emerges from the interaction between volitional objectives, inclement
dispositions, danger, and expenditures of force (5--10). War is thus an
activity where the interests at stake and underlying hostilities
transform as a conflict unfolds. In this sense, the limits of war are
not informational, but affective insofar as they materialise within war
as the objectives of war intersect with the other chimerical aspects of
conflict. As beings usually averse to danger, these affective responses
help human communities avert the absolute tendencies of war to go to the
extreme. Thus, Clausewitz argues that war unintentionally 10 B. MEICHES
produces encounters of will, which alter the form and outcome of
conflict. Put differently, the means of warfare transform the ends of
war from within. If the means of war change the goals of war, then the
means principally affect the will or desire for war. Yet, Clausewitz
remains silent on the role of weapons in this process. By reading
weapons back into Clausewitz's account of war, seeing how they play a
critical, but unexamined role in his theory, the constitutive influence
of weapons in human conduct comes into clearer light as a long-standing
aspect of war and insecurity. In this sense, Clausewitz views war as the
means to alter will or desire, but weapons, as the means of the means,
only appear a few times in his account. First, Clausewitz notes weapons
in his description of the terminal state of an ideal conflict, which he
describes as the 'disarmament' of the enemy (Clausewitz 1908, 2). Here,
weapons are notable because their absence produces positive evidence
that the ends of war have been achieved. Second, weapons appear briefly
in his discussions of tactics and strategy. As Clausewitz states: 'the
range and effect of different weapons is very important ... their
construction ... is a matter of indifference; for the conduct of War is
not making powder and canon' (113). Moreover, Clausewitz retains this
distinction: weapons 'are made suitable to the nature of the fighting,
consequently \[they\] are ruled by it; but plainly the activity engaged
in these appliances is a different thing from the fight itself ...
arming and equipping are not essential to the conception of fighting is
plain, because mere wrestling is also fighting' (84--85). In this
statement, Clausewitz reiterates the instrumental model of weaponry
since weapons only matter insofar as they serve the ends of war.
However, if the terminal state of conflict occurs only after disarmament
then the presence of weapons is a necessary if not sufficient condition
of war. Clausewitz's paradigm consequently reflects the dominant reading
of weapons as tools, but his theorisation simultaneously depends on the
capacities of weapons to introduce the possibility of conflict (Verbeek
2006). Indeed, while Clausewitz views the turbulent nature of conflict
as a product of conflicting wills, [weapons appear at key moments as
forces that augment or transform will]{.underline}. [[Weapons]{.mark}
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} thus not intermediaries in the Latourian
sense, but [[mediators of war that exert formative influence]{.mark}
[over]{.mark} [soldiers]{.mark} on the line, [populations]{.mark}
subjected to terror, [and state leadership]{.mark}]{.underline} (1994).
[Weapons produce these affects because of the potentials they harbour,
which afflict competing forces]{.underline}. Their 'striking power' is
thus present in the allure of fantasies that form the goals that lead to
war, the dispositions and sensations of soldiers in conflict, and
contingent encounters that produce the chanciness of battle. Hence,
[Clausewitz describes the termination of conflict as a possibility only
when one side has been disarmed providing unilateral control over the
affective properties of war]{.underline}. By implication, Clausewitz's
account of the chaotic nature of conflict depends on the intensity of
wills and affects, which emerges from relations engendered by weapons.
Much as military strategists speak of 'force-multipliers', weapons are
the absent 'willmultipliers' of Clausewitz's vision of war. Clausewitz's
explanation of war, however, also underestimates the importance of
weapons in producing conflict in the first place. Assuming Clausewitz's
definition of war is sound, the possibility of employing force to
produce a compulsory submission of will presupposes a capacity for
force. This capacity depends on the properties of weapons. Clausewitz's
decision to build his account of war on the model of the duel
illustrates this point. The parity of force introduced by the duel
assumes a set of social CRITICAL STUDIES ON SECURITY 11 obligations,
rituals, and beliefs, but the duel also presumes equity of access,
training, and armament among the participants (Holland 2008). This
parity underlies the emergence of codes, rules, and affects, such as
honour and courage, which historically governed the duel. Clausewitz's
decision to model war on the duel not only reflects his aristocratic
context but also how the presumption of equity frames what things matter
in the analysis of war as an ideal. The presumption of parity makes the
'victory' of the duel depend exclusively on human 'skill' in combat by
isolating other forms of inequity. By framing war as a duel, Clausewitz
builds this assumption into his theory. Weapons not only transform the
activity of war as means but also enable the social formation of war as
a consequence of their potentialities. Each version of weapon desire
outlined the previous section highlights this point. First, as
conditions of possibility for the realisation of armed desires, [the
fantasies of completely disarming an opponent make presumptions about
the importance of weapons in developing the will to fight]{.underline}.
As the ideal end of conflict, weapon agency is present in the set of
imaginaries linked to practices of warfare. Second, [the proximity of
weapons renders them available as means of war]{.underline}. In this
sense, weapons exist in Clausewitz's account as critical elements of
training, which facilitate warfare and the set of human affects,
principally courage, which are key to battlefield success. The practice
of training and familiarisation with the weapon enables the prolonged
exposure to war that provides an advantage to different sides in armed
conflict. Hence, weapon familiarisation accounts for why armed forces,
which are similarly equipped produce different outcomes in war. Third,
[[weapons]{.mark} augment the desire for war in a more abstract sense
because they [produce the absolute tendencies of war to the
extreme]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unlike the duel, which uses the ideal of
parity to restrain the influences of weapons, [war unleashes the
potential of weapons as an unlimited space of their use]{.underline}.
These potentials engender the self-augmenting tendencies of war towards
the absolute, a process driven by the link between weapons and the
potentiality of destruction. In this way, Clausewitz identifies the
development of force (weapons and weapon users) to stimulate an opponent
to do the same in a positive feedback loop. In short, **[[weapons
incite]{.mark} the [demand for more weapons and intensify]{.mark} the
[possibility of conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. At the same time,
weapons also create the series of affective responses to conflict (fear
for one's life, disgust at violence, etc.), which restrict the
tendencies of war to the extreme. [The potentiality of weapons as the
means of war thus both incites human desires for war and produces the
motivations to avoid war.]{.underline} As desire-producing entities,
weapons constitute not only a precondition for war in Clausewitz's
theory but also occupy an important place as battlefield mechanisms or
operators that avert these tendencies. This point is crucial in
relationship to the larger literature in IR and security studies. If the
formative influence of weapons both spurs and undermines conflict, then
both [[traditional explanations of]{.mark} the causal origins of armed
[conflict]{.mark} and the potential remedies to war [may be placing
faith in the wrong variables]{.mark}]{.underline}. While traditional
literature has long emphasised the potential for weapons to both reduce
and increase the intensity or likelihood of conflict, the Clausewitzian
assumption that these reactions are the natural responses of rational
beings frames how they are understood in relation to armed conflict. In
contrast, this account shows that weapons play an essential if invisible
role in Clausewitz's rendering of war and rearticulate the dispositions
and tendencies that give rise to conflict. These tendencies can also be
traced to forms of contemporary warfare. 12 B. MEICHES Section 4.
Weapons of the hunt Criticisms of the emergence of drone warfare offer
another example of how weapons contribute to the possibility of war. In
compelling critiques of the implicit principles of drone warfare (Shaw
2016; Holmqvist 2013; Shaw 2005) and critical analyses of the unique
phenomenology of the drone operation and targeting (Gusterson 2016;
Wilcox 2015), scholars of critical security politics often maintain that
remote warfare constitutes a novel development in late modern war.
Grégoire Chamayou's provocative account of drone warfare as a form of
'cynegetic' war illustrates this point (Chamayou 2012). By cynegetic
war, Chamayou describes a predatory form of warfare in which unequal
access to arms and power enables one side to hunt the other in contrast
to a biopolitical model of war where the care and protection coincide
with the elimination of specific threats to a population. Drones, the
quintessential instruments of manhunting, are a prime example of how
modern warfare is cynegetic in character. Despite his intricate reading
of the role of the drone, at certain points Chamayou's argument
reproduces dimensions of Clausewitz's classical account of war by
reducing the 'striking power' of the weapon, an affective potential that
links arrows to drones. Chamayou interprets the history of cyngetic war
'not only \[as\] the techniques of tracking and captures but also of
procedures of exclusion, of lines of demarcation drawn within the human
community in order to define the humans who can be hunted' (Chamayou
2012, 2, my emphasis). Tracing the historical transformations of the
relationship between the hunter and the hunted, Chamayou outlines
specific forms of enjoyment peculiar to hunting war. These kinds of
enjoyment derive from the paradoxical status of the hunter/hunted
relationship. To hunt other humans is both the greatest form of hunting
because humans, as equals, pose the greatest challenge and risk and,
simultaneously, a practice predicated on reducing other humans to an
inferior status. The hunt thus involves a uniquely exciting form of
danger, precarity, and sense of power. Cynegetic warfare consequently
proliferates justifications that ontologically differentiate the hunter
and the hunted on the basis of the act of capture. In this way, cyngetic
warfare is unlike other types of war because it relies principally on
expression of power. As Chamayou puts it cynegetic war 'has no
foundation other than force' (13). Chamayou reads cynegetics in drone
warfare in the form of 'pattern-of-life' analysis, the pursuit of
powerless combatants, and the dissolution of the classical
spatial-temporal boundaries of war, which foments a practice analogous
to assassination (Chamayou 2015). Emerging drone doctrines such as
combatant immunity, precision warfare, and legal defences of remote
killing mark the creation of a new doctrine of necro-ethics (killing
well) that enables cynegetic warfare without limits (186--190). At a
crucial point in this argument, Chamayou characterises the logic of a
kamikaze that destroys themselves in attack, as 'my body is a weapon'
(84). In contrast, the logic of the drone is 'my weapon has no body',
which creates an impassable distance between the operator and 'the
exposure to death' (84). This form of distance reduces the negative
repercussions of inflicting violence, which explains why drones offer a
perfect instrument for the expansion of democratic warfare since they
involve none of the emotive turbulence that Clausewitz identified as
central to curbing the absolute tendencies of armed conflcit (184--7).
The drone thus establishes a paradigm of perpetual offensive military
action. While Chamayou describes on the break in the phenomenological
unity CRITICAL STUDIES ON SECURITY 13 of the drone operator, his
argument attends less to the phenomenological relationship between the
operator and the drone or the forms of proximity and intimacy that drone
warfare enables. In this sense, his schematic reading of the weapons
systems does not theorise the productive relationship between the
operator, the weapon, and broader affects. As several scholars have
addressed, drones produce a distinct blend of 'remote intimacy' that
both removes and links the operator directly into the battlefield
(Gusterson 2016, 59--83). However, examining the phenomenology of the
drone provides only one possible explanation of the recent investments
in drone warfare. Another path explores the affective potential produced
by drones as distinctive types of weaponry. In this respect, Chamayou
notes that cyngetic war creates unique forms of enjoyment, which
reflects the satisfaction of chase and capture. These forms of enjoyment
correspond closely with the fantasies of mastery, relations of training,
and affective potentials analysed earlier in this article. Moreover,
similar to other weapons, these potentials produce desires for a
specific form of war. The minimal threshold of influence necessary for
war, the desire for war, hinges less on politics as the ability to
decide the legitimate case of conflict or hunting as a method of capture
and more on the capacities for weapon autonomy introduced by the drone.
However, Chamayou describes these dynamics as unique properties of drone
warfare. In doing so, he overlooks a potential lineage between drones
and older forms of weapons, which, as producers of desire, contribute to
the creation of armed conflict by inciting desire. Theories of drone
warfare centred on the novelty of the drone or the legitimation for
cygnetic warfare may thus overstate the case that weapon agencies only
now enable limitless conflict since, as this article argues, weapons
capacity to foment the desire for war is a key characteristic of their
relationship to humans. In this regard, it is useful to compare
Chamayou's account to an entirely different genealogy of political
violence, namely, Zainab Bahrani's glosses of sovereign power in ancient
Mesopotamia. While Bahrani's reading focuses on figural inscriptions,
these images graphically mark the distinction between the hunter and the
hunted, sovereigns and slaves (Bahrani 2008). The motif of cynegetic
warfare is thus particularly prominent in these images, which depicts
motifs of hunter-kings in many ways analogous to the biblical figure of
Nimrod analysed by Chamayou. Several of the inscriptions Bahrani
describes offer pictographic narratives of 'becoming-sovereign'. These
images are striking because they render visible the process of arming
and forming a sovereign (189--195). Put simply, in these inscriptions,
the sovereign becomes sovereign by entering into a relationship with
weapons. Specifically, Bahrani's images narrate the trajectory of a
ruler's origins, conquests, and ultimate seizure of sovereignty. Weapons
play a key role in the narrative. Arrows, for instance, operate
simultaneously as cues for reading the pictographic narrative, marking
sequences of time or movement, and serve as representations of physical
weapon. At the same time, the weapon figures in the narrative as key to
the expansion of the sovereign's power, the turn of the arrow marking
the sovereign as sovereign. The mythical presentation of rise of
sovereign power thus relies both materially, symbolically, and
graphically on the force of weapons as fantasy objects in proximity to
the king, which institutes new relationships between different political
bodies. In a sense, weapons engender a morphological transformation of
the king (Bahrani 2008). By describing 14 B. MEICHES these processes,
these images both describe extant forms of desire in relationship to
weapons, and also inscribe that desire in the narrative account of the
events. In doing so, the images disclose the potential for weapons to
serve a foundational role as agents moulding the shape of political and
military relations in ancient Mesopotamia. The parallels between the
arrow in ancient Mesoptamia and the drone in modern cynegetics warfare
are worth noting. In both contexts, the weapon's agency is highly
visible and generates the conditions for new expressions of human force.
In both settings, isolating the will of the sovereign or the expansion
of drone warfare is challenging because the exertion of sovereignty
presupposes the affective potential of the weapon to both form and
actualise human desire. While the drones depend on technical
innovations, their capacity to generate new political relations and
forms of desire is a latent feature of weapons that affect human
capacities for being political just as the arrow introduces abstract
potentials that serve as a condition of possibility for the expression
of ancient sovereignty. In this regard, the arrow and the drone share a
legacy as desiring machines, which foster the capacity to do violence at
a remove that, in turn, enables images, symbols, narratives, and new
practices of warfare. The presence of weapons in the field of warfare
thus not only changes the articulation of sovereignty but also invents
new utilities for weapons in multiple political spaces (writing,
history, empire building, policing, war). [The weapon thus contributes
to forms of desire that incite violence whether in the form of a
historical empire or contemporary technocratic dominance]{.underline}.
Thus, while drone warfare is novel in the sense of a technical creation
capable of instituting new degrees of remoteness, the drone's ability to
create new investments in war is a reiteration of a long-term feature of
weapons as producers of human desire rather than a new feature of modern
cyngetic war. Conclusion [Reading weapons as tools subject to human
intentions limits insights into the relationship between weapons and
politics]{.underline}. By diminishing the agentic capacities of weapons,
[**[an anthropocentric bias informs the way weapons, armed conflict, and
political power are understood]{.underline}**.]{.mark} In contrast,
[[conceptualising weapons as agents that foster human desires]{.mark}
[makes]{.mark} several [contributions]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the study of
the origins, continuity, and end of [armed
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The position outlined by this
article poses three distinctive challenges to traditional and critical
analyses of security. While it is beyond the scope of this article to
fully develop each insight, this conclusion briefly highlights each
point in order to flesh out the larger implications of the argument.
First, [reprising weapons as agents of desire offers another
interpretive mechanism for explaining the rise of discourses and
processes of securitisation]{.underline} since weapons, to varying
degrees, introduce humans to new affective potentials. **[[Security
is]{.mark} thus [a discursive construct]{.mark}, but one [that weapons
stimulate]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Studies of]{.mark} targeting, threat
construction, and [otherisation would]{.mark} thus [benefit from
a]{.mark} more [concrete examination of]{.mark} the development of
[weapon systems]{.mark}]{.underline} since these likely produce forms of
desire that render violent social conditions possible. Second, [weapon
desire plays a more significant role in the formation of war and
violence than previous studies have maintained]{.underline}. Weapons
interact with humans through numerous modes of encounter such as somatic
rhythms, powers of fantasy, and political potential. As Latour's initial
quote indicates, [the beauty of the weapon or the impulse to stab comes
from an encounter with a weapon that incites a desire for weapon
use.]{.underline} Predicting the form this encounter takes, whether it
undermines or expands the likelihood violence, is, however, more
difficult than quantifying the number of arms, comparing relative power,
detailing the social construction of a weapon, or even analysing
targeting technics. Instead, the materialist analysis of the 'striking
power' of the weapon shows that [weapons have a far more contingent, but
nonetheless fundamental relationship to the possibility of
war.]{.underline} This contingency poses a serious challenge to accounts
of the causes of war and conflict (or even 'isolated' cases of violence
such as friendly fire casualties or accidental shootings) that explain
security politics in terms of fixed interests, stable power structures,
or static ideology. In each case, the relationship between weapons and
desire introduces the possibility of both promoting and undermining
attachments to violence and, as such, requires a more careful form of
analysis. Finally, while it is beyond the purview of this article, the
**[existence of weaponised desires complicates traditional explanations
of arms control and disarmament.]{.underline}** In specific, this
argument suggests that [along with normative and legal
commitments]{.underline}, [arms control and [disarmament require]{.mark}
a process of [de-weaponising desire]{.mark} or, put differently, active
efforts to diminish the formative influence of weapons in social
life]{.underline}. Since the 'striking power' of weapons affects
fantasies, embodiment, and potentiality, **[[critical work cannot
simply]{.mark} reject or [ban weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Rather,
[the [weapon--human relationship requires micropolitical work]{.mark} on
the investment in weapons, **[which goes beyond]{.mark} outlawing
weapons or [relying on normative prohibition
regimes]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In this sense, [tackling the question of
war, domination, and other forms of political violence requires
wrestling with the way that weapons generate forms of desire that link
humans to the potentials]{.underline} introduced by weapons. In short,
arms control presumes too much about human sovereignty when, in many
respects, arms produce and control their users through the medium of
desire.

#### Transcendent understanding of weapons is grounded in a representational metaphysics that relies on the reification of categories and produces dualistic images of thought. Instrumentalism relies on the flawed humanist conception of a unified subject -- the 1ac is an immanent ontological critique that portrays the body as a surface of intensities and thinks of difference in of itself. Replacing being with becoming is key to understanding desiring-machines as a series of connections rather than a fundamental lack.

This brings us, finally, to Deleuze. Ann Weinstone has grouped Deleuze's
work with the 'major philosophical and techno-scientific sources for
progressive posthumanism' (Weinstone 2004: 10). I am wary of embracing
the term 'posthuman' in relation to Deleuze's work. Its use to indicate
mutually exclusive theoretical stances means that it risks meaning
everything and nothing, while muddying the conceptual field. However,
given its popular currency in cultural theory, this is probably a losing
battle. If we want to situate Deleuze in regard to this discourse and
ask whether he is a posthumanist, then I contend that the answer depends
very much on which form of posthumanism we have in mind. It seems
evident to me that of the two views outlined here (admittedly, with a
speed and superfi ciality that risks caricature), [[Deleuze]{.mark}'s
thought would align quite well with the 'materialist', and would be
vigorously opposed to the 'dualist']{.underline}. That is to say, if by
'posthumanist' we mean that [he [questions]{.mark} Enlightenment
rationality and [the unity of the subject]{.mark}, while [insisting on
a]{.mark} form of [critique]{.mark} [that]{.mark} [encompasses]{.mark}
both [material conditions and cultural codings]{.mark}]{.underline},
then it would be fair to call Deleuze a posthumanist. If we mean,
instead, that [Deleuze and Guattari's [becoming-machine]{.mark} and
machinic assemblages [can be equated to]{.mark} Moravec's exhortations
literally to ['upload' human]{.mark} consciousness into superior
machines]{.underline}, then the term is not only inaccurate, [but it
also [risks a gross misunderstanding]{.mark} of Deleuze's, and Deleuze
and Guattari's, overall project]{.underline}. However, as the last
sentence indicates, the first question we face in deciding where to
situate Deleuze and Guattari's work in the posthumanist debates is what
to make of certain superficial resonances between some of Deleuze and
Guattari's more ecstatic statements and a Moravecian image of merging
with machines. How do we respond to those who see congruities between
Deleuze and Guattari's machinic production, Body without Organs (BwO)
and assemblages on one hand, and Moravec's merging of intelligence into
machines on the other? Is Moravec's vision of mind merging with machine
not just an example of the kind of impure minglings, assemblages, and
cross-pollinations that Deleuze and Guattari urge us towards? Is it, in
fact, not the inevitable result of Deleuze and Guattari's own
de-privileging of the human and their blurring of the boundary between
the organic and non-organic? In short, is Moravec's 'becoming machine'
not a prime example of what it would mean to embrace a Deleuze and
Guattarian ontology of becoming? A cursory reading of Anti-Oedipus and A
Thousand Plateaus, or a chance encounter with select excerpts, might
indeed leave one with the impression that Deleuze and Guattari are
promoting a kind of 'becoming' that would ultimately transcend the
'merely' human body. The language is undeniably there: the talk of
'freedom' and 'liberation', the image of becoming almost anything other
than human, the machinic assemblages. Taken out of context, phrases like
'the real difference is not between the living and the machine' (Deleuze
and Guattari 1983: 285) might seem to support a Moravecian view. The
obvious fi rst response is that [what Deleuze and Guattari mean by
machines, whether they speak of '[desiring-machines]{.mark}', 'social
machines', 'organic machines', 'war machines', or 'machinic
assemblages', is simply not what Moravec or Kurzweil means by
machines.]{.underline} Deleuze and Guattari are not talking about
computers, or steam engines for that matter, when they discuss whether
there is a difference between the living and the machine (Deleuze and
Guattari 1983: 285). '[Machines' [offer]{.mark} Deleuze and Guattari [a
way to talk about the differential interactions of forces]{.mark} and
processes of individuation that underlie, connect, [and]{.mark}
structure all entities]{.underline}, whether mineral, animal, or
machine. This leads us to the longer response, which is that such a
cursory, impressionistic reading misses the fact that [Deleuze and
Guattari's many 'machines' are part of [a larger ontological]{.mark}
[critique]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [one, moreover, that is firmly
[situated in a materialist refusal of transcendence]{.mark} [that
is]{.mark} incompatible with a Moravecian worldview]{.underline}.
Deleuze laid out the basis of this ontological critique in 1968 in the
first fully developed statement of his own thought, Difference and
Repetition.8 [Hayles has identified the shift from humanism to the
posthuman with a 'significant shift]{.underline} in underlying
assumptions about subjectivity' [[towards a conception of the subject
as]{.underline}]{.mark} 'an amalgam, a collection of heterogeneous
components, [[a material-informational entity whose boundaries undergo
continuous construction]{.underline}]{.mark} and reconstruction'

(Hayles 1999: 3). In Difference and Repetition, Deleuze lays the
groundwork for just such an ambitious and fundamental shift in the
conception of subjectivity. Situating his critique squarely against
Aristotle, Plato, Hegel, and Kant, [[Deleuze argues against a
representational metaphysics]{.mark} and epistemology [that relies on
the reification of categories]{.mark} [and produces]{.mark} [a]{.mark}
dualistic and [transcendent 'image of thought']{.mark}.]{.underline} The
shift that Deleuze proposes is nothing less than a complete
re-evaluation of the Western philosophical canon. At the heart of this
re-evaluation is a critique of 'the subject' and the logic of identity
that makes this subject possible. Drawing on Duns Scotus, Spinoza, and
Nietzsche, Deleuze calls into question the negations and either/or
structures that efface real differences and argues for a mode of thought
that does not subjugate difference to identity (Deleuze 1994: esp.
281--2). Instead, he offers a theory of forces that are differentiated
by varying degrees of intensity. These [[differences in intensity
produce]{.mark} [more differentiations in an exponential process
that]{.mark} finally [produces]{.mark} entities that we recognize as
discrete objects, individuals, and eventually, subjects]{.underline}.
[Deleuze's point here is that difference is prior to and produces
individuals]{.underline}. This has two consequences: the individual is
the result of a series of differentiations, not an essence; and as a
contingent result of an ongoing process, the 'individual' (here we can
fi ll in 'object', 'self', or any entity) is merely shorthand for a
relatively stable state of affairs that is both partially determined by
previous states and open to change. Another important point that will be
relevant in Deleuze and Guattari's work, and in relation to
posthumanism, is that [on this ontological account [there are no
firm]{.mark} or absolute [boundaries between one 'thing' and the
next]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Boundaries]{.mark} exist]{.underline}, as
zones of consistency, [but they [remain permeable and open to
transformation]{.mark}, or becoming other]{.underline}. It is in
Difference and Repetition that [Deleuze introduces and argues for
'becoming' as a more accurate description of our ontological situation
than Platonic 'being']{.underline}. In his work with Guattari,
'becoming' is often taken as just a trendy catch phrase. Turning to
Difference and Repetition, we see that 'becoming' is crucial to the
fundamental shift in subjectivity for which Deleuze argues. [[Becoming
refers]{.mark} both [to the endless process of differentiation
and]{.mark} to [our relation to our own
subjectivity]{.mark}.]{.underline} Deleuze's concept of becoming is
indebted to Nietzsche, who advocates '\[b\]ecoming as inventing,
willing, self-negating, self-overcoming: no subject but a doing,
positing, creative' (Nietzsche 2003: 138). [In displacing identity and
being with difference and becoming, Deleuze argues for a new
understanding of subjectivity as a process, a 'doing' that is at once
creative and critical]{.underline}. In contrast to the unifi ed Platonic
or Kantian subject, [[Deleuze paints a picture of identity as
decentered]{.mark}, distributed, [and emerging]{.mark} from a series of
highly [complex interactions]{.mark} between pre-personal
forces]{.underline}. The result is a subjectivity that is remarkably
similar to what Hayles describes as 'posthuman'. Crucially, [identity is
revealed not as an essence, but as 'an amalgam of heterogeneous
elements']{.underline} that include biological and evolutionary
processes, social and cultural codings, and accidents of history. The
forms that life takes and the particular individuals and identities that
arise are both determined to some extent and open to change or becoming
other than what they are at any given moment. The self must be made, but
it is always constituted in a context. This vision of subjectivity as
emerging out of a process of becoming is resolutely materialist. If we
have any doubt of this, we need only recall the source of the opposition
between being and becoming. In the Republic, Plato rejects Heraclitean
flux on the grounds that this material chaos, this becoming, obscures
the unchanging, non-material truth of the Forms (Plato 1991).9 In
Platonic terms, becoming is 'not real' and 'not true'. Its materiality,
its participation in the physical world of things and stuff and dirt and
bodies, makes it incompatible with truth. At best, it is an imperfect
representation of a 'pure' idea. [When Deleuze returns to becoming, he
returns to the founding moment of Western metaphysics and purposefully
unleashes all the mess and chaos of material flux]{.underline} that
Plato wanted to control by consigning it to 'mere representation'. This
vision of subjectivity remains remarkably consistent through Deleuze's
work with Guattari until his late essay 'Immanence: A Life . . .'. In
many ways, it anticipates much of the critical project of what I have
provisionally identifi ed as 'materialist' posthumanism. A better term
might be 'immanent' posthumanism. Deleuze's philosophical commitments
align him with those like Haraway and Hayles, for whom the critique of
subjectivity spans both the obviously 'material' (biological processes)
and the 'cultural' or 'social' codings that make identity intelligible.
Though they are not 'material' in a physical sense, neither are they
merely abstract nor transcendent, ahistorical truths. These [social and
cultural codings are always immanent to a particular situation or
environment.]{.underline} Subtly, for each of these thinkers, these
[cultural and social codings have 'real' -- that is, material --
effects]{.underline}. For Deleuze, as for Haraway and Hayles, [[an
immanent worldview]{.mark} that [takes into account]{.mark} a range of
[heterogeneous forces]{.mark} is [crucial to critiquing]{.mark} a form
of subjectivity]{.underline} that, for various reasons, they fi nd to be
inaccurate, distorting, and even oppressive. With this in mind, I would
like to return to the question of the body in Deleuze and Guattari's
work. [The main target of Deleuze and Guattari's critique]{.underline}
in Anti-Oedipus and A Thousand Plateaus [is [the]{.mark} same [logic of
identity that]{.mark}]{.underline} Deleuze fi rst targeted in Difference
and Repetition. This logic [[depends on a strict separation between self
and other]{.mark}, inside and outside, natural and unnatural, human and
machine, and human and animal]{.underline}, to name just a few. Deleuze
and Guattari systematically set about undermining this series of
oppositions. In doing so, [they repeatedly call into question the 'fact'
of a unified, contained subject]{.underline}. Traditionally, the
boundary of the subject is identified with the boundary of the flesh; I
end where my skin ends. This idea depends on a naturalized idea of the
body as 'given' and obvious. [Deleuze and Guattari, however, illustrate
how [the body must be constituted through 'codings']{.mark}, which are
[the result of]{.mark} the regulation, control, and [interactions of
various 'flows']{.mark}]{.underline}, including the biological,
technological, and cultural. In A Thousand Plateaus, [they use the
example of the face or 'faciality' to discuss how a surface, itself the
result of the convergence of a thousand tiny flows, is signified as
something]{.underline}, as someone (Deleuze and Guattari 1987: 167--73).
They ask us to be critical of the socially constructed, socially coded,
but naturalized face and the underlying logic of identity that supports
it. In doing so, they suggest that ['the body' is always more than its
biological parts or fleshy boundaries]{.underline}. By opening the body
beyond the limits of the fl esh, to include its social and cultural
codings, [[Deleuze]{.mark} and Guattari displace the body from what we
traditionally think of as the 'material' realm]{.underline}, that of
biology, [while precisely insisting on its materiality.]{.underline}
Braidotti clarifi es this seeming contradiction when she writes that:

The embodiedness of the subject is for Deleuze a form of bodily
materiality, not of the natural, biological kind. [He rather [takes the
body as the complex interplay of highly constructed social and symbolic
forces]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The body is]{.mark} not an
essence]{.underline}, let alone a biological substance; it [is a play of
forces[, **a surface of intensities**]{.mark}; pure simulacra without
originals]{.underline}. (Braidotti 1994: 112)

The 'material' is not merely the biological. There is a whole range of
forces that interact to form 'the body'. For Deleuze, these forces have
always been 'material'. Unlike Moravec, Deleuze and Guattari's machines
are not mobilized to do away with or escape materiality in a general
'becoming-machine'. Instead, as we have seen, 'becoming' has been, from
the beginning, an indice for the recognition of materiality and material
fl ux. At the same time, drawing on Deleuze's earlier ontological
analysis, [Deleuze and Guattari insistently undermine the boundary
between the organic and non-organic]{.underline}, the human and the
machine, the human and the animal. The blurring or elimination of these
boundaries has a strong relation to both forms of posthumanism that I
have outlined above. It might also seem to support a Moravecian merging
with machines. If there is no real difference between human and machine,
then what is lost in merging them? The phrase 'no real difference'
should be the fi rst indicator that something is wrong here. For Deleuze
and Guattari, [the [undermining of boundaries can never mean]{.mark}
that [there is no differen]{.mark}ce]{.underline}. Their point is more
complicated: **[[it is]{.mark} precisely [because there are too many
differences that]{.mark} these [simple binary oppositions are
insufficient]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In undermining the boundary between
man and machine, [Deleuze and Guattari do not aim to efface their
differences, but to reveal their interrelation and the fact that
'[calling into question the]{.mark} specific or personal [unity of the
organism]{.mark}']{.underline} [[and]{.mark} 'calling in question [the
structural unity of the machine']{.mark} [are part of the same
ontological critique]{.mark}]{.underline} (Deleuze and Guattari 1983:
284). Furthermore, in contrast to both a Moravecian posthumanism and
some of their own most ardent supporters, Deleuze and Guattari recognize
that there are material consequences of and limitations on our
experimentations. Deleuze may repeatedly insist on the Spinozistic
question, 'What can the body do?', but this does not mean that he
believes that the body can do just anything. His theory of forces and
intensities is firmly situated in what Hayles describes as 'the world of
energy and matter and the constraints they imply' (Hayles 1999: 236).
There is a signifi cant difference between asking what the body can do
and suggesting the body can do anything, or, recalling Moravec, doing
away with the body altogether. With this in mind, let us return to the
question of where Deleuze's work fi ts in the cyber theory and
posthumanist debates. [Deleuze's project, from beginning to end,
attempts to create a 'signifi cant shift in underlying assumptions about
subjectivity']{.underline}. Hayles, following Haraway, identifi es a
critique of the liberal humanist subject as a crucial feature of
posthumanism, and explicitly recognizes Deleuze and Guattari as being
engaged in a similar project (Hayles 1999: 4). Arguably, Deleuze takes
this project even further, by returning to the philosophical roots and
habits of thought that make a Lockean subject possible. In contrast,
Moravec's 'bubble of Mind' preserves key features of the dualist
subjectivity identifi ed with Plato and Enlightenment humanism, even as
it promises to evolve past the human. As Chris Land observes with
reference to Moravec's 'uploaded' brain, 'this fi gure of the post-human
is surprisingly like the ideal of the liberal-humanist subject.
Completely disembodied and obscenely rational, it is a pure will that
has finally cut itself free of its puppet strings to become a
self-contained master' (Land 2006: 122). Land has suggested the term
'transhumanism' as an alternative to distinguish a posthumanism that
both critiques the liberal humanist model of subjectivity and affi rms
materiality, from that of Moravec, Kurzweil, and other futurists (Land
2006: 113). Weinstone uses the term 'progressive posthumanism'.
Regardless of which term we prefer, what is clear is that Deleuze's
philosophical commitments align him with the strand of cyber theory and
posthumanism that not only insists [on a critique of subjectivity and a
thorough coming to terms with embodiment and materiality, but that also
sees these two tasks as intimately interconnected.]{.underline}

#### The logic of identity reflected in oedipalisation channels desire towards capital and is what allows for the reproduction of capitalist sovereignty. Oedipal representation individuates desire and creates psychic repression through conflation of social production with familial reproduction.

In particular, [it builds on Deleuze and Guattari's
[oedipalisation]{.mark} thesis, which offers crucial insights into the
complex configuration of capitalist subjects' desire]{.underline}, a
configuration of desire that makes political sovereignty a seemingly
inviolable institution in contemporary world order. The oedipalisation
thesis, advanced in Anti-Oedipus, departs from Freud's theorisation of
the Oedipus complex, the social operation that gives rise to human
sexuality. In contrast to Freud's view of the Oedipus complex as a
universal phenomenon, Deleuze and Guattari suggest [it [is a fictive
configuration of human desire that]{.mark} [capitalist]{.mark} social
[relations]{.mark} have successfully [inscribe]{.mark}d [in their
subjects]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is [[an internalised configuration of
desire]{.mark}, which [has allowed for]{.mark} the [maintenance of
social order as capitalism]{.mark} has ostensibly [liberated flows of
desire]{.mark} in the social economy.]{.underline}12 [[Through]{.mark}
the process of oedipalisation, of creating subjects whose
[desire]{.mark} is [channelled by an unconscious paranoia of violating
the law of Oedipus]{.mark}, [an acephalous regime of capital has been
able to preserve]{.mark} the [conditions necessary for]{.mark} its
[reproduction]{.mark}.]{.underline} By extension, this article suggests
that [oedipalisation is a process that helps to potentiate modern
political sovereignty, which]{.underline}, along the lines of the
theorisation advanced by political Marxism, [is indelibly linked to the
expansion of capitalist property relations.]{.underline}13
Schizoanalysis, as we shall see, interrogates the notion of
subjectivity, of the productive individual, through which capitalist
sovereignty, defined by the division of public and private spheres,
manifests itself. [Subjectivity for Deleuze and Guattari is not premised
on the Cartesian Cogito but rather on a Lacanian view of a radically
decentred and fragmented subject.]{.underline}14 Their schizoanalytic
approach helps not only to understand the divisions and fragmented
nature of the modern political economic subject, but also to explore the
specific configuration of subjectivity which is mutually productive with
capitalist sovereignty. [This configuration, as we shall see, is one
which is formed out of the repressive structuring of the unconscious
into a theatre playing out the drama of Oedipus within capitalism's
subjects.]{.underline} Building on the contributions of political
Marxism, [this analysis deploys schizoanalysis to reveal the unique
[libidinal configuration of subjectivity]{.mark} that [gives trenchant
expression to capitalist sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline}. It looks to
reveal the unconscious and non-rational forces that foment capitalist
sovereignty's day-to-day reproduction. Journal of International
Relations and Development Taking up the method of schizoanalysis, [we
come to better understand [the psychical economy]{.mark} which gives
rise to the law of Oedipus, and in turn [supports]{.mark} the
[reproduction of capitalist sovereignty]{.mark}.]{.underline}15 This
method highlights the unconscious aspect of the desire that coexists
with and overdetermines social production. Like Freud, [rather than
treating the unconscious as secondary to the workings of the rational
and functionalist dynamic of conscious social life, [D]{.mark}eleuze
[and]{.mark} [G]{.mark}uattari [look to the unconscious as the seat of
all social production]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The unconscious is not, as
commonly characterised, the realm of repressed thought.]{.underline}16
[Nor is the unconscious some force external to a nuts-andbolts reality,
or simply an aleatory factor in social production that manifests itself
in slips of the tongue.]{.underline} For schizoanalysis, [[it
is]{.mark}, as Holland points out, '[the unconscious]{.mark} rather than
conscious "intention" [that constitutes reality']{.mark}]{.underline}
(Holland 1999: 23). This follows Freud's own assertion that the
unconscious is the larger sphere of psychical life, which includes
within it the smaller conscious sphere. The 'unconscious is the true
psychical reality; in its innermost nature it is as much unknown to us
as the reality of the external world, and it is as incompletely
presented by the data of consciousness as is the external world by the
communications of our sense organs' (Freud 1964b: 612--3, emphasis
original). Thus, [[schizoanalysis views the conscious dimension of
social life as the site for the negotiation of the unconscious drives of
desiring production]{.mark}, a 'theatre' of representation within a
broader libidinal economy.]{.underline} Anti-Oedipus The approach of
schizoanalysis is largely revealed to us in Anti-Oedipus. Though the
approach is informed by psychoanalysis, particularly Freud's
theorisation of libidinal drives and investments, as well as his
understanding of the unconscious, it is nonetheless highly critical of
his generalisation of the Oedipus complex as a universal configuration
for inscribing sexuality. [Schizoanalysis is also critical of the
normalising role historically played by psychoanalysis with its focus on
Oedipal neuroses.]{.underline} Rather than beginning their radical
programme with the neurotic, who Freud generally conceived to be within
the bounds of treatment (normalcy), Deleuze and Guattari take as their
inspiration the rebellion of the schizophrenic, a subject beyond the
reach of psychoanalytic treatment, and, who in their view, resists the
language that binds together the libidinal configuration of capitalist
production. The Oedipus complex, as Freud outlines, is the decisive
factor in forging the connection between the ego of the subject and the
social group. It brings into creation that psychical agency which he
referred to as the super-ego, which compels the subject to identify with
others. The super-ego, for Freud, is the preserve of the inter-psychical
economy that makes civilisation possible. The Oedipus complex is unique
to humans among the animals. It marks a disruption in humans' biological
sexual development, whereby they inscribe their sexuality in a socially
determined pattern through the identification with a parental figure
during childhood. For Freud, the Oedipus complex was so fundamental that
the subject's ability to resolve this complex in childhood was
determinant of its successful integration into the social group. For
their part, [Deleuze and Guattari did not accuse Freud of fabricating
the Oedipus complex, but were critical of his failure to properly
historicise it.]{.underline} In his Totem and Taboo, Freud hypothesises
a primordial conflict in sexual relations at the dawn of humanity that
gave rise to the Oedipus complex, and which he also implicates in the
rise of religion and ethics.17 Though Deleuze and Guattari would agree
that ethics and religion are ultimately reflective of an underlying
libidinal configuration of subjectivity, [the Oedipus complex was, in
their view, a configuration specific to the libidinal configuration of
capitalism.]{.underline} While rejecting the universality of the Oedipus
complex, Deleuze and Guattari believed that Freud had struck upon
something. Sophocles' tale of Oedipus Rex, the king who unknowingly
killed his own father and appropriated his throne, who married his
mother and fathered her children, was a tragedy seen to resonate with
the desires and anxieties of capitalism's subjects. [Like Oedipus, who
blinded himself upon discovering the crime he unwittingly committed,
[the capitalist subject harbours]{.mark} an [immense guilt that
induces]{.mark} a form of [self-castigation]{.mark}.]{.underline}18
[[The capitalist subject maintains a costly ascetic ideal]{.mark} in
order [to atone for its 'illicit' desires]{.mark}]{.underline}. But
whereas Oedipus becomes conscious of his crime, the capitalist subject
remains unaware of its desires. [The unconscious recognition of this
incestuous desire, though, and [the need to prevent conscious awareness
of this desire]{.mark}, [fuels]{.mark} the necessary [psychic
repression]{.mark} [that allows the smooth flow of]{.mark} commodities
and money of [capitalist]{.mark} social [relations]{.mark}.]{.underline}
The Oedipus complex is not actually repressing a real desire. For
Deleuze and Guattari the process of oedipalisation, of creating Oedipal
subjects, is a 'factitious production of psychic repression' (Deleuze
and Guattari 2000: 115). [[Desire]{.mark} within social production
[is]{.mark} something which is engineered, something [cultivated in the
individual to enlist her or him in the]{.mark} preservation of the
[prevailing mode of production]{.mark}.]{.underline} 'The schizoanalytic
argument is simple: [desire is a machine, a synthesis of machines, a
machinic arrangement --- desiring machines']{.underline} (ibid.: 296).19
[[The Oedipus complex]{.mark}, thus, [is a specific machinic arrangement
that cultivates an obstructed desire]{.mark}.]{.underline} This
artificial desire in turn reinforces a specific regime of familial
identifications. It coaxes desire towards differentiated parental
figures --- of mother and father, and at the same time prohibits the
satisfaction or realisation of this desire. [[Oedipal desires]{.mark} do
not spring from the unconscious directly, to be subsequently repressed;
rather, they [are created by the]{.mark} very [act of the repression of
undifferentiated desire]{.mark}]{.underline}. 'If desire is repressed,
this is not because it is desire for the mother and for the death of the
father; on the contrary, desire becomes that only because it is
repressed, it takes on that mask only under the reign of the repression
that models the mask for it and plasters it on its face' (ibid.: 116).
At the same time that this desire is created through repression, it is
obstructed by the [[threat of symbolic castration]{.underline}]{.mark},
understood as the dissolution of identity, the disintegration of
subjectivity[. It is this threat that compels acquiescence to paternal
authority and [fosters identification with the simulacrum of the
father]{.mark}, [helping]{.mark} to [ensure the reproduction of Oedipal
authority through capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline} This Oedipal
configuration of sexuality comes to permeate all aspects of social
production. For Deleuze and Guattari, as for Freud, sexuality is much
broader than genital sexuality. What is called sexuality is 'by no means
identical with the impulsion towards a union of the two sexes or towards
producing a pleasurable sensation in the genitals', Freud tells us,
having 'far more resemblance to the all-inclusive and all-preserving
Eros of Plato's Symposium' (Freud 1961: 218). Thus, our language, our
institutions, all the sundry objects that constitute our social
existence, are libidinally invested. 'The truth is that sexuality is
everywhere: the way a bureaucrat fondles his records, a judge
administers justice, a businessman causes money to circulate; the way
the bourgeoisie fucks the proletariat' (Deleuze and Guattari 2000: 293).
[Oedipal sexuality, in particular, sees the simulacra of father and the
mother conveyed in every aspect of social life, every social
role]{.underline}, the land, labour, private property, money, etc.20 It
is 'applied to everything, in that [the [agents and relations of social
production]{.mark}, and the libidinal investments corresponding to them,
[are made to conform to the figures of familial
reproduction]{.mark}']{.underline} (ibid.: 101). So too, Oedipal guilt
acts not only as a disciplinary force in individuals, but also helps to
invigilate the behaviour of the social group. As Schrift tells us,
Oedipal guilt works in a fashion similar to the condition of bad
conscience that Nietzsche sees beleaguering 'stable' and 'peaceful'
societies. Like bad conscience, [the complex leads to the
self-repression of an illicit desire, and, at the same time, there is
the paranoiac projection of this guilt onto the social
other]{.underline} (Schrift 1995: 78; Dudley 2002: 132). Thus, quite
distinct from the reading of Marx, [Deleuze and Guattari suggest that
what makes capitalism a unique form of social production is not
commodity exchange relations per se; rather, it is the unconscious
machinic of Oedipus that upholds these relations]{.underline}. In
Capital, Marx proposes an answer to the question of equivalence posed by
Aristotle in Nicomachean Ethics, the question over the source of
commensurability that allows us to formulate that 5 beds ¼ 1 house, or 5
beds ¼ a quantity of money. The general equivalent of any two
exchangeable goods, Marx (1990: 151) argues, is the quantity of abstract
labour that goes into producing these commodities. But in order for
labour to be abstracted from the particular goods that it produces, and
then for it to be generalised or universalised through money, Marx
(1993: 149--50) argues that it is force that is necessary. Whereas Marx
(1990: 873) locates this force in the wellspring of primitive
accumulation, which he claims is akin to political economy's 'original
sin', for Deleuze and Guattari it is the crime of Oedipus that marks the
beginnings of capitalism. [The [alienation of the worker from his labour
is]{.mark} not under compunction of physical force or deprivation alone,
but [the internalisation of the law of the father that sanctifies this
separation]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Oedipal representation binds the death-instinct to the despotic signifier of capitalism through a negative desire that produces surplus value. Distinctions between production and anti-production have disappeared -- even the death enterprise absorbs surplus value now. Zombie commodification has produced a capitalist dreamland that ties us to an endless loop of desire for commodities and war. Only schizoanalysis can undermine blockages that keep us captivated to the simulacrum of image commodification and technologies of desire

[Deleuze and Guattari will question this deep wisdom of [Freud's anemic
Ananke]{.mark} (Necessity) that [binds desire in a weltering world of
voidic cholera]{.mark}]{.underline}: "Is this really the right way to
bring on better days? And aren't all the destructions performed by
schizoanalysis worth more than this psychoanalytical conservatory,
aren't they more a part of the affirmative task?" (p. 334) In fact [they
will see in this claustrophobic science of the mind, an Oedipal mind, a
dark theatre of cruelty the habitation of ghosts and interior palaces
where desire is brought to bare for its crimes]{.underline}, a sadistic
chamber where Freud can observe the guilt of the past in all its
terrible splendor. Instead of this dark cave Deleuze and Guattari will
say, open the doors, let in a little fresh air and give us a "bit of a
relation to the outside, a little real reality" (p. 334).

Freud was the first to link death and war as he studied the aftermath of
WWI; a linkage between psychoanalysis and capitalism in their twin
engagement with death and war. (p. 335) "What [we have tried to show
apropos of capitalism is how it inherited much from a transcendent
death-carrying agency, the despotic signifier]{.underline}, but also how
it brought about this agency's effusion in the full immanence of its own
system: [[the]{.mark} [full body]{.mark}, having become that of
capital-money, suppresses the distinction between production and
anti-production]{.underline}; [everywhere it [mixes anti-production
with]{.mark} the [productive forces in the immanent reproduction of its
own always widened limits]{.mark}]{.underline}. The death enterprise
(war) is one of the principle and specific forms of the absorption of
surplus value in capitalism. (p. 335) [What Freud discovers is that [the
death-instinct]{.mark} being [immanent to the capitalist despotic
signifier]{.mark}, the empty locus around which its system of absorption
exists]{.underline}, that [it [must displace everything into this
war-machine to block]{.mark} the [schizophrenic escapes]{.mark} and
place restraints on its flights]{.underline}. (p. 335)
[[Capitalism]{.mark} is a war machine that [binds desire within its own
immanent logic as death]{.mark}: a negative desire that produces pure
surplus-value out of the hell of its despotic and ascetic
cult.]{.underline}

It is at this point that they will introduce Zombie Capitalism: the
"only modern myth is the myth of zombies -- [mortified schizos, good for
work, brought back to reason" by the psychoanalytical priest of a new
asceticism so that they can continue serving the
war-machine]{.underline} like good subservient capitalists. (p. 335) [It
is the [principle of death immanent to capitalism]{.mark} that produces
the very limits that bind and [impose a gap between
social-]{.mark}production [and desiring-production]{.mark} [that
keeps]{.mark} the [zombies tied to the endless loop of a false desire
for commodities and war]{.mark}]{.underline}. "Now [this universe has as
its function the splitting of the subjective essence into two functions,
that of abstract labor alienated in private property that reproduces the
ever wider limits, and that of abstract desire alienated in the
privatized family that displaces the ever narrower internalized
limits]{.underline}" (p. 337).

[In this system caught between abstract labor and desire [the zombie
citizen lives under]{.mark} a mortuary axiomatic: [an axiomatic of
simulacra]{.mark}, wherein the [zombies cannibalize images instead of
flesh]{.mark}]{.underline}: "death is not desires, but what is desired
is dead" (p. 337) In truth, [capitalism has nothing to co-opt; or
rather, its powers of co-option coexist more often than not with what is
to be co-opted]{.underline}, and even anticipate it. (p. 338) For those
that remember Debord's Society of the Spectacle all this will seem
familiar. In Debord's theory, [media have become the quintessential tool
of contemporary capitalism, and consumerism is its legitimating
ideology]{.underline}. Or, to cite Debord's famous quip, "[[the
spectacle is capital accumulated to the point where it becomes
image]{.underline}]{.mark}."2 What is crucial about Debord's theory is
that it connects the state's investment in social reproduction to its
commitment to, "and control of, the field of images--- the alternative
world conjured up by the new battery of 'perpetual emotion machines' of
which TV was the dim pioneer and which now beckons the citizen every
waking minute." Not only is the world of images a structural necessity
for capitalism, it affirms the primacy of the pedagogical as a crucial
element of the political. It enforces "the submission of more and more
facets of human sociability--- areas of everyday life, forms of
recreation, patterns of speech, idioms of local solidarity . . . to the
deadly solicitation (the lifeless bright sameness) of the market."
(Giroux KL 517-523)

Under contemporary capitalism, [[state-sanctioned violence makes its
mark through]{.mark} the [prisons]{.mark}, [courts,]{.mark} police
[surveillance]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} other criminalizing
forces]{.underline}; [it also [wages]{.mark} a form of [symbolic warfare
mediated by]{.mark} a regime of [consumer-based images]{.mark} and
staged events [that]{.mark} narrow individual and social [agency to
the]{.mark} dictates of the [marketplace]{.mark}]{.underline}, reducing
the capacity for human aspirations and desires to needs embodied in the
appearance of the commodity. In Debord's terms, "[the spectacle is the
bad dream of modern society in chains, expressing nothing more than its
wish for sleep]{.underline}." (Giroux KL 526) What Debord would term the
politics of consent is the acknowledgement that [all aspects of social
life are increasingly shaped by the communication technologies under the
control of corporate forces.]{.underline}

Of course this is even more so in our own time, when [technologies of
[communication]{.mark}]{.underline} have become not only ubiquitous and
invisible due to normalization, they [actually [replace reality]{.mark}
with a surfeit of image, propaganda, and ideological constructs that
seem to be more real than reality itself]{.underline}. As Giroux and
Evans will affirm:

Debord did not anticipate either the evolution of media along its
current trajectories, with its multiple producers, distributors, and
access, or the degree to which the forces of militarization would
dominate all aspects of society, especially in the United States, where
obsession with law enforcement, surveillance, and repression of dissent
has at least equaled cultural emphasis on commercialization from 9/ 11
forward. The economic, political, and social safeguards of a past era,
however limited, along with traditional spatial and temporal coordinates
of experience, have been blown apart in the "second media age," as the
spectacularization of anxiety and fear and the increasing militarization
of everyday life have become the principal cultural experiences shaping
identities, values, and social relations. (Giroux KL 600-606)

Following Deleuze and Guattari [[we should affirm]{.mark} both a
destructive and constructive task incorporating [schizoanalytical
technics in becoming mechanics rather than a theatre
director]{.mark}]{.underline}: the political and social unconscious is
not an archaeology, there are no statues in this unconscious: there are
"only stones to be sucked ... and other machinic elements belonging to
deterritorialized constellations" (p. 338). As they would tell us in
"the unconscious it is not the lines of pressure that matter, but on the
contrary the lines of escape" (p. 338). To seek out those constellations
of resistance and revolt, [those ["lines of]{.mark} escape" and
[flight]{.mark} that will help us to [open gaps]{.mark} and cracks
[in]{.mark} the current system of [capitalism and its death
machine]{.mark}]{.underline}, this is the task today.

Against all representational theories that seek to interpret the
socio-cultural, political, and economic unconscious we must realize that
[[the]{.mark} very [images that interpretation entails are the]{.mark}
very [tools of repression and death]{.mark}]{.underline}, the ascetic
priests tools of choice that enslave and bind rather than uncover and
liberate or emancipate the break-flows of desire. Instead of a cinematic
or video game existence flicking by in synthetic-time frames,
encapsulated in the violence of freeze-frame abstractions that present
the surface textures of a symbolic existence caught in the imaginary of
capital, [an a-life of [artificial extractions]{.mark} that [confine
flesh to a screen of repetition and loss]{.mark} rather than the
break-flows of real time existence]{.underline}. This half-life in which
[we are bound to an interface existence, caught up in [the flows of
death machines]{.mark} that [trap and bind us to a ghost-land of
sound-scapes and images]{.mark}]{.underline}. "It is the very form of
interpretation that shows itself to be incapable of attaining the
unconscious, since it gives rise to the inevitable illusions ... by
means of which the conscious makes of the unconscious an image consonant
with its wishes: we are still pious, psychoanalysis remains in the
pre-critical age" (p. 339). [[We must break through this]{.mark} crystal
palace [dreamland of capital]{.mark}, [discover lines of escape beyond
its illusory fun house]{.mark} of gadgets and technological toys, [else
be entrapped forever]{.mark} in a void of commoditized identities,
[spinning in a self-voided paradise of Oedipal
madness]{.mark}]{.underline} where we finally merge with our very
machinic lives -- [[our flesh dissolving in]{.mark} the
[war-machines]{.mark} that have now become our only
reality.]{.underline}

Ultimately [the [schizoanalytical technique unbinds the repressive
Oedipal system of capital that has tied it to the death machines of
production and zombie commodification]{.mark}]{.underline}, [the
compulsion to repeat an endless cycle of negative desire in a void of
surplus-value profiting that sucks the life-blood out of the human waste
expended]{.underline} and multiplied by this vast charnel house system.
Instead of falling back into the trap of capitalist repression and
re-Oedipalization, [schizoanalysis "follows the lines of escape and the
machinic indices all the way to the desiring-machines"]{.underline} (p.
339). Or, as they tell us:

undoing the blockage or the coincidence on which the repression properly
speaking relies; transforming the apparent opposition of repulsion ...
into a condition of real functioning; ensuring this functioning in the
forms of attraction and attractive functioning, as well as enveloping
the zero degree in the intensities produced; and thereby causing the
desiring-machines to start up again. Such is the delicate and focal
point that fills the function of transference in schizoanalysis --
dispersing, schizophrenizing the perverse transference of
psychoanalysis.(p. 339)

For a social and political task [one must take this and apply it to the
repressive blockages within the capitalist system that keep the zombies
bound and captivated to the simulacrum of image commodification and
technologies of desire, providing [an alternative]{.mark} to this
death-machine zero]{.underline} sum world of capital; [one that
[allows]{.mark} a [transference]{.mark} from this illusory image-world
of capital [to a world where desiring-machines are no longer]{.mark}
formed]{.underline}, mutilated, [and [bound to]{.mark} a [negative
desire situated in capital]{.mark} and its war-machines]{.underline}.
[We need [a critical praxis]{.mark} that is]{.underline} not a reversion
to pre-critical forms, but is [[worthy of]{.mark} the
[anti-representational critique]{.mark} developed by Deleuze & Guattari,
one that seeks out in the functional blockages in the political,
economic, and socio-cultural unconscious]{.underline} the part-objects
that enforce its repressive stasis and violence of passivity and
captures the desiring flows of surplus-joissance, [all the while
[seeking lines of]{.mark} escape and [flight out of this zombie
globalist system of capital]{.mark}]{.underline}. Seeking cracks in the
molecular fabric that encapsulates us in what that liberal-conservative
Sloterdijk calls the "World Interior of Capital"; [that illusionary
ideological construct that is so pervasive and ubiquitous that it has
become normalized to the point of invisibility]{.underline}, the
Infosphere.

#### Thus we advocate for the nomadic war machine as a space of radical dislocation and resistance against power.

#### The nomadic war machine frees thought from binary structures and opens up a space characterized by multiplicity and difference. Embracing a philosophy of immanence is a prerequisite for any alternative -- humanist subjectivity ties desire to the State and prevents resistance through self-complicity

It is this [undermining of Enlightenment humanist ontology that allows
poststructuralists like Deleuze to see politics in an entirely new
way]{.underline}. Like [Stirner, Deleuze sees the human subject to be an
effect of power rather than an essential and autonomous
identity.]{.underline} [Subjectivity is constructed in such a way that
its desire becomes the desire for the State]{.underline}. According to
Deleuze, [[the State]{.mark}, where it once operated through a massive
repressive apparatus]{.underline}, now no longer needs this --- it
[[functions through]{.mark} the [self-domination of the
subject]{.mark}.]{.underline} The subject becomes his own legislator: .
. . [[the more you obey the statements of dominant reality]{.mark},
**[the more you command as speaking subject within mental
reality]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [for finally you' only obey
yourself]{.underline}. . . A new form of slavery has been invented,
**[that of being a slave to oneself]{.underline}**. . . (Deleuze and
Guattari 1988:162) 10 For Deleuze [[desire is channelled to the State
through]{.mark} our willing [submission to Oedipal
representation]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Oedipus is the State's defence
against untrammelled desire]{.underline} (Deleuze 1987:88). In fact
[Deleuze sees psychoanalysis as the new church, the new altar upon which
we sacrifice ourselves]{.underline}, no longer to God but to Oedipus.
Psychoanalysts are "the last priests" (Deleuze 1987:81). So, while for
Stirner the religion of the State is humanism and humanist Man, for
Deleuze the religion of the State is Oedipus. [[Oedipal
representation]{.mark} does not repress desire as such, but rather
[constructs]{.mark} [it]{.mark} [in]{.mark} such [a way that it believes
itself to be repressed]{.mark}, to be based on a negativity, guilt and
lack]{.underline} (Deleuze and Guattari 1977:116). Thus Oedipal
repression is simply the mask for the real domination of desire[.
[Desire is 'repressed']{.mark} in this way [because unfettered it is a
threat to the State]{.mark}]{.underline} --- it is essentially
revolutionary: ". . . [there is no desiring machine capable of being
assembled without demolishing entire social sectors]{.underline}"
(Deleuze and Guattari 1977:116). Deleuze argues that [[Oedipus
individualises]{.mark} this [desire by cutting it off from]{.mark} its
possible [connections and imprisoning it within the individual
subject]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is much in the same way that for
Stirner the essential human subject imprisons the ego, trying to capture
its pluralities and fluxes within a single concept. The question of
desire plays a crucial role in both Deleuze and Stirner's political
thinking, and I would argue that it is impossible to understand their
radical approach to politics without a consideration of this concept.
For these thinkers [we can desire our own domination, just as we can
desire freedom.]{.underline} Deleuze says: To the question 'How can
desire desire its own repression, how can it desire its slavery?' we
reply that [[the powers which crush desire]{.mark}, or which subjugate
it, themselves already [form part of the assemblages of
desire]{.mark}]{.underline}:. . . (Deleuze 1987:133) For Stirner
similarly, **[[desire is]{.mark} not repressed or denied --- rather it
is [channelled to the State]{.mark}]{.underline}**: "The State exerts
itself to tame the desirous Man; in other words, it seeks to direct his
desire to it alone, and to content that desire with what it offers"
(Stirner 1993:312). So for Stirner desire is constituted in such a way
that it becomes desire for the State. In this way [[State domination is
made possible through]{.mark} our [complicity]{.mark} --- through our
desire for authority]{.underline} (Stirner 1993:312). Like Deleuze,
Stirner is not so much interested in power itself, but in the reasons
why we allow ourselves to be dominated by power. He wants to study the
ways in which we participate in our own oppression, and to show that
power is not only concerned with economic or political questions --- it
is also rooted in psychological needs. It has embedded itself, in the
form of abstract ideas such as the State, human essence and morality,
deep within our conscience. The dominance of the State, Stirner argues,
depends on our willingness to let it dominate us: The State is not
thinkable without lordship and servitude (subjection); for the State
must will to be lord of all that it embraces, and this will is called
the 'will of the State'. 'He who, to hold his own, must count on the
absence of will in others is a thing made by these others, as a master
is a thing made by the servant. If submissiveness ceased, it would be
all over with lordship. (Stirner 1993:195--6) Stirner argues that [the
State itself is essentially an abstraction: it only exists because we
allow it to exist and because we abdicate to it our own
authority]{.underline}, 11 in the same way that we create God by
abdicating our authority and placing it outside ourselves. What is more
important than the institution of the State is the "ruling principle"
--- it is the idea of the State that oppresses us (Stirner 1993:226).
The State's power is really based on our power. Would the State be as
dominant if one refused to obey it, if one refused to surrender his
authority to it? Is it not undeniable that any kind of rule depends on
our willingness to let it rule us? Political power cannot rest solely on
coercion. It needs our help, our willingness to obey. It is only because
the individual has not recognised this power, because he humbles himself
before the sacred, before authority, that the State continues to exist
(Stirner 1993:284). So for both Stirner and Deleuze **[[the State must
be overcome as an idea before it can be overcome in
reality]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This [is the only way to ensure that a
new State does not spring up in the place of the old.]{.underline} This
was also the central concern of anarchism. However, according to this
argument, classical anarchism failed to adequately account for the
problem of power, subjectivity and desire. As Stirner and Deleuze have
shown, not only is [[State power]{.underline}]{.mark} linked to moral
and rational discourses, it [[is]{.mark} also **fundamentally [linked
with the idea of the]{.mark} autonomous [humanist
subject]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- the cornerstone of anarchist thought.
What the classical anarchists did not foresee was the subtle complicity
between the desiring subject and the power that oppresses him/her. This
is the spectre that haunts revolutionary theory. So Stirner and Deleuze
go beyond the problematic of classical anarchism by unmasking the links
between human essence and power, and by recognising the authoritarian
possibilities of desire. It is clear then that [resistance against State
power must work along different lines to those envisaged by classical
anarchists]{.underline}. 4 Resistance So for both Stirner and Deleuze,
[State domination operates through]{.underline}, not only social
contract theories and moral and rational discourses, but more
fundamentally through [humanist desire itself.]{.underline} The question
must be how, if we are so intricately tied to the State, do we resist
its domination? For Stirner and Deleuze, [[resistance to the State must
take place at]{.mark} the level of our thoughts, ideas and most
fundamentally our [desires]{.mark}]{.underline}. We must learn to think
beyond the paradigm of the State. Revolutionary action in the past has
failed because it has remained trapped within this paradigm. Even
revolutionary philosophies like anarchism, which have as their aim the
destruction of State power, have remain trapped within essentialist
concepts and manichean structures which, as Stirner and Deleuze have
shown, often end up reaffirming authority. Perhaps the very idea of
revolution should be abandoned. Perhaps politics should be about
escaping essentialist structures and identities. Stirner argues, for
instance, that resistance against the State should take the form, not of
revolution, but "insurrection": Revolution and insurrection must not be
looked upon as synonymous. The former consists in an overturning of
conditions, of the established condition or status, the State or
society, and is accordingly a political or social act; the latter has
indeed for its unavoidable consequence a transformation of
circumstances, yet does not start from it but from men's discontent with
themselves, is not an armed rising but a rising of individuals, a
getting up without regard to the 12 arrangements that spring from it.
The Revolution aimed at new arrangements; insurrection leads us no
longer to let ourselves be arranged, but to arrange ourselves, and sets
no glittering hopes on 'institutions'. It is not a fight against the
established, since, if it prospers, the established collapses of itself;
it is only a working forth of me out of the established. (Stirner
1993:316) Insurrection, it may be argued, starts with the individual
refusing his enforced identity, the 'I' through which power operates: it
starts 'from men's discontent with themselves.' Moreover Stirner says
that [[insurrection]{.mark} does not aim at overthrowing political
institutions themselves. It [is aimed at the individual overthrowing his
own identity]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [the outcome of which is,
nevertheless, a change in political arrangements]{.underline}.
Insurrection is therefore not about becoming what one 'is' according to
humanism --- becoming human, becoming Man --- but about becoming what
one is not. Stirner's [notion of [rebellion involves a process of
becoming]{.mark} --- it is about continually reinventing one's own
self.]{.underline} The self is not an essence, a defined set of
characteristics, but rather an emptiness, a "creative nothing", and it
is up to the individual to create something out of this and not be
limited by essences (Stirner 1993:150). [Deleuze as we have seen also
rejects the unity and essentialism of subject, seeing it as a structure
that constrains desire]{.underline}. He too sees becoming --- becoming
other than Man, other than human --- as a form of resistance. [He
proposes a notion of subjectivity which privileges multiplicity,
plurality and difference over unity, and flux over the stability and
essentialism of identity.]{.underline} The unity of the subject is
broken down into a series of flows, connections, and assemblages of
heterogeneous parts (Bogue 1989:94). One cannot even think of the body
as unified: we are composed of different parts that may function quite
independently. What is important is not the subject or the various
components themselves, but rather what happens between components:
connections, flows, etc (Bogue 1989:91). So for Deleuze and Stirner,
**[[resistance against the State must]{.mark} involve a
[reject]{.mark}ion of [unified]{.mark} [and essentialist
identities]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- [identities [which tie
desire]{.mark}, language and thought [to the State]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Their breaking down of unity into plurality, difference and becoming may
be seen as an exercise in anti-authoritarian, anti-State thought. It may
be seen as an attempt to go beyond existing political categories and to
invent new ones --- to expand the field of politics beyond its present
limits by unmasking the connections that can be formed between
resistance and the power being resisted. As Deleuze says: "You may make
a rupture, draw a line of flight, yet there is still a danger that you
will restratify everything, formations that restore power to a
signifier,. . . " (Deleuze and Guattari 1988:9). Perhaps one way to
think outside this binary, essentialist logic is through the concept of
war. Stirner and [Deleuze, in different ways, theorise non-essentialist
forms of resistance against the State in terms of war]{.underline}.
Stirner calls for war to be declared on the very institution and
principle of the State. Moreover, he sees society in terms of a war of
egos, a kind of Hobbesian war of "all against all" in which there is no
appeal to any notion of collectivity or unity (Clark 1976:93). For this
he has often been accused of advocating a selfish and extreme
individualism in which "might is right" and the individual is entitled
to all that he has it within his power to attain. However I would argue
that Stirner is not talking here about actual war but rather a struggle
at the level of representations which creates radical theoretical
openings and in which all essential unities and collectivities are
ruptured. War for Stirner is not a State of nature or an essential 13
characteristic. Rather it is a mode of thinking that undermines essence.
It is in the same vein that Deleuze talks about [the 'war machine' as a
figure of resistance against the State. [The war machine constitutes an
outside to the State]{.mark}.]{.underline} While the State is
characterised by interiority, [the war machine is characterised by
absolute exteriority]{.underline}. [[While the State
is]{.underline}]{.mark}, as we have seen, [[a coded conceptual plane
confining thought within binary structures]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[the
war machine is sheer nomadic movement]{.mark}, non-striated and
uncoded]{.underline}**. [[It is a space]{.mark} characterised by
pluralities, multiplicities and difference, [which escapes Statecoding
by eschewing binary structures]{.mark}]{.underline} (Deleuze 1987:141).
The war machine is the State's Outside --- whatever escapes the State's
capture: 'just as Hobbes saw clearly that the State was against war, so
war is against the State and makes it impossible' (Deleuze and Guattari
1988:359). It is the conceptual absence of essence and central
authority. Again I would argue that [Deleuze, as was the case with
Stirner, is not talking here about actual war, but rather a theoretical
terrain characterised by conceptual openness to plurality and
difference]{.underline}, which eschews the stable identities, essences
and conceptual unities that form part of the assemblage of the State.
[The idea of [war as a radical dislocation]{.mark} and constitutive
emptiness [may be]{.mark} developed in this way, as [a tool of
resistance against State power]{.mark} and authority]{.underline}. As we
have seen, [resistance is a dangerous enterprise: it can always be
colonised by the power it opposes.]{.underline} It can no longer be seen
as the overthrowing of State power by an essential revolutionary
subject. [Resistance may now be seen in terms of war]{.underline}: a
field of multiple struggles, strategies, localised tactics, temporary
setbacks and betrayals --- [ongoing antagonism without the promise of a
final victory.]{.underline} As Deleuze says: ". . . the world and its
States are no more masters of their plane than revolutionaries are
condemned to a deformation of theirs. Everything is played in uncertain
games. . . " (Deleuze 1987:147). How does this notion of resistance as
war, as an uncertain game played between individuals, collectivities and
authority differ from the anarchist idea of revolution? For classical
anarchists revolution was a grand, dialectical overturning of society,
in which structures of power and authority would be overthrown and the
last obstacle to the full realisation of the subject's humanity would be
removed. For Deleuze and Stirner, on the other hand, [resistance does
not have a conclusion or telos in this sense. [Resistance is]{.mark}
seen as [an ongoing confrontation]{.mark} ' a perpetual war of attrition
in which the lines of confrontation are never marked out in advance but
are rather constantly renegotiated and fought over.]{.underline}
Resistance against the State is an uncertain game precisely because
[[State power]{.mark} can longer be circumscribed in a single
institution but rather is something that [pervades the social
fabric]{.mark}]{.underline}, constituting, as we have seen, desires,
essences and rational principles. The very notion of the moral and
rational human subject which is pitted against State power in anarchist
discourse, is constructed, or at least infiltrated, by this very power
that it purportedly opposes. So resistance is an uncertain game played
by individuals and groups engaged in day to day struggles with multiple
forms of domination.

#### Their Socratic dialectic denies the constant flux of reality and transforms debaters into bureaucratic subjects- "deliberative dialogue" only maintains a cycle of suffering and commodifies debate as a space of manufactured dream worlds- only a Heraclitean vision exposes the unreality of our existence without masking Dionysian forces

The distinctive feature of [[the Heraclitean dialectical vision is the
perception]{.mark} of reality as having no rational]{.underline} (that
is, causal, functional, meaningful) [foundation or given
order]{.underline}, which could be discovered by reason or science. The
Heraclitean dialectical view in sociology implies that [the social
world]{.underline}, with its orders, identities and inequalities, [is
studied as a 'fearful, evil, enigmatic, destructive, disastrous' flux of
passing phenomena, which has neither order, law or form]{.underline}
(Nietzsche 2000: 7). **[[The world moves in a dialectic between opposite
things that transform reality]{.mark} in their confrontation with each
other]{.underline}**. Opposites, which sociologists have grasped in
ideas like self and other, bourgeois and citoyen, labor and capital,
culture and industry, local and cosmopolitan, antiquity and modernity,
and myth and enlightenment, are related to each other in a very
ambiguous manner. They are [namely contraries that struggle against each
other, and yet, at the same time, they are driven towards each other,
because they ultimately belong to each other]{.underline} (Bloch 1983:
284; Dienstag 2001: 936). This is the tragic story of hero who fights
against his fate, knowing that the inevitable will happen, and who,
therefore, actually precipitates or realizes his lot. It is the union
between opposite forces -- the restoration of 'the original Unity',
according to Nietzsche (2000: 30) -- which ensures the ephemeral periods
of cultural flourishing (Seaford 2003: 156-159). Georg Simmel is one of
the very few sociologists who, inspired by Nietzsche, assume the
Heraclitean dialectic of opposite forces in their reconstruction of
social reality. The dialectical sociology of men like Max Horkheimer,
Theodor Adorno, C. Wright Mills and Alvin Gouldner, on the other hand,
is not Heraclitean but Socratic. [Their sociology is based on [the
understanding of reality]{.mark} as being governed by an ordering
principle that can be discovered through reason]{.underline}. The
Socratic dialectic, which involves [[contest]{.mark}ing contemplative
[minds]{.mark}, [assumes]{.mark} such [a rational order of
reality]{.mark} and aims at grasping it through ideas]{.underline}
(Gouldner 1965: 259-296; Bloch 1983: 289-90); Prus 2004: 13). Plato's
ideas of 'truth', 'justice' and 'beauty', Thomas Aquinas' 'bonum
commune' are examples of such intellectual forms. In sociology, the
assumption of a rational order of reality is expressed in, for instance,
C. Wright Mills' 'democratic society of publics', Robert Bellah's 'good
society', or Philip Selznick's 'moral commonwealth'.2 [These [concepts
presume]{.mark} that [there are criteria to distinguish between
good]{.mark} and oppressive orders, and that it is humanly (politically
and morally) possible and even necessary to strive after such
goods]{.underline}. 2 In his presidential address, Herbert Gans (1989:
5) argues that 'we ought also to confront once more an old, recently
forgotten question: what is a good society and how can sociology help
bring it about?' OSSEWAARDE: THE TRAGIC TURN IN THE RE-IMAGINATION OF
PUBLICS 49 From a Heraclitean perspective, [these ideas of an order are
illusions, since **[reality is a flux]{.mark} that is not governed by
any order, and [in which no order can be
discerned]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Reality is a]{.mark} stream (or
[perpetual cycle]{.mark}) [of destruction]{.mark}]{.underline} (death)
-- 'the violence of the dialectic', says Walter Benjamin (1977: 166) --
and becoming (birth), [kept in movement by the continuous strife between
opposite forces.]{.underline} The Socratic view, on the other hand, is
that the flux is only appearance, and that the enlightened mind can see
that there is a hidden, yet discoverable, order of things behind and
beyond this physical (phenomenological) veil (Ossewaarde 2010). Reason
is the eye that discovers this sublime and eternal meta-physical reality
or ordering principle, while the body, with its senses and appetites,
can only experience the flux. Reason discovers the good order, which is
immune to the forces of the flux or to fate, and which can be imposed on
the flux. Chaotic or meaningless realities are, therefore, reshaped in
accordance with reason, to achieve, for instance, a more democratic or
more just world. Ideas of democracy and justice have always been and
will always be, and since reason dwells in this permanence, it can
unveil them. The Socratic intimate relation between reason and the good
implies that all evil in the world springs from ignorance, which is not
in accordance with reason. Therefore, all evil in the world (falsehood,
injustice, oppression, pain) can, at least potentially, be overcome when
the world is ordered according to the ideas revealed by reason. The
knowledge of the rational order of reality can only be acquired in and
through the art of friendly dispute (Ossewaarde 2010). Ignorance is not
only the fruit of a suppressed Socratic dialectic, but it also promotes
this repression (for instance, by condemning Socrates to death). Hence,
[[ignorance maintains]{.mark} a vicious circle ([the flux]{.mark}),
[and]{.mark} in the end, it [is the source of all evil]{.mark}, boredom
and woeful agony, while [knowledge of the]{.mark} truth about the
[self]{.mark}]{.underline} and the beautiful ordering principle that
governs true reality [[is the highest]{.mark} that [one can
achieve]{.mark} in life]{.underline}. The one who knows also sees the
unity of all goods (justice, freedom, happiness, health and so forth) in
the one Good. According to the Heraclitean perspective, [there may be
such a thing as [reason]{.mark}, but [it is not exempt from the]{.mark}
becoming and [passing of things]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} therefore, sways
just as much as passions]{.underline}. [Reality, which is always in a
state of becoming, [does not have a given end]{.mark}, since it does not
a beginning]{.underline} (foundation). Neither reality nor the self are
to be shaped according to ideas revealed by reason, since these are pure
illusions. Reality is at a certain time and in a given place, when
opposite forces are temporarily united, but this union does not last
long, and the process of becoming carries on. The self is when the
contest between inner forces comes to rest, but the flux ensures that
this respite is never permanent. [Reason does not have much to say or
see in this chaotic process, in which all kinds of (irrational) forces
play crucial roles]{.underline}. In other words, the truth about reality
is absurd and horrific. The ancient tragedians like Aeschylus and
Sophocles express most vividly this Heraclitean vision of the flux, in
which the self is carried and tossed back and forth (Steiner 1980: 169).
Oedipus' lot is such that he wishes he was never born. OSSEWAARDE: THE
TRAGIC TURN IN THE RE-IMAGINATION OF PUBLICS 50 The Heraclitean unity in
the art of tragedy Nietzsche's vision of reality in The Birth of Tragedy
can be described as Heraclitean. He argues that reality is a process of
becoming or a 'flood of suffering and troubles' (Nietzsche 2000: 57),
which is animated by a strife or ambiguous relationship between two
opposite forces or drives that inhere in a reality that has neither
origin nor foundational principle. He names the two opposites after two
mythological deities, Dionysus and Apollo. In Greek mythology, Dionysus
is the god of wine, fertility, vitality, ecstasy, intoxication and the
art of music, who was unjustly dismembered by his enemies in a spell of
individuation and later restored by his brother Apollo (Sweet 1999: 354;
357; Nietzsche 2000: 59-60). Apollo is the god of Delphi, of light and
dream. He is 'an ethical deity' and the god of individuation and of
'just limits' (Nietzsche 2000: 21-2; 31; 58). Nietzsche (2000: 17) holds
that these two opposites are united in the art of tragedy: The difficult
relation between the Apollonian and the Dionysian in tragedy should
really be symbolized through a fraternal bond between both deities:
Dionysus speaks the language of Apollo and Apollo finally speaks the
language of Dionysus, and so the highest goal of tragedy and of art
itself is achieved. Tragedy, Nietzsche emphasizes, is a Dionysian art.
The distinctive feature of Attic tragedy, however, which Nietzsche
considers to be the most perfect art of tragedy, is that it has
succeeded in coupling the Dionysian and the Apollonian opposites in a
fraternal bond, without one force annihilating the other (Nietzsche
2000: 46; Weinberg 1967: 256; 263). [[Tragic art]{.mark} does not only
presume a fundamentally pessimistic view of the world, but it also
[offers a way to live with this truth]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nietzsche
(2000: 60) notes how there is a 'tragedy's doctrine of the mysteries'.
Nietzsche (2000: 60) points out that [the [knowledge of the tragedian is
the]{.mark} 'the [fundamental knowledge of]{.mark} the [unity]{.mark} of
all that exists']{.underline}, which is the consideration of the spell
of Dionysus' individuation as the original cause of evil and 'the
presentiment of a restored unity' as the original cause of the good. The
narrated life of the hero depicts this suffering of individuation and at
the same celebrates his heroic longing for an original unity, which is
fate. The tragic hero is always a noble character, who is driven by a
powerful vitality and potency, and who has a strong will and energy to
live life to the fullest. Despite fear and evil, the tragic hero is able
to surpass all human limits, to finally succumb to this same
transgression or sacrilege (Nietzsche 2000: 58).3 This fundamental
imprudence, unreasonableness or disobedience is what triggers the
Apollonian wrath on Dionysus. Yet, it is precisely this heroic,
Dionysian impulse that leads to the climax in the tragic story of the
hero, since it is his 'attempt to step outside the spell of
individuation and to become the single essence of the 3 Nietzsche (2000:
55) gives the example of the tragic hero's incest as a monstrous
transgression of nature. Kurt Weinberg (1967: 265) points out that
'tragedy is invented to ascribe dignity to crime.' OSSEWAARDE: THE
TRAGIC TURN IN THE RE-IMAGINATION OF PUBLICS 51 world' (Nietzsche 2000:
57). Tragic art expresses the contradictions hidden in things and the
agonies that necessarily flow from them. The agony of Dionysus is the
one of a humanity that is torn to pieces in a disorderly world (Steiner
1980: 167). The 'dismemberment, the properly Dionysian suffering,'
Nietzsche says in a Heraclitean style (2000: 59), 'is similar to a
transformation into earth, wind, fire and water.' The material world can
only be a whole if these four elements are united as One. In other
words, the suffering of Dionysus reflects broken bonds, between man and
man, and between nature and man (Nietzsche 2000: 22). In his poem The
Persians, Aeschylus, the first of the Attic tragedians, presents Xerxes,
the greatest enemy of the Greeks, as the tragic hero. In his disastrous
defeat at Salamis, the Persian king falls into the Dionysian abyss by
crossing the Straits of Helle, driven by his strong Dionysian impulses
and energy (his desire to conquer Europe). By imprudently transgressing
the Apollonian border that separates Europe and Asia, Xerxes encounters
Apollo's wrath. Xerxes' fatal misjudgment, which he is destined to make
given his blessing and curse, leads to the ruin of the Persians, the
climactic unity of opposites. And thereby, the hero transforms the
unformulated field of tragic fate, the Dionysian abyss, into a sublime
piece of art, of which he forms part. A tragedy like The Persians tells
a profound truth about the Heraclitean flux and the place of human
beings in it, presenting the hero's encounters with the isolation, death
and suffering, which are part of the human condition, as the hero
experiences it (Curtis 2007: 860; 870). In tragedies, [heroes like
Xerxes have a Dionysian flaw or impulse that is inescapable, given the
forces of necessity.4 They refuse to accept the limits drawn by Apollo,
transgress these limits, fight against misfortune, succumb to their
cruel fate]{.underline}, and mystically abandon their selves (Nietzsche
2000: 24; Alford 1992: 157; Antonio 1995: 7; 16; 19). The hero's
self-abandonment, after being ruined, is typically an act of rage
(Steiner 1980: 128). Such anti-climax or Dionysian defeat is most
evident in Sophocles' Oedipus myth. After having seen his sacrileges,
Oedipus becomes so disgusted with his self that he pokes out his own
eyes, so as not to see himself again. His heroic selfabandonment is
definite: he will never be king again and will be a blind beggar for the
rest of his life (Farley 1996: 127). Gone are the heroic impulses that
drove him to overcome the contradictions inherent in human life.
Apollonian and Dionysian publics The tragic art and the Socratic art of
friendly dispute take place and result in different publics. The
Socratic dialogues presume and promote Apollonian publics, which are
based on the assumption that knowledge can be acquired through
intellectual interactions. 4 Hans-Uwe Haus (2008: 321-322) points out
that 'what strikes and fascinates us in reading ancient Greek tragedy,
however, is precisely the belief that we cannot assert our will
unconditionally and that we occupy a small place in an immense universe
in which all things, even the immortal gods, are subject to one force,
the force of necessity. For it is the recognition of necessity, in one
form or another, that finally resolves the conflict in Greek tragedy.'
OSSEWAARDE: THE TRAGIC TURN IN THE RE-IMAGINATION OF PUBLICS 52 Such
publics ensure, at the same time, that the contest of minds is not
stifled by all sorts of social forces and sophistries (Voegelin 2000:
66; 123; 125). From an Apollonian viewpoint, [the essence of the
European culture is the rule of reason and the protection of the
rational order]{.underline}, through prudence and moderation, that is,
by recognizing Apollo's just limits. [Reason and the Apollonian publics
can, therefore, only flourish if the European life is lived through
friendly disputes]{.underline}, whereby the ordinary citizen is brought
on stage and gets a chance to speak. The example of such a wise,
reasonable and serene way of life is set by Socrates, the Apollonian
intellectual hero who sacrifices his own life for the sake of the
eternal Reason and ideas. Socrates even succeeds in turning his own
death into a theme for his dialogue, which in turn makes his heroic
death become the 'art of dying' (Bradatan 2007: 589; 602). The
Apollonian hero -- the exemplary figure for scientists standing in
Europe's Socratic tradition -- outwits even death (Nietzsche 2000: 76;
82). Neither the horror of death, which is itself just appearance, nor
the Dionysian abyss is experienced. The material reality veils what
cannot be killed. The Heraclitean perspective, on the other hand, does
not perceive reason as such a praiseworthy human characteristic. [Reason
is, just as everything that is human, subjected to the
flux.]{.underline} Hence, for Nietzsche, the 'art of living' is not so
much philosophizing and learning how to die as to live life with all its
horrors and absurdities and purposelessness to the fullest (Nietzsche
2000: 128; Dienstag 2001: 924-925). [This powerful will to live is
expressed in and reinforced through the Dionysian festival]{.underline}.
It is the powerful or heroic will that characterizes Nietzsche's 'good
European', who is cultivated in an 'aesthetic public'. Tragedies used to
be performed during the Dionysian festival, in an Athenian sanctuary of
Dionysus, in honor of the god of wine (Lea 1977: 36-7; Herington 1986:
19; Scullion 2002: 107).5 Tragedies are performed against a background
of enchanting myths, in particular those of Dionysus' dismemberment and
of his madness inflicted by Hera. Dionysian or aesthetic publics enable
the audience, to borrow Leszek Kolakowski's words (1989: 45), 'to
participate in myth,' so that it can fully experience the tragedy and
become part of it. In aesthetic publics, [the demigod and his chorus of
satyrs, rather than debating ordinary citizens, are at the centre of the
stage, offering a spectacle that, in Nietzsche's view, is a 'more
truthful, more real, more complete image of existence' than the
Apollonian thinker]{.underline} 'who commonly considers himself the sole
reality' (Nietzsche 2000: 47). During the Dionysian festival, the
audience becomes intoxicated with the Dionysian ecstasy and will to live
(Nietzsche 2000: 52; Dienstag 2001: 932), which Nietzsche (2000: 113)
calls 'an orgiastic feeling of freedom.' Freedom is here associated with
the free play of the virile passions and energies, which refuse to be
defeated by suffering and death. This feeling of freedom is an aesthetic
experience that is at once ecstatic, musical and intoxicating (Sweet
1999: 354). The audience becomes part of the performance, is carried
into life of the legendary hero, tastes the Dionysian euphoria,
jubilates in the hero's triumphs and mourns his downfall and mysterious
selfabandonment (Nietzsche 2000: 48; Weinberg 1967: 252-3; 266; Dienstag
2001: 927). 5 The Dionysian festival and the contest of the tragedies
had originally been institutionalized in ancient Athens, in around 534
BCE, during the reign of Pisistratus. OSSEWAARDE: THE TRAGIC TURN IN THE
RE-IMAGINATION OF PUBLICS 53 The Attic tragedians remind their audience
that the dramatic ruin of the hero can also be their own fate and
constantly charge their tragedies with deeper tragic significance,
against the superstitions of the crowd (Lea 1977: 37-38; Steiner 1980:
315; Alford 1992: 159; Antonio 1995: 30; Dienstag 2001: 931).6 Nietzsche
(2000: 111) argues that the art of tragedy is 'a necessary healing
craft'. He holds that only the performed tragedy, that is, the aesthetic
experience of the Dionysian festival, can reshape the disgust of life
into the will to live, and hence, saves from collapsing into a condition
of despair or apathy (Nietzsche 2000: 46). The audience needs the
literary art, 'as a protection and remedy' (Nietzsche 2000: 84), to be
able to tolerate (rather than ignore or escape from) reality. The
redemptive power of the tragedy lies in its fusion of greatness with
suffering -- of the tragic hero in this case -- against a background of
singing and dancing chorus and audience (Nietzsche 2000: 19; 23; Farley
1996: 125). The participants literally imbibe the powerful passions that
characterize a heroic life and end. If they are, in turn, able to live
such a life, they become Nietzsche's 'good Europeans'. The music of the
chorus, in the performance, forms a crucial part of the aesthetic
experience of tragic heroism. Nietzsche argues that 'real music' or
'serious music' is 'the imageless Dionysian art' (Nietzsche 2000: 19)
performed by the chorus in honor of Dionysus. Such a music expresses the
'essence of the world', that is misfortune, which the public of
'aesthetic listeners' (Nietzsche 2000: 120) can hear ('drink'). The
Heraclitean flux can, indeed, only be expressed in imageless sounds,
while the 'voice' of reality is blocked by rationalizations (Friedlander
2006: 640). Music expresses that which words can hardly tell namely the
experiences of perpetual destruction and re-creation, death and
re-birth, and the climactic moment when the hero meets his fate
(Friedlander 2006: 634-5). Tragic music is therefore an 'original echo
of pain' (Nietzsche 2000: 35), the pain of Dionysus and of everyone who
longs for greatness, the infinite. The musical performance requires, or
presupposes, an audience that is sensitive enough to be able to hear the
shattering of fluid realities or 'the undistorted voice' of the flux
(Nietzsche 2000: 90) -- the pain of becoming -- in the performance of
the tragedian. In the Apollonian art, by contrast, suffering is
vanquished or erased by the beauty of beautiful images that depict a
reality free from contradictions. Nietzsche points out the antagonistic
relationship between the Socratic dialogue and the Dionysian festival.
Apollonian publics promote a life of intellectual contempt for 6 Jean
Bodin stresses that this so-called deeper tragic significance must be
understood within the context of the Athenian city-state. Bodin (2008:
280) argues that the legend of the tragic hero 'functions as a warning
addressed to the demos.' The tragedian understands the city-state, as
Anitra Laycock (2009: 29) emphasizes, as the extension of the rule of
Olympian gods into the human realm. Paul Epstein (1996: 30), therefore,
calls the city-state an 'Olympian institution' (Epstein 1996: 30).
Nietzsche (2000: 28), however, claims that [these gods were 'born of
dream, as a screen' and created by the Greeks themselves, who invented
them to be able to live with 'the terrors and horrors of
existence'.]{.underline} OSSEWAARDE: THE TRAGIC TURN IN THE
RE-IMAGINATION OF PUBLICS 54 the primitive, unrestrained instinct,
feverish impulses and wildness of the Dionysian impulses, which are
aroused during the performance of the tragedy. For Nietzsche, Socrates
is 'a newly born daemon' and a 'despotic logician' who 'single-handedly
dares negate the Greek character', which is so closely related to the
Greek mysteries, and instead, creates an Apollonian or Socratic culture
in which there is no place for the Dionysian will to live (Nietzsche
2000: 68; 79; 74). In this culture, the reckless hero who provokes fate
and transgresses all reasonable limits is a bad example for citizens.7
Apollo or the wise philosopher, on the other hand, teaches how to live
serenely, in the belief of eternal forms. In his dialogues, Socrates
shows an open distaste for the formlessness, fickleness and futility of
music, myth and dance, and he reduces the intoxicating tension of the
tragic with comical remarks and laughter (Detienne 2001: 150-1).
Nietzsche insists that **[[the death of tragedy begins with]{.mark} the
[Socratic dialogue]{.mark}, which is a cowardly [escape of the mind into
a dream-world]{.mark} of ideas]{.underline}** (Nietzsche 2000: 83). 'Not
reflection, no! - but true knowledge, insight into the horrific truth'
is what fundamental knowledge is about (Nietzsche 2000: 46). The really
wise man is Oedipus, not Socrates (Nietzsche 2000: 55); and yet, in the
tragedians' plays, the Dionysian hero is, despite his sharp reason,
ignorant. The wise Oedipus did not know who is father was. Nietzsche,
however, notes how even the life of Socrates eventually expresses the
union between the Apollonian and Dionysian forces; or more exactly, how
the Apollonian drive in Socrates can no longer resist the Dionysian
impulse. This climax, according to Nietzsche, is reached when the hero
(Socrates) finally becomes musical, just when he is about to die
(Nietzsche 2000: 80). Then he comes to realize, against his earlier
beliefs, that philosophizing may not be the highest (or most beautiful)
art after all, and that there may be wisdom in music, which had thus far
been inaccessible to him as theoretical man. For Nietzsche, the last
days of Socrates reveal that [Apollo needs Dionysus, especially in times
of existential crises like an imminent death and wars, and that Dionysus
can make himself be heard and felt even in the life of the most
reasonable (Apollonian) men]{.underline}. If Dionysus could make such a
come-back in the life of Socrates (the personification of European
rationality), then, tragedy can also be revived in the Apollonian
culture of European modernity. When the Enlightenment movement was
destroying the old rational order of Christian Europe, Richard Wagner
arose as the new Aeschylus, to reaffirm the Greek character of the
German nation. At least that was Nietzsche's hope when he wrote The
Birth of Tragedy. 7 Nietzsche (2000: 73) presents Socrates and Euripides
as hand in glove, holding that 'Socrates used to help Euripides with his
writing.' In his The Bacchae, Euripides narrates the story of a
Dionysian festival in which things go terribly out of hand. When King
Pentheus of Thebes declares a ban on the worship of Dionysus, Pentheus'
cousin, the mask of Dionysus, invites the King to attend the Dionysian
public that had driven the Theben women into ecstatic frenzy. During the
orgiastic worship of Dionysus, the deity calls out to his worshippers
and accuses Pentheus. This drives the women wild, including the king's
mother, who, in her frenzy, cuts off the head of her son, and only
realizes what she has done when she awakens from her Dionysian spell. In
The Bacchae, Dionysus is not always noble, and the chorus, including its
singing, dancing, music and acting, plays a minor role. OSSEWAARDE: THE
TRAGIC TURN IN THE RE-IMAGINATION OF PUBLICS 55 Bureaucracy and publics
[For Nietzsche, [the Heraclitean vision sees the truth about
reality]{.mark} while tragedy subsequently transforms this unbearable
absurdity of life into an aesthetic public, **[without masking]{.mark}
the [horror]{.mark} itself**]{.underline}. The Socratic dialectic and
its Apollonian publics intellectually involve people who are incited to
search for the good in the realm of ideas, in spite of the
phenomenological flux and absurdity of things. [[Dionysian
publics]{.mark} do not try to check the becoming of reality, but
instead, [incite]{.mark} the [participants to live it as art]{.mark}, by
making them become part of the story itself]{.underline}. In Socratic
dialogues, disputing friends critically question all established orders
in their search for the rational or good order. Both the Dionysian and
the Apollonian publics can disturb an established order and
institutions. [[The urge to control drives bureaucracies]{.mark},
[which]{.mark}, in order to effectively fix one type of reality, have to
[destroy all forms of publics]{.mark} that have the potential
[to]{.mark} upset order]{.underline}. In modern societies,
[bureaucracies [impose]{.mark} an enlightenment model of [rational
order]{.mark}]{.underline} devoid of mythical content and uncertain
self-knowledge, [upon a reality that is thereby made fully
intelligible]{.underline}, controllable and correctible. Nietzsche
considers the European enlightenment as the modern successor to the
Socratic myth-annihilation, which characterizes the Apollonian publics.8
The enlightenment movement's confidence in the capacity of reason and
its belief in the rational order of reality are Socratic in origin.
However, Nietzsche suggests that the enlightenment goes steps further
than Socrates in its annihilation of myth. Although Socrates ridicules
and destroys the legendary tales of the tragedians, his dialogues are
premised upon the myth of the Delphic oracle (which revealed that there
was no one wiser than Socrates). And, although Socrates maintains that
reason rather than myth is the foundation of European culture, reason,
the nous, is itself a mythical entity (Nietzsche 2000: 72): the 'voice
of reason' is the 'divine voice' of Socrates' daimonion, which makes
itself be heard in the dialogues (Nietzsche 2000: 75). In the Dialectic
of Enlightenment, Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno, inspired by
Nietzsche (c.f., Wellmer 1991: 3), maintain that the enlightenment
movement postulates a vision of reason that is devoid of mythical
content. [Enlightenment [reason]{.mark}]{.underline}, in its origin,
seeks to make people think for themselves and to liberate them from
their fears and superstitions, but, [in the modernization process, it
[becomes an instrument that serves bureaucratic objectives]{.mark}, such
as enforcing laws effectively, fixing a machine, or making a business
run more efficiently]{.underline}.9 Horkheimer and Adorno (2007: 57)
emphasize that Nietzsche, like 8 Antonio (1995: 8) points out that
'according to Nietzsche, the Protestant 'north' is the heartland of
Socratic culture,' the enlightenment movement being represented most
explicitly in Kant's works and, as Benjamin (1977) affirms, in German
drama or Baroque opera. 9 Horkheimer and Adorno (2007: 103-4) point out
that [the enlightenment movement is primarily directed against the myth
of the teleological order of natural law (discoverable by the nous) and
the charisma of the authorities that safeguard the pre-given
order]{.underline}. OSSEWAARDE: THE TRAGIC TURN IN THE RE-IMAGINATION OF
PUBLICS 56 Hegel before him, had grasped this pathology of enlightenment
reason that turns into a bureaucratic instrument. The reduction of the
Socratic nous to an instrumental reason has far-reached political and
cultural implications. [Enlightenment reason provides the static
concepts, mummified categories, classifications and catalogues that are
required to construct bureaucratic limits and boundaries, which in turn
rationally order realit]{.underline}y (Honneth 2007: 70). Dialogical or
democratic practices have no place in such a technical organization of
reality. Bureaucracies, whose function is to implement the enlightenment
or any other theoretical model of reality, have no need for the Socratic
publics and consider dialogues and the need for intellectual
justification rather troublesome and disorderly (Gouldner 1973: 76;
Gardiner 2004: 35). The (potential) [[participants of Socratic dialogues
are turned into bureaucratic subjects]{.underline}]{.mark}, like
workers, consumers and clients, that is, **[[into 'spectators without
influence']{.mark}, whose lives are [governed by]{.mark} the enlightened
power [elites]{.mark} and civil servants]{.underline}** (Honneth 2007:
33). [The identity of bureaucratic subjects is determined by typically
large and powerful organizations]{.underline}, such as government
agencies and enterprises (Mills 1956: 355). The Enlightenment movement
is, in Nietzsche's words (2000: 85), 'the most illustrious opponent of
the tragic world-view.' Horkheimer and Adorno stress that the
enlightenment movement, or perhaps more exactly, some kind of process
deriving from it, eventually comes to substitute the plebeian
entertainment of mass culture industries for the tragic art of the
aesthetic publics. According to Nietzsche, [[bureaucratic
subjects]{.mark} who live in a disenchanted world in which myths are
annihilated by Apollonian reason [cannot bear the horrific]{.mark} and
absurd [truth about their]{.mark} own [existence]{.mark}]{.underline}.10
The subjects of the culture industries no longer have the opportunity to
participate in enchanting tragic myths that cultivate powerful passions
and the Dionysian will to live, which characterize Nietzsche's 'good
European'. The entertainment provided by manufactured images and
commodity forms, like music productions, films, television programmes
and glossy magazines, ensures that the absurdity of life and the
Dionysian abyss are forgotten (Horkheimer and Adorno 2007: 159).11 Being
thoroughly rationalized, such subjects cannot develop the mythical
imagination or a certain sensitivity that would have allowed them to
'live the tragedy' in and through the aesthetic publics. In a
bureaucratic culture, [subjects cannot experience, feel or live the
tragic fate of the Dionysian hero]{.underline}, because, as Nietzsche
(2000: 10 Nietzsche (2000: 104-5) identifies the opera and the 'theatre
public' (Nietzsche 2000: 43) as optimistic [entities that do not 'bear
the slightest trace of the elegiac pain of an eternal loss, but rather
the serenity of eternal rediscovery, of comfortable pleasure in an
idyllic reality]{.underline}.' Benjamin (1977) contrasts the seventeenth
century German opera (the Trauerspiel or mourning play) with Attic
tragedy. Like Nietzsche, Benjamin stresses that the latter is mythic in
its conception, while the former is organized within a rational order
(Friedlander 2006: 633). 11 Neil Curtis (2007: 861; 877) points out
that, in the culture industry, the mass media plays the role of the
chorus and yet, it cannot function as the chorus because it separates
the spectator or the listener from the play. OSSEWAARDE: THE TRAGIC TURN
IN THE RE-IMAGINATION OF PUBLICS 57 45) insists, shielded by
bureaucracies, they are not 'equipped for the most delicate and intense
suffering.' [[Bureaucracies]{.mark} expect and [demand passive obedience
from their subjects]{.mark}, which makes cultural movement nearly
impossible]{.underline}. Such passive spectators or so-called 'consumers
of art' (Shrum 1991: 349; 371), are, Horkheimer and Adorno (2007: 155;
166) point out, deluded en masse, governed to take refuge in
comfortable, boring and mindless bureaucratic forms of entertainment.
[Culture industries provide ready-made experiences to a passive public
that is willing to buy them to fill the emptiness of a disenchanted
world and appease the cowardly fear of living in the flux]{.underline},
which they explicitly experience in temporary relationships and the
continuous flow of new products and changed consumption patterns. The
experience of the flux can also be more implicit or unconscious,
resulting in a sort of malaise, feeling of insecurity or restlessness.
However, [[the escape from life]{.mark} [into]{.mark} a [manufactured
dream-world]{.mark} of cultural productions does not really quench the
thirst]{.underline}, as the Socratic dialogue and the Dionysian festival
do, which, therefore, allows the culture industry to carry on with its
provision of manufactured dream-worlds, [to [fill an emptiness that
never decreases]{.mark}]{.underline}.

['[Politics']{.mark} [refers to the conventional]{.mark}, mainstream
[understanding]{.mark} of the term, one that is generally [associated
with]{.mark} empirical phenomena such governance, state affairs,
institutional [policies]{.mark}, elections, human rights, and so on
.]{.underline} These can be generally understood to be facts about
society. '[[Politics']{.mark} in this sense, can be said to
[reflect]{.mark} the [empirical facts about]{.mark} human beings in
[society]{.mark}]{.underline}, their activities, practices, and so on.
This approach to 'politics' is what concerns political science. [The
concept of '[the political]{.mark}' refers to something entirely
different]{.underline}. If political science has traditionally concerned
itself with the empirical field of politics, [political theory in
general investigates the essence of the political]{.underline}. To ask
what the essence of something is, is to seek to define that necessary
kernel or characteristic which makes something what it is. So when we
seek to define the essence of the political, we are seeking to determine
its definitive element. For example, as we shall see below in greater
detail, Mouffe's conception of the political refers to antagonisms
between human beings which she maintains are essential and constitutive
to any society whatsoever.31 This antagonism is certainly empirically
illustrated in society as facts about society, but [its root [lies in
intrinsic claims about what it means to be human]{.mark}]{.underline}.
For example, it is a known empirical fact that there are specific kinds
of antagonisms present in our contemporary society: antagonisms of
between classes, ethnicities, religions, genders, and so on. Insofar as
we consider these antagonisms only through empirical means (e.g.,
statistical data), all we ascertain about these antagonisms are a
confirmation of their occurrence, and a breakdown of its components
(e.g., x many people turned out to vote during the elections, there were
y number of protestors at the rally, and so on). It is an empirically
known fact that in 2011, when hundreds of thousands gathered in Cairo's
Tahrir Square to protest Hosni Mubarak's government, but this fact does
not tell us anything more about the event. [[Empirical facts may reflect
the essence]{.mark} of the political (e.g., antagonism), [but in order
to explain]{.mark} what [that essence]{.mark} is and justify it, [we
need to enter]{.mark} the domain of [the political]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The crucial point is that whether or not human beings are innately
antagonistic is a disputable claim. [It is an ontological claim that
human beings are antagonistic, one which depends on the type of ontology
one adopts and commits to]{.underline}. [If the ontology I subscribe to
does not hold that antagonism is an inherent property of what it means
to be human, then my definition of the essence of the political will
necessarily be different than Mouffe's.]{.underline} It will no longer
depend on the idea of human antagonism. It is ontologically contestable
that antagonism is an implicit trait of human beings, [and so
[ontological claims]{.mark} about being human, [inevitably]{.mark} [end
up influencing]{.mark} one's [conception of the
political]{.mark}.]{.underline} Furthermore, given that the theorists
within the ontological turn in political theory disagree over the exact
meaning of 'the political', their disagreement in fact revolves around
what constitutes the essence of the political (e.g., antagonism, etc.).
However, [[the essence of the political]{.mark} (whatever it may be)
[does not exist in some vacuum independent]{.mark} of human
beings.]{.underline} On the contrary, [politics is of course a human
phenomenon and it arises out of human activity within a social
context.]{.underline} Thus, [when we seek to define the essence of the
political, its definition inevitably ends up being influenced by
ontological claims about human beings.]{.underline} The discourse of
human characteristics is the discourse of the ontology of being human.
It is this kind of ontology that concerns the ontological turn in
political theory. So, while the term 'politics' refers to factual human
practices and activities in society, ['[the political']{.mark} [refers
to the constitutive dimensions of human societies]{.mark}, which are
[influenced by ontological claims]{.mark} of what it means to be
human]{.underline}. To help better clarify the difference, let's briefly
consider Mouffe's account of the distinction: "by 'the political' I mean
the dimension of antagonism which I take to be constitutive of human
societies, while by 'politics' I mean the set of practices and
institutions through which an order is created, organizing human
coexistence in the context of conflictuality provided by the
political."32 So for Mouffe while human antagonism is an essential
ingredient of any human society, what ultimately gives shape to the
social order are human activities and social institutions within the
context of this antagonism. For example, the institution of the prison
system can be explained by Mouffe's concept of the political, insofar as
dividing up a society's populace on the basis of those who uphold the
law and those who break it is seen as an antagonistic relation.
Prisoners and non-prisoners are antagonistic insofar as they are
interpreted on the basis of a 'we' versus 'them' dichotomy. The point is
that identifying the prisoners as prisoners can only be achieved
relative to the identification of non-prisoners as non-prisoners. If you
break the law and are accordingly punished for it, you are judged in
relation to the rest of the population that did not break this law and
has maintained the peace. This is all to say that the concept of the
political, as antagonism for example, describes an integral,
constitutive part of human society, which finds its origin in the human
being. The explanation of society's formation will depend on how the
ontology in question seeks to account for human existence and
experience. Thus, [at the core of 'the political' are ontological claims
about being human.]{.underline} 33 While 'politics' only refers to the
empirical practices of human beings in society, ['the political'
encompasses a more fundamental and essential level of what constitutes
politics because it aims to explain the essential human characteristics
that inform the formation of societies]{.underline}. This does not mean
that the formation of human societies can be reduced to essential
ontological claims about being human, but rather that what it means to
be human certainly plays an important role in society's foundation. To
put it rather crudely using Mouffe's conception as an example: 33 Or to
put it another way: 'politics' concerns the empirical activity of human
beings within society, while empirical facts tell us that there are
antagonisms among human beings in society, while ontological claims
about being human tells us why those antagonisms exist.

#### Attempts to impose a priori rules on the activity is a manifestation of the will to truth that ignores micropower relations and disciplinary power that punishes deviancy. Our interpretation is an immanent worldview that allows for alternative ways of thinking that challenge the primacy of identity

[A dynamic in which power constructs identities against
resistance]{.underline} is often ascribed to Foucault.11 Yet in his
genealogical studies of criminality and sexuality, [disciplinary and
normalizing powers produce neither normalized, disciplined selves nor
identifiable, knowable deviants]{.underline} whose distance from the
norm can be measured and corrected. Certainly, [the norm and the various
deviant categories mapped out in opposition to it are developed and used
to coordinate the deployment of disciplinary power]{.underline}. But
[the products of this power remain enigmatic]{.underline}, as Foucault's
case studies of Herculine Barbin and Pierre Rivie\`re demonstrate (see
Foucault, 1975, 1980). Foucault thus maintains that [the [prison system
aims]{.mark} not [to]{.mark} eliminate delinquency or even to genuinely
comprehend it, but rather to [manage
deviance]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} and the consistent failure of
the prison to reform inmates must be understood in this light (see
Foucault, 1979, esp. Part 4). Disciplinary society seeks an efficient
use of resources for the management of life, but [while a will to
identity is wrapped up in this project, the mechanisms of power do not
produce identity as a result]{.underline}. What is to be understood by
the disciplining of societies in Europe since the eighteenth century is
not, of course, that the individuals who are part of them become more
and more obedient, nor that they are set about assembling in barracks,
schools, or prisons; rather that an increasingly better invigilated
process of adjustment has been sought after F more and more rational and
economic F between productive activities, resources of communication,
and the play of power relations. (Foucault, 1982, 219) Crucially, [this
drive for efficiency is replete with inefficiencies, which only
reinforces the project's strength]{.underline}. [While [modern
society]{.mark}, compelled by a will to truth to name,]{.underline}
locate, observe, measure, and know, [[is driven to identify deviations
from a norm]{.mark} that no one even fits in the first place [and to
police]{.mark} and correct these [deviations]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
name of promoting conformity with this fictitious standard, [the effect
is very much the reverse: [differences are multiplied rather than
gathered under]{.mark} an umbrella of [normality]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Yet thro[ugh the persistent failure of the powers of individution,
classification, and correction to manifest an efficient social system,
these same disciplinary mechanisms are extended into more areas of
modern life.]{.underline} **[[Declarations of prison failure are always
followed by moves to maintain them]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Foucault,
1979, 272) [and the entire system of [disciplinary power ends up]{.mark}
trapped in its own logic, [unable to do anything more than
increase]{.mark} its [policing]{.mark}]{.underline}. Ultimately prisons
look like factories, which look like hospitals, which look like schools.
And when one examines the personal histories of the various 'deviants'
that modernity seeks to police, they all have already passed through a
myriad of institutions purportedly designed to normalize them (ibid.,
301). If Foucault's overall project can be seen as a challenge to [this
pervasive will to identity or truth]{.underline}, then as with Nietzsche
[the will to truth must be distinguished from the dynamic of power that
constitutes it]{.underline}. Just as Nietzsche's genealogy traces
oppositional logics to a slavish perspective that denies constitutive
strife, Foucault's genealogy shows how [these same logics justify the
use of power in modern society while falsifying or masking a substantial
part of power's operations]{.underline}.12 The [difference between [norm
and deviancy is delineated through binary categories]{.mark}, the
inadequacy of which is demonstrated by the need to reinforce these
judgements by constantly invoking other, heterogeneous
oppositions]{.underline}: 'When a judgment cannot be framed in terms of
good and evil, it is stated in terms of normal and abnormal. And when it
is necessary to justify this last distinction, it is done in terms of
what is good or bad for the individual' (Foucault, 1977b, 230). Foucault
contends that [[the will to truth]{.mark} [seeks to tame]{.mark} the
excessive [power of discourse]{.mark} and today it has eclipsed and
absorbed other controls, such as prohibition or the dismissal of certain
discourses as irrational]{.underline} (Foucault, 1984, 113--114). This
shift corresponds to an apparent democratization that allows different
discourses to contest one another, yet at a different level the terms of
contestation have already been enframed. [[Discourse]{.mark} appears
increasingly liberated, but this [must be understood against a
background demand]{.mark} that discourses demonstrate their
truthfulness]{.underline}, with truth linked to purity, goodness,
utility, and universality. Our apparently liberated post-Victorian
sexuality, for example, rests upon a prior explosion of discourse that
links sex and desire to the truth of the individual (Foucault, 1990,
Parts 1--2). The ideas that power and liberation are opposed and that
discourse can be power-free or can free oneself from power hide more
subtle forms of power and discourse that condition this liberation by
constituting sexuality as repressed truth. The will to truth operates
still more subtlety by reducing events to chronological history. This
history, Foucault says, need not judge the present in terms of progress
or decline and can accept the contingency of events. Nonetheless, it is
a form of history that lacks Nietzschean historical sense. History as
practiced today does not turn away from eventsyBut the important thing
is that history does not consider an event without defining the series
of which it is part, without specifying the mode of analysis from which
that series derives, without seeking to find out the regularity of
phenomena and the limits of probability of their emergence, without
inquiring into the variations, blends and angles of the graph, without
wanting to determine the conditions on which they depend. Of course,
[history has for a long time no longer sought to understand events by
the action of causes and effects in the formless unity of a great
becoming]{.underline}, vaguely homogeneous or ruthlessly hierarchized;
but this change was not made in order to discover prior structures,
alien and hostile to the event. It was made in order to establish
diverse series, intertwined and often divergent but not autonomous,
which enable us to circumscribe the 'place' of the event, the margins of
its chance variability, and the conditions of its appearance. (Foucault,
1984, 128) For this reason, Foucault notes that although he has operated
within the sphere of historical events, his work is not one of
history.14 Rather, [it is a genealogical investigation into agonistic
power relations operating at a microscopic level and exceeding any
movement of identity and opposition]{.underline}. Although this
genealogy makes historical claims regarding changing configurations of
power, its underlying principle is that the connections between power
relations and meaning cannot be grasped according to any logic of
spatial or temporal continuity. [Juridico-discursive and psychoanalytic
models of power continue [the will to truth's forgetting of microscopic
discontinuities]{.mark}]{.underline}. The first focuses exclusively on
the macroscopic level where already constituted subjects wield power in
a negative fashion and where power and freedom can be opposed. [The
second [treats power]{.mark} as constitutive, but conceives it [in
oppositional terms]{.mark}, with repressive power constructing the
desire to transgress power's boundaries]{.underline}. Psychoanalysis
thereby takes the binary system of licit and illicit that is part of the
juridico-discursive model and extends it to all levels of power
relations (see Foucault, 1990, 81--85). Social agents such as a judge,
parent, police officer, or psychiatric expert certainly possess powers
that they may choose to exercise or not exercise, but these agents and
their possessed powers refer back to a context of meanings and truths.
These meanings and truths are not pregiven, but the power that produces
them is not one possessed by agents. Instead, it constructs the social
positions they occupy. [This network of constitutive power relations,
like Nietzsche's, consists of relations of strife]{.underline}. Foucault
thus presents his micropowers as a 'moving substrate of force relations
which, by virtue of their inequality, constantly engender states of
power, but the latter are always local and unstable' (ibid., 93). This
inequality in flux constitutes the repetitive mechanisms of repressive
power as 'the over-all effect that emerges from all these mobilities,
the concatenation that rests on each of them and seeks in turn to arrest
their movement' (ibid.). Through a composition of micro-forces that is
in no way a mere aggregation or totalization,15 'far-reaching, but never
completely stable, effects of domination are produced' (ibid., 102).
[[Micro-power relations are immanent in all things]{.underline}]{.mark}
F power is everywhere though, importantly, it is not everything F but
inscribed within them is a plurality of sites of resistance. Power at
this level is never simply opposed to freedom,16 and resistance, in
turn, is never reducible to some thermodynamic, 'equal and opposing'
force to power. Instead, [resistances appear in the discontinuity of
power relations themselves]{.underline}. They are 'the odd term in
relations of poweryHence they too are distributed in irregular fashion'
(Foucault, 1990, 96). [While the dynamics of constitutive relations
occasionally produce binary oppositions of power and resistance as when
the treatment of prisoners produces resentment towards the system,
leading not to reform but recidivism]{.underline} (Foucault, 1979,
264--268) F [[resistance]{.mark} more often [takes the form of]{.mark}
indeterminate [dispersions of subject positions]{.mark}]{.underline} and
internal incompatibilities arising within and among disciplinary
institutions and practices. For example, the exercise of power to
observe and investigate sexual deviance, by virtue of the voyeurism and
erotic 'hide and seek' games it encourages, proliferates rather than
controls sexual desire (Foucault, 1990, 44--45). On an institutional
level, the family and psychiatric bodies cooperate to monitor sexuality
in the home, but also come into conflict when psychiatrists seek to
institutionalize family members (ibid., 111--112). Further
discontinuities and cross-purposes follow from the lack of
correspondence between objects and discourses of knowledge and the sites
of their production, whereby the hospital as an institution to deal with
insanity has its origins not in medicine but law enforcement, while the
discourse on madness is located not in the hospital but the courts; and
the delinquent, as an object of penal law, is produced in prisons, while
prisoners are created by the judiciary (see Deleuze, 1988, esp. Part 2).
What therefore emerges in Foucault's work, just as in Nietzsche's, is a
difference exceeding the orders of identity. [A lack of homogeneity
within the self corresponds to an inability to securely place different
selves in schemas of identity and opposition]{.underline}. Foucault's
later turn to the care for the self must be understood in light of this.
It is in no way a theorization of resistance, if resistance means a
liberation from power relations although it can involve liberation from
certain formations of power (Foucault, 1988b). The care for the self, or
the relation of the self to itself, is a terrain presupposed by the very
power relations that produce disciplinary practices and institutions.
Social meanings and 'games of truth', constituted by relations of
strife, include social types that are classified and disciplined and
moral rules that establish prohibitions. But moral rules also presuppose
a subject who relates to them and, consequently, a set of self-to-self
practices through which the subject is ethically positioned. The shifts
in these practices F in terms of the ethical substance modified, the
mode or command motivating subjection to the moral law, the practices
employed in adjustment, and the telos of ethical formation17 F
demonstrate their political and ethical import not by articulating a
more ideal past,18 but by problematizing contemporary meanings and
binaries that otherwise remain unquestioned. Specifically, they
problematize the link between desire, sex, and the truth of the
individual, which is made at the expense of pleasure,19 and the
consequent anxiety to locate and normalize delinquency. [[Alternative
ways of thinking]{.mark} and acting]{.underline} follow the articulation
of the contingency of contemporary truths and identities, supporting an
experimentalism with living, which, by [[call]{.mark}ing [into question
the need to see oneself as an identity]{.mark}, promotes a political and
ethical affirmation of difference]{.underline}.20 Foucault calls this a
matter not of escaping games of truth but of playing them differently
(Foucault, 1988b, 15). Playing them differently means approaching them
with curiosity and care for what remains opaque and different, and with
a willingness to press thinking beyond its traditional limits.21 This is
[Foucault's means [to endeavour]{.mark} beyond good and evil, or to
struggle, as he puts it, [against the fascism]{.mark} not only around us
but [inside us]{.mark}]{.underline} (see Foucault in Deleuze and
Guattari, 1983, xi--xiv). Like Nietzschean noble morality, [this
Foucauldian ethics [renounce]{.mark}s those [oppositional politics that
construct the opponent as an]{.mark} 'evil [enemy']{.mark} in order
[to]{.mark} [secure]{.mark} the sanctity of [one's own
identity]{.mark}]{.underline}. Furthermore: might not this 'struggle'
that one tries to wage against the 'enemy' only be a way of making a
petty dispute without much importance seem more serious than it really
is? I mean, don't certain intellectuals hope to lend themselves greater
political weight with their 'ideological struggle' than they really
have?y And then I'll tell you: I find this 'model of war' not only a bit
ridiculous but also rather dangerous. Because by virtue of saying or
thinking 'I'm fighting against the enemy', if one day you found yourself
in a position of strength, and in a situation of real war, in front of
this blasted 'enemy', wouldn't you actually treat him as one? Taking
that route leads directly to oppression, no matter who takes it: that's
the real danger. (Foucault, 1991, 180--181) [Foucault, therefore,
refuses to engage in ideological forms of politics that, by virtue of
being totalizing, 'are always, in fact, very limited']{.underline}
(Foucault, 1988d, 375). Instead, he raises problems ignored by
established political outlooks committed to party politics or
identity-based politics. This task of thought, governed by an ethical
sense, flows into politics: 'Thinking and acting are connected in an
ethical sense, but one which has results that have to be called
political' (ibid., 377).22 Let's take an example that touches us all,
that of Poland. If we raise the question of Poland in strictly political
terms, it's clear that we quickly reach the point of saying there's
nothing we can do. We can't dispatch a team of paratroopers, and we
can't send armored cars to liberate Warsaw. I think that, politically,
we have to recognize this, but I think we also agree that, for ethical
reasons, we have to raise the problem of Poland in the form of a
nonacceptance of what is happening there, and a nonacceptance of the
passivity of our own governments. I think this attitude is an ethical
one, but it is also political; it does not consist in saying merely, 'I
protest', but in making of that attitude a political phenomenon that is
as substantial as possible, and one which those who govern, here or
there, will sooner or later be obliged to take into account. (ibid.) The
problems ignored by the normal mechanisms and institutions of politics
include those of asylums, prisons, and clinics. These are specific
fields, but they highlight the most general issues of modern Western
society: power relations and the disciplinary strategies that organize
them.23 In these ways, Foucault takes Nietzsche's critique of identity
and his dynamic of agnostic relations onto terrains in need of
politicization. [As these areas are occluded by the demand for identity
that traverses modern democratic life, they require alternative modes of
theorization and engagement.]{.underline} [[Theory]{.mark} and
practice]{.underline} become more subtle and layered than traditional
conceptualizations allow. The first [[can no longer be]{.mark} an
abstract doctrine [providing a priori rules and justifications]{.mark}
for the second]{.underline}. [Political theory in particular cannot
remain the explication of procedures to conduct and police
disputes]{.underline}, the elaboration of the conditions for a more
inclusive social milieu to resolve them, or the development of a utopian
model to inspire political action. All of these options paper over
excess by giving primacy to the reconciliation F through either simple
inclusion or simple exclusion F of divergent elements. [[Submerged
within]{.mark} any [binarism is a multiplicity to be
exposed]{.mark}]{.underline}. Politics is the strategic attempt to do
this.

#### The aff is not a rejection of the rules but rather a transgression of the "magic circle" of debate to create a smooth space for political emancipation

The [distinction between play as a "distraction" from the real and play
as a moment of emancipation seems to]{.underline}, in some sense,
[depend on the boundaries drawn between the game and the world around
it]{.underline}. The existence of an altered reality that is conducive
to playfulness has been a staple assumption of traditional ludology for
many years. Bernard Suits has described how [the act of [playing]{.mark}
[involves]{.mark} a willful [disengagement with the real]{.mark} in
order to maintain the cut and thrust of challenge [amongst people
who]{.mark} have [enter]{.mark}ed [into a contract]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
begin [play]{.mark}ing]{.underline}. Suits is essentially [ascribing the
existence of "[the magic circle]{.mark}" which [is a construction of
a]{.mark} game playing [space where]{.mark} the [normal rules of reality
are suspended]{.mark} through mutual agreement]{.underline} in the
interest of the enjoyment that can be obtained by entering into such an
agreement (Woods 2009, 205). However, in the examples listed above, [it
is precisely at the points where the playing escapes the "magic circle"
of the game when the act of play precipitates emancipation]{.underline}.
This point is made consistently by advocates of "real play" who insist
that play is only worth doing if it does directly relate to the "real"
world which surrounds the game situation. The rise of real play can be
seen to be directly associated with a postmodern take on the
construction of reality, where [all social contracts, interactions, and
even hermeneutic situations can be understood to be occurring within
some form of "game."]{.underline} News articles which highlight how
important sporting success is to a country's economic and political
fortunes provide a good expression of how permeable the magic circle has
become ("England Qualifying" 2009). There is also a growing cultural
realization that ceremony and the assumption of roles and characters are
central elements of our everyday lives---that we merely move between
various magic circles as our day progresses. In the field of ludics, the
rise of Alternative Reality Games and locative play games has emphasized
this blurring at the edges of the magic circle. Aside from the
aforementioned McGonigal, one writer who has emphasized the role of
games in challenging the magic circle is Marguerite Charmante who
tackles the limits of the magic circle head on. In her "Real Player
Manifesto," Charmante advocates "common reality as the best game engine
actually known" (2007, 1). [She goes on to advocate play as a meaningful
way to engage with any aspect of reality]{.underline}, insisting that
"ludics is a model for imbuing the thinking machine with a sense of
levity, providing the salvation that is embedded in the danger and joy
of in-game technologies" (3). Following Charmante and the Real Players,
one might argue, then, that [the [difference between games as
emancipation]{.mark} [and]{.mark} games as [capture]{.mark} [relates
to]{.mark} their [ability **to transcend the magic
circle**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [to link the levity created by play to an
application or relationship in the real world]{.underline}. What I would
like to argue, beyond this, is that [this act of "linking" can be best
understood through Deleuze and Guattari's analogy of "smooth"
assemblages]{.underline}---those [proliferated through rhizomatic
relationships]{.underline}. The problem with accepting Tauel Harper The
Smooth Spaces of Play symplokeˉ 135 [the argument that the magic circle
is bad and overcoming the magic circle is good is that the magic circle
is as enabling as much as it is distancing]{.underline}. It is the very
fact of ostensible uselessness that enables play to take place in the
first place. [[Removing]{.mark} the [instrumentality from]{.mark} the
[engagement]{.mark} is the very thing that [enables]{.mark} the
transgressive [transformations]{.mark} to take place]{.underline}. Using
the work of Deleuze and Guattari, I'd like to make the connected
suggestion that [play is one of the best available methods of developing
such "smooth" spaces.]{.underline} The Smooth versus the Striated In
their two volumes on capitalism, Anti-Oedipus (1972) and A Thousand
Plateaus, (1980) Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari develop an
ontological framework for examining the function of various social
apparatuses. Designed to surpass the binaries of the Freudian
construction of desire and action, [this ontology rested upon an idea
that desire is never good or bad but is directed towards good and bad
purposes through its engagement with various "machines" or
"assemblages."]{.underline} In examining the way in which machines
harness and thrive upon flows of desire, [Deleuze and Guattari offer a
more nuanced view of the emancipative potential of play, which avoids
the binary of magic circle = bad, real play = good.]{.underline} Deleuze
and Guattari's explanation of the relationship between smooth and
striated assemblages allows us a more sophisticated understanding of the
emancipative potential of playing. Deleuze and Guattari introduce the
notion that [game play could become a model for understanding the
differences between smooth and striated machines]{.underline}. Although
they do not elaborate on this notion, they suggest that such a model
"would compare games according to their type of space and compare game
theory on different principles (for example, the smooth spaces of Go
versus the striated space of chess)" (2004, 551). While I'm hoping that
this paper goes some way towards clarifying what they may have meant,
it's my intention to use their more established definitions of smooth
and striated as a way of understanding the role of the magic circle in
"smoothing over" striations. [The [magic circle]{.mark} depends upon a
striation from the real world to exist and [enforces]{.mark} a number of
[striations in]{.mark} the form of "[rules]{.mark}"]{.underline} and
yet, it encourages the continual renegotiation and smoothing out of
these striations. Using Deleuze and Guattari's framework, it is possible
to determine that it is [when play gives rise to smooth spaces, free
action takes place, whereas striated spaces give rise to
work]{.underline}. Deleuze and Guattari's conception of the smooth and
striated is quite counter-intuitive: the smooth is presented as
heterogeneous and the striated as homogenous. In order to ensure the
differences between two types of assemblages are clear, I shall recount
a number of distinctions Deleuze and Guattari have made between the
smooth and striated. Initially, they articulate three differences: 136
The smooth and the striated are distinguished first of all by an inverse
relation between the point and the line (in the case of the striated,
the line is between two points, while in the smooth, the point is
between two lines); and second, by the nature of the line
(smooth-directional, open intervals; dimensional-striated, closed
intervals). Finally, there is a third difference, concerning the surface
or space. In striated space, one closes off a surface and 'allocates' it
according to determinate intervals, assigned breaks; in the smooth, one
'distributes' oneself in an open space, according to frequencies and in
the course of one's crossings (logos and nomos). (2004, 530) The
consistent element in these distinctions is that the smooth is actually
composed of the diverse and unrelated, whereas the striated relates to a
universal. Another way that Deleuze and Guattari relate this distinction
is through contrasting Euclidean and Reimannian space. In Euclidean
space, all points in space are related and subordinated to one
particular point and perspective. Gravity is a good example of a force
which arranges the universe in Euclidean space, as when one "maps" the
gravitational effect of, say, the earth all forces act universally
toward one point (the earth's center) and at a constant rate. This
allows us to map all space in relation to one position. Reimannian
space, on the other hand is defined as devoid of any kind of
homogeneity...two neighbouring observers in a Riemann space can locate
the points in their immediate vicinity but cannot locate their spaces in
relation to each other without a new convention. Each vicinity is
therefore like a shred of Euclidean space, but the linkage between one
vicinity and the next is not defined and can be effected in an infinite
number of ways. (2004, 539) Simplifying in the extreme, [we can
understand [striated spaces]{.mark} as being defined by general,
universalizable rules which act to [capture]{.mark} and direct [energy
towards an instrumental end]{.mark}]{.underline}. Whereas [smooth spaces
are constituted by rulelessness]{.underline}---allowing difference to be
related in novel and creative ways. Using these guidelines, [[it is
possible to conceive the magic circle as]{.mark} having elements of
[both]{.mark} the [smooth and]{.mark} the
[striated]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the first instance, the magic circle
exists as a closed off surface, where the implicit or explicit rules
allocate the use of the space at determinate intervals (for example, the
turns order of a board game or the reciprocity of foreplay). In reading
the magic circle as striated, we see that the "game space" exists, and
is constructed, in order to achieve the successful completion of the
game; [there is an instrumental purpose behind the space---moving from
the point of encounter to the point of completion]{.underline}.
Furthermore, there is universality to the magic circle---we must all
agree to play by the same rules, so that the game may run its course. On
the other hand, [[the magic circle can]{.mark} also [be seen as]{.mark}
constituting [a "smooth space" where players]{.mark} are free to suspend
their pursuit of their own interests]{.underline}, engage in ludicrous
behaviour and, as Deleuze and Guattari would describe it,
[[experience]{.mark} a number of [becomings]{.mark}]{.underline}
(becoming a millionaire property tycoon in Monopoly, becoming Don Juan
in the bedroom). The magic Tauel Harper The Smooth Spaces of Play
symplokeˉ 137 circle is the very thing which allows players to
distribute themselves in new, transgressive ways "in the course of one's
crossings." When viewed from one perspective, the magic circle appears
as a series of striations, a device designed to ensure successful
completion of the game; when viewed from another, it appears as a
smooth, multifaceted space which can develop and accommodate highly
differentiated flows of desire in a positive, productive way. Striated
space has a resonance with homogeneity, whereas the smooth is
constituted by difference and disjuncture. A number of analogies are
employed by Deleuze and Guattari to highlight this difference, such as
molar and molecular, arborscent and rhizomatic, centred and acentred,
metric and non-metric (2004, 534). In all these instances, the former is
associated with the striated, the latter with the smooth. [The striated
is homogenizing because it acts upon all interactions in the same
way---just as the rules within the magic circle are designed to apply
equally]{.underline}. [The smooth is constituted by difference because
the negotiation of connection is itinerant]{.underline} [and
temporary]{.underline} "the linkage between one vicinity and the next is
not defined and can be effected in an infinite number of ways" (535).
[Play works to generate smooth spaces insofar as "play" encourages
diverse engagements, relationships, and transgressions]{.underline}. It
could be said, then, that [the type of game machine is the thing that
determines the emancipative potential of]{.underline} play. This is
commensurate with Deleuze and Guattari's original suggestion that a game
like Go presents a more open, versatile, and transgressive playing
experience than chess. Being a fan of chess, I prefer to think that
Deleuze and Guattari are simply not familiar enough with the latter to
properly enjoy the full experience. I would argue that their point is
that Go, while based on incredibly simple rules, produces an emergent
gaming experience, where the strategies and tactics which will win the
game will only become clear once you start playing and will depend
predominantly on the strategy and moves of your opponent. Chess, on the
other hand, represents an "imperial" form of game, where the rules are
more detailed and determine what strategies will and will not be
successful. In chess, your knowledge of the rules and strategies will
give you an advantage over an opponent and in a sense determine your
strategy before the game begins. To take two more extreme examples,
foreplay presents an open system, replete with smooth spaces (when done
well), whereas a game such as Monopoly treats all game interactions and
possibilities as largely homogenous---reducing playing itself to an
impoverished expression of self and ability. The issue of whether or not
Deleuze and Guattari's experience of chess has been shaped by the people
they have played against and, indeed, the issue of what constitutes
foreplay done well raises the next important point. While play itself
can be seen to be conducive to developing smooth spaces, and some games
are clearly better at creating playful engagement than others, the
relationship between players is also important. With chess, once you
know the strategies and tactics your opponent is likely to pursue, the
game once 138 again becomes an emergent system where the unexpected and
iterative move will often generate extreme satisfaction. This helps to
illustrate that [beyond the initial construction of the assemblages, the
way we negotiate the space is important]{.underline}. In order to
highlight this, I shall cite a personal story detailing my own
experience with a game The Merchants of Amsterdam. Playing socially with
some colleagues, this innocuous game managed to drive a wedge between
friends on the basis of different understandings of the role of the
magic circle, but through the negotiation of these understandings, it
generated a smooth and highly productive assemblage. The Merchants of
Amsterdam is a bidding game which revolves around a central "dutch
auction." During this auction, a mechanized, battery-powered pointer
swings slowly down through guilder values. All players have the option
to press the pointer at any point, agreeing in the process to pay the
guilder value indicated by the pointer for a collection of goods. As
such there is much to be gained by waiting for the pointer to drop to
the lower values but also the danger that someone else will steal in,
press the pointer, and get the goods. The issues this raises in terms of
player interaction and the physical mechanics of the process of pressing
the pointer to stop it has led to a flurry of issues and attempted
solves on the website BoardGameGeek ("hate the clock," "alternative to
the clock," "save your clock"). Using my experience with the boardgame
The Merchants of Amsterdam, I would like to argue that [a playful
attitude entices striated magic circles to become smooth, in a way that
is illustrative of how [play]{.mark} [can]{.mark} be seen to [foster
transformative transgressions and]{.mark}, in turn, [lead to political
emancipation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Some friends and I get together every
now and then to play games. One, a game aficionado, has a bountiful
collection of games, so we regularly play new games. Some games we play
fairly regularly, some irregularly, and some once and never again.
Merchants of Amsterdam is one we've played once and never again. The
reason for this, I'm told explicitly, is because of my behaviour whilst
playing the game. It seems that something I consider tactical play,
others consider cheating. The point of contention, as it always seems to
be with The Merchants of Amsterdam, is with the bidding mechanism. With
four of us waiting around the board, watching the bidding clock tick
down towards lower and lower values, I would, at certain times, move my
hand as if to "stop the clock" and make a bid. The intended effect of
this was to compel other players to make their bid earlier than they
otherwise would have and it often worked. My fellow game players were
quite upset with my strategy and equated my actions to cheating. Upon
referring to the rule book, there was no information concerning a
correct procedure for touching the bidding clock, so it was clear I was
not breaking any explicit rules. My opponents then turned their attack
upon my behaviour in regard to the expected standards of behaviour
according to the expectations of engaging with the magic circle. I
believe that what I was doing was performing a "feint"---a movement made
in order to deceive, which is a perfectly legitimate tactical move in
Tauel Harper The Smooth Spaces of Play symplokeˉ 139 fencing, chess, Go,
football, and pretty much all tactical engagements. In doing so, [I was
viewing our magic circle to be a smooth space which was delineated from
social space---which allowed for, and in essence encouraged, a diverse
range of strategies and tactics.]{.underline} My critics were viewing
the magic circle as a striated space, where behaviour needed to be
moderated and ordered so that we may finish the game while retaining
respect for one another. What has ensued from that game, played almost
twelve months ago, is a constant negotiation and re-negotiation between
these two points. Some of the main turning points of this to-and-fro
have arisen from the arguments that I was not creating striations
through my actions---I was not determining the actions of other players
in a definitive manner. One form of the protest I faced was that my acts
physically excluded the possibility of other players from playing the
game. If I had the desire or ability to fend off other players from the
clock, I would have been striating the space "closing off a space and
allocating it according to determinate intervals" (Deleuze and Guattari
2004, 530). I thoroughly agree that such action would have resulted in
an impoverished game experience and a reduction of play. However, I did
not perform such an action and considering the physical effort required,
I simply could not. Another, similar argument was made that while I may
not have been physically "controlling" the space around the timer, I was
psychologically controlling the space and, hence, being somewhat
unsporting. It is at these points where the concepts of Euclidean and
Reimanian space are most relevant as the problem with these kinds of
arguments is that they presuppose a uniformity over intent,
psychological disposition and normalcy. Such an anticipation of
uniformity, I argue, is anathema to smooth spaces and good game playing.
Furthermore, when regarding political issues and game playing, the
expectation of uniformity is precisely the thing which undermines the
emancipative potential of playing games. I would argue that [the magic
circle exists as both smooth and striated space]{.underline}---[it is
necessarily transgressive enough to allow and facilitate difference but
not so transgressive as to preclude meaningful connection]{.underline}.
It is precisely the negotiation between these two understandings of the
magic circle which gives rise to the negotiation which can "smooth
things over." For instance, the "smoothing over" that has taken place
due to playing Merchants of Amsterdam has resulted in meaningful
communication about personal boundaries, ethics, strategies, and
tactics; it has promoted deep reflection on the meaning of the magic
circle and the reason why we play. As my fellow players are also games
theorists, this transgression has produced two conference papers, this
article, and an emotionally charged academic debate. These results may
not be as important as fostering a relationship of understanding between
two estranged nations, but [the process of creating a smooth space
continues to be a productive process]{.underline}. Furthermore, [the
process of negotiating the meaning and limits of the magic circle has
enabled a construction of a new relationship and
understanding]{.underline} between me and my game playing friends. 140
[The reason that [play has a political overtone]{.mark} is [that]{.mark}
it [can reconfigure a striated space to be]{.mark} a [smooth]{.mark}
on]{.underline}e. This is in line with Deleuze and Guattari's suggestion
that What interests us in operations of striation and smoothing are
precisely the passages or combinations: how the forces at work within
space continually striate it, and how in the course of its striation it
develops other forces and emits new smooth spaces. (2004, 551) In spaces
of play such as foreplay, crossing the magic circle can quickly
eliminate the sense of trust and possibility that are largely
responsible for the "play" situation; whereas in games such as Monopoly,
it's often the case that transgressing the magic circle (stealing from
the banker, forming alliances, and doing "under the table" deals) is the
only activity which generates any enjoyment. This is reflected in real
life "breakthough" moments in which personal and professional
expectations are sometimes shattered but which require a renegotiation
of relation---such situations are always pregnant with the possibility
of developing new understandings and producing productive results.
Deleuze and Guattari are instructive in helping to understand what makes
play progressive in a political sense, and they add a level of
sophistication to debates about the role of the magic circle. Whereas
Stalin's game players were bound by a magic circle, this did not make
their play emancipative because their magic circle was dominated by the
striations of universality (productivity as the only measure of
success). While Iran and Australia did not believe they could relate to
each other, the playing of a game in 1997 enabled connections to be
uncovered and highlighted admirable aspects of the adversaries,
resulting in smoother relations between nations. Despite the fact that
the Cloudmakers had developed their community in response to a
well-defined magic circle, they had the potential to transgress that
striation and direct their capacity to new and unrelated events---until,
that is, people once again started imposing their universal striations
("This is not a game!"). Similarly, [my transgressions in Merchants of
Amsterdam]{.underline}, while admittedly not flattering to my nature as
a player inside the magic circle, [produced insights, relationships, and
freely formed production outside of the magic circle.]{.underline} [It
is in the very nature of play to **experiment with transgressions**,
facilitate community, and to have fun]{.underline}. The magic circle can
be seen as a wonderful device to create the conditions in which to
pursue these goals but, at the same time, we should realise that
[[transgressing that circle "to smooth things over"can]{.mark} have a
lasting and positive [impact]{.mark} upon the way in which
[politics]{.mark} takes place]{.underline}.1

#### Disavowal of the potential for activism within the debate space reifies Cartesian dualisms -- knowledge is not disembodied but partisan and oriented. Saying debate is a game misses the point -- the liberatory potential of the university entails a militant research that produces new perceptions of the world. Exclusion of the 1ac's scholarship reproduces capitalism and ignores the affective potential for change.

Although the outcomes of the research are not of direct concern to this
paper, [it is inevitably impossible (and perhaps both undesirable and
inconsistent with the militant ethnographic approach) to wholly
disentangle the content from the process of the research]{.underline}.
Fundamentally, [this is because [the process of research]{.mark} (and me
as researcher) [cannot be alienated from the 'object' of]{.mark} [the
research]{.mark} concern]{.underline} (Colectivo Situaciones 2003 2005).
Beginning from within, I understood [militant ethnography -- as a form
of militant research -- as the process of gradually identifying and
becoming fixated on a contradiction]{.underline}, inconsistency or
paradox [within an overtly politicised milieu]{.underline}, [and then
striving to understand and contribute to the collective surpassing of
this paradox]{.underline} -- [a combination of thought and action
orientated towards understanding and changing collective
praxis]{.underline}, identifying and surpassing the limits of our
existing selves. Throughout my 'militant research' orientation (immanent
research, perhaps?), many of the concerns associated with the
activist/academic problematic were incomprehensible -- somehow offset,
negated or confused by the militant approach. From the outset, there
existed no 'critical distance' between me -- as some hypothetically
pre‐existing 'researcher' -- and the 'object' of my research. I could
not make sense of 'going native' (Fuller 1999), for I was never
'outside' of this milieu in the first place -- I was researching in the
middle of where I was. I was not concerned with finding processes to
'link my intellectual and political concerns' (Juris 2008a, 20), as they
had never been separate (and in any case, what value is the 'intellect'
when separated from the 'political\'?). There existed no 'third space'
that I felt compelled to navigate between an 'activist' field and
'elsewhere' (although I shared Routledge\'s concern with 'research and
theory \[that\] remain\[s\] analytical and disembodied'; 1996, 401).
[[Militant research]{.mark} -- as an orientation -- [is]{.mark} thus in
many ways [a rejection of the]{.mark} entire problematic of the
[activist/academic]{.mark}]{.underline}, or more accurately, [[it is a
subjective orientation towards research in which the 'academic'
component is irrelevant]{.mark} precisely [because militant research
does not take the university as a referent]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the
first instance, [militant research is irrespective of the university and
the attendant subject of the academic]{.underline}. Instead, [all forms
of militant research are concerned with 'the capacity for struggles to
read themselves and, consequently, to recapture and disseminate the
advances and productions of other social practices ']{.underline}
(Colectivo Situaciones 2003) -- militant research is thus the conscious
and deliberate attempt to make movements move through a reflexive
(dialectical, even?) critique of their own praxis. In a subtle
distinction between this paper and other thoughtful contributions to the
activist/academic debate, my starting point was not therefore to
negotiate the relationship between being both an 'activist' and an
'academic'. Rather, I approached and experienced the institution -- as
I\'m sure many others have -- as someone attempting to contribute to the
critical transformation of a movement in which I was already a
constitutive actor. Through expanding on my research experience, I shall
suggest that [[militant research is]{.mark} both [an orientation]{.mark}
and process [that allows us to reappraise the problematic of
activism/academia]{.mark}.]{.underline} Speaking personally, it has
become most obviously a question of how does one survive within the
university, both when in the process of militant research, and when one
is not in the process of militant research. The paper thus concludes
with an initial consideration of how [the orientation and process of
militant research is concomitant with developing a normative position
regarding the very function of the university, demanding we ask not what
the university is but what we want it to do.]{.underline} Militant
research as orientation [[People]{.mark} in therapeutic systems, or in
the universities, [who consider themselves to be]{.mark} mere
depositories or [channels for]{.mark} the transmission of [scientific
knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}, have already made a reactionary choice.
Despite their innocence or goodwill, they really [occupy a position that
[reinforce]{.mark}s the systems of [production of the dominant
subjectivity]{.mark}]{.underline}. It does not have to be this way.
(Guattari and Rolnik 2008, 41) It may seem frustrating (at best) when
the response to the question of what a militant researcher actually does
is 'It depends, and besides, what I did might be completely
inappropriate in another context', or even more confusingly, 'You do
what needs to be done'. On first impression these responses appear as
somewhat slippery apologies, yet they are both wholly appropriate and
accurate -- the problem lies with the presuppositions of the question.
[[Militant research is]{.mark} not an 'off‐the‐shelf' set of techniques
for measuring, recording and assessing the world according to academic
standards]{.underline}, **[but rather [an orientation and a
process]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [What occurs during the militant
research is wholly contingent]{.underline}, demanding attention to the
changing necessities of the milieu within which one is situated. The
militant research 'orientation' has a long if somewhat irregular history
that finds its roots in Marx\'s (1880) Workers\' inquiry -- an extended
survey directed at the French working class -- which was later developed
by those involved with the Italian Operaismo of the 1960s and 1970s (see
Malo 2004; The Commune 2011). More recently, groups such as Precarias a
la Deriva (2004), Colectivo Situaciones (2003 2005) and Team Colors
(2010) have also experimented with militant research. While the forms of
research are very different, what they arguably share is a specific
orientation that is grounded in a commitment to the augmentation and
transformation of the movements of which they are part. In many ways,
the question of orientation is at the heart of the debate regarding
whether there is something that can be properly considered a 'feminist
method' (see Harding 1987a 1987b; Reinharz and Davidman 1992; Sharp
2005; Naples 2007). For Harding, it was essential to make a distinction
between epistemology ('a theory of knowledge'), methodology ('a theory
and analysis of how research does or should proceed') and method ('a
technique for ... gathering evidence'). In Harding\'s schema, the
fundamental question of what constitutes 'feminist' research must take
place at the level of epistemology, as it is these decisions that
influence how we define our roles as researchers, what we consider
ethical research practices, and we interpret and implement informed
consent or ensure the confidentiality of our research subjects. (Naples
2007, 547) In other words, questions regarding 'method' are secondary to
the question of the orientation of the research. [The importance of
considering orientation stems from the disavowal of the positivist
position that it is possible to produce knowledge that is somehow
neutral]{.underline}, and by extension, supporting the assertion that
whether one acknowledges it or not, **[[all knowledge is inherently
partisan knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Without extensively
rehearsing this argument, the critique of positivist epistemology -- and
thus the inherent need to consider orientation -- can be summarised
through contrasting interpretations of research as either 'truth
relaying' or 'knowledge production'. John Berger\'s (1972) essay Ways of
seeing usefully rehearses this distinction through perspectives on the
photographic process. [A positivist perspective holds that the
photograph provides an unquestionably objective account of the
world]{.underline}, while the act of taking a photograph is a
(scientific) process of 'truth relaying'. '[Good' research will strive
to minimise noise, variables and unintended acts of distortion so as to
ensure the photograph provides as 'truthful' account of the
world]{.underline} as is possible -- in other words, they will ensure
some form of methodological rigour (see Baxter and Eyles 1997). To the
contrary, Berger argues that: [[photographs are not]{.mark}, as is often
assumed[, a mechanical record]{.mark}. Every time we look at a
photograph, we are aware, however slightly, of the photographer
selecting that sight]{.underline} from an infinity of other possible
sights. This is true even in the most casual family snapshot. [[The
photographer\'s way of seeing is reflected in]{.mark} his [choice of
subject]{.mark}]{.underline}. (1972, 8, 10) Rather than interpreting the
photograph as the presentation of truth, we must understand [the act of
taking a photograph as the production of a very specific and orientated
knowledge. [The act of decision between what is 'relevant' to the image
and what is not]{.mark}, and what is rendered as 'noise' or 'distortion'
rather than relevant information, [is an unavoidable
act]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [To claim that the photograph is a
mere 'transmission of truth']{.underline} is to either hide or apologise
for the photographer, an audacious attempt to remove the photographer
from the existence of the photograph. [This is nothing but an
illusion]{.underline}. [[To believe the photographer does not exist is
to reproduce]{.mark} the [dominant]{.mark} (yet flawed) [understanding
of knowledge as disembodied]{.mark}]{.underline}, impartial and
universal, [reinforcing precisely the 'systems of production of the
dominant subjectivity']{.underline} (Guattari and Rolnik 2008, 41) that
are the wrath of any progressive cosmology. [To accept that the
photograph is essentially inseparable from the photographer is to accept
the photograph as both a situated statement on and intervention in the
world, an attempt to portray and affect the world in certain
ways]{.underline} -- whether one claims (or realises) to be doing so or
not. As Orwell suggests, 'consciously or unconsciously everyone writes
as a partisan' (2003, 195). We can thus understand Roseneil\'s claim
that we should have 'no qualms about rejecting "value‐neutrality" and
taking sides' (1993, 179); it is a given that all knowledge is
orientated, such that even those who claim to be producing scientific,
disembodied knowledge 'about' the world are themselves reproducing the
dominant subjectivity. The question must thus be rethought as which side
do you choose to take; do you choose to reproduce the dominant way of
seeing/knowing? Or do you choose to align with an antagonistic
perspective that knows the world differently? What, then, can we
understand of militant research as orientation? The process of militant
research necessarily 'starts from the understandings, experiences, and
relations generated through organising as both a method of political
action and as a form of knowledge' (Shukaitis and Graeber 2007, 9). To
this extent, [[the militant researcher is]{.mark} orientated as a
constitutive participant within a given politicised milieu -- they are
[immanent to]{.mark} a field of [political desires and the
heterogeneous]{.mark} yet resonant [bodies within
this]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is impossible to think of this as 'going
native' (see Fuller 1999), which suggests a researcher is somehow
'coming' from a foreign or alien outside. [The researcher begins
orientated within and as part of the milieu of the
research]{.underline}, the 'inquirer her/himself \[is\] placed in the
same critical plane as the overt subject matter' (Harding 1987a, 9) --
[the [self/other]{.mark}, researcher/researched [binaries collapse in on
themselves]{.mark}.]{.underline} Given this orientation, what therefore
is the 'photographic act\'? Or to put it another way, how does one go
about knowledge production when orientated through militant research? Or
again, what do we now mean by research? As Nate Holdren has suggested,
this is wholly contingent on the research milieu: One experience of
research militancy can find the techniques and experiences of another to
be either a resource to draw upon and redeploy, something relatively
inert and not useful, or something incompatible to and actively
destructive for its own project, an object lesson to avoid. (2006, no
page) Although beyond the scope of this paper -- and thus an invitation
for discussion elsewhere -- this opens a Pandora\'s box for those who
fetishise participatory methods as some form of Golden Ticket to
progressive, respectful or sensitive forms of research. If we accept
that the question of 'method' is subordinate to the question of
orientation, we also have the basis for critiquing 'participation' as a
fetishised object. It is beyond question that 'militant research' may
utilise participatory methods, but that is not to imply that
participatory methods are inherently 'radical' or 'progressive'
(Autonomous Geographies Collective 2010, 249). Indeed, the value of
'participation' resides more at the level of orientation and process
than it does at the level of method. [We should therefore approach the
partisan construction of knowledge 'exactly like a toolbox', in the
sense that the [production of knowledge is]{.mark} literally the
[production of tools that]{.mark} modify, enhance or [create]{.mark}
[new ways of]{.mark} seeing and enable new ways of [affecting the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}. Paraphrasing Proust, knowledge(s) should be
approached and used 'like a pair of glasses to view the outside, and if
it isn\'t to your liking, find another pair, or invent your own, and
your device will necessarily be a device you can fight with' (Deleuze
and Foucault 2004, 208). Given these reflections, an appropriate
response to the question of what a militant researcher actually does
would be 'you\'re missing the point'. Nonetheless, the question still
stands -- what does a militant researcher actually do? While impossible
to give an absolute answer to this (just as it is impossible to give a
conclusive answer as to what a feminist researcher actually does), I can
speak personally of my experience of conducting militant ethnography
within elements of the radical climate and climate justice movements.
Militant ethnography as process For multiple reasons, the second‐half of
2008 can be retrospectively understood as the impetus behind the
militant research undertaken within the radical climate and climate
justice movements. I had been charged under the UK\'s Malicious Damages
Act for my participation in a high‐profile environmental direct action
concerning emissions from coal‐burning, resulting in a long court case
that demanded extensive reflection and justification of our collective
action. The Camp for Climate Action (CfCA) -- one of the most visible
elements of the UK\'s radical climate movement -- had recently held a
protest camp at Kingsnorth power station, and was at the beginning of
considering its direction for the following year while reflecting on the
'politics' of its process. Following the first international meeting of
the network, which later became known as Climate Justice Action (CJA),
an international 'call to action' had been circulated in mid‐September
calling for mass mobilisations surrounding the COP15 summit at the end
of 2009 -- a call supported by the CfCA at its September national
gathering. The intersection of these nameable events -- alongside a
multitude of other less visible discussions, perspectives and
inspirations -- began to ignite a concern with the praxis of the
movement. It was no longer self‐evident to all movement actors that the
ways 'we' in the radical climate movement(s) knew/acted upon climate
change represented a significantly 'radical' praxis, or that this was
substantively different to the tendency of the mainstream environmental
movement. While there had been some discussions and publications that
spoke back to the movement regarding this 'liberal' tendency (Archer
2007; Abbott 2009; Cambridge Anarchists 2009; Resonance 2009), these
critiques remained undeveloped despite their fundamental importance to
how 'we' attempted to situate ourselves as 'radical' political actors.
It would be facetious to claim there was some light‐bulb moment at which
this paradox suddenly emerged fully formed, or that there was a neat
linearity between the generation of the 'question' followed by a
'research process' intent on finding the answer. Rather, Deleuze\'s
suggestion that 'the art of constructing a problem is very important:
[you invent a problem, a problem‐position, before finding a
solution]{.underline}' (Deleuze and Parnet 2006, 1), provides a far more
accurate account of the labour of this militant research process. This
process was thus directed towards understanding and constructing this
problem‐position -- of interrogating and constructing an understanding
of the shortcomings of 'our' praxis -- with the intention of surpassing
and overcoming them. In other words, [the intention of the research was
to contribute to the interpretation and transformation of the praxis of
movement, to contribute to making the movement move.]{.underline} The
extent to which militant research can be deemed successful is thus
measured solely by the extent to which it had some effect on the
movement milieu. In practice, it is highly problematic to measure the
degree to which this research was successful, not least because an
attempt to contribute to transforming the praxis of a movement
necessarily means challenging some elements of our praxis. To those
movement actors intent on more of the same, such a research contribution
may be an annoying or potentially destructive distraction from the task
at hand, and thus perhaps dismissible as intellectual waffle or a waste
of time. On the other hand, there will be movement actors who will be
receptive to such reflexive contributions, those who will take up the
problem‐position and collectively look for new praxes that respond and
surpass it. [Militant research is thus a process of being critically
committed to a given political milieu -- at once committed to the milieu
through critical attempts to transform it]{.underline}. The intention is
not to take detached, static and explanatory snap‐shots -- like much of
'social movement theory' (for example, Tarrow 1998) -- nor is it to
uncritically reaffirm the goals and processes of a given political
tendency (see Chatterton et al. 2007). Rather [the point of militant
research is to contribute to processes of critical reflection and
transformation of our movements.]{.underline} In practice, [militant
ethnography -- as a form of militant research -- meant adopting multiple
forms throughout the researc]{.underline}h. Similar to research
conducted by Routledge (2008 2009) and Juris (2007 2008a 2008b), this
resulted in attendance and participation in national organisational
gatherings, coordinating workshops, facilitating information sessions,
writing funding applications, discussions on e‐lists, coordinating
publicity, arranging mass coach transportation to mobilisations, helping
refurbish squatted convergence spaces, distributing literature,
participating and speaking on protests, and so on. In other words, my
participation was wholly contingent on the nature of the specific
political milieu within which I was a constitutive participant. Through
these actions was an ongoing reflexive process of discourse analysis,
participant observation and affective awareness that -- recalling that
the research/researched binary has collapsed through the militant
research orientation -- could be considered a sort of 'collective
autoethnography'. When de‐jargoned, [this meant that while
[listening]{.mark}, conspiring, [reading]{.mark}, [planning]{.mark},
writing, laughing [and]{.mark} celebrating along with friends and
comrades within the movement]{.underline}, I was concomitantly
developing both my own and others\' understanding of this
'problem‐position'. [This was manifest both in terms of [how I]{.mark}
therefore acted or [spoke]{.mark}, what I would do (or not do) and why I
would try and [effect]{.mark} [decisions]{.mark} or processes in certain
ways.]{.underline} On an observable level, this meant 'formal'
reflections on the movement, including publications in movement journals
such as Shift (Russell 2010), open‐source anarchist journals widely
syndicated across 'movement' websites (Russell and Pusey 2010) and a
collectively authored and edited book(let) (Building Bridges Collective
2010). Although fetishised within academia, [these formal reflections
may be less significant to making movements move than the ephemeral
outburst in a meeting]{.underline}, a shared reflection over a beer or
indeed the choice to abstain from a given meeting or action. Militant
research in/against/beyond the university As stated earlier, militant
research in the first instance is irrespective of the university and the
attendant subject of the academic. To that extent, I have explored how I
experienced militant research as both an orientation and a process, and
outlined how [I utilised a mixed ethnographic approach to knowledge
production immanent to a political milieu]{.underline}. From a militant
research orientation, [the problematic is thus not so much navigating
the duality of activism/academia, but to what extent one can conduct
militant research within the university.]{.underline} In his influential
discussion on the experience of conducting activist research, Paul
Routledge considered himself as 'consciously acting as an activist and a
researcher at the same time', necessitating a 'difficult and unstable'
negotiation between his 'roles as "activist" and "geographer" ' (1996,
405) -- yet this is to conflate 'research' and the 'academy'. Throughout
my experience of militant research, and despite my best attempts, I have
struggled to empathise with this position. The assertion that 'the
voices of those involved in struggles are distinct from the social
science literature that seeks to study and explain such struggles'
(1996, 406) is undoubtedly correct, yet the problem lies not in
maintaining and negotiating this distinction, but in ensuring one is
conducting research as a subject orientated through struggle, rather
than as an 'academic' producing disembodied -- 'dead' -- information
about movements. [Militant research dissolves the
perspective]{.underline} that 'activism' and 'research' are somehow
opposed, a refutation of the idea [that activism is some form of
uncritical mindless 'campaigning' whereas research is armchair
'intellectual' work]{.underline} (something perpetuated by many
self‐defining 'activists' and 'academics' alike). This distinction is
itself a hangover of the positivist perspective that intellectual work
is the act of revealing disembodied truth, and that it takes a
specialist or expert (the academic) to produce this disembodied
knowledge. What is in opposition is therefore [the academic as
positivist‐researcher -- 'those who see themselves as channels for the
transmission of scientific information']{.underline} (Guattari and
Rolnik 2008, 41) -- [and the task of being critically committed to
producing partisan knowledge that is situated within political milieus.
There is no possible negotiation between undertaking orientated
'knowledge production' on the one hand, and being an official
'transmitter of truth' on the other]{.underline} -- a commitment to the
first necessarily discredits the second. As suggested by the Autonomous
Geographies Collective, 'the most important principle for academics
committed to social change is to make strategic interventions
collectively with the social movements we belong to' (2010, 247). If
this is the positive image of what we want the academic to do, then by
extension it means reimagining the university not as an institution of
elites 'trained' in some 'science' of truth‐relaying, but rather as an
institution fundamentally geared towards establishing and surpassing the
problem‐positions of everyday life. [The university should become an
amplification chamber where quotidian experience is enabled to read
itself]{.underline}, where non‐experts are supported in intervening in
the conditions of their own lives.1 One is left with a simple
perspective on the contemporary university; to the extent that it is
possible, [we should exploit the few remaining 'cracks' (Holloway 2010)
that allow us to live while contributing to antagonistic social
change]{.underline} -- both [through teaching and research]{.underline}.
Yet it is clear that the university, at least in the UK, is fast
approaching a state of disrepair following a sustained assault through
the 'neoliberal lens'. An ever‐expanding exploited and precarious
workforce (Grove 2013), [the [devaluation of research]{.mark} [that does
not demonstrate an 'impact' within]{.mark} the present
[framework]{.mark} of the possible]{.underline} (see Harvie and De
Angelis 2009; Rogers et al. 2014) [[and]{.mark} the [transformation of
'education' into a process]{.mark} of producing indentured
entrepreneurial subjects]{.underline} (see Lazzarato 2012) [[are]{.mark}
significantly [reducing]{.mark} the number of ['cracks' left within the
academic institution.]{.mark}]{.underline} To the extent that it is
possible, [[we should]{.mark} seek to counteract those forces and
**[reimagine the university as a politicised machine that works to
produce]{.mark} and amplify different [perceptions]{.mark}** [of the
world]{.mark}, to find ways to interrupt and change the rules of
everyday life]{.underline}. We must challenge (and fight) over the very
function of the university. 'Demand the Impossible!' should become the
rationale of the academy, [where 'impact' is understood as the capacity
for teaching and research to disrupt, discredit and dismantle the
post‐political malaise that dominates the 'West']{.underline} (see
Swyngedouw 2005), [and instead open up new possibilities for hope in
what the future(s) could look like]{.underline}.
