# Leverage CPs -- East Asia

## Notes

NOTE #1 -- There are several distinct positions in this file. The
unifying theme is that they all argue that we should **use our arms
sales to countries in East Asia as a source of [leverage]{.underline}
rather than simply [reducing]{.underline} them outright**; the ways in
which they go about doing so, however, differ.

Specifically, they may be divided into **QPQ CPs** ("quid pro quo" is
Latin for "this for that", i.e. a bargain in which we trade X for Y)
that say we will **reduce our arms sales to country A if and only if
Country B does X**; and **Conditions CPs** that say we will **continue
our arms sales to Country A if and only if Country A does X.** There are
important differences between the two categories in terms of not only
the substantive arguments, but also the set of theoretical objections &
permutations/perm answers that make sense---So be careful!!

NOTE #2 -- There is also an important substantive division between
**Northeast Asia** (Taiwan, Japan, & South Korea) and the myriad of
countries in **Southeast Asia** -- they deal w/ a distinct set of
issues, so the CPs that deal with them are different, even if there's
some overlap in impacts or w/e. The file is organized accordingly, for
ease of navigation/use in responding to different AFFs.

NOTE #3 -- There are completed CPs vs the Affs being read at the DDI
(Japan BMD, Taiwan), and largely for Southeast Asia Affs. Importantly,
however, there are also the pieces & structure to help you get started
in developing similar CPs to deal with Korea Affs, other Japan Affs,
further fleshing this out as a strategy vs. Southeast Asia,
etc.---which, going into (and over the course of) the season, I would
**[strongly]{.underline}** recommend!!

**[File Organization]{.underline}**

\--Taiwan QPQ

\--Japan BMD QPQ

\--Materials to put together more Korea/Japan stuff

Southeast Asia

\--China QPQ---COC & ADIZ

\--HR Pressure Conditions

\--Materials to put together more SEA stuff

**[Summary of CPs]{.underline}**

**1 -- Quid Pro Quo (QPQ) CPs** (\*note: **Taiwan QPQ --** This CP
argues that we ought to offer to reduce our arms sales to Taiwan in
exchange for China taking a number of other steps that align with our
objectives in Northeast Asia, and only follow through on such a
reduction once they have done so.

**ROK / Japan QPQ --** Same structure, but for use against Affirmatives
that reduce arms sales to Japan or the Republic of Korea. (and Japan BMD
specifically)

**Code of Conduct (COC) and/or Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ)
QPQ --** Same structure, but for use against Affirmatives that reduce
arms sales to one or more countries in Southeast Asia.

**2 -- Conditions CPs**

**HR Pressure --** Threatens to reduce our arms sales to whatever
Southeast Asian country the Aff ends sales to. Most effective in the
case that the AFF makes a set of arguments about HR abuses, military
professionalization, stability, etc. in that country. You should say
that they will SAY YES, thus solving the advantage, but that the AFF
FAILS TO SOLVE because it eliminates our leverage for shaping their
behavior. (Additional plank(s) about changing their behavior in other
ways can be added for additional net benefit goodness.) If the AFF wins
SAY NO, then the CP results in the PLAN, thus still solving the whole
AFF; at that point your net benefit should be that the ACT OF
CONDITIONING is good for our credibility in other contexts (a la Stohl
17).

**\*Finally, a note---This one didn't quite come together in Generics
time, but would recommend that people put it together as another
option:**

**SEA Veto Conditions CP---**

This one is kinda weird: the CP has the US say that we will continue the
arms sales that the plan ends ONLY if everyone in Southeast Asia + China
says yes -- and then says that those countries will *[say
no]{.underline}*. This means that the CP results in the plan. The net
benefit is that us essentially giving those other countries a veto over
the plan's arms sales is good, because it complies with the SCS Code of
Conduct and signals that the COC has teeth/that the US understands
ourselves as bound by it (in other words: we should reduce *because they
told us to*, and *in response to* them telling us to, NOT because we
decide to do so ourselves for whatever reason).

### AT: Perm Do Both -- China Pockets

#### China will [pocket the concession]{.underline} -- the plan doesn't earn goodwill

**[Small]{.underline}**, Transatlantic Fellow, Asia Program, German
Marshall Fund of the United States, **[2012]{.underline}** (Andrew,
\"China\'s Response to the US \'Return to Asia\' Tour,\" *The EU-China
Relationship*, p. 131-132)

To describe the UIS as 'returning to Asia therefore seems misplaced, and
it is notable that it is a term most actively used by commentators and
[officials in China]{.underline}, who [are keen to imply that the
US]{.underline} role [is fickle]{.underline}, provisional and unnatural.
But the Obama administration was not above using a little of that
rhetoric itself in dramatising some of its early moves. Both the
Secretary of State and the President made symbolic early trips to the
region. Washington took steps to address perceptions that the UIS was
unwilling to put in summit face-time and unsupportive of the emerging
multilateral architecture, most importantly by signing ASEAN\'s Treaty
of Amity and Cooperation (TAC) and seeking membership of the East Asian
Summit (EAS). It consolidated initiatives such as the India partnership
that some feared may prove to be a one-administration shot. And it
expanded the US focus on Southeast Asia, the source of most of the
complaints about Washington \'neglecting the region.

Much of this was occluded in public perceptions, however, by the other
major focus of the Obama administration in Asia; upgrading bilateral
relations with China. [The view of some US policy makers was that
by]{.underline} forging consensus with Beijing on areas of global
concern and [taking a]{.underline} relatively [conciliatory stance on
areas of Chinese sensitivity]{.underline}, [it may be possible to
erode]{.underline} the pervasive [mistrust]{.underline} in the
relationship. Meetings with the Dalai Lama and arms sales to Taiwan
appeared to be slow-pedalled, attempts to find signature cooperation
projects on climate change were launched, and [US officials gave
speeches on the subject of]{.underline} [\'strategic
reassurance]{.underline}\'. The highpoint was supposed to be President
Obama\'s first visit to China in November 2009, which saw the release of
an unusually extensive joint statement spelling out an agenda for
bilateral cooperation. Speculation about a new \'G2\' in global affairs
reached its peak.

Whether this approach would have worked in other circumstances is a moot
point. With the economic crisis as a backdrop, [China]{.underline},
**[rather than seeing US gestures as farsighted and
magnanimous]{.underline}**, [treated them as symptoms of weakness and
decline]{.underline}. Chinese assertiveness had already been fanned by
the financial crisis, out of which it seemed to emerge as a relative
'winner\'. The first year of [the new administration confirmed an
emerging view in Beijing that its strengthened position **entitled it to
demand more of other countries**]{.underline}. The final months of 2009
acted as the denouement for this period in the US-China relationship.
President Obama\'s visit to China played poorly in the US press, which
contended that he had not been extended privileges that his predecessors
received. [Beijing seemed to **pocket concessions** from Washington
while **offering**]{.underline} almost **[nothing in
return]{.underline}**. From bilateral economic issues to Iran sanctions,
China rebuffed US requests virtually across the board. The culmination
was the COP15 talks in Copenhagen, where Beijing managed to raise
hackles not just with the substance of its position at the talks but
with its almost insulting manner, which seemed to portend an ugly period
of Chinese assertiveness ahead.

#### The perm has the [opposite effect]{.underline} of the counterplan -- it encourages war --

**[Glaser]{.underline}**, professor of political science at George
Washington University and international affairs and director of the
Elliott School\'s Institute for Security and Conflict Studies, Spring
**[2015]{.underline}**

(Charles L., \"A U.S.-China Grand Bargain?\" *International Security*
Volume 39, Number 4, Project Muse)

**[I]{.underline}**nternational **[r]{.underline}**elations
[theorists]{.underline} and policy commentators [have long warned of the
costs and risks of]{.underline} territorial [accommodation]{.underline}.
First, [there is the direct cost of the concession itself]{.underline},
that is, what the state loses by giving up the territory, measured in
terms of security, prosperity, ideological goals, prestige, and so on.
If the losses are larger than the risks of competition and war, then the
state should not employ a strategy of accommodation.

Second, and more complicated, [instead of satisfying the
adversary]{.underline}, territorial [accommodation could **enable or
encourage it to demand or forcibly pursue additional
concessions**]{.underline}. Whether these dangers exist depends on the
adversary's motives and the extent of its aims.
[Accommodation]{.underline} that might satisfy a greedy adversary with
limited aims [could]{.underline} instead [**increase the probability of
war** if the adversary has]{.underline} unlimited aims, or even limited
[aims that]{.underline} significantly [exceed the scope of the
concessions]{.underline}. [The state will]{.underline} almost [always
face some uncertainty about the nature and extent of the adversary's
aims]{.underline}, [so accommodation will rarely be risk
free]{.underline}.

[Given this uncertainty]{.underline}, territorial [accommodation can be
dangerous if it increases the adversary's ability to launch additional
challenges]{.underline}. Territorial concessions can enhance the
adversary's potential offensive capabilities by increasing its wealth or
access to critical resources, by providing it with territory that
enhances its ability to fight on the offensive, and by freeing up
military forces that were previously committed to challenging the
conceded territory. In addition, given uncertainty about the adversary's
aims, territorial accommodation can be dangerous if it decreases the
adversary's assessment of the state's credibility for defending its
interests, thereby increasing the adversary's willingness to launch
additional challenges.

The literature is divided on how a state's actions influence an
adversary's assessment of its credibility. [A key strand holds that a
state's credibility is connected across issues]{.underline}; [making
**unmatched concessions on one issue can reduce a state's credibility
for defending its other interests**]{.underline}.19 Although the
broadest version of this argument---concessions on any issue anywhere
damage a state's \[End Page 58\] credibility on all other issues
everywhere---seems implausible, a more conditional argument is logically
sound.20 Specifically, [concessions on an issue that an adversary
believes is similar along one or more dimensions to a second issue will
reduce the state's credibility for defending the second
issue]{.underline}. For a rational adversary, an opposing state's
credibility is directly related to its understanding of that state's
interest in the specific issue. The connectedness logic requires that
the adversary be uncertain about the nature or extent of the state's
interest in the two issues. The state's action on the first issue
provides the adversary with information about the extent of the state's
interest in that issue. In addition, because the two issues share
significant similarities, the action also can provide the adversary with
information about the extent of the state's interest in the second
issue. [The relevant dimensions along which issues can be similar
include geography]{.underline}; [the estimated magnitude of the
interest]{.underline}; [and]{.underline}, related but separable, [the
nature of the interest]{.underline} ([security]{.underline}, economic,
identity, etc.).

The opposing strand of the credibility debate holds that a state's past
actions do not influence its credibility. According to this line of
argument, credibility depends only on an opposing state's power and
interests, both of which are known, not on its past behavior.21 This
formulation, however, mischaracterizes the issue of credibility by
assuming that the adversary essentially knows the extent of the state's
interests. Uncertainty about the state's interests, however, lies at the
core of the adversary's uncertainty about the state's credibility. This
in turn creates a role for past actions to influence current assessments
of credibility. And, although the adversary may be nearly certain that
the state places an extremely high value on defending its homeland, the
adversary is likely to be more uncertain about the value that the state
places on defending its allies and lesser interests.

Given this uncertainty, if the adversary sees logical similarities
between the two issues, one would expect that a state's policy toward a
lesser (but possibly still important) interest would enable an adversary
to update its assessment of the state's interests and, in turn, of the
credibility of its commitments. For example, ending an alliance could
lead an adversary to reduce its assessment of how likely the state would
be to meet certain other alliance commitments. The magnitude of the
change would depend on the size of the accommodation, the \[End Page
59\] extent of uncertainties about the state's interests, and the
similarity between the terminated and the continuing alliances. In
addition, [if the adversary believes that a structural change caused the
state to adopt accommodation]{.underline}, [it will]{.underline} see a
similarity across otherwise disparate issues that are affected by the
structural change and will, therefore, [reduce its assessment of the
state's credibility on all of these issues]{.underline}.

#### Unilateral concessions engender anger and insecurity -- reciprocity key

**[Goldstein]{.underline}**, associate professor and founding director,
China Maritime Studies Institute, U.S. Naval War College, May
**[2015]{.underline}**

(Lyle, *Meeting China Halfway*, pg. 333)

[The criticism]{.underline} sure to be [leveled]{.underline} at this
book [is]{.underline} that it allegedly advocates
"[appeasing]{.underline}" [China]{.underline}: [satisfying]{.underline}
many of [Beijing's long-standing gripes]{.underline} regarding the US
alliance system, [while only receiving]{.underline} "piddling" and
[unenforceable promises]{.underline} of enhanced transparency and
pressure on various partners (e.g., Iran) in return for Washington's
restraint. As noted in the book's introduction, [such
criticism]{.underline} tends to be ideological in nature and [is not
adequately attentive to the **reciprocal dynamics**]{.underline} of the
proposed cooperation cycles. [Not only are they intended to ensure
balanced]{.underline}, [two-way accommodation]{.underline}, but their
step-by-step nature assures that confidence is built in preliminary
"baby steps," before the major and more difficult steps are even
attempted. There is no built-in assumption, moreover, that steps are
irreversible, and some backsliding is practically inevitable given the
ambitious task of making progress on a multitude of complex issues
simultaneously. For American readers, a casual glance at some of the
compromise measures asked of Beijing within the cooperation cycles---
from agreeing to verification procedures for carbon emissions, to
accepting a midpoint delimitation in the East China Sea, to opening its
new giant naval base on Hainan Island to regular visits by personnel
from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), to legalizing
genuinely independent labor unions, to granting both Japan and India
permanent seats on the UN Security Council--- reveals that these
measures will hardly be easy concessions to which China can agree. It
must be stated emphatically: [There is **no argument**]{.underline} in
this book **[for unilateral concessions]{.underline}**. [Such an
arrangement would only **engender anger and insecurity**]{.underline}.

#### Accommodation makes China [less likely to give ground]{.underline}

**[Glaser]{.underline}**, professor of political science at George
Washington University and international affairs and director of the
Elliott School\'s Institute for Security and Conflict Studies, Spring
**[2015]{.underline}**

(Charles L., \"A U.S.-China Grand Bargain?\" *International Security*
Volume 39, Number 4, Project Muse)

[Accommodation]{.underline} on Taiwan [would carry a variety of costs
and risks for the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. The
first involves the potential costs to U.S. political and ideological
values. The United States has a significant interest in promoting and
protecting freedom and democracy around the globe. Cutting the U.S.
commitment to Taiwan would put these values at risk. If China were to
gain control \[End Page 72\] over Taiwan, its authoritarian government
might be unwilling to accept the political institutions and personal
freedoms that Taiwan's people currently enjoy. Many proponents of
preserving the U.S. commitment to Taiwan point to the importance of
protecting these values.77 I agree that these are important values and
that Washington should be reluctant to jeopardize them. Nevertheless,
states usually should, and usually do, give priority to their key
national security interests. The United States should not be an
exception: it should pursue these political and ideological interests
only if the risks to its national security are relatively small in
comparison.

The next set of potential risks concern U.S. security. [The first of
these involves]{.underline} possible [reductions in China's assessments
of the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates' [resolve for
protecting its interests in Northeast Asia]{.underline}. As discussed
earlier, territorial [accommodation can lead an adversary to doubt the
state's resolve to protect other interests,]{.underline} which is
dangerous if the state's concessions do not leave the adversary fully
satisfied.78 Two mechanisms could be at work here. [One mechanism
depends on China seeing a similarity across]{.underline} one or more
features of the potentially [connected interests]{.underline},
[including their geography]{.underline}, [the nature and extent of the
U.S. interests]{.underline}, and the U.S. history of involvement with
these interests. If China is uncertain about U.S. resolve to protect
Taiwan and other American interests, and [if China believes that similar
factors determine U.S. resolve to protect all]{.underline} of these
[interests]{.underline}, then [accommodation]{.underline} on Taiwan
[would reduce U.S. credibility]{.underline} elsewhere. The other
mechanism comes into play if China believes that U.S. accommodation on
Taiwan reflects a change in a factor that also affects U.S. decisions on
these other issues; in that case, U.S. credibility on these issues would
be reduced. The broad change that is currently most relevant is the
shifting balance of power, specifically, increasing Chinese military
capabilities in East Asia. [If China's leaders believe that the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [chose accommodation on
Taiwan in response to China's growing regional]{.underline} \[End Page
73\] [military capabilities]{.underline}, [then they would also
reasonably conclude that the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [could be expected to make concessions on other
regional issues as well]{.underline}.

These mechanisms are reflected in prominent arguments against
accommodation of Beijing on Taiwan. For example, Nancy Tucker and Bonnie
Glaser argue that "[China would respond to appeasement as
have]{.underline} virtually [all governments]{.underline}: [It would
conclude that a weaker **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[lacking vision and ambition could be pressured and
manipulated]{.underline}."79 Richard Bush argues, "[Should the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [concede to
Beijing]{.underline} on Taiwan, [the lessons that China would
learn]{.underline} about the intentions of the region's dominant power
[would]{.underline} likely [discourage moderation and accommodation on
other issues, like Korea or maritime East Asia.]{.underline}"80

These are powerful arguments, which the United States needs to take
seriously. There is a clear similarity across the disputes---they are
all located in East Asia. Thus, China could be expected to reason that
U.S. accommodation on one of these disputes indicates a greater
willingness to make concessions on all the others. Arguably, ending the
U.S. commitment to Taiwan might even lead China to believe that its
growing power will enable its leadership to convince the United States
to fully exit East Asia. In addition, China's view of the shifting
balance of power could reinforce these conclusions: many Chinese
officials believe that the shifting balance of power partly reflects the
failings of the U.S. domestic political system and the superiority of
the China's model of governance and development; the result is a new
international system in which China's growing power should generate
greater influence and the major powers should acknowledge its rising
status.81 [Because this transformation influences all issues in East
Asia]{.underline}, [U.S. accommodation]{.underline} on Taiwan [could
validate these expectations and put other U.S. interests at greater
risk]{.underline}.

#### Unilateral concessions fail -- no solvency for the worst-case scenario

**[Fredman]{.underline}**, Boston University, **[2015]{.underline}**

(Zachary, USC US-China Institute,
http://china.usc.edu/goldstein-meeting-china-halfway-how-defuse-emerging-us-china-rivalry-2015)

In sum, Goldstein argues that [China must adjust]{.underline} some of
its long-held claims, increase the transparency of its national security
apparatus, and press countries like North Korea and Iran to conform to
international norms. [The **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [should **reciprocate** by drawing back some of
its military deployments]{.underline} and military engagement
activities, including trimming its force of aircraft carriers. He admits
that hardly any of the compromises he suggests will be easy. Leaders in
both countries must show bravery and avoid popular China-bashing and
America-bashing. Washington needs to also resist pressure from Asian
allies to take a more forceful stance against China. Exercising
restraint and dealing with China as an equal will not be easy, but as
Goldstein concludes, there is no other way.

[Meeting China Halfway **never calls for unilateral
concessions**]{.underline}, and none of his policy proposals are set in
stone. Gradualism, reciprocity, and mutual compromise are the core
principles of his approach. [As his **painstaking research
demonstrates**]{.underline}, [a very substantial number of Chinese
scholars and strategists want to work constructively with the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. However, if US
policymakers opt for containment rather than engagement, then China\'s
own hawks will carry the day in Beijing. [A new cold war will undermine
**regional stability** and decrease the chances for US-China cooperation
across the board]{.underline}. Goldstein concedes that [Washington must
**hedge against the worst-case scenario**]{.underline}, but to make this
hedge the central thrust of US China policy would be a colossal mistake.

#### U.S. credibility key to enforce the bargain -- deterrence and assurance links take out perm solvency

**[Glaser]{.underline}**, professor of political science at George
Washington University and international affairs and director of the
Elliott School\'s Institute for Security and Conflict Studies, Spring
**[2015]{.underline}**

(Charles L., \"A U.S.-China Grand Bargain?\" *International Security*
Volume 39, Number 4, Project Muse)

[A grand bargain would not constitute the entirety of U.S.
policy]{.underline}---unilateral measures and [alliances would remain
essential]{.underline} components of the United States' policy toward
Northeast Asia. [When uncertain about an adversary's
motives]{.underline} or when facing a state with mixed motives---a
combination of security seeking and greed---[a state should pursue a mix
of]{.underline} [cooperative and competitive policies]{.underline}.107
Maintaining and enhancing U.S. commitments to the region would provide
some of the necessary balance in the overall policy of the United
States. [These components of U.S. policy]{.underline} would be necessary
and appropriate even if China were unwilling to make the types of
concessions discussed above, but they [would become **even more
important in the context of a grand bargain**]{.underline}. [The key
challenge is for the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[to sustain its credibility for protecting its allies]{.underline}. As
already discussed, to help accomplish this, the United States could
commit additional forces to the region, forward deploy larger forces,
invest more in overall U.S. military capabilities, and increase the
integration of alliance military planning. [These measures
would]{.underline} provide the additional benefits of helping to offset
increases in China's military power and to [sustain the grand bargain by
enhancing the **U.S. ability to deter China from breaking the
agreement**]{.underline}. There is a potential downside, however:
increased U.S. capabilities would likely appear threatening to China.
But this danger would be reduced by America's ending its commitment to
Taiwan because a U.S. buildup would no longer threaten this vital
Chinese interest and would therefore be more clearly intended only to
defend U.S. allies. If, however, China wants to push the United States
out of the East Asia, then it would be strongly opposed to, and provoked
by, these measures. In this case, though, given the priority that U.S.
grand strategy places on preserving the \[End Page 82\] United States'
alliances in East Asia, increasing U.S. capabilities would enhance its
security.

[Weapons transfers are **intimately linked** to foreign policy and grand
strategy because they **reveal information**]{.underline} [about the
**political relationship** between the sender and receiver. To actors in
the international system, weapons are **credible** **signals**
of]{.underline} [**alignment** and **intentions**]{.underline},
[**even** when the weapon does **not affect the relative balance of
power**. State **leaders** and **policymakers** have **long observed**
that weapons transfers have effects beyond the military balance.
Scholarly assessments of the consequences of arms transfers have **not
incorporated** this insight, and thus reaches contradictory
conclusions]{.underline}: arms might increase the likelihood of
conflict, or decrease it; arms might build alliance trust, or they might
undermine it; or, they might have no independent effect on state
behavior whatsoever.54 I argue that [weapons]{.underline} affect a
state's military power and [send signals about the relationship between
the sending and receiving state. The signals sent by weapons transfers
help states **differentiate** between **close friends**]{.underline},
[acquaintances, and **opponents** in a manner that is **clear and
comprehensible** in an **otherwise noisy** international system. These
political signals have **observable effects** on a state's **foreign
policy behavior**]{.underline}. Weapons are intimately linked to grand
strategy and foreign policy because they create two types of power.55
Weapons most clearly provide material power, enabling a state to more
credibly make coercive threats or undertake forceful diplomatic actions
because of increased capabilities. [Weapons transfers are]{.underline}
also [**signals** of **political ties**]{.underline}, which creates a
more diffuse, relational power. Weapons transfers signal the extent and
depth of states' political alignments, and can even sort states in
intra-group status hierarchies. Weapons transfers are [**bright lines**
against the **noisy (and sticky) background** that is state's broader
political networks. They affect the shape of and tensions in the
network. State leaders **use** the ties created by weapons transfers as
a **convenient shortcut** for **understanding how states are related**
to one another]{.underline}, where the center of power is located, and
the relative power of one group of states compared to another. In
focusing on the signals sent by weapons transfers, I show, for example,
that some transfers facilitate cooperation, while other transfers
incentivize prevention or aggression. These foreign policy outcomes,
determined by [the signal sent by weapons transfers]{.underline}, more
generally show the importance of the symbols and signals that [make and
**unmake relations**]{.underline} that constitute world politics. As the
following empirical chapters show, without an analysis of the political
effects of weapons transfers, explanations of international political
outcomes are incomplete. Chapter three, on India and Pakistan, shows how
weapons transfers can moderate a revisionist state's impulses to take
advantage of its weakened neighbor. The chapter on the Middle East
offers a revised explanation for the 1967 war, focusing on the arms
transfers that fueled uncertainty about political relationships. Chapter
five demonstrates how weapons transfers expand foreign policy options
available to states by allowing them to hold on to otherwise
contradictory relationships. The US used transfers to simultaneously
reassure Taiwan and deter China -- the foundation of the policy of
strategic ambiguity. Finally, [chapter six shows that states **remain
sensitive** to and interested in arms signals **even** when the state
can **produce its own** weapons]{.underline}. [These cases are specific
instances of more general patterns in which weapons transfers have a
**causal effect** on state behavior]{.underline}. It is **[these
political effects]{.underline}**, and how they [**explain** **foreign
policy decisions**]{.underline}, that are the focus of the remainder of
this chapter. This chapter develops an explanation of foreign policy
behavior based on signals sent through international conventional
weapons transfers. First, I situate my discussion of arms as signals
within existing scholarship. Second, [I go beyond existing literature by
explicitly and systematically building a theory of the political effects
of weapons transfers]{.underline}. Third, I discuss scope conditions for
this theory. Fourth, I show the broader theoretical significance of this
theory with respect to foreign policy, signaling, and hierarchies in
international security. I conclude with a discussion of case selection
and concept analysis. What do weapons do for a state? While existing
literature acknowledges that states can seek weapons for purposes beyond
relative capabilities, there is not yet a coherent description of the
political effects of arms transfers. Scholarship generally treats
"conventional weapons" as a monolithic category, overlooking differences
between planes, tanks, and ICBMs. Any first step toward creating a
typology of weapons must therefore take into account the different
functions and perceptions of weapons. Weapons quite obviously affect
relative capabilities. Greater capabilities give a state increased
ability to coerce its adversaries or to conduct military operations.
However, the effects of capabilities are not universal. A tank enables a
very different type of fighting than long-range bombers; a refueling
plane is quite different from a submarine. A logical first cut for
differentiating among types of weapons is based on their military
utility. Second, scholars have a sense that weapons can be acquired for
reasons other than relative capabilities, but have not explored these
purposes. With the exception of ambiguous statements that some weapons
are more "symbolic" than others, non-military reasons for weapons
acquisition are, in the conventional realm, largely ignored. Linguistic
politics approaches suggest the salient point of information is the name
of the weapon,56 whereas others have argued the weapon itself is a
symbol, and that supersonic aircraft are particularly notable because
they are "expensive, visible, and get a great deal of attention in the
policy-making process."57 Other weapons thought to receive significant
attention are submarines and main battle tanks.58 It's not clear,
though, why submarines, supersonic aircraft, and tanks are conceptually
distinct from other types of weapons. There is, however, a sense that
weapons can be used as political signals. Arms can be part of a
reciprocal agreement for some other good, or they can be a means of
gaining influence in the receiving state.59 As I show later, weapons are
long-term investments and providing (or denying) new technologies to a
state is a central process in the development of status hierarchies.
Unlike iPads, new fighter jet models are not released every year. The
transfer of high-tech weapons thus creates durable status hierarchies
between and within groups of states. Additionally, [arms can send
signals ranging from "gestures of political support," to friendship and
trust]{.underline}, to signals of technological modernity.60 In sum,
arms can do things, but there is no consensus about which arms or what
things. [There is]{.underline} also [a **startling** **lack of
attention** to the decision not to sell arms]{.underline}, even though
[**withholding arms** can be an act of **great** **political
import**]{.underline}. [Freedman is a rare exception, accurately
observing that, "though only limited political **benefits** can normally
be expected from agreeing to sell arms, since this is seen in
**commercial** terms, **refusing to sell** arms is a **major political
act**. It appears as a **calculated insult**, reflecting on the
**stability**, **trust**, and **credit-worthiness**, or technical
competence of the **would-be recipient**]{.underline}."61 However,
[other researchers have not pursued this line of thinking]{.underline},
perhaps because the usual databases focus on the arms transfers that
come to fruition. Since withholding arms means a transfer does not
appear in these databases, the act is usually ignored.62

#### Key signal of the nature of ties

CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS AND SYMBOLIC SIGNALING To understand the political
effects of weapons, scholars need a way to talk about similarities and
differences between and among types of weapons; [the content of ties
between states is just as important as the existence of
one]{.underline}. This section develops a theory to explain the effects
of weapons transfers on foreign policy by making two moves. First, I
unpack the umbrella category of conventional weapons along the
dimensions of prestige and military utility. This lets me discuss
differences between weapons and the different conditions under which
they will be transferred. Second, I explain the signals that weapons
transfers send, and connect these signals to distinct foreign policy
behaviors. Weapon Typology Weapons have dual functions: they most
obviously affect capabilities, enabling actors to wage war and deter
aggression. But there is also a symbolic dimension: states share
understandings of prestigious and non-prestigious weapons. I create a
typology of weapons by contrasting the prestige of weapons with the more
familiar dimension of military utility, which provides the first step
toward analyzing the political effects of weapons transfers. [This
typology draws on existing literature, as well as fieldwork]{.underline}
at two international weapons exhibitions, where I observed the
importance of prestige for the way different actors talked about, and
purchased, weapons. Dimension 1: Prestige Prestige captures the symbolic
dimension of weapons, the shared understanding that some weapons are
more than others. This dimension builds on insights from other
disciplines that have long recognized a difference between prestige and
"functional" goods. Functional goods accomplish basic necessary tasks,
whereas prestige goods are kept for use and displayed periodically to
indicate wealth, success, and power.63 This distinction between prestige
and functional goods needs to be modified to fit weapons transfers,
since high prestige weapons are not simply for display, periodically
dusted off for a military parade or two. Further, even relatively
useless weapons are qualitatively distinct goods because they have the
ability to harm, and are thus not directly comparable to regular gifts
given between individuals, such as a vase or a ring.64 Prestige weapons
are usually those with a high level of offensive striking power or
technological sophistication. These weapons do more than the basic
functional task of territorial defense, though I note that firepower or
technological sophistication is necessary, but not sufficient, as a
cause of prestige. One insight that does carry over concerns
reciprocity. On the level of the individual social relationship, giving
a gift incurs a mutual obligation from the receiver to the giver, and
the possession of prestige goods is a way to get others to recognize
your importance.65 At the level of interstate relations, there is still
an implied mutual obligation -- State A gives State B a weapon and
expects state B to behave "properly", however defined. Equally
important, [the transfer of prestige weapons is a statement about the
type of relationship the states have. Just as diamond rings are usually
exchanged between committed couples, prestigious weapons are usually
exchanged between similarly committed/aligned states]{.underline}.
Though nuclear weapons are recognized as prestigious weapons,66 prestige
is not the privilege solely of the nuclear realm: [there is]{.underline}
a hierarchy of [prestige in conventional weapons]{.underline}, too.
Existing literature considers three types of weapons prestigious --
supersonic aircraft, main battle tanks, and submarines.67 The criteria
this implies for assessing prestige is unclear, since the three weapons
are very different in use, firepower, and technological sophistication.
Though highly capable and technologically sophisticated, supersonic
aircraft are usually defensive weapons designed to quickly intercept an
opponent's aircraft. Submarines, on the other hand, enable stealthy
offense, have high capabilities and technology, and can be
nuclear-capable. Main battle tanks are considered a prestigious weapons
platform even though their offensive firepower is limited in both range
and caliber, and their level of technological sophistication is
significantly below that of fighter jets and submarines. By all of these
measures, main battle tanks are an outlier on the list of prestigious
weapons platforms. [Clearly, the correlation between prestige and
offensive power or technological sophistication is not
determinative]{.underline}. I propose that [perceptions play a large
role]{.underline} in determining what types of platforms are
prestigious, [and]{.underline} that [these perceptions usually cue on
superpower actions]{.underline}. Main battle tanks are considered
prestigious because of their association with the great power wars of
the twentieth century.68 Similarly, intercontinental ballistic missiles
are a prestigious platform because of their perceptual association with
nuclear weapons,69 even though there are many weapons within this
platform that are universally ineffective because they have poor
targeting capabilities and poor construction.70 [The opposite
relationship holds, too]{.underline}. Refueling planes stand out as
weapons that have extremely high levels of technology -- from the
sensors to detect how close it is to the plane taking on fuel, to the
in-air delivery system, to an engine able to give lift to a massive
plane, to all of the associated safety mechanisms -- and that require an
extraordinary level of skill to pilot, but these weapons are not
considered prestigious. Though there may be a minimum baseline of either
technological sophistication or offensive power necessary to be a
candidate for a prestige weapon, these factors are not determinative.
Rather, prestige is determined by perceptions.71 I observed the
importance of perceptions in creating prestige during fieldwork at two
international weapons shows. Many manufacturers tried to portray their
weapons as particularly important by unveiling them at a designated time
during the show, drawing significant crowds and creating an air of
excitement by pumping music through nearby speakers, or using security
ropes to allow only important visitors -- usually in military uniforms
or other official-looking attendees -- nearest to the weapon. During an
outdoor demonstration of a number of weapons, the "coolness" factor of
an armored vehicle was enhanced through a hard rock soundtrack. The
tempo of the music was used to manipulate the audience's perceptions of
the weapon on display, and varied based on how much perceptions of
different weapons needed to be manipulated.72 More mundane weapons, like
a firetruck and a fueling vehicle, were accompanied by explosions, to
get the audience to pay attention and to associate these weapons with
the battlefield, rather than support roles. Throughout the convention
halls, brochures touted specific capabilities or linked a particular
weapon to a known prestigious weapon. For example, Finnish arms company
Patria emphasized its integration of weapons systems in its Armored
Modular Vehicle as providing "the digital backbone for 21st century
soldiers," perhaps trying to portray this armored vehicle -- usually not
very technologically sophisticated -- as at the technological cutting
edge, and thus prestigious. The concept of prestige is not reducible to
the economic cost of the weapons transfer. First, states often give
weapons at free or significantly discounted rates to friends and allies.
Second, there is no agreed upon way to calculate cost. For example, the
AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon, produced by Raytheon, has an acquisition
cost of \$3.3 billion. But because the Navy and Air Force ordered 12,000
missiles the per-unit production cost is \$246,585.73 By contrast,
General Dynamic's M1A1 Abrams Tank has a per-unit cost of \$2.38
million.74 The Abrams tank, though a useful main battle tank, was first
produced in the 1970s, where as the JSOW is a brand-new missile.
Determining prestige based on cost would be misleading in this case.
Further, some transfer agreements include contracts for maintenance
and/or spare parts. This would increase the value of the transfer, but
would not indicate anything about prestige.75 Prestige is a heuristic
used by a variety of actors to make inferences about the future
relationship between the sending and receiving states. This heuristic
suggests that higher prestige weapons signify a greater relationship to
come; states woo one another with the prettiest, most attention-grabbing
weapons. Different types of weapons -- like gifts between two
individuals -- reflect the weight of the relationship, and change in
type and/or amount as the closeness between the states changes.76
[Weapons are certainly valuable for their military functions, but the
symbol of prestigious weapons is a way of distinguishing allies from
non-allies]{.underline},77 [can be an invitation to a closer
relationship,78 and is an expression of the sender's perception of the
receiver]{.underline}.79 Prestigious weapons are a visible signal of
commitment and interest, and states are therefore more circumspect in
transferring these weapons. Less prestigious weapons are more likely to
be transferred because they don't signal a deep commitment; [they are
one of the means states have for expressing]{.underline} potential
[interest]{.underline}. Low prestige doesn't mean that the weapon is
devoid of use: support weapons like transport aircraft or armored
personnel carriers are essential for both offensive and defensive
operations. But because every state that has a functioning military
needs to pay attention to the "tail" in the tooth-to-tail ratio, the
transfer of low prestige weapons is not nearly as noticeable and does
not constitute a political relationship in the same way as high prestige
weapons. [Treating prestige as a heuristic is in line with the cognitive
psychology literature that reminds us that individuals use heuristic
principles to reduce the complex task of assessing probability and
predicting outcomes, especially in situations of high
uncertainty]{.underline}.80 [Weapons prestige functions as a
representative and an availability heuristic: it is the cue by which
states reduce complex inputs about the future.81]{.underline} [In this
case, cognitive psychology applies as much to the state as to
individuals. States are composed of individuals]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} we know that [people reflect on their lifetime of
experiences in making associations between particular actions as part of
a larger class of actions.82]{.underline} [This process should be
compounded in states because of both institutional and national
memories: while an individual will rely on events from her lifetime,
states institutions and bureaucracies effectively increase the
"lifetime" of events on which individuals]{.underline} can [rely for
making these judgments. Further, the actors involved as the individual,
bureaucratic, and state-level decision-making process are especially
attentive to signaling and intentions, increasing the salience of this
heuristic]{.underline}. Prestige, then, is a perceptually determined
assessment of weapons, that draws on technology, firepower, and the
status of states that use the weapon. Dimension 2: Military Utility
Military utility captures the ways in which a weapon affects a state's
relative capabilities. My use of the concept draws inspiration from
Glaser and Kaufman's call to broaden the conceptualization of the
offense-defense balance.83 Military utility may incorporate appraisals
of versatility, efficacy, reliability, portability, or maintenance. For
example, there are a number of medium-range or intercontinental missiles
that -- because of targeting issues -- cannot hit the broad side of a
barn. Compared to similar types of missiles, these specific ones, such
as the Chinese-made DF-3 missile, popular in the 1980s, are rather
useless.84 Similarly, Lockheed Martin's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter may
initially be read as a capable weapons because of its technological
sophistication and advanced engineering: it is a stealthy plane with
vertical take-off and landing functions. But it has performance issues
that include impaired aerial combat capabilities, a limited payload, and
the tendency to decapitate pilots when making high-G turns. The F-35 is
designed to be a single node in high-tech networked warfare, but for
most states at most times it is not a militarily useful plane. I compare
weapons produced within the same time frame so that vastly different
levels of technology are not directly compared. Even if a weapon meets a
baseline level of military utility, different strategic environments,
skill level of militaries, or state infrastructure can reduce the
usefulness of certain weapons for certain states. Some weapons can be
more militarily useful for one country but not for another. An extreme
example of this is Singapore's recent obsession with Cold War-era German
tanks. As an island city-state, it is unclear how Singapore would make
use of the tanks, but it purchased nearly 200 Leopard Tanks and even
built an underground storage facility for them.85 Tanks don't make
strong military sense for Singapore. As discussed in greater detail at
the end of this chapter, military utility compares weapons produced in
the same time period and results in a relative measure of capabilities.
It parses out differences in use so that not all weapons are assumed to
have an equal effect on a state's ability to wield power. Contrasting
these two dimensions gives four types of weapons, shown in Table 2. Boom
weapons are prestigious and highly capable. Contemporary examples
include the F15 fighter jet, submarines (especially nuclear powered),
and the S-300 missile defense system.86 Bling in the world of armaments
are weapons that are significantly less effective than others of the
same type. Historical examples include the F-104 fighter jet -- a very
fast and literally shiny plane that was ineffective as a defensive
interceptor or mid-air fighter--- as well as the DF-3 missile, a
medium-range intercontinental ballistic missile that has significant
targeting issues that reduce its ability to be militarily effective.
Backbone weapons are low in prestige and capabilities, include weapons
like the KC-46 Pegasus tanker plane, mundane vehicles like Jeeps, and
transport and training aircraft. These weapons are often ignored in
analyses of the offense-defense balance, but backbone weapons are the
unsung heroes of the military: they are essential for enabling most
operations, but never get any of the credit. Finally, blip weapons are
those low in prestige and low in capabilities. This category includes
ammunition, firearms, and small bombs. Though all of these weapons do
have military use, they need to be used in large quantities, and usually
in conjunction with other weapons, in order to be useful; the scope of
their usefulness is much more limited compared to other weapons.
However, contexts of civil war or armed group movements can change the
salience of blip weapons, and they can become important intra-war
signaling devices. For example, in some contexts having new M-4 rounds
signals support from one individual/group to another, but AK-47 rounds
do not.87 While this typology is an important first step in breaking
apart the diverse category of conventional weapons, on its own it does
not provide any guidance about what weapons should be transferred
between different states, or what types of transfers send what type of
signal. For that, I shift to a relational lens, and explain how existing
relationships generate expectations of different types of weapons
transfers. Weapons Transfer Expectations and Signal Type Intuitively,
the quality of states' relationships should matter: closer states should
transfer different types of weapons than states that have less in common
or that do not share strategic goals. This is why, as explained in the
Introduction, Turkey's choice of China as a missile supplier caused such
outrage among its NATO allies. Similarly, the routine transfers among
NATO allies are less notable for their political signaling than they are
as evidence of standard operating procedure within the alliance,
building inter-operability, bolstering the capabilities of the alliance,
and reinforcing NATO as a political institution. The proposed transfer
from China to Turkey was unexpected, whereas transfers among NATO allies
are routine and expected. This relational dynamic has long been
recognized by policymakers. Take, for example, United States Military
Sales and Assistance Manuals, which all state: "The willingness of the
U.S. Government to sell military equipment varies country by country in
accordance with the military requirement, ability to maintain and use,
compatibility with existing inventory, and impact on the preconceptions
and the actions of the buyer\'s neighbors." 88 In other words, states do
not act in a dyadic vacuum: the relationship between the sender and the
receiver and the receiver's neighborhood affect which transfers are
expected or unexpected.89 For example, US transfers to Saudi Arabia are
not a dyadic process: US law prohibits the transfer of weapons that
would make any Middle Eastern state qualitatively superior to Israel.90
I generalize these relational patterns through the concept of strategic
interest, which captures the extent to which states' interests and
ideologies align or conflict. This concept allows me to differentiate
between weapons transfers that accord with existing ties and those that
are more surprising, which is an important interim step in determining
which transfers send different signals. Strategic interest is a concept
central to bargaining and deterrence theory, two bodies of literature
that have addressed ways to send signals,91 and encompasses both
instrumental reasons for alignment, such as common foe, natural resource
or economic dependence, as well as diffuse or ideational reasons like
shared worldview or cultural affinity.92 The degree of shared strategic
interest between states can often be determined by threat perceptions
and national security narratives, whether the states identify the same
foe(s) and the threat posed by them, or whether states have similar
ideas about how the world should work. Depending on the degree of shared
interests between states, different types of arms are expected (because
they confirm or cement existing relations) or unexpected (because they
constitute a new relationships). Expected arms reinforce ties between
the sender and receiver, and generally have a readily-apparent balance
of power logic to them: states transfer weapons to bolster the relative
capabilities of their friends, and refrain from bolstering capabilities
of their opponents or of their friends' opponents.93 Table 3, below,
summarizes the expected and unexpected transfers based on the degree of
shared strategic interest. The following sub-sections explain why
certain types of weapons are expected or unexpected in different
contexts, and connects the (un)expectedness of the transfer to different
signals. Expected transfers: Reinforcement Signals [Expected arms
transfers accord with and support the status quo; they send a
reinforcement signal. Oftentimes, these transfers become so routine and
ingrained in relationships that the reinforcement signal goes unnoticed;
it is part of standard operating procedure and only noticeable when
there is an interruption to the reinforcement signal]{.underline}. Most
types of weapons transfers are expected when states have substantial
common interests. Prestigious and capable boom weapon transfers are
expected for reasons of interoperability-- facilitating joint operations
-- and because of bureaucratic standard operating procedure.94 Again,
it's not surprising that the NATO allies have remarkably similar
arsenals, nor that these states engage in cooperative development of
advanced weapons in order to reduce costs and share knowledge.95 Boom
weapons transferred between states that share close ties reinforce and
maintain these ties. Bling weapons -- those that are highly prestigious
but less militarily useful -- are useful for reinforcing ties among
states that share interests as well. Backbone weapons are expected
transfers when states have substantial common interests, or when they
have a mix of interests. When states have similar goals and policies,
these weapons are desired for their military use. The workhorses of
modern militaries, backbone weapons are essential for moving troops and
materiel. When states have a mix of interests, these weapons are
desirable because of their low prestige. The arms are useful, but don't
signal a deep political relationship, so the sender can transfer the
weapons without fear of emboldening the receiver, and the receiver can
accept the weapons without fear that it is signaling alignment with the
sender. Blip weapons are also expected when states have a mix of
interests. Though all of these weapons do have military use, they can be
transferred without any signaling consequences because of their low
prestige. Unexpected Transfers: Upgrade and Downgrade Signals [Transfers
can be unexpected in]{.underline} either [a]{.underline} positive or
[negative way, which correspond]{.underline}, respectively,
[with]{.underline} upgrade and [downgrade signals. An absence of
transfers between states that have substantial common interests is
unexpected. To rely on the familiar example of the NATO allies, it would
be very surprising if a NATO ally was denied the transfer of a weapon
other allies possessed, or if a NATO ally decided to seek weapons from
outside the alliance.]{.underline} [The lack of transfer sends a
downgrade signal: it is a visible interruption to the shared ties
between the state]{.underline}s.96 \[Footnote 96\] 96 [Some might argue
that the lack of a transfer in this condition is epiphenomenal to a
larger strategic interest shift]{.underline} (e.g., the US pivot to Asia
might lead to fewer transfers to Europe). [While]{.underline} it is
plausible that [the lack of a transfer might signal a downgrading of the
states' relationship, this should be a very rare case. States, even if
undertaking a strategic shift, will still want their friends and allies
to have advanced weaponry]{.underline}. [Being seen to draw away from or
downgrade the relationship with states with whom you share significant
strategic interests could undermine the sender's reputation as a
reliable ally.]{.underline} \[End Footnote\] [Downgrade
signals]{.underline} can also [come if the transfer is a mismatch with
the receiver's expectations. This can be caused by receiving a lower
quantity or lower type of weapon,]{.underline} [such as expecting
fighter jets but receiving cargo planes. Mismatched transfers indicate a
growing rift between the sender and receiver]{.underline}. [Jordan, for
example, expected to receive the]{.underline} F-104
[Starfighter]{.underline} [jet]{.underline}, a bling weapon, from the
United States [in 1967. It was instead sent a small number
of]{.underline} backbone and blip weapons, including [rifles and utility
trucks, leading King Hussein to reconsider what he thought was a close
US-Jordanian relationship. Importantly, a downgrade signal can be
initiated by the sender or the receiver]{.underline} of a weapon. [The
sender can choose to prevent the receiver from acquiring a weapon, or
the receiver can rebuff offers. The downgrade signal is sent regardless.
For example, in March 2015, Sweden decided not to negotiate a new
defense agreement with Saudi Arabia, a move that signaled new tensions
and disputes between the two states.97]{.underline}

After Jan. 20, President Donald [Trump will juggle a number of important
tensions with longstanding U.S. allies]{.underline}. For example,
[Trump's tweets suggest rapprochement with Russia]{.underline} is a
priority, [yet NATO allies]{.underline} and the U.S. Congress [will
press for support]{.underline} to NATO allies, [such as those in the
Baltic region]{.underline}. [In Asia, Trump has promised to take a
strong line against Chinese assertiveness, but]{.underline} [has also
questioned whether Japan and South Korea are contributing enough to
contain China. So Trump faces this dilemma: how can he reassure allies
while engaging adversaries? Our **research** suggests]{.underline} one
possibility: **[arms transfers]{.underline}**. In our recent
International Security article, we elaborate on the "patron's dilemma"
that arises when relationships with allies change. We explain [the
**decades-old** U.S. playbook]{.underline}, which [calls for the United
States to signal **reassurance** and **deterrence** via **arms
transfers**]{.underline}, [while improving ties with
adversaries]{.underline}. Will Trump follow this playbook? [Arms
transfers are **particularly** useful when **geostrategic priorities**
are **shifting**]{.underline}. Here's why we think Trump will use this
foreign policy tool: [Arms transfers accomplish two important goals:
upgrading local deterrent capabilities and **offsetting**]{.underline}
**[fears of abandonment]{.underline}**. [Allies are better equipped to
defend themselves]{.underline}, thanks to U.S. weapons. Arms transfers
typically don't attract as much attention as U.S. military deployments
or new treaty commitments. But they can enable the recipient to engage
in aggressive foreign policies that the United States might not desire,
especially if the arms transfers enable offensive operations. Experts
call this worry "entrapment" --- when an ally gets drawn into another
country's conflict. Arms transfers signal a different form of commitment
than alliances. After all, treaty alliances tie hands by requiring
allies to fight for one another in any future conflict. Such treaties
are formalized security ties --- and usually follow a politicized
ratification process. These "pieces of paper" are inflexible, but do not
necessarily require follow-up military investment. What sorts of arms
transfers are most likely? Two factors shape what combination of
alliances and arms the United States might offer its clients. First,
U.S. foreign policymakers look at shared security interests when
deciding whether to form or maintain an alliance. To make this
determination, U.S. policymakers typically ask whether the client state
has a similar or different ranking of security threats than that of the
United States. Here's an example. Both Western Europe and the United
States shared the view that the Soviet Union was the leading threat to
their vital interests after World War II, so they formed NATO. If the
threat rankings align, Washington seeks to establish or strengthen an
alliance. If the threat rankings differ, then U.S. foreign policymakers
find that avoiding or downgrading an alliance commitment better serves
U.S. interests. Indeed, that is why the Carter administration scrapped
the U.S. formal alliance with Taiwan to normalize ties with China in
1978. Second, U.S. leaders decide whether to arm the client. In making
this decision, policymakers ask whether the client can deter its
adversary without U.S. assistance. If the local security balance favors
an adversary, then transfers of U.S. weapons may be necessary to bolster
the client's security. If the local security balance favors the ally,
substantial arms transfers are unnecessary --- and can even encourage
entrapment by the client. Here's what this will mean in practice ---
more arms transfers So [how might the next administration approach the
geopolitical conundrums associated with adjusting U.S.
alliances?]{.underline} If U.S. leaders seek rapprochement with Russia,
is there a quid pro quo? A close aide of Vladimir [Putin
has]{.underline} already [suggested that pulling back NATO
forces]{.underline} from the Baltic region [would reassure Moscow that
Washington seeks closer ties. Yet if Trump obliges, then he might be
under pressure]{.underline} from Congress and from NATO allies [to
reassure Baltic countries that the United States will minimize the risks
of Russia exploiting any great power bargain. To solidify the U.S.
long-term commitment, Washington might offer lethal defensive
weapons]{.underline} to boost Baltic ground and air defenses. [This move
would]{.underline} then [enhance local deterrence]{.underline}. Russia
might have no other choice than to accept this compromise if its desire
for rapprochement is sincere. [For a precedent, look no further than the
recent Iran deal. Since the]{.underline} July [2015 Iran nuclear deal,
Saudi Arabia has received large amounts of U.S. weapons, including an
arms agreement worth \$1 billion, to attenuate its security
concerns]{.underline}. [This scenario played out often after the
normalization of relations with China.]{.underline} [Washington agreed
to recognize Beijing]{.underline} as the official government of China.
[Yet]{.underline} Washington often [made major arms transfers like
fighter jets and surface-to-air missile systems to Taiwan to reassure
Taipei that the United States remained committed to Taiwan's ability to
defend itself]{.underline} against mainland China. Following Obama's
footsteps? Unlike his stance on Russia, [Trump appears to favor a more
hawkish approach toward China]{.underline}, as evidence by his comments
on the one-China policy. [Yet Trump's comments about burden-sharing by
Japan and South Korea create a tension because balancing against China
would require strengthening --- not weakening --- alliances with Japan
and South Korea. History suggests that more arms sales to Taiwan are

**[Slotnick 15]{.underline}**

Lorne Slotnick, Chair of the Arbitration Board, Labour Arbitration
Awards has issued the following decision: IN THE MATTER OF AN
ARBITRATION BETWEEN: St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton -and- Canadian
Union of Public Employees Local 786, Labour Arbitration Awards: St.
Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton v Canadian Union of Public Employees, Local
786, 2015 CanLII 18978 (ON LA), 2015

The union points to the definition of "similar" in the online Oxford
English Dictionary as "having a marked resemblance or likeness; of a
like nature or kind," and in Black's Law Dictionary as "nearly
corresponding; resembling in many respects; somewhat like; having a
general likeness, although allowing for some degree of difference." In
addition, "[**substantially**" is defined in the **O**xford **E**nglish
**D**ictionary as]{.underline} ["in **all** essential characters or
features]{.underline}; [in essentials, **to all intents and purposes**,
**in the main**," and in]{.underline} **[Black's \[Law]{.underline}**
Dictionary\] [as "**essentially**; **without material
qualification**]{.underline}; **[in the main]{.underline}**; in
substance; **[materially]{.underline}**; in a substantial manner." The
fact that the collective agreement uses both words together must mean
that the two shift rotations have to be essentially corresponding or
resembling each other in all essential respects for the conditions to be
met, the union argues.

[\"Should\" is \"used . . . to]{.underline} express duty,
[obligation,]{.underline} propriety, or expediency.\" Webster\'s Third
New International Dictionary 2104 (2002). Courts \[\*\*15\] interpreting
the word in various contexts have drawn conflicting conclusions,
although [the weight of authority appears to favor interpreting
\"should\" in an imperative, obligatory sense]{.underline}. HN7A number
of courts, confronted with the question of whether using the word
\"should\" in jury instructions conforms with the Fifth and Sixth
Amendment protections governing the reasonable doubt standard, have
upheld instructions using the word. In the courts of other states in
which a defendant has argued that the word \"should\" in the reasonable
doubt instruction does not sufficiently inform the jury that it is bound
to find the defendant not guilty if insufficient proof is submitted at
trial, the courts have squarely rejected the argument. They reasoned
that [the word \"conveys a sense of duty and obligation and could not be
misunderstood]{.underline} by a jury.\" See State v. McCloud, 257 Kan.
1, 891 P.2d 324, 335 (Kan. 1995); see also Tyson v. State, 217 Ga. App.
428, 457 S.E.2d 690, 691-92 (Ga. Ct. App. 1995) (finding argument that
\"should\" is directional but not instructional to be without merit);
Commonwealth v. Hammond, 350 Pa. Super. 477, 504 A.2d 940, 941-42 (Pa.

\"should**]{.underline}\" in other types of jury instructions \[\*\*16\]
have also [found that the word conveys]{.underline} to the jury a sense
of duty or [**obligation** **and not discretion**]{.underline}. In
Little v. State, 261 Ark. 859, 554 S.W.2d 312, 324 (Ark. 1977), [the
Arkansas Supreme Court interpreted the word \"should]{.underline}\" in
an instruction on circumstantial evidence **[as synonymous
with]{.underline}** the word **[\"must]{.underline}**\" and rejected the
defendant\'s argument that the jury may have been misled by the court\'s
use of the word in the instruction. Similarly, the Missouri Supreme
Court rejected a defendant\'s argument that the court erred by not using
the word \"should\" in an instruction on witness credibility which used
the word \"must\" because the two words have the same meaning. State v.
Rack, 318 S.W.2d 211, 215 (Mo. 1958). \[\*318\] In applying a child
support statute, [the Arizona Court of Appeals concluded that a

**[Cranston]{.underline}**, Senator from California,
7/2/**[1974]{.underline}**

(Alan, testimony in the other chamber, *Congressional Record* -- House,
volume 120, pg. 22059)

All told the Center for Defense Information reports that the United
States spends about \$20 billion a year to prepare for the possibility
of war [in Asia and the Pacific]{.underline}, This figure includes the
cost of troops based in the U.S. but earmarked for an Asian conflict.
About 29 percent of our active-duty manpower, or 650,000 men, are geared
toward Аsіа.

[I favor a]{.underline} general [**reduction** in]{.underline} this
**[presence]{.underline}**, and I think the place to begin is with those
151,000 land-based troops. As long as we maintain our naval forces and
our troops in U.S. territories and possessions, we will have a
forward-based, highly mobile force poised for any contingency. Sooner or
later we may want to consider withdrawing these forces, too. But for the
time being, we should simply concentrate on forces based in foreign
countries. I by no means favor a precipitous withdrawal from the entire
area.

[Let me now turn to the countries where cuts are in order]{.underline}.

[KOREA]{.underline}

This fiscal year, we are spending \$610 million to maintain troops in
Korea.

As of March 31, 1974, the United States had 38,000 military personnel in
South Korea at over 40 military facilities. Over 30,000 are Army
personnel; the rest are Air Force.

It is hardly a \"lean, tough fighting force.\" Our Korea contingent
includes no less than 18 generals and admirals. No less than 1,113 men
staff the Eighth Army headquarters, including 12 generals. Whereas
normally a field army headquarters controls four divisions, this one
controls only one. And in that division, numbering 13,000 men, only
7,000 are in combat-related duties. Overall, the Senate Armed Services
Committee reports that the U.S. Army in Korea has a combat support ratio
of 37 to 63. of that 63 percent non-combat force, roughly a quarter is
in headquarters and administration.

Here is what a constituent of mine, a Sergeant First Class now stationed
in Korea. had to sav\--

"Each day I have cringed at the waste of manpower and resources with our
military forces being stationed here. Daily, I watch servicemen bilked
out of their hard earned money, the prostitutes peddling their wares in
droves, the rampant drug problems, and the thriving black market, I see
the millions of dollars flow into the hands of local vendors, the
hundreds of local national civilians employed supporting the military
while Americans at home go unemployed, and the waste of money supporting
a shaky dictatorship.

\"Ask any soldier, \"Why are you here?\". Few, if any, can find a
plausible answer. Why? Because there isn\'t one.

\"Let\'s bring the troops home. Hire American civilians to support the
military units. Spend our money at home, and on our own people, we can
still maintain our military posture. I am tired of seeing the U.S.
dollars becoming more and more valueless.

\"The Korean War ended almost 20 years ago. Isn\'t it about time we came
home?\"

According to the International Institute for Strategic studies, south
Korea\'s army contains 560,000 men to North Korea\'s 408,000. South
Korean army reserves total 1,000,000 to North Korea\'s 750,000. South
Korea\'s population is more than double the North\'s. Finally, South
Korea has a para-military force, including a local defense militia, of
about two millions, whereas the North Korean counterpart numbers about a
million and a half.

Defense Department spokesmen hawe testitled before the Senate Armed
Services Committee that in the unlikely event of a renewed war between
North and South, the South Koreans could handle the ground fighting by
themselves. The only category in which the South Koreans are said to be
weaker than the North Koreans is modern fighter aircraft. But under the
terms of a sl.5 billion. 5year military agreement to modernize Korea\'s
armed forces, the United states will prowide a sufficient number of P5E
fighter planes to offset this disadvantage.

There is nothing in our defense treaty with Korea that requires u-to
station troops there. And we can\'t kid ourselves about Korean democracy
anymore, not since 1972 when President Park dissolved the Assembly,
declared martial law, and assumed dictatorial powers.

[JAPAN AND OKINAWA]{.underline}

The U.S. will spend \$4.47 million this fiscal year to maintain 57,000
U.S. military personnel in Japan and Okinawa, including an entire Marine
division. The U.S. has 85 bases and military installations in Japan
proper, not counting okinawa. These include six airfields, two naval
bases, two bombing ranges, and six ammunition depots. In a country where
103 million people live in an area slightly smaller than the state of
California, and where roughly 80 percent of the land cannot be inhabited
or cultivated, American bases take up roughly one percent of the total
area. Roughly 70 percent of the U.S. bases, and 77 percent of the
American personnel were located within 60 miles of Tokyo, especially in
the densely populated Kanto plain. American bases are also associated
with drugs, a fact that greatly worries local authorities.

Meanwhile, Japan has built up her own military forces. Her so-called
\"Self-Defense Forces\" number a quarter of a million men. Her arsenal
already contains T-2 supersonic trainers, C-1 jet transports,
diesel-powered submarines, helicopter-carrying destroyers, and
anti-submarine aircraft. Her army includes \-\-\-\--, her navy 40
destroyers and 13 submarines, and her air force 490 fighters. Her fourth
FiveYear Defense Plan, launched in October 1972, entails an outlay
totalling 815 billion.

Many Japanese officials have said privately that both the United States
and Japan would be better off if the U.S. withdrew at least half of its
troops.

Such a withdrawal would not force Japan to become a nuclear power, as it
is sometimes alleged. Japan\'s ruling party is largely opposed to the
acquisition of nuclear arms and is not seriously expected to change its
mind. whether or not the U.S. cuts a substantial number or troops.

Japan is an important and loyal ally whose interests are closely bound
up with ours. It boasts the third largest GNP in the world. Since 1946,
the United States has given or lent Japan almost \$4 billion in military
and economic aid. This investment has yielded a strong and increasingly
self-confident ally,

THAILAND

as of March 31, there were 35,000 U.S. milltary personnel in Thailand at
an operating cost of 344.7 million in this fiscal year. Our presence
there consists overwhelmingly of Air Force pilots and support personnel
poised to resume the bombing of North Vietnam.

The Administration has already announced a cut of 8,000 men by August. A
larger bulk of U.S. forces should be withdrawn, including any military
personnel involved in domestic counterinsurgency programs in Thailand.
There is no present need to keep any bombers in thalland. congress has
specificaliy prohibited the renewed bombing of Indochina without
congressional authorization.

THE PHILIPPINES

As of March 31, there were 17,000 U.S. military personnel in the
Philippines---an increase of 2000 within the last year. The U.S. Naval
Base at Subic Bay is the largest naval base in a foreign country in the
Pacific.

In September 1972, President Marcos instituted martial law and assumed
the posts of president and prime minister for as long as he chooses. A
Moslem insurrection has been raging in the southern islands for some
time.

Our troop presence in the Philippines is not based on any fear that the
Philippines will be attacked. Pentagon spokesmen have repeatedly stated
that Chinese aggression in the area is highly unlikely. Instead, there
are charges that our troop strength is helping to shore up a dictatorial
government and to put down a domestic insurgency. A major cut is in
order there.

[TAIWAN]{.underline}

On March 31, our troop strength in Taiwan numbered 5,000 men. I
understand that some 2,000 of these will be withdrawn soon.

In the so-called Shanghal Communique of February 1972, the United States
affirmed that an ultimate goal was the withdrawal of all U.S. forces and
military installations from Taiwan. In the meantime, [the U.S. pledged
that it would]{.underline} \"[progressively reduce its
forces]{.underline} and military installations [on Taiwan]{.underline}
as the tension in the area dimin1shes.\" That tension was understood to
be Vietnam.

[To my great regret]{.underline}, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is still heavily subsidizing President
Thieu\'s]{.underline} war-minded [regime]{.underline}. But now that our
troops have come home, [we should carry out our pledge]{.underline}.

DEACTIVATION

I favor deactivation of the troops we bring home.

For a cut of 100,000 men, annual savings amount to some 81.2 billion.
Indirect savings in troop support, military construction, maintenance,
logistics, and other back-up functions could amount to as much as \$5
billion more.

In addition, the balance of payments saving associated with -1ch-cutback
would be roughly \$800 million a year. Our present overseas posture
undermines the dollar by maintaining military dependents abroad,
employing thousands of foreign civilians, and enabling military men and
their families to spend millions of dollars in foreign countries on
foreign goods and services,

Deactivation of 100,000 men will help free money that could be far
better spent on domestic needs---or simply left unspent, which, I
suppose, is a new but perhaps a refreshing idea.

U.S. COMMITMENTS AND U.S. TROOPS

[Opponents of troop cut amendments try to portray the physical
**presence** of each]{.underline} and every [U.S. soldier **overseas**
as]{.underline} sacred and [inviolable]{.underline}. [Each one is seen
as a mini-bargaining chip in the grand global scheme of
things]{.underline}.

[But what good is a]{.underline} **[\"bargaining chip\"]{.underline}**
whose total cost is roughly \$30 billion a year[?]{.underline} [In
Asia]{.underline}, [with whom are we bargaining]{.underline}, [and for
what stakes?]{.underline} It appears that [the]{.underline}
**[\"bargaining chip\"]{.underline}** [argument is **locking us into**
an obsolete]{.underline} and expensive [**posture** **instead of**
opening up]{.underline} corridors of flexible **[change]{.underline}**.

#### Bargaining requires [maintaining]{.underline} presence -- Soviet reductions prove -- voting aff was a reversal and ended the counterplan policy

**[Hyde-Price]{.underline}**, professor of political science at the
University of Gothenberg, **[1996]{.underline}**

(Adrian, The International Politics of East Central Europe, p. 232)

It was only [in the case of Poland]{.underline} that [no]{.underline}
early [agreement was reached on]{.underline} a [Soviet military
withdrawal]{.underline}. There were a number of reasons for this. For
the Soviets, a military presence in Poland was useful in order to
protect their lines of communication with Soviet forces in Germany; the
Soviet military was also in no hurry to withdraw from its barracks in
Poland, because of a dearth of housing for Soviet military personnel in
the USSR. On the Polish side, the government\'s failure to secure an
early agreement reflected its ambivalent attitude to the Soviet military
presence: [for much of 1990]{.underline}, it seemed as if [Warsaw was
interested in **maintaining**]{.underline} a [Soviet military
presence]{.underline} in Poland as a counterweight to German influence,
and [as a]{.underline} possible [**bargaining chip** in their
negotiations with Bonn on a new bilateral treaty]{.underline}." [By the
time the Polish government had decided that they would prefer the Soviet
military to leave]{.underline} (in the autumn of 1990), a conservative
retrenchment was gathering momentum in Moscow, and [the Poles\'
interlocutors were in no mood to make concessions]{.underline}. [It was
only after the failure of the abortive coup in Moscow in]{.underline}
August 19[**91** that]{.underline} an agreement on the
[withdrawal]{.underline} of Soviet forces [was finalised]{.underline}."
In October 1991, an 'agreement in principle\" on the withdrawal of the
59,000 Soviet forces was concluded (5,000 of them were withdrawn during
the negotiations). By late October 1992, all Russian combat troops had
been withdrawn from Poland. Some 6,000 support troops remained to
facilitate the withdrawal of Russian troops from Germany, but they
finally left in September 1993.

### \--theory

#### Any uncertainty and you err Neg---They're using the perm to avoid debate on *[the core issue]{.underline}* of [US-China policy]{.underline}: Is [unilateral drawdown]{.underline} a good idea, or ought we instead engage in [reciprocal accommodation]{.underline} strategies?

**[Goldstein]{.underline}**, associate professor and founding director,
China Maritime Studies Institute, U.S. Naval War College, May
**[2015]{.underline}**

(Lyle, *Meeting China Halfway*, pg. 344)

Washington's move 1 in the larger strategic relationship: The United
States should initiate a "bottom-up review" of Taiwan policy with a
stated goal of increasing flexibility (figure 12.1). [Taiwan has long
been at the **very center** of US-China tensions]{.underline}, for
historical, ideological, and strategic reasons, as discussed at length
in chapter 2 and particularly chapter 3 of this book. In deference to
the issue's extreme importance for improving US-China relations, chapter
3 reveals this book's first cooperation spiral that seeks to take
advantage of the post-2008 rapprochement in cross-Strait relations to
achieve major gains in US-China relations. [The cooperation
spiral]{.underline} advocated in chapter 3 [suggests]{.underline} a
process like all the others in the book of **[reciprocal
accommodation]{.underline}**, [featuring **major concessions on the
Chinese side**]{.underline}, including but not limited to pulling
missile forces back from the Taiwan Strait area, restricting amphibious
capabilities, and eventually even renouncing the use of force against
Taiwan. Relative gains (see chapter 1), however, will generally favor
China with regard to this issue, so that Washington would naturally
favor some kind of geopolitical compensation for its flexibility
regarding a central "core interest" of Beijing. [Many Western experts
will be skeptical about such an approach]{.underline}. For example, the
scholar Tom [Christensen has written]{.underline} recently
[that]{.underline} "[there is a basic intellectual problem with the view
that US-China cooperation is built on a horse trade]{.underline} of
sorts." 37 Presenting the framework elaborated in these pages, that
particular viewpoint clearly is not shared here. **["Horse
trading,"]{.underline}** it turns out, [is a central element of
effective diplomacy]{.underline}. In fact, [the pervasiveness of
Christensen's]{.underline} reluctant [view may]{.underline} partially
[explain the]{.underline} many [logjams that persist in US diplomacy and
that **afflict US-China relations**]{.underline} in particular. In
choosing to take a more flexible approach to Taiwan that overtly favors
peace and integration, the United States will indeed be pursuing its own
national security interests following the sound logic of scholars, such
as Glaser, Gilley, and Saunders (see chapter 3). But Taiwan is such a
fine "horse" that [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should
be rewarded for adopting a newly constructive position]{.underline} on
the issue; [and such a strategic]{.underline} "[exchange" of
benefits]{.underline}, especially with respect to "core interests,"
[will indeed be of great importance to those seeking to reform
Washington's longtime]{.underline} Taiwan [policies]{.underline}.

judge will or would do at a later stage - or (2) constitutes an in in

New International Dictionary 2104 (2002). Courts \[\*\*15\] interpreting
the word in various contexts have drawn conflicting conclusions,
although [the weight of authority appears to favor interpreting
\"should\" in an imperative, obligatory sense]{.underline}. HN7A number
of courts, confronted with the question of whether using the word
\"should\" in jury instructions conforms with the Fifth and Sixth
Amendment protections governing the reasonable doubt standard, have
upheld instructions using the word. In the courts of other states in
which a defendant has argued that the word \"should\" in the reasonable
doubt instruction does not sufficiently inform the jury that it is bound
to find the defendant not guilty if insufficient proof is submitted at
trial, the courts have squarely rejected the argument. They reasoned
that [the word \"conveys a sense of duty and obligation and could not be
misunderstood]{.underline} by a jury.\" See State v. McCloud, 257 Kan.

defendant\'s argument that the jury may have been misled by the court\'s
use of the word in the instruction. Similarly, the Missouri Supreme
Court rejected a defendant\'s argument that the court erred by not using
the word \"should\" in an instruction on witness credibility which used

## Taiwan QPQ

### 1NC Taiwan QPQ

#### The United States federal government should establish and clearly communicate a policy of maintaining its Direct Commercial Sales and Foreign Military Sales of arms to Taiwan only until China reaches a mutually agreeable settlement to its maritime disputes in the South and East China Seas and significantly reduces its military assets currently threatening Taiwan.

#### Unilateral reduction empowers hardliners and spurs Chinese aggression -- BUT leveraging US commitments as a BARGAINING CHIP would be a key test of China's motives. Either they'll RESOLVE maritime disputes and reduce aggression, OR it reveals that China's fundamentally revisionist and the plan is a bad idea

Charles L. **[Glaser 15]{.underline}** - Charles L. Glaser is professor
of political science and international affairs and director of the
Elliott School\'s Institute for Security and Conflict Studies. His
research focuses on international relations theory and international
security policy. "A U.S.-China Grand Bargain? The Hard Choice between
Military Competition and Accommodation" International Security, Vol. 39,
No. 4 (Spring 2015), pp. 49-90.
<https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/isec_a_00199.pdf>. NL

The preceding assessment lays bare the complexity of a U.S. policy of
territorial accommodation. On the one hand, ending the U.S. commitment
to Taiwan could greatly reduce and might even eliminate the possibility
of a large war between the United States and China by keeping the United
States out of a China-Taiwan conºict. In addition, accommodation could
improve China's understanding of U.S. goals and its image of the United
States, and moderate military competition in Northeast Asia, thereby
setting U.S.-China relations on a promising trajectory that takes
advantage of the relatively benign structural environment in which
China's rise will occur. On the other hand, [accommodation would be
costly---running contrary to U.S. political and ideological
interests---and risky, possibly reducing U.S. security by fueling
Chinese underestimates of U.S. resolve and by encouraging China to adopt
more extensive geopolitical aims]{.underline}. The United States' choice
of whether to end its commitment to defend Taiwan is complicated further
by uncertainty about the nature and extent of China's goals. If China
places relatively little value on expanding its control and inºuence
beyond Taiwan, then even if U.S. accommodation generated doubts about
U.S. resolve, they would be of little consequence. In contrast, [if
China highly values winning all of its maritime disputes and pushing the
United States out of Northeast Asia, then reductions in U.S. credibility
would be more costly.]{.underline} Similarly, if China's aims are both
limited and stable, then U.S. accommodation would not risk creating a
more dangerous China. In contrast, if China's goals are still evolving
and [if U.S. accommodation would empower domestic hard-liners, then U.S.
security would be reduced]{.underline}. Therefore, the question arises
whether policies exist that would reduce the risks while preserving the
beneªts of U.S. accommodation on Taiwan. [If combining certain
concessions by China in an overall package---a grand bargain, for lack
of a better term---could achieve this goal, then the United States' best
option might be to make ending its commitment to Taiwan contingent on
China making concessions of its own]{.underline}. The preceding analysis
suggests that the United States should design such a grand bargain with
a variety of purposes in mind: to gain information about the nature and
extent of China's motives; to demonstrate its resolve to retain U.S.
security commitments in the region; and, related, to preserve the
credibility of its commitments to its allies. Likely the most common way
to envision a grand bargain is as an agreement in which two actors make
concessions across multiple issue to create a fair deal---that is, one
in which both beneªt equally---that would have been impossible in an
agreement that dealt with a single issue. A different way to envision a
grand bargain is as an agreement in which the states trade across
multiple issues, making both states better off, but not necessarily
equally. A grand bargain in Northeast Asia is likely to take the latter
form, partly because the agreement would be in response to a power shift
that favors China and partly because China's interests in the region are
greater than those of the United States. [The first component of a grand
bargain, and probably the most important, would be for China to resolve
its maritime disputes on "fair" terms]{.underline}.100 Oddly, there
seems to be both a little and a lot at stake in these disputes. Gaining
sovereignty over the offshore islands would strengthen China's claims to
the oil and gas reserves, which have increased the importance of the
disputes. At the same time, however, [the disputes have severely
hindered the exploration and extraction of]{.underline} these
[resources, and joint extraction and sharing agreements could provide
all parties with substantial resource benefits]{.underline}. Growing
nationalism has given the disputed territorial claims importance far
beyond their material and strategic value, and it has damaged the
prospects for any type of agreement. A U.S.-China Grand Bargain? 79 100.
[The United States is not directly involved in these disputes, but it
could encourage or pressure its allies to make compromises. An ideal
solution would be for China and its neighbors to place the territories
under some sort of international control as a maritime preserve and to
share the resources.101 Other solutions include joint governance over
the use of the islands/islets, agreement not to object to other states'
sovereignty claims, and agreement to end unilateral military patrols
near the disputed territories]{.underline}.102 [China's willingness to
reach an agreement on the offshore islands and related maritime disputes
would provide the United States with valuable information. Most
obviously, it would demonstrate that China's aims are
limited]{.underline} (at least for now). Closely related, [it would
demonstrate a degree of reasonableness in Chinese foreign policy
priorities]{.underline} and decisionmaking: given that the value of
Taiwan dwarfs the value of these maritime disputes, Chinese
unwillingness to reach this type of bargain would indicate deep
inºexibility in its emerging foreign policy and possibly overconªdence
in its ability to use its growing power to achieve all of its aims.
China's claims in these disputes are also weaker than its claims to
Taiwan: for example, China did not claim the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands
until 1970, which suggests that it should be able to moderate this claim
if the beneªts were sufªciently large. In addition, an agreement would
provide the United States with insights into the balance of power within
China's foreign policy decisionmaking. If China's more assertive
policies have reºected the growing inºuence of the People's Liberation
Army, narrow nationalist pressures, or both, then Chinese concessions
would demonstrate that the country's leaders could control these forces
when the stakes are sufªciently large. [Taken as a whole, this
information about China's goals would make U.S. accommodation over
Taiwan less risky. Insisting on Chinese concessions would also
demonstrate U.S. resolve to protect American interests. By making its
willingness to end its commitment to Taiwan contingent on Chinese
concessions, the United States would make clear that it is willing to
run the risk of protecting Taiwan and its allies' interests in the South
China and East China Seas, if China were uncompromising]{.underline}.
Once again, the key issue from the U.S. perspective comes back to
information---if China is more likely to have unlimited aims, then the
risks of U.S. accommodation are larger and the United States should
therefore be less willing to adopt this strategy. As argued above,
China's refusal to accept a grand bargain, especially one that is so
clearly weighted toward its interests (unless China is determined to
push the United States out of Northeast Asia), would indicate more
ambitious Chinese aims. Thus, [compared to unilateral concessions,
insisting on a package deal that included Chinese concessions would
demonstrate a higher level of U.S. resolve. In addition, resolution of
the maritime disputes would directly increase U.S. security by
eliminating disputes that, via alliance commitments, could draw the
United States into dangerous crises with China]{.underline}. [A second
component of a grand bargain would be official Chinese acceptance of the
United States' long-term security role in East Asia, including its
alliances and forward-deployed forces]{.underline}. There have been
periods when China viewed the U.S.-Japan alliance relatively favorable.
For example, in 1980 China's leader, Hua Guofeng, stated: "We appreciate
Japan's efforts to strengthen its alliance with the United States."103
Since then a variety of factors, including the decline of Soviet power
and the redeªnition of the U.S.-Japan alliance starting in the mid-1990s
have reduced, if not eliminated, China's positive assessment.104 In
recent years, some Chinese elites have begun expressing harshly negative
views. For example, in 2014 the deputy chief of the general staff of the
People's Liberation Army described the U.S. alliance system as "an
antiquated relic of the Cold War that should be replaced by an
Asia-centric security architecture."105 Although open to varying
interpretations, President Xi Jinping's call for an Asian security order
managed by Asian countries and his criticism of "alliances as unhelpful
for the region's security" can be viewed as offering a vision of the
future in which the United States no longer plays a security role in
East Asia. Increasingly, there is support in China for the conclusion
that "in Beijing's eyes, the U.S. led security architecture is outliving
the usefulness it once provided by ensuring the regional stability
necessary for China's development. Instead, China views the alliance
system as increasingly incapable of providing lasting security and
itself a potential source of threat."106 Especially in light of
Beijing's increasingly negative assessment, ofªcial recA U.S.-China
Grand Bargain? 81 103. Quoted in Jianwei Wang and Xinbo Wu, "Against Us
or with Us? The Chinese Perspective of America's Alliances with Japan
and Korea" (Stanford, Calif.: Asia/Paciªc Research Center, Stanford
University, May 1998), p. 20. Wang and Wu note that this statement and a
similar one the same year were the "nearest a Chinese leader had ever
come to publicly endorsing the U.S.-Japan alliance." 104. Wang and Wu,
"Against Us or with Us?"; and Xinbo Wu, "The End of the Silver Lining: A

thediplomat.com/2014/06/china-and-the-u-s-alliance-system. ognition and
acceptance of the United States' continuing alliance commitments would
be a valuable signal (not cheap talk). It would indicate the dominance
of certain domestic forces over others and the Chinese leadership's
willingness to accept domestic political costs to advance China's
foreign policy. Such action would not guarantee stability in China's
policy, but it would provide greater conªdence that China was willing to
accept a revised geopolitical status quo. Maybe more important, if China
were unwilling (or unable) to provide this ofªcial acceptance, the
United States would have to be more worried that China's leaders believe
that its role in East Asia requires pushing the United States out of the
region. A grand bargain would not constitute the entirety of U.S.
policy---unilateral measures and alliances would remain essential
components of the United States' policy toward Northeast Asia. When
uncertain about an adversary's motives or when facing a state with mixed
motives---a combination of security seeking and greed---a state should
pursue a mix of cooperative and competitive policies.107 [Maintaining
and enhancing U.S. commitments to the region would provide some of the
necessary balance in the overall policy of the United
States]{.underline}. These components of U.S. policy would be necessary
and appropriate even if China were unwilling to make the types of
concessions discussed above, but [they would become]{.underline} even
more [important in the context of a grand bargain. The key challenge is
for the United States to sustain its credibility for protecting its
allies]{.underline}.

Confrontation,

Robert Kaplan, one of the world's foremost experts on China, has stated
"**[The South China Sea will be the 21st Century's defining
battleground]{.underline}**." The obsession with supremacy in the South
China Sea is certainly not a new phenomenon in the realms of
international security and maritime strategy. In opinionated discussions
related to naval warfare, prominent political scientists and military
strategists have been addressing the geopolitical and military
significance of the region for decades. For example, the enlightening
1997 article "The Chinese Way", written in the Bulletin of Atomic
Scientists by Professor Chalmers Johnson of the University of
California-San Diego, noted significantly increased defense budgets and
expenditures in the region. In addition, the article eludes to the fact
that China had claimed the entire South China Sea and would use its
naval forces to counter any encroachment. [The argument for an increased
U.S. naval presence in East Asia is certainly not without precedent.
This contested aquatic region has tremendous geopolitical, strategic and
economic significance]{.underline}. While, the Persian Gulf has immense
importance and global recognition due to its strategic location in the
Middle East, as well its significance to global commerce, industry and
sought after oil, [the South China Sea is crucially important to nations
seeking to obtain their economic riches and geopolitical
advantages]{.underline}. The South China Sea is geographically located
near the Pacific Ocean and encompasses an area of 1.4 million square
miles (3.5 million square kilometers). As a semi-closed area, the South
China Sea extends from the Singapore Strait to the Taiwan Strait, with
China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Taiwan
surrounding it. [In terms of economic value, fishery stocks and
potential fossil fuel reserves are two major commodities that may spark
an armed conflict, even to the point of **nuclear
confrontation**.]{.underline} As a rich source of the region's staple
diet, fish, the sea guarantees a steady flow of food to the countries of
the region. Control and supremacy of the sea would also assure claiming
the much touted hydrocarbon reserves in the seabed, possibly exceeding
those of the OPEC nations such as Iraq and Kuwait. The conquest of this
vast resource would virtually assure energy independence and high
monetary returns for those that would gain supremacy over the South
China Sea. Thus, seizing the opportunity to gain dominance will lead to
control and manipulation of vital food and energy resources, economic
wealth and geopolitical power in the region. [A scenario of regional and
maritime domination and control could lead to the partial or total
exclusion of adjacent nation-states to access any food or natural
resources]{.underline} derived from a sea ruled with an iron hand;
[leading to a massive complex humanitarian catastrophe of immense
proportions from malnutrition and starvation, limitations in **energy
production**, and **economic collapse**.]{.underline} These factors make
the South China Sea a national security priority for nations in the
region, including one of the world's superpowers, China. The dependence
of China and other regional nations surrounding the South China Sea on
the Strait of Malacca is analogous in geopolitical and economic terms,
to the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Approximately one -third of
all global trade funnels through the strait and also serves as a conduit
for raw materials and energy needs for China and other adjacent
nation-states. [Such potential dominance in any region, leads to a
high-stakes game of brinkmanship, and at least the possibility of a
regional war which could conceivably escalate to engulf nation-states
external to the regional sphere. Tensions and skirmishes have the
propensity to evolve into armed conflict and **full-scale
war**]{.underline}, and apprehensive leaders and military planners in
such a contested region serve as the facilitators for disaster. China
continues to assert sovereignty by constructing man made islands using
sand dredged from the sea bottom and these artificial islands could be
militarized. China has even affirmed its desire to have a military
presence on these islands; however, the Chinese Foreign Minister Wang
Yi, also professes the use of these land masses to facilitate commerce
via shipping lanes and to protect Chinese fishing and other vessels from
piracy. China will never cease its quest for supremacy and its perceived
"ownership" of the South China Sea, as the legitimacy and structure of
the Chinese government is based on nationalism and achievement of the
"Chinese Dream". The Chinese regime continues to vehemently assert their
perceived "right" to the South China Sea, and it forges ahead with plans
and operations that could lead to naval warfare and conflict escalation.
The knowledge that China possesses formidable naval capacity and
capabilities, including nuclear-capable ballistic missile submarines,
is, indeed, disconcerting at the very least. As we examine and evaluate
the "submarine factor", it is evident that China's submarines have no
practical value in its disputes with Vietnam and the Philippines.
Essentially, nuclear ballistic missile capable submarines serve as a
deterrent against thermonuclear war. Without doubt, the primary reason
that China possesses nuclear-capable submarines is to deter an American
attack, although India's nuclear weapons are also a consideration for
Beijing. Nuclear capable submarines are capable of deep dive
capabilities and shorter launch to target times. While China's submarine
capabilities may appear worrisome to some, sudden deployment from port
in a geopolitical crisis would serve as a critical indicator to the US
and Western allies, and its submarine fleet still remains somewhat noisy
and detectable. China has already demonstrated its aggression at sea in
several instances, such as the ramming and sinking of a Vietnamese
fishing boat in disputed waters claimed by both countries in the region
and an ominous presence and military mobilization exercises which have
been monitored by military and intelligence assets. A report by the
National Air and Space Intelligence Center, indicates that Chinese SSBNs
are able to target portions of the U.S. from strategic operational
positions near the Chinese coast. China's Global Times published an
unprecedented report that revealed a nuclear missile strike on the
western U.S. with JL-2 missiles could generate up to 12 million American
fatalities. The Obama administration and senior U.S. naval officials
have not retorted to China's claims of a potentially devastating nuclear
threat, which included graphics showing radiological plumes and
collateral damage induced by radiation. The possibilities of China's
anti-satellite strategies to disable communications and
intelligence-gathering capabilities must also be taken seriously. Most
assuredly, **[the South China Sea would serve as an obvious arena for
the projection of Chinese power, including]{.underline}** conventional
and, potentially, **[nuclear scenarios.]{.underline}**

#### AND, China will reduce capabilities threatening Taiwan. but [NOT without leverage]{.underline} -- unilateral reductions empowers HARDLINERS by making their current strategy look effective, which makes Taiwan war MORE LIKELY -- but the CP solves

**[Gross]{.underline}**, senior associate of Pacific Forum CSIS, a
non-profit research institute affiliated with the Center for Strategic
and International Studies, former director of legislative affairs at the
National Security Council in the White House, former counselor of the
U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, **[2012]{.underline}**

(Donald, *The China Fallacy*, p.161-162)

[If China were to permanently eliminate the missiles facing
Taiwan]{.underline}, [while significantly and verifiably reducing and
redeploying the air and naval forces currently threatening the
island]{.underline}, [Taiwan\'s security would be markedly
improved]{.underline}. [This outcome can be achieved through **mutual
threat reduction measures** that **reduce**]{.underline}, eliminate and
redeploy [advanced weapons and military equipment that]{.underline}
either [Taiwan or China could employ in the event of
conflict]{.underline}. [Such measures would make it far more difficult
for either side to threaten or intimidate the other for political
purposes]{.underline}, [in addition to significantly lowering their
capacity to wreak destruction during an actual war]{.underline}.

[Because Taiwan is]{.underline} now [militarily inferior to China with
regard to missiles]{.underline}, [naval vessels and air force
assets]{.underline}, [it **lacks the diplomatic leverage** to eliminate
the security threat that China poses]{.underline}. Short of agreeing to
reunification---which is currently opposed by a majority of Taiwan\'s
citizens---[there are no measures Taiwan can offer as **a sufficient
quid pro quo to secure significant Chinese arms
reductions**]{.underline}. And, [without reciprocal security
measures]{.underline}, [China **refuses to engage in**]{.underline} what
it considers **["unilateral disarmament."]{.underline}**

By contrast, [the U.S. is **capable of securing a drastic reduction in
China\'s military threat to Taiwan** by offering **reciprocal military
measures** that would lead to **far greater stability in the
region**]{.underline}, [creating a transformed regional security
environment]{.underline}. [China is highly likely to
reduce]{.underline}, redeploy and eliminate [its missile]{.underline},
[naval and air forces now threatening the island]{.underline}, **[in
exchange for the U.S. pulling back forces]{.underline}** now engaged in
surveillance and patrolling of Chinese territory, **[significantly
reducing U.S. military deployments in the Asia Pacific]{.underline}**,
and scaling down major arms sales to Taiwan.

It is also important to recall that Taiwan\'s prior negotiations with
China on long-term political issues reflect the profound difficulty the
two sides face in reaching an agreement that could truly stabilize their
relations for the foreseeable future. Taiwan understandably fears being
absorbed by China, knowing full well that Beijing\'s foremost objective
is national reunification at the earliest possible time. A large
majority of Taiwan\'s people reject Beijing\'s promise to guarantee the
island\'s autonomy and democratic political system through a so-called
"one country, two systems" formula. For its part, China worries that
Taiwan\'s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), though currently out of
power, could strongly re-emerge in the future, and once again lead a
drive for political independence which effectively thwarts national
reunification.

[A Framework Agreement would strengthen the security of
Taiwan]{.underline} and the preservation of its democratic political
system [without requiring it to agree to eventual reunification with
China]{.underline}. [It would be entirely up to the Taiwanese government
and people whether to conduct bilateral negotiations on political
reunification at some future time]{.underline}. [The two sides would be
able to carry out their negotiations in a largely **non-threatening and
stable security environment**]{.underline}, [which would help
support]{.underline}, [in and of itself]{.underline}, **[a successful
agreement on difficult political issues]{.underline}**.

[Eliminating the Risk of a U.S.-China military conflict]{.underline}

[The proposed]{.underline} security measures in a [Framework Agreement
would end the current military standoff over Taiwan as well as the
broader friction arising from aggressive U.S. air and sea surveillance
along China\'s coast]{.underline}. [Whenever China-Taiwan relations
become acrimonious]{.underline}---as they typically do when the
Taiwanese political party favoring independence is in power or when
Chinese leaders play to nationalist public opinion and threaten a future
attack on the island---[it greatly heightens the security risks that the
U.S. faces in Asia]{.underline}. [In the event of an imminent or actual
attack on Taiwan]{.underline}, [the U.S. would almost certainly send
military forces to the island\'s aid]{.underline}, with proponents of
intervention [citing U.S. obligations under the Taiwan Relations
Act]{.underline}. National security strategists would argue that a
military response is essential to ensure the credibility of the overall
U.S. security posture in Asia, particularly the defense commitments to
Japan and South Korea.

[The current standoff over Taiwan effectively puts the U.S. at the mercy
of political elements in China and Taiwan that seek to achieve their
goals without regard for U.S. interests]{.underline}. [Those interests
include both protecting Taiwan and avoiding a war with China that could
conceivably **escalate to a nuclear exchange**]{.underline}. [By

If accommodation on Taiwan would increase U.S. security even without
reciprocal Chinese concessions, then it is necessary to consider whether
the greater beneªts that would be provided by a grand bargain warrant
the risks of forgoing the beneªts of unilateral accommodation
altogether. In other words, if a grand bargain is likely infeasible,
should the United States unilaterally end its commitment to Taiwan? It
is necessary to consider this possibility because the long-standing
disputes in the South China and East China Seas might continue to defy
resolution. Possibly most signiªcant, the recent escalation of tensions
between China and Japan, and the hardening of their positions, suggests
that the prospects for resolution of the Senkaku/Diaoyu dispute are
decreasing. [Although the probability of achieving a grand bargain may
be low, **the United States should not** now **unilaterally end its
commitment to defend Taiwan. China appears too likely to misinterpret
such a large change** in U.S. policy, which could **fuel Chinese
overconªdence** and **intensify challenges to U.S. interests**---most
importantly, the U.S. security role in Northeast Asia. In large part,
this judgment is informed by China's more assertive regional policies
and pronouncements over the past decade]{.underline}. I do believe,
though, that this is a close call. Prior to 2008 or so, unilateral
accommodation might have been the United States' best option. Thus, a
sustained moderation in China's policies could support a different
decision in the future. Finally, U.S. pursuit of a grand bargain would
not prevent the United States from eventually moving to unilateral
accommodation---[if during U.S. pursuit of a grand bargain China made
clear that agreement was impossible, unilateral accommodation would
remain a fallback option. U.S. unilateral adoption of less dramatic
changes in the government's Taiwan policy---most importantly, slowing or
ending U.S. arms sales to Taiwan110---is an option that might provide a
better balance of risks and beneªt. Even this much smaller change in
U.S. policy, however, risks sending China the wrong signal]{.underline}.
Another way to balance feasibility and beneªts, therefore, could be to
look for a path that divides the grand bargain into smaller, more
attainable increments. One can imagine [a series of steps, including the
United States ending its arms sales to Taiwan and China ending its use
of force]{.underline} to advance its maritime claims, [that could be
implemented sequentially to create a phased grand bargain. This approach
would enable the United States to revert to its current Taiwan policy if
China failed to uphold its side of the phased agreement]{.underline}.
Another possibility might include partial resolution of the maritime
disputes. An agreement that delayed resolution of the sovereignty
disputes far into the future, or indeªnitely, while settling the
resource disputes would be more feasible to achieve than a full
resolution. This type of agreement could be possible because, for the
most part, the sovereignty disputes can be separated from the resource
disputes. In fact, China and Japan reached this type of arrangement in
2008, although it has yet to be implemented.111 The United States could
pursue a variant of this staged approach that would enable it to try to
push the diplomatic process forward.

(Charles L., \"A U.S.-China Grand Bargain?\" *International Security*
Volume 39, Number 4, Project Muse)

U.S. accommodation of China deserves serious analysis for two reasons.
First, both intuition and international relations theory suggest that a
rising power, especially one that has experienced tremendous growth, can
reasonably expect to increase its geopolitical influence and more fully
achieve its goals, especially when these goals involve its national
security. [Bargaining theories maintain that the probability of war is
greater when there is a larger disparity between the distribution of
benefits in the existing territorial status quo and the balance of
power]{.underline}.3 Accommodation that reduces this disparity can,
under some conditions, reduce the probability of war and increase the
declining state's security.

Second, the pressures created by the international structure---the
combination of material and information conditions that constrain
states' international options---should allow China to rise peacefully,
which, somewhat counterintuitively, increases the potential importance
of accommodation. If the international structure were driving the United
States and China toward a major conflict, the concessions required of
the United States would be extremely large and costly. Even then, they
might do little to moderate the intense competition. But, because the
international structure is not creating such intense pressures,
[concessions that do not compromise vital U.S. interests may have the
potential to greatly diminish growing strains in U.S.-China
relations]{.underline}, thereby [moderating future military and foreign
policy competition between the two powers]{.underline}.

More concretely, regional dangers dwarf international structural
dangers. [Northeast Asia is plagued by territorial and maritime disputes
that are straining political relations both within the region and across
the Pacific]{.underline}. **[Only one of these
disputes]{.underline}**---[China's opposition to U.S. involvement in
protecting Taiwan]{.underline}---[seems important enough to]{.underline}
possibly [bring the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[and China into conflict]{.underline}. Even Taiwan, however, is a
secondary, albeit not insignificant, U.S. interest. Other lesser
disputes are currently roiling China's relationships with many of its
neighbors, but none appear sufficiently significant \[End Page 50\] that
they should derail China's peaceful rise. Nevertheless, recent events
demonstrate that even these seemingly minor disputes---for example, over
the status of the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands---can have an outsized negative
impact on U.S.-China relations. Thus, [the question arises whether
accommodation on Taiwan]{.underline} and possibly these still less
important issues [would help keep China's rise peaceful]{.underline},
[while the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [continued
to effectively protect its vital interests in the region]{.underline}.

[Accommodation could bring risks of its own]{.underline}. For example,
[it would jeopardize U.S. security if it were to convince China that the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [**lacked the resolve**
to protect its vital national interests]{.underline}, **[leading China
to adopt a more assertive foreign policy]{.underline}**. This danger
would be especially large if, instead of limited aims, China desired
regional hegemony and was determined to force the United States out of
East Asia. [Accommodation might also raise **serious concerns among U.S.
allies**]{.underline}---[most importantly]{.underline},
[Japan]{.underline}---[about the reliability of U.S. security
guarantees]{.underline}, thereby **[undermining alliances]{.underline}**
that are widely judged to be essential to the security of the United
States. Finally, [ending the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates'
[commitment to Taiwan could sacrifice important U.S. nonsecurity
interests]{.underline}, including support for democracy and individual
liberties, [with **no guarantee of benefits in return**]{.underline}.

[The grand bargain]{.underline} I propose [is designed to **capture the
benefits of U.S. accommodation with China**]{.underline}, **[while
reducing its risks]{.underline}**. [China's concessions]{.underline} on
its territorial and maritime disputes [would communicate information to
the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [about the limited
extent of its aims]{.underline}, thereby [reducing Washington's concern
that its own concessions would encourage China to **push the
U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[out of East
Asia]{.underline}**. In addition, [resolution of these disputes would
**eliminate flash points** that fuel regional military competition and

Accommodation on Taiwan would carry a variety of costs and risks for the
United States. The ªrst involves the potential costs to U.S. political
and ideological values. The United States has a signiªcant interest in
promoting and protecting freedom and democracy around the globe. Cutting
the U.S. commitment to Taiwan would put these values at risk. If China
were to gain control International Security 39:4 72 73. Andrew F.

Glaser, Rational Theory of International Politics. over Taiwan, its
authoritarian government might be unwilling to accept the political
institutions and personal freedoms that Taiwan's people currently enjoy.
Many proponents of preserving the U.S. commitment to Taiwan point to the
importance of protecting these values.77 I agree that these are
important values and that Washington should be reluctant to jeopardize
them. Nevertheless, states usually should, and usually do, give priority
to their key national security interests. The United States should not
be an exception: it should pursue these political and ideological
interests only if the risks to its national security are relatively
small in comparison. The next set of [potential risks concern U.S.
security. The ªrst of these involves possible reductions in China's
assessments of the United States' resolve for protecting its interests
in Northeast Asia]{.underline}. As discussed earlier, [territorial
accommodation can lead an adversary to doubt the state's resolve to
protect other interests, which is dangerous if the state's concessions
do not leave the adversary fully satisfied]{.underline}.78 Two
mechanisms could be at work here. One mechanism depends on China seeing
a similarity across one or more features of the potentially connected
interests, including their geography, the nature and extent of the U.S.
interests, and the U.S. history of involvement with these interests. If
China is uncertain about U.S. resolve to protect Taiwan and other
American interests, and if China believes that similar factors determine
U.S. resolve to protect all of these interests, then accommodation on
Taiwan would reduce U.S. credibility elsewhere. The other mechanism
comes into play if China believes that U.S. accommodation on Taiwan
reºects a change in a factor that also affects U.S. decisions on these
other issues; in that case, U.S. credibility on these issues would be
reduced. The broad change that is currently most relevant is the
shifting balance of power, speciªcally, increasing Chinese military
capabilities in East Asia. [If China's leaders believe that the United
States chose accommodation on Taiwan in response to China's growing
regional military capabilities, then they would also reasonably conclude
that the United States could be expected to make concessions on other
regional issues as wel]{.underline}l. A U.S.-China Grand Bargain? 73 77.
See, for example, Nancy Bernkopf Tucker and Bonnie Glaser, "Should the
United States Abandon Taiwan?" Washington Quarterly, Vol. 34, No. 4
(Fall 2011), p. 34. On the importance that U.S. elites place on
protecting democracy in Taiwan, see Kennedy, "China's Perceptions of the
U.S. Intentions toward Taiwan," pp. 279--282. 78. [Another danger, which
I address below, is that concessions could increase the domestic
political influence of Chinese proponents of more assertive
policies---including nationalists and the military---thereby resulting
in China becoming greedier and more expansionist]{.underline}. These are
standard second-image reversed arguments. See Peter Gourevitch, "The
Second Image Reversed: The International Sources of Domestic Politics,"
International Organization, Vol. 32, No. 4 (Autumn 1978), pp. 881--912;
and Charles L. Glaser, "Political Consequences of Military Strategy:
Expanding and Reªning the Spiral and Deterrence Models," World Politics,
Vol. 44, No. 4 (July 1992), pp. 519--525. For discussions that allude to
this type of interaction in the Chinese context, see Kenneth Lieberthal
in Lieberthal and Wang Jisi, "An Overview of the U.S.-China
Relationship," in Hachigian, Debating China, p. 4; and Christensen,
"Fostering Stability or Creating a Monster?" p. 111. These mechanisms
are reºected in prominent arguments against accommodation of Beijing on
Taiwan. For example, [Nancy Tucker and Bonnie Glaser argue that "China
would respond to appeasement as have virtually all governments: It would
conclude that a weaker United States lacking vision and ambition could
be pressured and manipulated]{.underline}."79 [Richard Bush argues,
"Should the United States concede to Beijing on Taiwan, the lessons that
China would learn about the intentions of the region's dominant power
would likely discourage moderation and accommodation on other issues,
like Korea or maritime East Asia]{.underline}."80 These are powerful
arguments, which the United States needs to take seriously. [There is a
clear similarity across the disputes---they are all located in East
Asia. Thus, China could be expected to reason that U.S. accommodation on
one of these disputes indicates a greater willingness to make
concessions on all the others. Arguably, ending the U.S. commitment to
Taiwan might even lead China to believe that its growing power will
enable its leadership to convince the United States to fully exit East
Asia]{.underline}. In addition, China's view of the shifting balance of
power could reinforce these conclusions: many Chinese ofªcials believe
that the shifting balance of power partly reºects the failings of the
U.S. domestic political system and the superiority of the China's model
of governance and development; the result is a new international system
in which China's growing power should generate greater inºuence and the
major powers should acknowledge its rising status.81 Because this
transformation inºuences all issues in East Asia, [U.S. accommodation on
Taiwan could validate]{.underline} these [expectations and put other
U.S. interests at greater risk]{.underline}. A second potential threat
to U.S. security is that territorial accommodation could reduce U.S.
military capabilities. Although numerous analysts suggest that China's
control of Taiwan would have this effect, little sustained analysis of
this issue is publically available. One possibility is that U.S.
accommodation would free up military forces and investments that China
now commits to coercing and if necessary attacking Taiwan, which would
in turn enable China to shift resource to better challenge the U.S.
ability to protect the East Asian SLOCs and possibly beyond.82 According
to this argument, because the International Security 39:4 74 79. Tucker

U.S.-China Strategic Distrust, pp. 8--11. 82. On the possibility that
the Chinese navy might be able to expand its reach into the Indian
Ocean, see Michael J. Green and Andrew Shearer, "Deªning U.S. Indian
Ocean Strategy," Washington Quarterly, Vol. 35, No. 2 (Spring 2012), pp.
180--181, 186. Taiwan mission has absorbed the vast majority of the
Chinese army's force modernization and organizational training,83 the
resources made available for other missions would be large.84 This
danger is smaller than critics suggest, however. If China decides to
fully pursue more ambitious missions, it would have to make large
investments that would likely dwarf the amount it is spending on
Taiwan-speciªc missions. Consequently, whether China eventually gains
control of Taiwan is unlikely to be decisive in determining China's
ability to invest in efforts to control the South China and East China
Sea SLOCs, and beyond. Related, it is likely that Chinese capabilities
dedicated to Taiwan will eventually become so effective that Beijing
will be able to reallocate some of its future military investment to
other missions.85 Moreover, ending the U.S. commitment to Taiwan could
reduce China's determination to pursue more challenging distant naval
missions because the United States will not interrupt these SLOCs,
except possibly during a severe crisis or major war. Eliminating the
possibility of war over Taiwan would therefore greatly reduce Beijing's
incentives to make investments in these missions. China could, however,
pursue greatly expanded power projection capabilities for a variety of
other reasons,86 including worstcase planning that imagines the United
States will interrupt its SLOCs under even the most unlikely conditions,
a Mahanian view of naval power that connects "commercial health with
naval primacy,"87 or the belief that superpower status requires power
projection capabilities.88 Finally, one should not exaggerate the
security risks of being unable to fully control these SLOCs. The United
States does not need to control the Strait of Malacca and the East Asian
SLOCs to enable shipping to reach Japan during a war with China.
Instead, bypass routes could allow shipping to reach oil ports on
Japan's east coast.89 Also, the A U.S.-China Grand Bargain? 75 83. Mark

ability to deny China use of these SLOCs would be sufªcient to preserve
the U.S. ability to coerce China. Taiwan's geographic location creates
another possible military danger by giving China the opportunity to
deploy its forces further forward.90 For example, Chinese control of
Taiwan would provide China's navy more direct access to the open Paciªc,
which might increase China's power project capabilities.91 Chinese
analysts identify the importance of Taiwan for enabling China to "break
through" the barrier created by Japan, including the Ryukyu Islands,
Taiwan, and the Philippines.92 In a similar vein, Toshi Yoshihara and
James Holmes, of the U.S. Naval War College, argue: "Control of
Taiwan\... would allow the PLA to erect its own Great Wall at sea,
giving Beijing some say over the exercise of foreign naval and military
power in nearby seas and skies. . . . Analysts view Taiwan as the one
geographic asset that can grant Chinese forces direct access to the
Paciªc. If the island is a guard tower in an offshore Great Wall, then
its offensive value is unmatched."93 Dissecting the strategic value of
Taiwan requires assessing how Chinese control would inºuence China's
ability to perform speciªc military missions. Available analyses provide
little reason to worry that possession of Taiwan would signiªcantly
increase China's military reach or its ability to project power.94
Control of Taiwan would, however, enhance China's A2/AD capabilities by
increasing its ability to send submarines into the Philippine Sea. Owen
Coté explains that Taiwan plays an important role in enabling the United
States "to form effective acoustic barriers through which Chinese
\[diesel attack submarines/guided missile diesel submarines\] must pass
in transiting" from the shallow waters along China's coast into the deep
water of the Philippine Sea.95 This access is valuable because the
United States plans to operate carrier battle groups in the Philippine
Sea and Chinese diesel submarines would make these operations more
difªcult and riskier. The impact of losing this antiInternational

How would a reduced US security commitment to Taiwan affect the
likelihood of cross-Strait conflict? More concretely, what would happen
if the United States were to terminate arms sales to the island?
Remember that in our simple model conflict occurs if Taiwan claims a
level of sovereign status to the left of point R on the I-U continuum.
How, then, might an end to arms sales affect the probability that
Taiwan's claimed status would lie to the left of point R? Here, we begin
by considering the most intuitive, direct ways that changing levels of
arms sales to Taiwan could affect the parameters of the model and the
associated implications. In the following subsection, we consider more
indirect and nonintuitive effects of ending arms sales, which in turn
serve to qualify points made in this subsection. [Intuitively, it would
seem that US arms sales to Taiwan directly affect both the costs (cc )
that China would expect to pay in a cross-Strait military conflict and
the probability (p) that China would win such a conflict]{.underline}.
On the margins at least, arms sales should improve Taiwan's military
capabilities relative to those of the PRC, thereby reducing p and
increasing cc . Of course, p and cc are determined not simply by the
balance of power between China and Taiwan but also by likely US behavior
in the event of a cross-Strait war: [US intervention would at a minimum
greatly complicate the PRC's ability to prevail in a cross-Strait war
and would certainly increase China's expected costs of such a conflict.
Thus a higher likelihood of US intervention implies a smaller p and a
larger cc . Arms sales to Taiwan, in turn, may signal some level of US
commitment to the island. To the extent that arms sales to Taiwan do in
fact increase confidence in Beijing and Taipei that the United States is
likely to intervene in a cross-Strait conflict, continued US arms sales
to Taiwan imply a smaller p and larger cc than would be the case in the
counterfactual world where the United States did not sell weapons to
Taiwan. These direct effects suggest, then, that ending arms sales
should reduce China's expected costs of war and increase the probability
of PRC victory; R, in turn, should shift to the right. This makes
intuitive sense: to the extent that the balance of power in the Taiwan
Strait favors the PRC, we might expect Beijing to be more demanding on
sovereignty issues]{.underline} (and less tolerant of outcomes that
diverge sharply from its ideal point of unification). [Were R to shift
to the right of Taiwan's actual status, the model suggests that the PRC
would prefer to fight a war rather than to accept a continuation of that
status quo]{.underline}; military conflict would ensue if Taiwan failed
to accommodate this new reality by redefining its sovereign status
(i.e., to push the status This content downloaded from 129.170.195.144

https://about.jstor.org/terms A Farewell to Arms? 229 quo back to the
right of R). [Given the obviously high costs of war for Taiwan---costs
that would presumably be especially high in the absence of any US
security commitment to the island---leaders in Taipei would have strong
incentives to avoid this outcome by bowing to new power realities and
accommodating the PRC on sovereignty issues to some degree. Yet there
are some reasons to think that accommodation in this regard would be
difficult]{.underline}. Recall that in recent decades the primary
strategic challenge in cross-Strait relations can be characterized as a
problem of deterrence, with the PRC trying to deter Taiwan efforts to
redefine its sovereign status in a way that conflicts with PRC hopes for
unification. But if R were to shift right of the status quo, the model
suggests that the cross-Strait relationship would instead be
characterized by a problem of compellence. Here, a war could occur, not
because the PRC fails to deter unilateral Taiwan changes to the status
quo, but rather because the PRC fails to compel Taiwan to alter the
status quo in a way that is more to Beijing's liking (remember that once
R shifts right of the status quo, Beijing's expected war payoff exceeds
its utility for a continuation of the status quo). Nevertheless,
commitment problems could complicate the search for a peaceful
accommodation even if Taiwan recognized that R had moved to the right of
the status quo and even if Taiwan was in principle willing to bargain
away some of its sovereignty.17 The reason is that the issue being
bargained over, Taiwan's sovereign status, could affect future
bargaining power between the two sides: that is, bargaining some of its
sovereign status to avoid war in the short term could further diminish
Taiwan's future bargaining power vis-à-vis Beijing. Even if the United
States were to stop selling arms to Taiwan and renounce any security
commitment to the island, Taiwan would remain qualitatively different
from areas under direct PRC control. It would continue to be
self-governing and democratic, it would continue to maintain armed
forces, and it would---for all intents and purposes---continue to
resemble an independent country on all dimensions except international
legal recognition. But Taiwan's continued otherness in this regard opens
the door to possible US intervention in a cross-Strait conflict even
after a US decision to end its security commitment to Taiwan. Leaders in
Washington, for instance, might revise their view of the PRC, especially
in the aftermath of an attack on Taiwan, and particularly if renouncing
the security commitment entailed a quid pro quo PRC pledge. Thus, even
after the United States ended arms sales to Taiwan and renounced a
security commitment to the island, the probability of US intervention in
a cross-Strait conflict would not drop to zero---in contrast to the
likelihood of US intervention in other areas of China such as Tibet (or,
for that matter, Hong Kong). But the more Taiwan accommodated PRC
demands by allowing itself to become something more resembling Hong Kong
or Tibet than an independent country, then the more the probability of
US intervention would begin to approach zero as it does for other areas

Chapter Twelve PRC control. Such intervention would increasingly, and
unambiguously, represent intervention in a civil, rather than an
international, conflict.18 Thus any bargain involving a reduction in
Taiwan's sovereignty should independently reduce Beijing's expected
costs of war, thus pushing R even further to the right. The credibility
of Beijing's commitment to such a bargain would therefore be suspect, as
once it was implemented Beijing would have incentives to demand an even
more favorable bargain (and Taiwan would not be in a position where it
could refuse). Fearon develops a similar model where states bargain over
strategic territory and the outcome of the negotiations explicitly
shifts the balance of power.19 This change in the balance of power
happens because the outcome of the negotiation transfers territory to a
rival state and thereby improves that rival's fighting capacity. When
this type of dynamic is at work, reaching a settlement becomes difficult
because the consequence of the shift in power caused by a settlement may
be less desirable than fighting and forgoing any negotiations. Although
a hypothetical bargain between the PRC and Taiwan is not over strategic
territory, it is certainly possible that a similar dynamic is at work as
the PRC and Taiwan negotiate over Taiwan's sovereignty. Inasmuch as
giving up sovereignty to the PRC strengthens the PRC's bargaining
leverage, Taiwan may come to the conclusion that risking war is
preferable to any negotiated settlement with the PRC over unification.
In other words, Taiwan may conclude that it would be better to roll the
dice in a war with China today than to accept the terms of an
obsolescing bargain likely to result in a progressively more subordinate
status within a unified China. Therefore, in the same way that
bargaining over strategic territory is complicated by the strategic
consequences of any deal that might be struck, bargaining over
unification can be dangerous because it has implications for the future
bargaining power of the PRC and Taiwan. In summary, ending arms sales to
Taiwan would have the potential to increase instability in the Taiwan
Strait. Such a shift in US policy could alter the balance of power in
the Taiwan Strait, which in turn could shift the strategic dynamic from
deterrence to compellence. In turn, there are reasons to believe that a
China-Taiwan relationship in which China tried to compel steps toward
unification would be more conflict prone than one where the PRC tried to
deter Taiwan steps toward independence, as credible commitment problems
could make it difficult for Taiwan to accommodate new power realities.
WHY ENDING US ARMS SALES TO TAIWAN WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE
DESTABILIZING The analysis above suggests that ending arms sales to
Taiwan would be destabilizing if doing so had enough of an effect on p
and cc to push R to the right of the This content downloaded from
129.170.195.144 on Thu, 11 Jul 2019 13:43:00 UTC All use subject to
https://about.jstor.org/terms A Farewell to Arms? 231 status quo.
However, there are reasons to question whether ending sales would indeed
have such a large effect. On the one hand, as the balance of power in
the Taiwan Strait continues to shift in China's favor, it is not obvious
that the arms themselves have a large impact on that shifting power
balance. Whether the sales do in fact have a significant effect in this
regard, moreover, will likely depend heavily on the types of weapons the
United States would be willing to sell to Taiwan (and which weapons
Taiwan would be willing to buy). For instance, some have suggested that
Taiwan's efforts to purchase high-profile and expensive packages such as
the F-16C/D fighter are counterproductive given their high cost and the
PRC's growing air capabilities; according to these analysts, more
mundane (and cheaper) systems are likely to be more effective at
countering PRC capabilities.20 Whether ending arms sales has a
significant effect on p and cc , then, will hinge in part on what types
of weapons the United States would sell Taiwan if arms sales were to
continue. Likewise, it is not self-evident how large of a signaling
effect arms sales have. As we show in the next section, US arms sales
send the clearest signal of US support for Taiwan when the sales are
costly for the United States to undertake. Yet it is quite clear not
only that the sales do not appear to be especially costly for Washington
but also that many in the United States actually benefit economically
and politically from the sales. When the Obama administration was
considering the F-16C/D package in 2011, for instance, a large number of
US senators signed a letter to the president urging the sale to go
forward; often, the signatories represented states that stood to benefit
economically from increased demand for the fighter jets.21 In other
words, so long as Chinese retaliation against the United States for
selling weapons remains limited, the costs of the policy to Washington
do not appear especially high. Thus it would not appear to us that arms
sales represent an especially strong signal of US commitment to Taiwan,
meaning that ending the sales would not necessarily lead Taiwan and
China to dramatically alter their assessments of likely US behavior in
the event of a cross-Strait conflict. It is also worth emphasizing that
many factors besides US arms sales to Taiwan determine the value of p
and cc , including Taiwan's indigenous military capabilities, the PRC's
capabilities, the level of economic integration across the Taiwan
Strait, and so forth. The rapid growth in cross-Strait economic
integration and cooperation in recent decades, combined with China's
general integration into global markets, for instance, suggests that the
costs for China of a cross-Strait military confrontation are probably
quite high---even if the PRC would likely win such a confrontation.
Compared to these costs, the dent to cc caused by reduced arms sales
could actually be quite small. Finally, and perhaps most importantly,
ending arms sales to Taiwan could actually increase cc in some ways.
[While critics sometimes suggest that ending arms]{.underline} This

sales [might simply whet the appetite of China and encourage further
demands on the United States, it is also conceivable---**as proponents
such as Glaser argue**---that ending arms sales would lead to
significant improvement in the US-China relationship]{.underline}.22
Furthermore, whether the United States sells weapons to Taiwan or not,
it is hard to imagine a strong and cooperative US-China relationship
withstanding PRC coercion against the island. Therefore, if the PRC
values a stable US-China relationship, and if ending arms sales to
Taiwan does in fact lead to an improved Sino-American relationship, then
ending arms sales to Taiwan will also mean that the PRC will have more
to lose (in terms of a strong US-China relationship) by initiating
conflict in the Taiwan Strait. [If this sort of effect outweighs the
direct effect of ending arms sales on China's costs of war, then ending
arms sales could help to reinforce a stable status quo]{.underline}.
SUMMARY In sum, even in the context of our highly stylized and
simplified model of crossStrait relations, changes in US policy have
complex and uncertain net implications for stability in the Taiwan
Strait. Analysts should recognize that ending arms sales to Taiwan could
be highly destabilizing: such a change in US policy could help to tip
cross-Strait relations from a relatively stable deterrence relationship
to an unstable compellence relationship. But ending arms sales will not
necessarily have this effect and could actually contribute to stability
in the Taiwan Strait by reinforcing China's stake in a stable status
quo. It is our hope that our model will help to organize thinking around
this important topic, by showing how different types of effects fit
together

Over the past decade, China's rise has generated much attention,
admiration, and concern. Whether China can rise peacefully remains a
heavily debated issue, with political scientists worrying about the
dangers of power transitions, aspiring regional hegemons, and growing
nationalism.1 In response to China's economic and military growth, the
administration of Barack Obama has rebalanced U.S. foreign and security
policy toward Asia, a decision that is generating considerable debate
over whether the United States is doing too little or too much to
confront China. Despite this intense focus, the United States has yet to
confront fully the most challenging question posed by China's rise:
Should the United States pursue a strategy of limited geopolitical
accommodation to avoid conflict?2 Instead, U.S. policy continues to
focus entirely on preserving the geopolitical status quo in Northeast
Asia. This article argues that a more fundamental revision of U.S.
policy is needed. Specially, [the United States should negotiate a grand
bargain that ends its commitment to defend Taiwan against Chinese
aggression. In return, China would peacefully resolve its maritime and
land disputes in the South China and East China Seas, and officially
accept the United States' long-term military security role in East
Asia]{.underline}. [U.S. accommodation of China deserves serious
analysis for two reasons. First, both intuition and international
relations theory suggest that a rising power, especially one that has
experienced tremendous growth, can reasonably expect to increase its
geopolitical influence and more fully achieve its goals, especially when
these goals involve its national security. Bargaining theories maintain
that the probability of war is greater when there is a larger disparity
between the distribution of benefits in the existing territorial status
quo and the balance of power.3 Accommodation that reduces this disparity
can, under some conditions, reduce the probability of war and increase
the declining state's security. Second, the pressures created by the
international structure---the combination of material and information
conditions that constrain states' international options---should allow
China to rise peacefully, which, somewhat counterintuitively, increases
the potential importance of accommodation. If the international
structure were driving the United States and China toward a major
conflict, the concessions required of the United States would be
extremely large and costly. Even then, they might do little to moderate
the intense competition. But, because the international structure is not
creating such intense pressures, concessions that do not compromise
vital U.S. interests may have the potential to greatly diminish growing
strains in U.S.-China relations, thereby moderating future military and
foreign policy competition between the two powers. More concretely,
regional dangers dwarf international structural dangers. Northeast Asia
is plagued by territorial and maritime disputes that are straining
political relations both within the region and across the Pacific. Only
one of these disputes---China's opposition to U.S. involvement in
protecting Taiwan---seems important enough to possibly bring the United
States and China into conflict]{.underline}. Even Taiwan, however, is a
secondary, albeit not insignificant, U.S. interest. Other lesser
disputes are currently roiling China's relationships with many of its
neighbors, but none appear sufficiently significant

U.S.-China relations. Thus, the question arises whether [accommodation
on Taiwan]{.underline} and possibly these still less important issues
[would help keep China's rise peaceful, while the United States
continued to effectively protect its vital interests in the
region.]{.underline}

Gordon Chang, author of The Coming Collapse of China, recently claimed
that **[the South China Sea could become the next "Great War
Zone."]{.underline}** Chang said last week at a panel discussion held by
the U.S. Air Force Association that it will not be long before the U.S.
takes initiatives to respond to China's unyielding attitude and behavior
in the South China Sea. He said the time frame is now. "The U.S. Navy is
clearly going to test China's claims of exclusion of the South China
Sea," Chang said. "We have to do that, because if there has been any
consistent American foreign policy over the course of two centuries, it
has been the defense of freedom of navigation." "Now China is infringing
on that notion at this time," Chang added. "I think we probably will act
in a very short time frame." Chang called it "a classic zero-sum game"
for China to challenge the U.S. in the South China Sea. He said China
sees the South China Sea as one of its core interests with no room for
negotiation, while the U.S. has been the influential maritime power for
the past two centuries. Both could concede on the South China Sea
issues, Chang said, but they will not abandon their long-held positions.
Rick Fisher, senior research fellow at the International Assessment and
Strategy Center, told VOA that attention should also be paid to the
development of nuclear weapons in China and North Korea. He said that
although North Korea stays quiet for now, it is likely to take advantage
of the South China Sea disputes in the foreseeable future. "As soon as
North Korea can demonstrate that it can fire a nuclear missile, then
North Korea becomes a factor because North Korea itself can decide to
take a period of high confrontation in the South China Sea and put
greater pressure on the United States in order to obtain concessions
from South Korea or the U.S. itself." So, Fisher said, "as soon as there
is a crisis, North Korea could become a very dangerous element." Fisher
said although Kim Jong Un has rifts with the Chinese government, both

IMPLICATIONS FOR U.S. INTERESTS [The United States has significant
political, security, and economic interests at stake]{.underline} if one
of the contingencies should occur. -- Global rules and norms. [The
United States has important interests in the peaceful resolution of
South China Sea disputes according to international law]{.underline}.
With the exception of China, all the claimants of the South China Sea
have attempted to justify their claims based on their coastlines and the
provisions of UNCLOS. China, however, relies on a mix of historic rights
and legal claims, while remaining deliberately ambiguous about the
meaning of the "nine-dashed line" around the sea that is drawn on
Chinese maps. [Failure to uphold international law and norms could harm
U.S. interests elsewhere in the region and beyond.]{.underline}
[Ensuring freedom of navigation is another critical interest of the
United States and other regional states. Although China claims that it
supports freedom of navigation, its insistence that foreign militaries
seek advance permission to sail in its two-hundred-mile EEZ casts doubt
on its stance]{.underline}. China's development of capabilities to deny
American naval access to those waters in a conflict provides evidence of
possible Chinese intentions to block freedom of navigation in specific
contingencies. -- [Alliance security and regional stability. U.S. allies
and friends around the South China Sea look to the United States to
maintain free trade, safe and secure sea lines of communication (SLOCs),
and overall peace and stability in the region]{.underline}. [Claimants
and nonclaimants]{.underline} to land features and maritime waters in
the South China Sea [view the U.S. military presence as necessary to
allow decision-making free of intimidation. If nations in the South
China Sea lose confidence in the United States to serve as the principal
regional security guarantor, they could embark on costly and potentially
destabilizing arms buildups to compensate or, alternatively, become more
accommodating to the demands of a powerful China.]{.underline} Neither
would be in the U.S. interest. [Failure to reassure allies]{.underline}
of U.S. commitments in the region [could also undermine U.S. security
guarantees in the broader Asia-Pacific region, especially with Japan and
South Korea]{.underline}. At the same time, however, the United States
must avoid getting drawn into the territorial dispute---and possibly
into a conflict---by regional nations who seek U.S. backing to
legitimize their claims. -- [Economic interests. Each year, \$5.3
trillion of trade passes through the South China Sea; U.S. trade
accounts for \$1.2 trillion of this total.]{.underline} Should a crisis
occur, the [diversion of cargo ships to other routes would harm regional
economies as a result of an increase in insurance rates]{.underline} and
longer transits. [Conflict of any scale in the South China Sea would
hamper the claimants from benefiting from the South China's Sea's proven
and potential riches]{.underline}. -- Cooperative relationship with
China. The stakes and implications of any U.S.-China incident are far
greater than in other scenarios. [The United States has an abiding
interest in preserving stability in the U.S.-China relationship so that
it can continue to secure Beijing's cooperation on an expanding list of
regional and global issues and more tightly integrate China into the
prevailing international system.]{.underline}

### 2NC ECS War

#### ECS disputes go nuclear

**[Ayson]{.underline}**, Professor of Strategic Studies -- Victoria

University's Strategic and Defense Studies Center,

(Robert, "Can a Sino-Japanese War Be Controlled?", Survival: Global
Politics and Strategy, Vol. 56, No. 6)

The role of nuclear weapons is one of the most important aspects of the
escalation question in North Asia, as China has a nuclear arsenal and
Japan relies on US extended deterrence. [If Beijing and Tokyo engage in
conventional]{.underline} military [conflict, **the prospects of direct
Sino-American nuclear escalation come into play more
clearly**]{.underline}. [One of the main concerns about]{.underline} the
possibility of such [escalation revolves around America\'s superiority
to China in]{.underline} terms of [conventional]{.underline} fighting
[power]{.underline}.41 While China is closing that gap, some American
conventional systems allow Washington to threaten China with accurate,
destructive strikes that Beijing cannot hope to replicate. [Should
Sino-American hostilities]{.underline} seem likely to [intensify, China
could be tempted to utilise its nuclear forces]{.underline}. In such a
conflict, however, Beijing should be aware that [any attempted nuclear
attack on the US would be]{.underline} almost [guaranteed to generate a
swift and]{.underline} probably [disproportionate nuclear
response]{.underline}. Mutual fear of [surprise attacks and inadvertent
nuclear war could not be ruled out]{.underline}, but nuclear deterrence
might well operate effectively.42

In the early stages of a conflict involving only China and Japan, the
nuclear question takes on a different perspective. Beijing would still
face the prospect of relative conventional-military weakness, especially
when it considered the possibility of American support to Tokyo. But if
China decided to escalate by threatening Japan with nuclear bombardment,
it would have to weigh the credibility of American extended deterrence,
some portion of which would almost certainly swing into action. At the
very least, China would have to deal with the costs of a strong
conventional response by the US.

One might expect that nuclear threats, implicit or otherwise, would
remain in the background. Washington could regard the threat of a
nuclear response as effective leverage, discouraging China from
escalating a conventional conflict with Japan without the need for heavy
US involvement in a conventional military contest. Similarly, China
might remind Japan about the existence of its nuclear forces, so as to
highlight the potential costs of conventional escalation. Testing an
intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) during early hostilities --
rather like the 2014 Russian test, apparently longscheduled, during the
Ukraine crisis -- could be such a signalling mechanism.

[If China suffers, or]{.underline} merely [fears]{.underline}, a
significant [attack on its command and control systems, there are
other]{.underline} material [reasons why nuclear escalation could become
more likely]{.underline}. Unlike the US or the Soviet Union during the
Cold War, [China lacks separate, redundant theatre and strategic
networks for C4ISR]{.underline}. [This increases the likelihood that
what Japan and]{.underline} especially [the US view as an escalating
conflict in the conventional domain could have]{.underline} quite [a
different appearance to Chinese decision-makers]{.underline}.
**[Conventional escalation could easily cause the US to take measures
that imperilled China\'s]{.underline}** control of its **[nuclear
systems]{.underline}**. Aware of its general C4ISR vulnerability,
Beijing would already have experienced considerable pressure to use its
antisatellite systems, anti-ship ballistic missiles (including the
DF21-D) and other anti-carrier weapons, and to accelerate its cyber
attacks.43 The US would likely respond to the use of these capabilities
by destroying all remaining Chinese force elements in any way connected
to them, which would have further C4ISR implications for China. America
could be expected to forgo attacks on Chinese urban--industrial centres
and many other force elements. Washington would seek to convey restraint
and selectivity in its response, but would already have provided Beijing
with a perverse incentive to use nuclear weapons pre-emptively, out of
fear that its capacity to maintain command and control of these systems
was being destroyed in the conventional conflict.

The concentrated, limited range of China\'s nuclear-powered
ballisticmissile submarines (SSBNs) and associated command, control and
communications systems would become an attractive target for the US soon
after the nuclear threshold had been crossed. China only has three SSBN
bases, which are also used by its attack submarines. Its single
Xia-class SSBN is based at Jianggezhuang, around 24km east of Qingdao,
and may never have become operational.44 The base also houses several
nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSNs), meaning that either
conventional or nuclear strikes on China\'s attack submarines could also
be interpreted as an attack on the Xia.45 The Chinese navy currently has
five Type-094 Jin-class SSBNs, which have 12 JL-2 submarine-launched
ballistic missiles each, and share two home ports. The first two vessels
in this class were based at Xiaopingdao, near Dalian in Liaoning
Province.46 Since December 2007, Jin SSBNs have also been seen moored at
Yulin naval base near Sanya (in Yalong Bay, on the southern coast of
Hainan Island), which reportedly has large underground facilities for
holding SSBNs.47 Moreover, the Chinese navy normally uses only two
high-powered VLF stations for communications with its SSBNs and attack
submarines. These are located at Changde and at the Datong naval base.
Although the navy has another six VLF stations that it could also use
(located at Fuzhou, Lushun, Qinghe, Yaxian, Yulin and Zhanjiang), they
make up part of a vulnerable infrastructure that could easily be
degraded.48

China\'s overlapping command arrangements and the co-location of some of
its main conventional and nuclear systems present particular escalatory
challenges. The PLA\'s Second Artillery Corps, for example, controls all
of China\'s land-based missiles, including conventional and
nuclear-armed missiles, and both ballistic-and cruise-missile forces.
The eight bases holding ICBMs also contain a mixture of intermediate-and
medium-range ballistic missiles, meaning that an attack on one is likely
to threaten the others. The Second Artillery Corps is headquartered just
north of Beijing. It has an alternative base in the hardened facility
under Yuquan Shan Mountain, which is located in the Western Hills just
outside the capital and is also used by the Central Military Commission.
As a result, the degradation or destruction of the headquarters of the
Second Artillery Corps could also substantially impair the commission\'s
national command-and-control capabilities.

[In the knowledge that its nuclear systems could]{.underline} also [be
affected by an early strike]{.underline} against conventional
command-and-control systems, **[China might face]{.underline}** complex
**[temptations to use them while it]{.underline}** still
**[could]{.underline}** (even if they were not targeted directly),
[where the alternative was to cope with]{.underline} major
[uncertainties about what it might be left with]{.underline} as the war
escalated. According to the US Department of Defense, the PLAN has a
limited capacity to communicate with submarines at sea, and Beijing has
no operational experience of managing a fleet of SSBNs conducting
strategic-deterrence patrols.49 Renmin University\'s Wu Riqiang has
argued that existing Chinese SSBNs are too noisy to operate beyond the
first island chain, where they would have a higher chance of
successfully striking the continental US.50 By comparison, the shallower
waters around mainland China have a much more complex acoustic
environment, which could hamper submarine-detection efforts. Owen Cote,
Jr, suggests that these waters would in a conflict situation 'constitute
a zone of "contested command" in which neither side can assure its use
of the sea surface for either commercial or military purposes'.51

Forced to launch from these shallower waters, China\'s relatively small
SSBN force would likely be countered by US (and, increasingly, Japanese)
ballistic-missile defence systems, and would hardly present Beijing with
a secure second-strike capability. As Wu suggests, 'China\'s SSBNs are
much more vulnerable than those of the Soviet Union. **[China\'s leaders
will face a much harder "use it or lose it" choice during a
crisis]{.underline}**. [The situation is more dangerous than during the
Cold War]{.underline}.'52

Moreover, [in the event of much more serious escalation]{.underline}
from the other side, [China would find it exceedingly difficult to
distinguish a deliberately crafted, limited nuclear strike]{.underline}
by the US [from a full-scale urban--industrial attack]{.underline}.
Since the 1960s, US nuclear-war plans have contained various options for
the use of strategic nuclear weapons against China; by the early years
of the George W. Bush administration, these ranged from limited attacks
in response to conflicts involving Taiwan and North Korea to
larger-scale efforts in which as many as 500 nuclear missiles would be
launched at the full range of Chinese nuclear-weapons sites,
conventional military bases, industrial areas and leadership
facilities.53

A more recent nuclear-war plan for a reduced US arsenal (which came into
effect in July 2012) is organised around four categories of nuclear
attack and contains dozens of limited options.54 [In the context of an
escalating war that had **begun as a small conflict between Japan and
China**, the US would]{.underline} presumably [have]{.underline} at
least [three different targeting missions in mind]{.underline}. These
would include attacks that met the extended-deterrence commitment to
Japan by destroying conventional targets and preventing China from
gaining the ascendancy; strikes on all facilities associated with a
Chinese assault on US satellites, aircraft carriers and undersea
sensors; and a response to Chinese nuclear pre-emption.55 [Coupled with
Beijing\'s diminished ability to judge the limits of a US
strike]{.underline} after its C4ISR systems had been damaged, [this
intermixture of conventional and nuclear targets creates a worrying
escalatory picture]{.underline}. **[An Asian nuclear war would be very
difficult to control]{.underline}**.

Once the US and the Soviet Union had reached a political stalemate and
informally acknowledged their common interest in avoiding a catastrophic
war, worries about escalation tended to include the possibility that
technical rather than political factors would allow a small conflict to
get out of hand. There were varying assessments of the ease with which a
war between the superpowers could be controlled in light of the
vulnerability of their command systems, but political factors were
rarely seen as a major, independent cause for concern.

[In the]{.underline} strategic [relationship between Japan and
China]{.underline}, however, [there are problems]{.underline} at both
the political and military--technical levels. Firstly, [there seems to
be minimal political understanding of]{.underline}, or commitment to,
[avoiding escalation]{.underline}. [It is hard to tell whether Japan and
China will see it as in their]{.underline} political [interests to
constrain]{.underline} what begins as a [minor conflict]{.underline}.
[These]{.underline} political obstacles [increase the pressure
created]{.underline} by military considerations [that encourage swift
escalation, **to the point at which**]{.underline} even **[nuclear
options seem attractive]{.underline}**. The close military links between
Japan and the US would not necessarily encourage restraint. [It may
be]{.underline} militarily [logical for the US to place China in a
position in which further escalation seemed tempting]{.underline}, while
it could be politically logical for Japan to create conditions in which
American action became more likely.

An initial [outbreak of hostilities between Japan and China over the
East China Sea]{.underline} could remain just that: a short, contained
exchange of fire and a sobering lesson that encouraged much-needed
efforts to improve communication and recognise their common interest in
avoiding conflict. But it [might]{.underline} also [veer out of
control]{.underline} before they had a chance to take preventative
measures. The [subsequent involvement of the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [could lead to **Asia\'s first serious war
involving nuclear-armed states**]{.underline}. And we have no precedent
to suggest how dangerous that would become.

### \--AT: No ECS War

**Senkaku war is likely and goes nuclear**

**[Bandow 2/12/17]{.underline}**

Doug Bandow is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and a former
special assistant to President Ronald Reagan, The National Interest,
February 12, 2017, "Are the Senkaku Islands Worth War Between China,
Japan and America?",
http://nationalinterest.org/feature/are-the-senkaku-islands-worth-war-between-china-japan-19403?page=show

**[Big wars sometimes start over small stakes.]{.underline}** For
instance, Germany's "Iron Chancellor," Otto von Bismarck, presciently
warned that a European war would begin as a result of "some damned
foolish thing in the Balkans." Soon, [a royal assassination]{.underline}
spawned World War I, which [spread conflict around the
globe.]{.underline}

**[National insults, trade opportunities and territorial claims also
resulted in their share of]{.underline}** stupid, **[counterproductive
conflicts]{.underline}**. The assertive young American republic
threatened Great Britain with war over the Canadian border and launched
an invasion to vindicate its dubious territorial claims against Mexico.
A few decades later, the slightly more mature United States fought a
lengthy counterinsurgency campaign against independence-minded Filipinos
to preserve its territorial booty from the Spanish-American War.

**[Alliances sometimes accelerate the race to war]{.underline}**.
Assured of the support of Russia and Germany, respectively, Serbia and
the Austro-Hungarian Empire were recklessly intransigent in summer 1914.
Greater flexibility might not have prevented the conflict, but
alliance-backed inflexibility ensured war.

**[History illustrates the dangers posed by the
Asia-Pacific's]{.underline}** many **[territorial
squabbles]{.underline}**. [None of the contested claims is worth a
fight, let alone a **great-power conflict**]{.underline}. **[Yet they
could become a spark like that in Sarajevo]{.underline}** a century ago.
Defense Secretary Jim [Mattis **increased the danger** on his recent
trip to Japan when he "reassured" the Abe government]{.underline} that
[Washington]{.underline}, DC [was firmly in its corner.]{.underline}

**[The Senkaku Islands]{.underline}**---called the Diaoyus by
China---are uninhabited rocks of limited intrinsic value. However, they
**[confer ocean and seabed control and corresponding fishing, navigation
and hydrocarbon benefits]{.underline}**. **[Nationalist sentiments
loom]{.underline}** equally **[large]{.underline}**. The islands are
controlled by Tokyo but also claimed by the People's Republic of China.
Beijing's case is serious---better, in my view, than its less credible
South China Sea claims---but Japan insists that there is no issue to
discuss.

**[That leaves the PRC with little choice but to adopt more
confrontational tactics to assert its "rights."]{.underline}** Tokyo
took direct control of the Senkaku Islands in 2012 to forestall their
use by nationalists for protests, which heightened tensions. The
following year, China declared an Air Defense Identification Zone over
the islands, though so far the ADIZ has more symbolic than real. The PRC
also has engaged in fishing and oil exploration in nearby waters,
sending in coast guard ships to defend Chinese operations.

Japan felt secure in its intransigence after winning the Obama
administration's commitment that the "mutual" defense treaty between the
two nations covered territory administered by the central government,
even if claimed by other states. Secretary Mattis was equally explicit.
He affirmed not only Washington's support for Japan's defense, but also
stated, "I made clear that our longstanding policy on the Senkaku
Islands stands. The United States will continue to recognize Japanese
administration of the islands, and as such Article 5 of the U.S.-Japan
Security Treaty applies." In other words, America will defend Tokyo's
contested claim.

The PRC responded sharply. The United States should "avoid making the
issue more complicated and bringing instability to the regional
situation," Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said. Indeed, he
explained, the U.S.-Japan security treaty is "a product of the Cold War,
which should not impair China's territorial sovereignty and legitimate
rights."

**[Adding to the combustible atmosphere is the apparent
belief]{.underline}**---**[of]{.underline}** at least **[some officials
on both sides]{.underline}**---**[that war is inevitable]{.underline}**.
For instance, less than a year ago Trump strategist Steve Bannon
expressed "no doubt" that "we're going to war in the South China Sea in
five to ten years." He complained that the Chinese are "taking their
sandbars and making basically stationary aircraft carriers and putting
missiles on those." While the Senkaku Islands are not part of the South
China Sea, the same principles apply.

War sounded almost close at Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's
confirmation hearing. He insisted: "We're going to have to send China a
clear signal that, first, the island-building stops and, second, your
access to those islands also is not going to be allowed." Using force to
do so would be an act of war against any country, including America.

Chinese responded accordingly. The People's Liberation Army website
quoted one senior officer as stating: "A 'war within the president's
term' or 'war breaking out tonight' are not just slogans, they are
becoming a practical reality." He called for increased military
deployments in the region.

The political leadership is less transparent about its views---the
residents of Zhongnanhai don't typically appear on radio shows. However,
Ian Bremmer of the Eurasia Group opined that "**[the Chinese government
is quite concerned about]{.underline}** the **[potential for direct
confrontation with the Trump administration]{.underline}**." Although
President Xi Jinping appears reasonably pragmatic while ruthlessly
repressive, he isn't likely to abandon what he sees as "core" Chinese
interests. Moreover, **[nationalists and unreconstructed
leftists]{.underline}**, though differing on economic policy, **[share a
distrust of the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates.

A **[mutual belief in]{.underline}** inevitable **[conflict could become
reality]{.underline}**. [Before World War I, a number of high-ranking
European officials believed that war was coming]{.underline}. For them,
[it made sense to]{.underline} accept, even [embrace, the onset of the
conflict]{.underline} in August 1914 [and **strike while victory still
remained possible.**]{.underline}

In the case of China versus the United States, such **[shared sentiment
may accelerate military spending]{.underline}**. The [Trump]{.underline}
administration [is demanding increased outlays]{.underline} despite the
lack of any serious threat to vital U.S. interests. Rather, the expanded
force is to enhance America's ability to intervene against other
nations, particularly China.

[This gives the PRC]{.underline} an [even greater incentive to
respond]{.underline}, since the United States is challenging what it
views (and America would view, if the situation was reversed) as "core"
national interests. As the United States increases military deployments
in the region, so will the PRC. After Mattis' visit, China sent three
warships near the Senkaku Islands. **[The risks of a violent clash will
rise accordingly.]{.underline}**

Some Washington officials might be tempted to advocate a more aggressive
approach today, while the PRC is weaker and America is wealthier, backed
by numerous allies and able to deploy a more powerful military. In this
view, let the inevitable showdown come sooner rather than later.

Alas, that could become a prescription for years if not decades of
conflict. America has a vital interest in protecting its own territory,
population, and constitutional and economic systems. But China threatens
none of them. The United States has important interests in the
independence of its allies and freedom of navigation in the Asia-Pacific
region. So far, the PRC has not challenged either of those things.

Washington understandably views its dominance of East Asia up to China's
borders as an advantage. But it is far less important than protecting
America's own security. Such control is not even necessary for
preserving navigational freedom and allied security. More important,
U.S. policy conflicts with what Beijing views as its "core" interests.
Imagine Washington's reaction if China attempted to maintain a similar
position along the eastern seaboard and in the Caribbean. [Nor does the
presumption that America could defeat the PRC offer much
comfort.]{.underline} **[The price would be high. China can build
missiles and submarines faster than the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[can construct aircraft carriers. The Chinese
people would be more committed to a fight]{.underline}** if it is seen
as protecting their homeland---more so than Americans would be prone to
getting involved in a faraway conflict that hampers Washington's will.

Additionally, the United States count on support from allies not
directly affected. Would Australia and South Korea risk the long-term
hostility of China, which will be in their next-door neighbor forever?
Indeed, Japan made clear that it would not join the United States'
"freedom of navigation operations" in the South China Sea. Explained
Japanese defense minister Tomomi Inada: "I told Secretary Mattis that
Japan supports the U.S. military's freedom of navigation operation in
the sea. But the \[Self Defense Force\] will not be sent to the area."
Inada clearly means "supports" in quotation marks.

Finally, **[an American "victory"]{.underline}** almost certainly
**[would guarantee long-term hostility and future
conflict]{.underline}**. It took two world wars to determine Germany's
place in the global order. And it took "only" two because, after the
second one, Germany ended up divided and well behind the United States
and Soviet Union. While the PRC's collapse as a country is possible, it
is unlikely. **[In fact, military defeat might spur nationalist rage and
result in greater centralization.]{.underline}**

[The Communist regime could fall. But that probably would spawn an
authoritarian government rather than a democracy. And any democracy is
more likely to be nationalist/populist than liberal]{.underline}.
Whether the almost inevitable "Second Sino-American War" likely would
turn out in Washington's favor is less clear. There could be a third one
as well, if China rebounded. The United States might find that just as
battles can be pyrrhic, so can wars. It's an experience America should
avoid.

U.S. officials have good reason to remind China of the costs of conflict
and the importance of settling even contentious territorial disputes
peacefully. At the same time, however, the Trump administration should
avoid issuing blank checks to allies seeming to exempt them from having
to deal with, and even discuss, those same territorial challenges.
Sometimes blank checks get cashed with disastrous consequences, like
Imperial Germany's support for the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which sped
Europe's plunge into the World War I abyss.

**[The Senkaku Islands are of little practical importance]{.underline}**
to China and Japan, and essentially of no importance to America. **[But
as the locus of a dangerous game of geopolitical chicken, they could
spark another Sino-Japanese war, which would be
disastrous]{.underline}**. **[And if that turned into a Sino-American
conflict, the consequences would be incalculable]{.underline}**.
President Donald Trump should never forget these dangers as he confronts
China's growing ambition and power.

### 2NC Impact---Coop

Taiwan makes coop impossible but the CP solves

**[Glaser]{.underline}**, professor in the Elliott School of
International Affairs and the Department of Political Science at George
Washington University, fellow in the Kissinger Institute at the Woodrow
Wilson International Center for Scholars, **['15]{.underline}**

(Charles L., "A U.S.-China Grand Bargain? The Hard Choice between
Military Competition and Accommodation," International Security Volume
39, Number 4, Spring 2015)

TAIWAN IS NO LONGER THE KEY ISSUE

**[A second counterargument is that Taiwan is no longer the key issue
straining U.S.-China relations.]{.underline}** Consequently, focusing on
Taiwan is misguided. As discussed earlier, [cross-strait relations have
been improving for many years]{.underline}. [At the same time, China\'s
disputes with its neighbors in the South China and East China Seas have
become more intense]{.underline}, and increasingly define day-to-day
tensions in the region. Possibly most worrisome, Sino-Japanese relations
have become increasingly strained in the past few years, taking the
spotlight off Taiwan.

[Two rejoinders help to put this counterargument into
perspective]{.underline}. As I have already argued, [the dangers
generated by the U.S. commitment to Taiwan go **well beyond** **the
immediate possibility of the United States fighting China to protect
Taiwan**]{.underline} and, therefore, **[are not adequately captured by
focusing solely on the cross-strait relationship]{.underline}**. [The
U.S. commitment]{.underline} [to Taiwan is among the **key
factor**]{.underline}s [fueling **Chinese doubts about U.S. motives in
the region**]{.underline} [and Chinese worries about a war over Taiwan
make **control of the Northeast Asian SLOCs** far more important. These
worries contribute to **military competition and strained political
relations**]{.underline}, thereby **[increasing the probability of
conflict over the longer term.]{.underline}** Second, [a grand bargain
would **deal fully** with this]{.underline} counterargument by requiring
resolution of these other disputes.

#### Extinction---The CP's model prevents global nuclear war, proliferation, and warming

**[2015]{.underline}**

(Lyle, *Meeting China Halfway*, pg. 360-1)

[Great power rivalry is a force of nature that is nearly impossible to
control]{.underline}. [Its dynamics are amply clear in contemporary
US-China relations]{.underline}. However, [thinking and responsible
people need not accept **war**]{.underline}, rivalry, and the inability
to cooperate **[as inevitable outcomes]{.underline}**. [The imperative
to prevent an **apocalyptic World War**]{.underline} III, [the obvious
dangers of regional conflict flowing from **nuclear
proliferation**]{.underline}, [and the ever-clearer menace of **global
warming** must inspire us to collectively struggle against the
inexorable drive toward intensified US-China rivalry]{.underline}. One
model [to escape this]{.underline} perverse [dynamic]{.underline} is
provided in this book in the form of "**[cooperation
spirals]{.underline}**," which [are built on]{.underline} the principles
of gradualism, **[reciprocity]{.underline}**, **[and mutual
compromise]{.underline}**. [This **model** can be adapted to restrain
**all aspects of US-China rivalry**]{.underline}, from the South China
Sea to the Korean Peninsula and from economic tensions to climate change
negotiations. Such steps toward compromise can be debated and altered,
reversed and reformulated. Here, one hundred steps are suggested; but
there are thousands of alternative steps that need to be suggested,
examined, and refined. Indeed, Steinberg and O'Hanlon's 2014 book
usefully proposes a whole panoply of alternatives, ranging from
traditional arms control efforts to a "cyber risk reduction center,"
which deserve careful consideration and might also fit well into
"cooperation spirals." 59 I do not for a minute underestimate the
difficulties involved in negotiating these painful compromises, which
will necessarily involve "games" on at least two levels, international
and domestic.

they focused on issues like currency-exchange rates, trade barriers and
China\'s never-ending disputes with Taiwan. In 2009, shortly after
Obama\'s inauguration, [the U.S. pushed to add climate change to the
mix]{.underline}, hoping that a better understanding between the U.S.
and China would lead to a better deal at the Copenhagen climate summit
that year. ([It didn\'t help -- **mistrust between the countries** was a
large part of the reason why the talks imploded.]{.underline})

This year\'s U.S. delegation includes many of the administration\'s most
influential climate hawks -- Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, top climate
negotiator Todd Stern and John Podesta, counselor to Obama, who has
become the administration\'s de facto point man for climate policy. This
is the diplomatic equivalent of a full-court press. In the past couple
of years, [Obama has made some important moves, including investing
billions in clean energy, jacking up vehicle-efficiency standards and
proposing rules to limit pollution]{.underline} from U.S. coal plants.
**[But climate change is a global issue. Unless the West can persuade
other countries to take climate action seriously, nothing any single
nation does is going to matter much when it comes to solving the
problem.]{.underline}**

[Except]{.underline}, that is, [for China.]{.underline} The blunt truth
is that **[what China decides to do in the next decade will likely
determine whether or not]{.underline}** ~~mankind~~ **[humanity can halt
-- or at least ameliorate -- global warming.]{.underline}** [The view
among]{.underline} a number of [prominent climate scientists is that if
China\'s emissions peak around 2025, we may]{.underline} -- **[just
barely]{.underline}** -- **[have a shot at stabilizing the climate
before all hell breaks loose. But the Chinese have resisted
international pressure to curb]{.underline}** their
**[emissions.]{.underline}** For years, they have used the argument that
they are poor, the West is rich, and that the high levels of carbon in
the atmosphere were caused by America\'s and Europe\'s 200-year-long
fossil­fuel binge. Climate change is your problem, they argued -- you
deal with it. But that logic doesn\'t hold anymore. [China is set to
become the largest economy in the world]{.underline} this year,
[and]{.underline} in 2006, [it passed the U.S. as the planet\'s largest
carbon polluter. China now dumps 10 billion tons of CO2 into the
atmosphere every year.]{.underline} **[That number is expected to grow
to 15 billion tons by 2030]{.underline}**, ~~dwarfing~~ the pollution of
the rest of the world. If that happens, then **[the chances that the
world will cut carbon pollution quickly enough to avert dangerous
climate change is]{.underline}**, according to Kevin Anderson, deputy
director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research in the U.K.,
**[\"virtually zero.\"]{.underline}**

John Kerry knows this. He also knows that [when the nations of the world
gather in Paris next December to try to hammer out a global climate
agreement]{.underline}, **[it may be the last best chance to address
this problem]{.underline}** before the Years of Living Dangerously
begin. Like other climate negotiations held under the banner of the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, [the Paris
meeting is likely to be warped by 25-year-old grudges and a profound
sense of distrust. \"But right now, Paris is the only game we
have]{.underline},\" one member of the State Department\'s climate team
told me. \"If it fails, there is no Plan B.\"

In Beijing, one of Kerry\'s goals will be to find out all he can about
China\'s strategy for Paris -- what kind of commitment the Chinese might
make, how sincere they are, what tactics they will use. But for Kerry,
**[this]{.underline}** is anything but a straightforward
**[conversation]{.underline}**, because **[it\'s twisted up in the
shadow play of U.S.-China relations, which are marked by
suspicion]{.underline}**, paranoia **[and saber rattling]{.underline}**
on both sides as the U.S. adjusts to China\'s rising power in the world.
\"What we are living through now is the end of 500 years of Western
predominance,\" historian Niall Ferguson has written. The issue is not
whether China will challenge America\'s dominance, but when and how.

In the Online Journal of Space Communication, Dr. Feng [Hsu, a NASA
scientist]{.underline} at Goddard Space Flight Center, a research center
[in the **forefront of science of space and Earth,**]{.underline}
[writes]{.underline}, "The [evidence of global warming is
alarming]{.underline}," noting [the potential for a catastrophic
planetary climate change is real]{.underline} and troubling (Hsu 2010).
Hsu and his NASA colleagues were engaged in monitoring and analyzing
cli- mate changes on a global scale, through which they received
first-hand scientific information and data relating to global warming
issues, including the dynamics of polar ice cap melting. [After
discussing this research with colleagues who were world experts on the
subject, he wrote]{.underline}: **[I now have no doubt global
temperatures are rising, and that global warming is a serious problem
confronting all of humanity]{.underline}**. No matter whether these
trends are due to human interference or to the cosmic cycling of our
solar system, there are two basic facts that are crystal clear: (a)
[there is overwhelming scientific evidence showing positive correlations
between the level of CO2 concentrations in Earth's atmosphere with
respect to the historical fluctuations of global temperature
changes]{.underline}; [and]{.underline} (b) **[the overwhelming
majority]{.underline}** [of the world's scientific community is in
agreement about the risks of a potential catastrophic global climate
change]{.underline}. That is, [if we humans continue to ignore this
problem]{.underline} and do noth- ing, if we continue dumping huge
quantities of greenhouse gases into Earth's biosphere, **[humanity will
be at dire risk]{.underline}** (Hsu 2010). [As a technology risk
assessment expert]{.underline}, [Hsu]{.underline} says he [can show with
some confi- dence that **the planet will face more risk doing nothing**
to curb its fossil-based energy addictions than it will in making a
fundamental shift in its energy supply]{.underline}. "This," he writes,
"is because [the risks of a catastrophic anthropogenic climate change
can be potentially **the extinction of human species**]{.underline}, a
risk [that is simply too high for us to take any chances]{.underline}"
(Hsu 2010). It was this NASA scientist's conclusion that humankind must
now embark on the next era of "sustainable energy consumption and
re-supply, the most obvious source of which is the mighty energy
resource of our Sun" (Hsu 2010) (Fig. 2.1).

#### U.S.-China conflict is inevitable without the counterplan---Key to cooperation spiral

**[Goldstein]{.underline}**, associate professor and founding director,
China Maritime Studies Institute, U.S. Naval War College, May
**[2015]{.underline}**

(Lyle, *Meeting China Halfway*, pg. 330-333)

[US-China relations remain mired in suspicion]{.underline} regrettably.
[While any forward progress is welcome]{.underline}, of course, [the
steps cited]{.underline} above [are mostly symbolic]{.underline},
representing, for the most part, [repackaging of longheld policies
rather than **genuine negotiated compromises**]{.underline}. The
measures emerging from [the late 2014 summit will]{.underline}
unfortunately [not stabilize the relationship over the long
term]{.underline}, nor provide definitive solutions to the most grave
issues confronting the relationship and global security more generally.
[These measures]{.underline} may simply move the relationship from
deeply fraught to extremely tense and [will do little to
break]{.underline} down [the veritable chasm of strategic mistrust that
presently divides Washington and Beijing]{.underline}. In the strategic
realm, since 2011 Washington has embarked on a "rebalancing to the
Asia-Pacific," while Beijing seems ever more determined to press its
maritime claims and simultaneously believes that the United States is
determined to contain and stifle China's rise. Most troubling of all,
[the military establishments in both the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates and [China each appears to]{.underline} hold that
they must earnestly [prepare for]{.underline} rivalry and even **[direct
conflict]{.underline}**.

Although, for the moment, the relationship is still guided by
pragmatists, [there is no denying a certain intense
loathing]{.underline}--- extant in the larger body politic, but also
felt intensely among political elites and bureaucrats in the corridors
of power. This hostility was born of historical enmity, cultural
divergence, and above all ideological estrangement. [When geopolitical
rivalry]{.underline}, undergirded by the "natural laws" of realism, [is
added to this volatile mix]{.underline}, [conflict between the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and China may appear to be
dauntingly overdetermined]{.underline}.

[The shadows of]{.underline} mistakes made a hundred years ago before
[World War I]{.underline} should [inform our]{.underline} sober
[deliberations]{.underline} today. Responsible scholars, strategists,
and [policymakers]{.underline} on both sides of the Pacific [must
endeavor to reduce US-China tensions]{.underline}, [lest this
relationship repeat the tragedy of great power politics]{.underline},
[with **devastating consequences**]{.underline}. This book is part of
such an effort, and thus it seeks to chart a viable path of partnership
through the implementation of "cooperation spirals" that will provide
concrete policy benefits to both sides and to the world community more
generally, and thus provide the substantive framework for "new great
power relations," a term that should be embraced and not rejected by
Washington as explained in chapter 1. [The]{.underline} gradual and
[**reciprocal nature** of]{.underline} the [cooperation spirals suggests
that the]{.underline} process itself, or "[model]{.underline},"
[is]{.underline} so self-evident and [intuitive]{.underline} as part of
basic human interaction that it does not require extensive theoretical
elaboration. But the impulse toward compromise or mutual accommodation
that the cooperation spirals embody is informed by Kissinger's wise
observation that neither China nor the United States is any longer
sufficiently strong to impose solutions upon the other. Yet neither
superpower is well practiced in the difficult process of negotiating
compromises with an equal. 1

The essence of the argument made in this book is that [China
must]{.underline} make a comprehensive effort to increase the
transparency of its national security apparatus, [**reform some of its
long-held claim**s]{.underline}, and influence certain partners to
conform to international norms. In a series of deescalatory steps, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should **reciprocate by
limiting the scope of its military deployments**]{.underline} and
military engagement activities, particularly but not only in the
Asia-Pacific region. Together with its still-extant military
superiority, a thorough acquaintance with the deeper history of US-China
relations (chapter 2) should enable and inspire Washington to lead in
initiating a series of cooperation cycles. After all, it was American
ships that patrolled the Yangtze River for nearly a century after 1854
and not Chinese ships patrolling the Mississippi River. The
transformative nature of Taiwan-- Mainland interactions since 2008
(chapter 3) provides an extraordinary opportunity to demonstrate the
promise of the cooperation cycle and break this Gordian knot that has
long impeded enhanced US-China cooperation. Economic relations (chapter
4) provide vital ballast for the relationship and have yielded
remarkable benefits to both societies, while environmental cooperation
(chapter 5) is now extremely promising and will likely take center stage
in future relations as the world community grapples with the impending
challenge of climate change. A proposal is made suggesting that
Washington accept a per capita emissions standard if China will agree to
join a climate change treaty with intrusive verification procedures. In
the developing world (chapter 6), it is suggested that if Beijing were
more transparent in its aid, financial, and arms trade transactions,
Washington would likely agree to embrace China's coleadership--- for
example, in leading key institutions such as the World Bank.

To rectify American security policy toward China, [the United States
needs]{.underline} [to return to its traditional policy goal of
preventing any foreign power]{.underline} 9781441147899_txt_print.indd 7
26/09/2012 14:17 Introduction 7 [from exercising regional dominance in
the Asia Pacific. This policy serve]{.underline}d [America well for over
a century and underpinned broad]{.underline} U.S. [resistance
to]{.underline} Japanese [aggression]{.underline} across the Pacific
during World War II. The U.S. has never sought undisputed geopolitical
primacy (or "[hegemony]{.underline}" as some call it) in Asia; this
position [was thrust upon the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[by the]{.underline} surrender of Japan and the [ensuing power vacuum in
the region. Looking to the]{.underline} [future, the U.S. needs to
embrace the view that while it will not allow Chin]{.underline}a [to
assert dominance in Asia]{.underline}, neither does America seek to
maintain its own dominance in the region as a security objective either.
[Adopting this view]{.underline} [will allow the United States to best
realize peace and stability in East Asi]{.underline}a for the indefinite
future. Regarding economic relations with China, the U.S. would be much
better off explicitly taking the position that eliminating remaining
trade barriers would unleash far greater trade and investment between
the two countries, a result that would be in the best interests of the
United States. Participating robustly in China's economic development,
exporting extensively to the Chinese market, investing in China's
manufacturing sector and infrastructure, and encouraging Chinese
investment in the United States will significantly increase American
prosperity. Protectionist sentiments should not be allowed to heavily
influence U.S. economic policy toward China. The U.S. should instead
encourage extensive American investment in China as well as billions of
dollars of direct foreign investment in the United States by Chinese
companies. Doing so will create a large number of American jobs, reduce
production costs for U.S. companies and prices for American consumers,
and spur the development of innovative products. The best way for the
United States to encourage greater democracy and human rights practices
in China is to improve U.S.-China relations by resolving outstanding
security issues, and in so doing protect Taiwan's democratic system for
the long term. Friendly relations will sharply undercut the ability of
China's Communist Party to justify internal repression on security
grounds. The Party would lose what former Soviet dissident Natan
Sharansky calls "its most dependable weapon in the struggle for
unassailable domination---an external threat . . . that can unify the
people and justify draconian security measures at home." 5 With the
"U.S. threat" gone, the regime would no longer be able to argue that
internal dissent weakens China's ability to confront an attack by the
United States. And in the absence of ongoing tension with the U.S. on
security issues, Chinese people seeking democracy and human rights could
far more openly express support for a multiparty system and indeed, the
political practices followed in America, Taiwan and Hong Kong.

new paradigm for u.s.-China relations [Achieving the major security,
economic and political benefits of improve]{.underline}d U.S.-China
[relations is not a small task. It will require a fundamental
shift]{.underline} [in U.S. policy and]{.underline} an effort by [both
countries to build the foundation for a "stable peace" by establishing a
new paradigm for their relations]{.underline}. A [stable
peace]{.underline} between the United States and China [would be
characterized]{.underline} [by coexistence and greater
cooperation]{.underline}. [It can be realized by pursuing]{.underline}
[rapprochement]{.underline} with China [through a process of
**reciprocal restraint**]{.underline}, [where]{.underline} [each country
practices accommodation and expects reciprocal actions]{.underline} in
return. The principles and goals to guide this process are best embodied
in [a Framework Agreement]{.underline} which [would create a new
diplomatic architecture]{.underline} [between the two countries,
strengthening stability and enhancing prosperit]{.underline}y [in the
Asia Pacific for generations]{.underline} to come. [As the dominant
country in the Asia Pacific, the United States]{.underline} now faces a
crucial strategic choice: it [can use its superior diplomatic,
economic]{.underline} [and political power to seek a stable peace with
China by achieving]{.underline} a [new paradigm for]{.underline}
U.S.-China [relations. Or]{.underline}, on the contrary, the U.S. can
[narrowly focus on]{.underline} protecting its domestic markets from
Chinese business and [building up its military presence in East Asia in
the expectation of an inevitable armed conflict with China.]{.underline}
Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger clearly sums up the risks of
future conflict between the U.S. and China in his 2011 history and
memoir, On China. Kissinger writes: [I am aware of the realistic
obstacles to the cooperative]{.underline} U.S.-China [relationship I
consider essential to global stability]{.underline} and peace. [A cold
war]{.underline} [between the two countries]{.underline} would arrest
progress for a generation on both sides of the Pacific. It [would spread
disputes into internal politics]{.underline} [of every region at a time
when]{.underline} global issues such as [nuclear
proliferation]{.underline}, [the environment, energy security, and
climate change impose]{.underline} g[lobal]{.underline}
[cooperation]{.underline}.6 To China hawks and protectionists who tend
to approach the future fearfully, a U.S. policy toward China of the kind
proposed here---based on reciprocal restraint and enlightened
self-interest---may seem objectionable. But [a policy which relies on
American power to facilitate a long-lasting framework for peaceful and
prosperous relations with China would]{.underline} best
[advance]{.underline} the [interests]{.underline} of the great majority
of Americans, now and in the future. 9781441147899_txt_print.indd 240
26/09/2012 14:17 Epilogue To fully appreciate the importance to the
United States of good relations with China, it is worth recalling the
wise words spoken by American presidents and senior foreign policy
officials during the last 40 years. President richard m. nixon February
1972 The Chinese people are a great people, the American people are a
great people. If our two peoples are enemies, the future of this world
we share together is dark indeed. But if we can find common ground to
work together, the chance for world peace is immeasurably increased . .
. . So let us . . . start a long march together, not in lockstep, but on
different roads leading to the same goal, the goal of building a world
structure of peace and justice in which all may stand together with
equal dignity and in which each nation, large or small, has a right to
determine its own form of government, free of outside interference or
domination. The world watches. The world listens. The world waits to see
what we will do . . . . There is no reason for us to be enemies. Neither
of us seeks the territory of the other; neither of us seeks domination
over the other; neither of us seeks to stretch out our hands and rule
the world.1 President Jimmy Carter December 1978 The United States of
America and the People's Republic of China have agreed to recognize each
other and to establish diplomatic relations as of January 1, 1979 . . .
. As a nation of gifted people who comprise about

one-fourth of the total population of the Earth, China plays, already,
an important role in world affairs, a role that can only grow more
important in the years ahead . . . . The change that I'm announcing
tonight will be of great long-term benefit to the peoples of both our
country and China--- and, I believe, to all the peoples of the world.
Normalization---and the expanded commercial and cultural relations that
it will bring---will contribute to the well-being of our own Nation, to
our own national interest, and it will also enhance the stability of
Asia . . . . These events are the final result of long and serious
negotiations begun by President Nixon in 1972, and continued under the
leadership of President Ford. The results bear witness to the steady,
determined, bipartisan effort of our country to build a world in which
peace will be the goal and the responsibility of all nations.2 President
ronald reagan April 1984 We have begun to write a new chapter for peace
and progress in our histories with America and China going forward hand
in hand . . . . We must always be realistic about our relationship,
frankly acknowledging the fundamental differences in ideology and
institutions between our two societies. Yes, let us acknowledge those
differences. Let us never minimize them. But let us not be dominated by
them. I have not come to China to hold forth on what divides us, but to
build on what binds us. I have not come to dwell on a closed-door past,
but to urge that Americans and Chinese look to the future, because
together we can and will make tomorrow a better day . . . . We can work
together as equals in a spirit of mutual respect and mutual benefit . .
. . America and China are both great nations. And we have a special
responsibility to preserve world peace.3 President William j. Clinton
June 1998 Some Americans believe we should try to isolate and contain
China because of its undemocratic system and human rights violations,
and in order to retard its capacity to become America's next great enemy

Seeking to isolate China is clearly unworkable . . . . \[[Choosing\]
isolation]{.underline} [over engagement would not make the world safer.
It would make it]{.underline} m[ore]{.underline} [dangerous. It would
undermine]{.underline} rather than strengthen our efforts to foster
[stability in Asia. It would eliminate]{.underline}, not facilitate
[cooperation on]{.underline} issues relating to [weapons of mass
destruction]{.underline}. It would [hinder]{.underline}, not help the
cause of [democracy and human rights in China]{.underline}. It would
[set back]{.underline}, not step up [worldwide efforts to protect the
environment]{.underline}. It would [cut off]{.underline}, not open up
one of [the world's most important markets]{.underline}. It would
[encourage the Chinese]{.underline} [to turn inward and to act in
opposition to our interests]{.underline} and values. 4 Former national
security advisor Samuel R. Berger January 2001 \[A\] principle that
guides our foreign policy in a global age is that peace
[and]{.underline} security for America depends on building [principled,
constructive]{.underline} relations with our former great power
adversaries, Russia and China . . . . With China, our challenge has been
to steer between the extremes of uncritical engagement and untenable
confrontation. That balance has helped [maintain peace in the Taiwan
Straits, secured China's help]{.underline} in maintaining stability [on
the Korean Peninsula]{.underline}, and allowed us to negotiate an
historic agreement to bring it into the World Trade Organization. \[The
WTO Agreement\] . . . represents the most constructive breakthrough in
U.S.-China relations since normalization in 1979. For China, it is a
declaration of interdependence, and a commitment to start dismantling
the command and control economy through which the Communist Party
exercises much of its power. 5 Former national security advisor Brent
Scowcroft September 2006 \[W\]e've had seven presidents reaffirm the
general direction of our relations with China, but they didn't all start
out that way . . . . \[Tiananmen Square\] was a serious crisis in the
relationship. We had to 9781441147899_txt_print.indd 243 26/09/2012
14:17 Epilogue 243 respond. It was an outrageous act . . . . President
\[George H. W.\] Bush felt he had to respond but he did not want to
sever this relationship which had been gradually built up and gradually
deepened . . . . \[T\]here have been some really, really rough spots in
this relationship. But I think the fact that it has endured shows that
it is deeply important both to the United States and China, and it will
not survive any blows that either side can strike at it but it's strong
enough to endure most of them. So I'm proudly optimistic for the
future.6 Former secretary of state james baker March 2011 Allow me to be
blunt. Some in the United States---not a majority by any means, but
certainly a vocal minority---see China's rise as a threat somehow to
America's international status. They believe that conflict between our
two countries is inevitable as Chinese ambitions clash with American
position and power. Ladies and gentlemen, these observers are wrong. And
they are not only wrong, they are dangerously wrong. And the reason is
very simple---their analyses grossly underestimate the broad areas where
Chinese and American interests converge.7 Former secretary of the
Treasury Henry Paulson, jr. April 2011 There's no doubt in my mind that
. . . the more cross border investment we have, the more US investment
in China and the more Chinese investment in US, the stronger the
relations will be between the two countries . . . . And as I look at
fundamental problems \[the United States is\] dealing with, whether they
are the economic problem globally, whether they're national security,
whether the environment, \[I believe\] that these issues will be easier
to solve if you get the biggest developed nation and the biggest
developing nation working well together and with others, and \[those
problems will\] be impossible to solve if we don't work

. . . . \[W\]hat we're going to find is that a prosperous growing Asia
is going to be very good for the US, and a prosperous US is going to be
good for Asia . . . . \[T\]he more engagement you have, the more
investment you have . . . \[and\] then when the inevitable difficulties
take place, or \[political conflicts occur\], in Washington or Beijing,
it would be easier to bridge those, the more ties we have between our
two countries.8 Former secretary of state Henry Kissinger May 2011 In
his essay 'Perpetual Peace,' the philosopher Immanuel Kant argued that
perpetual peace would eventually come to the world in one of two ways:
by human insight or by conflicts and catastrophes of a magnitude that
left humanity no other choice. We are at such a juncture. When Premier
Zhou Enlai and I agreed on the communiqué that announced the secret
visit, he said: "This will shake the world." What a culmination if,
forty years later, the United States and China could merge their efforts
not to shake the world, but to build it.9 Former national security
advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski January 2012 [The]{.underline} United
States' [central challenge]{.underline} over the next several decades
[is to]{.underline} revitalize itself, while promoting a larger West and
buttressing a complex balance in the East that can
[accommodate]{.underline} China's rising global status . . . . [If the
United States and China can accommodate each other on a]{.underline}
[broad range of issues, the prospects for stability]{.underline} [in
Asia]{.underline} [will be greatly]{.underline} [increased]{.underline}
. . . . \[The\] United States must recognize that
[stability]{.underline} in Asia [can no longer be imposed by a non-Asian
power, least of all by]{.underline} the [direct]{.underline} application
of U.S. [military power]{.underline}. Indeed, [U.S. efforts]{.underline}
to buttress Asian stability [could prove self-defeating,
propelling]{.underline} Washington into a [costly]{.underline} repeat of
its recent [wars]{.underline}, potentially even resulting [in a replay
of]{.underline} the tragic events of [Europe in the twentieth
century]{.underline}.10

**[Fredman 15]{.underline}** \[Zachary Fredman (Boren Teaching
Fellow---Boston University, former Mellon Fellow in American History at
Cambridge) on Goldstein, \'Meeting China Halfway: How to Defuse the
Emerging US-China Rivalry\', September 2015,
https://networks.h-net.org/node/28443/reviews/80851/fredman-goldstein-meeting-china-halfway-how-defuse-emerging-us-china\]

In addressing economic relations, Goldstein points out that [economic
interdependence does not preclude conflict. America was Japan's leading
trade partner in the years before Pearl Harbor, and Europe enjoyed a
high degree of economic interdependence leading up to World War I.
Despite high levels of trade]{.underline}, economic [tensions between
Washington and Beijing have increased]{.underline} over the last decade.
[But]{.underline} success stories like Boeing Corporation's
extraordinary role in improving China's civil air safety record from the
1990s to the present, while also increasing its market share, have
demonstrated how [closer collaboration can yield win-win results on a
massive scale.]{.underline} Beginning with reciprocal steps to decrease
barriers to the purchase of US companies and encourage major investment
in the US economy, [Goldstein seeks to lay the groundwork for improved
economic relations]{.underline} [that will]{.underline} eventually lead
to Washington easing restrictions on high-technology transfers to China
and [see Beijing]{.underline} allow [free float]{.underline} for [the
Renminbi]{.underline}.

[When it comes to environmental issues]{.underline} and relations with
the developing world, [Goldstein sees many opportunities for closer
cooperation]{.underline}. Public opinion [in]{.underline} both countries
shows increasing awareness of the dangers of [global
warming]{.underline}. [The November 2014 bilateral climate accord
demonstrates that key Chinese and American policymakers recognize the
enormous stakes]{.underline}. [Goldstein's cooperation
spiral]{.underline} on the environment and climate change lays out ten
policy proposals [lead]{.underline}ing [toward mutual acceptance of a
**global climate change treaty**]{.underline}. Goldstein also addresses
environmental concerns when discussing the developing world and US-China
relations, but he is most keen on formulating policy proposals that can
prevent Cold War-style geopolitical competition in Africa and Latin
America. Chinese thinkers show little appetite for a militarized
approach to Africa, and Goldstein argues that Washington should shutter
the Pentagon's Africa Command (AFRICOM).

In the Middle East, meanwhile, Goldstein believes that [closer
cooperation between the United States and China could facilitate
improved ties between Tehran and Washington]{.underline}. [The
cooperation spiral]{.underline} he outlines in this chapter is
particularly ambitious, with its final steps [call]{.underline}ing
[for]{.underline} the United States to pressure Israel into giving up
its nuclear weapons and [China to use its influence to pressure Iran
into recognizing Israel and initiating bilateral ties]{.underline}.
Goldstein concedes that this cooperation spiral has a low probability of
success. Yet [both China and the United States have an interest in
stabilizing the Middle East, and US ambitions to transform the region
with military power have met with repeated failure. China's
rise]{.underline} as a global power, Goldstein concludes, [could help to
rebalance the structure of power in the region. Acting in
concert]{.underline} with other great powers, especially [China, could
help the United States in building a more stable, just, and prosperous
Middle East.]{.underline}

### \--xt coop k2 warming

That cooperation is [necessary]{.underline} and [sufficient]{.underline}
to solve global warming

Gao Hairan, Deputy Director and Assistant Professor, National Center for
Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation (NCSC), focuses on
China-U.S. relations on climate change and South-South cooperation on
climate change, The Fletcher Forum of World Affairs, March 17, 2014,
"How China and the United States Can Work Together to Tackle Global
Climate Change", http://www.fletcherforum.org/2014/03/17/hairan/

**[Climate change is one of the most severe]{.underline}** environmental
and socioeconomic **[challenges faced]{.underline}** by human beings
**[today.]{.underline}** [It is]{.underline} also a key issue of
sustainable development and **[closely related to
biodiversity]{.underline}**, **[poverty alleviation]{.underline}**, and
the transformation to a low-carbon development path. [As the world's
largest economies and emitters of greenhouse gas emissions]{.underline},
**[China and the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[must
work together]{.underline}** more **[cooperatively]{.underline}** and
with other countries **[to combat climate change and to help the globe
build a low-carbon future.]{.underline}**

[Anthropogenic GHGs emissions have had a huge impact on global warming
since the Industrial Revolution.]{.underline} As such, **[curbing global
climate change requires]{.underline}** coordinated and **[coherent
global action]{.underline}**, as well as an overarching system that
includes all major greenhouse gas emitters (GHGs) in the world. The
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its
Kyoto Protocol have been the cornerstone of international cooperation on
tackling climate change since the 1990s.

[Still, major political differences remain between developed and
developing countries.]{.underline} Developed countries believe that the
current international climate framework should evolve over time and be
dynamic enough to reflect economic and geopolitical changes. Developing
countries, on the other hand, insist that developed countries should
continue to take the lead in GHGs emission reduction beyond 2020, and
developing countries should make efforts to cut their GHGs emissions
according to their capabilities. Furthermore, from the developing
countries' perspective, abandoning the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol and
redefining the principle of common but different responsibilities (CBDR)
is not acceptable.

[The current international]{.underline} political [dilemma]{.underline}
on combating climate change [is twofold: first, how should we allocate
valuable and limited GHGs emission space to various
countries?]{.underline} And [second, is this burden-sharing best
accomplished through a top-down or a bottom-up approach?]{.underline}
The former might accomplish this through an international,
legally-binding agreement such as the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol, and
the latter through nationally determined, voluntary actions that may be
related but not limited to countries' QELROs, renewable energy
development targets, poverty alleviation, and energy intensity.

[Therefore, finding a common denominator is crucial to mobilizing global
consensus and action to curb climate change.]{.underline} As
negotiations continue, one possibility in 2015 would be a general
agreement that combines both the top-down and bottom-up approaches. This
could be facilitated through a robust international measurable,
reportable, and verifiable (MRV) system with common accounting rules to
ensure transparency and real emissions reductions by countries involved
without undermining their long-term socioeconomic development or
infringing upon national sovereignty. In addition, enhancing financial,
technological, and capacity building support will also be key elements
of any agreement, as they are of significant importance to help
developing countries address climate change.

**[As the two top GHGs emitters, economies, and energy users in the
world, the actions taken by China and the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[are crucial to the realization of the
ultimate objective of the UNFCCC and sustainable development on a global
scale.]{.underline}** [In 2013, the total fossil CO2 emissions of China
and the United States accounted for]{.underline} **[more than forty
percent of world fossil CO2 emissions.]{.underline}** Therefore, **[any
successful effort to tackle climate change will need these two countries
to work towards a solution]{.underline}** either through the UNFCCC
process or on a bilateral basis. Meanwhile, it also must be noted that
China is different from the United States in various aspects, and should
thus bear different responsibilities in tackling climate change.
Recognizing the differences between the two countries politically will
be helpful for effectively managing those differences, building a
constructive partnership, and finding mutually acceptable approaches to
cooperation without undermining their respective core national
climate-related interests.

[Cooperation]{.underline} between China and the United States under the
UNFCCC [could ensure a successful 2015 global pact on climate change and
further solidify bilateral cooperation]{.underline} under the current
China-U.S. Climate Change Working Group (CCWG). As for the UNFCCC
process, both countries should demonstrate their political willingness
and commitment to it for the protection of climate as a global public
good. In terms of bilateral cooperation, issues of common interest may
include short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs), shale gas, HFCs, nuclear
technology, and the five thematic areas under the CCWG. The two
countries must recognize that combating climate change, either through a
UN-led multilateral process or on a bilateral basis, is of mutual
interest to them, both economically and strategically.

By working together, China and the United States may also find new
domestic opportunities, such as economic restructuring and rebalancing
investment, finance, and trade between them. This could also help ensure
energy security and economic prosperity while moving towards a
low-carbon development path. [China-U.S. cooperation on climate may also
contribute to building new models of major power relations between them
and mobilizing global political momentum.]{.underline} In this
connection, regular, open, and targeted exchange, dialogue and
negotiation mechanisms on climate and energy should be further explored
and utilized to improve mutual understanding.

At its most basic, a grand bargain between two states may be understood
in a contractual fashion: it consists of a bundle of agreements by which
state X gives up something of significant strategic value to itself in
exchange for state Y committing to something that is of equal or greater
strategic value. The overall purpose would be to bring about more
clarity and predictability vis-à-vis their goals and interactions. 4

compared to power transition, see Evelyn Goh, 'The US--China
relationship and Asia-Pacific security: Negotiating change', Asian
Security, 1, no. 3, 2005, pp. 216--44. New Directions in Strategic
Thinking 2.0 54 [A 'grand bargain' is based on the notion that
coexistence among states]{.underline} (and especially major powers) [is
built upon reciprocal commitments, or fundamental political compromises,
which allow some form of strategic exchange and interdependence to
develop. Between great powers, grand bargains in their most advanced
form must entail some form of negotiated constraints to their exercise
of power]{.underline}. Grand bargains basically involve implicit or
explicit agreement about the mutually acceptable terms on which peaceful
relations can be conducted. These include understandings about
recognition and status, mutual rights and responsibilities, mutual
spheres of influence, terms of exchange and conditions of restraint. [It
is on this basis that scholars sometimes argue that the United States
and China, or China and Japan, will need to negotiate a grand bargain
between themselves and even with other key states in East Asia for
regional security and stability to prevail]{.underline}.6 In general,
the big advantage of a 'bargain' approach to understanding and
influencing great power relations is its innate relationality: [the
reciprocal and transactional assumptions underpinning bargains obliges
us to examine and try to reconcile the preferences, goals and tactics of
each of the parties involved. This sits in contrast to the one-sided
notions of containment or appeasement that often seem to dominate
debates about how to respond to China's rise]{.underline}, for example.
Thinking about bargains involves taking seriously what the other side
wants and values. [Moreover, a grand bargain approach helps us to grasp
the complexity of international orders. On the one hand, it connotes
linkage across issue areas]{.underline} (as Glaser suggests). [But it
also crucially entails a systemic perspective beyond bilateral
relationships]{.underline}; for instance, a grand bargain lens should
additionally allow us to probe the broader regional and historical
contexts that clearly affect the attractiveness, viability and scope of
any putative new US--China bargain. 6 See Evelyn Goh, 'Japan, China, and
the Great Power bargain in East Asia', East Asia Institute Fellows

bargain' in East Asia From such a starting point, we may identify at
least two issues critical to the possibility of a grand bargain in
contemporary East Asia: the effects of existing strategic bargains, and
Chinese notions of the acceptable terms for a bargain with the United
States. Both these issues affect how desirable proposals for grand
bargains like White's and Glaser's might be from the points of view of
China and crucial US allies in the region. Strategic bargains in the
status quo ante Strategic bargains form the sinews of international
order, and while they are most likely to be struck at critical junctures
such as following crises or wars, once struck they do not simply
disappear but continue to evolve and might be renegotiated. As such,
anything we may propose in the contemporary setting would in fact be a
new grand bargain between the United States and China. It would not be
created from scratch, because the status quo ante is already marked by a
series of 'grand', regional, trilateral and bilateral bargains. This is
a fundamentally important point---**it shows that Washington and
Beijing** (and other East Asian states, for that matter) **have been and
are capable of striking bargains**]{.underline}.

Taiwan has always been a "chess piece"
that [Washington](https://www.cnbc.com/washington/) can play with in
U.S.-China relations**]{.underline}, [said Zhiqun Zhu, a professor of
political science and international relations at Bucknell
University]{.underline}. "**[Taiwan's value to the U.S. will only
increase as tensions between the U.S. and China
escalate]{.underline}**," [Zhu told CNBC. Under the Chinese Communist
Party's "One China" policy, the self-ruled island is part of mainland
China]{.underline}. **[Chinese President [Xi
Jinping](https://www.cnbc.com/xi-jinping/) has said before that China
"must be and will be" reunified with Taiwan]{.underline}** --- by force
if necessary. However, recent military and diplomatic actions from
Washington have been seen by Beijing as U.S. support for Taiwan's
independence movement. At the Shangri-la dialogue defense summit
in [Singapore](https://www.cnbc.com/singapore/) last weekend, Chinese
Lieutenant General Shao Yuanming said Washington's support for Taipei
has sent "[terribly wrong signals to Taiwan's independence forces, which
could undermine regional peace and stability.
"](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3012732/chinese-general-tells-us-stop-using-taiwan-south-china-sea)"If
anyone wants to separate Taiwan from the country, the Chinese military
will resolutely defend the unity of our motherland at all costs," Shao
added. '**[Upgrade' in US-Taiwan relations The U.S. using Taiwan as a

any official meetings between the U.S. and Taiwan. ["I believe we're
inching closer & closer to Beijing's redline on US-Taiwan senior
official mtgs\--those that are publicized at least,"]{.underline} Derek
Grossman, a senior defense analyst at** **California-based** **think
tank Rand Corporation, said on Twitter after the U.S.-Taiwan meeting.
Grossman told CNBC on email that his understanding is that such meetings
"have been ongoing for some time in private." "My hunch is that it was
publicized this time via intentional leak from one or both sides to
signal to China that the upgrade in U.S.-Taiwan relations is here to
stay," he added.

#### No commitment problem -- but even if there is, the grand bargain itself solves any drawbacks

**[Glaser 15]{.underline}**

Charles L. Glaser, 2015, "A U.S.-China Grand Bargain? The Hard Choice
between Military Competition and Accommodation" *International
Security,* Vol. 39, No. 4,
https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/89b2/e47888332bf995595ef8d2d61fde0df5ca45.pdf

Affairs and the Department of Political Science at George Washington
University. He is also a fellow in the Kissinger Institute at the
Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.

[One could argue that a grand bargain is of little or no value because
China faces a commitment problem]{.underline}. According to this
argument, as China becomes more powerful, the costs of reneging on the
deal will decrease, making defection China's best option; recognizing
this danger in advance, the United States should be unwilling to enter
into a grand bargain. [More specifically, this argument holds that China
will eventually be much better able to reassert its claims in the South
China and East China Seas, and to pressure U.S. allies to cut their ties
to the United States]{.underline}, and therefore will pursue these more
aggressive policies; consequently, a grand bargain is no better for the
United States than are unilateral concessions. [This argument overstates
the commitment problem.]{.underline} Whether China faces a commitment
problem depends on its aims: [if China's aims are limited and would be
largely satisfied by U.S. accommodation, then China does not face a
commitment problem]{.underline}; increases in China's power would not
make breaking the agreement its best option. [The barrier from the U.S.
perspective is that China's aims are uncertain. Given this information
problem, the United States would find itself uncertain about whether
China faces a commitment problem.]{.underline} The more the United
States believes it likely that China's aims go well beyond the terms of
the grand bargain, the less attractive the grand bargain is as a
long-term policy designed to respond to China's growing power. If a
grand bargain brought only risks and China was likely to break out of
the bargain, then the United States should not pursue it. As I have
shown, however, [a grand bargain could bring a variety of benefits,
including providing information about China's aims, which would reduce
the likelihood of a commitment problem; communicating U.S. resolve to
protect American interests; and possibly contributing to a Chinese
domestic consensus on limited aims]{.underline}. In addition, as
explained above, [the United States should pursue policies that would
contribute to preserving the grand bargain and reducing the costs if it
fails, including maintaining military capabilities sufficient to protect
its allies, which should help convince China that breaking the agreement
would harm its interests. Because neither the ability of the United
States to protect its allies nor its credibility for doing so would be
significantly diminished by the grand bargain or its unraveling, and
because China's goals could well be sufficiently limited that the United
States does not actually face a commitment problem, the grand bargain
has good prospects for increasing U.S. security.]{.underline}

[**China's willingness to reach an agreement**]{.underline} on the
offshore islands and related maritime disputes [would provide the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [with valuable
information]{.underline}. Most obviously, [it would demonstrate that

given that the value of Taiwan dwarfs the value of these maritime
disputes, [**Chinese unwillingness to reach this type of bargain** would
**indicate deep inflexibility** in its emerging foreign policy

achieve]{.underline} all of [its aims]{.underline}. China's claims in
these disputes are also weaker than its claims to Taiwan: for example,
China did not claim the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands until 1970, which
suggests that it should be able to moderate this claim if the benefits
were sufficiently large. In addition, an agreement would provide the
United States with insights into the balance of power within China's
foreign policy decisionmaking. [If China's more assertive policies have
reflected the growing influence of]{.underline} the People's Liberation
Army, [narrow nationalist pressures]{.underline}, or both, then
[**Chinese concessions would demonstrate** that the country's leaders
could control these forces **when the stakes are sufficiently

goals would make U.S. accommodation over Taiwan less risky.

China Maritime Studies Institute, U.S. Naval War College, May
**[2015]{.underline}**

(Lyle, *Meeting China Halfway*, pg. 63)

Beijing's move 2 on Taiwan: [China should remove its short-range
ballistic and cruise missiles from within a radius of 1,000 kilometers
from Taiwan]{.underline}. Mainland China's short-range missile forces
are often cited as the most severe threat that the PLA wields against
Taiwan. Indeed, such missiles were tested during the 1996 crisis, and
their numbers have grown considerably since then. **[Like the sword of
Damocles]{.underline}**, [these weapons threaten not only]{.underline}
"[shock and awe]{.underline}" [but also the possibility of knocking out
Taiwan's air and naval forces in a devastating first
strike]{.underline}, not to mention the very real possibility of
decapitating Taiwan's military and/ or civilian leadership. Antimissile
defenses such as the Patriot are very far from adequate to the threat,
because those systems could quite easily be overwhelmed by the sheer
weight of large missile salvoes. Moreover, PLA cruise missiles are now
ranging around Taiwan in ever-increasing numbers and, though easier to
shoot down, the cumulative threat of greater numbers of weapons will
naturally be much higher. Confronting this very "clear and present
danger," [the citizens of Taiwan have naturally become
unnerved]{.underline}. [And this reaction has generally resulted in
**closer defense relations between Washington and
Taipei**]{.underline}--- quite [contrary to Beijing's
goals]{.underline}. Thus, [the Mainland will find it politically useful
to actually lay this potent capability aside]{.underline} for the time
being. [This is not]{.underline}--- at least at this early stage--- [a
pledge not to use force]{.underline}. Rather, [this is largely a
symbolic move]{.underline} (because the weapons could quickly be
redeployed closer to Taiwan) [for political effect]{.underline}, [aimed
at showing goodwill and increasing confidence across the Strait
and]{.underline} also [between Washington and Beijing on this
crucial]{.underline}, [contentious issue]{.underline}. 55

#### CP doesn't require China to [renounce its claim]{.underline} on Taiwan, just drawdown their missiles---[incremental and reciprocal steps]{.underline} circumvent their "CBM fails" arguments

**[Fredman 15]{.underline}** \[Zachary Fredman (Boren Teaching
Fellow---Boston University, former Mellon Fellow in American History at
Cambridge) on Goldstein, \'Meeting China Halfway: How to Defuse the
Emerging US-China Rivalry\', September 2015,
https://networks.h-net.org/node/28443/reviews/80851/fredman-goldstein-meeting-china-halfway-how-defuse-emerging-us-china\]

Lyle J. Goldstein's Meeting China Halfway is essential reading for
anyone interested in US foreign relations or contemporary China. A
senior China scholar at the Naval War College, Goldstein warns that the
potential for US-China military conflict has increased markedly in the
past ten years. Influential academics like Aaron Friedberg (A Contest
for Supremacy: China, America, and the Struggle for Mastery in Asia
\[2011\]) and John Mearsheimer (The Tragedy of Great Power Politics
\[2014\]) have urged US policymakers to abandon engagement and focus on
containment. The Barack Obama administration, Goldstein notes, has
largely endorsed the program advocated by those seeking to balance
China's rise. In China, meanwhile, discourse regarding the United States
has become more bellicose. Many high-ranking officials in China's
security and defense establishments see the United States as China's
greatest national security threat. [If the downward spiral
in]{.underline} US-China [relations]{.underline}
[continues]{.underline}, Goldstein argues, [the result will]{.underline}
likely [be a "repetition of the]{.underline} misery caused by the
[catastrophic wars]{.underline} and wasteful rivalries [of the twentieth
century]{.underline}" (p. 325). Drawing from a wide array of Chinese and
American sources, [Goldstein lays out a plan to enable the two powers to
step back from rivalry and move toward mutual
accommodation]{.underline}. From its position of strength, Washington
must take the lead and begin accommodating China's interests in Asia.
For America, Goldstein concludes, "[there is no viable alternative to
meeting China halfway]{.underline}" (p. 364).

Goldstein makes his case by taking Chinese voices seriously and
proposing ten "**[cooperation spirals]{.underline}**" that outline
step-by-step approaches for [resolv]{.underline}ing [the seemingly
intractable problems in US-China relations. Cooperation spirals build
trust and confidence over time through **incremental and reciprocal
steps**]{.underline} [that **gradually lead to** larger and more
significant compromises]{.underline}. In each chapter, Goldstein
explores a particular issue by examining its historical background,
analyzing numerous Chinese and American perspectives, and then laying
out a cooperation spiral composed of ten concrete policy
proposals---five for the United States and five for China. Goldstein's
analysis of Chinese scholarship reveals a wide range of opinion, even on
controversial issues like Taiwan. In a field where many writers are
quick to dismiss Chinese viewpoints as propaganda---if they bother to
examine them at all---Meeting China Halfway stands out as a model of
rigorous, even-handed scholarship.

[Chin]{.underline}a hawks and believers in American exceptionalism will
find many of Goldstein's ideas hard to swallow, but they would be wise
to read his book carefully. Far too much writing on China rests on
ideologically tinged assumptions that Beijing must institute
American-style political and economic reforms in order to stave off
social unrest or collapse. Goldstein has little sympathy for such views,
which reveal more about American anxieties than they do about China.
Confidence that [China will become much stronger over the coming
decades]{.underline}, and that its economy will soon surpass that of the
United States in size, undergirds his basic arguments. He also points
out that China has already moved ahead of the US military in certain
domains, such as anti-ship cruise missiles. [Yet just
because]{.underline} Goldstein believes [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [cannot hope to impose its will on China does not
mean]{.underline} he advocates [making concessions without asking
Beijing to adjust its current and long-held positions in
return]{.underline}. [Rather, Goldstein urges Washington to
demonstrate]{.underline} real [leadership]{.underline} and courage [in
making the first moves]{.underline}. The fact is, as he shows, [China's
perspective has been influenced by their view of a "century of
humiliation.]{.underline}" While the United States did not take the lead
in much of the Western imperialism that undermined Chinese sovereignty
in the century leading up to World War II, it still played a large role.
[Imagine if the Chinese Navy had patrolled the Mississippi River with
gunboats from the 1850s to the 1940s, as the US Navy did on China's
Yangtze River, and you can begin to understand why it is imperative that
Washington acts first]{.underline}.

[The Taiwan problem has long been a key irritant in US-China relations.
Goldstein's cooperation spiral]{.underline} for this issue rests on the
assumption that the United States cannot indefinitely maintain close
security ties with a claimed island off the coast of a nuclear-armed
superpower. He [urges Washington to create circumstances that
**promote**]{.underline} the [**settlement** of the Taiwan problem
rather than its perpetuation]{.underline}. Taiwan-Mainland
[integration]{.underline}, Goldstein argues, [will actually **strengthen
US alliances** with Japan and South Korea by preventing these countries
from being pulled by treaty commitments into a conflict over Taiwan.
Goldstein seeks a permanent solution by **beginning with smaller
moves**:]{.underline} **[reducing US forces]{.underline}** on Guam and
closing the military office at the American Institute in Taipei [while
Beijing instigates]{.underline} military [exchanges with Taiwan without
preconditions and **pulls missiles back**]{.underline} from East China.
[The cooperation spiral **culminates** with Washington halting weapons
sales to Taiwan, and Beijing renouncing the use of force and beginning a
peace treaty process that joins Taiwan and the Mainland in a
confederation]{.underline}. Goldstein concludes that [a breakthrough
on]{.underline} the [Taiwan]{.underline} problem [is "**imperative to
U.S.-China cooperation** in the twenty-first century"]{.underline} (p.
72).

In addressing economic relations, Goldstein points out that economic
interdependence does not preclude conflict. America was Japan's leading
trade partner in the years before Pearl Harbor, and Europe enjoyed a
high degree of economic interdependence leading up to World War I.
Despite high levels of trade, economic tensions between Washington and
Beijing have increased over the last decade. But success stories like
Boeing Corporation's extraordinary role in improving China's civil air
safety record from the 1990s to the present, while also increasing its
market share, have demonstrated how closer collaboration can yield
win-win results on a massive scale. Beginning with reciprocal steps to
decrease barriers to the purchase of US companies and encourage major
investment in the US economy, Goldstein seeks to lay the groundwork for
improved economic relations that will eventually lead to Washington
easing restrictions on high-technology transfers to China and see
Beijing allow free float for the Renminbi.

When it comes to environmental issues and relations with the developing
world, Goldstein sees many opportunities for closer cooperation. Public
opinion in both countries shows increasing awareness of the dangers of
global warming. The November 2014 bilateral climate accord demonstrates
that key Chinese and American policymakers recognize the enormous
stakes. Goldstein's cooperation spiral on the environment and climate
change lays out ten policy proposals leading toward mutual acceptance of
a global climate change treaty. Goldstein also addresses environmental
concerns when discussing the developing world and US-China relations,
but he is most keen on formulating policy proposals that can prevent
Cold War-style geopolitical competition in Africa and Latin America.
Chinese thinkers show little appetite for a militarized approach to
Africa, and Goldstein argues that Washington should shutter the
Pentagon's Africa Command (AFRICOM).

In the Middle East, meanwhile, Goldstein believes that closer
cooperation between the United States and China could facilitate
improved ties between Teheran and Washington. The cooperation spiral he
outlines in this chapter is particularly ambitious, with its final steps
calling for the United States to pressure Israel into giving up its
nuclear weapons and China to use its influence to pressure Iran into
recognizing Israel and initiating bilateral ties. Goldstein concedes
that this cooperation spiral has a low probability of success. Yet both
China and the United States have an interest in stabilizing the Middle
East, and US ambitions to transform the region with military power have
met with repeated failure. China's rise as a global power, Goldstein
concludes, could help to rebalance the structure of power in the region.
Acting in concert with other great powers, especially China, could help
the United States in building a more stable, just, and prosperous Middle
East.

On the Korean Peninsula, Goldstein makes the case for coequal Chinese
and American leadership in forging a durable peace. His analysis of
Chinese writing on Korea is enlightening. Chinese intellectuals see the
South Korean military and defense industries as models to emulate. They
do not view Seoul's evolving military posture as a threat. At the same
time, more and more Chinese analysts have called for a reevaluation of
Beijing's stance toward Pyongyang. Goldstein, however, actually
encourages Beijing to take steps that would enhance Pyongyang's
security, including a reinvigoration of the 1961 Sino-North Korean
Defense Treaty and a symbolic troop presence in North Korea. Given the
vast disparity of economic power and conventional military capabilities
on the peninsula, Pyongyang's anxieties are understandable. A token
Chinese military presence and stronger commitment to upholding security
and stability on the peninsula could preclude the need for North Korea
to take radical steps to demonstrate its will to fight. Further steps on
the cooperation spiral propose that Washington inaugurate diplomatic
relations with North Korea and withdraw a large number of troops from
South Korea while still maintaining its alliance with Seoul. China, for
its part, should oversee North Korea's complete and verified nuclear
disarmament. The most salient problem on the Korean Peninsula, Goldstein
concludes, is North Korea's stark vulnerability and insecurity. To
achieve disarmament, North Korea must first be made more secure, and
only "China has the means and incentive to aid in this endeavor" (p.
218).

Goldstein's approach to Japan is equally bold and creative. To a large
extent, he writes, the divisive issues between Tokyo and Beijing are
"imagined" (p. 226). Tokyo fears an immensely powerful and militaristic
China that could hypothetically threaten Japan's vital interests in the
future. Beijing's anxieties about a revival of Japanese militarism
ignore how cautiously and sparingly Japan has deployed its armed might
since 1945. Nevertheless, relations between China and Japan "have been
in a virtual death spiral since at least 2010, if not before" (p. 225).
China has legitimate historical grievances that Japan must address, and
Goldstein states that Washington must push Tokyo toward a "Willy Brandt"
solution involving reparations and a prime ministerial visit to the
Nanjing Massacre Museum. Other proposals in the cooperation spiral call
for a reduced US Marine Corps presence in Okinawa, joint administration
of the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, and a median line settlement in the East
China Sea. Ultimately, Goldstein advocates a restructured US-Japan
alliance and Chinese endorsement of a permanent seat for Japan on the
United Nations Security Council.

Tensions in the South China Sea have recently overshadowed antagonistic
relations between Beijing and Tokyo, and Goldstein's chapter on the
topic is both timely and sobering. [Beijing's official stance and the
opinions expressed by leading Chinese academics have become more
hawkish. US-China rivalry in the region has also
intensified]{.underline} following Chinese construction and land
reclamation projects over the past year. Voices of moderation are now
rare on both sides of the Pacific. [Goldstein reminds readers, however,
that **Beijing made many compromises in the past** to settle its land
border disputes. The present situation is undoubtedly dangerous because
of misperceptions and disturbing action/reaction patterns, but it need
not inevitably become "the 'Fulda Gap']{.underline} of a new Cold War"
(p. 291). [Creating the conditions for a cooperation spiral will be
difficult, and Goldstein proposes **modest initial steps**]{.underline}.
To begin, the United States should invite China to play a major role at
the annual Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training exercises in
Thailand. Bangkok enjoys excellent relations with both Washington and
Beijing, and the exercises focus on nontraditional security issues like
counterterrorism, an issue the Chinese Navy explicitly embraces. China
should respond by proposing a regional antipiracy patrol in the Malacca
Strait area in cooperation with the US Navy. As the two countries build
up greater trust, China must clarify the precise nature of its claims in
the South China Sea and make those claims consistent with the Law of the
Sea. From there, the United States can begin supporting bilateral
negotiations between China and other claimants so that China can
operationalize a joint development program for the South China Sea
guided by a 50/50 split framework.

In sum, Goldstein argues that [China must adjust some of its long-held
claims]{.underline}, increase the transparency of its national security
apparatus, and press countries like North Korea and Iran to conform to
international norms. [The **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [should **reciprocate** by **drawing back some
of its military deployments**]{.underline} and military engagement
activities, including trimming its force of aircraft carriers. [He
admits that hardly any of the compromises he suggests will be
easy]{.underline}. Leaders in both countries must show bravery and avoid
popular China-bashing and America-bashing. Washington needs to also
resist pressure from Asian allies to take a more forceful stance against
China. Exercising restraint and dealing with China as an equal will not
be easy, but as Goldstein concludes, there is no other way.

[Meeting China Halfway **never calls for unilateral concessions**, and
none of his policy proposals are **set in stone**. **Gradualism**,
**reciprocity**, and **mutual compromise** are the core
principles]{.underline} of his approach. As his painstaking research
demonstrates, a very substantial number of Chinese scholars and
strategists want to work constructively with the United States. However,
if US policymakers opt for containment rather than engagement, then
China's own hawks will carry the day in Beijing. [A new cold war will
undermine **regional stability** and decrease the chances for US-China
cooperation across the board]{.underline}. Goldstein concedes that
[Washington must **hedge against the worst-case scenario**]{.underline},
but to make this hedge the central thrust of US China policy would be a
colossal mistake.

#### Yes Taiwan compromise---Their ev doesn't assume rapprochement

(Lyle, *Meeting China Halfway*, pg. 72)

Although Washington and Beijing have increasingly taken one another as
rivals in recent years, [Taiwan and the Mainland have been taking
concrete and frequently difficult steps toward peace]{.underline}. As
one Mainland visitor to Taiwan recently said: "I really want more
mainland people to come and see Taiwan, and then they will understand
\[that\] ... it's not like what they see on the TV.... This impression
will gradually let Mainland people, especially my generation, think:
'Oh, Taiwan is so good, why do we want to conquer them? It's not
necessary. We should learn from them.'" [This]{.underline} comment
[illustrates the strength of interdependence in action]{.underline}. 70
[Given unpredictable electoral politics in Taipei, some Western
commentators are already predicting Chinese "sabre-rattling" and a new
cross-Strait crisis just over the horizon, but **astute diplomacy** in
Washington, Beijing, and Taipei can help to mitigate the impact of these
foreseeable difficulties]{.underline}. 71 [History, geography, culture,
and economics are all compelling the cross-Strait rapprochement. Instead
of attempting to counter this trend, US strategy should **seize upon
this opportunity** to achieve the breakthrough that will be imperative
to US-China cooperation]{.underline} in the twenty-first century.

#### Our scholarship is way better than theirs---CP empowers moderates, plan empowers hardliners

Lyle J. Goldstein's Meeting China Halfway is essential reading for
anyone interested in US foreign relations or contemporary China. A
senior China scholar at the Naval War College, Goldstein warns that [the
potential for US-China military conflict has increased markedly in the
past ten years. Influential academics]{.underline} like Aaron Friedberg
(A Contest for Supremacy: China, America, and the Struggle for Mastery
in Asia \[2011\]) and John Mearsheimer (The Tragedy of Great Power
Politics \[2014\]) [have urged US policymakers to abandon
engagement]{.underline} and focus on containment. [The]{.underline}
Barack [Obama administration]{.underline}, Goldstein notes,
[has]{.underline} largely [endorsed the program advocated by those
seeking to balance China's rise]{.underline}. In China, meanwhile,
discourse regarding the United States has become more bellicose[.
Many]{.underline} [high-ranking officials in China's security and
defense establishments see the United States as China's greatest
national security threat]{.underline}. If the downward spiral in
US-China relations continues, Goldstein argues, the result will likely
be a "repetition of the misery caused by the catastrophic wars and
wasteful rivalries of the twentieth century" (p. 325). [Drawing from a
wide array of Chinese and American sources, Goldstein lays out a plan to
enable the two powers to step back from rivalry and move toward **mutual
accommodation**]{.underline}. From its position of strength, Washington
must take the lead and begin accommodating China's interests in Asia.
For America, Goldstein concludes, "there is no viable alternative to
meeting China halfway" (p. 364).

[Goldstein makes his case by taking Chinese voices
seriously]{.underline} and proposing ten "cooperation spirals" that
outline step-by-step approaches for resolving the seemingly intractable
problems in US-China relations. Cooperation spirals build trust and
confidence over time through incremental and reciprocal steps that
gradually lead to larger and more significant compromises. In each
chapter, [Goldstein explores]{.underline} a particular issue [by
examining]{.underline} its [historical background]{.underline},
[analyzing numerous Chinese and American perspectives]{.underline}, and
then laying out a cooperation spiral composed of ten concrete policy
proposals---five for the United States and five for China. [Goldstein's
analysis of Chinese scholarship reveals a **wide range of opinion**,
even on controversial issues like Taiwan. In a field where many writers
are quick to dismiss Chinese viewpoints as propaganda---if they bother
to examine them at all---Meeting China Halfway stands out as **a model
of rigorous, even-handed scholarship.**]{.underline}

[China hawks and believers in American exceptionalism will find many of
Goldstein's ideas hard to swallow]{.underline}, but they would be wise
to read his book carefully. [Far too much writing on China rests on
ideologically tinged assumptions]{.underline} that Beijing must
institute American-style political and economic reforms in order to
stave off social unrest or collapse. [Goldstein has little sympathy for
such views, which reveal more about American anxieties than they do
about China]{.underline}. Confidence that China will become much
stronger over the coming decades, and that its economy will soon surpass
that of the United States in size, undergirds his basic arguments. He
also points out that China has already moved ahead of the US military in
certain domains, such as anti-ship cruise missiles. Yet just because
Goldstein believes the United States cannot hope to impose its will on
China does not mean he advocates making concessions without asking
Beijing to adjust its current and long-held positions in return. Rather,
Goldstein urges Washington to demonstrate real leadership and courage in
making the first moves. The fact is, as he shows, China's perspective
has been influenced by their view of a "century of humiliation." While
the United States did not take the lead in much of the Western
imperialism that undermined Chinese sovereignty in the century leading
up to World War II, it still played a large role. Imagine if the Chinese
Navy had patrolled the Mississippi River with gunboats from the 1850s to
the 1940s, as the US Navy did on China's Yangtze River, and you can
begin to understand why it is imperative that Washington acts first.

The Taiwan problem has long been a key irritant in US-China relations.
Goldstein's cooperation spiral for this issue rests on the assumption
that the United States cannot indefinitely maintain close security ties
with a claimed island off the coast of a nuclear-armed superpower. He
urges Washington to create circumstances that promote the settlement of
the Taiwan problem rather than its perpetuation. Taiwan-Mainland
integration, Goldstein argues, will actually strengthen US alliances
with Japan and South Korea by preventing these countries from being
pulled by treaty commitments into a conflict over Taiwan. Goldstein
seeks a permanent solution by beginning with smaller moves: reducing US
forces on Guam and closing the military office at the American Institute
in Taipei while Beijing instigates military exchanges with Taiwan
without preconditions and pulls missiles back from East China. The
cooperation spiral culminates with Washington halting weapons sales to
Taiwan, and Beijing renouncing the use of force and beginning a peace
treaty process that joins Taiwan and the Mainland in a confederation.
Goldstein concludes that a breakthrough on the Taiwan problem is
"imperative to U.S.-China cooperation in the twenty-first century" (p.
72).

interdependence does not preclude conflict. America was Japan's leading

political transition offers Washington a window of opportunity to
improve relations with Beijing. Rather than risk a continuing downward
spiral]{.underline} [in the critical US-China relationship]{.underline},
President Barack [Obama must move quickly]{.underline} in his second
term [to take advantage of this]{.underline} opportunity. At last week's
18th Party Congress, Beijing began a **[once-in-a-decade leadership
transition]{.underline}**. The new leaders who will take office in March
-- including [President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang -- know first
hand some of the worst excesses of the]{.underline} Chinese Communist
Party ([CCP]{.underline}). [They were victims of Mao's Great Proletarian
Cultural Revolution, when an entire generation of young people -- many
from prominent families -- were "sent down" to rural areas for years to
perform backbreaking manual labor. Having experienced and survived
widespread human rights abuses]{.underline} that occurred between 1966
and 1976, the year of Mao's death, [China's new leaders will be more
receptive to calls for]{.underline} political [reform from the country's
middle class and liberal intellectuals, who are highly critical
of]{.underline} increasing corruption and cronyism with [the
CCP]{.underline}. Pressure from the middle class is driving a push for
political reform at the same time that China's leaders are dealing with
daunting challenges arising from rapid economic development -- among
them glaring social inequality, inflation, frequent "mass incidents,"
social unrest, and environmental degradation. [China's new leaders will
welcome overtures from Washington along with any US policies that aim to
assist China in meeting the challenges it faces]{.underline}.
[But]{.underline} harsh US trade measures or [increased military
pressure will likely be met with a tough response as the new leaders
seek to prove their mettle and their capability to defend China's
national interests]{.underline}. [Beijing's political transition comes
at a time when the United States stands at a crossroads in US-China
relations]{.underline}. We urgently need a national debate to rethink
our China policy and prevent doing permanent damage to US interests in
Asia. [Increased tensions with China could]{.underline} have dire
consequences. They could [lead to a military conflict over Taiwan's
political status, over]{.underline} whether Japan or China holds
sovereignty to a group of uninhabitable islands in [the
E]{.underline}ast [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea,
[or]{.underline} over the ownership of small islands and energy
resources in [the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina
[S]{.underline}ea. In a worst-case scenario, **[those conflicts could
escalate]{.underline}**, by accident or design, **[to]{.underline}** a
**[nuclear exchange]{.underline}**. It is essential to remember that
China's rise strengthens the US economy and its future prosperity. Trade
with China -- the third-largest US export market -- has aided America's
recovery during the global financial crisis. Between 2000 and 2011, US
exports to China increased by about 640 percent, going from \$16 billion
to \$104 billion. China is the largest growth market in the world for US
exports and supports thousands of high-quality jobs. [The best way to
overcome the "China threat" and advance US interests in the region is by
achieving a **stable peace** with China through the **resolution of
outstanding security**]{.underline} and economic
**[conflicts]{.underline}** between the two countries. This would enable
the US to deal decisively with the very legitimate concerns many
Americans have over China's commercial practices, including infringement
of intellectual property rights, undervalued currency, and protectionist
measures that favor domestic industries. [Through a new policy approach,
we can ensure China is a future partner and not a threat to US
interests]{.underline}. [This policy should]{.underline} embrace the
following objectives:  **[significantly reduce China's]{.underline}**
current and potential **[military threat to Taiwan]{.underline}**, thus
securing Taiwan's democracy;  achieve a pull-back of Chinese forces
from a defined coastal security zone surrounding Japan;  have China
submit its maritime disputes in the South and East China Seas to an
independent international judicial body;  increase security cooperation
with China on both regional and global issues;  substantially increase
China's military transparency, especially in the development of new
weapons systems;  facilitate new bilateral and regional free trade
agreements that will unleash unprecedented levels of international trade
and investment, generating hundreds of thousands of new US jobs; 
greatly strengthen the advocates of human rights and democracy in China
by depriving security forces of their "most dependable weapon," in the
view of former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky: an external security
threat from the United States which is now used to legitimize internal
political repression. PacNet 1003 Bishop Street, Suite 1150, Honolulu,

[for]{.underline} achieving [substantive progress in US-China
relations]{.underline} across a range of difficult issues. [A
cooperation spiral may be considered **the precise opposite of an
escalation spiral**]{.underline}--- which is frequently interpreted as
the result of fear and misperception when leaders confront security
dilemmas. 41 [In a cooperation spiral]{.underline}, [trust and
confidence are built]{.underline} over time **[through]{.underline}**
incremental and [**reciprocal steps** that]{.underline} gradually [lead
to larger and more significant compromises]{.underline}. To be sure,
these proposed steps will be difficult--- and thus their related
challenges are fully analyzed in the chapters that follow--- but
[their]{.underline} gradual, evolutionary, and [**reciprocal nature**
make them]{.underline} a [feasible]{.underline} guide for practitioners.

Unfortunately, the leading journals in East Asian international
relations, such as Asian Survey and International Security, appear to
neglect the issue of how to foster US-China cooperation. 42
Alternatively, academic journals that do take international cooperation
as their focus, such as Conflict Management and Peace Science, have
tended to disregard the issue of China, and US-China relations in
particular. A veritable intellectual chasm has therefore seemed to open
up with respect to fresh scholarship on how Beijing and Washington might
cooperate in the twenty-first century.

Nevertheless, a number of relevant insights from the quite extensive
theoretical debate--- which generally pits "neoliberals" against
"neorealists"--- regarding the nature of cooperation in world politics
are summarized here. Two pioneers in the study of international
cooperation, Robert Axelrod and Robert Keohane, warn at the outset that
"achieving cooperation is difficult in world politics, ... \[where\]
cheating and deception are endemic." They highlight the importance of
the "mutuality of interests," as expressed in "payoff structures," the
"shadow of the future," and the number of actors involved. Each of these
issues is pertinent to the prospects for US-China cooperation, given
that [one may evaluate whether Beijing and Washington indeed
prefer]{.underline} "[mutual cooperation]{.underline}" [to]{.underline}
"[mutual defection]{.underline}," because that cannot be assumed. They
emphasize, moreover, that the "mutuality of interests is not based
simply on objective factors, but is grounded upon the actors' perception
of their own interests. Perceptions define interests." [These scholars
evaluate]{.underline} both the possibilities and risks of [**"issue
linkage"** in facilitating cooperation]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
also [the likely constraints posed by domestic politics]{.underline}.
[They]{.underline} appear to [**offer strong support** for the proposed
cooperation spiral model]{.underline}, [when they assert
that]{.underline} "**[a strategy based on reciprocity]{.underline}**---
[such as **tit for tat**]{.underline}--- [can be remarkably effective in
promoting cooperation]{.underline}, ... [even among pure
egoists]{.underline}." Still, even these foremost advocates of
cooperation are quite cognizant that attempts at reciprocity can devolve
into "acrimonious and frustrating patterns of bargaining," but also that
the most effective motive for cooperation between rivals in world
politics has generally been the "activities of a third power." 43
Cheating and the problem of relative gains also pose significant
challenges for policymakers that seek mutual accommodation by employing
cooperation spirals. Nevertheless, [Asia specialists are]{.underline}
still [very much intrigued by the possibilities for reinvigorated
engagement]{.underline}, as one scholar explained in the summer of 2013
in the leader article of Global Asia: "[Engagement invites
**reciprocity**]{.underline}, thus [setting in motion **a succession of
positive changes in policy**]{.underline} and outlook quite **[opposite
from the ladder of escalation]{.underline}** that characterizes all too
many international conflicts." 44

(Lyle, *Meeting China Halfway*, pg. 12-14)

[The cooperation spiral model]{.underline}, as applied in this book
across a wide variety of difficult policy dilemmas in US-China
relations, [draws on all major traditions in
**i**]{.underline}nternational **[r]{.underline}**elations
[theory]{.underline}. [From the constructivist tradition]{.underline},
the model relies on the conception that [ideas and norms have force unto
themselves]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} therefore [creative
diplomacy]{.underline} and focused leadership [can]{.underline}
potentially [break **divisive deadlocks** and **prevent**]{.underline}
the tragedy of **[great power conflict]{.underline}**.
[From]{.underline} [the liberal tradition]{.underline}, the model adopts
certain precepts related to **[processes]{.underline}**, and
specifically to those institutions that [can guide expectations and
behavior]{.underline}--- thus **[building trust and
enabling]{.underline}** further **[cooperation]{.underline}**. Finally,
though in somewhat obvious contradiction to realist predictions of
rivalry, [the cooperation spiral]{.underline} also [takes certain
realist principles as essential]{.underline}, [including the principles
that cooperative measures must be consistent with state
interests]{.underline}, must accord with tendencies in the balance of
power, [and **must**]{.underline} also **[be reciprocal in
nature]{.underline}** to the extent possible. Therefore, the proposed
model also represents a realist form of cooperation. Stimulating a wider
discussion of alternative steps within the proposed cooperation spirals
would constitute, in itself, a major contribution to this field. After
all, this author hardly purports to be Moses with a Hundred
Commandments. [The twin **key points** of this approach are that
**reciprocity is necessary**]{.underline} and that practical first steps
must be found. The endpoints only seem utopian in the absence of the
accomplishments that result from climbing the earlier steps, and even if
the endpoints remain out of reach, each step represents a significant
advance. For instance, the European Union could not have emerged except
at the end of a path of cooperation that began with small and tentative
cooperative efforts that proved themselves intrinsically useful. 48

### AT: Bargain Now / CP = Squo

#### US is doubling down on US support now---It's explicit maintenance of the status quo and security commitments, not a good-faith attempt at a bargain

Keeps Improving Prized Relations With US, 2018,
<https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/bargaining-chip-or-not-taiwan-keeps-improving-prized-relations-us>

[Two arms-related deals, a congressional bill]{.underline} [that calls
for more senior]{.underline}-level Taipe[i-Washington visits and a
string of comments from the United States in support of Taiwan's foreign
diplomacy this year have raised fears that Trump is using ties with
Taipei just to get concessions out of China]{.underline}. Two days after
Taiwan cut ties Aug. 21 with El Salvador, the U.S. State Department
expressed "grave concern" and warned the Central American country
against taking economic incentives from China. In another sign of closer
Taipei-Washington relations, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen made two
unusually visible stops in the United States earlier this month over
protests from Beijing. She gave a speech August 13 in Los Angeles. In
Houston she became the first Taiwan president since the 1970s to visit
federal property. China sees self-ruled Taiwan as part of its territory,
not as a country, and resents major powers such as the United States for
interacting with it. China and Taiwan have been separately ruled since
the Chinese civil war of the 1940s. Move to check China Since Tsai took
office in 2016, Beijing has flown military aircraft near Taiwan at least
a dozen times and, officials in Taipei say, persuaded five countries to
drop Taiwan as an ally. Tsai rejects Beijing's condition for dialogue,
that both sides talk as parts of the same country. [The US doesn't seek
a stalemate in cross-Strait relations; it seeks positive improvement,
and would not oppose better relations, according to Bonnie Glaser,
director of the China Power Project at the American think tank Center
for International and Strategic Studies. Washington has long advocated
stability between China and Taiwan]{.underline} rather than one side
provoking the other. "[U.S. policy makers aren't seeking ways to use
Taiwan to increase leverage over China," Glaser said. "In response to
stepped up military, political and economic pressure by Beijing on
Taiwan, the Trump administration is signaling support for the
maintenance of the cross-Strait status quo and for Taiwan's
security]{.underline}." Stronger Asia-Pacific alliance [Trump may see
Taiwan as part of an Asia Pacific alliance that would resist China,
said]{.underline} [Lin Chong-pin, a retired strategic studies professor
in Taiwan.]{.underline} "He's also trying to unite the allies in the
East Asian Pacific region to form a united front against China and to
add pressure on China," Lin said. "Not only Japan, Australia and India,
but Taiwan is also one them along with South Korea in forming a united
front against China. That's the intention." [Washington stepped up
military cooperation last year]{.underline} with Australia, India and
Japan to keep the South China Sea open to international traffic. Beijing
claims about 90 percent of that waterway.

### AT: Bargain = Appeasement

#### China desires to unify with Taiwan for nationalistic and defensive purposes. It is impossible to determine whether China desires hegemony in the region, but US assistance projects to Japan and naval presence ensure that a unified China would not catalyze expansionism.

Fourth, [the United States and China may disagree about the future of
the U.S. military presence and alliances in Northeast Asia]{.underline}.
John Mearsheimer argues that once its power has increased sufficiently,
China will be determined to drive the United States from the region,
because achieving regional hegemony will increase its security. In a
similar vein, [Aaron Friedberg]{.underline} argues that although China's
long-term goals remain uncertain, "what [China's current rulers appear
to want and what their successors will almost certainly want as well, is
to see their country become the dominant or predominant power in East
Asia\... despite repeated claims to the contrary, it does seek a form of
regional hegemony.]{.underline}"36 Friedberg identifes multiple reasons
for this assessment, including China's national security; its historical
identity as the region's predominant power; the desire of the
authoritarian regime to retain power; and the natural inclination of a
rising power to want to expand its influence, which would require
reducing or eliminating the United States' role in the region. According
to Friedberg, [China faces a difficult dilemma, because U.S. security
guarantees reduce Japan's need for nuclear weapons and larger
conventional forces.]{.underline} "If it is to establish itself in a
position of unquestioned predominance in East Asia," writes Friedberg,
"China must ªnd a way to bring Taiwan back, and push America out, while
keeping Japan down."37 As a result, China's strategy and pace for
achieving regional hegemony is still to be decided; what is clear,
according to his analysis, is the direction in which China wants to
head. In contrast, [Michael Swaine concludes that "neither China's
existing grand strategy nor public PRC \[People's Republic of China\]
documents, statements, and formal policy actions provide conclusive
evidence of . . . \[a\] commitment to undermine or replace U.S.
power."**38 This is consistent with my view, grounded in defensive
realist logic, that China can be very secure with the United States
maintaining its alliances and forward deployment. Given that hegemony
would provide only a small increase in its security, China should find
the risks unwarranted**]{.underline}. The only signifcant caveat
concerns the U.S. ability to pressure China with a blockade during a
conflict over Taiwan.39 However, whether China has nonsecurity motives
for pursuing regional hegemony---including ideational rationales for
wanting to be the region's dominant power---is a separate question.40 If
it does, then the current U.S. grand strategy will be incompatible with
China's goals, and intense competition is likely to ensue. [The nature
and extent of China's motives and ambitions are possibly the key factors
determining whether U.S. accommodation would, on net, contribute to U.S.
objectives in Asia]{.underline}. Assessing the motives of a rising power
is diffcult because increased military capability could enhance the
ability, and therefore the willingness, of both greedy states and
security seekers to achieve expansionist geopolitical objectives.41 The
China case is further complicated by disagreements about the
geopolitical status quo, which lead the United States and China to
divergent views of whether efforts to acquire disputed territory reflect
greedy or security motives.42 Many American experts are increasingly
concerned that China's ambitions and assertiveness are growing in step
with its power.43 Other experts, however, question whether this is
true.44 Therefore, U.S. policy toward China will necessarily involve
balancing the risks generated by this uncertainty. **[From the United
States' perspective, there is broad agreement on Taiwan--- China's goal
of unifcation makes China a limited-aims expansionist
state.]{.underline}** Whether this desire to revise the status quo
reflects greedy or security-seeking motives, however, is a complicated
matter, because China and the United States disagree about what
constitutes the status quo. [From China's perspective, control of Taiwan
is a security objective because China considers Taiwan part of its
homeland.45 In contrast, given the United States' understanding of the
status quo, China's determination to control Taiwan reflects greedy
motives]{.underline}. Since the late 2000s, with the change in Taiwan's
leadership, cross-strait relations have been increasingly good; thus,
the Taiwan issue has not fueled growing concern about China's
assertiveness.

ideal, the author is very clear in his desire to debunk the fallacy that
the United States and China must inevitably go to war or that China's
rise is occurring at the expense of the United States. The short version
of his tale is that a second cold war is neither necessary nor
desirable. The author [relies on his background in the U.S. government
to argue that a cold war]{.underline} between the United States and
China [is not in American national interest]{.underline} whether one
looks at the security or the economic aspects. [He is critical of
the]{.underline} China [hawks, who]{.underline}, he believes,

the sensible language of a seasoned diplomat and official, but
[also]{.underline} he [relies on an extensive use of quotations from the

[China considers U.S. support of Taiwan a key source of "strategic
distrust." A recent study by two leading authorities on U.S.-China
relations concludes that Beijing views **U.S. arms sales to Taiwan** "as
confirming American arrogance and determination to interfere in China's
domestic affairs and to prevent peaceful unification from occurring,
thereby harming a clearly-articulated Chinese core
interes]{.underline}t." In a similar vein, their report argues that
"continuing to provide Taiwan with advanced weapons . . . is viewed as

position is secondary to America's.

Several **[policy implications]{.underline}** [can be drawn
from]{.underline} this [analysis of the Chinese response to Japan\'s
involvement in]{.underline} the [TMD]{.underline} co-research project.
[An **Immediate Halt**]{.underline} to TMD Joint Research
[Would]{.underline} [**Undermine Japan\'s Security Interests** Japanese
willingness to participate in]{.underline} a [co-]{.underline}research
project on [TMD]{.underline} [has come largely in response to **North
Korean** missile launches and nuclear threats. Intimidated by North
Korea\'s]{.underline} latent [capability to build advanced ballistic
missiles, Japan had no choice but to]{.underline} review its defense
posture and [consider]{.underline} [new]{.underline} defense
[options]{.underline} [needed to heighten its security]{.underline}. The
Japanese govern- ment began taking concrete steps to normalize its
bilateral relations with North Korea, but as Defence Agency
Director-General Kawara Tsutomu re- cently stated, North Korean
ballistic missiles remain a major security threat to Japan despite a
moratorium on test launches of Taepo Dong 11.36 [Accord- ingly, Japan
should by no means bargain away its security]{.underline} option [solely
be- cause of opposition put up by another state. Moreover]{.underline},
[there is little doubt that Japan\'s TMD initiative also largely has
been a response to **ballistic missile proliferation**]{.underline} [in
the region for which China is partially responsible. A senior U.S.
national security official stated that China has been cooperating with
North Korea in the development of both satellite and launch]{.underline}
[tech]{.underline}nologies, [which suggests that China is technologi-
cally linked to]{.underline} the firing of [North Korea\'s]{.underline}
Taepo Dong I [missile]{.underline} in 1998.37 [Furthermore]{.underline},
the Taiwan Strait crisis of 1996, when China test-fired its short- range
Dong Feng-15 ballistic missile, elevated the possibility that
[China]{.underline} [could use such offensive weapons]{.underline}.
Additionally, some now speculate that the total number of the coastally
deployed M-9s and shorter-range M- us has grown to 150-200 missiles, and
would eventually rise to more than 600 by 2005 should the current trend
continue.38 [It would be ideal if Japan\'s vulnerability to ballistic
missile threats could be overcome solely by diplomatic
means]{.underline} such as MTCR [and]{.underline} other missile
nonproliferation [export control]{.underline} regimes. [But]{.underline}
as crucial as export control poli- cies are to securing missile
nonproliferation, [MTCR is by no means a pan- acea for
solving]{.underline} the problems of [missile
proliferation]{.underline}. [Diplomatic means alone cannot ensure
Japan\'s (or anyone else\'s) security. As such, TMD]{.underline} R&D
**[should not be halted immediately]{.underline}** [but **pursued, with
some circumspection, as an insurance policy**]{.underline} [against the
possibility of **ballistic missile threats height- ening**]{.underline}
again in the future. [Use of TMD as a **Diplomatic Card**]{.underline}
[in Discussing Regional Missile Initiatives Continuation of the
TMD]{.underline} [co-research does not imply **disregarding China\'s
concerns**]{.underline} [over TMD]{.underline} altogether. [Japan and
the U.S. should certainly work to **decrease China\'s threat
perception**]{.underline} where possible. Recently, some observers have
urged that **[TMD should be used as a card]{.underline}** [to **entice
Chinese participation**]{.underline} [in a formal **trilateral security
dialogue**]{.underline}.39 [In fact]{.underline}, some **[Chinese
analysts]{.underline}** [have indicated that China might consider making
**missile-related pledges** **in ex- change** for a **partial TMD
deployment commitment**]{.underline} [and Chinese **official
statements**]{.underline} have [appea]{.underline}red [to bespeak the
possibility of such **bargaining**]{.underline}. For instance, [Zhu
Rongji has been quoted as saying]{.underline}, \"[Whether or
not]{.underline} you \[[the U.S.\] **build** a TMD, that\'s your
business.]{.underline} [But if you]{.underline} [were to get Taiwan
**involved** in this TMD, then China]{.underline}\'s position is that it
[would be adamantly opposed]{.underline} [to such]{.underline} an
[action]{.underline}.\"40 As another example, some Chinese experts have
indicated that China would soften its position on U.S.-Japan TMD ini-
tiative to a \"de facto acquiescence\" if the U.S. and Japan would
explicitly reject Taiwanese involvement in the joint project.41 [Such
statements]{.underline} would appear to [indicate that]{.underline} a
degree of **[bargaining is possible]{.underline}** [if **heed** is paid
to China\'s **bottom line** on TMD. There are a number of missile
initiatives worth discussing with China. For example,]{.underline}
possible **[TMD limits]{.underline}** [could be **set in return for
China\'s pledge not to deploy MIRVs**]{.underline} [and **strategic
cruise missiles**. A TMD system also could be only partially deployed in
return for China\'s pledge to **decrease** **its coastal missile
deployments**.]{.underline} [However, Japan should not pursue
initiatives such as these on an exclusively Chinese basis, as North
Korean missiles are of seri- ous concern]{.underline} as well. It is
desirable to pursue any missile initiatives with a long-term goal of
including North Korea. Christensen argues that [by **agree- ing to limit
TMD**, Japan and the U.S. may be able to **gain more active partici-
pation**]{.underline} [from Beijing in **discouraging further North
Korean missile develop- ment**]{.underline}.42 [The U.S. and Japan
could, for example, agree to limit TMD **in ex- change**]{.underline}
[for North Korea\'s full compliance]{.underline} with the Perry
process.43 **[The crit- ical element]{.underline}** [in promoting such
initiatives will be **how to positively and constructively
engage**]{.underline} [both China and North Korea in discussions on the
re- gion\'s missile milieu for which they are largely
responsible.]{.underline}

[A **sophisticated missile defense** system being delivered]{.underline}
to South Korea [may give]{.underline} President [Trump a **bargaining
chip** that **no other U.S. president has had** to **pressure China to
rein in North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear programs**. Beijing
has long expressed anger over the]{.underline} Terminal High-Altitude
Area Defense (THAAD) [shield]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} on
Wednesday, [just]{.underline} [two days after the Trump administration
announced]{.underline} the start of [the system's deployment, Chinese
officials suddenly signaled that they may be ready to increase pressure
on Pyongyang. In an unusual and public proposal that analysts say
exposed Beijing's growing alarm]{.underline} over the situation on the
Korean Peninsula, [Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters that
Pyongyang could suspend its nuclear and missile activities in exchange
for a halt]{.underline} in joint U.S.-South Korean military drills that
the North has long condemned as a rehearsal for an invasion. The
[Trump]{.underline} administration [and South Korea quickly threw cold
water on the proposal]{.underline} as the U.N. Security Council convened
a closed-door session on Pyongyang's ballistic missile tests ---
including a simultaneous launch Monday in which a missile crashed into
waters just 190 miles off the coast of Japan. [The State Department said
China's suggested trade-off was not a "viable deal]{.underline}," and
U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said the regime of North Korean leader Kim
Jong-un would first have to take "some sort of positive action." "We
have not seen any goodwill at all coming from North Korea," Ms. Haley
said. "I appreciate all my counterparts wanting to talk about talks and
negotiations, \[but\] we are not dealing with a rational person." Added
Japanese Ambassador Koro Bessho: "At the starting point, we need some
assurances \[that the North Koreans\] are serious about the
denuclearization." [But China's overture suggested a sea change within
the high-stakes North Korea diplomacy. For years, Washington has made
fruitless demands on Beijing to put more pressure on]{.underline} Mr.
[Kim. Diplomats said the proposal was an unusual burst of proactive
diplomacy from China, which has resisted]{.underline} [taking the lead
in trying to solve the crisis]{.underline}. It's not clear how much the
Trump administration's move on the THAAD may have motivated the Chinese,
but [Beijing has made no secret of its displeasure with the system,
which it claims can be used to undercut its nuclear arsenal. Analysts
say Mr. Wang's statements laid bare Beijing's mounting frustration with
Kim Jong-un and spiking concern over a potential confrontation on the
Korean Peninsula. The Chinese foreign minister said
friction]{.underline} between Pyongyang on one hand and Washington and
Seoul on the other [was like "two accelerating trains" headed toward
each other]{.underline}, with neither side willing to give way. "The
question is: Are the two sides really ready for a head-on collision?" he
told reporters in Beijing. "[Our priority now is to flash the red light
and apply the brakes on both trains]{.underline}." Although he stopped
short of announcing a commitment from Pyongyang to embrace Beijing's
proposal, Mr. [Wang said it could be a first step to defuse a looming
crisis.]{.underline} "This **[suspension-for-suspension]{.underline}**
[can help us **break out of the security dilemma**]{.underline} [and
bring the parties **back to the negotiating table**]{.underline}," he
said. Bargaining chip? Speculation swirled over the extent to which the
Trump administration plans to exert pressure on China.

<https://sipa.columbia.edu/academics/capstone-projects/influencing-outcomes-east-asia-leveraging-usjapan-security-alliance>

The aim of this Capstone project is to identify the current regional
security challenges the United States is facing in East Asia. [The two
leading challenges are **Chinese expansion** in the **South China Sea**
and the continued pursuit of a **nuclear and ballistic missile program**
by the]{.underline} Democratic People's Republic of Korea ([**DPRK**).
Due to these security threats, it is **vital** for the United States and
Japan to address these challenges to]{.underline} help [ensure regional
**peace and stability**.]{.underline}

[The United States has publicly announced its "pivot" to Asia and Japan
has pushed new security legislation through the Diet]{.underline}.
Regional stakeholders are themselves "pivoting" towards the United
States sphere of influence in response to Chinese activity. With \$5.3
trillion in trade and 80 percent of Japan's oil imports passing through
the South China Sea, it is imperative that the United States ensure a
stable area for the movement of commerce. [There is room for both
Chinese growth and a continued U.S. security presence as long as
stakeholders operate by established international rules and
norms.]{.underline}

[The Capstone team recommends that the United States]{.underline}
[continue to foster Japanese defense sector growth,]{.underline} pursue
multilateral freedom of navigation operations, [and develop a
joint]{.underline} intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
[program]{.underline} with regional partners [in order to apply
**pressures** to China]{.underline}. [Additionally, the team recommends
increased U.S. **diplomatic outreach** to East Asian countries in order
to pursue a **negotiated demilitarization** of China's islands in the
**South China Sea** and **utilize the potential of a** **bolstered
missile defense system** **in Japan** as a **bargaining
chip.**]{.underline}

#### That's key---They'll say yes IF and ONLY IF we have that bargaining chip

As [some critics argue, to expect the **TMD card**]{.underline} [alone
to elicit]{.underline} a **[major arms control]{.underline}** agreement
[may be unrealistic]{.underline}. [Nevertheless, the idea of missile-re-
lated, arms control **pledge exchanges** is **not**]{.underline}
entirely [inconceivable]{.underline}, [as]{.underline} some **[Chinese
experts]{.underline}** [are actually **sending positive
signals**]{.underline} [regarding such an initia- tive, while **official
Chinese statements** are becoming]{.underline} **[increasingly nuanced
in that direction]{.underline}**. [Japan and the U.S. could work to
decrease China\'s threat per- ception where possible and, **in turn, ask
Beijing to reciprocate**]{.underline}, [where appro-
priate.]{.underline} Described below are two examples of **[bargaining
chips]{.underline}** that [might be used in **promoting such
exchanges**]{.underline}.

[Utilize **TMD Debate** as a **Starting Point** for a Serious
Sino-Japanese Security Dialogue and Other Bilateral CBMs]{.underline}
[China\'s **vehement opposition** to TMD **signals the possibility**
that the current debate could have a strong potential to **become the
starting point for a serious Sino-Japanese security
dialogue**]{.underline}. [My interviews in China poignantly re- vealed
that much of China\'s opposition to Japan\'s involvement in the TMD
project is rooted in China\'s historical distrust of Japan]{.underline}.
The Japanese govern- ment should utilize CBMs with China to alleviate
unnecessary tensions. Japan must be willing to listen more attentively
to Chinese concerns over TMD and be more sensitive to the roots of such
Chinese concerns. [While most of these may stem from a persisting
Chinese distrust of Japan for histor- ical reasons, there are also other
factors that should not be ignored, such as the rise of a **new
nationalism** in China]{.underline} and an ideological rigidity
resulting from recent anti-U.S. hegemony sentiments. [At the same time,
Japan must pay close attention to Beijing\'s internationalist
element]{.underline}, which has grown in recent years, [and endeavor to
further encourage it when there are signs of China wanting to cooperate
with Japan and the U.S. Similarly, China must be just as responsible for
addressing concerns on the Japanese side and reassuring Japan of its
intentions.]{.underline} Some Chinese question why Japan would feel
threatened by China\'s missiles in the first place. One missile expert
asked, \"The Chinese \[short- and mid-range\] missiles \[deployed in
coastal areas\] have always been there, why make such a fuss about them
now?\"47 What they fail to understand is that China\'s missile diplomacy
in 1995 and 1996 left a big scar on Japan\'s security psyche and led
many Japa- nese to doubt the credibility of China\'s no-first-use
pledge.48 Such Japanese concerns over Chinese missile diplomacy cannot
be discredited as being blown out of proportion but need to be discussed
in depth. It must also be noted, however, that China\'s reluctance to
acknowledge Japan as an equal partner will be very difficult to
overcome. As some Chi- nese scholars point out, for various reasons
Beijing still finds it difficult psy- chologically to treat Tokyo as a
full-fledged nation state and is, thus, not yet ready when it comes to
devising CBMs to define Japan as an equal security and military
counterpart.49 As such, the path to Sino-Japanese bilateral CBMs will
remain rocky for the foreseeable future, regardless of which dip-
lomatic card is used to initiate the process. This process, therefore,
needs to be pursued carefully and cautiously so as not to evoke inflated
or unrealistic expectations on either side. In addition to the series of
military exchanges already in place between Tokyo and Beijing, [there
are three]{.underline} other [ideas for future bilateral CBMs worth
noting]{.underline} in passing. [One might be to conduct joint military
exercises for nuclear disaster relief operations.50 A second would be to
establish a joint Japan-China working group to discuss various security
issues]{.underline}, possibly **[start- ing with missile
defense]{.underline}** and its implication on Sino-Japanese relations[.
Fi- nally, the two could **boost cooperation**-]{.underline}and
confidence[-in non-contro- versial areas such as **transnational crime**
(]{.underline}e.g., through joint police investiga- tions [to combat
**drug trafficking** or **terrorism**]{.underline}), [the
**environment**]{.underline}, [and **energy**.]{.underline}

#### All of those escalate---causes US draw-in

Kongdan Oh, Former Brookings Expert Asian Specialist - Institute for
Defense Analysis, Transnational Threats in East Asia, 2014,
<https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/transnational-threats-in-east-asia/>

For a region that hasn't seen a real shooting war in almost 40 years,
[East Asia]{.underline} is surprisingly tense. [Threats abound,
generating anxiety and bad feeling. China continues to flex
its]{.underline} economic and military [muscles and North Korea vows not
to give up its growing nuclear]{.underline} weapons
[arsenal]{.underline}.\[1\] It is at least fortunate that most of the
legacies of past conflict in East Asia have faded. [The war in Southeast
Asia is long over]{.underline}. North Korea, still technically at war
with South Korea and the United Nations Command, has limited itself to
threats and minor skirmishes since the Korean War armistice was signed
in 1953. [Japan and the United States have been close allies for over
half a century, although Japan's geographic neighbors have not forgotten
or forgiven Japan's aggression before and during World War II,
especially with recent talk of expanding Japan's defense capabilities.
And]{.underline} yet, [under the peaceful surface, there is widespread
unease and a real potential for future conflict]{.underline}---conflict
[that would **inevitably draw in the United States**.]{.underline}
Perceiving threats [The]{.underline} issues---or to put it more
strongly---the [threats]{.underline} [that focus attention in East Asian
capitals and provide much of the motivation for defense expenditures
are]{.underline}, [like all threats, socially and politically
defined.]{.underline} Some explicit threats are hardly noticed. An
excellent example is North Korea's frequent threats of impending nuclear
war. Over the years the Kim regime in Pyongyang has labeled dozens of
actions by other countries as "virtual declarations of war," yet there
has been no war. It is not that North Korea lacks the ability to launch
a nuclear war or that it does not have a record of starting a war, but
rather that the warnings have been so constant that they become
background noise. In order for a threat to get the attention of the
public, politicians, and policy analysts, it must be properly framed by
a person or organization of some standing; for example, by a broad range
of news media or by top political officials. What gets defined as a
threat is usually signaled by a dramatic event, such as the events of
9/11, rather than by a gradual transformation such as climate change. It
is also easier to define something as a threat if it fits into a
continuing threat theme. Terrorism, especially from Muslim groups, is
easily seen as a threat. Police brutality, inhumane prison conditions,
dangerous roads and polluted drinking water are not. So what threats do
people in East Asia see today, and are they the same threats that
Americans see? As a basis for this discussion, we can look at a survey
of transnational security challenges published as a 2010 white paper by
the Council for Asian Transnational Threat Research, or CATR.\[2\] CATR,
originally funded by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and managed
by the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA), was established in July
2005 as an organizational tool to combat international terrorism. Its
original name, Council for Asian Terrorism Research, was subsequently
changed to reflect CATR's interest in a broader range of Asian
transnational threats, including maritime security. CATR currently has
20 membership organizations from 15 countries in South and East Asia.
IDA has been the principal organizer of workshops, annual symposia,
special seminars, and publications, under my general guidance and
direction. The contributors to the 2010 white paper came from South and
East Asia, including Pakistan and Afghanistan, but for our purposes we
will omit those two countries because they have their own peculiar
histories of violence. The other contributors are from Bangladesh, Sri
Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, Indonesia, Australia, and
Japan. The report editors, Caroline Ziemke-Dickens from the Institute
for Defense Analyses in the United States (now at the Centre for Defence
Studies at New Zealand's Massey University) and Julian Droogan, from the
Centre for Policing, Intelligence and Counter Terrorism at Australia's
Macquarie University, compiled a list of 27 threats from the eight
country surveys. Seven out of the eight country reports mentioned
[terrorism]{.underline} (except Japan), religious tension (except
Japan), and ethno-linguistic tension (except Bangladesh). Four out of
eight mentioned political-economic class tension, the global financial
crisis, and **[transnational organized crime]{.underline}**. Three out
of the eight mentioned [drug **trafficking**]{.underline},
[demographic]{.underline} and age-based [tension]{.underline}, migration
and [refugee problems, national **disasters**, infectious **disease**,
**energy security**, threats attendant to the **rise of China**, arms
trafficking, and cybersecurity.]{.underline} The threat of conventional
war was mentioned by the authors of only one country survey: the
Philippines. To provide samples of the kind of non-traditional threats
experienced by these countries, here is a brief listing by country.
Bangladesh worries about the full gamut of security challenges, from
environmental change leading to increased flooding, to the inability of
government to deal with infectious disease, poverty and terrorism. The
Sri Lankan government has overcome a decades-long battle with Tamil
separatists, but continuing worries about Tamil remnants and their
international support groups has lead to harsh oppression of this
minority. Malaysia, whose extended peninsular and island territory
exposes the country to a host of destabilizing influences from abroad,
must also deal with the problems of a multi-ethnic population. By
comparison, Singapore is compact and well-governed, but still worries
about challenges to its orderly society from religious fundamentalists.
The Philippines, like Malaysia and Indonesia, has thousands of miles of
borders to protect, a multi-ethnic population some parts of which
shelter terrorist groups, a host of environmental challenges, and in
recent years a territorial dispute over South China Sea islands with an
increasingly intimidating China. Indonesia, host to numerous ethnic and
religious peoples, including the world's largest Muslim population, has
suffered from a history of jihadi terrorism, separatist movements,
political and economic instability. Australia's security problems are
relatively minor, although its capable government still worries about
the social impact of legal and illegal immigrants, especially young
disaffected youth, and the growing economic impact of China's
international search for natural resources. Finally, Japan, with its
largely homogeneous ethnic population, is situated within missile range
of an extremely hostile North Korea that has thousands of supporters
among Japan's Korean ethnic community. All the countries in East Asia
are endangered by typhoons and earthquakes. The chapters on the three
fully developed countries covered in this report (Singapore, Japan, and
Australia) report only half as many threats as the developing country
chapters, although interestingly, twice as many threats are listed for
geographically isolated Australia than for the other two developed
countries---perhaps indicating that threats tend to fill up the time
people have to worry about them. Among the developing countries, the
Bangladesh report lists the most threats. Domestic and transnational
correlation [These security threats are not independent of one another,
and]{.underline} it could be argued that [all]{.underline} threats
[begin at home. Countries with strong, effective governments that are
supported by the people can handle anything that nature or human beings
throw at it. Even great catastrophes like earthquakes, floods, terrorist
attacks or international economic crises can be overcome. On the other
hand, weak]{.underline} ineffectual [governments that lack popular
support are unable even to keep their people healthy. In short, poor
local and national governance has a multiplier effect, causing threats
to **proliferate**]{.underline}. Poverty, lack of education, poor
health, and inadequate public safety cause threats to multiply. For
example, poverty can breed intergroup tensions, crime, and environmental
degradation, which in turn create even more threats. Another conclusion
that can be drawn from this survey is that most of today's threats are
transnational in character. Intergroup tensions, natural disasters, and
energy security may be primarily domestic in nature but are made worse
by conditions outside the country, including poor governance in other
countries. Domestic terrorists usually have links to foreign terrorist
groups or are at least inspired by their ideology. Religious tension
represents a local response to wider religious conflict. And many
ethno-linguistic groups either originate outside the country or are
linked to foreign cultures. By and large, [**solutions** to any kind of
threat **require** **international cooperation**]{.underline}, just as
addressing conventional military threats requires international
teamwork. The white paper suggests that an underlying cause of many
threats is dwindling natural resources coupled with growing populations.
And because in modern times people and nations can't expect to provide
for themselves without cooperation from other people and other nations,
international political problems and trade issues threaten people in all
but the most isolated villages. [Threats are an inescapable consequence
of change]{.underline}. Changes in the environment, society, economy,
culture, and politics require that individuals, groups, and nations make
adjustments. If these adjustments are resisted or come too slowly,
threats appear. This is the case with most of the threats listed in the
white paper. Change comes more quickly now than it did centuries ago,
and it travels more easily from place to place. "Globalization"
epitomizes this phenomenon of rapid and widespread change. It has
traditionally been the responsibility of national and local governments
to initiate and coordinate responses to change so that it does not
destabilize or damage society, but governments by their very nature tend
to move slowly, and governments in less developed countries move slowest
of all. When governments are unable to serve all their people, those
groups who consider themselves to be underserved withdraw their
allegiance from the government, leading to even more serious problems of
governance. The white paper cites many cases of the "securitization of
identity"---that is, groups coming to think of their welfare as a
security issue, just as a military attack on them would be. Two serious
consequences are separatism and terrorism. Roles for the United States
and multilateral organizations Since World War II the United States has
maintained a substantial military presence in East Asia, and since the
end of the Vietnam War most of these forces have been based in Northeast
Asia; that is, in the neighborhood of China and North Korea, which
present two "conventional" threats. However, the United States has a
large economic interest throughout the region and needs to ensure that
East Asian trade routes remain open. To apply the optimal weight of U.S.
power in the service of preserving Asian stability and peace, the Obama
administration has indicated its intention to make a "pivot" by devoting
more security resources to Asia. However, domestic political struggles
and events in Europe and the Middle East have largely prevented this
planned rebalancing of attention and resources. U.S. foreign aid plays a
valuable role in addressing a host of nontraditional threats in East
Asia and throughout the world, but U.S. attention seems focused
overwhelmingly on two issues: nontraditional threats that could turn
into conventional war threats, and terrorism that threatens the U.S.
homeland. Most of the attention on terrorism remains focused on the
Middle East. [In East Asia, disputes]{.underline} over national
jurisdiction in the South and East China Seas, as well as disputes off
the coasts of Japan and South Korea, seem to have engaged the most
attention from the U.S. security establishment. These disputes
[primarily involve **China**]{.underline} and North Korea [on the one
side and the **other East Asian states** on the other]{.underline}. It
is difficult to judge the seriousness of these threats because they have
enveloped themselves in emotional nationalism, even when the economic
interests involved are relatively minor. [The transnational nature of
these threats immediately suggests the need for multinational
organizations to address them]{.underline}. The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations ([ASEAN) and associated bodies are serious organizations,
but they]{.underline} are [largely]{.underline} a forum for dialogue and
[are not currently designed to play an active and forceful role in
solving problems]{.underline}. Northeast Asia doesn't even have a
permanent organization with which to conduct dialogue. [In the absence
of **stronger Asian multinational** organizations, the United States
projects]{.underline} its [military power through bilateral treaties,
and in case of a security crisis, would most likely have to intervene in
a bilateral manner]{.underline}. In many respects [this is not an ideal
way to project force]{.underline}, and moreover it is not consistent
with the Obama administration's latest foreign policy thinking. [What is
needed today is government and non-government organizations to bring
East Asian nations together to address nontraditional, transnational
threats.]{.underline}

For decades, North Korea's nuclear program has ranked among the top
security challenges for the United States. This threat increased in
urgency following a sharp uptick in North Korea's nuclear and missile
tests in 2016 and especially with its first intercontinental ballistic
missile test in July 2017. Then, in June 2018 in Singapore, President
Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met for the first time,
marking a new chapter in U.S. engagement with North Korea. In a joint
statement, the two sides agreed to work toward a new bilateral
relationship, the "complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,"
and a "lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula," as well
as to cooperate on recovering the remains of Americans who had died in
the Korean War.

Since the diplomatic opening created by the Singapore summit, the key
challenge for the United States and its partners has been to develop a
negotiation process capable of sustaining momentum toward those
objectives. This has proved difficult, and negotiations are at a
stalemate. The two sides were most recently unable to come to an
agreement at Trump and Kim's second meeting, which was held in February
2019 in Hanoi, Vietnam.

Washington and Pyongyang are divided over the definition of
denuclearization and how to sequence steps toward achieving
denuclearization, creating a new bilateral relationship, and
establishing a peace regime. North Korea has called for a "phased and
synchronous" approach in which reciprocal concessions are traded between
Washington and Pyongyang in a step-by-step manner. In Hanoi, Kim
demanded the lifting of five of the eleven U.N. sanctions imposed on the
regime, which focus on the civilian economy, in exchange for dismantling
the Yongbyon nuclear complex, an offer Trump was unwilling to accept.
Since the Hanoi summit, Washington has said that it rejects an
"incremental" approach and instead expects both a "big deal" in which
North Korea denuclearizes "fully, finally and verifiably" in return for
complete sanctions relief as well as progress on the other pillars
identified in the Singapore statement.

Observations

China shares Washington's desire for North Korea's denuclearization but
does not believe it is achievable in the short term. Beijing considers a
nuclear North Korea to be inherently destabilizing because it provides a
rationale for U.S. military deployments and possible intervention in the
region, prompts regional actors such as Japan and South Korea to
strengthen their defensive capabilities, and raises calls for the
development of indigenous nuclear capabilities in these countries---all
of which are inimical to China\'s interests and security. Beijing,
therefore, continues to favor a step-by-step, dual-track process for
both advancing denuclearization and creating a peace regime on the
Korean Peninsula.

China is a vital player in efforts to denuclearize North Korea and must
be encouraged to play a constructive role. Because of Beijing's outsized
economic relationship with Pyongyang, its cooperation---or lack of
cooperation---in sanctions enforcement largely determines the
effectiveness of economic pressures. Moreover, North Korean leadership
consults regularly with China and seeks its support in negotiations with
Washington, even as it seeks to play Washington and Beijing off one
another. China's ability to shield Pyongyang from economic and political
pressure makes Beijing an important factor in efforts to influence North
Korea. The United States should work with China to ensure that Beijing
wields this influence constructively, recognizing that Washington and
Beijing will never be in lock step.

Nevertheless, China will not "resolve" the North Korea crisis for the
United States. North Korea seeks security assurances, sanctions relief,
and diplomatic recognition from the United States. China can offer its
own security assurances and sanctions relief, but it cannot provide what
Pyongyang wants in either respect from Washington. Beijing, moreover,
has shown that there are limits on the pressure it will exert on
Pyongyang. It believes that pushing too hard would only reduce its
ability to shape North Korea's behavior and potentially provoke more
risk-acceptant behavior should such pressure prove destabilizing. The
United States, therefore, should not place undue reliance on resolving
the North Korean nuclear conundrum solely through Chinese pressure.

North Korea depends heavily on China. Under growing isolation from
global sanctions, North Korea has become increasingly dependent on China
for trade. To diversify its economic and diplomatic relationships,
Pyongyang therefore seeks improved relationships with the United States
and other countries.

Recommendations

Given the high level of distrust between the United States and North
Korea, Pyongyang is unlikely to agree to an all-or-nothing approach that
requires its immediate and complete denuclearization in return for full
sanctions relief and other diplomatic concessions. The United States
should instead pursue negotiations based on a step-by-step,
parallel-track process that can build the trust necessary for reciprocal
measures toward denuclearization and a peace regime. This approach is
the most practical way to achieve progress toward U.S. national security
objectives.

The step-by-step approach is in broad terms close to the phased and
synchronous approach that both China and North Korea prefer, but
adopting their preferred approach does not also require adopting their
preferred measures. Within such a process, China and North Korea can be
expected to push for reciprocal de-escalation. Washington should
identify measures that it can offer Pyongyang in return for steps toward
denuclearization without reducing (or with minimal reduction in) U.S.
readiness and force posture on the Korean Peninsula.

The United States should work with China as well as regional allies to
implement a coordinated approach to this process. China could be
especially helpful by clearly signaling to Pyongyang that the price of
seeking to be a de facto nuclear power will be continued heavy sanctions
and international opprobrium, and that full denuclearization, over time,
is the best alternative. Moreover, a road map that Washington and
Beijing jointly endorse would send a strong signal to Pyongyang that
efforts to exploit differences between them will fail.

Although defining a road map with China will be neither quick nor easy,
Beijing supports a dual-track approach and is likely to engage in
discussions based on such a premise. China could further
contribute---alongside the United States and South Korea---to the
long-term negotiating process by offering North Korea security and
economic incentives, technical assistance on arms control, and assurance
that it is committed to helping sustain peace on the Korean Peninsula.

U.S. policymakers should avoid linking the North Korea issue to other
issues in the U.S.-China bilateral relationship, including the trade war
and Taiwan. Such linkage would be ineffective, likely create a host of
new problems, and make the fundamental challenge of nuclear weapons in
North Korea even more intractable.

The United States should continue to urge China to strictly enforce
international sanctions imposed against North Korea until Washington and
Beijing---as well as the international community---agree fully on a
process for sanctions relief.

Washington and Beijing should discuss, in both bilateral and
multilateral contexts, how to prevent a nuclear-armed North Korea---even
one that is theoretically denuclearizing---from sparking a cascade of
nuclear proliferation in the region. Inadequate consideration of Japan's
and South Korea's security concerns, especially in regard to
medium-range missiles, could strengthen the arguments of those in both
countries who favor acquiring their own nuclear weapons.

U.S. policymakers should increase efforts to reduce frictions between
Japan and South Korea, bearing in mind that some US strategic
objectives, such as increasing Japan's regional security role,
contribute to these frictions. Widely divergent priorities among U.S.
regional allies regarding negotiations on the Korean Peninsula will
complicate---even undermine---U.S. strategy and create openings that
China could exploit. Disputes between South Korea and Japan that are
unrelated to North Korea could also compromise effective coordination.

If relations between Washington and Pyongyang return to heightened
tensions but relations between the two Koreas continue to improve, it
could create a rift in the Washington-Seoul alliance that Beijing could
exploit. Washington must strive to remain as supportive as possible of
Seoul's approach to building a peace regime on the Peninsula, yet guard
against excessive exuberance in the Blue House. Beijing, Pyongyang, and
Seoul have a common agenda (inter-Korean dialogue and rapprochement)
that might compromise U.S. preferences and leverage in the negotiating
process.

Washington should also begin bilateral and multilateral conversations
with Pyongyang, Seoul, and Beijing, and later with Tokyo and Moscow, on
the contours of a peace regime for the Korean Peninsula. Given the many
interests at stake, starting the conversation early to establish
baseline understandings and work toward a consensus far in advance of
formal negotiations will contribute to the sustainability of the final
outcome.

Be explicit that Taiwan will not be included in any future TMD deploy-

ment. Beijing will not tolerate the covering of the Taiwan Strait by any

future deployment of a Japanese missile defense system. Doing so could

complicate cross-strait relations and Japan should therefore refrain
from in-

cluding Taiwan in U.S.-Japan TMD research and Japan\'s TMD network

should not be deployed to defend Taiwan against Chinese missiles.44
After

all, Japan does not have a Taiwan Relations Act as the U.S. does nor is
it

bound by any legal obligation to protect Taiwan. However, if the
Japanese

TMD system is not deployed to protect Taiwan, then the Chinese will have

significantly less reason to be concerned about Japan\'s R&D on a NTW
sys-

tem, as such opposition is largely based on the logic that the system
could be

mobilized in defense of Taiwan. Though it is highly likely that Beijing

would still oppose Japan\'s TMD on the basis that an upper-tier missile
de-

fense system (whether the sea-based NTW or land-based THAAD) could di-

minish China\'s offensive nuclear capability, at least its concern over
Taiwan

could be greatly mitigated.

One may argue that such a measure would be impossible given the politi-

cal geography of the Taiwan issue and the complexity of the U.S.-Japan
alli-

ance. Many Chinese observers in fact doubt whether Tokyo is capable of
convincing Washington to make such a statement. As a prominent foreign

policy analyst at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences observed,
\"Unfor-

tunately, Japan doesn\'t control the military aspect of the alliance,
the U.S.

does.\"45 That said, enshrined within the joint TMD R&D project is a
possi-

bility for Japan to exert some political leverage over the U.S. Thus,
Tokyo

may be able to exert stronger influence on the U.S., particularly in
further

strengthening the U.S.-Japan-China security dialogue. Some Chinese ana-

lysts note that for Tokyo to play a restrainer role would be welcomed by

Beijing and state that, if such could be achieved, Beijing would likely
soften

its stance on Japan\'s TMD. They also stated that Tokyo\'s clarification
of the

Taiwan factor within its TMD framework would be a key to gaining an arms

control agreement from China. It must be stipulated, however, that
exclusion

of Taiwan from co-development and co-deployment in Japan\'s TMD system

is not to be confused with how Japan\'s security guidelines are applied
to

Taiwan. That is another matter to be dealt with on a separate basis.

Be as open and transparent as possible about TMD R&D. There is an obvi-

ous need to ensure transparency of the TMD R&D process. The Japanese

government\'s position is to keep the program as transparent as
possible.

Hence, it is fair to say that such measures as partial data releases to
the Chi-

nese could be taken so as to reduce China\'s threat perception level.
One

suggestion is for the U.S. and Japan to publish a joint TMD white paper.

Sensitive information, of course, would not be disclosed, but partial
release

of information could be a constructive confidence-building measure
(CBM).46

Such an overture could be made in exchange for China increasing its
military

transparency; specifically, Beijing could offer a partial data release
of its

missile modernization program and clarify its nuclear doctrine, which

remains highly opaque and ambiguous.

#### The United States federal government should establish and clearly communicate a policy of maintaining its Foreign Military Sales of ballistic missile defense to Japan until Russia ceases development and deployment of nuclear capabilities non-compliant with Russia's treaty obligations and commits to engagement with the United States in pursuit of an end to the Syrian conflict.

the Theater-Strategic Nexus, October 2018,

But [the]{.underline} [forthcoming Missile Defense Review fails to
account for this **theater-strategic nexus** in missile
defense]{.underline}. In its new mission to counter Russian missile
systems in Europe, [the Pentagon assumes that it can **selectively**
battle and win an arms race at the **theater** level]{.underline}. [But
**history** has **repeatedly shown**---from the development of the
**strategic cruise missile**]{.underline}15 [to the **breakdown of the
SALT II agreement**---that the **politics governing** **theater**
missile defenses and nuclear-capable **ICBMs** are **inextricably
bound**]{.underline}.16 [Defending against one]{.underline} kind of
weapon **[necessarily alters]{.underline}** [the significance of and
strategy **surrounding the other**.]{.underline} Conversely, [if an
adversary **fails to distinguish**]{.underline} [between theater and
strategic weapon posturing]{.underline}, **[as Russia
does]{.underline}**, [conflict can **easily breach the nuclear
threshold**]{.underline}.17

The regional-strategic nexus is made possible mainly because
[Russia]{.underline}n media **[rarely distinguishes]{.underline}**
between the capabilities of different U.S. missile defenses. [Although
the ranges and roles of U.S. missile defense systems vary drastically,
from **20-km**]{.underline} [point defenses to **2,500-km** regional
shields]{.underline}, most news articles and statements from [the
Russian government **do not discriminate**]{.underline} **[between the
two]{.underline}**. [Russian media]{.underline} almost [always refer to
a "US **global** missile defense system," which the Russian Foreign
Ministry calls "a dangerous **global** project aimed at establishing
**omnipresent** and overwhelming US **military
superiority**]{.underline}."18

[The White House has]{.underline} in turn **[lambasted]{.underline}**
[Russia for building "**destabilizing** weapons systems . . . in direct
violation of its **treaty obligations**]{.underline}," [but there is no
reason to believe that Russia will **cease** **weapons
development**]{.underline} [in response to **expanding**]{.underline}
[U.S. TMD]{.underline}.19 In fact, expanding and repurposing [TMD only
**vindicates** Russian concerns about U.S. missile defense,]{.underline}
which threatens U.S. national security in two ways.

First, **[doubling down]{.underline}** [on TMD makes it **much easier**
for the Russian **defense industry**]{.underline} [to justify **building
even more strategic weapons**]{.underline}. **[Russian and U.S.
sources]{.underline}** [have assessed that many of Russia's new
strategic weapons unveiled on March 1 are "**nowhere near" ready for
deployment**, and that the **threat** of their development may be **used
as a bargaining chip**]{.underline} [to **negotiate with** the United
States]{.underline}. 20 [Expanding TMD **declines the
gambit**]{.underline}, **[ensuring Russia funnels more resources into
threatening strategic capabilities]{.underline}**---[exactly what the
Pentagon had hoped to avoid.]{.underline}

[The Pentagon should **tread carefully**, lest it]{.underline}
**[invites]{.underline}** [Russia to **develop strategic weapons it has
no method**]{.underline} or intention **[of countering]{.underline}**.

landmark INF Treaty is doomed.\" Asia Times.
<http://www.atimes.com/why-the-landmark-inf-treaty-is-doomed/>

[The]{.underline} Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
(**[INF]{.underline}**) [Treaty is]{.underline} [**heading for its
demise**. While the]{.underline} 1987 [landmark]{.underline} arms
control [agreement has not been]{.underline} [**officially pronounced
dead**, a]{.underline} **[date for the funeral has]{.underline}**
already **[been set]{.underline}**. [On **December 4**]{.underline}, US
Secretary of State Mike **[Pompeo]{.underline}** [announced]{.underline}
that [Russia has **60 days** to return to **compli**ance. **Failing** to
do so will lead the US to trigger the **six-month period of
withdrawal**]{.underline} from the treaty, [making **August 1**
a]{.underline} potential **[turning point]{.underline}** in the history
of arms control. [The announcement did not emerge out of a vacuum. It
came nearly]{.underline} **[five years]{.underline}**
[after]{.underline} the [Obama]{.underline} administration [first
accused Russia of **violating the treaty** and follows years of fraught
relations between Moscow and the West]{.underline}, particularly since
the former's annexation of Crimea in 2014. It raises the grim prospect
of an all-out arms race between the two powers, marking a new low in
their relations. [At the heart of the dispute is Russia's alleged
development and testing of the]{.underline} [**9M729**, a
nuclear-capable ground-launched cruise missile that Washington claims
falls within the INF-prohibited range of between 500 and 5,500
kilometers. While **some**]{.underline} [are]{.underline}
**[hoping]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} an [eleventh-hour
compromise]{.underline}, especially [after Russia called for formal
negotiations, it is]{.underline} **[unlikely the two sides will find a
diplomatic solution to the current deadlock]{.underline}** [within the
**narrowing**]{.underline} 60-day **[window]{.underline}**. [From
**Moscow's** standpoint, it is **Washington**]{.underline} [that has
failed to comply with the treaty. The Kremlin has firmly and routinely
**rejected Washington's allegations**, pointing to the US drone program,
the deployment of the Aegis Ashore missile defense system in Romania,
and the use of decommissioned ICBMs as missile defense targets as
sufficient grounds for its withdrawal]{.underline}. Washington, echoed
by NATO, has denied any wrongdoing. [**It is unclear if Washington is
willing to make an effort to save the agreement**. The US has been
sparing in its efforts to save the treaty, and uncertainty remains
around its **true rationale** for withdrawing. Some blame]{.underline}
John **[Bolton]{.underline}**, Trump's hawkish national security
adviser, who previously toyed with the idea of abrogating the treaty,
for leading the charge against the INF. [Others point to]{.underline}
the burgeoning strategic competition with **[China]{.underline}** as a
likely rationale for Washington's intended withdrawal. [Regardless of
the exact motives, it is clear that the White House views
the]{.underline} current [status quo as]{.underline} **[wholly
untenable]{.underline}** -- [and]{.underline} perhaps [**rightly so**.
In addition to having violated its INF engagements, Russia is undergoing
a complex and expensive **modernization**]{.underline} [of its arsenal
of]{.underline} **[strategic]{.underline}** [nuclear weapons and
delivery systems, which US decision-makers regard with growing
concern]{.underline}. With Washington worried about remaining the only
one complying with the INF treaty, we should expect it to stand firm. UN
Security Council resolution [With neither the US nor Russia willing to
budge, it is **highly unlikely that either side will readily make any
meaningful conciliatory gestures**. Russia's tabling last month of a
face-saving -- albeit promptly rejected -- UN Security Council
resolution calling on both sides to fulfill their treaty obligations
serves little more than to proverbially **knock the ball back into
Washington's court**. The gesture placed the onus on Washington to
reiterate its commitment to the treaty days after it]{.underline}
[**threatened to withdraw**, affording Moscow an easy reason
to]{.underline} **[blame the US]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} the
current [deadlock]{.underline}. [Tellingly, Russia has refused to allow
the US to]{.underline} **[inspect the missile]{.underline}** at the
heart of the dispute, [immediately]{.underline} **[ruling out a key
concession]{.underline}** [that Washington would hope for in future
negotiations. For]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir [Putin, full
**disclosure** of the missile would be tantamount to]{.underline}
**[confirming US accusations]{.underline}** [that Russia is in blatant
violation of its arms control obligations. This would likely further
deteriorate Russia's]{.underline} [**tarnished rep**utation]{.underline}
[on the global scene, and could possibly open the door to a fresh round
of Western]{.underline} [**sanctions**. Amid recent economic stagnation
and lowering approval ratings, this scenario is one the Kremlin **cannot
afford**. With Moscow unlikely to bow to US pressure, and Washington
equally unlikely to alter its demands, it is of the **utmost
importance** to **prepare -- now rather than later -- for a world
without the treaty**]{.underline}. [A **first priority** should be
**damage control**]{.underline}. Washington and Moscow must prevent the
treaty's collapse from eroding the broader commitment to the
non-proliferation architecture. This means reaffirming commitments to
existing accords, such as the 2011 New START agreement, which caps the
size of their missile arsenal to 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads.
Washington could also give reassurances that it would continue upholding
its non-INF obligations, even if the INF Treaty collapses, and signal
its desire to extend the New START treaty beyond its current 2021
sunset. [Policymakers in both capitals must **resist a return to a Cold
War mentality**]{.underline}. This means resisting the strategic
temptation, already expressed by both states, to use the collapse of the
INF Treaty as a free-for-all call for deploying land-based missiles
across Europe. The US withdrawal need not bring the world back to an era
in which nuclear weapons are again part of the strategic calculations of
global powers, be they Russia, the US or even China. [Amid **severe
tensions**]{.underline} [between Russia and the West, any]{.underline}
**[provocative first steps]{.underline}** [would **multiply** the
**risks** of triggering a **new arms race**]{.underline} [between the
two adversaries and expand the possible consequences of **strategic
miscalc**ulation, thus putting]{.underline} the security of
**[millions]{.underline}** of European citizens **[at
risk]{.underline}**.

International Studies (CSIS) and a diplomat, Ballistic Missile Defense:
Proceed With Caution, 2017,
<https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2017-11/features/ballistic-missile-defense-proceed-caution/>

[At present]{.underline}, [the notion of **capping** missile
defense]{.underline} development [is not being explored by the United
States]{.underline}, in part on dubious grounds [that]{.underline}
missile defense activity is morally legitimate. Such an assertion [is
not justified in theory, nor is it effective in practice]{.underline}.
Although primarily a defensive concept, [missile defenses
support]{.underline} [offensive missions on the theater level and
shapes]{.underline} the [evolution of other powers' deterrence
strategies]{.underline} to an extent. Moreover, [it is a **powerful
diplomatic irritant**]{.underline}, [which makes it a **strong
bargaining chip** in]{.underline} **[any negotiation]{.underline}**.

[It is uncertain what **price China and Russia would pay** to
**cap**]{.underline} [U.S. missile defense development. Their
willingness to pay a high price may **decline over time**]{.underline}
[because both]{.underline} countries [are becoming increasingly
efficient]{.underline} themselves [in this]{.underline} emerging
[domain]{.underline}. [Hence, it is not certain that time will always be
an asset for the United States]{.underline}, especially as China's
funding potential grows. [Yet, the **immediate interest**]{.underline}
[for China and Russia is to **negotiate in good faith**]{.underline}. [A
refusal on their part to engage]{.underline} in serious discussions
[would discredit their narrative about a U.S. military
buildup]{.underline} in their respective regions.

[Additionally, China and Russia would **benefit** from
negotiating]{.underline} [because a strategic arms race on missile
defenses would risk disrupting]{.underline} [China's deterrence strategy
and would certainly strain Russia's]{.underline} [economic capabilities.
With the **United States, China, and Russia on board**]{.underline},

Second, [expanding TMD would contradict U.S. efforts to bring Russia
**back into compliance with the**]{.underline} Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces (**[INF]{.underline}**) Treaty, [a **cornerstone** **arms
control** agreement]{.underline}. [The Trump administration's INF
strategy is based on **coercing Moscow**]{.underline} **[to the
negotiating table]{.underline}** through economic, diplomatic, and
military measures. However, [expanding TMD **imperils**
negotiations]{.underline} in two ways. For one, [the entire point of a
strategy based on coercive diplomacy is to **change the behavior** of an
adversary]{.underline}. [In this case, the prerequisite for behavior
change is to rekindle dialogue]{.underline}. [Vindicating]{.underline}
[Russian concerns over missile defense only]{.underline} strengthens
anti-American resolve and **[eliminates any incentive to
negotiate]{.underline}** [by convincing Russian defense hawks that they
are right]{.underline} not to trust the United States. Second,
[**expanding TMD** **removes the most valuable chit from the negotiating
table**]{.underline}. [Next to sanctions, U.S. missile
defenses]{.underline} in Europe [are]{.underline} probably **[the top

Problem.\" In Depth News.

[Without the treaty]{.underline}, already **[severe
tensions]{.underline}** [will]{.underline} **[grow]{.underline}** [as
Washington considers deployment of new]{.underline} intermediate-range
**[missiles in Europe]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} perhaps elsewhere
and [Russia considers]{.underline} **[increasing 9M729
deployments]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[other new
systems]{.underline}**. [These nuclear-capable weapons, if deployed
again, would be able to strike targets **deep inside Russia** and in
**western Europe**. Their]{.underline} **[short time-to-target
capability]{.underline}** [increases the risk of]{.underline}
**[miscalc]{.underline}**ulation [in a **crisis**]{.underline}. Any
nuclear attack on Russia involving U.S. intermediate-range,
nuclear-armed missiles based in Europe [could provoke a]{.underline}
**[massive Russian nuclear]{.underline}** counter[**strike** on
**Europe** and on the]{.underline} **[U.S. homeland]{.underline}**. In
delivering the U.S. ultimatum on the treaty, Pompeo expressed "hope"
that Russia will "change course" and return to compliance. [Hope that
Russia will]{.underline} **[suddenly admit fault]{.underline}** and
eliminate its 9M729 system [is]{.underline} **[not a serious
strategy]{.underline}**, and it is not one on which NATO leaders can
rely. Instead, NATO members should insist that the United States and
Russia redouble their sporadic INF Treaty discussions, agree to meet in
a formal setting, and put forward proposals for how to resolve issues of
mutual concern about the treaty. Unfortunately, U.S. officials have
refused thus far to take up Russia's offer to discuss "any mutually
beneficial proposals that take into account the interests and concerns
of both parties." That is a serious mistake. Failure by both sides to
take diplomatic engagement more seriously since the 9M729 missile was
first tested five years ago has bought us to this point. [Barring an
unlikely 11th-hour diplomatic breakthrough, however, the INF Treaty's
**days are numbered**. Doing]{.underline} **[nothing]{.underline}** [is
**not a viable option**]{.underline}. With the treaty possibly
disappearing later this year, [it is not too soon to consider how to
head off a dangerous and costly new missile race in Europe]{.underline}.
One option would be for NATO to declare, as a bloc, that none of them
will field any INF Treaty-prohibited missiles or any equivalent new
nuclear capabilities in Europe so long as Russia does not field
treaty-prohibited systems that can reach NATO territory. This would
require Russia to remove those 9M729 missiles that have been deployed in
western Russia. This would also mean forgoing Trump's plans for a new
ground-launched, INF Treaty-prohibited missile. Because the United
States and its NATO allies can already deploy air- and sea-launched
systems that can threaten key Russian targets, there is no need for such
a system. Key allies, including Germany, have already declared their
opposition to stationing new intermediate-range missiles in Europe. [In
the]{.underline} [**absence of the INF Treaty**, a]{.underline}nother
[possible approach would be to negotiate a]{.underline} **[new
agreement]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} [**verifiably prohibits
g**round-**l**aunched, intermediate-range **b**allistic or **c**ruise
**m**issile**s**]{.underline} armed with nuclear warheads. As a recent
United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research study explains, [the
sophisticated verification procedures and technologies **already in
place**]{.underline} [under]{.underline} the 2010 New Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty (**[New START]{.underline}**) [can be applied with
almost]{.underline} **[no modification]{.underline}** [to **verify** the
absence of]{.underline} nuclear warheads deployed on [shorter-range
missiles. Such an approach would require]{.underline}
**[additional]{.underline}** declarations and
**[inspections]{.underline}** [of any ground-launched INF Treaty-range
systems]{.underline}. To be of lasting value, such a framework would
require that Moscow and Washington agree to extend New START, which is
now scheduled to expire in 2021.

### Japan -- Military Presence

#### The US should leverage reductiongs in military presence in Japan for non-aggression from China

<https://thehill.com/opinion/international/352035-its-time-to-demilitarize-east-asia>,
Accessed 7/12/19 DDI-GN)

Meanwhile, the Japanese government should renew its support for its
pacifist constitution and the ideology that underlies it. [Ultimately,
Japan must double down on its commitment to peace, and open a path to
removing U.S.]{.underline}military bases [from Japan in exchange for
enforceable pledges of non-aggression from its neighbors.]{.underline}
[U.S. withdrawal from East Asia would, of course, enhance China\'s power
in the region]{.underline}. But **[if that power is being used to
preserve peace and stability, as it has been over many centuries, that
would not necessarily be a strategic disaster for the
U.S.]{.underline}** Indeed, [China would likely offer significant
concessions and security guarantees in exchange for a major reduction in
the US military presence in the region.]{.underline} The impasse in East
Asia needs a radical solution. [America\'s web of military obligations
in East Asia is far more of a danger than an enhancement to U.S.
security. The remilitarization of Japan would be a further step in the
wrong direction.]{.underline}

[Americans and Japanese have long debated the utility of America's
permanent military presence in the island prefecture of
Okinawa]{.underline}, which [hosts roughly half of the 54,000 American

the election of [Okinawa's new governor,]{.underline} Denny Tamaki, who

Bay area]{.underline}, **[instead advocating for the complete removal of
the base]{.underline}**. [Tamaki]{.underline}, himself the son of an
American serviceman, [recently traveled to America to make his case for
reducing the American military presence in Okinawa and the specific
removal of U.S. Marines from the prefecture]{.underline}. **[Many have
previously called for the U.S. military to leave the island
altogether.]{.underline}** While **[America has far too many military
bases which have become redundant]{.underline}**, **[costly and
counterproductive]{.underline}** to America's national interests, the
bases in Okinawa remain a vital component of America's grand strategy in
East Asia. The American military presence on the island, and
specifically U.S. Marines, play an important role in establishing
American power projection in a critically important region that is home
to roughly 60 percent of the global population. [Still, in the interest
of preserving the long-term sustainability of the American presence in
Okinawa, the United States should work with the local government to
better address the valid complaints of the Japanese people regarding the
role of the American military in Okinawa.]{.underline}

### Korea -- Grand Bargain

#### A grand bargain between the US, China, South Korea, Japan, and Russia effectively resolves tensions in north east Asia. 

**[Kim 17]{.underline}** (Patricia M, the Stanton Nuclear Security
Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, "A Grand Bargain for the
Long Game on the Korean Peninsula," Council on Foreign Relations,
November 1, 2017,
<https://www.cfr.org/blog/grand-bargain-long-game-korean-peninsula-0>)

[President Trump should]{.underline} use his inaugural [trip to
Asia](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/10/16/statement-press-secretary-president-donald-j-trumps-upcoming-travel-asia)
this month to [begin exploring a grand bargain with]{.underline} the
major powers of the region---[China, South Korea, Japan, and
Russia---that outlines mutually acceptable scenarios on the Korean
Peninsula, and can serve as the basis for extended diplomatic
coordination between the five parties]{.underline}. [The
purpose]{.underline} of the grand bargain [would be]{.underline}
twofold. First[, to assure all five parties, especially Beijing, that
joining Washington to pressure North Korea, even at the risk of the Kim
regime's collapse, will not sway the regional balance of power in a
manner that undercuts any one state's fundamental
interests.]{.underline} [And]{.underline} second, [to send a message to
Pyongyang that it can no longer rely on the strategic gaps between its
neighbors to continue its
"[byungjin](https://www.38north.org/2017/07/hferon071817/)" policy of
pursuing both nuclear weapons and economic development. The grand
bargain]{.underline}, which could be formalized in a joint statement,
[should begin with the premise that none of the parties seek North
Korea's collapse, and]{.underline} that all [are willing to extend a
security guarantee and assist with its integration into the global
economy]{.underline}, in conjunction [with concrete steps by Pyongyang
to freeze and ultimately abandon its nuclear program.]{.underline} But
the deal should also include a clear commitment that all five parties
will continue to enforce and increase sanctions until North Korea takes
such steps. [The grand bargain will also need to address what would
happen if the Kim regime were to collapse]{.underline} as an unintended
result of the pressure campaign. [One]{.underline} reasonable [plan is
to have the South Korean government take charge of the unification of
the Korean Peninsula, with the assistance of U.S. and Chinese troops to
secure nuclear material and ensure an orderly transition in the
immediate aftermath. The plan should also include a
commitment]{.underline} by all parties [to assist in the stabilization
of a unified and neutral Korea]{.underline} that can enjoy equitable and
coordinated relationships with all of the powers in the region. Striking
such [a deal will]{.underline} not be easy by any means, and [will have
to address conflicting interests]{.underline} and mutual skepticism on
all sides. [First, the United States and South Korea will need to have a
serious conversation on]{.underline} whether and [how they are prepared
to modify their alliance]{.underline} in the case of unification, in
order [to gain China's support for a unified Korean Peninsula led by the
South Korean government.]{.underline} President [Trump will]{.underline}
also [have to]{.underline} find a way to [persuade the other parties
that the U.S. government will stand by the provisions in the
deal]{.underline}, despite a poor track record of pursuing regime change
and wavering on past commitments like the Iran deal. [And President Xi
Jinping will also need to assure all parties]{.underline}, especially
South Korea[, that China would respect the independence of a unified
Korean Peninsula, especially one with a modified security relationship
with the United States]{.underline}, should such a state arise.
Addressing such challenges will be tough to say the least, but not
impossible, with creative and persistent diplomacy. [The time is ripe to
strike a grand bargain. Asian leaders and citizens are increasingly
worried about the prospects for war in their neighborhood, and would
welcome a deal that lays out a diplomatic path forward with clear ground
rules on the Korean Peninsula]{.underline}. Perhaps most significantly,
[Beijing, which has traditionally sheltered Pyongyang, is increasingly
frustrated with its wayward ally, and faces [growing
calls](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/china-bans-north-korea-iron-lead-coal-imports-as-part-of-un-sanctions/2017/08/14/a0ce4cb0-80ca-11e7-82a4-920da1aeb507_story.html?utm_term=.91317ede1e29)
by Chinese political elites to reevaluate whether its North Korea policy
is still in China's best interests.]{.underline} And now that President
Xi has emerged an even stronger leader after the Nineteenth Party
Congress, he should have more political space to partake in grand
deal-making. Finally, it is imperative to lock down Russia into an
agreement before it expands its minor
[spoiler-role](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-russia-analysis/russia-throws-north-korea-lifeline-to-stymie-regime-change-idUSKBN1C91X2)
of helping North Korea flout sanctions. President Trump takes pride in
his ability to make deals, and he should use his upcoming trip to lay
the groundwork to strike a grand bargain with his regional partners.
[While any deal is unlikely to result in immediate denuclearization, an
extended campaign of economic pressure and clear diplomatic assurances
could one day lead to wariness and changed minds among North Korea's
elites, who now have more access to outside information and creature
comforts than ever before.]{.underline} And if the Kim regime collapses
before such a point, [a grand bargain will serve as a valuable blueprint
for the way forward on the Korean Peninsula.]{.underline}

treaty.]{.underline} Introducing the idea in 2016, China's Foreign
[Minister Wang Yi proposed that, "The two \[tracks\] can be
negotiated]{.underline} in parallel, implemented in steps [and resolved
with reference to each other."]{.underline} 30 In [July 2017, the
Foreign Ministries of China and Russia issued a "Joint Statement on the
Korean Peninsula Issue," providing a basic roadmap for how negotiations
might proceed. They proposed that "the conflicting countries" start
negotiations by asserting "common principles in their relations,
including the non-use of force, the renunciation of aggression, peaceful
coexistence and determination to do all they can to denuclearize the
Korean Peninsula]{.underline}," as well as a commitment to a
comprehensive settlement of all issues, including the nuclear issue.
[The goal of negotiations, they proposed, should be a "peace and
security mechanism" for the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia more
broadly, with normalization of relations among the parties to
follow.]{.underline}31 On April 5, 2018, meeting reporters with Russian
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Wang Yi said both he and Lavrov welcomed
"the apparent improvement in the situation of the Korean Peninsula."
[Wang renewed China's call for a "dual track" approach to negotiations,
which he said would need to employ "phased, synchronized, and packaged
solutions." Negotiations toward a peace agreement, Wang said, should
adopt "an incremental approach" and be premised on
denuclearization.]{.underline} 32

the North Korean leadership to leave power, it would be very helpful to
offer them asylum in China, permanently protecting them from criminal
trials or reprisals.17 [South Korea would have to agree to reunification
with the North on the condition that it immediately dismantles the North
Korean nuclear program under full international inspections and
reaffirms Korea's adherence to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) as a
non-nuclear weapons state. The United States would have to agree to
reduce its role in Korea. It would almost certainly have to withdraw its
military forces from united Korea, and possibly scale back]{.underline}
or eliminate [its alliance]{.underline} relationship as well. Korea
could be "neutralized," much as Austria was early in the Cold War, to
remove it from the superpower competition.18 [The key quid pro quo is
Chinese termination of support for the North in exchange for U.S.
withdrawal from the South]{.underline}.

#### Say yes

[On the Korean Peninsula, Goldstein makes the case for coequal Chinese
and American leadership in forging a durable peace.]{.underline} [His
analysis of Chinese writing]{.underline} on Korea [is
enlightening]{.underline}. Chinese intellectuals see the South Korean
military and defense industries as models to emulate. They do not view
Seoul's evolving military posture as a threat. At the same time, [more
and more Chinese analysts have called for a reevaluation of Beijing's
stance]{.underline} toward Pyongyang. Goldstein, however, actually
encourages Beijing to take steps that would enhance Pyongyang's
security, including a reinvigoration of the 1961 Sino-North Korean
Defense Treaty and a symbolic troop presence in North Korea. Given the
vast disparity of economic power and conventional military capabilities
on the peninsula, Pyongyang's anxieties are understandable. A token
Chinese military presence and stronger commitment to upholding security
and stability on the peninsula could preclude the need for North Korea
to take radical steps to demonstrate its will to fight. Further steps on
[the cooperation spiral propose that Washington]{.underline} inaugurate
diplomatic relations with North Korea and [withdraw a large number of
troops from South Korea while still maintaining its alliance with
Seoul.]{.underline} China, for its part, should oversee North Korea's
complete and verified nuclear disarmament. The most salient problem on
the Korean Peninsula, Goldstein concludes, is North Korea's stark
vulnerability and insecurity. To achieve disarmament, North Korea must
first be made more secure, and only "China has the means and incentive
to aid in this endeavor" (p. 218).

South Korea's Current Approach to a Peace Treaty [South Korean President
Moon has presented the goal of signing a peace treaty as a key part of
his "peace and prosperity" approach to North Korea]{.underline}.
According to a December 2017 [policy brochure published by the South
Korean Ministry of Unification, the first of three goals of this policy
is "Resolution of the North Korean Nuclear Issue and Establishment of
Permanent Peace.]{.underline}" In pursuing this goal, [the Moon
government "\...aim\[s\] to substitute the past sixty years of an
unstable armistice with]{.underline} a permanent peace regime, to ensure
[peace in a practical and institutional manner."]{.underline}27 In a
July 2017 speech in Berlin announcing his strategy toward North Korea,
[Moon spoke about the importance]{.underline} he places on a peace
treaty: my Government will work towards establishing a permanent peace
regime. The Korean Peninsula has been under an armistice for more than
60 years since 1953. [Firm peace cannot be realized under an unstable
armistice system\.... In order to establish a permanent peace structure
on the Korean Peninsula, we need to conclude a peace treaty with the
participation of relevant countries, and formally end the
war.]{.underline} Through a comprehensive approach on the North Korean
nuclear issue and establishing a peace regime on the Korean Peninsula,
[my Government will pursue the conclusion of a peace treaty along with
complete denuclearization]{.underline}.28 [Moon also has emphasized that
South Korea should take the lead in inter-Korean relations, including
the unification process]{.underline}, though he has been vague about
what this might mean in practice.29 Moon has linked his peace regime
proposal to progress on denuclearization

### \--Reciprocity Key

#### Partial Korea withdrawal can get concessions from China -- but reciprocal coordination is key

**[Goldstein]{.underline}**, associate professor and founding director,
China Maritime Studies Institute, U.S. Naval War College, May
**[2015]{.underline}**

(Lyle, *Meeting China Halfway*, pg. 212-213)

Washington's move 2 on the Korean Peninsula: The United States should
make a symbolic withdrawal of forces to show goodwill. [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has]{.underline} already
[engaged in numerous force reductions on the Korean Peninsula over the
last several decades]{.underline}, and most recently during the George
W. Bush administration, when additional ground forces were needed in the
Middle East and in response to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's
initiative to "transform" the force. Major reductions of US forces had
already occurred under presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter. In the
past, these reductions (combined with enhanced US-China cooperation)
have resulted in progress in inter-Korean negotiations. 78 Recent
efforts at withdrawals have focused on the widening gap between South
Korea's military capabilities and those of North Korea. According to one
mid-2012 assessment, "Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair
said the gap between North and South Korean power had become
'overwhelmingly great' and 'prospects for reversal' remote. Blair's
successor as director of national intelligence, James Clapper, gave
similar testimony last year." 79 At this stage, a purely symbolic
withdrawal--- of perhaps 1,000 to 2,000 personnel--- would be
appropriate, given China's promotion of a four-power naval patrol, as
noted above. [Previous US troop withdrawals have been]{.underline}
"[demand centric]{.underline}" (e.g., the pull of Iraq or Afghanistan)
[and have not been **coordinated effectively with Beijing**]{.underline}
and Pyongyang in order [to **gain reciprocal concessions**]{.underline}.
As a carefully planned step in a process of step-by-step compromise,
[such a symbolic effort would have a substantial chance of
success.]{.underline}

### Korea -- QPQ for Withdrawal

#### North Korea presently exhibits a greater threat to global nuclear security than U.S.-China aggression; we must condition a removal of military presence in South Korea on China to collaborate with the PRC to counter North Korean nuclear potential

Todd **Rosenblum**, 7-18-**2017**, \"How to persuade China to abandon
North Korea,\" Agenda; Todd M. Rosenblum was a delegate to the
U.S.-China-South Korea-North Korea Four Party Peace Talks in the 1990s.
He was a senior official at the Departments of Defense and Homeland
Security for the Obama administration from 2009 to 2015. He is a
nonresident fellow at The Atlantic Council and serves on the Defense
Science Board Task Force on Homeland Defense. 

As **[North Korea rapidly develops the ability to strike the mainland
United States with a nuclear missile]{.underline}**, the Trump
administration has adopted a well-known strategy: demand China do more
to pressure Pyongyang. But [American presidents have pressed Beijing to
rein in North Korea for the past 25 years with little
success]{.underline}. There's no reason to believe Trump's efforts will
end any differently. **[Without China pulling the plug on North Korea,
the crisis will not abate]{.underline}**. The **[U.S.,]{.underline}**
then, could soon **[face two horrible options: start a catastrophic war
that would kill hundreds of thousands of South Koreans or live with a
nuclear-armed North Korea capable of striking Washington]{.underline}**.
It's a frightening possibility, one that Trump and other top **[U.S.
policymakers must]{.underline}** do everything to avoid. But if we
really want to [block the North's nuclear program without another Korean
War]{.underline}, it requires us to think carefully about what could
actually **[persuade China to cut off its support for the North Korean
regime]{.underline}**. And that leads us to a previously unthinkable
idea: giving real consideration to **[removing all American troops from
a unified peninsula in exchange for China proactively leading the
transition to a unified Korea]{.underline}**. Though it has been
unthinkable for years---and still may be---**[such a deal would also
create a kind of leverage that nothing else has]{.underline}**. The
United States has spent more than a quarter century imploring China to
pressure North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions and be a
responsible member of the international community, dating as far back as
the 1990s when I was a delegate to the Four Party Peace Talk for the
Korean Peninsula. We have tried sticks---[diplomatic and economic
sanctions---against China and we have tried honey, praising Beijing for
half steps it has taken to pressure Pyongyang. We have sought an
international consensus through the United Nations and have made China a
co-equal, central actor in peace and security talks. Nothing has
persuaded Beijing to abandon its lifeline to the North Korean
state.]{.underline} China has taken a few steps toward reining in North
Korea, such as cutting off coal exports earlier this year. But it has
not wavered in its view that a unified, Western-oriented peninsula would
be far more threatening to its core national security interests than
anything the North Korean state has done or will do. Unification, China
believes, likely would end with the U.S. military on its border, an
unacceptable risk. In turn, China has refused to take the necessary
steps to really damage the North Korean regime, such as closing its
border, blocking the flow of North Korean worker remittances, or
enforcing a blockade against North Korean shipping. After Trump entered
office, his administration **[quickly realized the threat posed by North
Korea and has made it a top issue]{.underline}**, even [offering to
relax some of his trade demands if Chinese President Xi Jinping would
offer more help with North Korea.]{.underline} But in Trump's first six
months, little has changed. Pyongyang has continued to test missiles,
including recently conducting its first successful ICBM test, while
China has continued to protect the regime of Kim Jong Un---as Trump
himself acknowledged earlier this month when he tweeted, "so much for
China working with us." Perhaps, then, we need to ask ourselves some
very hard questions about what we are really willing to give to get
Chinese support for fully ending its backing of the North Korean regime.
What will it take for Beijing to change its calculus on unification? Are
there things China believes worth it to give up on its buffer state
against the United States? The answer is yes. In fact, many [national
security experts know what the Chinese would demand: **China wants the
U.S. military off the peninsula**]{.underline}. South Korea is a vital
defense, security and trade partner of the United States. There are
nearly 30,000 U.S. troops stationed on South Korean soil, down from more
than 300,000 Americans who were stationed in Korea in 1951 but still a
significant number. The U.S. and South Korea are also treaty allies;
Washington is obligated to defend South Korea if attacked[. **Here's how
a deal**]{.underline} could **[work]{.underline}**: **[The U.S. would
remove all 30,000 troops from South Korea and close its military
bases]{.underline}**. We could even consider ending our treaty with
South Korea**[. In return, China would not only cease its support for
North Korea but help end the Kim dynasty altogether, leaving behind a
unified, democratic Korea that swears off nuclear weapons. The U.S. and
China would jointly engage South Korea on its absorption of the
North]{.underline}**, since South Korea knows the cost of German
reunification and is appropriately leery of reintegrating 25 million
starved, information-deprived people into a modern state. Is
[eliminating the U.S. military presence on the peninsula a fair price
for China finally---and fully---pulling the plug on North
Kore]{.underline}a? It's a difficult question with huge security and
economic implications, and I'm honestly not sure about the answer. The
rapid fall of the Kim regime isn't even guaranteed under such a deal and
there's a real possibility that **[a unified Korea would align more
closely with China than the U.S]{.underline}**., undermining our
strength in the region. The U.S.-Japan-South Korean alliance is always
under stress, and ending it would take away a core pillar of U.S.
policy. But unlike our previous strategies on North Korea, this one
would at least have a **[real shot at advancing our strategic interests
while avoiding a bloody and destabilizing war]{.underline}**. That's
because there's a lot for Beijing to like in it.

#### Withdrawing US military aid to South Korea key to DPRK denuclearization leverage -sends a signal ending US hostile policy

**Bandow,** senior fellow at the Cato Institute, specializing in foreign
policy and civil liberties, **2018**

(Doug, "Offer to Withdraw America\'s Troops from South Korea to Seal a
Nuclear Deal with the North," The National Interest, April 14,
<https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-skeptics/offer-withdraw-americas-troops-south-korea-seal-nuclear-deal-25351>,
Accessed 7/12/19 DDI_GN)

[What might satisfy the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea?]{.underline} **[The regime's representatives regularly speak of
ending America's "hostile policy."]{.underline}** During my visit
officials also pointed to Washington's "military threats" and "nuclear
threats." Last July, the Korean Central News Agency reported that Kim
said "[the DPRK would neither put its nukes and ballistic rockets on the
table of negotiations . . . unless the U.S. hostile policy and nuclear
threat to the DPRK are definitely terminated]{.underline}." [In the
past, Pyongyang has proposed negotiation of a peace treaty to formally
end the conflict, and cancellation of the annual U.S.--South Korean
military exercises]{.underline}. Washington could add diplomatic
recognition, agree to a nonaggression pact and promise no first use of
nuclear weapons. No doubt sanctions would have to end. The DPRK also
likely would expect aid, not only from the Republic of Korea, but also
from Japan, which accompanied its recognition of the ROK with de facto
reparations for its colonial rule. The United States might offer
humanitarian assistance as well as support the North's membership in
multilateral development banks. Still, all of these are essentially
paper guarantees. Once North Korea abandons its hard-won deterrent, all
it would have in return would be promises. Ukrainians discovered the
limited value of Washington's good wishes in the Budapest Memorandum,
signed by the United States, Russia and other governments, after
relinquishing nuclear weapons left behind when the Soviet Union
dissolved. Moreover, Washington could make additional demands---over
human rights and democratic practices, for instance---and threaten to
ignore or revoke any guarantees given if Pyongyang did not comply.
Moreover, none of the foregoing provisions would prevent a subsequent
attempt at regime change. The DPRK would retain a sizeable but decrepit
conventional force; however, no nonnuclear power has been able to stand
up against the U.S. military. Washington easily ousted governments in
Grenada, Panama, Haiti, Afghanistan and Iraq; imposed a geopolitical
settlement on Bosnia; and dismembered Serbia. Even more, el-Qaddafi's
gruesome fate, recorded for the world to see, illustrated Washington's
willingness to ignore past promises. Indeed, Saddam Hussein could make a
similar complaint: the Reagan administration supported him after he
invaded Iran and George H. W. Bush's ambassador in Baghdad indicated
that Kuwait's fate was of little concern in Washington. He didn't expect
to end up on the wrong end of a U.S. invasion. Moreover, President
Trump's behavior does not give confidence that he would keep his word.
Nor would a future president feel it necessary to live up to a deal made
by President Trump. After all, he has spent most of his first fourteen
months in office repudiating trade agreements made by his predecessors
and working to kill the nuclear accord with Iran. He is also threatening
to escalate U.S. involvement in Syria, and toyed with military
intervention in Venezuela. Incoming secretary of state Mike Pompeo
recently hinted that he supported regime change in Pyongyang. [How
trusting will be the DPRK's supreme leader, who has been exceedingly
ruthless---at least measured by public executions of former aides---in
preserving his rule? Probably not very.]{.underline} China and Russia
could offer security guarantees, but the North always maintained its
independence from both of its dominating neighbors. Indeed, Kim appears
sensitive to the possibility that his frenemies in Beijing might want to
replace him: in 2013 he executed his uncle, who was the regime's chief
interlocutor with China, and last year he presumably ordered the
execution of his half brother, who could have been used by Beijing as
the frontman for a more docile regime. Kim might prefer not to rely on a
potentially overbearing China for protection. Instead, **[Kim could
demand more from the administration---most likely the end of
Washington's alliance with the South and removal of U.S. troops from the
peninsula]{.underline}**. [The North long has denounced the ROK as a
puppet regime and insisted that America stay out of Korean
affairs.]{.underline} [While the United States replies that its force
presence is defensive, those troops and bases would be useful in any
military action against a weakened DPRK]{.underline}. Indeed, **[from
Pyongyang's standpoint, withdrawal would seem a reasonable price for
yielding both nukes and long-range missiles.]{.underline}** However, the
possibility of North Korea making such a demand worries some Korea
analysts. For instance, Thomas Wright of the Brookings Institution
complained that doing so would trade away "one of America's most
important alliances" and "signal that the United States cares little for
its friends and is only concerned about direct threats to the homeland."
Yet [the alliance is important primarily to the extent that it advances
America's security, not to the extent that it subsidizes one of
America's many prosperous and populous defense clients]{.underline}. And
[direct threats to the American homeland are precisely the dangers
against which Washington should be most alert]{.underline}, since they
matter far more than threats against friendly nations, especially those
able to defend themselves. Before negotiations begin, Washington
decisionmakers should ponder their priorities. Which is more important,
getting rid of North Korea's nuclear weapons or keeping U.S. forces on
the peninsula? Administration officials might wish to do both. And maybe
it will be possible to do so. But **[an American withdrawal would be the
single most effective step to reduce the likelihood of a future U.S.
attempt at regime coercion or change. And that would be the best way to
fulfill Kim's reported condition for denuclearization, that "the
military threat to the North was eliminated and its security
guaranteed."]{.underline}** Obviously, the [United States would retain
substantial military assets aground and afloat elsewhere in the
region]{.underline}. (Kim conceivably could insist that American troops
leave the region entirely and even that the United States, China and
Russia also denuclearize, a possibility suggested by one of my
interlocutors in Pyongyang. But this would move beyond the realm of the
possible, as Pyongyang would know. That would demonstrate that Kim was
not serious about negotiation.) Nevertheless, **[backing away militarily
would symbolically turn the region's future over to its members. It
would be harder for an American president to make the case for military
action if there was little connection,]{.underline}** let alone threat,
[to America]{.underline}. While the United States could intervene
without an alliance, there would be neither a treaty commitment to
ensure attention nor a troop trip wire to trigger action.

#### North Korea interprets Korean denuclearization as the suspension of US military presence and aid -- represents key leverage

[For Pyongyang,]{.underline} "**[denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula" and the "complete denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula]{.underline}**" -- the operative phrases in the joint
statement -- meant what they have always meant for the DPRK: [the
elimination of the "threat" posed by the United States, its alliance
with the ROK, its military presence on and around the Korean Peninsula,
the nuclear umbrella the U.S. extends over the ROK and
Japan,]{.underline} **[and the strategic and tactical military assets
that America could bring to bear against North Korea in a
conflict]{.underline}**. In an important sense, "[denuclearization of
the Korean Peninsula" means the elimination of America's ability to wage
war against North Korea and the neutering of the U.S. military
deterrent.]{.underline} Despite this radical difference in
interpretation, [the U.S. president agreed to include North Korea's
language in the joint statement]{.underline} -- [a remarkable
concession]{.underline} since the meaning of these words was well known
to U.S. negotiators. President Trump also agreed that the joint
statement would require only that the DPRK "work toward the complete
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula." [Kim Jong Un was surely eager
to affix his name to a statement that both affirmed the DPRK's
definition of "denuclearization]{.underline}" and required little
concrete action on North's part. 5

#### North Korea feels US military presence pressured it to develop nukes -- willing to negotiate over decreasing it

(Choe, "U.S. and South Korea Sign Deal on Shared Defense Costs," The New

**[North Korea has long campaigned for the troops' withdrawal, arguing
that the American military threat had forced it to develop nuclear
weapons.]{.underline}** At the Vietnam meeting, Mr. [Trump is hoping for
concrete and verifiable progress toward denuclearizing
North]{.underline} [Korea. The 8.2 percent increase falls far short of
Mr. Trump's demand, but it is still a major concession for
Seoul.]{.underline} When South Korea signed its last cost-sharing deal
in 2014, it agreed to a 5.8 percent increase over 2013. Under that deal,
South Korea's contribution increased only 1 percent each year from 2015
to 2018, in keeping with domestic inflation rates. South Korea had also
wanted another multiyear deal, to avoid having to negotiate every year.
Still, the new one-year deal helps alleviate, even if briefly, concern
that Mr. Trump might put the future of American troops in South Korea on
the table in the talks with Mr. Kim. [Mr. Trump has often questioned the
value of stationing American troops abroad, repeatedly demanding that
South Korea and Japan pay more for the defense they
provide.]{.underline} In an interview aired on CBS News on Feb. 3, Mr.
[Trump again complained that keeping American troops in South Korea was
"very expensive" but said he had no plans to bring them
home.]{.underline} "Maybe someday. I mean, who knows," he said. "But I
have no plans. I've never even discussed removing them." But [South
Koreans are well aware of Mr. Trump's unpredictability.]{.underline}
Emerging from his first summit meeting with Mr. Kim in Singapore last
June, [Mr. Trump announced he would suspend military exercises on the
Korean Peninsula, calling them "tremendously expensive" and "very
provocative." North Korea has long objected to the drills, and many
South Koreans were shocked that Mr. Trump would make such a significant
concession in return for Mr. Kim's vague promise to "work toward
complete denuclearization."]{.underline} After the June meeting, Mr.
Trump boasted that he had "largely solved" the North Korean nuclear
crisis. But talks have since stalled over how to implement the Singapore
agreement. Analysts say **[Mr. Kim may eventually push for a withdrawal
of American troops, in the name of building peace and winning security
guarantees for his regime]{.underline}**. After his Singapore meeting
with Mr. Kim, [Mr. Trump said he wanted to "get our soldiers out" of
South Korea "at some point."]{.underline}

In the past several years and particularly [under Kim

Korea]{.underline} long has [insisted that]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} [nuclear issue cannot be settled until the United
States ends its "nuclear threat" and "hostile policy"]{.underline}
against North Korea, and that nuclear weapons are key to regime
survival. 12 When it has entered talks with the United States,
[Pyongyang's apparent negotiation goals have often have
included]{.underline} establishing official relations with the United
States, securing economic assistance, obtaining the removal of sanctions
and other restrictions on its interactions with the United States and
the rest of the world, **[downgrading if not removing the U.S. military
presence on the Korean Peninsula, concluding a nonaggression pact with
or winning security assurances from the United States,]{.underline}**
signing a peace treaty to replace the 1953 armistice that halted the
Korean War, and, more recently, being recognized as a nuclearweapons
state.13 [Congress has tools to influence whether and how intensely the
Administration pursues negotiations with North Korea, including
oversight hearings, resolutions expressing congressional sentiment,
restrictions on the use of funds for negotiations and the required
diplomatic team through the appropriations process, and legislation that
attaches or relaxes conditions and requirements for implementation of
agreements]{.underline}. [Congress has influenced past U.S.-DPRK talks
and in several cases affected the implementation of the negotiated
agreements.]{.underline} [Congress's role has been particularly
significant in negotiations over the provision of U.S. energy and
humanitarian assistance t]{.underline}o North Korea through the

2004 Congress established a Special Envoy on North Korean human rights
issues, with the rank of Ambassador, within the State Department.

[**The political dynamics in South Korea are also currently conducive to
an interim deal.** The administration of South Korean President Moon
Jae-in continues to lead the way in supporting diplomacy and peace with
North Korea]{.underline}, and whatever other obstacles he faces at home,
Moon can continue to engage with the North for now, as significant
constituencies in South Korea support the diplomacy. So far, [this
engagement has yielded results such as the Agreement on the
Implementation of the Historic Panmunjom Declaration in the Military
Domain, which reduces military tensions through measures that include
dismantling military posts and mines along the Demilitarized
Zone]{.underline}.7 Some supporters of diplomacy believe that Kim Jong
Un is different enough from his father and grandfather to make genuine
progress on denuclearization possible. They cite evidence such as the
rise of capitalist black markets, the spread of cell phones, and
increased information flows into North Korea.8 Although the current
environment in South Korea makes an interim deal with North Korea
possible, it is also highly politicized. As of May 2019, 45 percent of
South Koreans think that the Moon administration's North Korea policy is
going well, while 43 percent think it is not going well.9 However, 81
percent of members of Moon's party---the liberal Democratic Party of
Korea---believe that his [North Korea policy is going well, while 83
percent of the conservative Liberty Korea Party believes it is not going

skeptical of deepening ties with North Korea without concrete movement

more likely to denuclearize if more peaceful inter-Korea relations are
established.13 According to this theory, improved relations with North
Korea will help it feel secure enough to abandon its nuclear deterrent.

[Like all diplomacy, the ever-changing variable is the political will on
each side]{.underline}. Today, [the environments in the main
capitals---Seoul, Washington, D.C., Tokyo, Pyongyang, and Beijing---are
still complicated, but there is an opening for at least a partial
deal]{.underline}. A progressive government in Seoul is keen to develop
inter-Korea relations, while **[Pyongyang has shown at least a temporary
willingness to engage]{.underline}**. Meanwhile, an erratic and
unpredictable U.S. president looking for political wins has upended the
traditional U.S. playbook on North Korea; [the prime minister of Japan
is wary of engaging North Korea, but he prioritizes the U.S.-Japan
alliance and is willing to go along with the diplomacy]{.underline}; and
[China wants to deflect pressure from the United States. **This
combination presents a genuine opportunity for diplomatic
progress**]{.underline}---if only for the time being.

[There are three main elements to making progress with North Korea: 1)
understanding the politics in each capital to ensure that any deal will
not unravel; 2) allowing each side to come away portraying itself as the
victor;]{.underline} and 3) [enacting a substantive agreement that
advances enough that each side has a reason to stay invested in the
process]{.underline}. This report details each of these elements in
turn.

[The internal politics of North Korea are opaque]{.underline}. Limited
information comes out of the country that is not from state-run media,
and foreign media outlets are often severely limited in their ability to
report in the country. [But over the years, it has been clear that Kim
Jong Un's primary interest is regime security]{.underline}, much like it
was for his father and grandfather before him. [There are both internal
and external components to this: How can Kim prevent an outside power
from destabilizing his regime, and how can he maintain internal
stability so that domestic actors do not threaten the regime? North
Korea's development of nuclear weapons was in part motivated by these
considerations. With the possession of nuclear weapons, North Korea is
deterring outside aggression, but this delicate calculus also bets on
outside powers not threatening the regime because of its nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. North Korea's development of its nuclear program,
along with other illicit programs and destabilizing behavior, have
brought a series of international sanctions against the regime.28
Initially, the international community hoped that the economic effects
of these sanctions would destabilize the country enough that it would
choose to abandon its nuclear program, but North Korea has instead
doubled down. There is ongoing debate over the extent to which sanctions
imposed by the U.N. Security Council and individual countries since 2016
have affected the North Korean economy and, most importantly, elite
North Koreans.29 [Some analysts believe that North Korea came to the
bargaining table in 2018 because of the sanctions, while others think
that North Korea reached a point in its nuclear program that gave it
confidence that it had the leverage necessary to gain legitimacy for the
regime and its nuclear program or some sanctions relief]{.underline}.
Presumably, [North Korea wants sanctions relief regardless of whether or
not the sanctions have crippled the country's economy.]{.underline} The
North Korean government rarely makes data about its economy available,
and analysts must often rely on data from China, South Korea, and North
Korean defectors.

dismantlement of at least a significant portion of the Yongbyon nuclear
facility---and/or other North Korean nuclear facilities. [The
dismantlement would have to be verified and inspected by the
International Atomic Energy Agency. There are many possible permutations
to this part of the deal that extend beyond this baseline condition, and
the precise amount of dismantlement would be negotiated]{.underline}.
But [if North Korea committed to and followed through on dismantling a
sizable amount of its nuclear facilitie]{.underline}s---far beyond just
blowing up a cooling tower, as it did in 2008---[it would be a

[After]{.underline} nearly two months of [outrageous North Korean
threats and high tension on the]{.underline} Korean [peninsula, the
United States intends to rely much more heavily on China to achieve core
American security goals in Northeast Asia --- maintaining stability
while containing]{.underline} the threats from [Pyongyang]{.underline}.

[In the face of real uncertainty about North Korea's
intentions]{.underline} over the past weeks, [military
measures]{.underline} taken by the Obama administration [followed the
overriding logic of deterrence. Those measures helped preserve
stability]{.underline} in Korea [and prevent]{.underline} the outbreak
of [war]{.underline}.

It is far better, after all, to remind North Korea of U.S. capabilities
by flying B-52s, B-2 bombers and F-22 stealth fighters over South Korea
than to order pre-emptive strikes that could lead to a new Korean
conflict.

[Given North Korea's]{.underline} considerable military prowess ---
[large stocks of **c**]{.underline}hemical and
**[b]{.underline}**iological weapons, more than 100,000 highly-trained
special forces, extensive artillery and missiles deployed near the
demilitarized zone, and an army of 1.2 million soldiers, not to mention
a few **[n]{.underline}**uclear [weapons --- the costs of all-out
war]{.underline} to the U.S., South Korea, and possibly Japan, in lives,
property and treasure [are just too high.]{.underline}

In the event deterrence fails, the 10 million residents of Seoul would
be among the first victims, with hundreds of thousands of casualties in
the opening days of a new military conflict.

Looking back, as much as Americans despise North Korea and its leaders,
the U.S. government has recognized for decades that pursuing a new war
in Korea is not in America's interest precisely because of the high
costs --- even if it ultimately results in "regime change."

This calculation spurred the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush
administrations to pursue engagement with North Korea. Diplomacy reached
a high point in June 2008 when U.S. negotiators --- led by Ambassador
Christopher Hill and Ambassador Sung Kim --- persuaded North Korea to
shut down its reactor at Yongbyon that produced fissile material for
weapons and blow up the reactor's cooling tower to demonstrate
Pyongyang's commitment to denuclearization.

After the Obama administration came to power, however, diplomacy with
North Korea fell into disrepute. The reason most often cited is the view
expressed by former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates in 2009 that the
administration was tired of Pyongyang breaking deals in order to extort
more economic aid, which amounted to "selling the same horse twice."

A second reason embraced by the administration for rejecting diplomacy
with North Korea was recently set forth by [Richard Haass, president of
the Council on Foreign Relations, who told CNN "if we think that through
diplomacy, we're going to see the denuclearization of the Korean
peninsula, then we're nuts. We shouldn't kid ourselves. Diplomacy is not
going to solve this problem]{.underline}."

Early on, the administration elevated its broad rejection of diplomacy
to an official doctrine it called "strategic patience." Its single
effort to start negotiations with Pyongyang in the "Leap Day Accord" of
February 2012 broke down after North Korea's April 2012 missile test
caused the administration to scuttle the deal.

As much as some U.S. policymakers and most American experts detest
diplomacy with Pyongyang, they now face a pressing issue that has
upended their earlier calculations. [Short of mobilizing forces to
prepare for an invasion of North Korea --- which]{.underline}, in and of
itself, [could provoke a war --- the U.S. is running out of effective
military measures to strengthen its deterrence posture]{.underline}. In
recognition of this fact, the administration has sought in recent days
to significantly tone down its own strong rhetoric which it believes
only feeds North Korea's belligerence.

[To achieve core U.S. security objectives]{.underline} in the region ---
maintaining stability while containing the threat from Pyongyang ---
**[the U.S. must rely]{.underline}** on diplomacy once again.

The shape of this new US diplomacy is becoming increasingly clear: it
will rely [**heavily on China**. China is the one country with
sufficient influence and experience to curb Pyongyang's dangerous
threats against South Korea, Japan and the United States. Beijing's
impatience with North Korea has continued to mount ever
higher]{.underline}, leading China to support harsh new UN sanctions
against Pyongyang, following its third nuclear test.

In late March, South Korea's President Park Geun-hye asked China's new
President Xi Jinping for Beijing's support in bringing North Korea into
negotiations. According to the South Korean Blue House, "[Xi promised to
strengthen communication with South Korea to achieve peace, stability
and denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula, which he said benefits not
only Korea but also China]{.underline}."

Secretary of State John Kerry's meetings with Chinese leaders later this
week will focus heavily on how China can restore stability to the Korean
peninsula so as to contain Pyongyang while avoiding a new Korean War.
This will require China to more stringently apply economic sanctions
while holding out the prospect of political and economic benefits if
North Korea ratchets down its threatening rhetoric and actions.

[If the U.S. and China work together effectively to implement a common
diplomatic strategy that addresses the dangers from North Korea, it
would likely open up many new areas for Sino-American
cooperation]{.underline} in President Obama's second term. Beijing
[and]{.underline} President Xi will certainly [welcome a new American
policy that fosters closer relations]{.underline} with the United States
[and helps to overcome]{.underline} the [dangerously confrontational
China policy]{.underline} of Obama's first term in office.

The South China Sea is the nexus of numerous disputes among China and
its Southeast Asian neighbors, including Vietnam, the Philippines,
Taiwan and Indonesia, and involving extra-regional powers like Japan and
the United States. These range from territorial disputes over rocks and
islands to conflicts over maritime rights to rich fishing grounds, vast
hydrocarbon reserves, and critical global shipping routes. Most
dangerous, however, is the degree to which these disputes have been
imbued with the Great Power anxieties between the United States and
China.

Mollifying Sino-U.S. competition is a precondition for progress on any
of these disputes. **[The United States should leverage the prospect of
new military balancing capabilities to establish an accommodation with
China that forestalls additional and potentially destabilizing
militarization in the South China Sea, helping solidify the territorial
status quo as de facto dispute settlement.]{.underline}** While
imperfect, this is the most promising opportunity to ensure that
competition between the United States, China, and other claimants does
not escalate into military conflict.

[For China, this **accommodation means freezing the militarization of
its island bases**, especially in the Spratly Islands]{.underline}.
China's extraordinary [island-building
projects](https://amti.csis.org/island-tracker/chinese-occupied-features/) over
the past four years give it the capacity to base significant
over-lapping force projection capabilities: [fighter jets, bombers, and
batteries of air defense, anti-ship, and long-range strike
missiles]{.underline}. But crucially, China [has not
deployed](https://news.usni.org/2016/03/08/document-dni-assessment-of-chinese-militarization-reclamation-in-south-china-sea) any
of these force projection assets to its Spratly Island bases yet.

For the United States, this requires a pledge to keep capabilities it is
developing to contain China's power projection assets out of the Western
Pacific, where China would feel compelled to counter them. Concepts like
the U.S. Army's [Multi-Domain
Battle](https://warontherocks.com/2016/09/multi-domain-battle-a-new-concept-for-land-forces/) and [the

the First Island Chain, and potentially contribute to a blockade of air
and seaborne commerce to and from China. [As these concepts are still in
development, the United States must prioritize turning them into
deployable capabilities and thus a credible offer in return for China's
militarization freeze.]{.underline}

Understanding how such a resolution could be achieved requires
recognizing the essential role that U.S. military presence has played in
diplomatic progress in the South China Sea over the last 20 years. [The
U.S. presence in the South China Sea began expanding in the late 1990s
after [China seized Mischief
Reef ](https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/17/news/17iht-sprat_1.html)from
the Philippines in 1995]{.underline}, and since then the region's
territorial disputes have largely frozen -- settled for practical
purposes if not legal ones.

Most critically, it was U.S. military presence that [motivated China to
participate in talks](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/387714/summary) with
the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) out of a desire to
limit additional U.S. involvement in the region. However, further
progress has been painfully slow. **[Negotiations over [a binding Code
of Conduct between China](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/527061/pdf) and
ASEAN, which aims to prevent disputes amongst South China Sea claimants
from boiling over into open conflict, is now the region's
longest-running diplomatic effort]{.underline}**. The recent Sino-ASEAN
endorsement of [a
framework](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asean-philippines-southchinasea-idUSKBN1AM0AY) for
negotiations was little more than a restatement of [a joint declaration
from
2002](http://asean.org/?static_post=declaration-on-the-conduct-of-parties-in-the-south-china-sea-2).

In part, this is due to the pace of China's
extraordinary [naval](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL33153.pdf) and [maritime](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2015-04-0/chinas-second-navy) buildups,
and its extensive island reclamation and construction campaign since
that 2002 declaration. These activities have rapidly changed the
military balance, diminishing other stakeholders' ability to assert
claims, and increasing the risk and severity of a military clash.

China's recent warning that further progress on a [Code of Conduct is
contingent on noninterference by "outside parties" (that is, the United
States) was likely meant to avoid substantive diplomatic concessions to
ASEAN to forestall increased U.S. presence in the South China
Sea]{.underline}. **[This not only validates the critical role U.S.
military presence played in motivating Chinese participation in ASEAN
talks, but highlights why future progress will depend principally on a
mutual accommodation between the two]{.underline}**.

[The biggest hurdle to such an agreement is the unwillingness of either
country to be seen as conceding to the other]{.underline}. For the
United States, scaling back its military presence in the South China Sea
would communicate diminished regional influence. For China, to abandon
the massive island military outposts it has built would concede that its
"rise" has fallen short, and would bear untenable comparisons to
imperial China's capitulations during the "[Century of
Humiliation,](http://www.hscentre.org/asia-and-pacific/chinas-national-century-humiliation-context-todays-tensions/)"
which many Chinese policies in the South China Sea today ostensibly aim
to rectify.

[The solution is]{.underline} not for either country to concede current
ground or presence in the region, but [to concede those prospective
build-ups and capabilities that would fuel more intense
competition]{.underline}. Many analysts believe **[China will use any
substantial increases in U.S. military presence in the South China Sea
as pretext to deploy forces to its (for now) largely empty bases in the
Spratly Islands]{.underline}**. But if China agrees to keep its fighter
squadrons and missile regiments on the mainland in return for the United
States keeping its (as-yet notional) expeditionary containment
capabilities out of the Western Pacific, a tense but fundamentally
peaceful status quo in the South China Sea can be preserved without
either power being seen to withdraw. Implicit acceptance of the status
quo may be dissatisfying, but it saves all parties the humiliation of
officially conceding their claims and has the virtue of being a
dissatisfaction that is equitably distributed.

#### Specifically, China would [say yes]{.underline} to using ADIZ as a bargaining chip to reduce US defense ties to Southeast Asia -- Failure to bargain results in Chinese declaration of an ADIZ which collapses freedom of navigation

On March 30, [US deputy defence secretary Robert Work publicly declared
that the US had told China it would not recognise "an exclusion zone in
the South China Sea" and would view such a move as
"destabilising]{.underline}". The Asia Times said the Pentagon was
"trying to stop China" from declaring an air defence zone in disputed
seas. These seem almost fighting words. In response, Yang Yujun, the
spokesperson for China's defence ministry, said there was no need for
such "gesticulation".

What's going on?

[The US and China are competing for dominance in the region amid
conflicting sovereignty and maritime claims by China and some Southeast
Asian countries. The two powers hold different perspectives on "freedom
of navigation" and China's November 2013 declaration of an air defence
identification zone in the East China Sea.]{.underline}

Some journalists and US pundits have been hyping a "what if" situation,
as if to prepare for a clarion call for US military action if China
declares an air defence identification zone in the South China Sea.

[China has yet to declare such a zone in the South China Sea and may not
do so -- especially one that includes the disputed Spratly features. The
US "survived" China's declaration of an air defence identification zone
in the East China Sea with apparently little effect on either
country.]{.underline} The US said it would ignore that zone and
disregard any Chinese orders, although the Obama administration advised
US commercial airlines to comply with China's demands out of concern for
possible "misunderstandings".

The [establishment and implementation of air defence identification
zones have always been unilateral and controversial. There is no
international legal basis for them or their "rules" -- except perhaps
the general principles of self-defence and freedom of overflight, and
the former will always take precedence, for any country.]{.underline}

[The US established the precedent of an air defence identification zone
and its rules -- for itself and Japan, South Korea and Taiwan -- after
the second world war.]{.underline} It apparently thinks all other
nations' zones should be based on its model. But being first does not
justify dictating the rules for all, especially in the absence of an
international agreement.

[The US seems to have two objections to a hypothetical Chinese zone in
the South China Sea. If it is modelled on China's East China Sea zone,
then it would include both military and civilian aircraft, and its rules
would apply to aircraft that are only transiting the zone.]{.underline}
According to US Secretary of State John Kerry, "the US does not support
efforts by any state to apply procedures of an air defence
identification zone to foreign aircraft not intending to enter its
national airspace. We urge China not to implement its threat to take
action against aircraft that do not identify themselves or obey orders
from Beijing[." Japan has a similar requirement for Taiwanese aircraft
entering its zone, as do Australia, Myanmar and Taiwan for foreign
aircraft.]{.underline} [To back up this position, two unarmed but
nuclear-capable US B-52 bombers flew into China's new zone without
identifying themselves, clearly testing China's reaction.]{.underline}

[The US claims that it only applies its rules of prior notification to
enter its zones -- or "recommendations" to do so -- to civilian
aircraft, and that they only apply to aircraft destined for US
territorial airspace. **In practice, however, the US monitors and often
intercepts with fighter jets both civilian and military aircraft that do
not follow the "recommendations" of identifying themselves and their
destinations, particularly Russian Bear bombers in the zones off
Alaska.**]{.underline}

In the South and East China seas, an anti-China coalition is taking
shape

**[China claims that its East China Sea zone rules do not affect normal
commercial traffic and or interfere with freedom of overflight. This
aspect certainly requires clarification and reassurance. But, so far,
China has not shown any hostile intent.]{.underline}**

Some 55 airlines in 19 countries have complied with China's zone rules.
South Korea and Japan said its airlines do not recognise the zone. But
China has done nothing more than monitor and observe foreign military
aircraft flying unannounced in it -- following the same practice as the
US and Japan.

[An air defence identification zone in the South China Sea may help
China counter US and potential Japanese aerial reconnaissance measures
-- long a bone of contention between China and the US.]{.underline} The
US has regularly sent EP3-E surveillance planes and more recently
Poseiden 8As along the coast of China to intercept communications and
monitor coastal and maritime military activities, including submarine
movements, averaging 400 such flights each year. **[The aircraft
sometimes "tickle" the Chinese military, generating responses which can
then be monitored for planning military attacks.]{.underline}**

[**Other airborne activities have been alleged to include interference
with communications, jamming of radar, and cyber attacks**. These
activities appear to involve far greater interference with the
communications and defence systems of China than any traditional passive
intelligence gathering conducted from outside national
territor]{.underline}y. Indeed, China has alleged that these activities
abuse the principle of freedom of overflight.

First of all, air defence identification zones covering parts of the
South China Sea already exist -- one by Taiwan and one by the
Philippines. So this would not necessarily be something completely new.

There are several possibilities. [China may not declare such a zone.
Ironically, whether it does or not may depend on US behaviour. If the US
continues its provocative behaviour in China's exclusive economic zone,
Beijing may perceive an "aerial threat" sufficient to declare an air
defence identification zone]{.underline}. This is rational and
understandable.

**[China could declare a zone out to, say, 200 nautical miles off its
South China Sea coast but not including any disputed islands or maritime
space, except the Paracels -- which are disputed between only China and
Vietnam -- and possibly Pratas Islands (which are claimed and occupied
by Taiwan).]{.underline}** That would probably be grudgingly accepted by
most of its critics.

But **[a Chinese zone that includes some disputed Spratly islands and
their maritime space would be politically problematic for all concerned.
It would be a manifestation of the worst fears of the US, Japan and
Southeast Asian militaries that China wants to control the South China
Sea, including its air corridors and sea lanes.]{.underline}** This
would, in their eyes, be tantamount to a threat to freedom of navigation
and may even be a red line for the US. Indeed, the US and others would
probably repeatedly and publicly violate it with military aircraft,
embarrassing China's leadership. That is why China is unlikely to do so.

**[What would a compromise look like? China wants the US to cease or at
least cut back on its provocative probes. The US does not want China to
declare an air defence identification zone over the Spratlys or further
militarise its reclaimed features there. A trade-off might be
possible.]{.underline}**

#### Otherwise, it escalates

**[The U.S. has critical direct interests at stake in the East Asia and
South Asia commons that include sea, air, space, and cyber interests.
These interests include an economic interest in the free flow of
commerce and the military use of the commons to safeguard America's own
security and contribute to the security of its allies and
partners]{.underline}**.

Washington has long provided the security backbone in these areas, which
in turn has supported the region's remarkable economic development.
However, China is taking increasingly assertive steps to secure its own
interests in these areas independent of U.S. efforts to maintain freedom
of the commons for all in the region. It cannot be assumed that China
shares a common conception of international space with the United States
or an interest in perpetuating American predominance in securing the
commons. In addition, as China expands its naval capabilities, it will
be operating farther and farther away from Chinese shores. China has now
established its first formal overseas military base, having initialed an

The aggressiveness of the Chinese navy, maritime law enforcement forces,
and air forces in and over the waters of the East China Sea and South
China Sea, coupled with ambiguous, extralegal territorial claims and
assertion of control there, poses an incipient threat to American and
overlapping allied interests. Chinese military writings emphasize the
importance of establishing dominance of the air and maritime domains in
any future conflict. East China Sea. Since 2010, China has intensified
its efforts to assert claims of sovereignty over the Senkaku Islands of
Japan in the East China Sea. Beijing asserts not only exclusive economic
rights within the disputed waters, but also recognition of "historic"
rights to dominate and control those areas as part of its territory.
Chinese and Japanese maritime law enforcement and coast guard vessels
regularly operate in waters surrounding the Senkakus that are
administered by Japan, raising the potential for miscalculation and
escalation into a military clash. In the summer of 2016, China began to
deploy naval units into the area.

[In November 2013, China declared an Air Defense Identification Zone
(ADIZ) in the East China Sea that largely aligned with its claimed
maritime Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)]{.underline}. The People's
Liberation Army declared that it would "take defense emergency measures
to respond to aircraft that do not cooperate in identification or refuse
to follow orders."52 The announcement was a provocative act and another
Chinese attempt to change the status quo unilaterally. The ADIZ
declaration is part of a broader Chinese pattern of using intimidation
and coercion to assert expansive extralegal claims of sovereignty and/or
control incrementally. In June 2016, [a Chinese fighter made an "unsafe"
pass near a U.S. RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft in the East China Sea
area]{.underline}. In March 2017, Chinese authorities warned the crew of
an American B-1B bomber operating in the area of the ADIZ that they were
flying illegally in PRC airspace. In response to the incident, the
Chinese Foreign Ministry called for the U.S. to respect the ADIZ.53 In
May, the Chinese intercepted an American WC-135, also over the East
China Sea.54

South China Sea. [**Roughly half of global trade in goods, a third of
trade in oil, and over half of global liquefied natural gas shipments
pass through the South China Sea,** which also accounts for
approximately 10 percent of global fish catch and may contain massive
potential reserves of oil and natural gas. The U.S. Navy also operates
in the area and requires access to meet its security and treaty
obligations in the region most effectively.]{.underline}

**[The South China Sea is hotly contested by six countries, including
Taiwan and the Philippines.]{.underline}** [Incidents between Chinese
law enforcement vessels and other claimants' fishing boats occur on a
regular basis there, as do other Chinese assertions of administrative
authority.]{.underline} The U.S. presence also has become an object of
Chinese attention, from confrontations with the ocean surveillance ship
USNS Impeccable and the destroyer USS John McCain in 2009 to the
confrontation with the guided-missile cruiser USS Cowpens in December
2013 and a dangerous intercept of a U.S. Navy P-8 aircraft in August
2014. In May 2016, there was another unsafe intercept of an American
aircraft, an EP-3, and in December, the crew of a PLA Navy vessel seized
an American unmanned underwater vehicle as it was being recovered by the
USNS Bowditch. There were several similar incidents involving U.S.
aircraft during the first half of 2017.

The most serious intraregional incidents in the South China Sea have
occurred between China and the Philippines and China and Vietnam. In
2012, a Philippine naval ship operating on behalf of the country's coast
guard challenged private Chinese poachers in waters around Scarborough
Shoal. The resulting escalation left Chinese government ships in control
of the shoal. In 2016, there were reports that the Chinese intend to
consolidate their gains in the area by reclaiming the sea around the
shoal, but there is as yet no indication that this has happened.
Furthermore, with the election of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte
in 2016, there has been a general warming in China--Philippines
relations. Duterte has sought to set aside the dispute over the South
China Sea, and the Chinese, while not accepting the authority of a 2016
ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) that favored a range
of the Philippines' positions, have allowed Filipino fishermen access to
Scarborough Shoal in accordance with it. China--Vietnam tensions in the
South China Sea were on starkest display in 2014 when state-owned China
National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) deployed an oil rig inside
Vietnam's EEZ. The Chinese platform was accompanied by dozens of ships
including naval vessels. The resulting escalation saw Chinese ships
ramming Vietnamese law enforcement ships and using water cannon against
the crews of Vietnamese ships. It also resulted in massive and sometimes
violent demonstrations in Vietnam. The oil rig was ultimately withdrawn,
and relations were restored, but the occasional reappearance of the same
rig has served to underscore the continuing volatility of this issue,
which involves the same area over which China and Vietnam engaged in
armed battle in 1974. The most significant development in the South
China Sea during the past three years has been Chinese reclamation and
militarization of seven artificial islands or outposts. In his April
2017 posture statement to the House Committee on Armed Services, Admiral
Harry Harris, Commander, U.S. Pacific Command, described the state of
these islands: China's military-specific construction in the Spratly
islands includes the construction of 72 fighter aircraft hangars---which
could support three fighter regiments---and about ten larger hangars
that could support larger airframes, such as bombers or special mission
aircraft. All of these hangars should be completed this year. During the
initial phases of construction China emplaced tank farms, presumably for
fuel and water, at Fiery Cross, Mischief and Subi reefs. These could
support substantial numbers of personnel as well as deployed aircraft
and/or ships. All seven outposts are armed with a large number of
artillery and gun systems, ostensibly for defensive missions. The recent
identification of buildings that appear to have been built specifically
to house long-rang surface-to-air missiles is the latest indication
China intends to deploy military systems to the Spratlys.55 The 2016 PCA
award invalidated China's sweeping claims to waters in the South China
Sea and found its "island" reclamation to be in violation of Beijing 's
commitments under the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).
There is the possibility that China will ultimately declare an ADIZ
above the South China Sea in an effort to assert its authority. There
are also concerns that in the event of a downturn in its relationship
with the Philippines, it will take action against vulnerable targets
like Philippines-occupied Second Thomas Shoal or Reed Bank, which the
panel determined are part of the Philippines EEZ and continental shelf,
or proceed with the reclamation at Scarborough. The latter development
in particular would facilitate the physical assertion of Beijing's
claims and enforcement of an ADIZ, regardless of the UNCLOS award.
Airpower. Although China is not yet in a position to enforce an ADIZ
consistently in either area, the steady two-decade improvement of the
PLA Air Force (PLAAF) and naval aviation will eventually provide the
necessary capabilities. Chinese observations of recent conflicts,
including wars in the Persian Gulf, the Balkans, and Afghanistan, have
emphasized the growing role of airpower and missiles in conducting
"noncontact, non-linear, non-symmetrical" warfare. China also seems to
have made a point of publicizing its air force modernization, unveiling
new aircraft prototypes, including two new stealthy fighters, on the eve
of visits by American Secretaries of Defense. (Secretary Chuck Hagel's
visit in 2014 was preceded by the unveiling of the J-15 naval fighter.)
Those aircraft have been flown much more aggressively, with Chinese
fighters flying very close to Japanese aircraft in China's East China
Sea ADIZ and conducting armed combat air patrols in the skies over
Tibet.56 The PLA has shed most of its 1960s-era aircraft, replacing them
with much more modern systems. Today's PLAAF is dominated by
fourth-generation and 4.5th-generation fighter aircraft. These include
the domestically designed and produced J-10, as well as the
Su-27/Su-30/J-11 system, comparable to the F-15 or F-18, that dominates
both the fighter and strike missions.57 Older airframes such as the J-7
are steadily being retired from the fighter inventory. China is also
believed to be preparing to field two stealthy fifth-generation fighter
designs. The J-20 is the larger aircraft, resembling the American F-22
fighter. The J-31 appears to resemble the F-35 but with two engines
rather than one. The production of advanced combat aircraft engines
remains one of the greatest challenges to Chinese fighter design. China
fields some long-range strike aircraft, largely the H-6 bomber based on
the Sovietera Tu-16 Badger. While this aircraft has little prospect of
penetrating advanced air defenses, it is suitable as a cruise missile
carrier. China also has used the H-6 as the basis for initial efforts to
develop an aerial tanker fleet and seems to be examining other options
as well. As China deploys more tankers, this will extend the range and
loiter time of its fighter aircraft. China will then be better equipped
to enforce its newly declared East China Sea Air Defense Identification
Zone and any possible future South China Sea ADIZ. A variety of modern
support aircraft have also entered the PLAAF inventory, including
airborne early warning (AEW), command and control (C2), and electronic
warfare (EW) aircraft. At the Zhuhai Air Show, Chinese companies have
displayed a variety of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), reflecting
substantial investments and research and development efforts. The
surveillance and armed UAV systems include the Xianglong (Soaring
Dragon) and Sky Saber systems. The 2014 DOD report on Chinese
capabilities also reports that China has tested a stealthy flying-wing
UAV, the Lijian.58 China's air defenses, which are under the control of
the PLAAF, have also been steadily modernizing. China has acquired the
advanced S-300 surface-to-air missile (SAM) system (SA-10B/SA-20), which
is roughly analogous to the American Patriot SAM system, and is
developing its own advanced SAM, the HQ -9, which is deployed both on
land and at sea. In early 2014, Russia announced that it would sell
China the S-400 SAM system. This would mark a substantial improvement in
PLAAF air defense capabilities, as the S-400 has anti-aircraft and
anti-missile capabilities.59 China has deployed these SAM systems in a
dense, overlapping belt along its coast, protecting the nation's
economic center of gravity. Key industrial and military centers such as
Beijing are also heavily defended by SAM systems. Some of these systems
have reportedly been deployed to the Paracel islands in the South China
Sea. A third component of the PLAAF is China's airborne forces. The 15th
Airborne Army is part of the PLAAF, with three divisions of
10,000--15,000 personnel each. These are not believed to be assigned to
any of the Chinese military regions but are instead a strategic reserve
as well as a rapid reaction force. In 2009, in the military review
associated with the 60th anniversary of the founding of the PRC, Chinese
airborne units paraded through Tiananmen Square with ZBD-03 mechanized
airborne combat vehicles. These vehicles provide Chinese airborne forces
with tactical mobility as well as some degree of protected fire support
from their 30mm autocannon and HJ-73 anti-tank missile (a domestic
version of the AT-3 Sagger)---something American airborne forces
continue to lack. One shortcoming of the Chinese airborne forces is the
lack of military transport aircraft, although the PLAAF undoubtedly can
call on China's substantial civilian fleet of airliners in time of
crisis or war. Sea power. As the world's foremost trading state, China
depends on the seas for its economic well-being. China's factories are
increasingly powered by imported oil, and Chinese diets contain a
growing percentage of imported food. Chinese products rely on the seas
to be moved to markets. At the same time, because China's economic
center of gravity is now in the coastal region, it has had to emphasize
maritime power to defend key assets and areas. Consequently, China has
steadily expanded its maritime power, including its merchant marine and
maritime law enforcement capabilities, but especially the People's
Liberation Army Navy (PLAN). The PLAN is no longer an unsophisticated
coastal defense force. Instead, since the end of the Cold War, China's
navy has moved away from reliance on mass toward incorporating advanced
platforms and weapons. Most notably, the Chinese navy is the first in
East Asia to deploy its own aircraft carrier since World War II. The
Liaoning carries a mixed air group of J-15 fighters (based on the
navalized Su-27) and helicopters and is believed to be fully
operational. Meanwhile, many obsolete vessels have been decommissioned,
including scores of older, missile-armed, fast attack craft. In their
place, China has produced a range of more capable combatants and is
building each class in significant numbers. These range from the Type
022 Houbei missile-armed catamaran, armed with sea-skimming supersonic
anti-ship cruise missiles, to the Type-052C Luyang-II destroyer,
equipped with a phased-array radar for its HQ-9 SAM system. The HQ-9,
with its ability to combat most air-breathing systems and a limited
anti--ballistic missile capability, is believed to be comparable to
early model Patriot missiles. Although these new ships are not replacing
older Chinese surface combatants on a one-for-one basis, the overall
capability of the PLAN surface force is steadily improving. The PLAN has
similarly been modernizing its submarine force. Since 2000, the PLAN has
consistently fielded between 50 and 60 diesel-electric submarines, but
the age and capability of the force has been improving as older boats,
especially 1950s-vintage Romeoclass boats, are replaced with newer
designs. These include a dozen Kilo-class submarines purchased from
Russia and domestically designed and manufactured Song and Yuan classes.
All of these are believed to be capable of firing not only torpedoes,
but also anti-ship cruise missiles. The Chinese have also developed
variants of the Yuan, with an air-independent propulsion (AIP) system
that reduces the boats' vulnerability by removing the need to use noisy
diesel engines to recharge batteries. The PLAN also has been augmenting
its aerial maritime strike capability. In addition to more modern
versions of the H-6 twin-engine bombers (a version of the Soviet/Russian
Tu16 Badger), the PLAN's Naval Aviation force has added a range of other
strike aircraft to its inventory. These include the JH-7/FBC-1 Flying
Leopard, which can carry between two and four YJ-82 anti-ship cruise
missiles, and the Su-30 strike fighter. Within Chinese littoral waters,
the PLAN Air Force can bring a significant amount of firepower to bear.
The PLAN also has been working to improve its "fleet train." The 2010
PRC defense white paper notes the accelerated construction of "large
support vessels." It also specifically notes that the navy is exploring
"new methods of logistics support for sustaining long-time maritime
missions."60 As with other aspects of PLA modernization, even as the
PLAN is upgrading its weapons, it is also improving its doctrine and
training, including increased emphasis on joint operations and the
incorporation of electronic warfare into its training regimen. Such
improvements suggest that PLA Air Force assets, space and cyber
operations, and even PLA Rocket Force units might support naval aviation
strikes. The new anti-ship ballistic missile forces, centered on the
DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile (now reportedly at initial
operational capability), should be seen as part of joint Chinese efforts
to control the seas, complementing PLAAF and PLAN air, surface, and
sub-surface forces

Escalation of Territorial Disputes or Incidents at Sea.

[Because the PRC and other countries in the region see active disputes
over the East and South China Sea]{.underline}s not as differences
regarding the administration of the commons, but rather **[as matters of
territorial sovereignty, there exists the threat of armed conflict
between China and American allies who are also claimants, particularly
Japan and the Philippines]{.underline}**. Beijing prefers to accomplish
its objectives quietly and through nonmilitary means. In both the East
and South China Seas, China has sought to exploit "gray zones," gaining
control incrementally and deterring others without resort to the lethal
use of force[. It uses military and economic threats, bombastic
language, and enforcement through military bullying]{.underline}.
Chinese paramilitary-implemented, military backed encroachment in
support of expansive extralegal claims could lead to an unplanned armed
clash.

[Rising **nationalism is exacerbating tensions**, making geostrategic
relations in Asia increasingly complex and volatile]{.underline}. In the
face of persistent economic challenges, [nationalist themes are becoming
an increasingly strong undercurrent]{.underline}, affecting
policymaking. Although the nationalist phenomenon is not new, it is
gaining force and [complicating efforts to maintain regional
stability.]{.underline}

Governments may choose to exploit nationalism for domestic political
purposes, but they also run the risk of being unable to control the
genie that they have released. Nationalist rhetoric is mutually
reinforcing, which makes countries less likely to back down than in the
past. The increasing power that the Internet and social media provide to
the populace, largely outside of government control, add elements of
unpredictability to future clashes.

In case of armed conflict between China and the Philippines or between
China and Japan, either by intention or as a result of an accidental
incident at sea, the U.S. could be required to exercise its treaty
commitments.[61 Escalation of a direct U.S.--China incident is itself
not unthinkable. Keeping an inadvertent incident from escalating into a
broader military confrontation would be difficult.]{.underline} **[This
is particularly true in the East and South China Seas, where naval as
well as civilian law enforcement vessels from both China and the U.S.
operate in what the U.S. considers to be international
waters.]{.underline}**

WWTA: The WWTA does not address threats to the maritime and airspace
commons, but it does say that "[China will continue to pursue an active
foreign policy]{.underline}" in the region, "highlighted by \[among
other things\] a firm stance on competing territorial claims in the East
China Sea (ECS) and South China Sea (SCS)." It also predicts continuing
regional tensions "as China completes construction at its expanded
outposts in the SCS."62 It offers no judgment either on the threat that
this poses to American interests or on the prospect for large-scale
conventional conflict in the region.

Summary: [In both the air and maritime domains, **China is ever more
capable of challenging American dominance and disrupting the freedom of
the commons that benefits the entire region.** Both territorial disputes
related to what the U.S. and its allies consider the commons and
accidental incidents could draw the U.S. into conflict.]{.underline}
China likely does not intend to engage in armed conflict with its
neighbors, particularly American treaty allies, or with the U.S. itself.
[However, **it will continue to press its territorial claims at sea in
ways that, even if inadvertent, cause incidents that could escalate into
broader conflict.**]{.underline}

#### Nuclear war

**[Rando, 15]{.underline}**

(9/29, Consultant- Asymmetric Global Solutions DBA, MPH/MS-Biomedical
Sciences & US Correspondent-Chemical, Biological, Nuclear Warfare
Journal, Fire on the Water: The South China Sea and Nuclear
Confrontation,
http://www.cbrneportal.com/fire-on-the-water-the-south-china-sea-and-nuclear-confrontation/)

Robert Kaplan, one of the world's foremost experts on China, has stated
"**[The South China Sea will be the 21st Century's defining
battleground]{.underline}**." The obsession with supremacy in the South
China Sea is certainly not a new phenomenon in the realms of
international security and maritime strategy. In opinionated discussions
related to naval warfare, prominent political scientists and military
strategists have been addressing the geopolitical and military
significance of the region for decades. For example, the enlightening
1997 article "The Chinese Way", written in the Bulletin of Atomic
Scientists by Professor Chalmers Johnson of the University of
California-San Diego, noted significantly increased defense budgets and
expenditures in the region. In addition, the article eludes to the fact
that China had claimed the entire South China Sea and would use its
naval forces to counter any encroachment. [The argument for an increased
U.S. naval presence in East Asia is certainly not without precedent.
This contested aquatic region has tremendous geopolitical, strategic and
economic significance]{.underline}. While, the Persian Gulf has immense
importance and global recognition due to its strategic location in the
Middle East, as well its significance to global commerce, industry and
sought after oil, [the South China Sea is crucially important to nations
seeking to obtain their economic riches and geopolitical
advantages]{.underline}. The South China Sea is geographically located
near the Pacific Ocean and encompasses an area of 1.4 million square
miles (3.5 million square kilometers). As a semi-closed area, the South
China Sea extends from the Singapore Strait to the Taiwan Strait, with
China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Taiwan
surrounding it. [In terms of economic value, fishery stocks and
potential fossil fuel reserves are two major commodities that may spark
an armed conflict, even to the point of **nuclear
confrontation**.]{.underline} As a rich source of the region's staple
diet, fish, the sea guarantees a steady flow of food to the countries of
the region. Control and supremacy of the sea would also assure claiming
the much touted hydrocarbon reserves in the seabed, possibly exceeding
those of the OPEC nations such as Iraq and Kuwait. The conquest of this
vast resource would virtually assure energy independence and high
monetary returns for those that would gain supremacy over the South
China Sea. Thus, seizing the opportunity to gain dominance will lead to
control and manipulation of vital food and energy resources, economic
wealth and geopolitical power in the region. [A scenario of regional and
maritime domination and control could lead to the partial or total
exclusion of adjacent nation-states to access any food or natural
resources]{.underline} derived from a sea ruled with an iron hand;
[leading to a massive complex humanitarian catastrophe of immense
proportions from malnutrition and starvation, limitations in **energy
production**, and **economic collapse**.]{.underline} These factors make
the South China Sea a national security priority for nations in the
region, including one of the world's superpowers, China. The dependence
of China and other regional nations surrounding the South China Sea on
the Strait of Malacca is analogous in geopolitical and economic terms,
to the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Approximately one -third of
all global trade funnels through the strait and also serves as a conduit
for raw materials and energy needs for China and other adjacent
nation-states. [Such potential dominance in any region, leads to a
high-stakes game of brinkmanship, and at least the possibility of a
regional war which could conceivably escalate to engulf nation-states
external to the regional sphere. Tensions and skirmishes have the
propensity to evolve into armed conflict and **full-scale
war**]{.underline}, and apprehensive leaders and military planners in
such a contested region serve as the facilitators for disaster. China
continues to assert sovereignty by constructing man made islands using
sand dredged from the sea bottom and these artificial islands could be
militarized. China has even affirmed its desire to have a military
presence on these islands; however, the Chinese Foreign Minister Wang
Yi, also professes the use of these land masses to facilitate commerce
via shipping lanes and to protect Chinese fishing and other vessels from
piracy. China will never cease its quest for supremacy and its perceived
"ownership" of the South China Sea, as the legitimacy and structure of
the Chinese government is based on nationalism and achievement of the
"Chinese Dream". The Chinese regime continues to vehemently assert their
perceived "right" to the South China Sea, and it forges ahead with plans
and operations that could lead to naval warfare and conflict escalation.
The knowledge that China possesses formidable naval capacity and
capabilities, including nuclear-capable ballistic missile submarines,
is, indeed, disconcerting at the very least. As we examine and evaluate
the "submarine factor", it is evident that China's submarines have no
practical value in its disputes with Vietnam and the Philippines.
Essentially, nuclear ballistic missile capable submarines serve as a
deterrent against thermonuclear war. Without doubt, the primary reason
that China possesses nuclear-capable submarines is to deter an American
attack, although India's nuclear weapons are also a consideration for
Beijing. Nuclear capable submarines are capable of deep dive
capabilities and shorter launch to target times. While China's submarine
capabilities may appear worrisome to some, sudden deployment from port
in a geopolitical crisis would serve as a critical indicator to the US
and Western allies, and its submarine fleet still remains somewhat noisy
and detectable. China has already demonstrated its aggression at sea in
several instances, such as the ramming and sinking of a Vietnamese
fishing boat in disputed waters claimed by both countries in the region
and an ominous presence and military mobilization exercises which have
been monitored by military and intelligence assets. A report by the
National Air and Space Intelligence Center, indicates that Chinese SSBNs
are able to target portions of the U.S. from strategic operational
positions near the Chinese coast. China's Global Times published an
unprecedented report that revealed a nuclear missile strike on the
western U.S. with JL-2 missiles could generate up to 12 million American
fatalities. The Obama administration and senior U.S. naval officials
have not retorted to China's claims of a potentially devastating nuclear
threat, which included graphics showing radiological plumes and
collateral damage induced by radiation. The possibilities of China's
anti-satellite strategies to disable communications and
intelligence-gathering capabilities must also be taken seriously. Most
assuredly, **[the South China Sea would serve as an obvious arena for
the projection of Chinese power, including]{.underline}** conventional
and, potentially, **[nuclear scenarios.]{.underline}**

### US Leverage Key

#### Talks now -- SEA alone doesn't have enough leverage (Vietnam also key to talks)

**[Jennings 19]{.underline}** Ralph Jennings, 5-8-2019, \"China, Wary of
US, Pushes to Accelerate Accident Prevention Deal in Disputed Sea,\"
Voice of America,

TAIPEI - [China and Southeast Asian countries that dispute sovereignty
over a strategic Asian sea aim to speed up talks toward a code of
conduct that would lower the risk of accidents and help keep the U.S.
government out of the fray.]{.underline}

[Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said his country **and a bloc of
Southeast Asian states will \"speed up\" talks on a code of conduct in
the South China Sea, Beijing\'s state-run China Daily reported March 8.
Wang told reporters days later the talks were \"gathering pace under a
clear road map."**]{.underline}

That goal should mean a 2020 signing date \-- ahead of an earlier
Chinese forecast of 2021 \-- for the agreement aimed at guiding ships
away from mishaps in the vast, crowded South China Sea, some analysts
believe.

[China resents the U.S. Navy for passing ships through the sea, where
Beijing has a military and technological advantage over the four
Southeast Asian countries that also claim parts of it.]{.underline} An
early signing of the code would show Washington that Beijing can work
with its neighbors without U.S. influence, scholars say.

"If there's no United States, the Chinese won't say that the code of
conduct is a must-have document," said Yun Sun, East Asia Program senior
associate with the Stimson Center think tank in Washington, D.C.

"With a code of conduct, the Chinese could tell the Americans that 'we
already have a deal, and there's no reason for you to get involved and
whatever we do is between me, China, and them, Southeast Asian
countries,'" she said.

**[Brunei, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam claim
all or parts of the 3.5 million-square-kilometer sea that's prized for
fisheries, shipping lanes and fossil fuel reserves. China has alarmed
the others since 2010 by building artificial islands for military
installations.]{.underline}**

Washington, which counts some of the other states as allies, stepped up
naval patrols of the sea in 2017 to monitor Chinese activity there.

Laggard increases speed

China and the 10-country Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
have talked off and on about a code of conduct for the sea since ASEAN
endorsed the idea in 1996. Some analysts believe China had once stalled
the process but came around in 2016 after losing a world court
arbitration over the legal basis for its claim to about 90 percent of
the sea.

As tough Sino-ASEAN discussions began after a 2017 commitment to reach a
deal, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang anticipated last year the code would
take three years to finish.

**[Next year is likely for a deal on the code of conduct because China
hopes to work with Vietnam, the 2020 chair of ASEAN, said Termsak
Chalermpalanupap, fellow with the ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute in
Singapore. China and ASEAN are focusing this year on trade
liberalization, he said.]{.underline}**

"I think the Chinese side seems to indicate they now want to make it
quicker,\" he said. \"I think it may be next year. Next year will be the
turn of Vietnam chairing ASEAN. I think China may have strategic reasons
to work with Vietnam."

Vietnam is the most outspoken Southeast Asian country with claims to the
sea. Although accidents are rare in the sea today, Vietnamese and
Chinese vessels rammed one another over a Chinese oil rig in 2014. They
also engaged in deadly clashes in 1974 and 1988.

[The code of conduct is due to set out guidelines for stopping such
incidents in the sea that supports one-third of the world's marine
shipping traffic and a fishing industry that employs an estimated 3.7
million people.]{.underline}

Foiling US naval movements

[Under President Donald Trump, the U.S. Navy has passed ships through
the South China Sea at least 10 times. China resents those movements,
because the militarily stronger U.S. government \-- an old Cold War foe
\-- makes no claim to the sea.]{.underline}

**[Progress toward the code of conduct will improve spirits at future
Sino-ASEAN joint military exercises, said Alexander Huang, strategic
studies professor at Tamkang University in Taiwan.]{.underline}**

Next month, the Pentagon will unveil a new Indo Pacific military
strategy before defense chiefs around the Asia Pacific at the Shangri-La
Dialogue later this month, according to the USNI News website. The
strategy is seen as a way to monitor Chinese maritime expansion.

"Probably China wanted to have some input before the U.S.
pronouncement," Huang said.\]

U.S. officials have historic alliances with Taiwan the Philippines plus
a budding relationship with its old war foe Vietnam. Those countries,
all militarily weaker than China, look to Washington to cap Chinese
influence.

Acceleration of talks toward a code of conduct won't be easy, analysts
have warned. They expect that sovereignty-conscious Beijing will oppose
defining the scope of the sea, resist any binding agreement and block
provisions for enforcement that would limit Chinese maritime activities.
ASEAN is expected to ask for those details during talks.

ASEAN finds some of the Chinese demands are "impossible," Sun said.

China has advocated before a speedier deal to show goodwill in Southeast
Asia, yet without results, cautioned Oh Ei Sun, senior fellow with the
Singapore Institute of International Affairs. "From time to time they
will put out statements like that," he said. "The negotiations simply
did not conclude."

[At regional meetings in Kuala Lumpur recently, China attempted to
reassure regional nations of its peaceful intentions and deflect
attention from its destabilizing activities in the Spratly Island chain
in the South China Sea]{.underline}. Speaking to reporters, Chinese
Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that Beijing had halted dredging sand to
build artificial islands. "China has already stopped. You just take an
airplane to take a look," he maintained.

But Wang said nothing about ongoing construction and militarization of
several land features. A 10,000-foot runway is nearly complete on Fiery
Cross Reef, and according to Pacific Commander Harry Harris, the Chinese
appear to be building hangars for tactical fighters. **[Satellite
imagery also suggests that China may be getting ready to build a second
runway on nearby Subi Reef. Early warning radar stations, military
barracks, helipads, and lookout towers have been installed on several
features and harbors large enough to receive tankers and major surface
combatants are being built.]{.underline}**

Wang Yi's remarks were timed to coincide with a series of high level
meetings in Malaysia this week led by the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN), including the ASEAN Regional Forum and the East Asia
Summit Foreign Ministers' Meeting in which the United States
participates. Pressure has been building on China to exercise
self-restraint and engage in purposeful dialogue aimed at lowering
tensions in the South China Sea.

At the Shangri-La Dialogue in June, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter
called for an "immediate and lasting halt to land reclamation by all
claimants" and a halt to "further militarization of dispute features."
Earlier this week, ASEAN Secretary-General Le Luong Minh criticized
Beijing for "eroding the very trust and confidence . . . between ASEAN
and China" through its "reclamation activities, illegal fishing bans and
the harassment of fishermen."

Despite Chinese insistence that ASEAN should not discuss the territorial
disputes at the annual ASEAN Foreign Minister's Meeting, which wass
attended by 10 Southeast Asian nations that comprise the organization,
Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, host of this year's series of
meetings, said publicly that it was time for ASEAN to "take a more
active role" in managing "overlapping claims" and safeguarding regional
security.

[Sensing the rising angst in the region about its island building in the
South China Sea, in the run-up to the meetings this week China attempted
to signal a willingness to work with regional players by agreeing to
establish hotlines among foreign ministries to respond to maritime
emergencies. The efficacy of such hotlines is dubious, however, since
coast guards, navies, and maritime militias are not administered by
foreign ministries.]{.underline} Moreover, China's foreign ministry is
known to be institutionally weak and is rarely put in charge of handling
crises. A maritime rights leading group headed by Xi Jinping is far more
powerful.

More importantly, what is urgently needed is a binding Code of Conduct
(CoC) to replace the voluntary 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of
Parties in the South China Sea (DoC). In talks between China and ASEAN
this week, Beijing agreed again to speed up consultations on a CoC, but
in practice it is unlikely to do so, at least until it has completed its
near-term plan, which may include establishing an Air Defense
Identification Zone in the South China Sea and creating the
infrastructure to enforce it.

China appears to be increasingly uncomfortable with the growing chorus
reproving Chinese activities in the South China Sea. Beijing's agreement
to establish hotlines and quicken the pace of CoC discussions suggests
that the Chinese recognize that their behavior is causing greater
anxiety amongst their neighbors than they anticipated. So far, however,
the pushback has not been sufficient to change China's calculus, which
is that in the long term, Southeast Asian nations will be compelled to
accommodate to Chinese interests in the South China Sea. [Therefore,
greater efforts are needed to persuade China to adopt a more
compromising approach that truly emphasizes peaceful management of
disputes and respects the interests of all the players regardless of
size and military capabilities. To achieve this goal, ASEAN must demand
conclusion of a binding CoC before the end of 2015 that contains
risk-reduction measures and a dispute settlement mechanism. If China is
unwilling to do so, ASEAN, or a sub-group of like-minded members, should
proceed unilaterally. **The US should do its utmost to help forge this
consensus.**]{.underline}

### Negotiations Key

#### China is open to negotiations but won't abide by CoC now

**[Bowen 17]{.underline}** James Bowen, 8-6-2017, \"The South China Sea
Code of Conduct: Another Prelude to Action?,\" IPI Global Observatory,

Lowell-SB

[In the lead-up to today's official 50th anniversary of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the bloc's foreign ministers duly
celebrated one of its more recent, but already well-established,
traditions: fiercely debating language on the South China Sea dispute to
include in a joint communique from their most recent annual
meeting.]{.underline}

While assertive action by China has made the risk of conflict in the
South China Sea a significant concern, what emerged from the
Manila-hosted event was another mild rebuke of the "land reclamations
and activities in the area, which have eroded trust and confidence,
increased tensions and may undermine peace, security and stability."
[The statement did not name China as the party most responsible for
these activities, nor did it condemn them as vociferously as reportedly
demanded by Vietnam in particular.]{.underline}

**[The foreign ministers earlier agreed on a "framework" for a code of
conduct in the vast body of water, whose overlapping territorial and
maritime claims also include ASEAN members Brunei, Malaysia, and the
Philippines, as well as China's near neighbor Taiwan]{.underline}**.
Such a code has been hailed as the key to managing tensions in the area
by the likes of the United States and other non-claimant parties ever
since a related declaration was first signed in 2002. Progress toward
its full development and implementation has stalled, however, as clashes
over fishing, petroleum development, military buildup, and other
activities have intensified.

The new framework is not being heralded as the definitive breakthrough
that will ensure long-term stability in the sea, through which an
estimated \$3.4 trillion worth of international trade passes annually.
What has been achieved is only a framework for further negotiation; it
is a skeleton agreement, and adding flesh to its bones in a mutually
agreeable fashion will be a difficult task (the full text of the
agreement has not been released).

[There has also been no indication of an end---or even a start---date
for the process of formulation; only a vague intention to work toward
the "conclusion of an effective COC in a mutually-agreed
timeline."]{.underline} While Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke
about the possibility of talks beginning sometime this year, "if the
situation in the South China Sea is generally stable," this only adds
confusion to a process that is ostensibly designed to achieve that
stability in the first place. Some observers, such as the University of
the Philippines' Jay Batongbacal, see the lack of clarity over key dates
and details as handing China "the absolute upper hand," by buying its
leaders an indefinite amount of time in which to achieve their strategic
aims.

[The timing of what China contends is an acquiescence to ASEAN demands
could also relate to the current state of American leadership in the
Asia-Pacific region]{.underline}. While Washington has traditionally
aligned with the Southeast Asian bloc's position on the South China
Sea---at least in its defense of the relevant provisions of
international law, through official statements and regular "freedom of
navigation" operations---it has been noticeably less committed to
regional engagement under President Donald Trump, who has withdrawn the
US from the Asia-focused Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and
questioned long-standing military alliances in the region. [This cannot
help but improve China's hand in negotiating with ASEAN.]{.underline}

Perhaps the biggest criticism to be levelled at the new framework is
that there is no suggestion that any forthcoming code of conduct will be
legally binding. This omission was enough for the foreign ministers of
the US, Japan, and Australia---all of which have strong strategic and
economic interests in Southeast Asia---to issue a joint statement of
their own, calling on ASEAN and China to establish a set of rules for
the South China Sea that were "legally binding, meaningful, effective,
and consistent with international law."

A mechanism to uphold the rule of law in the South China Sea has
consistently been the standard that ASEAN members have demanded of
China; it has been just as consistently rejected by Beijing. The
framework agreed in Manila thus seems another capitulation on the part
of the Southeast Asian bloc, whose insistence on consensus-based
decision-making China has repeatedly exploited in recent years,
primarily through its influence on the positions of members Laos and
Cambodia. **[China, moreover, continues to justify its South China Sea
actions on grounds that are wholly incompatible with international law
and which focus instead on unilaterally upheld historical rights
delineated by its "nine-dash-line."]{.underline}**

[**As important as a legally binding nature to any code of conduct is
the inclusion of an enforcement mechanism to uphold decisions reached
during the adjudication of any disputes.** The potential ramifications
of such an absence were highlighted in the aftermath of last year's
decision of a tribunal in The Hague that affirmed the exclusive economic
rights of the Philippines, under the United Nations Convention on the
Law of the Sea, in waters Beijing also claims. Though the tribunal also
found "no legal basis for China to claim historic rights to resources
within the sea areas falling within the 'nine-dash line,'" it lacked any
means of making Beijing comply with its rulings.]{.underline}

On the brighter side of that equation[, the National University of
Singapore's Lynn Kuok has noted several promising signs of Chinese
compliance with the spirit of the tribunal's decision during the year
since it was handed down, even as it flatly rejected the ruling at the
time. These include an absence of Chinese navy and coast guard support
to illegal Chinese fishing in Indonesia's exclusive economic zone
(though this area lays outside the South China Sea, it has been a source
of comparable maritime tension), and Beijing allowing Filipino and
Vietnamese fisherman to return to the disputed Scarborough Shoal
formation, which it had blockaded since 2012.]{.underline}

Bearing these developments in mind, [there is some hope that China may
have indeed turned a corner in its South China Sea conduct. Yet, coming
as it did as the result of the application, if not the enforcement, of
international maritime law, it offers little instruction as to whether a
non-binding code of conduct between China and ASEAN will produce a
meaningful abatement of tensions]{.underline}. There is, moreover, a
risk that Beijing may use its considerable influence over the
bloc---built through economic and military might at a time when similar
US attributes seem in decline---to formulate a weak set of conditions,
which it will subsequently promote as the new standard of responsible
behavior in the region.

### China Says Yes -- ADIZ

#### China says yes -- they use ADIZs as bargaining chips to get concessions

Chinese ADIZ in the South China Sea: The Ultimate Bargaining Chip?,\"
National Interest,
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/chinese-adiz-the-south-china-sea-the-ultimate-bargaining-16335?page=2

While the world wonders whether the People's Republic of China is taking
incremental steps towards establishing an Air Defense Identification
Zone (ADIZ) in the South China Sea, [detailed analysis of Beijing's
already established ADIZ in the East China Sea seems to point to an
interesting conclusion: it may not be actively enforcing the zone and it
could be part of a sophisticated "bargaining" strategy]{.underline}. The
above concept --- and many other interesting conclusions detailing the
declared East China Sea ADIZ along with an exploration of a possible
South China Sea ADIZ --- are part of a new report released by the
US-China Economic and Security Review titled "ADIZ Update: Enforcement
in the East China Sea, [Prospects for the South China Sea]{.underline},
and Implications for the United States." The idea that Beijing might not
be enforcing its ADIZ in the East China Sea is not entirely new. Indeed,
Japanese scholars and retired defense officials on the sidelines of
conferences I have personally attended over the last several years have
also said as much. One prominent retired Japanese Defense Force official
at a conference I attended in 2014 called it "An ADIZ on paper only." 10
SECONDS Do You Know What Happened Today In History? Reinforcing such
ideas to a wider audience, the report nicely pulls together various
strands of evidence of why China declared the zone and the reasons why
enforcement today would be difficult --- even with untold billions of
dollars spent to modernize Beijing's armed forces. No Integrated
Command: Report Advertisement The report points out two big shortcoming
China would need to overcome militarily. The first is the issue of
command structure, something often overlooked. As the report explains:
"China is moving toward greater jointness in the administration of its
ADIZ. China has established a joint operations command center (JOCC) in
the East China Sea. A May 2015 report from Kanwa Defense Review---a
magazine focused on Chinese defense issues---suggests the JOCC
integrates People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force, Navy aviation, and
Army aviation forces. Administering the ADIZ through a JOCC would
facilitate the integration of radar data and the coordination of
interceptors. It is unclear when China established its East China Sea
JOCC. China previously may have lacked an integrated command center for
the administration of its ADIZ, which may have hampered China's ability
to identify, track, and intercept foreign military aircraft."
ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads Report Advertisement Radar Lacking?
The second is important radar infrastructure, which could be lacking ---
and points to greater problems in maritime and air domain awareness:
"China's network of land-based radar systems probably is broadly capable
of tracking aircraft in its ADIZ, although some analysts suggest its
effectiveness may suffer from a gap in coverage resulting from a
division of radar assets between the PLA Air Force and PLA Navy. In
addition to its land-based radar systems, China has more than a dozen
airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft that could increase
the PLA's monitoring capabilities. It is unclear to what extent AEW&C
aircraft are integrated into China's ADIZ enforcement operations. A PLA
Daily report from January 2014 indicated China planned to keep at least
one AEW&C aircraft available at all times to support the ADIZ." Rely on
'Ratchet Effect': So [if China may not have the full capability of
enforcing an ADIZ over the East China Sea, why make such a declaration
in the first place?]{.underline} Here, the report, citing research by
the always smart US Congressional Research Service, points out that:
["\[China\] may be seeking to advance its position \[in the East China
Sea\] over the long term after a short spike in tension, leaving a new
status quo with the East China Sea ADIZ in place]{.underline}. \[China\]
would acquire strategic advantage by asserting a maximalist position,
then seeming to back down, while preserving some incremental gain ---
akin to a 'ratchet' effect. According to this theory, \[China\] would
project a calm image and justify the East China Sea ADIZ as a
'reasonable' step to which foreign nations should not object. If there
is an accident, crisis, or loss of life, Beijing could then blame Tokyo,
Seoul, Taipei, or Washington." Report Advertisement In other words,
[China seemingly asserts itself with the strongest of possible
negotiating positions]{.underline} --- that of a grand ADIZ in the East
China Sea, laying down the largest of markers possible in the contested
space above the Senkaku Islands. Publicly, and most likely for purposes
of domestic politics, Beijing can take a very hard line towards its
long-time rival Japan. It has the option of enforcing the zone
selectively, just as Beijing sends various types of naval vessels near
the Senkakus to enforce its claims on the water, having the ability to
ratchet up or down the level of activity as it desires. South China Sea
Replay? Report Advertisement In times of lowered tensions or when it so
wishes, Beijing could announce it is easing restrictions in its ADIZ,
all in an effort to show it is pursuing a so-called "restrained"
approach. Or it could offer to ease restrictions as part of a bilateral
negotiation with Japan --- say limiting its ADIZ to just military and
not civilian aircraft. But as time passes, and as China's military
prowess increases, it can slowly (if it so chooses), enforce the zone
with greater confidence --- if accurate, a very smart strategy indeed.
In fact, [China loses nothing with declaring an ADIZ it may have
difficulty enforcing and looks strong]{.underline}, while Japan, South
Korea and the United States all scramble to react and look weak --- as
many perceived was as the case in late 2013. [And this would all have
repercussions in the South China Sea. Beijing could take this same
approach, declaring an ADIZ in the months or years to come, using the
same playbook as described above. Indeed, with China building islands in
the South China Sea --- with new airfields being a big part of this
approach along with radar sites and anti-aircraft batteries
---]{.underline}

DGP)

Amid recent hype about "freedom of navigation" in the South China Sea,
the US, an outspoken opponent of China's "militarisation" has been
flexing its own military muscle by [sending naval vessels and aircraft
carriers to the
region](http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2148002/us-warships-sail-near-south-china-sea-islands-move).
Four questions need to be answered to clarify the real situation.

First, what is freedom of navigation? [According to international law,
ships navigating in the territorial waters of countries other than their
own must meet the "innocent passage" requirements of the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea
([UNCLOS](http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_overview_convention.htm)).]{.underline}
[That means not using force or threatening the use of force, and not
engaging in military exercises or intelligence gathering. Although naval
ships are not subject to UNCLOS provisions of innocent passage, they are
required by many countries to obtain prior permission or provide advance
notice to enter foreign territorial waters. Such is the provision of
China's Law on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone]{.underline}.

o, freedom of navigation is not an absolute freedom to sail at will. The
US Freedom of Navigation Program should not be confused with freedom of
navigation that is universally recognised under international law. The
former is an excuse to throw America's weight about wherever it wants.
It is a distortion and a downright abuse of international law into the
"freedom to run amok". Second, is there any problem with freedom of
navigation in the South China Sea? The reality is that more than 100,000
merchant ships pass through these waters every year and none has ever
run into any difficulty with freedom of navigation. Despite [some
disputes](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/06/photos-beijings-militarisation-south-china-sea-philippines)
between China and some of its neighbours, maintaining stability in the
South China Sea has been a matter of consensus for all the countries in
this region. The overall situation has been stable, thanks to the joint
efforts of all the regional partners. Last August, for example, the
foreign ministers of China and the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (Asean) countries [agreed on the
framework](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asean-philippines-southchinasea-idUSKBN1AM0AY)
of a code of conduct. The parties have agreed to hold at least three
more rounds of consultations before the end of this year. The South
China Sea is calm and the region is in harmony. The so-called
"safeguarding freedom of navigation" issue is a bogus argument. The
reason for hyping it up could be either an excuse to get [gunboats into
the
region](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/30/south-china-sea-us-will-keep-confronting-beijing-mattis)
to make trouble, or a premeditated intervention in the affairs of the
South China Sea, instigation of discord among the parties involved and
impairment of regional stability.

The third question concerns militarisation of the [South China
Sea](https://www.theguardian.com/world/south-china-sea)[? The **US, the
self-professed opponent to "militarisation", keeps sending destroyers,
cruisers, carriers, reconnaissance flights and strategic bombers, fully
loaded with advanced offensive weapons, to this region in total
disregard of others' sovereignty and security or the peace and stability
of the area**. What is "militarisation" or "troublemaking" if not this
blatant show of force? Instead of getting this straight, some countries
followed suit by condescendingly accusing China of "not playing by the
rules". This is not only making a mess of the regional situation but
also assisting the troublemakers.]{.underline}

**[China is naturally vigilant and on guard against provocations and
needs to increase its defensive capabilities, such as building
necessary [facilities on its
islands](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/15/militarisation-beijing-south-china-sea-islands)]{.underline}**.
This is the responsibility and right of a sovereign country. These
facilities, while serving the purpose of safeguarding the sovereignty
and security of China, will also provide relevant navigational services
to ships and aircraft passing through this region and help ensure the
openness and safety of the shipping and flight routes. China is the
biggest littoral state in the South China Sea and it is firmly committed
to peaceful development, to peace and stability in the South China Sea
and to regional prosperity and growth. There is no doubt about this.

The last question is what does it take to ensure peace and stability in
the South [China](https://www.theguardian.com/world/china) Sea? A calm
and tranquil South China Sea matters directly to the prosperity and
development of China and its neighbours, who treasure peace and
stability in this region more than anyone else. Therefore it is up to
China and the Asean countries to find a solution through negotiation and
consultation among themselves.

Peace, like air and sunshine, is hardly noticed when people are
benefiting from it. But no one can live without it. China respects and
supports freedom of navigation in the South China Sea according to
international law. But freedom of navigation is not the freedom to run
amok. For those from outside the region who are flexing their muscles in
the South China Sea, the advice is this: **[if you really care about
freedom of navigation, respect the efforts of China and Asean countries
to safeguard peace and stability, stop showing off your naval ships and
aircraft to "militarise" the region, and let the South China Sea be a
sea of peace.]{.underline}**

### China Says Yes -- China Wants SEA

#### China is expanding its geoeconomic influence -- SEA integral to Chinese fopo

**[WPR 18]{.underline}** World Politics Review, 1-23-2018, \"What Role
Do Arms Sales Play in China's Geopolitical Ambitions?,\",
<https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/trend-lines/24044/what-role-do-arms-sales-play-in-china-s-geopolitical-ambitions>
Lowell-SB

China, which in recent years has become the world's third-largest
supplier of arms after the United States and Russia, continues to expand
its arms exports thanks largely to its relatively cheap weapons and
military equipment. But that has also raised questions about [how arms
sales fit into China's geopolitical ambitions, especially in
Asia]{.underline}. In an email interview, Sam Roggeveen, a senior fellow
at the Lowy Institute in Australia and an expert on the Chinese
military, discusses the growth of China's arms industry and the wider
implications for Asia.

WPR: How much has China expanded its arms trade in recent years, and
what are its major arms sales relationships?

Sam Roggeveen[: According to the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute, China is now the world's third-largest supplier of arms after
the United States and Russia. China\'s exports increased by 74 percent
between 2012 and 2016]{.underline}, and its share of global arms exports
rose from 3.8 to 6.2 percent during the same period.

China's biggest customer is Pakistan. Infamously, China's assistance to
Pakistan's nuclear program was crucial to Pakistan's nuclear weapons
breakthroughs in the 1980s. But Pakistan and China also have a
decades-long relationship in the conventional arms trade, including
large naval surface ships and more recently submarines, tanks, ballistic
missile technology and combat aircraft. Pakistan now produces the JF-17
fighter aircraft, which was co-developed with China, for the Pakistani
air force.

Beyond Pakistan, **[China has mainly had success exporting arms to
developing countries, reflecting the fact that its weapons tend to be
both cheaper and less sophisticated than those offered by American,
Russian and European rivals. For instance, China is selling fighter
aircraft to Myanmar and Bangladesh]{.underline}**, and trainer aircraft
to Zambia, Sudan and Venezuela, among many others.

But the sophistication of Chinese arms is improving, and China's
ambitions are growing. Chinese military goods are prominently displayed
at trade fairs and air shows around the world. Beijing has offered
highly capable anti-aircraft missiles for sale to Turkey, and while
Ankara did not buy them, the fact that they were offered to a NATO
member speaks to China's ambitions. It has also sold armed drones to
Saudi Arabia, a country usually known for buying top-tier Western
equipment.

WPR: [Are Chinese arms sales commercial in nature, or are they used to
advance a political or strategic agenda?]{.underline}

Roggeveen: [It is safe to assume that the answer is both,]{.underline}
though we should be careful not to confuse commercial with economic. All
arms spending is, in purely economic terms, wasteful, since military
arms either go unused or are used in massively expensive wars. Exporting
arms can only defray that cost.

[Nor should we assume that arms sales necessarily produce political
leverage or even closer political ties.]{.underline} Sweden is one of
the most successful arms exporters in the world, yet it is not obvious
that this has had political payoffs. Australia, which tends to buy
American, has also closed huge arms contracts with European
manufacturers, but its relations with Europe are slowly becoming more
distant as Australia embraces its geography and takes in more Asian
immigrants.

One last skeptical note: Arms importers have leverage of their own,
which they regularly exploit for political purposes. The recent sale of
Chinese JF-17 fighters to Myanmar, for example, was followed just this
week by news that Myanmar is buying six SU-30 fighters from Russia. The
message to Beijing ought to be clear: Myanmar is not a Chinese client
state, and if you push us too hard we can take our money elsewhere.

**[But beyond China's relationships with its customers, I think there is
a strategic agenda. China wants be a world power, and this ambition is
being advanced largely through technological means. China clearly wants
to compete with Boeing and Airbus as a maker of civilian airliners, and
it has an equally ambitious space program. It is also focused on leading
the way in artificial intelligence and computer
technology.]{.underline}** [China wants to be a world-class manufacturer
of weapons, too, and if it is going to make these weapons for its own
armed forces, it might as well export them.]{.underline}

#### SEA matters more to China than Japan -- gives US more leverage

**[Gady NO DATE]{.underline}** Franz-Stefan Gady Associate Editor with
The Diplomat, NO DATE, \"U.S. Arms Sales to Vietnam: A Military
Analysis,\" China-US Focus,
<https://www.chinausfocus.com/foreign-policy/u-s-arms-sales-to-vietnam-a-military-analysis>
Lowell-SB

**[With the recent announcement by U.S. President Barack Obama that the
United States will lift a decades-old embargo on the sale of military
equipment to Vietnam, the question arises---given that the president's
decision is partially seen as a move to counterbalance China's growing
military power in the region---in what way a U.S.-Vietnamese weapons
deal could potentially influence the military balance in the region, and
in particular, the South China Sea.]{.underline}**

[Vietnam has expressed interest in a number of used U.S. military
platforms including F-16 A/B fighter jets, refurbished P-3C Orion
maritime patrol aircraft armed with torpedoes, and unarmed unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) to be used for monitoring the country's
territorial waters and the surveilling of the larger South China
Sea]{.underline}. There have also been discussions over U.S. radar and
surveillance equipment and boosting Vietnam's electronic warfare
capabilities.

**[Any U.S. sale to Vietnam would be done under the so-called Excess
Defense Articles program]{.underline}**, which offers used U.S. military
hardware to partner nations at a reduced price and is run by the
Pentagon. Vietnam's Coast Guard is already in the process of purchasing
six U.S.-made Metal Shark Defiant 75 patrol vessels for which the United
States provided \$18 million in loans.

Leaving political issues that could unravel a U.S.-Vietnamese defense
deal aside for the moment---including lack of progress on improving
civil liberties, human rights, and holding more transparent and open
elections in Vietnam---should Hanoi opt to purchase U.S. hardware, the
impact on the fighting capabilities of the Vietnam People's Armed Forces
(VPAF) will be gradual rather than abrupt and stretch out over many
years for a number of reasons.

[For one thing, it would require putting the necessary support structure
in place for U.S. aircraft including the construction of maintenance
facilities for overhauling the planes, although larger upgrades would
still have to be done in the United States]{.underline}. It would also
require the training of pilots, ground crews, and technicians on the new
aircraft and weapons systems, which will necessitate the presence of
U.S. advisors and instructors in the country. All of this could not be
done overnight and would entail a multi-year U.S. commitment.

[However, **while the influx of U.S. military hardware in the region
will most assuredly have an impact, it remains to be seen to what extent
it will increase Vietnam's deterrence capabilities against China**---the
primary reason for any VPAF arms acquisition.]{.underline} This will
largely be dependent on two-factors: first, the level of training of
VPAF personnel on the new platforms; and second, the VPAF's ability to
integrate U.S. hardware with the rest of the military, which primarily
consists of Russian-made and Soviet legacy weapons platforms.

[Vietnam's military planning vis-à-vis China is defensive in nature and
built around A2/AD]{.underline}---or anti-access and areal denial
strategies, exploiting asymmetrical advantages by, for example, fielding
new diesel-electric submarines to exploit China's known weakness in
anti-submarine warfare. All of this requires enhanced maritime domain
awareness (MDA) and early warning systems in place and the establishment
of a so-called kill chain linking "'see-ers and shooters,'" as one
analyst recently put it.

Vietnam's ultimate goal is to deter China from deploying People's
Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) vessels in so-called gray zone coercion
scenarios, which involves the use of China Coast Guard (CCG) and
maritime militia vessels to blockade Vietnamese-held islands and
features in the South China Sea while avoiding open military conflict.

Equipment such as the refurbished P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft
armed with torpedoes would significantly increase the VPAF's deterrence
capability in that respect. Specifically, it would boost the Vietnamese
military's surface and anti-submarine warfare capabilities by
complementing its burgeoning fleet of six Russian-made 4,000-ton Type
636 Kilo-class diesel-electric submarines (five of which have been
delivered so far).

Hanoi has also been acquiring a number of anti-ship and land attack
cruise missiles, including the 3M-14E Klub supersonic cruise missile
capable of hitting mainland China, giving it an additional powerful
deterrent. Moreover, Vietnam has been upgrading its defensive missile
systems, procuring Russian-made K-300P Bastion coastal missile systems
in 2011 and S-300 PMU-2 long-range surface-to-air missile systems in
2012, in addition to upgrading coastal surveillance radar systems.

Furthermore, Vietnam operates 32 Su-30MK2V fighter aircraft optimized
for maritime support functions and equipped with the Kh-31 (AS-17
Krypton) anti-ship missiles. The Vietnam People's Air Force (VPA) is
also allegedly interested in procuring a squadron of two-engine Sukhoi
Su-35S multirole fighter jets---perhaps a more suitable aircraft for
maritime patrols than the single-engine F-16 fighter jet.

**[So could U.S. military equipment alter the military balance in the
South China Sea?]{.underline}**

**[As outlined above, this will depend on both effective training and
the ability to successfully integrate new weapons systems within
existing military structures.]{.underline}**

The paragraphs above show that Russia remains Vietnam's most important
"long-time partner in the field of bilateral military-technical
cooperation, although the relationship is not entirely frictionless," as
I noted previously. The military hardware Russia has provided Vietnam,
in comparison to U.S. systems, is more capable and has fewer strings
attached to it than Washington's offers. Vietnam also has experience in
handling Russian-made equipment for the past decades, whereas it has
none with U.S. military hardware.

When it comes to training, the VPAF has experienced limitations in the
past and is only slowly conducting more comprehensive and dynamic
exercises including practicing combined arms operations and the
integration of air, ground, and naval assets in combat operations. The
number of military-to-military training exchanges has also increased and
Vietnamese submariners are currently undergoing training in undersea
warfare doctrine and tactics at India's INS Satavahana submarine center.
Several deficiencies including in pilot training, however, remain.

While it is a possibility that Vietnam will find means to effectively
integrate U.S. systems into its Russian-hardware dominated forces, the
example of Malaysia---a country that operates both Russian and NATO
systems---shows that it is highly inefficient and costly to try to
operate both in the long run. In addition, it remains to be seen whether
Vietnam can develop new doctrines and tactics to integrate all new
weapons systems into the country's counter-intervention strategy.

[Overall, the successful integration and training on new U.S. military
platforms will most certainly increase the combat capability of the
VPAF, and as a result, will impact Chinese actions in the South China
Sea]{.underline}. However, the addition of F-16 fighter aircraft, P-3C
Orion, UAVs, and maritime intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance
(ISR) assets will not fundamentally alter the military balance between
China and Vietnam.

**[Given that a full-scale war scenario between the two countries is
unlikely, the mere presence of Vietnamese submarines in the South China
Sea, whether or not they are part of an integrated kill-chain and linked
with other military assets, will perhaps be sufficient to deter
aggressive Chinese actions in the foreseeable future.]{.underline}**

### 2NC Solvency

#### The US should leverage trade with Southeast Asia in exchange for Chinese compliance with the Code of Conduct

**[Cronin 18]{.underline}** Patrick M. Cronin, 11-15-2018, \"Asia Needs
Pence's Reassurance,\" Foreign Policy,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/11/15/asia-needs-pence-reassurance-trump-china/>
Lowell-SB

In Asia, anxieties about the United States' role in an increasingly
China-centered world are palpable. While some fear that the United
States is retreating from its international obligations, other worry
that it is bent on instigating conflict.

**[As U.S. Vice President Mike Pence visits Southeast Asia and the South
Pacific this week to attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders' meetings, he
should make clear that the United States remains a stalwart partner for
the region with a vision for peaceful cooperation and
development.]{.underline}**

No U.S. retreat

The United States is not withdrawing into fortress America. It remains
actively engaged in global affairs and is focused on strengthening the
economic and military foundations of its power. The country's central
aim is to stay competitive in a world driven by a dynamic
Indo-Asia-Pacific region. That goal, of course, derives from a real
concern that China is challenging the postwar order and an understanding
that the United States needs to find new ways to renew its diplomatic,
economic, and military competitiveness.

But as U.S. President Donald Trump said last November in Da Nang,
Vietnam, the United States has been "an active partner in this region
since we first won independence ourselves," and "we will be friends,
partners, and allies for a long time to come." U.S. Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo has likewise been a forceful advocate for diplomacy in the
region. Meanwhile, Congress is on the cusp of passing a bipartisan bill
designed to bolster U.S. engagement there. The Asia Reassurance
Initiative Act would authorize \$1.5 billion in new funding over the
next five years for regional diplomacy, development, and defense
programs.

In short, [rumors of America's disengagement miss the mark.]{.underline}

No cold war with China

**[Pence also needs to reassure the region that when it comes to China,
the United States is not seeking a war---trade, cold, or hot.Pence also
needs to reassure the region that when it comes to China, the United
States is not seeking a war---trade, cold, or hot.]{.underline}**

Instead, [the U.S. administration wants a fair, open, and cooperative
relationship. That doesn't mean ignoring China's attempts to compete
with the United States, including through grey-zone operations like
muscling the Philippines out of Scarborough Shoal and militarizing
artificial islands despite pledging not to do so.]{.underline} And
America will not shy away from meeting challenges directly. But on a
fundamental level, the Trump administration would like to channel
competition toward cooperation where possible.

In fact, [the Trump administration rejects the idea of Thucydides's
Trap: that conflict between a rising power and a status quo power is
inevitable]{.underline}. Leaders have agency, and it is up to them to
determine the future course of relations. And for its part, the United
States seeks to remain a force for good, not to contain or curb the
China's peaceful rise.

Of course, it would be useful for Pence to clarify that Washington will
not tolerate coercion or the use of force against allies and partners in
the region. But the vice president should also reiterate what he said
last month at the Hudson Institute: "America is reaching out our hand to
China. We hope that Beijing will soon reach back with deeds, not words."
That sentiment is broadly shared, even among Democrats, who do not agree
with some of the administration's tactics. (As Joaquin Castro, a
Democratic representative from Texas, said last month, China should
"compete, not cheat.")

This will be a difficult balance to strike. And here, China's approach
to the South China Sea is instructive. It alone pursues claims there
based in part on historical rights rather than contemporary
international law. It showers the region with promises of infrastructure
investment, but it fails to deliver transparent, equitably financed,
high-quality development. It promises to follow an ASEAN Code of Conduct
for the region but seeks a veto on the right of ASEAN members to extract
natural resources from the South China Sea or hold military exercises
there with Australia, Japan, the United States, and other non-ASEAN
states.

But the fear that a major confrontation, or even war, will play out in
Southeast Asia is greatly exaggerated. China seeks to advance its goals
by means short of war, and the United States aims to cooperate where it
can but compete where it must. The resumption of the Diplomatic and
Security Dialogue---a U.S.-China working group involving top defense and
diplomacy officials---is thus a good sign.

Yes to an affirmative agenda for Asia

Beyond dispelling myths about U.S. retrenchment and bellicosity, Pence
should also put forward a positive agenda for Asia. Here, he will have
to confront some of Trump administration's mistakes.

Many in the region question the United States' predictability, because
Trump has reversed major U.S. initiatives, from the Trans-Pacific
Partnership to the Paris Agreement on climate change. Meanwhile, he has
escalated tariff wars without articulating a coherent strategy for
achieving results, and his uneven application of penalties has rankled
allies and competitors alike. Nor has the administration deployed soft
power well, often ignoring U.S. values like democracy and human rights,
turning the country's back on refugees, using unbefitting language,
papering over conflicts of interest rather than cracking down hard on
corruption, and being far too comfortable with authoritarians.

Despite these missteps, **[Pence can use the trip to Asia to burnish
four cornerstones that should be the foundation of the administration's
free and open Indo-Asia-Pacific strategy, especially in Southeast Asia
and the Pacific Islands. Those four elements are a rules-based order,
sustainable economic development, inclusive diplomacy, and effective
security cooperation]{.underline}**.

First, **[upholding and peacefully adapting the set of rules chosen
freely by strong and independent sovereign states will be the foundation
for U.S. engagement with the region. The United States has enduring
interests in the South China Sea: stability, freedom of navigation, and
resolving disputes peacefully and without coercion.]{.underline}**

[Although ensuring the rule of law will require far more than freedom of
navigation operations, the United States will continue to help maintain
the openness of the seas by sailing, flying, and operating anywhere
international law permits. Importantly, seafaring nations from Asia and
Europe are also demonstrating their commitment to the same cause by
conducting similar operations.]{.underline}

Second, for growth to be sustainable, it has to be fair and reciprocal.
It should be pursued in a manner that is transparent, noncoercive, and
environmentally sustainable, especially when it comes to the global
maritime commons. There is nothing wrong with China's Belt and Road
Initiative that sunshine and high standards of accountability cannot
fix.

**[Meanwhile, the United States should go even further to mobilize
public and private support for trade, investment, and
development.]{.underline}** [Eventually, the country can create a whole
constellation of allies and partners that can invest in energy
infrastructure, digital connectivity, transportation, and more**. For
instance, the United States is in active discussions to leverage the
BUILD Act to expand joint efforts with allies and partners in the
Philippines, Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, and
elsewhere. In doing so, it can set a gold standard for development in
the region.**]{.underline}

Take Indonesia for example. China aside, a prosperous, democratic, and
stable Indonesia is in the vital interest of the United States. Yet few
in Washington are aware of the opportunities that await in Southeast
Asia's most populous country. The U.S. government's Millennium Challenge
Corporation has just completed a successful economic investment in
Indonesia. Pence should ensure Washington starts negotiating a follow-on
compact while simultaneously using BUILD Act funds to facilitate new
U.S. private sector entry into Indonesia.

A third tenet of U.S. policy in Southeast Asia is inclusive diplomacy,
including trust-building with competitors and partners alike.

[ASEAN deserves broad support for its unique convening authority.
Certainly, that is a major reason why the United States embraces the
body having a loud unified voice in Indo-Pacific engagement. It also is
in favor a strong, binding Code of Conduct---not one that unfairly
limits the freedom of action of Southeast Asian states.]{.underline}

Inclusive confidence-building measures, such as plans to extend the
voluntary Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea to include coast guard
vessels and efforts to protect rapidly depleted fishery stocks, deserve
action. The United States should signal its support for promoting a new
framework of "Resilience, Response, Recovery," which is one of several
useful concepts being put forward by ASEAN under Singapore's
chairmanship. At the same time, ASEAN members are pragmatic. The United
States will often have to cooperate with them on a bilateral or
trilateral basis to find effective responses to real challenges.

In terms of diplomacy with China, it might be worth creating a new
crisis avoidance mechanism---perhaps mirroring the 1972 Incidents at Sea
agreement. The bilateral pact did not prevent all U.S.-Soviet mishaps,
but it helped avert major disasters, something that is even more
important in a region where intermediate-range cruise missiles,
hypersonic weapons, and the military use of cyberspace and outer space
are unrestricted.

Finally, the United States will continue to support effective security
cooperation centered on information sharing, capacity building, and
interoperability. The United States should buttress such efforts by
firming up its commitment to respond appropriately to threats of
coercion and the use of force.

Boosting the ability of allies and partners to see better what is
happening in their maritime backyards will help them become more
resilient. And assistance with capacity building, especially for coast
guards and other law enforcement agencies, will give nations a better
ability to protect their sovereignty. Bilateral, "minilateral," and
larger multilateral exercises can also help create a readiness for
dealing with future contingencies.

In sum, a confident but not boastful United States is neither stepping
away from Asia nor trying to provoke wars there. Rather, it aims to
ensure stability in the region so that all countries there can advance
both sovereign interests and regional cooperation.

#### The US should use trade with Southeast Asia to diplomatically resolve tensions in the SCS

**[Cronin 16]{.underline}** Patrick M. Cronin is a Former Senior Advisor
and Senior Director, Asia-Pacific Security Program, 11-10-2016, \"Power
and Order in the South China Sea,\" Center for a New American Security,
<https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/power-and-order-in-the-south-china-sea>
Lowell-SB

[The South China Sea problem is often reduced to a question about
U.S.-China relations. The U.S. response to such reductionism must be to
push back and remind all that this important bilateral relationship is
complex and certainly bigger than just one body of water**. The U.S.
foreign policy establishment understands that the world benefits from a
just and orderly peace**]{.underline}. Despite resurgent major-power
competition that in coming years will likely manifest itself in the
South China Sea, the United States is committed to expanding cooperative
relations with all nations. Relations with two Asian powers, Japan and
India, have arguably never been better. Washington has also has moved
recently to buttress close transatlantic ties, although the European
Union is under new duress in the wake of Britain's Brexit vote.
Resurgent competition with Russia and China, however, are clearly part
of the emerging global security environment, and a sharp deterioration
in those relations could well be increasingly felt in Southeast Asia.
**[But for all the concerns that exist about China-U.S. relations, the
overall relationship continues to be bounded by complex
interdependencies]{.underline}**. Russia, which has pursued territorial
expansion by annexing the Crimea and maneuvering in and around Ukraine,
and which has a small economic footprint compared with that of China,
offers both more direct challenges and fewer opportunities for
cooperation. Even worse, Russian-U.S. tensions appear to be rising
faster than those between China and the United States because of the
mindset, objectives, and modus operandi of President Vladimir Putin.24
Even so, Moscow and Washington cooperated on the Iran nuclear accord and
persist in efforts to stabilize Syria and contain or defeat the Islamic
State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).

[If resurgent major-power relations are complex, the U.S. commitment to
a positive, internationalist role in the world also appears less assured
than before the 2016 presidential election]{.underline}. Never in recent
history has a major political party nominee so carelessly called for
disregarding elementary U.S. promissory obligations, whether with
respect to trade accords, treaties, or torture. Even if this was mere
campaign rhetoric, it has created considerable damage to the reputation
of the United States. The good news is that after the election, a new
administration will have to focus on the challenges of governing[. When
it does, it is likely to settle on the necessity of preserving and
adapting an inclusive, rules-based order, an order that will badly need
reinforcement in the South China Sea. Furthermore, it will undoubtedly
see the necessity of a foreign policy, especially in Asia where the
United States will remain a permanent Pacific power, led by economic and
diplomatic policy instruments undergirded by military
prowess.]{.underline}

Because the world is not self-regulating, the United States will
continue to pursue complex relations of cooperation and competition from
a foundation of comprehensive strength. Still, the elements of power
need to be rebalanced. All too often the United States appears as a
unidimensional power, focused on military might and insufficiently
attentive to economic instruments of power. The recent book by Robert
Blackwill and Jennifer Harris, War by Other Means, provides a timely
corrective to the Washington discourse. [The authors admonish the United
States to rediscover geoeconomics, meaning a renewed emphasis on
"economic instruments to defend national interests and produce
beneficial geopolitical results."25 **Trade, investment, energy,
finance, and development assistance, among other economic policy tools,
should be at the heart of U.S. engagement in Asia and globally. At the
same time, issues such as climate change, the environment, and even
terrorism need to be foregrounded for their geoeconomic implications of
U.S., regional, and global stability.**]{.underline}

In reality, the United States is focused on economic growth, creating
better jobs with better wages, and doing all this while sustaining the
one planet on which we all live. U.S. relations with China, like those
with Southeast Asia and all nations in the Asia-Pacific region, are
grounded in mutually beneficial economic exchange. Where the benefits
are not fair and mutual, issues must be addressed. **[But overall
economic interdependence, as Princeton University's China and the World
program director Thomas Christensen has written, moderates major-power
relations and dampens the desire to resort to force to settle disputes.
Despite a growing wariness about China, Christensen's contention---that
the United States would do better to persuade China over time to align
its growth to world order than to prepare to fight over it---remains the
preponderant wisdom in U.S. policy circles.26 Although persuasion may at
times entail risk, this need not and should not ignite
conflict.]{.underline}** Writes Christensen, while "deterring Chinese
aggression toward its neighbors and the United States will be
increasingly challenging . . . China has major incentives to avoid
unnecessary conflict, and after decades of a global Cold War, the United
States government is highly experienced in the practice of coercive
diplomacy."27

#### Trade and diplomacy key to solve

**[Cronin 16]{.underline}** Patrick M. Cronin is a Former Senior Advisor

3\. The United States needs, in its next iteration of strategic
engagement with Asia, to adopt a greater reliance on geoeconomic
instruments of power.

[A dominant, integrated focus on the blue economy that includes not only
trade and energy flows but also the basic connectivity of money,
information, people, resources, and goods through, under, and over the
South China Sea will help U.S. policymakers remember the main purpose
for which preserving peace and stability is important]{.underline}. At
the same time they will be encouraging connections with the people of
this diverse region in ways far more agreeable than that implied in the
common narrative of growing U.S.-China strategic competition. [The new
U.S. administration should fully utilize the opportunity afforded by
Vietnam's role as the host of the 2017 APEC summit to instill new vigor
in that inclusive and economically focused forum by applying a few of
the better ideas emerging from TPP negotiations.]{.underline}

4\. Even a more economic, diplomatic, and legal approach to the South
China Sea must remain undergirded with genuine and powerful military
capabilities.

The forthcoming CNAS report "Counterbalance: Towards a Rebalance Defense
Strategy in the Asia-Pacific" captures the four lines of effort that the
U.S. Defense Department has deployed to preserve strategic power in
Asia: presence and force posture, partner capacity building, military
modernization, and innovative concepts of operation.**[44 The lines of
effort remain valid, but the United States needs to ensure that it
carefully weighs the balance between short-term presence and long-term
capability, both with respect to national military power and the
combined power of a wider network of allies and partners]{.underline}**.

5\. The United States needs to strengthen the central direction and
coordination of all policy tools.

[The quadripartite constellation of military, diplomatic, legal, and
economic power can be parsed separately to identify specific challenges
and responses. Indeed, this is the standard U.S. governmental approach,
which can pay lip service to the overall government philosophy but
fundamentally preserves authorities, budgets, and policies for
individual departments and agencies]{.underline}. Yet if integrated or
at least pursued in tandem, nurtured, and strengthened, these four
pillars can increase strategic influence. In turn, if used wisely, this
methodology offers U.S. officials the best foundation on which to
protect U.S. interests and promote American values. With a more
integrated U.S. policy approach, Washington can and should then seek a
more balanced strategic blueprint, based on both geopolitical and
geoeconomic concerns and tools, with core regional allies.

#### US key to use arm sales as leverage over SEA countries to deescalate growing security dilemma -- complete cutoff can't solve

American Enterprise Institute (AEI), where he analyzes US defense policy

The South China Sea and terrorism tend to dominate discussions of
security in Southeast Asia, and rightly so. Conflicts among ASEAN
states, however, persist as threats to regional stability, even if they
are only secondary in nature. Historical animosities have remained
problematic, especially as they intersect with territorial disputes.
Meanwhile, [military modernization efforts across the region, while
necessary]{.underline}, may inadvertently contribute to a less stable
security environment. Richard Bitzinger argues that these efforts
[amount to an "arms competition," rather than an arms race]{.underline},
with implications for regional security. In particular, continued
purchases of advanced weapon platforms [may contribute to a classical
"security dilemma"---a situation whereby actions taken by a country can
actually undermine the security and stability that they were meant to
increase]{.underline}. In this case, arms acquisitions by one state,
even if it has no desire to threaten its neighbours, can often lead to
anxieties and insecurities being felt by nearby states. Reciprocal
responses by neighbouring states to "regain" security by buying their
own advanced weapons often only raise regional tensions further. Even
defensively oriented weapons purchases, such as air defences or lightly
armed offshore patrol vessels, may be perceived as threatening, as they
could conceivably be employed in anti-access/area denial operations in
the event of conflict. Finally, [even if such tit-for-tat arms purchases
do not lead to conflict, they can reinforce mutual insecurities and
suspicions, and ultimately have a deleterious impact on regional
security.]{.underline}48 Arms procurements that may be necessary to
update or replace aging equipment in response to Chinese actions may
understandably be considered with wariness by neighbors. Use of such
arms to shape a security environment that China has unsettled could,
unintentionally or not, unsettle others' security perceptions[. For the
United States, the proper response is not to cut off its own arms sales
to the region or encourage others to do so. Rather, the United States
should seek to proactively shape the security environment in ways
conducive to regional peace and stability, such that Southeast Asians
need not conclude they must do so entirely on their own.]{.underline}
Second, the United States should make its good offices available to
regional states in need of mediation should ASEAN fail to maintain
intraregional peace, as has happened in the past. Washington's ability
to contain discord between third parties is limited---consider relations
between Japan and South Korea, two of America's closest allies---but
mitigating the conditions that may lead to conflict is, at least in some
instances, in America's reach.

### Vietnam Key---1NC/2NC

#### Getting Vietnam on board is key to get the gang together in southeast asia - k2 the china-asean SCS code of conduct

**[Quang 19]{.underline}** Nguyen Minh Quang , The Diplomat, 6-29-2019,
\"Saving the China-ASEAN South China Sea Code of Conduct,\" Diplomat,
<https://thediplomat.com/2019/06/saving-the-china-asean-south-china-sea-code-of-conduct/>
Lowell-SB

In the absence of a legally-binding mechanism in the South China Sea,
ASEAN will have to further upgrade relations with external powers, in
part due to the desire to lesson political and economic dependence on
China and in part due to worries about China's massive expansion in the
region. But the foremost thing ASEAN needs is greater self-reliance,
which requires substantial unity and a new approach to the
consensus-based decision-making process. Self-reliance empowers ASEAN to
protect its collective values and peoples without compromising the ASEAN
Community for individual members' own national interests.

[While it is unlikely that China will be willing to ratify a
legally-binding COC, opportunities exist to build self-reliance and
leadership capacity to solve threats to dispute management within the
littoral ASEAN states]{.underline}. The "ASEAN minus X" framework can
empower a few littoral member states to proactively initiate and
implement their own marine security cooperation and collective defense
mechanism to protect their fishermen and maritime zones as provided for
and established in accordance with the 1982 UNCLOS; assist law
enforcement; combat terrorism; and challenge China's efforts to
normalize its unilateral policies and control in the South China Sea.
Such a strategy would be a counterbalance in the region, necessary for
the region's self-reliance in security and defense. This is also a key
opportunity for external players to support ASEAN's self-reliant
security building and show their determination to curb China's gray-zone
coercion.

Deepening political will and strategic trust is also the key to ASEAN
unity. However, political will in ASEAN to take cooperative action on
the South China Sea issue is impeded by low levels of mutual
understanding and a lack of consensus at the interministerial level, and
the absence of a convening body to champion the South China Sea dispute
issues both inside and outside of ASEAN.

[Vietnam is a natural starting point for self-reliance building in ASEAN
in 2020. **Vietnam's geopolitical position as both a frontline claimant
in the South China Sea and a foremost victim of military miscalculation
or conflict escalation uniquely motivates it to support peaceful dispute
management approaches. Sustained rapid economic development means that
Vietnam will be one of the major production bases and the emerging
hotspot of regional integration, and this strong economic linkage acts a
bargaining chip at the regional dialogue leve**l. Vietnam was recently
voted as a nonpermanent member of the United Nations Security Council
(UNSC) for the 2020-2021 term and at the same time will take up the
ASEAN chairmanship in 2020, which provide ample opportunity to take a
stronger leadership role on stability maintenance and security issues in
the region. Lastly, Vietnam's stable government institutions and growing
network of diplomatic initiatives with strong historical partners in
ASEAN and emerging strategic partnerships with external actors such as
the United States, India, and Japan make it an ideal platform for
enhancing regional dialogue and promoting progressive COC
negotiations.]{.underline}

[Vietnam therefore has an opportunity to propose which kind of
approaches, including the "ASEAN minus X," will progress during
ASEAN-China COC talks. The costs associated with a nonbinding COC and
diverging ASEAN in the South China Sea could be far-reaching and
outweigh the values of peace, stability, and inclusive development that
international interests and littoral ASEAN peoples demand]{.underline}.
ASEAN leaders and think-tanks may recognize this, but preparing to
accept Chinese hegemony in the region or becoming more assertive in
employing UNCLOS and international norms to oppose China's coercive
actions won't be an easy choice.

### ADIZ Bad -- Yes IL/Impact

#### ADIZ is Bad -- supports Chinese territory claim and expansionism, against freedom of overflight, threatens commercial flights

Sea: The Case Against an ADIZ. The Diplomat.

DGP**)**]{.underline}

Following the Permanent Court of Arbitration's (PCA) unanimous ruling
undermining the legal basis for China's "nine-dash line" claim, Beijing
repeated its prior threat to establish an aircraft defense
identification zone (ADIZ) above the South China Sea (SCS). An ADIZ is
an area of airspace, adjacent to but beyond the national airspace and
territory of the state, where aircraft are identified, monitored, and
controlled in the interest of national security.

Presumably the purpose of a South China Sea ADIZ would be to reinforce
China's territorial claims -- a tangible rejoinder to the PCA's award
and international criticism. In November 2014, Beijing established an
ADIZ over the East China Sea ("ECS ADIZ") encompassing disputed maritime
territory. The ADIZ could also serve as a means of excluding and
deterring U.S. freedom of navigation operations, which include military
flights designed to challenge excessive claims to maritime jurisdiction.
[China has developed a series of landing strips on reclaimed land in the
contested Spratly archipelago that could be used to enforce the
ADIZ.]{.underline}

[However, a Chinese ADIZ above the South China Sea, in addition to
aggravating tensions, would be misguided as a matter of international
law and mistaken as a matter of policy.]{.underline} ADIZs are creatures
of customary international law, the implementation of which are
conditioned by principles derived from the inherent right of
self-defense and treaties such as the Convention on International Civil
Aviation (Chicago Convention) and United Nations Convention on the Law
of the Sea (UNCLOS). Although more than 20 states, including the United
States, have established ADIZs, these limited defensive zones have not
been used for the greater lawfare ends potentially envisioned by
Beijing. An examination of the fundamental elements of ADIZs, reveals
the folly of such an approach.

First, the role of ADIZs is to provide a means of anticipatory
self-defense from incoming and immediate threats emanating above the
high seas. [The ADIZ is a modern variant and extension of the
"cannon-shot" rule, which provided for a buffer zone in coastal waters
based on the reach of littoral defenses]{.underline}. During the Cold
War, the United States established the first ADIZs as a means of
protecting the homeland from the inbound threat posed by long-range
Soviet bombers. [Employing an ADIZ to aggrandize disputed maritime
claims would deviate from state practice and encroach upon the rights of
all states in the high seas]{.underline}. **[In this scenario, the legal
rationale of ADIZs would be essentially reversed from defensive to
offensive, from the protection of national sovereignty to the coercive
extension of sovereignty.]{.underline}**

Second, [ADIZs can only be legally applied in relation to preventing the
unauthorized entry of aircraft into the national airspace]{.underline}.
**[ADIZs cannot be used to control foreign aircraft not intending to
enter the national airspace.]{.underline}** [States only enjoy exclusive
sovereignty over the airspace above their territory]{.underline}, a
right which ends at the 12 nautical mile border of the territorial sea.
Beyond this territorial belt**[, all states enjoy the high seas
freedoms, including freedom of overflight, a customary principle
memorialized in UNCLOS]{.underline}**. These limitations may frustrate
Beijing's broad design. For example, even if China ignores the PCA's
ruling and could validly claim that Fiery Cross Reef, site of
large-scale Chinese reclamation activities, is an "island" entitled to a
territorial sea, Beijing could not prevent U.S. military aircraft from
traversing the adjacent international airspace.

Third, establishment of an [ADIZ must follow standard notice and
coordination procedures]{.underline}. The Chicago Convention mandates
timely and structured cooperation prior to establishing security zones
in order to mitigate risks to civil aviation such as hazardous aircraft
interceptions. In addition, the procedures used to identify, locate, and
control aircraft in ADIZs are similar to those used by states assigned
authority, under the Chicago Convention, for providing air traffic
services in international airspace. For instance, the Philippines is
responsible for providing air traffic services within the Manila Flight
Information Region (FIR), an area that includes large swaths of airspace
in the South China Sea[. In the case of the ECS ADIZ, Beijing
unilaterally established the zone without engaging or communicating with
stakeholders in the region through established channels]{.underline}.
Similarly, since a South China Sea ADIZ would be a rebuke to competing
claimants, it is doubtful that China would seek prior input from or
collaborate with neighboring states like the Philippines. A **[Chinese
ADIZ that overlaps with existing air traffic regions in the South China
Sea could lead to surprise, miscalculation, and the threat of force
against commercial carriers]{.underline}**. Beijing would be correctly
blamed for any resulting catastrophe.

Fourth, states purport to apply ADIZs to both civil and state aircraft,
an often problematic distinction under international law. Following the
Korean Airlines Flight 007 incident in which a Soviet fighter jet shot
down a scheduled commercial aircraft, killing all 269 persons on board,
the Chicago Convention was amended to expressly prohibit the use of
weapons against civil aircraft in flight. However, [identifying whether
a particular flight qualifies as one by "state aircraft" or "civil
aircraft" is subject to interpretation]{.underline} and inconsistently
applied. This uncertainty has led to controversy regarding whether the
Chicago Convention's protective cover applies to specific flights in
international airspace. Following the establishment of the ECS ADIZ,
China sought to reassure commercial airlines that normal flights would
not be disrupted even though the official rules published by Beijing
allowed for this scenario. Unsurprisingly, however, when China turned
back Lao Airlines Flight QV916 on July 25, 2015, initial reports
mistakenly concluded that Beijing had enforced the ECS ADIZ. **[A South
China Sea ADIZ would only increase the risk of confusion and
miscommunication, thereby inhibiting one of the world's great transit
lanes]{.underline}**.

Fifth, [states enforce ADIZs through military interception, which
ultimately may lead to the threat or application of force against
non-compliant aircraft]{.underline}. In September 2015, the United
States and China concluded Annex III to the Memorandum of Understanding
On the Rules of Behavior for the Safety of Air and Maritime Encounters.
The parties agreed to actions and maneuvers to prevent collisions
between U.S. and Chinese military aircraft, including interception
procedures. This document, however, is neither legally binding nor
applicable to third parties. A state's legal ability to use force
against intrusions of sovereign territorial airspace is much broader
than the right to self-defense in international airspace. How would
China view ADIZ enforcement in the South China Sea? In the ECS ADIZ,
[Chinese interceptor aircraft have breached international
norms]{.underline}, endangering safety by reportedly coming within 200
feet of Japanese military reconnaissance aircraft. [Needless to say, an
accident or incident involving a Chinese military interception would
contravene commitments of self-restraint and the peaceful resolution of
disputes,]{.underline} as set forth in the 2002 Declaration on the
Conduct (DOC) of Parties in the South China Sea.

Sixth, although ADIZs have extensive temporal and geographic range,
international law establishes important parameters on their scope. For
instance, the Contiguous U.S. ADIZ extends more than 400 miles into the
Pacific Ocean and has been in place for more than fifty years. However,
even U.S. [ADIZs must not unduly interfere with high seas freedoms or
exceed the functional jurisdiction associated with maritime zones under
UNCLOS]{.underline}. With regard to an economic exclusive zone (EEZ),
the coastal state has "sovereign rights" for the purpose of exploiting
and managing natural resources, but an EEZ does not generate new
security rights, including in relation to the international airspace
above. Nevertheless, during the E-P3 incident of April 1, 2001, in which
a Chinese fighter collided with a U.S. reconnaissance aircraft flying
above China's EEZ, Beijing attempted to link novel security rights with
UNCLOS maritime zones. Importantly, the scope of an ADIZ must be
measured by principles of self-defense: Is the area covered and the
indefinite duration of the zone necessary and proportional to the actual
threat presented? As Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin recently
acknowledged, an ADIZ depends on the threat. In the Nicaragua case, the
International Court of Justice (ICJ) held that U.S. naval maneuvers in
the immediate vicinity, but beyond Nicaragua's territorial sea did not
constitute a prohibited threat or use of force. Extending this logic,
U.S. freedom of navigation operations above the international waters of
the South China Sea would not serve as a credible basis for enforcing a
Chinese ADIZ.

[Even if China were to use an ADIZ for a sui generis prescriptive
purpose, there is the significant problem of configuring the zone to
align with Beijing's broad, yet inconsistent claims.]{.underline} Would
the ADIZ surround the nine-dash line, thereby encompassing the entirety
of the South China Sea, or would the zone merely safeguard various
Chinese-claimed islands and features, a slight but definitive
concession? The ECS ADIZ roughly corresponds with China's EEZ and covers
the disputed Senkaku Islands, but what value -- legal, tactical or
otherwise -- has this measure brought to China? According to a U.S.
Congressional report, the [ECS ADIZ is more bluster than actual
buffer]{.underline}. Unlike aggressive, but temporary military
exercises, an ADIZ would be a near-permanent policy prescription in the
South China Sea. Any strategic gain from Chinese ambiguity would be
lost, the diplomatic off-ramps narrowed and the ill-conceived nature of
the policy revealed. [An ADIZ would become another spurious boundary to
defend in the turbulent South China Sea]{.underline}.

[China triggered an uproar when it established its "first"]{.underline}
Air Defense Identification Zone ([ADIZ]{.underline}) [over the East
China Sea in 2013, and concern is mounting that it may establish a
second in the hotly-disputed South China Sea. China's first ADIZ was
contentious for three reasons. First, China did not consult with its
neighbours before it announced the zone]{.underline} (a well-established
norm). [Second, China's new ADIZ overlapped with existing Japanese,
Korean, and Taiwanese zones]{.underline} (the East China Sea is the only
region in the world where ADIZs overlap). [Third, China's zone included
the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, administered by Japan but claimed by China,
and the submerged Socotra Rock claimed by China and South
Korea]{.underline}. The East China Sea is the only place in the world
where ADIZs include contested territory. Image: China's territorial
claims (nine dashed line) in the South China Sea and neighbouring
countries' Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), as well as currently
disputed territory (Source: BBC News, "Q&A: South China Sea dispute")
Let us hope that all of the parties with stakes in the South China Sea
see the value of avoiding a more dangerous replay of the first ADIZ
crisis in 2013.﻿ There is nothing in international law that prohibited
China's move. In fact, [international law is completely silent on the
subject of ADIZs. This lack of codification means that ADIZ governance
is essentially left up to each state. As a result, practices are
inconsistent]{.underline}. ADIZs are also badly misunderstood, at least
by journalists and policy makers. China's insistence that aircraft
merely transiting its ADIZ report in advance, for example, was sharply
criticized as "unusual," when in fact it is common. Even the United
States---China's most vocal critic---requires this. The same thing may
soon happen again in the South China Sea, and if it does, it will make
the first ADIZ flap look like child's play. [The South China Sea is home
to some of the most dangerous maritime and territorial disputes in the
world involving hundreds of small islands and half a dozen rival
claimants. It is also a vital artery of the global economy]{.underline}.
Analysts generally consider it one of the most important and most
dangerous global flashpoints. [From Beijing's point of view, the most
logical demarcation of a South China Sea ADIZ would be the famous
Nine-Dashed Line]{.underline}, which China uses to define the outer
limit of its jurisdiction. The Nine-Dashed Line essentially encompasses
the entire South China Sea and overlaps the territorial seas and/or
Exclusive Economic Zones of Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and the
Philippines. While China has not stated specifically exactly what rights
it claims within the Nine-Dashed Line (territorial sovereignty
certainly; maritime jurisdiction less certainly), [if indeed Beijing
understands an ADIZ as a tool for sovereignty assertion, anything less
would seem inconsistent and might be interpreted domestically or
internationally as a retreat]{.underline}. Certainly the massive land
reclamation project upon which China is currently engaged will give
China the capability to monitor the entire area, and potentially also to
scramble interceptors rapidly. [If China did seek to impose an ADIZ over
the entire South China Sea, it would overlap with the Philippines'
current ADIZ, and it is a safe bet that Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei
would counter with ADIZs of their own. A new, expansive ADIZ in the
South China Sea would be detrimental to China, to regional stability,
and to aviation safety around the world until and unless ADIZs in
general return to their pre-2013 quietude]{.underline}.

#### ADIZ is bad for all of Southeast Asia-Has violent implications

Studies. ]{.underline}

What is [China's next big move in the South China]{.underline} Sea? Ask
the experts this question and tally their predictions. The action that
will get the most [votes is likely to be the imposition of an air
defense identification zone (ADIZ). Indeed, a widespread view among the
South China Sea watchers is that China will sooner or later declare an
ADIZ in this semi-closed maritime domain, where it has reclaimed
thousands of acres of land to build long airstrips, high-frequency
radars, stationed combat aircraft and long-range missiles.]{.underline}

This view is undergirded by [two assumptions. The first is that Beijing
is willing to accept high costs, while an ADIZ will bring enormous
benefits to China. The second assumption is that there will be a moment
when circumstances raise either the costs for China's rivals to
retaliate, the benefits for China to impose an ADIZ, or both.
Consequently, declaring an ADIZ is a matter of timing, as China is
waiting for the opportunity that maximizes the cost-benefit ratio of
this action.]{.underline} From this perspective, the idea of an ADIZ is
particularly attractive when the hands of China's rivals are tied or
when an ADIZ can prevent or compensate for some of China's anticipated
losses. Such an opportunity is looming large in these months as the
Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague is expected to reject
China's nine-dash line, the central basis of Beijing's maritime claims
in the South China Sea[. Not only can an ADIZ fill in an important part
of the legal vacuum that will emerge if the nine-dash line is widely
believed as illegal; an ADIZ can impose more restrictions than the
nine-dash line.]{.underline} Adding to this estimation is a recent
report citing sources close to the Chinese military as saying that China
is preparing an ADIZ in the South China Sea.

So, is a Chinese ADIZ in the South China Sea really a matter of time?
The answer appears to be affirmative, until you ask a different
question: Can China's rivals prevent an ADIZ in the South China Sea? An
investigation into the latter question suggests that [China's ADIZ in
the South China Sea is not a matter of timing but one of
interaction]{.underline}. More specifically[, China's rivals hold
powerful cards in this game, and some of the cards in Vietnam's hands
may be formidable enough to deter China from formally declaring an ADIZ
in this region]{.underline}. What might be the reaction of key players
to China's South China Sea ADIZ? As a non-claimant, [the United States
has limited options]{.underline}. In a similar way to its actions
against China's East China Sea ADIZ two years ago, Washington can send
its bombers and fighters to the area to register its rejection of
China's decision. Washington can also deploy more assets to the region,
increase the number of its patrols and dispatch its vessels and aircraft
closer to the Chinese-held islands. But [even if the United States could
triple its military presence from the current level of seven hundred
trips a year, this would still be no match to the hundreds of Chinese
armed vessels that are the region's permanent residents]{.underline}.

The Philippines has few options left after already having used some of
its strong cards. Manila has launched a legal action against China in
the Permanent Court of Arbitration, and it has allowed Washington to use
five of its air and land bases. If China imposes an ADIZ, however, the
Philippines and the United States can upgrade their Enhanced Defense
Cooperation Agreement, and add the three naval bases initially offered
by Manila but not taken by Washington to the list of places that can be
used by U.S. rotational forces. Two of these three are Naval Station
Carlito Cunanan in Ulugan Bay on the western coast of Palawan Island and
Naval Station San Miguel in Zambales Province. While Carlito Cunanan is
the major naval base closest to the center of the Spratly Islands, San
Miguel is the naval base closest to Scarborough Shoal. These two bases
can immensely enhance the U.S. Navy's ability to respond to
contingencies in the South China Sea. Malaysia and Vietnam can follow in
the Philippines' footsteps and take China to court, as well as grant
Washington more and better access to their naval and air facilities
along the South China Sea coast. In this regard, Vietnam has far more
potential than Malaysia to make China hesitate to declare an ADIZ. While
Malaysian bases such as Labuan and Bintulu lie in the far south, Cam
Ranh Bay and Da Nang on Vietnam's central coast offer the best locations
to neutralize the effects of China's artificial islands in the Spratlys
and Paracels.

And with its longer and more impressive record of China's aggression in
the South China Sea, Vietnam can put enormous pressure on Beijing if it
files a lawsuit against its giant neighbor. Although Hanoi shied away
from suing China in the past, a Chinese ADIZ that impinges on Vietnam's
airspace can be the straw that breaks the camel's back. Commenting on a
possible [Chinese ADIZ in the South China]{.underline} Sea, Vietnam's
top defense diplomat Gen. Nguyen Chi Vinh said that [it would be "more
dangerous than even the nine-dash line"]{.underline} and it would "kill"
Vietnam. Finally, the Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam can declare
their own ADIZ to reciprocate against China's. This in-kind response is
politically more feasible than granting the United States access to
bases and launching a legal action against China. The legal action
requires that Vietnam and Malaysia have exhausted other diplomatic
means. Domestic and ideological concerns in both countries are likely to
limit the access granted to Washington to an extent insufficient to
deter China. But even a combination of a Malaysian and a Philippine ADIZ
would not really hurt China. Poor enforcement aside, they would not
change the basic terms of the bargain with Beijing.

Contrarily, a Vietnamese ADIZ that covers the Paracel Islands could
cause the damage that China would rather avoid. While China acknowledges
a dispute over the Spratlys, it denies any dispute over the Paracels. A
Vietnamese ADIZ, although not a territorial claim itself, and likely to
be poorly enforced, can create some sort of Vietnamese administration
over the Paracels, something that China has eliminated since 1974.
What's more, it can also provide a legal basis for Vietnam to carry out
actions that can be interpreted as exercising sovereignty over the
islands. The above analysis shows that China's ADIZ in the South China
Sea is not a matter of timing; rather, it critically depends on how
China's rivals will react to it. In this game of poker, the United
States, the Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam hold some strong cards,
though China can also up the ante. Some of the most formidable cards lie
in Vietnam's hands. Imposing an ADIZ over the Paracels and granting U.S.
forces regular access to some strategic places on Vietnam's Central
Coast can be game changers. If credibly signaled, they can deter China
from declaring a formal ADIZ in the South China Sea. But Beijing can
bet, for good reasons, that Hanoi (and Washington) may regard them not
worth the risk. In any case, decisions in Hanoi can switch decisions in
Beijing.

#### Chinese ADIZ is bad. ECS proves. To solve for SCS China and the US need to collaborate

In the near future the U.S. Navy (USN) reportedly will sail within 12
nautical miles of islands claimed by China in the South China Sea (SCS).
This is welcome news for those who believe that Washington's weakness in
the face of China's "blatantly illegal" island reclamation campaign has
encouraged Beijing's bad behavior. Now the question is: what comes next?
The idea that FONOPS will rein in Chinese actions in the SCS is
appealing. Administration critics charge that China has been making all
the right moves to bolster its territorial claims while the United
States sits on its hands. However, FONOPS will not resolve SCS
territorial disputes. In fact, this approach likely will complicate
U.S.-Chinese relations and make a peaceful settlement of territorial
disputes more difficult. Past Performance Does Not Guarantee Future
Results Those who believe a show of force by Washington will bring
Beijing to heel point to the East China Sea. In November [2013 the
Chinese government announced an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ)
over most of the East China Sea, including the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu
Islands. Beijing demanded that aircraft flying through the ADIZ identify
themselves and warned that China's armed forces would "adopt defensive
emergency measures" against noncompliant aircraft.]{.underline} Three
days later the U.S. Air Force sent two B-52 bomber aircraft through the
ADIZ, resulting in little more than Chinese finger wagging. Relative
calm ensued in the skies above the East China Sea. Japan and South Korea
flew military aircraft through the ADIZ without incident and the
American military reported no changes in its interactions with the
Chinese military. Tensions eventually rose when the PLA Air Force
(PLAAF) began enforcing the ADIZ, but the East China Sea generally has
been peaceful. At the start of 2015, for example, Chinese aviation
authorities announced that they would not take "defensive emergency
measures" against civilian aircraft that did not recognize the ADIZ.
Superficially, then, the initial B-52 flight appeared to force China to
back down from its overzealous territorial claims. However, a host of
other factors influenced China's decision not to aggressively defend the
ADIZ. First, the PLAAF lacked sufficient military capabilities to do so.
Second, Beijing recognized that the ADIZ undermined the diplomatic
goodwill that President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang were building
in the region. Third, Japan mounted a firm response to the ADIZ,
demonstrating its willingness to stand up for itself. The planned FONOP
in the SCS is unlikely to produce a similar result[. China's South Sea
Fleet is more capable of enforcing Chinese territorial claims than the
PLAAF was at enforcing the East China Sea ADIZ. For example, the South
Sea Fleet has two new Type-052D Luyang-III-class destroyers in its
inventory, which pose a major threat to USN surface ships and aircraft.
Moreover, other SCS claimants have less capacity to promote freedom of
navigation compared to the countries that opposed the ADIZ. The
willingness of many neighboring countries to ignore the ADIZ was an
important reason why it failed.]{.underline} In particular, Japan has a
relatively strong and capable military. Southeast Asian nations plan to
expand and improve their navies, but these forces still trail China's
fleet by a significant margin. Full of Sound and Fury, Signifying
Nothing A FONOP also is likely to spark a Chinese backlash, hindering a
peaceful resolution of SCS disputes. As MIT's Taylor Fravel observed, a
[FONOP "gives China an opportunity to assert that the United States is
the country 'militarizing' the South China Sea,"]{.underline} providing
Beijing with an excuse to respond in kind. It would be better to instead
test Chinese pledges of goodwill. Xi Jinping's recent promise not to
militarize the artificial islands may be insincere, but conducting a
FONOP will create pressure for Xi to respond aggressively, even if his
commitment to eschew militarization was genuine. Likewise, China would
appear aggressive, dangerous, and duplicitous if it continued to take
provocative actions after promising to not militarize, making an
American response appear reasonable. Additionally, a FONOP plays into
Chinese nationalist rhetoric that paints American actions as
hypocritical and one-sided. What about America's allies and friends?
Reassuring Washington's partners appears to be the true objective of the
upcoming FONOP[. To make up for their limited military capabilities,
other claimants such as Vietnam and the Philippines have turned to the
United States. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter has repeatedly proclaimed
that American participation in the SCS dispute is intended to reassure
allies that Washington will not leave them flapping in the
wind.]{.underline} For instance, at the Shangri La Dialogue, Carter
declared, "There should be no mistake: the United States will fly, sail,
and operate wherever international law allows." A FONOP in the SCS would
back his rhetoric. However, if China uses the U.S. action as a rationale
for maintaining or increasing the rate of island reclamation then
friendly states likely would feel even more threatened. This would
counteract the FONOP's original purpose and would likely push the United
States and China into a dangerous spiral, requiring more shows of force
to reassure allies against an assertive China acting aggressively in
response to American shows of force[. Chinese behavior in the SCS is a
legitimate concern for the United States, but Washington should realize
that this dispute is unlikely to be resolved with military power.
Indeed, problems will only grow if both Washington and Beijing keep
poking each other in the eye. Maintaining peace in the SCS instead
requires the United States and China to work together to resolve
precisely these kinds of contentious issues.]{.underline}

Manila's sharp turn in regional policy under President Rodrigo Duterte
heightened anticipation among observers that Vietnam would become
Southeast Asia's frontline state in territorial and maritime disputes
with China. **[History has earned Vietnam the reputation of a fierce
fighter, capable of standing up to major powers and winning asymmetric
conflicts.]{.underline}** Unlike the Philippines, Vietnam's communist
system and leadership continuity have given it a largely consistent
strategy toward the South China Sea. Lack of change, however, also
brings disadvantages. **[Vietnam's strategy in the South China Sea is
facing increased limitations in the wake of evolving security
contexts.]{.underline}**

Traditionally, Hanoi's strategy in the South China Sea disputes has
comprised four components:

Internationalizing the disputes

Addressing the disputes within a multilateral framework

Developing a credible military deterrent to China

Engaging directly with China

Internationalizing the Disputes

[Vietnam's purpose in internationalizing the disputes has been to raise
the reputational costs for China when it abuses its power over Vietnam.
In the past, Hanoi generally avoided publicizing the disputes, even
after the maritime battle over Johnson Reef in the Spratlys in
1988]{.underline}. In fact, it is only in the past couple of years that
the government allowed commemorations of the fallen soldiers in that
confrontation. [This strategy began to change in the 2000s, as Vietnam
adopted a policy of internationalization and publicizing incidents at
sea. At the same time, the South China Sea became more prominent due to
a variety of factors, including increased Chinese assertiveness, the
Philippines' legal pursuit of arbitration, and heightened interest from
the United States and other powers.]{.underline}

But even **[successful internationalization has its limits. It assumes
reputational costs will be enough to deter China's coercion. The pattern
of Chinese behavior, however, shows that those costs have been
insufficient. Internationalization's limits were highlighted by the
surprisingly underwhelming effect of the arbitral tribunal ruling in
2016]{.underline}**. A legal victory for the Philippines, which launched
the case against China's claims, quickly turned into a diplomatic
stalemate, not only for Manila but also the other interested parties in
the South China Sea and the international community more broadly, as
Beijing openly rejected the ruling. The shift in the Philippines' policy
under Duterte---who argued that the ruling was best left
untouched---brought international and legal efforts to manage the
disputes to a stand-still. Meanwhile, developments in the South China
Sea have not stood still and China's militarization of its outposts has
continued unabated.

Multilateral Frameworks

Despite the issue's prominence, there seems to be a growing fatigue
toward discussing the South China Sea in international forums. In recent
years, [discussions on the South China Sea in Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) meetings have proven unproductive. At the regional
level, leaders are weary of the topic.]{.underline} International
attention, meanwhile, has been redirected to more imminent crises, such
as North Korean nuclear issues, or the many unexpected developments that
President Donald Trump supplies.

Military Deterrence

Some observers have argued that Vietnamese deterrence posture is
becoming more formidable with the aim of inflicting sufficient damage in
an open confrontation to cause psychological uncertainty in an
adversary. However, **[despite its efforts and growing defense spending,
the reality is that few countries in the world can compete with China,
and Vietnam is not one of them]{.underline}**. [Apart from the sheer
asymmetry of capability, the Vietnamese military has a number of
limitations. It is just beginning to develop maritime capabilities, with
particular focus on surveillance. Detailed analyses of Vietnamese air
and sea power show that they are unlikely to be able to sustain an
extended, large-scale or high-intensity conflict.]{.underline}

In 2014, Lyle Goldstein analyzed Vietnam's defense acquisition and
capability and concluded, "Vietnam's most promising strategy versus
China is the hope that it might have sufficient forces for deterrence,
while simultaneously pursuing diplomacy to resolve disputes." Goldstein
captured it well: Vietnam is no match for China, but it hopes that a
conciliatory approach will compensate for power asymmetry. But hope is
not a strategy. And the Vietnamese, in their capitulation to recent
cases of Chinese coercion, are increasingly proving that.

Engaging Directly

**[Engaging directly with Beijing and relying on Sino-Vietnamese
fraternal solidarity has proven deceptively disappointing for
Hanoi]{.underline}**. In 2014, despite regular exchanges and dialogues
at several levels, including Party-to-Party and between defense
establishments, China took Vietnam by surprise when it sent the Haiyang
Shiyou 981 oil rig into Hanoi's claimed exclusive economic zone. Reports
at the time said the emergency hotline designed for such eventualities
went unanswered by Beijing.

Conclusion

**[Developments have exposed the limits of each component of Hanoi's
strategy toward the South China Sea. They expose Vietnam to
consequential challenges on many levels, including to national
sovereignty, the economy, and diplomatic reputation.]{.underline}**

As Vietnam's battles with China in 1974, 1979, and 1988 show, the
disputes have resulted in infringements of territorial integrity.
China's rapid island-building projects and its militarization of those
features, even after the arbitral tribunal ruling in 2016, mean that
Beijing now has an even greater advantage. In early May 2018, China
placed cruise missiles in the Spratlys, which the Vietnamese government
publicly opposed. Again, Hanoi's protests did not seem to have any
effect. Similarly, China's recent landing of nuclear-capable bombers in
the Paracels shows that it has no intention of lowering the temperature
in the South China Sea.

**[Vietnam's economic prosperity is also at risk. In 2007, the
Vietnamese government set out "Vietnam's Maritime Strategy 2020." It was
a comprehensive strategy including economic, defense, and security
objectives that included transforming Vietnam into a maritime economy.
The plan was to increase the size of the maritime economy, including
trade, fisheries, and oil and gas exploration, by more than half, to 60
percent of GDP by 2020. This plan is being systematically undermined by
China]{.underline}**. The recent cases of Chinese coercion resulting in
Vietnam's cessation of oil and gas exploration---twice involving
cooperation with Spanish company Repsol---prove that this is a
systematic trend which will have a detrimental effect on the Vietnamese
economy.

**[Conceding to Beijing's expansion is also likely to cause Vietnam
reputational damage that might affect the credibility and extent of
diplomatic support that it could gain from outside parties, including
the United States. Vietnam's decision to give in to recent Chinese
pressure to halt oil and gas work, especially coming amid high-profile
security cooperation with the United States that included a historic
U.S. Navy aircraft carrier visit, suggest this is already
happening]{.underline}**. Considering these factors, Hanoi needs to
update its defense strategy in the South China Sea, and quickly.

### SCS -- Yes War

#### SCS escalates -- 3 scenarios (ADIZ causes escalation)

**[Farley 19]{.underline}** Robert Farley is a frequent contributor to
TNI, is a Visiting Professor at the United States Army War College,
6-6-2019, \"Showdown: How a U.S.-China War Could Start in the South
China Sea,\" National Interest,
<https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/showdown-how-us-china-war-could-start-south-china-sea-61182>
Lowell-SB

**[Here are three ways in which tensions in the South China Sea might
lead to conflict.]{.underline}**

Neither China nor the United States want war, at least not in the near
future. China's military buildup notwithstanding, the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) and its components are not ready to fight the
United States. The U.S., for its part, would surely prefer to avoid the
chaos and uncertainty that any military conflict with China would
create.

Nevertheless, [both China and the United States are making commitments
in the South China Sea that each may find difficult to back away from.
Over the past two weeks, these commitments have generated a war of words
that analysts of the relationship have found troubling. The key problems
focus on China's efforts to expand (or create) islands in the Spratlys,
which could theoretically provide the basis for claims to territorial
waters. **The insistence of the United States on freedom of navigation
could bring these tensions to a boil. Here are three ways in which
tensions in the South China Sea might lead to conflict.**]{.underline}

Island Hopping in the SCS

Over the past several months, China has stepped up construction of what
observers are calling "The Great Wall of Sand." This "great wall"
involves expanding a group of islands in the Spratly chain so that they
can support airstrips, weapons, and other permanent installations. It
appears that Beijing is committed to defending these new islands as an
integral parts of Chinese territory, a position that the UN Convention
on the Law of the Sea does not support. Washington has other ideas, and
has maintained that it will carry out freedom-of-navigation patrols in
areas that China claims as territorial waters.

The prospects for conflict are clear. [If U.S. ships or aircraft enter
waters that China claims, then Chinese sailors, soldiers, and pilots
need to take great care about how they respond.]{.underline} A
militarized response could quickly lead to escalation, especially if
American forces suffer any kind of serious damage. [It's also easy to
imagine scenarios in which island-building leads China to become
embroiled against an ASEAN state]{.underline}. In such a case, a
freedom-of-navigation patrol could put China in an awkward position
relative to the third party.

Excitable Fighter Jocks

[China and the United States have already come close to conflict over
aircraft collisions. When a P-3 Orion collided a PLAN J-8 interceptor in
2001, it led to weeks of recriminations and negotiation before the crew
of the P-3 was returned to the United States, and the plane was
returned... in a box.]{.underline}

**[It's easy to imagine an even more serious confrontation in the
SCS]{.underline}**. Another accidental collision would be bad enough,
but if a scenario developed similar to that of the downing of KAL 007,
with a Chinese fighter jock actually opening fire on an American plane,
the situation could get ugly very quickly. And if an American pilot
fired upon a Chinese plane, the reaction of the Chinese public could
become too much for Beijing to reasonably handle.

**[If China decides to go ahead and declare an ADIZ over the South China
Sea, matters could become even more complicated. The United States made
an elaborate display of ignoring China's ADIZ in the East China Sea, but
China has greater interests and a greater presence in the South China
Sea. Another declaration would almost certainly incur a similar reaction
from the United States, putting American and Chinese planes into close
proximity.]{.underline}**

Submarine Misunderstanding

In the Cold War, [the Soviet Union and NATO suffered innumerable
submarine "near misses," as boats hunted each other, and occasionally
bumped each other, in the Atlantic, the Arctic, and the North
Sea]{.underline}. The dynamics of U.S.-Chinese sub interaction hasn't
yet played out in quite the same way, in part because China has yet to
establish a sustained SSBN patrol, and I part because Chinese boats do
not range as far as their Soviet counterparts. But as the submarine
force of the PLAN becomes more adventurous, submarine incidents may
increase.

Many analysts are arguing that the PLAN needs to push its submarines
past the first island chain in order to seriously threaten U.S. access
to China's littoral. Preparing for this would require increasing the
tempo of the PLAN's submarine operations, which would more often put
China's boats in proximity with Japanese and American subs. To be sure,
Chinese submarines are loud enough that U.S. boats should have plenty of
time to get out of their way, but the same could be said of Soviet boats
for much of the Cold War.

If a major submarine incident happened between the United States and
China, the nature of the medium might offer some hope for de-escalation
(we often don't hear about these accidents until much later). But such
an incident would also put more lives and property at stake than a
fighter collision.

Concluding Thoughts

**[Accidental war is rare, but not impossible. Common to all of these
scenarios is the potential that Chinese (or less likely, American)
public opinion might become so inflamed as to box in
policymakers.]{.underline}** If Xi Jinping, who has made assertive
foreign policy a cornerstone of his administration, feels that he cannot
back down and survive politically, then things could get unpredictable
very quickly.

As Denny Roy has argued**[, China is playing offense in the South China
Sea. By establishing facts on the ground (indeed, establishing
"ground"), it is creating a situation in which normal U.S. behavior
looks like destabilizing intervention]{.underline}**. What's less than
clear is that Beijing fully understands the risks of this strategy, or
the dangers of pushing the United States Navy on freedom of navigation,
one of the long-term core interests of the United States. And given that
governments sometimes don't even understand that they're playing a
dangerous game until

### SCS -- UQ / Tensions Rising

#### China is preparing for SCS conflict -- causes a global economic crisis and all-out war

A Chinese Destroyer recently came dangerously close to an American Navy
ship during a "Freedom of Navigation" patrol near a Chinese-occupied
reef in the contested South China Sea. [Over the past several months the
Chinese government has increased aggression toward its neighbors
and]{.underline} US Navy ships patrolling the area. In addition to
increased aggression, [the Chinese government has built several man-made
military bases on top of arcs of shallow reef islands populated by
tropical marine life in the South China Sea]{.underline}. Considering
that the world has over 5 trillion dollars invested in trade flow in the
South China Sea, an increased military escalation could cause the
regional powers to enter into a conflict that could potentially cost
more than they bargain for. [The Philippines, Japan, Vietnam, and South
Korea all rely substantially on trade routes in the South China Sea.
Currently, 5.3 Trillion dollars in total global trade travels through
the region each year along with 11 billion barrels of oil, and 190
trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Increased Chinese aggression puts
more stress on trade routes]{.underline} and ports in China and
throughout Southern Asia. It is projected that 90% of Middle Eastern
fossil fuel exports will to go to Asia by 2035, giving control of vital
shipping routes to China in the contested region. [A military
conflict]{.underline} in the South China Sea [could destabilize current
geopolitical ties and precipitate a world economic crisis that could
lead to an all-out war. China itself relies on the South China sea for
nearly 40% of its total trade.]{.underline} It is possible that this is
why the bases are being constructed, however, [an increase in military
presence in one of the world's major trade routes could imperil future
trade and the stability of the area. Today, China claims 90% of the
South China Sea, much of which is contested by both the Philippines and
Vietnam]{.underline}. Brunei and Malaysia also claim maritime territory
in the South China Sea. These claims have led to the increasing of
defense budgets of all countries involved and escalated the geopolitical
militarization in the region. In a visit to the Southern Theatre
Command, the Chinese [President Xi Jinping ordered maritime troops there
to increase their readiness drills and prepare for war.]{.underline} He
stressed to the commanders China's need to build a force that can "fight
and win wars." This kind of rhetoric could cause a relatively small
incident, such as a Chinese destroyer coming dangerously close to a US
Navy ship, to escalate to an all-out war in the region. Territory in the
South China Sea has been contested for over a century, however, [the
creation of these bases displays a shift in Chinese strategy in the
region.]{.underline} The Paracel, and Spratly Islands, make up two of
the most disputed island chains. The Chinese government claims that its
'infrastructure projects' in the region are strictly for civilian use
only, but its island development has profound security implications.
This hasn't been the first time that the Chinese have transformed these
small shoals; however, China's introduction of military technology to
these miniature ports is a new development. [Earlier in 2018, China
installed anti-ship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missile
systems]{.underline} on three outposts in the South China Sea. [These
missile systems greatly increase China's military capability in the
area, further escalating tensions between regional governments and trade
partners. Runways, support buildings, loading piers, and possible
satellite communication antennas are some of the other infrastructure
projects being constructed in the South China Sea. The creation of these
island bases causes the US and China's neighbors to question what they
are truly being used for.]{.underline} These countries argue that they
drastically increase China's power projection capabilities in the
region. [A greater effort for improved diplomatic ties between China,
the US, and its neighboring countries must be made to ease tensions in
the region]{.underline}. A solution to the South China Sea dispute will
not be found after the swells calm, but rather beforehand at the
negotiation table, where all parties should come together and resolve
the dispute peacefully

MANILA --- [The Philippines]{.underline} on Wednesday [accused a Chinese
vessel of ramming a Philippine boat in the disputed South China Sea,
causing it to sink and putting the lives of the crew at
risk]{.underline}. Although the 22 fishermen onboard were rescued by a
Vietnamese fishing vessel in the area, Philippine officials said the
collision on Sunday had left them "to the mercy of the elements."
["We]{.underline} [condemn in the strongest terms the cowardly action of
the Chinese fishing vessel and its crew for abandoning the Filipino
crew]{.underline}," [Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana
said]{.underline} in a statement. "This is not the expected action from
a responsible and friendly people." Mr. Lorenzana called for a formal
investigation and for diplomatic action "to prevent a repeat of this
incident." The Chinese Embassy in Manila, the Philippine capital, could
not be reached for comment on Wednesday, which was a holiday in the
Philippines commemorating its independence from Spain.President Rodrigo
[Duterte of the Philippines has courted China as a strategic partner
since he was elected]{.underline} in 2016. He was most recently in China
last month, his fourth visit in three years, [but bilateral ties have
been fraying, particularly over territorial disputes. The Philippine
vessel, FB Gimber1, was anchored near Recto Bank in the South China Sea,
a strategically important area that is claimed in whole or in part by
China, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam. Manila

international tribunal]{.underline} in The Hague [ruled in 2016 that it
was in the country's exclusive economic zone]{.underline}. [China has
refused to abide by the ruling, and Mr. Duterte has said there is no way

a meeting of Asia-Pacific defense officials in Singapore this month, Mr.
Lorenzana called on all South China Sea claimants to exercise utmost
caution to prevent an escalation of hostilities. He pushed for freedom
of navigation in the area, while the United States said it was investing
heavily in new technology that would improve its defense capabilities
along with those of its allies. Patrick Shanahan, the acting United
States secretary of defense, also urged Beijing to follow a "rules-based
order" in the region. [Hundreds of protesters marched in Manila on
Wednesday over China's actions in the South China Sea and called on
Filipinos to defend their country's sovereignty. Pamalakaya, a group of
fishermen who joined the protest, demanded that Chinese vessels
immediately withdraw from the disputed area and that Mr. Duterte toughen
his stance against the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping.]{.underline} Bobby
Roldan, [a spokesman for the group, said members could not fish in peace
"courtesy of China's intimidating presence in our waters." "And yet we

warranted.

The [new satellite images show China has built infrastructure covering

year.]{.underline} The Washington-based Asia Maritime Transparency
Initiative ([AMTI]{.underline}) of the Center for Strategic and

storage, missile shelters, radar arrays and other facilities have been
built.]{.underline} The building follows land reclamation by China which
was completed in 2016 in the Spratlys. The island chain is also subject
to territorial claims from Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan, the Philippines
and Brunei. [The US Pentagon says China has added more than 3,200 acres
of land to the seven territories it occupies in the area.]{.underline}

underground facilities on Fiery Cross Reef in the Spratly Islands A
question of use China says the artificial islands in the Spratlys with
their airstrips and military installations are mainly for civilian
purposes and to safeguard fishing and maritime trade. [The AMTI reported
that China has deployed new military aircraft, including J-11B fighter
planes used in drills. In November there were Y-8 transport aircraft
believed to be capable of electronic intelligence gathering. The US has
accused China of militarizing the region and changing its geography to
strengthen its claims across the South China Sea. Washington believes
China will use the islands and its military presence on them to deny
access to strategic routes]{.underline}. In the Paracel islands, a new
helipad, wind turbines and large radar towers had been built. The radar
towers on Triton Island could be used in China\'s disputes with Vietnam
and with the US over freedom of navigation operations, which the US navy
has used to back its perceived right to free passage in international
waters. [China\'s engineering feats in the region have raised concerns
from its neighbors, especially the Philippines]{.underline} which
brought a case to the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague which
ruled in July 2016 against China. But Beijing refused to acknowledge
either the decision or the court\'s jurisdiction. After the election of
President Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, the new government adopted
a more conciliatory attitude towards China. The US has also moved its
focus away from China\'s activities in the South China Sea to North
Korea and its nuclear programs. [Greg Poling, the AMTI director said:
\"It\'s gotten off the front pages, but we shouldn\'t confuse that with
a softening in China\'s pursuit of its goals. They are continuing all
the construction they want.\".]{.underline}

#### Tensions now in SCS over freedom of navigation

12-13-2018, \"How U.S.-China tensions could get a lot worse,\" POLITICO

Lowell-SB

**[Rising tensions over Beijing's accelerating military buildup in the
South China Sea are stoking fears of a major-power clash between China
and the United States --- fueling urgent calls for new security talks
before the two nations stumble into a shooting war.]{.underline}**

[But the worries come amid a dearth of official dialogue between two of
the world\'s largest militaries, and as U.S. leaders espouse an
increasingly harder line against China's actions]{.underline}. The U.S.
and its allies have stepped up naval and air patrols over the sea and
canceled joint exercises with Beijing, while China is considering
requiring all aircraft flying over the area to first identify themselves
--- a step that many nations would consider threatening.

Military experts say the showdown could easily spin out of control.

"Chinese colleagues have said to me explicitly that if the U.S.
continues to sail through and over-fly what they see as their waters,
China will eventually shoot down the offending aircraft,\" said Matthew
Kroenig, a former CIA analyst and Pentagon strategist. ["Maybe that's
just a bluff, but if China shot down a U.S. plane, that would be a
scenario ripe for escalation. It's hard to see President \[Donald\]
Trump or any other U.S. leader backing down from that."]{.underline}

U.S. military leaders insist they're determined to avoid that. Navy Adm.
Phil Davidson, the U.S. commander of the Indo-Pacific Command, told
POLITICO he's eager to open a new dialogue with his Chinese
counterparts, contending that "a military-to-military relationship is
quite important.\"

\"I have yet to meet the \[chief of defense\] or the minister of defense
in China,\" he said. \"I hope to visit early next year."

Marine Gen. Joe Dunford, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff,
says establishing more channels for the militaries to avoid conflict is
one his top priorities as Washington and Beijing also tussle over issues
such as trade and North Korea\'s nuclear program. "Competition does not
necessarily lead to conflict," he said at a recent security forum in
Canada.

On the other hand, the U.S. is trying to send Chinese leaders a pointed
message by sending an increased number of military patrols through the
disputed waters, Dunford said in an interview with POLITICO.

**[\"What we are doing is preserving the principle of open access to the
global commons," Dunford said. And he said nations "violating
international norms, standards and the law" should know they are "going
to pay a cost that is higher than whatever they hope to
gain."]{.underline}**

Similarly, Beijing's leaders are not backing down from their military
expansion in the vast South China Sea, which stretches more than 1.3
million square miles with trillions of dollars worth of trade transiting
annually. Those waters include the Spratly Islands chain where China
seized reefs and began building artificial islands during the second
term of the Obama administration.

Despite public assurances from President Xi Jinping that the features
would not be militarized, China recently deployed surface-to-air
missiles and other weapons and equipment. Earlier this year, satellite
images showed that Beijing has built at least four airstrips suitable
for military aircraft on Woody Island, as well as the reefs in the
archipelago known as Fiery Cross, Mischief and Subi.

[China has telegraphed steps to further solidify its claims in the
waters. In June, Chinese Lt. Gen. He Lei acknowledged during the
Shangri-La defense summit in Singapore that China is deploying troops
and weapons on both natural and man-made islands in the Paracel and
Spratly archipelagos.]{.underline}

Chinese military sources who were not authorized to speak publicly said
the People's Liberation Army's Air Force and Strategic Support Force
have also placed sophisticated radar systems in the South China Sea.

\"Since the U.S. has kept sending spy aircraft to do the close-in
reconnaissance activities near China\'s territory waters in the South
China Sea, it\'s necessary to deploy sophisticated radar system to the
artificial islands to detect the U.S. aircraft,\" one of the sources
from the firm said.

**[He Lei, who led Chinese military delegation to the Shangri-La
Dialogue, said that \"deploying troops and weapons on islands in the
South China Sea is within China's sovereign right to do and allowed by
international law."]{.underline}**

[The U.S. and other countries have condemned the expansion as a
violation of international law. And in recent months, top American
military officials have dropped some of their usual diplomatic
language.]{.underline}

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis revoked China's invitation to
participate in an annual military exercise this fall, then canceled a
trip to Beijing planned for October.

"If you\'d asked me two months ago, I\'d have said we are still
attempting to maintain a cooperative stance," the retired four-star
general said at the Shangri-La summit. "But then you look at what
President Xi said in the Rose Garden of the White House in 2015, that
they would not militarize the Spratlys, and then we watched what
happened four weeks ago, it was time to say there\'s a consequence to
this."

During his trip to Vietnam in October, Mattis said Washington was highly
concerned about China\'s \"predatory\" behavior and militarization of
the South China Sea.

"We remain highly concerned with the continued militarization of
features in the South China Sea," he said, saying that this continued to
happen despite a pledge by Xi not to do so.

Davidson, the top American commander in the Asia-Pacific, expressed
alarm recently at China's "secretly deployed anti-ship missiles,
electronic jammers and surface-to-air missiles."

"So what was a great wall of sand just three years ago," Davidson added,
"is now a great wall of SAMs in the South China Sea, giving the
\[People's Republic of China\] the potential to exert national control
over international waters in the South China Sea."

**[The U.S. and its allies have also launched \"freedom of navigation\"
operations in the region. In September, two pairs of U.S. Air Force B-52
bombers flew over the disputed area --- one pair over the South China
Sea and one over the East China Sea. A week later, the destroyer USS
Decatur came within 12 nautical miles of two of the disputed reefs,
prompting maneuvers by a Chinese destroyer that the Pentagon called
"unsafe" and "unprofessional."]{.underline}**

Australia, Japan, France, Canada and New Zealand are among the allies
taking part in the patrols.

"What we are doing is preserving the principle of open access to the
global commons," said Dunford, the U.S. Joint Chiefs chairman, in an
interview with POLITICO. He said the United States' message is that
nations "violating international norms, standards and the law" are
"going to pay a cost that is higher than whatever they hope to gain."

But the growing prominence of those other military forces has caused
China to "push back more, and that heightens the risk that you could
have an inadvertent crisis," said Lindsey Ford of the Asia Society, who
is also a former senior adviser to the U.S. assistant secretary of
Defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs.

China's interest is not simply to exert political or economic influence
in the region, said Kroenig, the former CIA analyst. Its activities are
also defensive in nature, he believes.

China, like the Soviet Union during the Cold War, is not confident that
its nuclear ballistic missile submarines could survive in the open ocean
during a conflict with the United States, he said --- because waters
closer to Chinese territory are too shallow. So it hopes to use the
South China Sea as an operating area for its subs.

"That's a strategic military purpose on top of the political purpose,"
said Kroenig. "I've had a Chinese colleague say to me: 'You guys don't
really care about these territorial claims in the South China Sea.
You're trying to deny our nuclear deterrent.\'\"

Now, Chinese military experts say, Beijing is considering establishing
an \"air defense identification zone,\" which would require all aircraft
over the area to declare their identity and destination.

The rationale is ostensibly peaceful in nature: Chinese officials
maintain it would help prevent disasters such as the 2014 disappearance
of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.

But a zone Beijing established in the East China Sea in 2013 drew a
joint rebuke from Japan and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations,
which considered it threatening.

The pushback from other nations \"implied that such a move constituted a
security challenge," said Collin Koh Swee Lean, an analyst at the S.
Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.

Koh warned that the air traffic proposal could derail regional talks
about establishing a code of conduct to avoid confrontations in the
area. He also predicted that the U.S. might feel compelled to ramp up
its military presence in response --- a view echoed by Zhou Chenming, a
military expert based in Beijing.

**[Further fueling tensions in the South China Sea is the growing role
of China\'s so-called Maritime Militia, a naval paramilitary force that
operates disguised as fishing or other civilian vessels. Vice President
Mike Pence recently criticized the forces as extralegal, and the rules
for approaching them are ill-defined.]{.underline}**

\"Should we treat them as military vessels and expect them to behave
that way?\" asked the Asia Society's Ford. \"China is exploiting a
loophole. Pence's recent remarks calling out the Maritime Militia
explicitly suggest the U.S. is refining its thinking about how to
approach that loophole."

[For now, senior American military leaders are expressing confidence
that U.S. forces can continue to aggressively promote their
freedom-of-navigation mission without sparking a violent
confrontation.]{.underline}

["I think one of the unfortunate things is the focus on two destroyers
passing in the daylight," Davidson told POLITICO. "That is not what the
issue is about in the South China Sea. It is about trade, commerce,
financial markets moving their information around the globe --- every
airline that flies over the top.\"]{.underline}

with the United States. Under President Xi Jinping, China has increased
its political and economic pressure on Taiwan and **built military
installations on coral reefs in the South China Sea, fueling
Washington's fears that Chinese expansionism will threaten U.S. allies
and influence in the region**.]{.underline} U.S. destroyers have
transited the Taiwan Strait, to loud protests from Beijing. American
policymakers have wondered aloud whether they should send an aircraft
carrier through the strait as well. Chinese fighter jets have
intercepted U.S. aircraft in the skies above the South China Sea.
Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has brought long-simmering
economic disputes to a rolling boil.

**[A war between the two countries remains unlikely, but the prospect of
a military confrontation---resulting, for example, from a Chinese
campaign against Taiwan---no longer seems as implausible as it once did.
And the odds of such a confrontation going nuclear are higher than most
policymakers and analysts think.]{.underline}**

Members of China's strategic com­munity tend to dismiss such concerns.
Likewise, [U.S. studies of a potential war with China often exclude
nuclear weapons from the analysis entirely, treating them as basically
irrelevant to the course of a conflict]{.underline}. Asked about the
issue in 2015, Dennis Blair, the former commander of U.S. forces in the
Indo-Pacific, estimated the likelihood of a U.S.-Chinese nuclear crisis
as "somewhere between nil and zero."

**[This assurance is misguided. If deployed against China, the
Pentagon's preferred style of conventional warfare would be a potential
recipe for nuclear escalation. Since the end of the Cold War, the United
States' signature approach to war has been simple: punch deep into enemy
territory in order to rapidly knock out the opponent's key military
assets at minimal cost]{.underline}**. But the Pentagon developed this
formula in wars against Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Serbia, none of
which was a nuclear power.

#### US-China war over SCS goes nuclear

U.S.-China nuclear war is greater than most people realize, a security
expert has warned,\" Newsweek,

[It is more likely than in the past that China and the U.S. could enter
into a military conflict, and the possibility of such a battle going
nuclear is higher than many analysts believe, a security expert from
Georgetown University has warned.]{.underline}

Caitlin Talmadge, who is an associate professor of security studies at
the Walsh School of Foreign Service, laid out a grim picture of how
military escalation could play out between Washington and Beijing in an
article for Foreign Affairs\' November-December issue.

**[\"The odds of such a confrontation going nuclear are higher than most
policymakers and analysts think,\" she wrote. However, she also pointed
out that \"a war between the two countries remains unlikely, but\...no
longer seems as implausible as it once did.\"]{.underline}**

According to Talmadge, most U.S. and Chinese analysts have generally
dismissed the possibility of a nuclear confrontation altogether.
However, looking at the Pentagon\'s preferred war tactics in recent
conflicts, the professor pointed out that typical U.S. strategy involves
punching \"deep into enemy territory in order to rapidly knock out the
opponent\'s key military assets at minimal cost.\"

\"The Pentagon developed this formula in wars against Afghanistan, Iraq,
Libya, and Serbia, none of which was a nuclear power,\" Talmadge wrote.

**[In China, nuclear and other more conventional military weapons are
closely intertwined, meaning the U.S. would likely purposefully or
inadvertently target Beijing\'s nuclear capabilities early on.
Recognizing this possibility, the Chinese may consider using their
nuclear arsenal before it could be taken out.]{.underline}**

Talmadge suggested that such a scenario could arise if Beijing were to
move to invade Taiwan. A conflict could also erupt over territorial
rights in the South China Sea, where Beijing has staked claim to what
much of the world sees as international waters. Tensions have remained
high between U.S. and Chinese naval patrols within the region.

Although Talmadge maintains that such military scenarios are not highly
likely, **[the risk has increased as tensions between China and the U.S.
have escalated. \"This sobering reality should encourage leaders on both
sides to find ways of resolving political, economic and military
disputes without resorting to a war that could rapidly turn catastrophic
for the region and the world,\" she concluded her
article.]{.underline}**

The warning comes as the Trump administration has raised concern about
the growing threat from China, arguing that it is working to interfere
in U.S. elections. While many security and intelligence experts have
pointed to Beijing\'s ambitions for greater dominance, analysts have
also cautioned that little evidence exists that the Chinese are working
to interfere directly in U.S. polls.

MANILA (Reuters) [- A maritime code of conduct between Southeast Asia
and China must be legally binding to put a **stop to "unilateral
actions" in the South China Sea**]{.underline}, because a [previous
commitment to play fair had been ignored]{.underline}, the ASEAN
secretary general said on Friday. The [Association of South East Asian
Nations had **not received any guarantees from China** in discussions to
create a framework for the code within this year]{.underline}, but ASEAN
was hopeful a set of rules could be agreed to [ward off disputes and
militarization]{.underline}, Le Luong Minh told Reuters. "For ASEAN,
such a framework must have substantial elements, and such a code of
conduct must be legally binding," he said in an interview. [Signing
China up to a code that it must abide by, and can be enforced, has long
been a goal for ASEAN's claimant members: Vietnam, the Philippines,
Brunei and Malaysia. China claims sovereignty over almost the entire
South China Sea]{.underline}. China's recent decision to work with ASEAN
to draw up a framework for a code, 15 years after they agreed to one,
has been met with a mix of optimism and scepticism, coming at a time
when **[Beijing races ahead with development of its seven artificial
islands in the Spratlys]{.underline}**. It has put [radar, runways,
hangars and missiles]{.underline} on some of those features, [causing
alarm]{.underline} in the region and concern [about its long-term
intentions]{.underline}. The framework, which all sides hope to finish
this year, seeks to advance a 2002 Declaration of Conduct (DOC) of
Parties in the South China Sea, which [commits to following
international law, ensuring freedom of navigation]{.underline} and not
putting people on uninhabited islands and features.

MILITARIZATION ACTIVITIES

"It's important \... because of the complex developments in the South
China Sea, especially the reclamation and militarization activities and
all those unilateral actions," Minh said of the code. "In that context,
the need for an instrument which is legally binding, which is capable of
not only preventing but also managing such incidents, is very
important." **[Making demands of China is something ASEAN states have
long been reluctant to do, wary of their economic dependence on their
giant neighbor]{.underline}**. ASEAN leaders are meeting in Manila for a
summit this week. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said on Thursday
it was pointless discussing Beijing's contentious activities and no one
dared to pressure it anyway. [Experts **doubt China would tie itself to
a set of rules in a waterway central to its geostrategic
ambitions**]{.underline} and expect it to drag the process out until
ASEAN accepts a weaker code than it wants. Asked if China had made any
assurances it would stick to whatever code was agreed, Minh said: "We
don't have any guarantee, we just have to try our best." Minh said the
code needed to be more comprehensive than the 2002 DOC, which was only a
political declaration. "It was good if all parties were implementing
what was agreed, but that's not what is happening. The COC (code of
conduct), we need a legally binding instrument." Minh also urged
[de-escalation of tensions on the Korean peninsula, and said North
Korea's foreign minister had sent a letter to him two weeks ago asking
for ASEAN's support]{.underline}. He did not say what Pyongyang had
asked ASEAN to do. "They expressed concern over what they (perceive) to
be the threat to their security," he said. "They especially mentioned
the joint exercises between the U.S. and South Korea."

DGP)

According to Reuters, ASEAN officials say that they will meet with
Chinese representatives in Singapore beginning March 18 to try and make
some progress on talks to establish a "code of conduct" in the South
China Sea. China agreed to discuss a South China Sea code of conduct at
the ASEAN forum last July, a move that was widely applauded in the
region. The first round of meetings was [held in Beijing in
September](https://thediplomat.com/2013/09/a-code-of-conduct-for-the-south-china-sea/),
and concluded with an agreement to seek "gradual progress and consensus
through consultations."

Unfortunately, when it comes to [ASEAN, China, and the South China Sea,
progress has been slow and consensus almost nonexistent]{.underline}. 
Negotiations over a code of conduct are complicated by the simple fact
that not every ASEAN member state is involved in the territorial
disputes. [Of the 10 ASEAN members, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia,
and Brunei claim territory that also falls within China's "nine-dash
line." Even these four states are not on the same page, with Vietnam and
the Philippines vocally **protesting China's 'aggression'** and Malaysia
and Brunei keeping a much lower profile]{.underline}.

Of the remaining ASEAN states, Indonesia often positions itself as a
mediator, sometimes joined by Singapore. The others (Cambodia, Laos,
Myanmar, and Thailand) have little interest in becoming embroiled in
disputes between China and their neighbors --- especially as China
accounts for [over 12
percent](http://www.asean.org/images/resources/2014/Jan/StatisticUpdate28Jan/table19_as20Dec13.pdf)
of all ASEAN trade. China is an especially lucrative partner [for
Cambodia](https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/10/us-cambodia-china-idUSBRE93909D20130410),
which received a promise of nearly \$550 million in aid last year, and
[for
Myanmar](http://www.ibtimes.com/myanmar-fdi-china-accounts-one-third-foreign-investment-myanmar-14-billion-1446282),
where China accounts for one-third of all foreign direct investment.
Actually, China and ASEAN already have one agreement on the South China
Sea --- the 2002 "[Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South
China
Sea](http://www.asean.org/asean/external-relations/china/item/declaration-on-the-conduct-of-parties-in-the-south-china-sea)."
That document expressed a desire to "enhance favorable conditions for a
peaceful and durable solution of differences and disputes among
countries concerned." In the 2002 declaration, ASEAN and China
reaffirmed a commitment to international law (including the UN
Convention on the Law of the Sea) and to the freedom of navigation in
the South China Sea. All parties also agreed to "resolve their
territorial and jurisdictional disputes by peaceful means, without
resorting to the threat or use of force." Further, the parties agreed to
"exercise self-restraint" in taking actions that could "complicate or
escalate disputes."

Finally, in the declaration ASEAN and China agreed that adopting an
official "code of conduct" would "further promote peace and stability."
[Yet since 2002, there's been little progress made towards actually
taking that next step. In fact, disagreements over how to handle
proposals for a code of conduct helped derail the [2012 ASEAN
ministerial
meeting](http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/NG27Ae03.html) held
in Cambodia. **The U.S. had reportedly pushed hard for progress on a
code of conduct, with backing from Vietnam and the
Philippines**]{.underline}. Other ASEAN states, notably host nation
Cambodia, refused to back the proposal. The meeting dissolved without
even the customary diplomatic communiqué.

Many look to Indonesia, seen as ASEAN's honorary leader, to bridge the
gap between the various member states. Indonesia has in fact been taking
its role as mediator quite seriously. In the aftermath of the failed
2012 ASEAN ministerial meeting, Indonesian Foreign Minister [Marty
Natalegawa
visited](https://thediplomat.com/2012/07/aseans-soul-searching-after-phnom-penh/) the
Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, and Singapore. His shuttle
diplomacy resulted in the "[Six-Point
Principles ](http://asc.iseas.edu.sg/images/stories/pdf/Statement_of_ASEAN_Foreign_Ministers_on_ASEANs_Six_Point_Principles.pdf)"
being issued on July 20, snatching a diplomatic victory from the ashes
of the ASEAN meeting.

Indonesia is also responsible for a reported draft version of a possible
"code of conduct." According to Reuters, which has seen the draft, the
preliminary text from Indonesia would call for an **[end to military
exercises in disputed waters and reaffirm total freedom of navigation in
the region]{.underline}**. The draft also reportedly set out rules to
prevent accidents at sea.

[China has resisted coming into to negotiations]{.underline} with a
sample draft, and from Indonesia's proposal it's not hard to see why.
[**China's** navy routinely conducts **exercises in disputed regions,
and the [Chinese Coast
Guard](https://thediplomat.com/2013/08/the-promise-and-peril-of-chinas-new-coast-guard/) also
patrols the water as a way of asserting Chinese control**. If a code of
conduct would outlaw such activities, it's hard to imagine why China
would sign on to it.]{.underline}

China, meanwhile, has its own requirements for a code of conduct,
as [articulated last
year](http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/zxxx/t1064869.shtml) by Foreign
Minister Wang Yi. Wang insisted on "consensus through negotiations,"
saying that the negotiations should "keep the comfort of all parties in
mind." From the Chinese perspective, this means that countries with
friendly relations with Beijing should not be pressured to support a
hardline code of conduct. [It's unlikely that Beijing is overly
concerned with Vietnam and the Philippines' "comfort" being infringed on
by an overly lax code of conduct.]{.underline}

Wang also called for an "elimination of interference," saying that the
reason ASEAN and China have made no progress on a code of conduct is due
to outside meddling. Wang is referring to U.S. efforts to encourage a
code of conduct --- China has repeatedly denounced U.S. involvement in
ASEAN meetings as interference in what then-Minister of Defense Liang
Guanglie has called [the "distinctively
Asian"](http://www.iiss.org/en/events/shangri%20la%20dialogue/archive/shangri-la-dialogue-2011-4eac/fourth-plenary-session-b880/liang-guanglie-e6a2) regional
architecture. "Only Asians should lead the process to resolve regional
issues," [argued China
Daily](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2010-10/30/content_11479025.htm) after
the U.S. raised the South China Sea as an issue at the 2010 ASEAN
summit. In other words, **[China wants the U.S. excluded from regional
conversations, and will not move forward on a code of conduct until the
U.S. butts out.]{.underline}**

Consensus will be difficult to forge, but no ASEAN member state would
recommend moving forward on a code of conduct without it. Meanwhile,
Wang's other main condition is unlikely to be met. Since the [U.S. has
repeatedly stated it has an interest in the peaceful resolution of the
South China Sea disputes]{.underline}, such 'interference' is unlikely
to go away anytime soon. The U.S. will continue to voice its support for
a code of conduct, which China will interpret as unwanted interference.
U.S. involvement in the process allows some in China to deny that ASEAN
itself is interested in a code of conduct, and which provides an excuse
for Beijing to drag its feet on the process.

[Ultimately **Beijing has the most to lose from a code of conduct**.
Such an agreement would limit its activities in waters that China claims
and de facto controls (such as the Paracel Islands and, increasingly,
the Scarborough Shoal), while also hampering China's strategy to
increase its area of de facto control through maritime patrols.
Countries don't generally give up national advantages (perceived or
real) in exchange for the stability provided by international
law]{.underline} --- [the U.S., for example, still has not acceded to
UNCLOS.](https://thediplomat.com/2012/03/u-s-must-remove-unclos-handcuffs/)

China is unlikely to prove an exception. [It loses little and gains much
by stalling the code of conduct talks]{.underline}--- or at least making
sure the final version is so watered down as to be essentially
meaningless.

#### The US Needs to stop Chinese Salami Slicing -- Protect US hegemony, International law, and US East Asian Allies

DGP)

There was a time, when President Barack Obama was still in the White
House, when the U.S.-led coalition in the Asia-Pacific could have
responded to, and perhaps countered, the [creeping occupation and
militarization of the South China Sea. According to many security
experts]{.underline}, the window for such action has now closed, and
Beijing has successfully created irreversible facts on the ground. If
that is indeed the case, then freedom of navigation operations (FONOPS)
and other measures are too little, too late. China has engineered a new
status quo in the South China Sea, and efforts to counter its larger
ambitions should henceforth focus elsewhere.

What is perhaps most surprising about what has occurred in the South
China Sea in the past decade isn't so much that China has succeeded in
building a series of artificial islands and militarizing what it regards
as its "lake," but rather that the international community would be
caught unawares by the current state of affairs. From the outset,
Beijing telegraphed its intentions in the South China Sea, and if it has
become a no-go zone for others in the region, and for the United States,
it is largely the result of our inattention and our failure to read the
tea leaves.

Democratic states in the region, along with their longstanding security
guarantor back in Washington, now face a new dilemma. And this time it
should be clear to all that inaction or inattention will only mean more
trouble down the line. Aware that China's activities in the South China
Sea are directly related to its larger ambitions in the West Pacific and
Indo-Pacific (among them displacing the United States), it is now
incumbent upon allied states in the region to give serious thought to
whether even more Chinese expansionism is something they can live with.

The first area where this question needs to be asked is in the East
China Sea, where [China has also increased its military and maritime
militia activities]{.underline}---primarily near the disputed
Diaoyu/Senkaku islets claimed by Tokyo, Beijing and Taipei. **[There, as
in the South China Sea, Beijing's strategy has been one of "salami
slicing"---small, gradual gains that, over time, fundamentally shift the
balance in Beijing's favor]{.underline}**. [As I argued in an [earlier
piece](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/chinas-permanent-conflict-strategy-stroke-genius-17293) for
the National Interest, Beijing has created an environment of "permanent
conflict" in the East and South China Sea whereby it alternating
escalation between the two areas, shifting out when its actions drew too
much attention, only to return months later to build upon previous
gains.]{.underline}

For various reasons, the might of the Japanese self-defense forces and
Tokyo's security treaty with the United States chief among them, China's
gains in the East China Sea have been more limited than in the South
China Sea. Still, the frequency of intrusions by Coast Guard and fishing
vessels into Japanese territorial waters or near the disputed
Senkaku/Diaoyu islets, and of transits by the People's Liberation Army
Navy (PLAN) and PLA Air Force (PLAAF) through the Strait of Miyako,
between Taiwan and Japan, into the West Pacific, has reached alarming
levels in recent years.

If, as I would argue, there is no going back in the South China Sea and
we must resign ourselves to ceding that maritime territory to China,
then the next step is to decide what to do next. **[More inaction would
likely embolden Beijing to seek to accomplish in the East China Sea what
it has already achieved in the South China Sea]{.underline}**. Another
option, if the fledgling democratic alliance is ready to take concrete
countervailing action against China, would be to turn the entire East
China Sea into a "choke point" for China: denied area whereby the PLAN
and PLAAF would no longer be able to use the nine existing channels it
currently uses to transit from within the first island chain into the
West Pacific. [Between them, Japan, the United States and Taiwan
undoubtedly have the means to close off this area to the Chinese
military by fielding various naval, ground-based and airborne defense
systems as well as by reinforcing Yonaguni Island]{.underline}, which
lies just 108 kilometers (67 miles) from the east coast of Taiwan. (I
would also argue that every effort should be made to ensure
that [Palau](https://sentinel.tw/china-bans-tour-vatican-palau/), a tiny
speck in the Pacific but strategically located, retains its official
diplomatic ties with Taiwan.)

Without doubt, such a move would be escalatory. Nevertheless, the case
could be made that **[China has already flouted international law by
refusing to recognize the legitimacy of the July 2016 Permanent Court of
Arbitration [ruling](https://pca-cpa.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/175/2016/07/PH-CN-20160712-Award.pdf) against
it]{.underline}**, not to mention the unprecedented occupation and
militarization of an expanse of international waters. Such actions could
legitimize a counteractive move by an Asian alliance which would in
effect punish Beijing for its failure to behave as a responsible
stakeholder. The objective of such enforcement action, which no doubt
would necessitate coordination between Japan, Taiwan and the United
States., and possibly with other allies, would be to deny China the East
China Sea as a transit corridor into the West Pacific and limit it to
the Bashi Channel between Taiwan and the Philippines. In other words, it
would yield to China's gains, but prevent further ones, especially as
gains in the East China Sea would pose a direct threat to Japanese trade
routes, the U.S. military presence in the Pacific and expose the
continental United States to missile attack by Chinese submarines.

With its many successes in the South China Sea, Beijing has effectively
created a "choke point" for its competitors; in the complex game of go
that has emerged in the Indo-Pacific, the democratic alliance's next
move should be to create a "choke point" of its own. Otherwise, there is
no reason why China, having consolidated its successes in the South
China Sea, should not try to repeat this feat further north.

Moreover, for Japan, such a strategy would imply strengthening its
security relationship with Taiwan while adding urgency to the
maintenance of the "status quo" in the Taiwan Strait. The continued
existence of Taiwan as a sovereign entity is a key component of this
strategy; annexation by China would neutralize what is arguably the
single most important barrier to Beijing's goals in the West and
Indo-Pacific.

Without concrete action, rhetoric about "pivots" and "rebalancing" will
remain empty slogans. There are risks in escalation, but at the same
time continued inaction, or even more of the ad hoc same, is a recipe
for the creation of a future that very well could be untenable to the
alliance a few years hence.

The urgency of taking countervailing action has also become more evident
following the recent announcement by Beijing in early July that control
of China's Coast Guard has been [shifted from civilian
command](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-Relations/China-puts-coast-guard-under-military-command) to
direct control by the Central Military Commission (CMC), which is
supervised by President Xi Jinping. Most experts are of the opinion that
this move occurred by design rather than as the result of concessions to
hawkish elements by an embattled Xi. Whatever the reason, we can now
expect the Coast Guard to act as proxy to the PLAN, a fact that creates
a variety of uncertainties as to rules of engagement and which
undoubtedly is intended to test the alliance's resolve. Here again,
absence of an appropriate response to this "salami slicing" strategy
would create new facts at sea and could, furthermore, prove
destabilizing to the entire legal system should other countries decide
to emulate Beijing and militarize their own civilian maritime agencies.
If indeed putting the Coast Guard under CMC command was by design, then
we can expect the Coast Guard to become more assertive in "defending"
China's territorial claims in both the East and South China Sea, often
with Coast Guard vessels that are better equipped and have a larger
displacement than their competitors.

[The impact of China's growing ambitions within and beyond the first
island chain, and by default over the East and South China Seas, affect
not only the ability of the U.S. military to retain its role in the Asia
Pacific, but increasingly undermine Taiwan's---and Japan's---sense of
security]{.underline}. At some point, the alliance of democracies will
need to make a choice between greater accommodation of Chinese
expansionism and strategic retaliation. Having already "lost" the South
China Sea, it is incumbent upon the alliance to enter the game and to
demonstrate that it, too, means business. To do so, it will have to be
willing to escalate, well beyond the occasional FONOPS and annual U.S.
Navy transits in the Taiwan Strait. The East China Sea is undoubtedly
the place to start, given that it is of immediate concern to all three
key partners in Northeast Asia---Japan, Taiwan and the United
States---and that it constitutes the last remaining "choke point" within
the first island chain. [Until China can demonstrate its willingness to
abide by international law and to respect the territorial integrity of
other regional powers, the East China Sea corridor should be denied it
as a transit point into the West Pacific.]{.underline}

initiatives aimed at reasserting America's commitment to the 'Free and
Open Indo-Pacific' (FOIP), a new geopolitical paradigm that aims to
undercut China's growing influence in the region.]{.underline}**

[Chinese Foreign Minister and State Councilor Wang Yi, meanwhile,
promoted China's trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), with
Southeast Asia as a key target market]{.underline}. Crucially, the
Chinese chief diplomat celebrated a new 'milestone' in ongoing
negotiations over a Code of Conduct (COC) in the South China Sea, which
could serve as a mechanism to exclude America from the region.

[As Sino-American competition in Southeast Asia heats up, smaller powers
are increasingly worried about the prospect of an all-out conflict that
could end decades of stability and prosperity.]{.underline} Instead,
they prefer a healthy rivalry, which provides Southeast Asian states
alternative sources of investments, defense assistance, and, above all,
greater strategic space.

An Ascendant China

[During the recently concluded ASEAN Foreign Ministers Meeting (AFMM) in
Singapore, China and Southeast Asian countries triumphantly announced
the completion of a \"Single Draft COC Negotiating Text.\"]{.underline}
The draft will serve as the basis for negotiation of a final document,
which will operationalize the basic rules of engagement among competing
claimant states in the South China Sea -- namely China, the Philippines,
Brunei, Vietnam, and Malaysia.

Taiwan, which China treats as a renegade province, is not officially
part of the negotiations, but it's expected to abide by any final
document, since it occupies the biggest naturally formed island in the
area (Itu Aba). The COC negotiations have been going on for almost two
decades, but China and the ASEAN contend that they are finally seeing
the light at the end of the long tunnel.

As the outgoing ASEAN-China Coordinator, Singapore's Foreign Affairs
Minister Vivian Balakrishnan triumphantly described the draft as the
"living document and the basis of future code of conduct negotiations."
In their joint statement, Southeast Asian ministers were pleased with
the outcome of the negotiations and the direction of bilateral relations
with China. The ASEAN foreign ministers "warmly welcomed the continued
improving cooperation" with Beijing, celebrating the recent strides in
negotiating a "substantive" COC and expanding their cooperation in the
realm of maritime security.

Just days later, Chinese and ASEAN navies held their first-ever joint
naval exercises in Singapore's Changi Naval Base. The highly symbolic
event saw both sides enhancing their mutual confidence and
inter-operability vis-à-vis threats such as terrorism and piracy. Both
sides are looking at institutionalized Confidence-Building Measures
(CBMs) such as regular joint naval exercises as well as joint oil and
gas exploration activities in the South China Sea.

What's crucial, however, is that China wants not just to improve
relations with ASEAN, but to do it at the expense of the U.S.

[According to the most recent draft of the COC, China, under the section
Duty to Cooperate, encouraged "military activities in the region," which
"shall be conducive to enhancing mutual trust." They have proposed
"mutual port calls of military vessels and joint patrols on a regular
basis" as well as "undertaking joint military exercises among China and
ASEAN Member States on a regular basis."]{.underline}

Yet, China also proposed for all parties to the agreement to: "establish
a notification mechanism on military activities, and to notify each
other of major military activities if deemed necessary. The Parties
shall not hold joint military exercises with countries from outside the
region \[author's emphasis\], unless the parties concerned are notified
beforehand and express no objection."

As Australian analyst Carl Thayer, who obtained the copy of the COC
draft, accurately observes, **[China "aims to bind ASEAN members states
in the COC and limit if not exclude the involvement of third parties."
Confident with its growing influence in Southeast Asia, China is
brazenly calling on the ASEAN countries to push the U.S. out of the
South China Sea.]{.underline}** This is a particularly controversial
position, since multiple ASEAN countries either have treaty alliances
(Thailand and the Philippines) or close strategic partnerships
(Singapore and Vietnam) with the U.S. Navy. In fact, even historically
'non-aligned' countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia have stepped up
their defense cooperation with the U.S. in recent years.

The American Pushback

[It's not clear whether the ASEAN countries will accede to China's
demand, but Beijing is openly confident about cajoling Southeast Asian
countries into its sphere of influence. Without the U.S. military
presence, China will be in a fully ascendant military position vis-à-vis
its smaller neighbors.]{.underline}

[Aware of Beijing's exclusionary strategy, Washington and its allies
have struck back. During the Australia-U.S. Ministerial Consultations
(AUSMIN) in Stanford, California, in late-July, U.S. Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense James Mattis underscored China's
growing threat to regional security.]{.underline}

In their joint statement, the American and Australian defense and
foreign ministers, "emphasized that militarization of disputed features
in the South China Sea is contrary to the region's desire for peaceful
development." They called for a COC, which is "consistent with existing
international law," while calling on China -- albeit indirectly -- to
"cease actions that complicate disputes and not to prejudice the
interests of third parties or the rights of all states under
international law."

During his visit to the ASEAN, Pompeo unveiled two initiatives, namely a
\$113 million investment fund to mobilize private American capital for
high technology and high-quality investments in the ASEAN, and a \$300
million package of security assistance to enhance the maritime security
capabilities of Southeast Asian nations. The U.S. Congress is
considering a larger defense package, the multibillion-dollar Asia
Reassurance Initiative (ARA), which is designed to bolster the American
naval footprint and network of alliances in the Asia-Pacific.

Pompeo also reiterated the importance of the \$60 billion U.S.
government-led investment promotion fund, the Better Utilization of
Investments Leading to Development (BUILD) Act, which aims to strengthen
America's investment in strategic regions like Southeast Asia. The Trump
administration has emphasized risks embedded in China's BRI in
juxtaposition to Western and Japanese investments, which comply with
world-class standards of good governance, debt sustainability, and
environmental protection. Washington may not be in a position to match
China's offers dollar-by-dollar, but it's expected to solicit support
from other key allies such as Japan and Australia, which have supported
America\'s vision of quality and sustainable infrastructure in the
region

Japan has in place its own multi-billion-dollar Connectivity Initiative,
which covers a plethora of infrastructure projects across much of
Southeast Asia, while Australia and ASEAN recently agreed to developing
a joint infrastructure project, which "will develop a pipeline of
high-quality infrastructure projects, to attract private and public
investment."

[Economically, Southeast Asian countries have welcomed intensified
competition between China on one hand and the U.S. and its allies on the
other]{.underline}. After all, this means more capital, technology and
investment options, which are crucial for the region's continued
economic prosperity. Yet, there is lingering concern that economic
rivalries are just a prelude to all-out trade wars and naval
confrontation among great powers in the high seas. The last thing ASEAN
countries want is a zero-sum scramble among great powers in their
region.

STATE DEPARTMENT - As [China moves to complete the creation of military
outposts in the South China Sea, Beijing's negotiation with southeastern
Asian nations over a binding code of conduct is gaining momentum**. But
U.S. officials and experts warn China's insertions in the draft South
China Sea code of conduct may put Washington and Beijing on a collision
course.**]{.underline} The text of the draft also shows that deep
divisions remain among claimants. [One of the Chinese provisions in the
text states, **"The Parties shall not hold joint military exercises with
countries from outside the region, unless the parties concerned are
notified beforehand and express no objection."**]{.underline} China also
proposed cooperation on the marine economy "shall not be conducted in
cooperation with companies from countries outside the region." A State
Department spokesperson told VOA the United States is concerned by
reports [China has been pressing members of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations "in the closed-door talks, to accept restrictions on their
ability to conduct exercises with security partners, and to agree not to
conduct oil and gas exploration in their claimed waters with energy
firms based in countries which are not part of the ongoing
negotiations."]{.underline} "These proposals, if accepted, would limit
the ability of ASEAN nations to conduct sovereign, independent foreign
and economic policies and would directly harm the interests of the
broader international community," added the State Department
spokesperson. **[Competing for influence For China, the benefits are
apparent. The United States and China are competing for influence in the
Indo-Pacific region]{.underline}**. China and Southeast Asian navies are
heading to their first joint exercises from October 22 to 28. **[An
inaugural ASEAN-U.S. maritime exercise will be held next
year.]{.underline}** "In other words, China would like a veto over all
the military exercises held by ASEAN countries with other nations. [I
think this really provides some evidence that China indeed is trying to
limit American influence in the region]{.underline}, one might go so far
as to say to push American military presence out of the region
eventually, but certainly in the area of the South China Sea," said
Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington. While the United
States is not a claimant to the sovereignty of disputed islands in the
South China Sea, [Washington has said China\'s efforts to militarize
outposts in the contested waters endanger the free flow of trade and
undermine regional stability, a claim Beijing rebuts. **The United
States is also calling for ongoing discussions on the South China Sea
code of conduct to be transparent and consultative with the rest of the
international community.**]{.underline} U.S. officials said the
international community has direct stakes in the outcome. Code of
conduct draft In August, Singapore\'s Foreign Minister Vivian
Balakrishnan announced China and ASEAN's 10 member countries had reached
a draft agreement. (Single Draft South China Sea Code of Conduct
Negotiating Text or SDNT). ASEAN leaders are to meet next month in
Singapore. Highlighting the importance of such a draft, a Center for
Strategic and International Studies report said for the first time in
many years, an effective diplomatic process to manage South China Sea
disputes seems possible. ASEAN and China have been discussing a
potential code of conduct (COC) to manage the South China Sea maritime
and territorial disputes for more than two decades. [Leaked details of
the [draft ](https://thediplomat.com/2018/08/a-closer-look-at-the-asean-china-single-draft-south-china-sea-code-of-conduct/)state
the code of conduct is "not an instrument to settle territorial disputes
or maritime delimitation issues."]{.underline} Managing disputes, The
draft shows deep divisions among South China Sea claimants over many
issues, according to experts, especially over the most sensitive issues
like the agreement's geographic scope, potential dispute settlement
mechanisms, and details of resource exploration. "[What the code of
conduct is intended to do is to manage the disputes to prevent them from
escalating, and basically to allow the freezing of the thorny
territorial questions, while states can manage the resources and manage
tensions in the near to medium term,]{.underline}" said Gregory Poling,
director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative" at Center for
Strategic and International Studies (CSIS**[). In August a trilateral
statement from Japan, Australia and the [United
States](https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2018/08/284940.htm) called for
the Code of Conduct "to not prejudice the interests of third parties or
the rights of all states under international law; to reinforce existing
regional architecture; and to strengthen parties' commitments to cease
actions that would complicate or escalate
disputes.]{.underline}**" Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense
for South and Southeast Asia Amy Searight said Washington's "concrete
position" on no prejudice against third parties "is to really criticize
China\'s attempt to marginalize U.S. influences" in the region.

a code of conduct in the South China Sea last August by the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations and China has raised hopes that such a code
will ensure lasting peace and stability in the South China
Sea.]{.underline}** While details of the text have yet to be officially
issued, a leaked draft includes **[five critical issues for negotiations
-- "geographic scope", "dispute settlement", "duty to cooperate", "role
of third parties" and "legal status".]{.underline}** In these, [the code
has gone farther than the declaration on conduct with respect to dispute
settlement and duty to cooperate]{.underline}. Proposals on dispute
settlement have included options such as conciliation, mediation and the
activation of the High Council for the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation.
On duty to cooperate, particularly maritime cooperation, the
declaration's five areas of non-traditional security cooperation have
been expanded to include illegal fishing, marine connectivity, and oil
and gas resource cooperation. However, China has floated the idea that
cooperation related to the marine economy should not include
extra-regional countries. [As for confidence-building measures, in
addition to military exchanges, humane treatment of people in distress
and voluntary notification of impending joint military exercises stated
in the DOC, the code of conduct warrants that an exchange of
information, mutual port calls of military vessels and joint patrols and
military exercises be done on a regular basis**. China also seeks to
ensure that a veto power can be exercised over joint military exercises
that are to be conducted with extra-regional countries.**]{.underline}
On self-restraint, the Philippines has suggested [traditional fishing
rights](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2022715/south-china-sea-fishing-rights-top-philippine)
and access to features and fishing grounds be guaranteed while Vietnam
has proposed that there be no further construction of artificial
islands, militarisation of maritime features, blockade of vessels
carrying provisions and personnel, declaration of [Air Defence
Identification
Zones,](https://www.scmp.com/topics/air-defence-identification-zone) and
the simulation of attacks involving aircraft and vessels from other
claimant countries. These calls for proscribing specific actions are
vital because the absence of technical specificity has led to
unpredictable behaviour and regional instability. This is why,
regardless of rounds of non-traditional security cooperation workshops
and dialogue, security complications recur, and confidence-building
measures, such as  [maritime/naval
exercises](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/2169727/china-embarks-first-joint-naval-drills-asean-us-tensions-simmer),

Encounters](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/2169482/china-us-defence-chiefs-agree-asean-rules-encounters-between),
appear to be token gestures. [**While progress has been made, more could
be done on geographic scope, duty to cooperate, role of third parties

include
the [Paracels](https://www.scmp.com/topics/paracel-islands), [Scarborough

and
the [Spratlys](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/1866105/china-vows-continue-building-disputed-islands-reefs)
because these are the areas where maritime incidents have reached crisis
levels.]{.underline} Tensions in these areas have compelled claimant
states, such as the Philippines and Vietnam, to take their case to
Asean. Second, duty to cooperate may include the establishment of joint
marine protected areas, a regional fisheries organisation and an
integrated maritime tourism programme in the Spratlys. China's
artificial islands, given their advanced maritime infrastructure, could
be designated as a hub for promoting non-traditional security
cooperation such as marine scientific research, disaster prevention and
mitigation, and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. **[By
involving China in fostering regional public good and demonstrating
compliance with international environmental laws, threat perceptions
about the military functions of China's man-made islands can be
reoriented.]{.underline}** With respect to self-restraint, prohibitive
clauses should extend to the non-unilateral deployment of oil rigs and
energy exploration, the avoidance of hostile language in radio warnings
to approaching foreign aircraft, not condoning illegal fishing practices
and not using grey-hulled ships in apprehending lawbreaking fishermen.
[Additionally, the notion of "militarisation" needs to be clearly
defined because some equipment and facilities such as "[weather
observation
stations](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/2171271/beijing-opens-weather-stations-artificial-islands-south-china)"
have "dual-use" functions.]{.underline} Third, apart from China, major
powers such

France, Japan, India,

and **[the US have a geopolitical stake in the South China Sea because a

"provocations", **including the US as a party to the code of conduct
should be considered; a code that does not bind Washington would only
continue to cause trouble for Beijing**. If the US participates, other
major powers would also accede]{.underline}. Alternatively, China in
relation to the US and other major powers could articulate its own
framework. Fourth, for the code to be legally binding, there should be a
provision prescribing the sanctions or penalties in the event of
defection or non-compliance by any of the claimant states. **[For Asean,
the code of conduct is important in illustrating institutional capacity
and centrality]{.underline}**. For China, it is an opportunity to
mitigate the cost to its reputation of the creation and militarisation
of artificial islands. [But should the code fail to be effective, both
Asean and China's credibility in managing regional security issues would
seriously be eroded.]{.underline}

### COC Good -- US-China Relations

#### Code of conduct key to US-China relations -- no thumpers

**[Zhou 19]{.underline}** Laura Zhou, 3-4-2019, \"Southeast Asian
nations feel squeeze between US and China,\" South China Morning Post,

Lowell-SB

[Freedom of navigation operations conducted by the US and its allies in
the South China Sea have heightened the dilemma faced by Southeast Asian
nations caught between China and the United States, diplomatic sources
and observers have said.]{.underline}

Many say that [the more frequent naval operations by the US and its
allies in the contested waters may help reinforce international rules in
the face of China\'s military construction programme in the disputed
waters.]{.underline}

But **[they are not convinced that the operations will be enough to
deter China\'s aggressive territorial claims and smaller countries fear
they may pay a price for the US actions.]{.underline}**

\"Claimant nations other than China are wary of Beijing\'s activities in
the area,\" said Collin Koh, a research fellow at the S Rajaratnam
School of International Studies at Nanyang Technological University in
Singapore.

\"This concern certainly motivates them to encourage the continued
presence of friendly, countervailing powers that can hopefully check
Beijing\'s activities and at least, if not roll back on those
activities, to ensure that Beijing is deterred enough to not up the ante
with more drastic, escalatory actions aimed at further altering the
status quo in the South China Sea.\"

**[An Asian diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
escalating rivalry between China and the US was making it more difficult
for his country to remain neutral between the two powers.]{.underline}**

**[\"We can\'t afford to antagonise China. We don\'t want to be stuck in
the middle and be engulfed by the two giants,\" the diplomat
said.]{.underline}**

[The US remains the most powerful military presence in the Indo-Pacific
region, but its activities in the South China Sea mainly take the form
of what it calls freedom of navigation operations, in which its warships
sail near islands or features claimed by China to indicate its view that
they remain international waters.]{.underline}

The US Navy carried out nine such operations in 2017 and 2018. So far
this year it has carried out two exercises and has said more are
planned.

US Navy Commander Admiral Philip Davidson said last month he expected
allies and partners would continue to help the US in the South China Sea
\"in the months ahead\" and that the US was helping the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in its discussions with China about a
code of conduct (CoC), which Beijing has long advocated as a way of
reducing the risk of confrontation in the disputed waters.

Jay Batongbacal, an associate professor at the University of the
Philippines\' college of law, said that while the increasing operations
by the US and its allies, including Australia, Britain and France, could
help \"moderate\" some of Beijing\'s assertive activities, they were
unlikely to deter China.

\"**[An ASEAN-US dialogue on the CoC could help identify and clarify
points of mutual or convergent or complementary interests in the South
China Sea, so that in subsequent negotiations with China, ASEAN could be
more conscious of what regional and extra-regional interests to balance
in the course of the CoC negotiations,\" he said]{.underline}**.

\"It may also provide an opportunity for ASEAN and the US to clarify
their respective roles and directions in dealing with China.\"

But Koh said this would also mean ASEAN nations needed to strike a more
delicate balance.

\"This may help somewhat, on the assumption that ASEAN countries may at
least have extra-regional powers to fall back on and not necessarily
have to cave in to Beijing\'s demands regarding the CoC,\" he said.

\"That said, the ASEAN parties will necessarily have to not only
consider the extra-regional powers\' commitment to the region - which
some may see in the current US administration as possibly tenuous at
best - but also their long-term relations with China which is an
immediate neighbour and with whom there are considerable economic stakes
especially involved.\"

Beijing regards the naval operations conducted by the US and its allies
in the South China Sea as a violation of its territorial sovereignty.

On Thursday, Chinese defence ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang warned that
the military would \"take resolute steps to firmly safeguard the
sovereignty and safety of the country\".

[The growing competition between China and the US - which takes many
forms, including the trade war and increasingly heated race for
technological supremacy - has **heightened Southeast Asian nations\'
fears of being caught in the middle.**]{.underline}

[Beijing may still be hoping to forestal]{.underline}l US freedom of
navigation operations ([FONOPs) in the South China Sea, but even should
FONOPs proceed, China will have cause for celebration.]{.underline}
Indeed, Xi Jinping should already be declaring victory. [Beijing took
stock of the Obama administration, gauged accurately the president's
overriding desire to avoid conflict, and **fine-tuned its level of
assertiveness to achieve Chinese ends**. For years now, China has been
bullying its neighbors, including American treaty allies, and is now
positioning itself to exert control over international waters that have
been crucial both to the global economy and to America's ability to
project power]{.underline} worldwide. Washington has frequently
expressed concern and has begun to deepen its partnerships in the
region, but has failed to prevent China from working to upend the
presiding regional order. True, the United States remains the dominant
military power in the Asia-Pacific and has some important advantages
vis-à-vis China --- namely, a number of capable allies. Even so, Beijing
has succeeded in forcing official Washington to twist itself in knots
over whether to actively defend the freedom of the seas---a mission
which the US Navy has carried out since Thomas Jefferson ordered it to
combat Barbary pirates in the early 19th century. Doing so today should
be "business as usual." It no longer is, at least not in the Spratly
Islands. The Obama administration has taught Xi Jinping a lesson he
should have never been allowed to learn: an American defense of freedom
of the seas is not automatic. Should the president approve FONOPs around
the Spratlys, it will have been after months --- possibly years --- of
deliberation. If Xi had played his cards a little bit differently, he
may conclude, perhaps the deliberations would have gone his way. But the
very fact that Xi forced this prolonged discussion is his victory.
[Unless the Obama administration is **clearly committed to persistent
and sustained FONOPs throughout the South China Sea**---]{.underline}and
given the president's record, there's little reason to expect that is
the case---[Beijing will seek new ways to force Washington to engage in
this debate again and again. **Russia, Iran, and other malign actors
will likewise conclude that freedom of the seas is not sacrosanct ---
that it can be challenged and, as a principle governing relations among
states, potentially weakened.** As in Europe and the Middle East, the
United States has failed to hold the line against those forces opposed
to the liberal international order. Whether the Obama administration can
convince both its adversaries and its allies of a renewed commitment to
that order remains to be seen.]{.underline}

#### Breakdown of FON in the Arctic sparks global nuclear war

**[Dhanapala, 13]{.underline}**

(President-Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs & Former
United Nations under-secretary-general for Disarmament Affairs, The
Arctic as a bridge, 2/4, http://thebulletin.org/arctic-bridge)

No country owns the North Pole or the expanse of the Arctic Ocean
surrounding it. The Arctic region has a population of about 4 million,
including more than 30 distinct groups of indigenous people using dozens
of languages; they have lived there for more than 10,000 years. The area
also has a unique and diverse ecosystem that includes fish, marine
mammals, birds, land animals, and a thriving web of bacteria, viruses,
algae, worms, and crustaceans that live in sea ice. The natural
resources are vast and largely untapped. The US Geological Survey has
estimated that 22 percent of the world\'s undiscovered energy resources
lie in the Arctic zone \-- especially in the submerged plateau, between
the Bering Sea and the Chukchi Sea known as the Chukchi Cap. [The Arctic
has been vital to humanity\'s development]{.underline}, and history has
a strange way of repeating itself. What is now the Bering Strait was
once a land bridge, across which humans migrated from Asia to the
Americas. It promises today to be a maritime conduit for increased
global commerce through the Arctic as human-induced climate change
causes ice to melt and shipping lanes to open. [This development has the
potential to bring nations and peoples together for peace and
development \-- **or to spawn dispute and conflict**.]{.underline} There
are in fact many reasons that the international community \-- and not
just the countries with coastlines on the Arctic Ocean \-- should focus
on the Arctic. First, the world is increasingly interdependent, and the
hard evidence of climate change proves that the felling of Amazon
forests in Brazil and increased carbon dioxide emissions in China have a
cumulative global impact, leading to the incipient disappearance of
Tuvalu into the Pacific Ocean and the gradual sinking of the Maldives.
In a literal sense, English poet John Donne\'s celebrated line \-- \"No
man is an island, entire of itself\" \-- is truer today than ever
before. The environment of the Arctic affects the world environment.
Beyond its contribution to rising sea levels, the melting of the Arctic
ice cap will facilitate the mining of resources, especially oil and gas,
and lead to an increase in commercial shipping. [The ownership of the
resources and the sovereignty of Arctic areas, including the Northwest
Passage, are already being contested. The applicability of the UN
Convention on the Law of the Sea has to be more sharply
defined,]{.underline} especially in those areas of the Arctic where
claims overlap. And clearly, access to the resources of the Arctic north
is of concern to the global south, where the \"bottom billion\" people
of the world live in extreme poverty. Increasingly, science shows that
those people are going to be hit hardest by climate change. Some of
those people also see the area outside the territory claimed by the
littoral states of the Arctic as part of the global commons and,
therefore, the shared heritage of humankind. A global regime could thus
be established over the Arctic to mitigate the effects of climate change
and to provide for the equitable use of its resources outside the
territory of the eight circumpolar countries. Third, as someone who has
devoted most of his working life to the cause of disarmament, and
especially nuclear disarmament, I am deeply concerned that [two nuclear
weapon states \-- the United States and the Russian Federation, which
together own 95 percent of the nuclear weapons in the world \-- face one
another across the Arctic and have competing claims. These]{.underline}
claims \-- not to mention those that could be made by North Atlantic
Treaty Organization member states Canada, Denmark, Iceland, and Norway
\-- **[may lead to conflict that has the potential to escalate into the
use of nuclear weapons]{.underline}**. Thus the Arctic is ripe for
conversion into a nuclear weapon free zone. I discussed a fourth reason
the international community should focus on the Arctic with UN
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon (who has in fact visited the Arctic on an
icebreaker) when I met him in New York last fall. The Arctic, I told
him, is the one region in the world where the environment (and climate
change in particular), the threat of nuclear weapons, the human rights
of indigenous people, and the need to advance the rule of law converge
as international issues. [The Arctic, therefore, offers a unique
opportunity to make international diplomacy work for the benefit of the
entire international community.]{.underline} Security and
interdependence. Security today is a concept that is much broader than
military security alone. It encompasses international peace and
security, human rights, and development. Twenty-first century security
is also a cooperative and common security, in which one region\'s
insecurity inevitably and negatively affects the security of other
regions of the world. And so **[Arctic security is inextricably
interwoven with global security,]{.underline}** giving us all a role as
stakeholders in the north. Geographer Jared Diamond\'s impressive book,
Collapse, shows that not every society faced with environmental collapse
has gone under like Norse Greenland or the Mayan civilization. The
Inuits, for example, have done much better on Greenland than the Norse
and are still with us. Diamond identifies a society\'s response to
environmental problems as the most significant factor contributing to
\-- or forestalling \-- its collapse. Long-term planning and a
willingness to reconsider core values can stave off collapse, Diamond
writes. This is the same lesson that British historian Arnold Toynbee
provided in his A Study of History, with its descriptions of the
challenges humankind has faced throughout history and the responses it
has made.

Richard Sokolsky, Senior Associate at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, and Gordon Adams, Distinguished Fellow at the
Stimson Center, 7/19/2015, Governance and Security Sector Assistance:
The Missing Link---Part II,
<https://www.lawfareblog.com/governance-and-security-sector-assistance-missing-link%E2%80%94part-ii>

In the first part of this article, we suggested that [the success of
U.S. security assistance and cooperation programs]{.underline} would
[depend heavily on the extent to which they were **embedded in a broader
strategy** to **improve governance in recipient
countries**]{.underline}. [Effective]{.underline}, efficient,
accountable, uncorrupt [governance]{.underline}, we think, [is an
essential prerequisite for security assistance that achieves U.S. policy
goals and creates an accountable, effective security sector and military
in recipient countries.]{.underline} Security Sector Assistance The most
direct engagement the U.S. has with the governing institutions of
aid-recipient countries is the military. Setting aside the rather small
proportion of U.S. foreign assistance that directly and purposely
targets "governing justly and democratically," the 25% of U.S. foreign
assistance that targets peace and security constitutes a direct
engagement with what is frequently the strongest sector of
governance---the military and surrounding security institutions.
Moreover, the security assistance funds of the Department of State are
only part of the story. Over the past decade, starting with large
train-and-equip programs in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Department of
Defense (DoD), which has always implemented the State-funded programs,
has become as significant a funder of security assistance (and what the
DoD calls "security cooperation," or "Building Partner Capacity") as the
State Department itself. The effectiveness of much of this total
security assistance investment---which can be more than \$25 billion a
year---is in doubt, in part because it has not been explicitly linked to
recipient country performance in the areas of governance. The State
Department portfolio of programs (see Table 1), including the Foreign
Military Financing Program (FMF), International Narcotics Control and
Law Enforcement Programs (INCLE), International Military Education and
Training (IMET), and Peacekeeping Operations (PKO), are largely focused
on training and equipping foreign military forces. Implemented by the
U.S. military and security assistance contractors, these programs have
helped in some cases to achieve narrow military objectives---for
instance, improving the combat capabilities of allies and partners and
the interoperability of U.S. and coalition partner forces. In addition,
the assistance the United States has provided over the past decade to
the armed forces of the Philippines and Columbia has helped to root out
stubborn insurgencies and U.S. military assistance to former Warsaw Pact
countries have improved their military capabilities and strengthened
their capacity to operate with U.S. forces in the Balkans and
Afghanistan. The growing portfolio of programs funded through the
Defense Department (see Table 2) has added to the size and dispersal of
such programs, including the Section 1206 program and training and
equipping the Afghanistan and Iraq militaries. Overall, the DoD
portfolio of directly funded security cooperation programs has amounted,
in some years, to over \$10 billion in additional funding. Moreover, the
expansion of the DoD portfolio continues, with the more recent
announcement of a South East Asian Maritime Security Initiative, which
could make as much as \$425 million available for five countries in that
region over the next five years. DoD policy makers argue that this
portfolio of new, DoD-funded efforts was needed, in part, because the
traditional array of programs at State operated under bureaucratic
restrictions and requirements that made them slow and unresponsive to
short-term needs. In reality, however, much of the DoD activity is
administered by precisely the same bureaucratic organization---the
Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA)---that implements FMF and
IMET. The bureaucratic constraints and obstacles, in other words, are
more likely to be encountered inside the DoD organization than at State.
[Overall, U.S. train-and-equip programs have not achieved great success
in encouraging foreign military partners to operate and govern their
regular armed forces in accordance with the rule of law and democratic
norms]{.underline}, despite some training and rhetoric that includes
this goal. Moreover, it is far from clear that these programs achieve
even the more limited objectives of developing recipient country
capability or giving the U.S. enduring influence. The primary content of
these programs, particularly the large DoD effort, is providing
equipment and associated training (T&E) to the recipient. For
policymakers, this is seen as the most immediate way of providing
assistance, as opposed to longer-term force development and security
sector reform. However, for recipients, this may not be the most useful
form of assistance, often leading to the deterioration of the equipment
for lack of training, sustainable funding, or use. The long-term
impacts, outcomes, and performance resulting from U.S. security
assistance programs are generally not well tracked and evaluated,
particularly by DoD. And they are almost certainly not tracked in terms
of their impact on overall governance objectives. There have been
catastrophic failures of security assistance programs in Iraq and Yemen.
The large and sustained U.S. assistance to Egyptian military forces
permitted dialogue with the Egyptian military during the Arab Spring,
but could not prevent a military coup and it has been frequently used to
conduct "scorched earth" operations in the Sinai that have killed
civilians and caused extensive damage to civilian infrastructure. (For
the largest recipients of security assistance/cooperation funding in
recent years, see Table 3.) [America's security sector investment
strategy has been even less successful at, and significantly less
focused on, improving and reforming the internal security forces (e.g.,
police, paramilitary, and interior ministry forces) of foreign
partners]{.underline}. It has become painfully clear in the wake of the
2011 Arab uprisings in Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Syria, Iraq, and Bahrain
that the domestic practices of these forces cause major problems for
government accountability, legitimacy, internal security, the security
of civilian populations, and U.S. interests throughout the Arab world.
Beyond the Arab world U.S. trained and equipped forces have repeatedly
committed atrocious human rights abuses and engaged in grotesque levels
of corruption, fanning Islamic terrorism and other forms of violent
extremism. The Nigerian armed forces' war against Boko Haram, which
features large-scale human rights abuses, is the poster child for this
problem, but it has also occurred in such places as Burundi, Mali,
Uganda, and South Sudan. Overall, the poorly evaluated U.S. security
assistance and "Building Partner Capacity" programs appear to have at
best a mixed record of success at their initial
objective---strengthening security forces themselves---and a potentially
counter-productive effect on civilian governance in general and over
those strengthened security forces. The administration is not entirely
unaware of this problem. It has, at least on paper, set out reasonable
goals and principles to govern U.S. security sector policies and
programs. Presidential Policy Directive 23, U.S. Security Sector
Assistance Policy (PDD-23), issued in April 2013, directs all U.S.
security sector assistance programs to help partner nations not only
build sustainable capacity to address common security challenges, but
also to promote universal values such as good governance. It has become
painfully clear in the wake of the 2011 Arab uprisings in Egypt, Libya,
Yemen, Syria, Iraq, and Bahrain that the domestic practices of these
forces cause major problems for government accountability, legitimacy,
internal security, the security of civilian populations, and U.S.
interests throughout the Arab world. The more recent Security Governance
Initiative (SGI), announced in August 2014 by the White House and the
leaders of Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and Tunisia, was a
positive first step in allocating security sector assistance on the
basis of PDD-23 principles. The initiative in particular focuses on: 1)
the systems, processes, and institutions that reinforce democratic
security sector governance; and 2) increasing partner nation capacity to
meet citizen security needs, such as accessing justice, and promoting
democratic governance, rule of law, and respect for human rights. The
SGI also sounds all the right notes about improving measurements of
performance and results and holding recipients accountable for meeting
their commitments. Unfortunately, the SGI did not go far enough. The six
countries "chosen" to participate in the program were, in fact,
"pre-selected"---in other words there was no requirement that they first
meet the new standards and conditions embodied in the SGI before
receiving their share of the \$65 million set aside for the initiative.
Additionally, the initiative was focused exclusively on six African
countries; funds for it were therefore fenced-off from any competition
from other countries both inside and outside of Africa that might have
performed better in meeting SGI's more exacting standards. Moreover, at
\$65 million in this fiscal year, the program is small. And the funding
for the program came from internal funding transfers, some of which
actually took funds away from USAID governance programs. Aligning future
security assistance with the objectives of PPD-23 is a challenge.
Several issues need to be addressed not only to ensure that the security
assistance funds are effective in their own right, but also to achieve
the broader linkage we recommend with the objective of strengthened
governance overall: America doles out assistance to far too many
countries to make a difference or to provide any leverage, both with
respect to security sector reform and to the broader governance goal.
The State Department has just proposed a combined budget of almost \$8.3
billion to assist the security sectors of over 130 foreign governments,
and the vast bulk of these funds are "earmarked" for Israel, Egypt,
Columbia, and Jordan. At least half of the remaining recipients of FMF
received roughly \$2 million each. The DoD programs provide upwards of
\$10 billion in assistance, but that is largely concentrated in
Afghanistan and more recently in Iraq and Syria. The United States
cannot help build and sustain meaningful security sector capacity, let
alone link it to governance reform, with such small sums.
Administrations need to target their investments on fewer, strategically
important countries to get more bang for the limited bucks.
Administrations over the years have thrown good money after bad. **[U.S.
security assistance programs]{.underline}** **[should target
countries]{.underline}** that are capable of **[linking security force
capabilities with stronger governance]{.underline}**. [The United States
needs to allocate some security sector assistance to the most fragile
states, because many are fertile breeding grounds for internal and
regional conflict. But our security sector aid has become heavily skewed
towards]{.underline} strategic [partners who show no interest in
governance reform]{.underline} (Egypt, Pakistan) and some of the world's
most poorly governed countries (Nigeria, Yemen, Liberia). If governance
is the critical variable in determining a successful outcome, assistance
to the weakest-governed countries is the most likely to fail. The
weakest are nearly impossible to turn around, primarily because the
rent-seeking elites that run many of them have little incentive to
create good governance when they profit so much from bad governance.
Security assistance is not the answer for these countries; governance
support is. Future administrations need to shift security sector
investments away from the un-reforming partners and the basket cases
toward states that can actually achieve positive results, both in
security and governance, with U.S. funding. The United States has
allowed too many countries to treat our assistance as entitlement
programs, rather than pushing them to reform either the security sector
or overall governance. Over the last decade, the overwhelming majority
of countries receiving FMF were allocated roughly the same amount of
funds each year, regardless of their performance. This is a recipe for
moral hazard: If a government receives funds regardless of results, it
has little incentive to work for them. Allocating funds solely to buy
influence is probably politically unavoidable, but investing in a
country to produce security gains should require proof that these
investments have prompted the recipient to take action it would not have
otherwise taken. Poor performers need to be taken off the rolls.
Measurements of performance and results focus too heavily on inputs
rather than outcomes, and recipients are rarely held accountable for the
results. Measuring gains in security and governance is hard. To their
credit, the Departments of State and Defense are improving their
monitoring and evaluation of security assistance programs, though only
in the context of developments in the military and security sectors. It
remains to be seen whether future decisions to allocate security sector
assistance will reflect these findings. It is sobering and instructive,
for example, that over the past several years, according to the Fund for
Peace, almost all recipients of security sector assistance saw their
security scores worsen slightly, on average, from what they had been
before the investments started. This may, in part, be due to the absence
of attention to the links between security and governance. A New
Paradigm [U.S. security assistance and cooperation programs have been
less successful than administrations have hoped and may have actually
**worsened** the security of many recipient countries.]{.underline} In
our view, **[such programs are likely to be]{.underline}** more
**[effective if they are]{.underline}** more selective,
**[better]{.underline}** monitored, and **[linked, with real
consequences, to recipient country performance with respect to both the
internal operations of the security sector and the broader objective
of]{.underline}** **[effective]{.underline}**, efficient,
**[accountable, and uncorrupt governance]{.underline}**. How might this
outcome be advanced? **[The foreign economic assistance program of the
Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) offers a model for revamping U.S.
security sector assistance to lash it up more effectively with efforts
to improve governance]{.underline}**. [The MCC]{.underline}
**[decision-making process is]{.underline}** much more selective and
**[conditional]{.underline}** than traditional development assistance.
**[It requires potential assistance recipients to measure
up]{.underline}** to 16 broadly accepted indicators of good governance
before they are eligible for MCC funding. [Countries that meet these
standards are treated more like partners than aid
recipients]{.underline}. They develop and take ownership of their own
plans for how MCC funds will be used to advance economic growth and
human security. Countries are selected for participation based on their
performance, and the amount of funding they receive is determined by the
quality of their plans, formalized in "compacts" with the MCC. Because
MCC funds are limited and the program is highly selective, prospective
MCC partners are, in effect, challenged to compete for funding with
other countries. Once countries sign a compact, the MCC applies
stringent performance and evaluation controls to monitor and hold MCC
partners accountable for results. Poor country performance in meeting
its commitments under their compacts can and has been penalized by the
termination of the compact (e.g., Nicaragua, Mali). MCC countries are
incentivized to improve their policy performance to meet standards that
both improve governance and advance U.S. national objectives. The MCC
format and experience to date might be a useful approach to U.S.
security assistance programs. The small SGI program suggests **[there is
interest in linking broader governance performance to
funding]{.underline}**. **[This approach would establish a set of
broader governance criteria]{.underline}**, as well as criteria
**[specifically related to security sector behavior]{.underline}**, that
would determine the initial eligibility of countries for assistance. The
U.S. would establish a "challenge fund" consisting of the bulk of U.S.
security assistance funds, for which potential recipient countries could
compete. [**To be successful, the stewards of this fund would need to
establish** **stringent performance standards**]{.underline} both for
overall governance and **[for security sector governance that competing
countries would have to meet before they are declared eligible and
selected for participation in the fund]{.underline}**. For example (the
list below is illustrative and not exhaustive), governments should: Be
committed to civilian-led accountable institutions and have a military
that only acts under civilian command and with clear and transparent
rules of engagement. Make military/security capabilities, budget data,
and weapons procurement transparent to civilian authorities and not
allow the military to own productive resources in the civilian economy.
Require military/security training to include human rights,
accountability to civilians and civilian institutions, and adherence to
rule of law and prohibit military/security forces from detaining
individuals indefinitely or without trial. Have defense and interior
ministries headed by civilians appointed through an accountable process,
with low measures of corruption, as MCC uses. Have legislatures with
capacity for effective oversight of military/security ministries and
with budget/appropriations role for these budgets. Have a free press
allowed to scrutinize and report on military and security force budgets
and activities without repression. Have clear rules of engagement for
dealing with internal unrest that meet international standards and do
not use military/security forces for internal political repression. Make
an adequate investment of resources for training in the areas of
democratic and community-oriented policing and have an investigatory
framework that does not rely on torture and forced confession.
Conclusion U[.S. national security policy has put a high priority on
dealing with the problem of fragile, failing, and failed states
suffering from poor governance, weak institutions, limited state
capacity, and unaccountable and repressive security sectors. The United
States' most significant engagement with these states has been with
their security institutions]{.underline}---the military, interior
forces, and police---[through security assistance and DoD's Building
Partner Capacity programs]{.underline}. **[However, evidence suggests
that these programs may actually increase state weakness and reduce
internal security in many countries.]{.underline}** **[To address this
problem, the United States needs to embed its security assistance
efforts in a broader context of strengthening effective]{.underline}**,
efficient, accountable, and uncorrupt **[governance]{.underline}**. [One
step in this direction would be to **link the bulk of U.S. security
assistance dollars to broader governance behavior and reforms, as well
as to specific behavior in the security sector itself. Until security
assistance is integrated with a coherent strategy to improve governance,
U.S. administrations will make little progress in closing the gap
between their ambitions and actual progress in addressing the failed
state problem.**]{.underline}

Undergirding U.S. Diplomacy In addition to empowering allies and
partners[, U.S. security assistance has an added strategic benefit: it
helps solidify diplomatic ties between these countries and the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. [It helps **solidify
partnerships and ensure their durability**]{.underline}. [The reason the
State Departmentas the lead diplomatic agencyalso directs security
assistance and regulates exports of military hardware is because these
programs have broad foreign policy implications. Security assistance and
the export of military systems, either as a government-to-government
transfer or commercial transfer, is fundamentally a foreign policy act.
Reaching out a hand to assist and secure a partner country can
immediately and directly advance diplomatic relationships. **If a
country is willing to cooperate in the sensitive area of national
defense, they are more likely to cooperate in other areas as well**.
When a country acquires an advanced U.S. defense system, they are not
simply buying a product]{.underline} to enhance their security[, they
are also seeking a relationship with the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. The United States promotes a total package
approach to Foreign Military Sales where we provide not just the weapons
platform, but the spare parts and training required to operate and
maintain the weapons system. [**When the U.S. transfers a weapon system,
it is not just providing a country with military hardware, it is both**
**reinforcing diplomatic relations and establishing a long-term security
partnership**]{.underline}. **[The complex and technical nature of
advanced defense systems frequently requires collaboration and
interaction between countries]{.underline}**. This may include training
and support in the use of the system, assistance in maintenance, and
help to update and modernize the system throughout its life-cycle.
[**This engagement helps build bilateral ties and creates** **strong
incentives for recipient countries to maintain good relations** **with
the United States**. Security assistance therefore helps undergird these
diplomatic relationships]{.underline}. One way to conceptualize the
transfer of an advanced defense system, such as a fighter aircraft, is
to think about the sale of a new smart-phone. When someone buys a
smart-phone, they are not simply buying a piece of hardware; they are
buying a system that includes the operating system; the system's
software for email, photos, and music; as well as access to many other
available applications. Therefore, an individual is in fact entering
into a relationship with a particular smart-phone company over the life
of that phone. Similarly, when a country buys a fighter jet or other
advanced defense system from a U.S. company, they are not just getting
the hardware; they are buying a larger system, one that will need to be
updated and repaired throughout its lifespan, which in the case of a
fighter jet can be as long as 40 years. This means that [in purchasing
the hardware, the buyer is actually committing to a broader long-term
relationship with the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.
[**Should a country decide to** **break** **with the United States, they
would potentially** **endanger their access** to all the technology,
parts, and components which make that piece of hardware work as
intended. Defense trade decisions are therefore often intensely
political decisions that **steer the diplomatic strategic course of a
country for decades**]{.underline}**. [Expanding the defense trade is
therefore a critical component of our engagement with both longstanding
allies and new potential partners]{.underline}**. Making arms transfer
decisions requires a significant focus on human rights and democracy.
These have never been more central to U.S. foreign policy, and as a
result they play a crucial role in determining the manner of our
security assistance. Sometimes, however, values have to be reconciled
with other interests. When this occurs, decisions on how to proceed are
guided by the Conventional Arms Transfer Policy, which requires a
careful examination of issues like human rights, regional security, and
nonproliferation concerns to determine if a sale is in the best foreign
policy and national security interests of the United States. As
Secretary Clinton said in June at an event marking the 35th Anniversary
of the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, ''a world that is
more democratic is a world with fewer adversaries and more partners.
Now, creating this world is not easy, and it's not always clear how we
get there. And yes, there are the inevitable tradeoffs. There, by
necessity, always will be. But the mission remains the same.''7 Issues
of human rights and democracy therefore are major factors in shaping
whom the United States will partner with and the manner of that
assistance. It is also important to note that **[security assistance
gives the United States leverage and influence, which can be used to
press for support for U.S. values and interests]{.underline}**. Indeed,
**[U.S. security assistance regularly promotes]{.underline}** such
universal values as **[good governance, civilian oversight of security
forces, rule of law, and respect for human rights]{.underline}**.
**[Security assistance helps tie a country's security sector to the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, **[and creates strong
incentives for the recipient countries to maintain close relations, both
in times of stability and in crisis]{.underline}**. [This does not
guarantee a country will listen. **But clearly, where the United States
has limited relations and no**]{.underline} history of **[security
assistance, U.S. influence to push countries to respect democracy and
human rights will be similarly limited]{.underline}**. This is also why
the State Department carefully scrutinizes all arms transfers. When we
partner with a country or sell a defense article, that engagement must
be deemed to advance broader U.S. foreign policy. In accordance with the
Arms Export Control Act and the Foreign Assistance Act, the Secretary of
State oversees and authorizes all arms sales to ensure they meet this
goal. The Bureau of Political---Military Affairs also ensures that all
sales and arms transfers are reviewed and assessed. Every item
transferred must meet with U.S. legal obligations, foreign policy goals,
and values. If an export license or transfer is approved, foreign
recipients are bound by end-use restrictions and conditions. This grants
U.S. government officials access to monitor how a country will use that
defense article throughout its lifetime. The United States also
investigates potential violations and takes appropriate action depending
on the nature and scope of the infraction. Importantly, the transfer of
items above a certain value also requires the approval of Congress,
which helps ensure a generally broad support for all significant arms
transfers. This arms transfer process sometimes causes consternation
among our international partners, who gripe about onerous rules and
procedures. For example, countries often complain about limitations on
technology transfer and uncertainty caused by bureaucratic and
legislative processes. At times, it makes countries reluctant to partner
with the United States. However, these safeguards are critical to U.S.
foreign policy and are aggressively enforced. Growing Demand to Partner
Despite the high bar for approving transfers and the aggressive
monitoring, more and more countries want to partner with the United
States. This year, the State Department released the 655 Reportan annual
report of defense articles and services that were authorized for export.
Part of this report focused on Direct Commercial Sales (DCS), which
involve foreign entities purchasing directly from U.S. companies, and it
showed that FY2011 items authorized for transfer increased by \$10
billion. Additionally, in 2011, the State Department's Directorate for
Defense Trade Controls, regulator of commercial export of defense items,
processed more than 83,000 licensesthe most ever. FY2012 is also a
record-breaking year for Foreign Military Sales, as they have already
surpassed \$60 billion. This represents about a \$30 billion increase
over FY11. This is also a significant increase over the last decade,
when Foreign Military Sales averaged \$12 billion. This demonstrates
that countries want to partner with the United States. The explosion of
economic growth in certain areas has brought newfound prosperity to a
number of countries, countries which now seek to modernize their
security sectors or acquire new capabilities. Frequently, these
countries turn to the United States and to the U.S. defense industry
because of the United Sates' undeniable military strength, both in
equipment and training. This is of tremendous importance to U.S.
national security. Sales abroad help maintain the defense industrial
base. Today, exports support roughly one-third of defense industry
output.8 These sales therefore support tens of thousands of American
jobs and help the U.S. defense industry maintain the capabilities and
expertise needed to meet the defense needs of the United States. The
growth in [sales]{.underline} also [signals that the diplomatic efforts
to strengthen America's image abroad, build new
partnerships]{.underline}, and bolster longstanding ones, [**has been
effective**. If countries **view the United States unfavorably**, they
will be **less willing to cooperate** on security matters]{.underline}.
[This is why the current U.S. administration has sought to
revitalize]{.underline} U.S. diplomatic engagement, especially relating
to [security assistance]{.underline} and defense trade. This spring, I
was in India for the first political---military talks in six years.
These talks were an opportunity to strengthen our security relationship
with New Delhi, a relationship that includes a broad range of exercises
that our militaries conduct together. One of the major goals during
these talks was to advance the defense trade and better familiarize the
Indian government with U.S. systems and processes. Engagement with India
is making a difference, as cumulative defense sales have grown from
almost nothing to more than \$8 billion since 2008. Security assistance
and defense trade has been a critical part in strengthening the
bilateral relationship. The Obama administration has also actively
engaged Brazil, since Brazil is seeking to modernize and expand its
military capabilities. Last year, I travelled to Brasilia to restart
political---military talks, and this past February a Brazilian
delegation travelled toWashington, as we hope to make this an annual
dialogue. [Security assistance is]{.underline} [also an essential part
of our outreach]{.underline} to the Asia---Pacific, [strengthening the
web of security relationships]{.underline}. In addition, [we are
building new partnerships with emerging powers]{.underline}, which will
be crucial to sustaining the regional stability that has facilitated
rapid economic growth in the Asia---Pacific region.

#### Conditioning arm sales to Southeast Asia on human rights key to US cred in other contexts

**[Stohl 17]{.underline}** (Rachel Stohl, a Senior Associate and
Director of the Conventional Defense program at the Stimson Center,
"Trump's Opportunity to Support Transparency, Accountability on the
Conventional Arms Trade,"
<https://www.stimson.org/content/trump-opportunity-support-transparency-accountability-conventional-arms-trade)>

So, what will the conventional arms landscape look like under the Trump
administration? Thus far, it is unclear what Trump's view towards arms
sales may be, as little was articulated on the subject during the
campaign or transition. However, we can draw some prognostications based
on Trump's personal and his appointees' attitudes and with regard to
relations with allies and national security priorities.

For example, it is unlikely that President Trump will call for a review
and revamping of the U.S. Conventional Arms Transfer Policy. It took 19
years to update the policy, and the new policy reflects the current
security environment --- with a focus on counterterrorism. Indeed, the
policy provides enough flexibility to support Trump's economically
focused interests, and given that Trump has expressed other, more
pressing priorities, the administration likely will not find it
necessary to spend time and resources on a comprehensive review.
However, Trump may move to streamline some of the bureaucracy
responsible for arms transfer decisions and eliminate key offices or
positions within the State Department.

Additionally, [given Trump's views on job creation and the importance of
supporting U.S. industry, it is likely that the new administration will
continue the practice of sending arms to U.S. allies to support U.S.
interests]{.underline}. But, he also could make such sales contingent on
certain behaviors or actions and challenge the reliability of the United
States as a supplier. Some U.S. customers are concerned about a
transactional approach to arms sales under the Trump administration,
which could undermine defense relationships and reliability.
[Signs]{.underline} also [point to the continuation of the export
control reform process under Trump, particularly with regard to Foreign
Military Sales and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations
(ITAR).]{.underline} This could be a positive sign for industry, which
has favored a more streamlined and predictable approach to arms sales,
though critics argue [current export control reform efforts have
undermined oversight, transparency, and accountability.]{.underline}

Overall, in the short-term, [arms sales are likely to continue at the
high levels]{.underline} seen in the Obama administration. This could be
particularly true with regard to countries in the Middle East, which
have historically been major purchasers of U.S. weapons. Indeed, the
Obama administration made over \$115 billion worth of arms sales
agreements to Saudi Arabia alone, as part of 42 separate deals, since
2009, which according to expert William Hartung is "more than any U.S.
administration in the history of the U.S.-Saudi relationship." One could
also argue U.S. arms sales could go down, as Trump has repeatedly
expressed disinterest in getting involved in Middle East affairs, and
his call to governments to take the lead in attending to their own
security concerns, and not always relying on the United States. However,
on the flipside those same words could indicate a possible increase in
U.S. arms sales, as Trump could trade the provision of weapons for
minimal political engagement.

[Based on Trump's past statements]{.underline}, including s[upport for
known dictators and human rights abusers such as Russia's Vladmir Putin
and the Philippines' Rodrigo Duterte, as well as Secretary of State Rex
Tillerson's testimony during his confirmation hearing, human rights
violations are unlikely to be major criteria in determining arms sales
authorizations. Allowing weapons to flow unimpeded]{.underline} to human
rights abusers [opens the door for U.S. arms sales to human rights
abusing governments in the Middle East, Latin America and
Asia]{.underline}, and allows the United States to compete with Russia
and Iran for arms sales to the world's worst dictators. The Trump
administration will have to decide if that is the legacy it wants to
leave at the end of its term.

PRAGMATIC STEPS: The Obama administration had a proven track record of
using conventional arms sales to support national security and foreign
policy priorities, including counterterrorism interests. The Trump
administration will need to decide to what extent it will use
conventional arms sales to achieve its objectives. During its first 100
days in office, [the Trump administration would do well to take the
following steps on the conventional arms trade:]{.underline}

[Review all pending and future arms sales to consider potential human
rights risks]{.underline}. Although considering the human rights impact
of U.S. arms sales is mandated by U.S. law, human rights often take a
back seat to other policy considerations when determining whether to
authorize an arms sale. Indeed current Chair of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, Senator Bob Corker, announced recently that human
rights concerns do not belong in arms transfer decisions and could be
dealt with in other ways. However, **[conditioning arms sales to ensure
that human rights are protected helps uphold U.S. foreign policy values,
protects U.S. industry from complicity in human rights abuses, and
ultimately serves key strategic interests.]{.underline}**

[Consider long(er)-term regional/international stability implications of
potential arms sales]{.underline} in addition to short-term economic
benefits. President Trump has thus far demonstrated and economic
cost/benefit analysis to policy decisions. However, [arms
sales]{.underline}, while potentially providing an economic benefit in
the short-term, [can result in longer-term costs in terms of risks to
U.S. soldiers on the ground --- through blowblack --- as well as risks
in exacerbating and prolonging armed conflicts, and potentially
contributing to a need for U.S. intervention]{.underline}. It is wise to
look at the full potential impact of a U.S. arm sale, ensuring it is
fully compliant with existing U.S. policy and regulations --- and makes
good business sense. 

[Support transparency and accountability of global arms
transfers]{.underline}. Although the United States has a robust arms
transfer system, including public reporting of U.S. arms sales and
security assistance, other countries are less transparent. The United
States should be concerned with the global trends in the arms trade ---
to identify potentially destabilizing build-ups or increased transfers
to/from a particular country and/or region. [The Trump administration
cannot simply take a transactional approach to arms sales, but rather
must examine arms sales in context. To acquire this global picture, the
United States must ensure that it provides information and data to
global arms transfer transparency instruments and encourage other
governments to participate as well. ]{.underline}

#### Security sector reform independently solves the case---But without it, the adv is inevitable

**[Hutton 10]{.underline}**

Lauren Hutton, Researcher with the Security Sector Governance Programme
of the ISS, 2010, FOLLOWING THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD? CURRENT AND FUTURE
CHALLENGES FOR SECURITY SECTOR REFORM IN AFRICA,
https://www.cigionline.org/sites/default/files/the_future_of_security_sector_reform.pdf

[SSR is]{.underline} viewed **[as a key activity]{.underline}** [in the
pursuit of peace and security in Africa.]{.underline} [The quest for
stability in Africa is based on the recognition that without security
there can be no development. Addressing the humanitarian crises
facing]{.underline} many [states]{.underline} throughout the continent
and meeting the UN Millennium Development Goals [can only be achieved if
the susceptibility to violent conflict is overcome. The outbreak of
conflict in Africa is generally tied to internal dynamics and
competition for access to national political and economic
resources]{.underline}. When expressed in environments historically
geared towards elitist control and the restriction of political space,
[the interface between competition, power and scarcity creates a
proclivity for violent conflict]{.underline}.

As expressed by Bryden, N'Diaye and Olonisakin (2008: 3):

**[At the heart of the African insecurity]{.underline}** story **[is the
breakdown in governance systems due in large part to rule by patronage
and the associated misuse of governmental instruments of coercion to
entrench political and social exclusion]{.underline}**. At best, while
maintaining a façade of viability and stability, [this situation has
created state repression of local populations under authoritarian
regimes concerned]{.underline}, above all, [with preserving the regime
rather than ensuring security of the state and its citizens. At worst,
it has led to the outbreak of armed conflict and humanitarian
tragedy.]{.underline}

The **[crisis of governance lies at the centre of insecurity in
Africa]{.underline}**. The governance crisis is manifest in the nature
and functioning of state institutions and in the manner in which the
role of these institutions is conceived. **[The primary argument
of]{.underline}** the post-conflict reconstruction and **[SSR agendas is
that if the manner in which the state institutions function is
fundamentally altered, the propensity for conflict is dramatically
decreased]{.underline}**. The normative basis for this is that democracy
and [good governance are the tools that should guide the transformation
of the state to serve as a conduit for security and
development]{.underline}. In the most optimistic terms, travelling the
"yellow brick road" of democracy and [good governance will lead Africa
towards a new era]{.underline} characterised by freedom from fear and
freedom from want.

**[Because of the role that state security structures have played in the
internal conflicts of Africa, transformation of the security sector is a
central activity in overcoming the legacy of violent
conflict]{.underline}** and authoritarian rule that has plagued many
countries. Furthermore, [the extent to which militias, guerrilla groups
and various non-statutory forces have become characteristic of conflict
in Africa drives the need to redefine the security service providers in
a post-conflict situation and to create an environment in which
political and social tensions are not expressed through
violence.]{.underline}

#### US Human rights leadership is key to democracy and solves great power war.

International Studies. 3-8-2017, \"When the U.S. Gives Up on Human
Rights, Everyone Suffers,\" Foreign Policy,

//DashW)

Last month, the White House unveiled its "hard power" budget blueprint,
which proposed a \$54-billion increase in defense and national security
spending, along with massive cuts to foreign assistance and multilateral
funding. President Donald [Trump intended]{.underline} the budget [to
send a message to allies and adversaries alike that the United States
will put American security and interests first]{.underline}. Absent from
this document was any mention of the values and freedoms that have long
been the foundation of U.S. foreign policy. This is a mistake. [Despotic
and kleptocratic governments all over the world will take this as proof
that they have carte blanche to crack down on their
citizens]{.underline}, [while human rights defenders will conclude that
they have been abandoned by the United States.]{.underline} More
importantly, **[such sentiments threaten the global norms and alliances
that have propelled American prosperity and security since the end of
World War II.]{.underline}**

It is too early to tell how the promotion of human rights will feature
in this administration's foreign policy. On Monday, the White House
notably called on Russia to release all of the peaceful protestors
detained during large anti-corruption protests over the weekend. Press
Secretary Sean Spicer went further, underscoring the right of people
everywhere to accountable government and to "exercise their rights
without fear of retribution." This was the first mention by the Trump
administration of human rights abuses in Russia or elsewhere, and was a
positive first step. However, it came on the heels of many statements
and indications that the administration will put human rights on the
back burner.

For example, the president called Abdel Fattah al-Sisi a "fantastic
guy," in spite of the Egyptian strongman's attempts to muzzle the media,
independent civil society organizations, and others who dare to speak
out against his rule. Trump apparently endorsed Philippine President
Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs that has been responsible for the
unlawful killing of over 7,000 suspected drug dealers and users. Rumors
abound that the administration is considering pulling out of the U.N.
Human Rights Council, an international body that has been greatly
strengthened by America's engagement. And the White House seems to be in
favor of moving forward with the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Bahrain,
despite the government's intensified clampdown on the political
opposition and plan to try civilians in military courts.

Of course, [U.S. global leadership on democracy and human rights is not
merely based on what it says or does overseas.]{.underline} **[What
matters more is the example that America sets]{.underline}**. By that
measure, the Trump administration has already significantly eroded U.S.
credibility. Why would another country listen to the United States about
protecting vulnerable populations, given perceptions that the
immigration and refugee executive order was religiously motivated? What
authority does America have standing up for besieged journalists when
the president of the United States has tweeted that the news media is
the "enemy of the American People?" How can U.S. diplomats press
security partners to protect civilians during military operations while
the White House is contemplating loosening drone strike restrictions
that seek to prevent civilian casualties? Rights-abusing countries will
have a much easier time brushing away U.S. criticisms of their behavior
so long as these deficiencies persist at home.

Authoritarian governments --- weary of the United States prodding them
on human rights and critical of what they perceive as Western meddling
in their sovereign affairs --- are likely celebrating this turn of
events. The president of Turkey, Recip Tayyip Erdogan, welcomed Trump's
election and heralded an era of greater cooperation. Increasingly
rebuked by the Obama administration for his consolidation of power and
crackdown on the military and judiciary, especially after a failed coup
attempt in July 2016, Erdogan has much to gain by the United States
looking the other way as Turkey creeps toward authoritarianism.
Countries from Saudi Arabia to Cambodia appear less inhibited in going
after political opponents, assuming that Trump's election means that
they will get a free pass on human rights violations.

By no means is authoritarian retrenchment a new phenomenon. For the past
decade[, governments have been dismantling democratic institutions and
curtailing human rights.]{.underline} Freedom House has documented 11
straight years in which there have been more declines in political and
civil liberties than gains. However, [the United States often served as
a check on the worst impulses of autocrats. Without a champion of human
rights in the White House, such regimes will likely go unchallenged as
they commit egregious abuses and power grabs.]{.underline}

**[This capitulation would have major security and economic consequences
for the United States and its closest allies]{.underline}**. In addition
to the moral imperative[, America has strong interests in supporting
democracy and human rights abroad.]{.underline}

First, [democratic countries make the best, most stable
partners]{.underline}. [Democracies are more likely to form alliances
and cooperate with other democracies and less likely to get embroiled in
conflict.]{.underline} [The U.S. military understands the value of
having partners that respect human rights and the rule of
law,]{.underline} and thus invests billions a year in enhancing the
professionalism of security forces overseas. Recent research has
deepened our understanding of the benefits for American security of
having broad and deep ties to other countries. In a statistical analysis
of Muslim-majority countries' cooperation with the United States on
counterterrorism, Peter S. Henne found states that received more foreign
assistance were more collaborative than those that did not. Conversely,
[**emboldened dictators tend to pursue foreign policy agendas that are
erratic and destructive for the United States and its allies**. North
Korean ruler Kim Jong Un's spate of nuclear tests and missile launches
and Russian President Vladimir Putin's annexation of Crimea and
incursions into eastern Ukraine are emblematic of the kind of aggressive
behavior the international community has come to expect from autocratic
leaders.]{.underline}

Second, contrary to the president's assertions, the United States has
benefitted immensely from the liberal world order that it helped create.
From the ashes of World War II, [America invested in interlocking
political and economic institutions, alliances, and norms --- based on
universal human rights, shared values, and the rule of law
---]{.underline} [**that would prevent large-scale conflict and
displacement in the future** and fuel Europe's recovery from the
war.]{.underline} The United States has been both the primary engine and
beneficiary of this liberal international order. To be clear, inequality
has been a terrible byproduct of this system --- and too many have been
left behind. But, far from being victimized by globalization, [the
United States has enjoyed nearly 70 years of unparalleled influence
because of its investment in the promotion of democracy and human
rights.]{.underline}

Finally, U.S. support for democracy and human rights matters in people's
lives. It is true that the United States has been far from perfect in
championing human rights, especially where America has short-term
security interests. Yet **[there is no other country that can substitute
for the United States when it comes to fighting for universal
freedoms]{.underline}**. American presidents, members of Congress, and
cabinet secretaries have personally intervened to get political
prisoners released from jail, prevent genocide, and bring war criminals
to justice. [The solidarity expressed by U.S. political and civil
leaders has provided sustenance and hope to human rights defenders in
the grimmest conditions.]{.underline} An Egyptian activist once pulled a
speech given by President Barack Obama on the vital contributions of
civil society out of his pocket and said to me, "When I heard these
words, I knew I wasn't alone."

**[At a moment in which the forces of nationalism, authoritarianism, and
hatred threaten to tear our societies apart again,]{.underline}** **[the
United States needs to make sure that those bravely fighting against
repression and injustice all around the world know that they have not
been forgotten]{.underline}**.

The [countries]{.underline} discussed here **[welcome security
cooperation]{.underline}** [with the United States, which helps them
**address their own security threats**, real or perceived,
and]{.underline} in several cases [probably contributes to the
**government's ability to retain power**. Not surprisingly, **none** of
them relishes]{.underline} the annual criticism in the State
Department's human rights report or ad hoc [**public criticism** from
Washington. On occasion, they]{.underline} deny the charges and [even
**push back**. While human rights-related criticism is an
irritant]{.underline} in each of these countries' relationships with the
U.S., [their governments **understand** why Washington speaks out on
democracy and human rights, even if they question the consistency and
fairness]{.underline} of U.S. criticism when compared with U.S. policy
toward other countries in the world.

Western human rights organizations and advocates have long been critical
of the leaders of all the governments discussed here. They have also
frequently expressed the belief that the U.S. government has not applied
enough pressure to these leaders to improve human rights practices and
democratize faster. Human rights advocates tend to have the most success
when they collectively focus on a particular political prisoner or
narrow issue. But because they have been so critical on a wide range of
issues in the region for so many years, African leaders tend to tune
them out, and even U.S. officials become numbed by the constant refrain.

[China and Russia, by contrast, do not attach political strings to their
assistance, and they eschew criticism of African human rights and
governance practices]{.underline}. [They are also more willing than the
U.S. to transfer **untold quantities of weapons**]{.underline} [to
countries with **questionable records on human rights and governance**.
Even a democracy such as India avoids criticizing egregious human
rights]{.underline} and governance [practices]{.underline} in Africa.
This leaves only the United States, the European Union, Canada, Norway,
Australia and a few others to convey bad news and experience the
repercussions.

Reform: Potentials and Challenges for Conflict Transformation, Berghof

[**Violent crises and internal wars** are]{.underline} often
[consequences of]{.underline} the [failure]{.underline} of states [to
**provide**]{.underline} stability and [**security** for]{.underline}
their [citizens]{.underline}. International organisations and
development agencies became aware that [development and peace processes
**cannot be effective**]{.underline} or take place [in situations of
threat, social disorder and violence. In order to overcome cultures of
violence]{.underline} and to support nation building processes [they
have focused on security sector reform as an **integral part** of
**third party intervention**]{.underline} in recent years. The United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) was the first to argue that "Human
Security" is one of the essentials and thus has widened the concepts of
security. The European Union decided to shift this issue to the centre
of its efforts for civil crisis prevention by emphasizing support for
"the rule of law" and police reforms in conflict regions. And even civil
society actors such as NGOs dedicated to disarmament, development and
peace building have had the experience that initiatives for building
civil society can only be successful if state structures exist which can
assure security for international and local groups working in and on the
conflict. [The conflict transformation community]{.underline} - to whom
the Berghof Handbook is primarily targeted - does not have a
particularly positive attitude towards the security sector. At least [in
the past]{.underline}, members of this community [have seen the military
as part of the problem and therefore to be avoided and
marginalized]{.underline}, rather than as part of the solution to be
engaged with. By and large they tend not to take a serious interest in
security sector issues. It is not hard to see why. Military solutions to
conflict are based on a very different paradigm from conflict
transformation. Most people are interested in peace but there are very
different views on how to get there. In some conflicts the concept of
peace through war is promoted, meaning that peace will be achieved
through military victory over the opposition, whether they be insurgents
or another state. It is the idea that one view must prevail and if one
or more parties are not prepared to use non-violent means then force may
be the only alternative. Conflict Transformation Clem McCartney, Martina
Fischer & Oliver Wils Berghof Handbook Dialog Series 6 on the other hand
is based on trying to reconcile different interests and working with the
different groups in conflict to see how a solution can be found which is
compatible with the interests and needs of all parties. Even when one or
more parties are willing to use force, the transformative approach
believes the parties can be helped to see that an imposed solution is
not helpful in the long run. Is it possible for such different
approaches to complement each other or are they always operating against
each other? Further, people using a conflict transformative approach
will often doubt the good faith of people committed to the military and
military solutions. [Some doubt the security sectors willingness to
change and the capacity to change even if the willingness is there.
Others claim that security sector structures are by their nature
hierarchical and authoritarian]{.underline} and as such antithetical to
values of conflict transformation. If they were to change, the security
structures would loose their effectiveness. [Some would go farther and
point to militarism that they feel is endemic]{.underline} in security
structures and pervasive in states which have a strong military
influence. If **[the security sector is]{.underline}** part of the
problem it has to be recognised that it is also **[part of the
solution]{.underline}**. [The security sector cannot be ignored. It
plays a central role]{.underline} in conflict, [and often security
sector personnel are the **first to realise** that a military solution
will not solve the conflict]{.underline}, though they may not know how
to bring about an agreed solution. [The security sector also has an
important impact on the process of rebuilding society]{.underline}.
Major concerns of people in conflict zones are insecurity and a lack of
confidence in the services that are established to provide security.
Therefore [in order for any solution to the conflict to be effective,
the people in the community need to **feel**]{.underline} personally
**[secure]{.underline}** [and **have confidence** in the security
services]{.underline}. Often that does not happen and the settlement may
collapse. To build that sense of confidence and security will normally
require restructuring of the security service to ensure greater
accountability and openness and, perhaps, the merging of the former
combatants into new structures. What changes are needed in the security
sector to create systems which can play a constructive role in the peace
process and in peace building after and in nation building in general?
If we acknowledge that [officers and staff of the military and security
agencies will find it difficult to introduce and implement such changes
when they themselves have been working and serving within those agencies
for a long time and are imbued with their ethos,]{.underline} then
[others have to be willing to **engage with them and co-operate with
them** in taking the necessary reform measures]{.underline}.
**[Otherwise reform will fail]{.underline}**. This issue of the Berghof
Dialogue Series examines the arguments for engagement with the security
sector and provides an analysis of the dilemmas that arise and
suggestions for how they might be overcome. The lead paper provides an
overview of the current state of knowledge and practice. Herbert Wulf,
the former Director of the Bonn International Center for Conversion
describes the historical development of thinking about the topic,
acknowledging past scepticism in the wider development community but
also noting the reorientation which obliges the wider conflict
resolution and development communities to engage with the issue. He
offers a typology of the different conditions that exist in states that
indicate different capacities and commitment to reform and therefore
suggest that different approaches are needed. He identifies the
motivations for reform and the sources of the impetus for reform and he
indicates the parameters and components of a programme of security
sector reforms. Laurie Nathan and Najib Azca then provide an insight
into experiences in two different regions -- South Africa and Indonesia.
South Africa is often offered as an example of a successful process of
conflict transformation and associated security sector reform and it had
many advantages in terms of resources yet Laurie Nathan, former
Executive Director of the Centre for Conflict 6 Security Sector Reform:
Potentials and Challenges for Conflict Transformation 7 Resolution in
Cape town and currently Visiting Fellow at the Crisis States Programme
at the London School of Economics, shows that there were many problems
and obstacles which had to be overcome and gives some insight into how
they were addressed. He reinforces the point that failure is not always
a sign of lack of political will, though finding a way to reconcile the
different agendas of different groups is a political, not a technical
process. Indonesia is unusual in that the role of the army in society
was uniquely important and systematic under the former Soharto regime,
and it is interesting to look at the approach taken to reform described
in the paper by Najib Azca, from the Centre for Security and Peace
Studies in Yogyakarta. He shows how some had an interest in keeping
conflict going and thereby justifying the need for maintaining a power
based model of social cohesion. In a substantial section of his paper he
relates how the community tensions in parts of Indonesia have worked
against reform in the security sector. Both make the point that, as
Laurie Nathan puts it "the higher the level of instability and violence
in the nation and the region, the less likely will be reforms that have
an anti-militarist orientation." In Najib Azca's words "communal
violence can be perceived as a consequence of the poor performance of
the security sector and, therefore, a symptom of a need for security
sector reform." On the other hand, communal conflict is likely to
handicap the implementation of security sector reform, as is evident in
the case of the communal conflict in Ambon. However, the South African
case underlines the argument that the military may sometimes overcome
militarism while a militarist perspective reliant on force remains
imbued in the wider society. The other three papers by Nicole Ball,
Marina Caparini and Vanessa Farr look at ways of overcoming such
problems and ensuring that appropriate reforms are introduced and that
they are implemented effectively. Nicole Ball, who is Senior Fellow at
the Center for International Policy in Washington and is also associated
with the Center for International Development and Conflict Management at
the University of Maryland, offers her security sector institutional
assessment tool as a way to analyse what kind of reforms are necessary
and feasible. This typology focuses on the context of the security
sector in the state and in this way facilitates the identification of
entry points for reform and indicates the essentially political nature
of SSR, an aspect that Laurie Nathan had also noted. She particularly
notes the poor prospects of reform in authoritarian states. Marina
Caparini, from the Geneva Centre for Democratic Control of Armed Forces
notes that security sector reform is rarely achieved in practice and
argues that it requires a holistic approach with inter-agency
co-operation. However inter-agency rivalry is more often evident. She
also emphasises the importance of civil society involvement while
recognising the lack of expertise within the wider community. She makes
the interesting observation that specialist NGOs often are made up of
ex-military personnel and those close to the military and therefore
"lack critical distance" which allows them to introduce fresh
perspectives. A significant part of her paper deals with the importance
of dealing with SSR within a broader regional perspective. Vanessa Farr,
working with the United Nations Development Programme, takes up the
question of [civil society]{.underline} involvement and in particular
the lack of attention paid to the weakest sections of society. She
reminds us that they [are acutely aware of issues that normally are
overlooked]{.underline} and that it is not sufficient to listen to their
perspectives [but they **need**]{.underline} some [**leverage** to
ensure that their concerns are incorporated into any programme of reform
and that the reform includes ongoing attention to their
concerns]{.underline}. She also points to how groups such as women whose
needs and roles have been ignored have through the use of creative and
striking approaches been able to inform and change the debate about SSR.
Vanessa Farr, in common with the other authors, considers that a
rights-based approach is essential to make a real impact on ensuring
that security sector reforms Berghof Handbook Dialog Series 8 address
the individual's concerns about human security. Some points of
particular interest to those working in conflict transformation are only
referred to briefly by the authors. In particular there is the question
of reform in a post conflict situation and dealing with the legacy of
war, as Nicole Ball mentions. What to do about past abuses of human
rights under the old regime in the context of creating new structures
and systems? Najib Azca refers to the question of immunity for past
abuses of human rights under the old regime. Those implicated may impede
the process of reform unless they are granted immunity. But is that a
satisfactory outcome? There are also the problems associated with
non-formal military units such as paramilitary groups, vigilantes, rebel
fighters and so on. The existence of such groups will often make reform
more difficult but there may also be scope for programmes of disarmament
and demobilisation or integration of some groups into the state security
services. Laurie Nathan touches on the question of how to integrate
ex-combatants in new structures and how to manage potential ethnic
tensions. The authors open up the issues of what needs to happen to
reform or transform the security sector but all are agreed that clarity
is important because, as Nicole Ball puts it, much is done under the
name of SSR which is not, and it may be used to describe programmes to
strengthening military capacities without addressing the way in which
the military operates within the state and in the community. All the
authors agree that this issue is more acute at the present time, because
in the context of major or perceived security challenges compromises are
being made in tolerating abuses of rights and militarisation. They
indicate how the war on terror and global crime are used as a
justification for supporting regimes which abuse human rights and where
the security sector is not open and accountable to democratic control.
As Marina Caparini puts it, Western states are "subordinating human
rights concerns to the requirements of improving military or security
capacities." Herbert Wulf refers to is as "a lack of a coherent response
and double standards". One might also describe it as hypocrisy. This
brings us back to the question of public participation because the real
concerns of the people are lost sight of in this context. Laurie Nathan
acknowledges the "lack of capacity in parliament, judiciary or civil
society to allow oversight" and Vanessa Farr argues that even these
bodies do not speak or understand the positions of the most vulnerable
in society. Military personnel are by and large suspicious of outside
influence especially from those who have not themselves had a career in
the military. It is a vicious cycle because without participation the
militarist culture and discourse will not change and without a change in
the culture it will be hard for the system to hear other voices. In many
ways the global security community is addressing the wrong questions and
looking for answers from the wrong people. Herbert Wulf notes that
"externally brokered and assisted reform has primarily addressed the
warring parties rather than the forces advocating peace" and that there
is a "feeling that security sector reform in a broad sense does not
necessarily address the immediate security needs." The public need some
leverage but unless there is an informed public debate where the
individual can consider what they require from the security sector and
that those concerns have priority, the dominant discourse and culture
will continue to reflect a militarist mind set. [This is where the
conflict transformation community can make an **important input**

McCartney, Martina Fischer and Oliver Wils Security Sector Reform:
Potentials and Challenges for Conflict Transformation 9 1. Security
sector reform as a new paradigm 1.1 Defining security sector reform
Security sector reform1 is a relatively recent concept in state
transformation, development and post-conflict peace-building. Notions of
democratising societies, good governance with transparency and
accountability, peaceful transformation of societies, human security and
poverty reduction programmes have recently made inroads in security
thinking (UNDP 1994; Commission on Human Development 2003; Ball and
Brzoska 2002; Ball et al 2003). People worldwide are concerned about
armed conflict, terrorism, regional conflicts, failed states, violent
crime and human rights abuses. The people-centred concept of human
security ideally complements, but often contrasts or competes with the
notion of state security, or even more narrowly the security of the
political elite. These conceptual changes in the security debate
happened primarily in developing but less so in transitional countries.
Security sector reform addresses security problems and tries to improve
the situation through institutional reforms. Security and peace are seen
as a public good (Mendez 1999). Society as a whole, as well as its
individual members, benefits from an increase in security. Security
sector reform must be understood as a broad concept, which also concerns
a more efficient use of scarce resources to improve security.
Democratic, civilian control over security forces is crucial Herbert
Wulf Security Sector Reform in Developing and Transitional Countries 1
In the official discussions within the OECD donor community the term
security system reform has recently been introduced instead of security
sector reform. Berghof Handbook Dialog Series 10 for the provision of
security in the interests of the population. Democratic decision making
requires transparency and accountability. Thus, the public at large
needs to be involved. However, democratisation is no guarantee of
improved security. The fact that democratisation has so often been
associated with rising political violence is probably no coincidence
since it challenges established privileges and raises political
expectation which are not always fulfilled (Luckham 2003). Hence, the
crux of the reform of the security sector is the development of both
effective civil oversight and creation of institutions capable of
providing security (Ball et. al. 2003, p. 268).2 The list of countries
in need of security sector reform is long.3The reasons why security
sector reform is necessary in each of these countries vary. They include
post-conflict rebuilding, transition from military or one-party rule to
participatory forms of government, recent independence, a lack of
transparency and accountability in public affairs, a disregard for the
rule of law, problem in conflict mediation due to an often
conflict-exacerbating role by actors in the security sector,
difficulties in the management of scarce resources, as well as
inadequate civilian capacity to manage and monitor the security forces.
The concept of security sector reform has become increasingly popular
since it was first put forward to a larger public in a speech by Clare
Short, the then United Kingdom Minister for International Development,
in London in 1998 (Short 1999; Ball 1998.) Its appeal lies in the
visionary integration of a number of objectives under one intellectual
roof: the reduction of military expenditures and their redirection to
development purposes; security-relevant development; donor activities in
conflict prevention and post-conflict situations; and improvement in the
efficiency and effectiveness of governance over those institutions
charged with the provision of security (Brzoska, 2003). Box 1: What is
the security sector and its reform? Security sector reform is the
transformation of the security system which includes all the actors,
their roles, responsibilities and actions, so that it is managed and
operated in a manner that is more consistent with democratic norms and
sound principles of good governance, and thus contributes to a
well-functioning security framework. Responsible and accountable
security forces reduce the risk of conflict, provide security for
citizens and create the right environment for sustainable development.
The overall objective of security sector reform is to contribute to a
secure environment that is conducive to development. Source: DFID 2003,
p. 30, OECD/DAC 2001, pp. II-35 When defining security sector reform and
formulating the objectives, the problem arises that too narrow a
definition (for instance an exclusive focus on the military) might lead
to an inadequate programme. This is because security sector reform is
not just about disarmament or reducing the size of the army, but also
about security in the wider sense -- the security of every single human
being within society. Conversely, too broad a definition (that includes
everything from protection against HIV to water resources management)
might create a lack of clarity concerning the core of the needed
reforms. If adequately designed, the supply of weapons, materials and
other equipment as well as military and police assistance can also be
part of a programme of security sector reform, as the need for the right
equipment by African peace keepers illustrates (Field 2004). [One
criterion for]{.underline} using the term [security sector reform is
that]{.underline} this [assistance is **integrated** into an overall
strategy]{.underline} of 2 See Box 1. 3 Governments in developed
countries have implemented reforms in their security sector too.
However, this paper addresses primarily security sector reforms in
developing and transitional countries. Security Sector Reform:
Potentials and Challenges for Conflict Transformation 11 development and
democratisation of the society. This implies that security sector reform
can never be implemented as a stand-alone programme but has to be
embedded in a general peace-building and development programme. The
military assistance programmes, implemented during the Cold War, which
were essentially ideologically motivated, did not as a rule comply with
the concept of security sector reform in use today, since they aimed
merely to strengthen or modernise the armed forces in question and
consolidate the influence of the donor countries. But they did not seek
to help establish a democratically controlled security sector that would
be conducive to development. Box 2: The historical perspective The
recent debate on security sector reform is not the first period during
which development theoreticians and practitioners had turned their
attention to these themes. Back in the sixties -- partially brought
about by a large number of military coups d'état in Latin America,
Africa and Asia -- the development community was interested in helping
identify an appropriate role for the military and the input of resources
for the military sector. The debate focused on 1. the consumption or
wastage of resources by the military, and the issue addressed in various
UN reports of whether those resources should be employed for other
purposes. 2. the role of the military in nation-building. Development
theoreticians put forward the hypothesis that, in view of the often
artificial borders drawn up in the decolonisation process, the military
might play a role in uniting people and building nations. 3. the role of
the military as a pillar of modernisation. Anglo-Saxon sociologists and
political scientists in particular viewed the military as a key group
for the modernisation and industrialisation of emerging third-world
societies. In so doing they provided the legitimisation for extensive
military assistance programs. What had previously been a predominantly
positive image of the military as modernisers had changed by the late
sixties, if not before, when the predicted rapid development failed to
materialise and the military in many countries had become anything but
pillars of growth and development. The more empirical analyses of the
seventies focused more closely on the causes of coups d'état and the
consequences of policies pursued by military governments. Development
co-operation -- primarily in response to the negative role of the
undemocratic, often repressive and state-terrorist armed forces --
proceeded to keep its distance from these actors. The role of the
military and paramilitary groups and the absorption of resources by them
came to be seen as a highly sensitive area which was too political.
Presently, still existing reservations about security sector reform are
attributable to the fact that development co-operation programs geared
to the security sector have been viewed as support for the military.
This aloofness from the military was problematic in that military
assistance and other forms of co-operation with the armed forces in the
third world was left largely or in most cases exclusively to the armed
forces in the industrialised countries. These activities then took place
in the context of the confrontation between East and West and the
competition between the respective systems, the Southern dimension of
the East-West antagonism. The support provided to third world countries
by the USSR was founded almost exclusively on arms exports, and training
for the armed forces or underground movements. Yet in countries like the
USA and France too, where military assistance was declared as
development co-operation, in purely quantitative terms military
assistance at times dominated development co-operation. The focus was on
military training and the supply of weapons, Berghof Handbook Dialog
Series 12 whilst the issue of what might be the appropriate role of the
military in society in general received little or no attention. In both
the East and the West, rationales were sought to justify this support to
the armed forces, and it took the end of the Cold War to bring themes
involving military and security policy back into the mainstream of
development policy debate. Source: Wulf 2000. 1.2 Elements and actors of
security sector reform Often the reforms are limited and ignore the need
for strengthening civil oversight and professionalising civil society
for this task. The emerging security sector reform paradigm instead is
based on broad principles such as democratic control and accountability,
public participation and transparency, good governance and public
expenditure management. Instead of single issue reforms, a holistic
concept and approach is now called for especially by the donor community
(Hendriskson 1999, Hendrickson and Karkoszka 2002). In many
post-conflict countries of the world (e.g. the conflict zones of West
and Central Africa and in the Balkans), security sector reform has been
donor-driven. Donors have insisted on and assisted in security sector
reform projects and made such programmes a condition of their
post-conflict assistance. In other regions, particularly in many Latin
American countries, as well as in some of the countries in transition in
Europe, the democratisation of civil-military relations was also
included on the national agenda (Diamint 2002, Born, Caparini and Fluri
2002). Box 3: Dimensions of Security sector Reform Political dimension:
civil control Economic dimension: appropriate consumption of resources
Social dimension: guarantee of citizens' physical security Institutional
dimension: professionalisation of actors in the security sector Source:
Brzoska 2000, Wulf 2000. Security sector reform initiatives address four
broad areas (Brzoska 2000, Wulf 2000, pp. 19-23): • The political
dimension: democratic, civilian oversight of the security sector forces.
The core task of reform in this area is good governance, including the
capacity of the civil society (e.g. media, NGOs, researchers, the public
at large) to facilitate debate on security priorities as well as
civilian oversight of the security forces. • The economic dimension: the
allocation of resources. The rational allocation of human, financial and
material resources to the security sector is a precondition for its
efficient functioning. An excessive security apparatus deprives other
policies (e.g. sustainable development) from scarce resources and
creates an inefficient security sector. At the same time, an
under-funded security sector cannot ensure the security of the
population. Reform here includes identifying needs and key objectives,
determining what is affordable, prioritising resource-allocation and
ensuring the efficient and effective use of resources. • The social
dimension: the actual guarantee of the security of the citizens. The
prime task of the security sector and its actors is to guarantee the
internal and external security of the population. Security is not
identical with security of the state provided by the military. Rather,
it includes the security of the population from attacks of all types on
their life, health or property. Security Sector Reform: Potentials and
Challenges for Conflict Transformation 13 • The institutional dimension:
the structure of the security sector and the institutional separation of
the various forces and institutions. The different forces can only be
efficient and be held accountable if the various institutional tasks are
clearly defined. An institutional overlap between domestic public
security and external defence increases the danger of intervention by
the military in domestic affairs. The concept of a security sector
should not become an excuse for militarised police forces or a major
internal role for the armed forces. Box 4: The security community • Core
security institutions: armed forces; police; paramilitary forces; coast
guard; militias, and intelligence services • Security sector oversight
bodies: legislatures and legislative committees; ministries of defence,
internal affairs, justice, foreign affairs; office of the president; and
financial management bodies (ministries of finance, budget offices,
auditor general's offices) • Non-core security institutions: judiciary,
customs, correctional services, and other uniformed bodies •
Non-statutory security force institutions: liberation armies, guerrilla
armies, traditional militias, political party militias, and private
security companies. Source: Ball and Brzoska, 2002, p. 8. 2. Empirical
experiences and preconditions for reform 2.1 Potential for security
sector reform It is very difficult to generalise on the nature and the
required steps of security sector reform, since the respective
political, economic and social conditions, as well as the regional
constellations, need to be taken into account. The context in which the
security sector is to be reformed is vital, and the differences in the
various countries are as critical as their commonalties. Nevertheless,
an attempt will be made here to identify a number of general conditions
and draw corresponding conclusions. A central prerequisite for the
successful implementation of reforms is the will to reform on the part
of various relevant partners in developing countries, although equally
important is the situation in which the specific country finds itself.
The opportunities and potentials for reform in different situations can
be measured on a scale, although categorising these countries on that
scale is somewhat based on subjective judgement. The two poles are
formed by countries at war (such as Sudan), and countries in
postconflict situations (such as Mali, South Africa and possibly Sierra
Leone). It goes without saying that, where war and violent conflicts are
being pursued, there is no broad-based will for reform. On the contrary,
the belligerent parties usually attempt to strengthen their martial
potential in order to defeat the enemy. Reforms to introduce civil
control of the military, the growing influence of civil society or
demobilisation and disarmament cannot be expected in countries at war,
or can be expected only on a limited scale. Nevertheless, this is the
very situation in which civil society is needed as a watchdog or
whistleblower. Plans for later programmes of demobilisation, disarmament
and reintegration can already be drawn up during the conflict.
Corresponding support measures are possible. Given the present
situation, for example in Sudan, there is no basis for security sector
reform. Hence, Sudan could even be placed outside of this continuum.

situation in areas of tension and countries with a high probability of
war. In these countries, there is usually a process of armament followed
by mobilisation of the armed forces, whereupon civil norms cease to
apply. External support is usually accepted by a government only to
support its own war effort. In such cases, however, it is also
conceivable that support be focused on civil society. Here too it is
necessary to seek paths and support structures that strengthen human
security. Poor preconditions for comprehensive security sector reform
also prevail in so-called "failed" or "collapsed" states. Characteristic
of this development is the loss of state control over the monopoly of
force. **[External assistance]{.underline}**, even on a large scale, is
no guarantee for success. In such situations, reforms of the apparatus
of legitimate state coercion are virtually impossible. Somalia is a
prototypical instance of such situations; the fragmentation of the
individual militarily active groups and warlords demonstrates that
groups are only willing to be disarmed under favourable conditions (for
instance where alternative economic prospects are created). However, the
preconditions are not in place for fundamental security sector reform.
Potentials [are]{.underline} more [conducive]{.underline} in countries

legacy, continued authoritarian political leadership, nepotism, police

reform. Often civilian oversight is almost non-existent. [**Security

#### ONLY the counterplan provides effective leverage

to Improve Return on Investment for Security Assistance, August 2017,

Editor's Note: [Making other countries **more effective U.S. security
partners** is a **vital part** of counterterrorism, counterinsurgency
and U.S. foreign policy]{.underline} in general. [Yet it seems to **fail
often**, and support for such aid appears to be]{.underline}
[declining]{.underline}. Part of [the problem may be in **how** the
United States does such assistance]{.underline}. Stephen Tankel of
American University and Melissa Dalton of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies argue that [the United States should **reverse**
its traditional approach]{.underline}. **[Instead of punishing partners
that don\'t live up to their end of the bargain]{.underline}**, **[the
United States should reward those that
do]{.underline}**---**[carrots]{.underline}**, in other words, **[not
sticks.]{.underline}**

\*\*\*

Security assistance is an expensive tool of statecraft, even if it is
just one component of a total foreign aid allotment that represents only
about one percent of the total U.S. budget. In FY 2015, the tab totaled
an estimated \$16.8 billion. Security assistance includes all grant
assistance programs through which [the United States provides defense
articles]{.underline}, military training, and other defense-related
services. The United States uses this assistance [not only
to]{.underline} [build]{.underline} the [capacity]{.underline} of allies
and partners, [but]{.underline} also [to try to shape]{.underline} their
[behavior]{.underline}. Though [this]{.underline} latter effort [often
fails]{.underline}, recipients rarely suffer the consequences.

A rare exception occurred last week. Trump administration sources
acknowledged that the United States plans to withhold up to \$290
million in aid to Egypt over democracy and human rights concerns. This
is likely to prompt renewed debate over whether U.S. security assistance
can be leveraged to promote behaviorial change in a recipient country.
The decision was particularly surprising because President Trump has
exhibited little interest in promoting democracy or human rights
concerns. Yet perhaps it should not have been considering that he is
skeptical about helping other countries deal with "their problems,"
especially given the costs involved. Many Americans appear to share his
skepticism.

The critics have a point. The reality is, the U.S. government has few
mechanisms to reliably track how its security assistance dollars are
performing in terms of return on investment for meeting strategic and
policy goals. There have been a number of steps taken in the last three
years to start to change that, through executive and legislative branch
action. However, even the most ardent supporters of alliances and
partnerships must acknowledge that [the return]{.underline} on security
assistance [is]{.underline} often [lower than it could be]{.underline}.
More than merely wasting taxpayers' dollars, [this **damages U.S.
credibility** and **reinforces the belief**]{.underline} [that
maintaining **alliances**]{.underline} [and partnerships is simply **not
worth the costs**]{.underline} involved.

We firmly believe [security assistance should remain a **critical
pillar** of U.S. statecraft]{.underline}. [We also believe the United
States could get a **better rate of return** on some of these programs
by **changing the way it conditions assistance.**]{.underline}
[**Changing** the way the United States **conditions** assistance could
change that for the better]{.underline}. This will not solve the problem
of how to optimize our relationships with other countries---there is no
silver bullet for that---but it would help the United States get more
bang for its buck. This is a sentiment that should appeal to the
dealmaker-in-chief.

The Swiss Army Knife of Statecraft

Security assistance objectives can be grouped into two buckets:

The first set of objectives falls under the umbrella of [building
partner capacity]{.underline}, which has become a catchall for a wide
array of programs. This set of objectives [includes
building]{.underline} the [capacity]{.underline} and capabilities [of
recipients to operate independently against shared threats]{.underline};
[buttressing the military strength of friendly countries to positively
influence the **balance of power**]{.underline} [and provide
**deterrence and assurance in a given region**]{.underline}; [supporting
coalition partners that assist the United States in an ongoing conflict;
promoting **interoperability**]{.underline} [to enable joint military
missions]{.underline}; [reducing **internal instability**]{.underline}
[and promoting governance and rule of law]{.underline} in countries
[where threats to the United States could manifest; and
**professionalizing** partner forces]{.underline}.

**[Wielding influence]{.underline}** [and **securing**]{.underline}
tactical [**cooperation** is the second. This may translate
into]{.underline} trading assistance for **[access to
bases]{.underline}**, [airspace, or other transit routes]{.underline}.
[The United States sometimes uses assistance to incentivize short-term
tactical cooperation against shared threats. In other cases, assistance
is intended to **reassure allies and partners**]{.underline} [of
America's commitment to its security]{.underline}, [either in general or
against common enemies]{.underline}. Here it is worth noting that
**[plans to]{.underline}** slash the State Department's budget and
[**cut** foreign assistance]{.underline} **[compound concerns about U.S.
abandonment]{.underline}** [and further]{.underline} **[reduce American
influence]{.underline}**. [Finally, the United States has **tried, often
without success, to use assistance as a lever**]{.underline} [to **shape
a recipient's behavior**]{.underline} [either domestically or
internationally.]{.underline}

[As a result of competing priorities, the United States often chooses
not to condition assistance \... or attempts to do so in an **ad hoc
manner**]{.underline}.

Some U.S. objectives overlap with one another. Others conflict. And lest
we forget, our partners also get a vote. American objectives for
security assistance often do not align with theirs, due in large part to
differences in how the United States and a recipient prioritize and
perceive threats. The number of different objectives at play complicates
efforts to condition assistance; enforcing conditions to achieve one set
of objectives could hamper efforts to achieve another set. For example,
after the Bahraini government's security forces launched a major
crackdown on protesters during the Arab uprisings, the United States
temporarily restricted arms sales to the country. Some members of the
Obama administration also argued for placing conditions on security
assistance. Others worried that this would undermine Bahrain's support
for U.S. basing and access, which is important for Afghanistan, Iran
deterrence, and counterterrorism operations. As a result of competing
priorities, the United States often chooses not to condition assistance,
as was the case with Bahrain, or attempts to do so in an ad hoc manner.
Worst of all, the United States sometimes imposes conditions, but then
blinks first and backs down when they are not met.

Playing Chicken with Assistance

[Any conversation about conditioning assistance should **begin** with
**what fails to work and why**]{.underline}. [**Failed** efforts to
change a recipient's behavior by conditioning assistance]{.underline}
often [share]{.underline} one or more [characteristics. First, these
efforts are almost always **unilateral**]{.underline}, [meaning the
United States **imposes conditions** **without negotiating with the
recipient in advance**]{.underline}. [Conditions are also sometimes
**retroactive**, which is to say they are placed on **already existing
aid packages**]{.underline}, [which the recipient may view as an
**entitlement**]{.underline}. [This has been the case with
Egypt.]{.underline}

Although Congress appropriates and authorizes this assistance every
year, the United States has traditionally provided foreign assistance to
both Egypt and Israel since the 1979 peace treaty to smooth security
cooperation and maintain a balance of power between the two countries.
Egypt has received \$1.3 billion in military assistance per year since
1987. Following Egypt's waves of authoritarian crackdowns in 2013, the
Obama administration temporarily froze F-16 aircraft deliveries and
other equipment to the Egyptian military. It lifted the hold two years
later following improved relations with Egypt's President Abdel Fattah
el-Sisi and amid growing concerns about jihadist insurgency there. Some
U.S. lawmakers objected to the decision to lift the holds, pointing out
that Egypt had failed to follow through on governance reforms. The
administration's decision to lift the holds also may have been an
acknowledgement that they were not effectively changing Egyptian
government behavior. In parallel, the U.S. administration also began to
restructure U.S. assistance for Egypt to focus more on counterterrorism,
deemphasizing large conventional arms sales that had historically been a
feature of the relationship. Throughout this period, Egypt viewed these
restrictions as an affront to its decades-long assistance relationship
with the United States. Notably, Egypt and Israel are two of the few
countries that would not see its foreign military financing (FMF) shrink
in the Trump administration.

The Trump administration has reportedly expressed concerns over Egypt's
implementation of a law restricting the activities of NGOs to
development and social work, as a way for the Egyptian government to
further constrict popular dissent and civil society. As a result, the
U.S. administration is reprogramming \$65.7 million in FY 2017 FMF (as
well as \$30 million in FY 2016 Economic Support Funds) and withholding
\$195 million in FY 2016 FMF, the latter pending Egyptian improvement on
its human rights and democracy record. Egypt's view that it is entitlted
to its annual FMF appropriation, along with the importance of the
U.S.-Egyptian security cooperation relationship, will likely obstruct
meaningful changes in Egyptian government behavior with respect to
democracy and human rights.

[Arms sales are useful]{.underline} tools [for maintaining
communication, strengthening relationships, and keeping]{.underline}
potential [adversary states at bay.]{.underline} Conversely, [as a blunt
instrument of coercion (i.e. if you do not do X, we will suspend Y),
they are]{.underline} likely [losers. Senior U.S. government officials
involved in the arms transfer process that I interviewed]{.underline}
[over the past year during the course of my research have echoed similar
sentiments. This is also borne out by previous research providing
evidence that using arms transfers]{.underline} [as situationally
coercive tools is rarely successful]{.underline}. [Interestingly,
coercion attempts using arms transfers are least likely to be successful
when used as a punishment or threat against an autocratic regime, such
as Saudi]{.underline} Arabia. [Instead, punishments in the form of an
embargo]{.underline} can [often push a client to diversify sourcing
rather than to change behavior.]{.underline}

Consider Indonesia and Egypt. [In 2015, Egypt agreed to
purchase]{.underline} nearly [50 Russian]{.underline}
[MiG]{.underline}-29M/M2[s]{.underline} [and more than two-dozen French
Rafales.]{.underline} This represented [a shocking turn of events
after]{.underline} more than [three decades of purchasing only
American-made fighter jets. It was]{.underline} also [driven largely by
the U.S. embargo]{.underline} put in place in [2013, after
the]{.underline} [Egyptian army's removal of]{.underline}
then-[President]{.underline} Mohamed [Morsi]{.underline}, who had won
the presidency in a 2012 election. [The embargo caused significant
tension between the two states driven by "an Egyptian sense that they
were at a point of mortal peril" while the United States was moralizing
about]{.underline} democratic [reforms]{.underline}. Remarkably, the
United States lifted the embargo in 2015 with virtually no change in
Egyptian policies, no official U.S. "democracy certification", and
Egyptian military support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. [The U.S. arms
embargo as a tool of coercive change was an abject failure.]{.underline}

[A similar story played out in Indonesia more than a decade prior. A

Russia with the specific intent to "overcome the effects of \[U.S.\]

United States lifted the embargo in 2005]{.underline}. Perhaps most
remarkably, even after the United States agreed to give Indonesia 24
F-16s in 2012, the archipelago state still agreed to purchase 11 Russian
Su-35s. The U.S. attempt at coercion not only failed but continues to
perpetuate negative strategic effects today.

Challenging a longtime U.S. military critique of security assistance,
some [defense experts are saying **suspending**]{.underline} U.S.
**[military aid]{.underline}** to foreign security forces [because of
their poor human rights record has often **caused**]{.underline} an
[**improvement in the force's behavior**.]{.underline} This point, which
was raised at a House Armed Services Committee hearing in October,
appears to contradict military views that suspending aid for such
reasons is counterproductive.

[For years, U.S. defense experts have seen]{.underline} **[cutting
off]{.underline}** U.S. military [aid to certain repressive foreign
security forces as ineffective because it]{.underline}
**[harms]{.underline}** U.S. **[national security]{.underline}**

record**]{.underline}. At a meeting in Nigeria this year, former U.S.
Defense Secretary Robert Gates indicated that U.S. [**requirements to
suspend** military aid to abusive forces in Nigeria have **frustrated
efforts to address terrorism**]{.underline}.

Commenting on restricting military aid to Nigeria, [U.S. Vice Admiral
Charles Leidig said "the conundrum it presents us is that the nations
whose militaries have had human rights violations]{.underline} perhaps
[are the ones that **need U.S. engagement the most**]{.underline}."
Other [U.S. officials have pointed to instances in which human rights
training helped]{.underline}. After [**providing military training to
professionalize**]{.underline} Croatian [security forces with a poor
human rights record]{.underline} in the mid-1990s, for instance, U.S.
military personnel claimed the training [helped improve their
actions]{.underline} after a new government took power.

Nigeria Security Assistance

According to a RAND Corporation study, however, suspending military aid
for human rights or other reasons does "not have the devastating
consequences" that opponents might expect. The study highlights that,
[in some cases, U.S. punitive funding cuts of military aid have improved
foreign partner behavior. Out of ten cases of punitive]{.underline}
funding [cuts]{.underline} the study examined [over the past 20
years]{.underline}, it determined that [three "resulted in]{.underline}
significant [improvement]{.underline}."

The study did not disclose the names of the countries they reviewed.
Research does point to [Indonesia]{.underline} in the early 2000s as a
potential example of when [suspension of security assistance resulted
in]{.underline} an [improvement of military force behavior]{.underline}.
In 1999, the U.S. suspended all aid to the Indonesian armed forces, due
to reports of gross human rights abuses in East Timor, Aceh, and other
regions. Following this suspension, and after the resignation of
President Suhatro, basic freedoms in the country proceeded to expand
rapidly, [contributing "to a vibrant]{.underline} if chaotic
[democracy]{.underline}."

The [suspension of]{.underline} military [aid to Egypt is likely an
example of when funding cuts **didn't** result in improved human rights
behavior,]{.underline} perhaps [because of the **way in which the United
States went about it**]{.underline}. After the July 2013 military coup,
President Obama didn't formally suspend a portion of U.S. military aid
until several months later. This delay was explained by many as an
attempt to maintain good relations with the new government while also
slowly prodding it towards democratization. It was also relatively clear
that the suspension would only be temporary, [**undercutting the real
threat** of cutting the funding]{.underline}.

[The RAND study]{.underline} [also found that when the United States
**cuts military aid** to foreign security force, their military
capabilities are **negatively affected**]{.underline}. However, it
indicated that the blow to a state's security capacity is perhaps less
damaging than previously thought, for two possible reasons. Firstly, in
some cases, it takes time for a government to lose military capability,
as donated equipment and weapons can remain fully functional for
decades. Secondly, the United States does not always cuts all types of
aid to a foreign force.

For instance, some military aid to Nigeria was cut in 2014 on account of
Nigeria's abysmal human rights record and rampant corruption. Yet, the
Obama Administration still allocated \$4.4 million in security
assistance to Nigerian forces in FY 2015. This was even before Nigerians
elected a new President, Muhammadu Buhari, who pledged investigations
into military abuses and a reform of the Nigeria security sector.

Human rights groups have also fired back at officials who argue that the
United States must sometimes assist repressive security forces in order
to address terrorism. Advocates have cited that Nigerian security force
abuses against civilians have unintentionally aided Boko Haram's cause
and recruitment efforts. By supporting such forces, U.S. security
assistance to Nigeria can in fact prove counterproductive to fighting
terrorism.

[As the RAND Corporation is a widely respected voice in defense
analysis, this new study may signal a new openness within the defense
community for suspending military aid because of concerns for human
rights violations]{.underline}. The findings could also support those
within Congress and the Obama Administration who are pushing to maintain
the Leahy Law, which restricts U.S. military aid to specific units on
the basis of credible evidence of gross human rights violations, in its
current form.

Without more details about the ten cases reviewed in the RAND study,
however, it's difficult to study why [aid **conditioning** worked in
**some** countries and **not others**. There is]{.underline} also
[**reporting** that **using a Millennium Challenge Corporation
method**]{.underline} [of requiring countries to **meet certain
standards** **before** receiving aid is a **more effective
approach**]{.underline}. More investigations would also be helpful to
determining when and in what form it makes sense for the United States
to furnish human rights training to repressive forces.

Given the large number of U.S. forces deployed around the world and the
casualties sustained in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is easy to miss that
the Services do much more than engage in combat. On any given day,
military engineers dig wells in East Africa, medical personnel provide
vaccinations in Latin America, and special operations forces (SOF)
mentor militaries in Southeast Asia. Through these activities, [the
U]{.underline}nited [States]{.underline} [seeks to improve its
international image, strengthen the state]{.underline} sovereignty
[system by training and equipping security forces, **preempt localized
violence from escalating into regional crises**, and protect national
security by addressing underlying conditions that inspire and sustain
violent extremism]{.underline}. Far from preparation for major war,
[these activities rely on a unique blend of charitable American
political culture, latent civil-military capacity within
the]{.underline} Department of Defense ([DOD]{.underline}), [and
ambitious military of!cers who see the strategic landscape characterized
by weak states and nonstate actors]{.underline}. In short, the new
strategic assumption sees U.S. security as inextricably bound to the
security of every country in the world. To be effective in this
environment, a new cooperative strategic approach is replacing
traditional notions of national defense, which is based on security
assistance. The implications of this are profound; what was once the
province of SOF is now a core capability for conventional forces. While
this article does not directly address operations in Iraq or
Afghanistan, important lessons are emerging from those conflicts that
are reshaping the military outside of counterinsurgency operations.
First is the impact of intervention itself; forced democratization tends
to produce semidemocratic governments with political instability and
internal conflict.1 Second, to bring stability to postconflict zones
requires new ways of using military forces. For example, General Barry
McCaffrey, USA (Ret.), noted that success in Afghanistan would be
achieved when there are Afghan police units in every district, a greatly
expanded Afghan National Army, and significant agricultural reform.2
Finally, [combat operations have taught the military that lethality
cannot solve security problems]{.underline}. [Instead]{.underline},
**[training and equipping indigenous forces to protect and control their
territory are essential for long-term stability]{.underline}**. These
lessons have gained traction and have been extended to weak states in
more permissive environments. Paul Collier argues that [the role for
advanced militaries of the world is "to supply the global public good of
peace in territories that otherwise have the potential for
nightmare]{.underline}."3 Implicit in Collier's assertion is the
importance of weak states to international security. Priority of Weak
States At least since the early 1990s, [state failure has been
identified as a risk to international peace and security]{.underline}.
In spite of objections to nationbuilding by the military, this view
continued throughout the 2000s, when policymakers saw a direct
connection between weak states and international terrorism. For
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates: The recent past vividly demonstrated
the consequences of failing to address adequately the dangers posed by
insurgencies and failing states. Terrorist networks can find sanctuary
within the borders of a weak nation and strength within the chaos of
social breakdown. The most likely catastrophic threats to the U.S.
homeland, for example, that of a U.S. city being poisoned or reduced to
rubble by a terrorist attack, are more likely to emanate from failing
states than from aggressor states.4 This assessment moved formerly
subnational or regional crises to the international level, where it was
assumed that [failed states]{.underline} or states at risk [pose an
acute danger to national security. It produced external intervention
into weak states]{.underline} in the name of human security (for
example, the United States and Philippines, United Kingdom and Sierra
Leone, France and Ivory Coast, or Australia and East Timor). And it
expanded the number of recipients of security assistance. Prioritizing
weak or failing states represents a profound shift in strategic
thinking. Historically, countering the Soviet Union or promoting
economic interests drove U.S. foreign policy decisions and military
deployments. Yet since the 1990s, weak states have captured the
attention of the world, which struggles with bringing stability to
countries such as Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, and Somalia.
At a time when populations are less vulnerable to nuclear annihilation
or traditional war, transnational forces have instilled a pervasive
sense of insecurity. Consequently, it is important for the United States
to understand what threatens friends, adversaries, and those countries
in between. With few exceptions, the United States willingly forms
security assistance agreements with almost every country in the world
and supports those governments through security cooperation. Security
Cooperation As DOD civil-military capabilities (for instance, the Navy's
16,000 Seabees) are used around the world, conventional forces are
assisting partners through security cooperation. Formally, security
cooperation is: the ability for DOD to interact with foreign defense
establishments to build defense relationships that promote specific U.S.
security interests, develop allied and friendly military capabilities
for selfdefense and coalition operations, including allied
transformation, improve information exchange and intelligence sharing to
help harmonize views on security challenges, and provide U.S. forces
with peacetime and contingency access and en route infrastructure.5
Security cooperation falls under the purview of the overall geographic
combatant commander, but his strategy and activities are executed at the
country level through his security assistance officer, who is a member
of the Country Team working for the U.S. Ambassador. Too easily
forgotten, the Department of State is the lead foreign policy
organization in the United States and plays a critical role in security
assistance through the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, which is a
direct link to DOD. With a broad mandate in international security
affairs, active cooperation with DOD is required. If done well, security
assistance activities are coordinated with other interagency activities
beginning at the national level where both the State Department and the
Office of the Secretary of Defense derive priorities and guidance from
the National Security Strategy, which in turn drives the military's
theater campaign plans and Embassies' mission strategic plans. Since
programs always take place in particular countries, Ambassadors are at
the forefront of security assistance. Under National Security Decision
Directive 38, the U.S. Ambassador has absolute authority over all U.S.
personnel and operations within a country, which means that all military
programs are subject to ambassadorial approval and are critical to
promoting U.S. objectives in a particular country.6 The overall goals of
security assistance include creating favorable military balances of
power (for example, selling weapons and training to Saudi Arabia to
balance Iran), advancing areas of mutual defense or security
arrangements (collaborating with Japan on missile defense technology),
building allied and friendly military capabilities for selfdefense
(providing equipment and funding to Israel), supporting multinational
operations (training and equipping the Georgian military, which was the
third largest troop contributor in Iraq in 2008), and preventing crisis
and conflict (facilitating Colombia's success against a decades-old
insurgency). As noted in doctrine, there are six categories of security
cooperation activity: !! military contacts, including senior official
visits, counterpart visits, conferences, staff talks, and personnel and
unit exchange programs !! nation assistance, including foreign internal
defense, security assistance programs, and planned humanitarian and
civic assistance activities !! multinational training !! multinational
exercises !! multinational education !! arms control and treaty
monitoring activities.7 Underlying all of these activities is the clear
intent to achieve U.S. national security objectives. It is important to
remember that states must manage both the risks of abandonment and
entrapment by their friends and allies.8 The United States does this by
building a partner country's military and developing professional
relationships across militaries. These activities are increasingly
enshrined in doctrine and are defined as "the ability to improve the
military capabilities of our allies and partners to help them transform
and optimize their forces to provide regional security, disaster
preparedness and niche capabilities in a coalition."9 For example,
Commander U.S. Naval Forces Europe (CNE) has been developing a
capability for maritime domain awareness throughout Europe and Africa.
CNE has been working with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
Allies and African partners to develop a regional capability to protect
trade, natural resources, and economic development. This includes
establishing maritime domain awareness through the automated
identification system, an array of coastal radar systems, and improved
command and control of a naval reaction force. Inherent in these
activities is developing enduring relationships. In the Near East, for
example, long-term relationships have produced trust and access for the
United States to have forward operating bases in Qatar, Kuwait, United
Arab Emirates, and Bahrain. Additionally, weapons are prepositioned in
other countries, to include Oman. While partners benefit from these
programs, such initiatives also support broader U.S. foreign policy
objectives of global influence. [Security cooperation]{.underline} also
[includes security sector reform]{.underline}, [which is an area of
increasing importance. It focuses on improving civilmilitary relations,
promoting collaboration among regional partners, and fostering
cooperation within partners' governments]{.underline}. **[The United
States has learned that contemporary security challenges]{.underline}**
often **[require whole-ofgovernment solutions and regional
cooperation]{.underline}**. Consequently, **[it seeks to foster this
same approach around the world]{.underline}**. Programs support
legislative reform (for example, seizing assets from drug traffickers in
Colombia), enhancing cooperation between police and defense forces
(building bridges among bureaucratic rivals in Jamaica), and managing
the legacy of past human rights abuses by militaries (integrating human
rights training in programs in Latin America and Africa). Furthermore,
it considers the internal health and welfare of partners' military
forces by combating HIV/AIDS in militaries, promoting noncommissioned
officer development, and providing educational opportunities for
officers. The legislative authorities for these programs primarily
reside in the Department of State, but DOD has the capacity and
expertise to implement military assistance programs. Financed under
Title 22 (Account 150), the international assistance budget was \$27.4
billion in fiscal year (FY) 2009 (see table 110). Fifteen different
programs are included in Account 150, but only six can be considered
security related: foreign military financing (FMF), International
Military Education and Training (IMET), international narcotics control
and law enforcement, peacekeeping operations, Andean Counterdrug
Program, and nonproliferation, antiterrorism, demining, and related
programs. While security assistance programs are substantial,
nonsecurity assistance programs exceed them by at least two to one.
There are considerable differences across regions as well. In Africa,
for example, nonsecurity programs are the dominant approach to
international assistance. In the Near East, however, the opposite is
true. Though the United States has security assistance programs with
over 150 countries, it does privilege several (see table 2).
Historically, Israel has been the largest recipient of security
assistance, and its neighbor Egypt benefited from its recognition of
Israel and its control of the Suez Canal. Given its proximity to the
United States and challenges with drug trafficking organizations, Mexico
has recently emerged as a top recipient of security assistance. Given
the history of American military interventions in Mexico, this has
required new efforts to build trust to reassure the government that
Washington seeks to strengthen and not undermine it. One reason the
United States focuses assistance on just a few countries is to promote
particular countries as regional leaders. In practice, this means that
Jordan hosts an international SOF exercise, peace operations training
center, and an international police training center. Or in Latin
America, Colombia provides helicopter training for regional militaries
and El Salvador hosts a regional peacekeeping institute attracting
military personnel from countries throughout the Western Hemisphere.
**[This approach not only strengthens key partners, but it also reduces
the need for American presence and the negative attention it sometimes
generates]{.underline}**. Over the past five decades, [security
assistance has evolved from a program designed to buy influence and
access to one that is now intended to build capacity meant to obviate
U.S. military presence]{.underline}. Recipients are expected to
"graduate" from assistance and become capable of filling national and
regional security deficits. Engagement Tools In total, security
assistance comprises about 27 percent of normal international
assistance, which is implemented by a variety of governmental and
nongovernmental actors. (Excluded from "normal assistance" are those
activities funded by supplemental budgets that largely benefit Iraq and
Afghanistan.) From the DOD perspective, combatant commanders have a
broad array of security ￼assistance tools at their disposal. For its
part of the 150 Account, security assistance often takes the form of
IMET and FMF. Additionally, DOD directly funds security assistance
through Section 1206/7 and other command funds, but this only makes up
about \$1 billion annually, which is less than 15 percent of security
assistance funded by the State Department. Thus, State exerts
considerable control of programs at both budgetary and implementation
levels. IMET Program Created by the International Security Assistance
and Arms Export Control Act of 1976, Congress intended for IMET to
accomplish three principal goals: to foster increased understanding
between the United States and foreign countries in order to enhance
international peace and security, to help participating countries to
become more self-reliant by improving their ability to utilize defense
resources obtained through FMF, and to increase the awareness of
internationally recognized human rights issues.11 Thirty years later,
the objectives of the program remain fundamentally unchanged. Through
the IMET programs, combatant commands train about 8,000 international
military officers from 125 countries a year. By comparison, the
Fulbright program awards grants to about 4,000 international
participants per year.12 When other programs are included, DOD reaches
an international audience of at least 55,000 annually.13 Programs
include English-language training at the Defense Language Institute,
training activities such as the basic infantry officer's course, and
attendance at U.S. professional military education institutions such as
the Naval War College. Regarding the last, attendance by officers from
other countries is increasing, with foreign officers currently composing
about 15 percent of the graduating class, and it is a priority to
increase international participation in U.S. schools. ￼While the
training and education are often well received, that is difficult to
measure. One major impact of IMET programs is building personal and
professional relationships with people likely to rise to senior levels
within their countries. In Botswana, for example, 11 of 14 serving
general officers are graduates of IMET programs. Moreover, having a core
group of well-trained, professional leaders with first-hand knowledge of
the United States contributes to the professionalization of armed
forces, winning access and influence for diplomatic and military
representatives. As a testament to the quality of selections for the
Naval War College's Naval Staff College, for example, 236 participants
have attained flag rank, 102 later served as chiefs of service, 5 became
cabinet ministers, and 1 became his nation's president.14 Thus, in
theory, the United States is training and educating its partners to
facilitate future collaboration. In FY00, IMET programs were budgeted at
\$49.8 million, which nearly doubled to \$90.5 million by the end of the
Bush years in FY09. As table 3 shows, countries in Europe and Eurasia
received the most funding, while Pacific and East Asian countries
received the least. Underlying the preference for training and educating
military personnel from Europe and Eurasia is NATO integration. Since
NATO expanded from 16 countries in 1999 to 28 countries in 2009, it was
essential for the United States to train its new allies to facilitate
the integration process. This also ensures that European officers
network with other NATO officers. Much as U.S. officers interact with
officers from Estonia, IMET affords opportunities for Estonian officers
to interact with Spaniards. Taken by region, IMET has global impact. In
Africa, every country but Somalia and Zimbabwe received some type of
IMET assistance in 2009. Although it is a relatively modest program in
terms of cost, both the President and Congress attach considerable
importance to the IMET program. Recipient countries are likewise heavily
reliant on these grants. In many cases, the Total dollar value of
defense articles and defense services purchased with cash, credit, and
military assistance program merger funds by a foreign government or
international organization in any fiscal year. program serves as the
only method by which partner militaries receive advanced training from
their U.S. counterparts. Without opportunities from countries such as
the United States, there is little indigenous capacity to
professionalize militaries through military colleges and training
programs. To foster independence and sustainability of these programs,
the United States also helps many countries develop their own
professional military education networks and educational programs
through exchanging faculty, sharing curriculum ideas, and providing
books and professional journals. FMF Program Augmenting military
education and training is foreign military financing, which supplies
grants and loans to finance purchases of American weapons and military
equipment. The State Department oversees the program, but DOD manages it
on a day-to-day basis. In FY09, the FMF budget was the largest program
in the State Department's international assistance account, consuming
over \$4.8 billion (see table 4).15 Countries in the Near East are the
top recipients, while countries in Africa receive the least amount of
U.S. weaponry and equipment. Because of the high cost of U.S. weapons
and different needs by region, FMF is unevenly distributed. By country,
nearly 80 percent of FMF goes to Israel (\$2.55 billion) and Egypt
(\$1.3 billion). Of the remaining 20 percent, just a few countries
receive substantial assistance: Pakistan (\$300 million), Jordan (\$235
million), and Colombia (\$66 million). Seventy countries share the
remaining \$300 million. Of note, only 9 countries in Africa received
FMF in 2009 compared to 45 African countries that received IMET. This
suggests a deliberate policy to focus on professionalizing militaries
instead of arming them, which is a contrast from the past. (Through its
1206 funding, however, DOD is providing weapons for countries in
Africa.) In contrast to Africa, nearly every country in Europe and
Eurasia receives FMF. The top recipients are Poland (\$27 million),
Romania (\$15 million), Turkey (\$12 million), Georgia (\$11 million),
and Bulgaria (\$9 million). In fact, Poland receives more than twice the
amount of all the countries in sub-Saharan Africa combined. NATO
integration and U.S. missile defense programs largely explain this. A
program such as FMF advances U.S. interests in many ways. When countries
buy U.S. military equipment through FMF (and direct commercial sales),
the basis for a relationship is formed. There are typically secure
long-term commitments for training on how to maintain and operate the
equipment. As table 5 illustrates, the top recipients are long-time U.S.
allies and partners to include Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Israel. The
relationships are sustained through military sales using FMF and direct
commercial sales. Additionally, providing spare and replacement parts
ensures competitor countries do not interfere with the relationship.
Finally, combined exercises build personal bonds between U.S. and
partner countries' personnel. 36 \| FEATURES PRISM 1, no. 3 Global
Peacekeeping Operations Initiative Outside of IMET and FMF, the
Department of State operates integrated security assistance programs
such as the Global Peacekeeping Operations Initiative (GPOI). The
precursor programs to GPOI were created to respond to the demand for
peacekeepers in Africa, which increased during the 1990s. With a
shortage of peacekeepers, the United Nations (UN) Security Council found
it difficult to separate former warring parties or deploy as a buffer to
prevent the outbreak of war. The demand for trained peacekeepers rose
from 10,000 in the 1980s to nearly 100,000 by early 2007 and is expected
to grow by at least 50,000 in the coming years. Though the United States
does not provide troops for peacekeeping missions, it is responsible for
about 25 percent of the UN peacekeeping budget and has many bilateral
programs to train, equip, and deploy peacekeepers. In FY09, these
efforts were valued at \$395 million. In 2010, the peacekeeping program
focuses on supporting African Union operations in Somalia, transforming
the Sudanese People's Liberation Army into a conventional military
force, and supporting militaries in Liberia, the Trans-Sahara, and East
Africa. While substantial, General William Ward, commander of U.S.
Africa Command, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee
that "the equipment needs of troop contributing countries for peace
support operations in Darfur and other anticipated operations dwarfs
GPOI's ability to provide the magnitude of equipment required to satisfy
United Nations Contingent Owned Equipment requirements."16 GPOI now
includes 51 partner countries and organizations throughout the world,
although the emphasis is still on Africa (see table 6).17 With increased
capacity gained through GPOI, Africa's military contribution to UN
peacekeeping doubled from 2000 to 2004.18 While the number of available
African peacekeepers has increased, current efforts fall short of the
goal of Africans providing for African security. Of the seven UN
peacekeeping missions in Africa in 2009, only the hybrid UN--African
Union mission in Darfur is composed of an African majority. Non-Africans
primarily compose the other six UN operations. In addition to the
shortfall on UN missions, there are open billets on African Union
peacekeeping missions as well. In sum, there is a shortage of at least
45,000 African peacekeepers for meeting the African Union objective of
Africans providing for their own security. Given standard deployment
cycles, the number can be multiplied by three to account for forces that
are training to deploy, are deployed, and are recovering from
deployment. Initially, the GPOI training was conducted by the U.S.
military, but demand for military personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan
largely shifted responsibility to government contractors. Yet a major
goal is to reduce dependency ￼PRISM 1, no. 3 FEATURES \| 37 on external

When the program concludes, it will be critical to see how well partners
sustain momentum and participate in peacekeeping operations. Game
Changer? 1206 Funding Created during the Cold War, IMET and FMF are
long-term programs and are slow to respond to changes in the security
environment. Thus, when the United States wanted to help Kosovo
formalize its military structures or Afghanistan build an army, it could
not proceed under traditional foreign assistance programs. On average,
it takes 3 to 4 years from concept to execution. In an effort to
overcome lengthy program delays, Congress granted DOD "global train and
equip" authority under Section 1206 of the 2006 National Defense
Authorization Act.19 This was a departure from vesting security
assistance authorities in the Department of State and led to charges of
a militarized foreign policy. The law provides funds to build the
capacity of partners' military forces. This is used primarily for
counterterrorism, but also gives the military unprecedented levels of
discretion and streamlines project development. For example, many
countries received assistance to upgrade their maritime surveillance
capabilities, obtain new patrol craft, and improve communications
systems. In terms of fiscal scope, the train and equip program is
limited to \$350 million annually, but it has taken 4 years for it to
develop at this level, partly due to an expansive definition of
counterterrorism. Out of the approximately \$1 billion expended over
that period, the greatest beneficiaries of 1206 funding are Pakistan
(\$210 million), Lebanon (\$107 million), Yemen (\$98 million),
Indonesia (\$57.5 million), and Bahrain (\$50.4 million). In addition to
1206 funding, DOD gained authority to support stability operations in
U.S.led coalitions under Section 1207. Congress limited this assistance
to a country's military forces (excluding police forces) and stipulated
that no nation should receive assistance if otherwise prohibited from
receiving foreign military assistance through other sources.20 This
caveat was included to ensure that DOD did not undermine State. As DOD
has gained legislative authority to execute security assistance
programs, oversight has been a key concern. To ensure that foreign
policy was not being militarized, the 2007 National Defense
Authorization Act delegated approval authority for Section 1206 spending
from the President to the Secretary of Defense, but stipulated the
Secretary of State must concur for the approval of all programs.21 To be
sure, 1206/1207 are expedient authorities for military commanders to
fund programs, but they are not without oversight. The law requires that
any services, defense articles, or funds provided or transferred to the
Secretary of State comply with the authorities and limitations of the
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the Arms Export Control Act, or any law
making appropriations to carry out such acts. Furthermore, the Secretary
of Defense must notify congressional committees when the authority is
exercised, and the notification must be prepared in coordination with
the Secretary of State.22 At the time the change in law occurred,
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice stated, "In 1206, we have provided a
dual key approach of delivering resources for emergent short-term
military assistance needs 38 \| FEATURES PRISM 1, no. 3 and
counterterrorism activities."23 Finally, all military personnel entering
a country to conduct security assistance programs must be granted
country clearance by the U.S. Embassy there. With few exceptions, U.S.
Ambassadors approve and are well aware of security assistance programs
occurring in their countries. With that said, there are limits to
oversight. For example, Chad received \$6 million to establish a light
infantry rapid reaction force in FY07.24 But in the same year, the
Department of State criticized Chad's security forces for "engaging in
extrajudicial killing, torture, beatings, rapes and human rights
abuses."25 When investigated, it appeared that U.S. European Command
(USEUCOM) did not brief Embassy personnel until after the proposal
received 1206 funding, at which time the Embassy expressed concern.26
Additional research is needed to understand the limits of oversight, but
at least in the FY06 request, USEUCOM coordinated with only 4 of 14
Embassy staffs prior to submitting its global train and equip
requests.27 The Government Accountability Office did note that
coordination improved in FY07, and a program with Thailand was canceled
after a coup occurred there in 2006.28 Such instances as these give rise
to fears about the militarization of foreign policy. Fundamentally, the
fear stems from the question of who is in charge. On the one hand, the
State Department oversees the security assistance programs that DOD
implements. Yet new models such as 1206/1207 and the Commander's
Emergency Response Program create coordination challenges. In principle,
coordination should occur through the Country Team, which has the best
situational awareness of the country where programs occur. However, with
multiple staffs involved across the region and in Washington, DC, there
are bound to be missteps. Congress noted, "Left unclear, blurred lines
of authority between the State Department and the Defense Department
could lead to interagency turf wars that undermine the effectiveness of
the overall U.S. effort against terrorism."29 Yet Congress acknowledged
that the problem can be solved in the field: "It is in the embassies
rather than in Washington where interagency differences on strategies,
tactics, and divisions of labor are increasingly adjudicated."30 While
combatant commands trumpet regional approaches and Washington-based
bureaucracies herald interagency approaches, all programs, regardless of
funding source, take place in defined geographic territories where U.S.
Ambassadors serve as the whole-of-government representatives. As the
Obama administration attempts to improve interagency coordination, it
will be well served to study U.S. Embassies as a model instead of
focusing on battles across the Potomac. Conclusion While preparation for
war is the military's traditional mission, **[security assistance has
emerged as a key task]{.underline}**. As Title 10 makes clear, "The
Secretary of Defense may conduct military-to-military contacts and
comparable activities that are designed to encourage a democratic
orientation of defense establishments and military forces of other
countries."31 Because [the United States is]{.underline} relatively
secure from interstate rivalry, it is now [focused on intrastate
security deficits]{.underline}. The Quadrennial Defense Review as the
Obama administration attempts to improve interagency coordination, it
will be well served to study U.S. Embassies as a model (QDR) reaffirmed
this: "preventing conflict, stabilizing crises, and building security
sector capacity are essential elements of America's national security
approach."32 Consequently, [preparations for war are giving way to
military operations that focus on]{.underline} humanitarian assistance,
stability operations, and [security assistance]{.underline}. This is not
new. At least since World War II, it has been the interest of the United
States to guarantee American security by reducing threats from abroad
and encouraging a system of global trade to promote American prosperity
and create global interdependence. **[Security assistance has been a key
plank of]{.underline}** this U.S. **[foreign policy
throughout]{.underline}**. [What is different today]{.underline},
however[, is that partners' security challenges now impact U.S. national
securit]{.underline}y. As made clear in the failed airline attack on
Christmas Day in 2009, poor counterterrorism in Yemen or [the lack of
intelligence-sharing in Nigeria can threaten the United States. With
weak governments unable to control territory or channel social
frustration in nonviolent ways, once-local conflicts are now
international]{.underline}. **[This places security assistance programs
at the forefront of U.S. foreign policy to help]{.underline}** allies,
friends, and **[partners]{.underline}**. With few exceptions,
**[partners' security forces are too small, poorly equipped, and ill
trained to effectively monitor and secure their borders and prevent
transnational actors from exploiting security deficits]{.underline}**.
[Consequently, the United States has stepped up its security assistance
efforts and finds its military forces in more countries than
ever.]{.underline} The forces seldom engage in direct combat operations
but are training, equipping, and mentoring partner countries'
militaries. Through State Department and Defense Department programs,
these efforts total more than \$7 billion annually. Overall, [these
programs are a part of]{.underline} U.S. grand [strategy]{.underline},
[which emphasizes military-to-military relations to strengthen weak
states and confront nonstate actors]{.underline}. Given the size of
security assistance and fears of a militarized foreign policy, the Obama
administration is attempting to rebalance U.S. foreign policy. Made
clear in the 2010 QDR, **[security assistance is an invaluable
tool]{.underline}**. Almost [every country in the world demands it, and
it has the long-term potential to alleviate the stress on the U.S.
national security bureaucracy by creating viable partners]{.underline}.
This goal is shared by the Department of State and Department of
Defense, which seek to combat irregular threats and prevent future
conflicts. With this in mind, security assistance should not fall victim
to reorganization or fiscal limits. Instead, [the U.S. Government should
strengthen]{.underline} the Chief of Mission authority of the
Ambassadors in countries where [these programs]{.underline} take place
[to ensure that its goals are met, partners develop capacity, and
countries graduate from assistance programs]{.underline}. PRISM

#### Second, only CONTINUING aid but with STRINGS ATTACHED can solve that---

---fosters political stability, ends coup attempts and reforms ethnic
and personal armies

Assisting Reform For many African countries, **[military reform
is]{.underline}** thus **[necessary to achieve stable democratic
institutions over the long-term]{.underline}**. [Militaries must be
insulated from political tampering, whether personally or ethnically
motivated. Existing ethnic armies must]{.underline} also [be
restructured such that soldiers are no longer recruited and promoted
based on their ethnic identity]{.underline}. [Only then can power be
safely transferred between elected leaders without the constant danger
of military intervention]{.underline}. Nationally representative armies
may also assist in better constraining chief executives within their
constitutional limits, thus averting other forms of autocratic
regression. [What is needed is the proliferation and entrenchment of
merit-based military institutions]{.underline}. Once well established,
systems of merit-based recruitment and promotion insulate soldiers from
purges, demotions, and other negative outcomes due to their ethnic
identity or political leanings. Soldiers then have less reason to fear
personal consequences resulting from social unrest or democratic
rotations of power, thereby lessening military resistance to
democratization and increasing their political neutrality. **[The
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates and other international
actors **[can assist with such reform in]{.underline}** three **[key
ways]{.underline}**. First, [reform can threaten existing armies and
destabilize regimes in the short term. The on-the-ground presence of
neutral foreign]{.underline} troops or [advisors can dampen fears,
ensure fairness, and]{.underline} even **[shield struggling civilian
governments from coup attempts]{.underline}** [during
restructuring]{.underline}. Second, **[security sector reform
programs]{.underline}** and military-to-military exchange and training
programs **[can offer direct assistance in developing and implementing
merit-based]{.underline}** recruitment and promotion
**[systems]{.underline}**. Finally, financial [incentives could be used
to reward African governments for maintaining such systems]{.underline}.
Of course, these measures are no panacea and cannot substitute for a
domestic willingness to grapple with reform. But **[we can reward,
assist, and]{.underline}** even **[protect]{.underline}** those
**[African governments who are trying to build a better democratic
future for their country]{.underline}**. Protective Boots on the Ground
Dismantling existing patronage networks, ethnic or otherwise, within the
military directly threatens officers with the capacity to violently halt
reform efforts. Soldiers may fear they will be unable to meet
meritocratic standards. Or they may fear democratic reforms merely
provide a palatable cover for displacing current officers in favor of
another political or ethnic network. In either case, [the existing army
may resist restructuring, creating the very instability such reform
ultimately seeks to prevent. AFRICOM]{.underline}, working with other
regional and international actors, [could play a **pivotal role** in
helping governments to overcome these short-term challenges and
implement reforms]{.underline} by putting boots on the ground. The most
precarious period of restructuring is the initial transition from ethnic
(or political) loyalty to meritocratic recruitment and promotion
policies. During this time, fears may run high as new systems quickly
replace old practices and previously excluded groups have entered the
military in significant but small numbers, posing a threat to the
existing dominant group but still easily sidelined or purged. The
presence of ground troops or military advisors can dampen fears and
shield civilian governments as this initial restructuring takes place.
Just as in the aftermath of civil wars, foreign personnel are neutral to
existing conflicts and can pass reliable information to all sides about
compliance with regulations, rumored troop movements, and other
indicators of defection from, or cooperation with, the new system. They
can thus reduce fear and uncertainty and prevent accidents from
spiraling out of control.33 Foreign troops or advisors can also act as
early warning systems for coup plots by monitoring military movements,
thereby discouraging hardliners from violent resistance to reforms. Such
monitoring takes away from any planned attack the elements of stealth
and surprise---which are crucial to successful coup attempts. Yet,
sending significant numbers of military personnel in support of reform,
even advisors, would encounter serious obstacles. Placing troops on the
ground relies on both the willingness of the host country to accept
foreign military personnel, and the willingness of external actors to
supply them. In the aftermath of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the
United States has been hesitant to put boots on the ground, even in
small numbers---although sending advisors may be a more palatable
option. Even AFRICOM's ability to send advising and training personnel
is limited. Under the Army's Regionally Aligned Force (RAF) concept, a
brigade has been attached to AFRICOM since 2013. Teams can be deployed
in support of training missions, but they are generally short missions
involving small numbers of personnel.34 Equally important, the African
Union has long emphasized finding "African solutions to African
problems" and the common stance of the vast majority of African
countries is to discourage hosting foreign troops. Stationing combat
troops, or even large advising teams, on African soil could thus
seriously damage perceptions of, and support for, AFRICOM.35 Whether
small advising teams could deter or prevent determined military
opposition to reform remains an open question. Training in Support of
Merit Even where reforming democracies cannot be directly protected,
**[training assistance is still vital to their success]{.underline}**.
[For countries that have long operated by other norms, creating and
maintaining systems of merit based recruitment and promotion is neither
intuitive nor easy]{.underline}. To ensure that officer recruitment and
promotions are based on merit rather than political or ethnic loyalty,
military academies and advanced staff colleges may need to be
established, restructured, expanded, or their curricula overhauled, to
tie advancement in the ranks to continuing education. Decisions must be
made over the qualities and achievements militaries seek to reward for
each rank and career track and then performance indicators, promotion
criteria, pay scales, entrance and advancement tests, and other
incentives designed on that basis. And both [civilian and military
personnel must be trained to administer and continually improve such
systems. Well versed in these procedures, the US military can offer
critical assistance to fledgling democracies in the process of building
them. **The United States could tie**]{.underline} such **[training into
existing programs]{.underline}**. First, [AFRICOM, working with the
State Department, is currently extensively involved in training partner
nations to enhance their own long-term ability to provide
security]{.underline}. [The Africa]{.underline} Contingency Operations
and [Training Assistance]{.underline} (ACOTA) [program]{.underline},
part of the Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI), [has]{.underline}
already [partnered with]{.underline} 25 African countries to train over
77,000 [African peacekeepers]{.underline}. In the last few years, [the
program has shifted away from direct training and toward enhancing local
training infrastructures]{.underline}.36 Similarly, Operation Juniper
Shield has trained company-sized forces from 10 African nations in the
trans-Sahel to increase border security and counter the illicit flow of
people, goods, and arms across the region.37 These existing advisory
teams could assist in expanding military education programs to prepare
soldiers for merit-based promotion protocols and help develop
performance indicators and promotion criteria while deployed on
missions. Second, International Military Education Training (IMET) and
Expanded International Military Education Training (E-IMET) programs
already focus on human rights, military professionalization,
understanding civilian control of the military, and judicial reform.38
Building merit-based systems seems a natural extension to this important
work. Finally, [AFRICOM has also participated in Security Sector Reform
programs that involve more extensive restructuring of security forces,
especially after civil wars]{.underline}. Operation Onward Liberty, for
example, saw 50-60 uniformed military advisors sent to Liberia to assist
with reform.39 In such cases, a rare opportunity exists to rebuild the
defense sector almost from the ground-up and measures that promote merit
could be folded into existing security sector reform efforts.
[Increasing the US training role during military reform efforts would,
moreover, align well with existing strategy in the region. AFRICOM's
priority is to "lead from behind": building partner capacity and
preventing conflict while enabling African nations to solve their own
security concerns.]{.underline}40 [Increased]{.underline}
military-to-military [exchanges]{.underline} would hopefully [strengthen
partnerships between US and African forces while creating more robust
and stable local military institutions and civil-military relations over
the long-term.]{.underline} Financial Incentives Finally, [external
actors can develop financial incentives that reward African countries
for establishing merit based recruitment and promotion systems and
dissuade their dismantlement]{.underline}. **[Military
aid]{.underline}**, or broader forms of development aid, **[can be tied
directly to maintaining meritocratic and politically neutral security
institutions]{.underline}**. Of course, the United States gives military
aid for a variety of reasons---including for counterterrorism, counter
narcotics, and other strategic purposes---and thus may not wish to tie
much of its aid package to merit-based restructuring. Even bonus funds,
however, for steps taken in the right direction might still make a
difference, especially given the cash-strapped nature of many African
states. Beyond aid, other types of rewards could include additional
spaces in military education and exchange programs, priority for
assignment to regional and international peacekeeping operations, and
higher pay rates for participation in them. **[Such]{.underline}**
financial and prestige **[rewards]{.underline}** **[would]{.underline}**
**[encourage governments to begin reform efforts and make it costly for
them to tamper with merit-based systems in the future.]{.underline}**

#### Third, it's the controlling internal link -- Without SSR, there can be NO sustainable development and instability and conflict are inevitable -- Aff solves nothing

Adedeji **[Ebo]{.underline}**, Ph.D., Chief of the Security Sector
Reform Unit in the Office of Rule of Law and Security Institutions,
United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations. He is co-Chair of
the United Nations Inter-Agency Task Force on Security Sector Reform,

IMPORTANT? A UNITED NATIONS PERSPECTIVE,
https://www.cigionline.org/sites/default/files/the_future_of_security_sector_reform.pdf

[For security to be sustainable and viable, SSR is targeted at the
security of the]{.underline} individual [citizen]{.underline},
[communities and the state, all of which are interlinked.
I]{.underline}n some contexts, there is a considerable gap between
security agencies and ordinary citizens. In his opening remarks at the
African Regional Workshop on SSR co-hosted by the African Union (AU) and
the UN in Addis Ababa in March 2009, AU Commissioner for Peace and
Security, Ambassador Ramtane Lamamra, provided a frank assessment of
these gaps and emphasized why SSR matters in the African context:
despite the definite advances achieved in Africa in the area of peace
and security, in particular those derived from the clear political will
and efforts by Member States, working through the African Union,
challenges remain in the form of continued conflicts, a relapse into
conflict even after peace has been brokered, and weak states unable to
secure either their territory or their citizenry. Some Member States
face huge challenges that make it difficult for them to fulfill their
security obligations to their own citizens. In other Member States, the
security forces have, for one reason or another, become a threat to
ordinary citizens. For these reasons, some African Member States clearly
need to reform their security sectors (Lamamra, 2009). The rationale of
SSR, according to a number of key SSR actors, is that **[a reformed
security sector]{.underline}** --- efficient, democratically governed
and based on transparency and accountability --- **[is a major tool for
conflict prevention, stability, peacebuilding and sustainable
development]{.underline}**. In societies recovering from war, **[SSR is
an essential element]{.underline}** [for the timely withdrawal of a
peacekeeping operation, early recovery, sustainable peacebuilding and
longer-term development]{.underline}. In other contexts, **[it is a
conflict-prevention mechanism]{.underline}**. Put simply, [SSR
contributes to the security of states]{.underline} and citizens,
**[without which there can be no sustainable]{.underline}** economic or
political **[development.]{.underline}**

#### Fourth, [comparatively outweighs]{.underline} the risks of military aid -- Comprehensive studies conclude assistance is not the key link to their impacts, and is net-stabilizing

Risks in Security Sector Assistance for Africa\'s Fragile States,
http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR800/RR808/RAND_RR808.pdf

[This report has focused on documenting the risks]{.underline} that
[security sector assistance poses to the fragile states of
Africa]{.underline}: their extent, the specific mechanisms by which they
operate, the reasons for these risks, the manner in which the U.S.
government currently deals with these risks, and ways in which the
United States could do better. Most such **[risks are relatively small
scale]{.underline}**: **[They may be a relatively minor contributing
factor to long-standing inter-communal tensions]{.underline}**, or
**[they may weaken governance institutions that were]{.underline}**
**[already severely flawed]{.underline}**. But the potential exists for
more serious failures that may reverberate in ways that do long-lasting
damage to U.S. foreign policy. **[The focus on risk is not meant to
imply that the negative]{.underline}** secondand third-order
**[consequences are the predominant outcomes]{.underline}**. Indeed,
**[the quantitative evidence reviewed in this report provides reason to
believe that security sector assistance is, on balance, a stabilizing
influence.]{.underline}** [The report's focus was instead motivated by a
desire to improve the functioning of such assistance and to avoid having
one or more high-profile failures in the future cause the United States
to pull back from all such efforts.]{.underline}

Andrew J. Shapiro, Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military
Affairs, former Sr. Advisor to Secretary of State Clinton, CSIS, The
Washington Quarterly 35:4 pp. 233-5, Fall 2012,

[With the United States seeking to]{.underline} grow and [strengthen
its]{.underline} network of partnerships and enhance existing
[alliances, U.S. security cooperation]{.underline} has
[become]{.underline} an **[increasingly critical]{.underline}**
component of U.S. engagement. When the United States through its
[security]{.underline} cooperation and, more specifically, security
[assistance]{.underline} efforts [enhances the **military capabilities
of**]{.underline} its [**allies** and partners, it also strengthens
their ability to **handle their own security**. This assistance also
increases the combined capabilities]{.underline} [which can be used to
address common security challenges, enhances
interoperability]{.underline} between forces, [and enables more
flexible]{.underline} burden-sharing arrangements in [joint
operations]{.underline}. [Additionally]{.underline}, **[cooperating in
the security sector]{.underline}**---perhaps [the **most sensitive
area** for any country---serves to strengthen our **broader diplomatic
relationships**]{.underline}. [U.S. security assistance therefore
can]{.underline} help [strengthen global and regional]{.underline}
[security, while]{.underline} at the same time [alleviating]{.underline}
some of the [demands on U.S. forces]{.underline}. When evaluating the
current geopolitical position of the United States, some have pointed to
the rise of new powers, the economic downturn, and the challenges faced
during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to argue that the central
position of the United States in global affairs is slipping. This claim,
however, overlooks a crucial trend: [countries around the
world]{.underline} [increasingly want to partner]{.underline} with the
United States, particularly in the security sector. More and more
countries seek to establish more robust security ties, to engage and
interact with U.S. forces, [and]{.underline} to [acquire U.S.
defense]{.underline} [systems. This]{.underline} not only demonstrates
the continued centrality of the United States, but it also [represents a
significant strategic opportunity]{.underline}. Over the coming decade,
[building]{.underline} new [partnerships will be
increasingly]{.underline} [critical to U.S. national
security]{.underline}. As Secretary of Defense Panetta explained
recently, ''the United States must place even greater strategic emphasis
on [building the security capabilities of others, and adopting a more
collaborative]{.underline} [approach to security]{.underline} both
within the United States government and [among allies]{.underline},
partners, and multilateral organizations.''2 When the U.S. government is
looking for cost-effective ways to achieve its strategic objectives at
home and around the world, security assistance with allies and partners
[is]{.underline} an [increasingly important]{.underline} national
security priority. However, the ability of the United States to provide
security assistance may come under strain; the State Department's budget
is often a target for cuts in fiscally difficult times, and an
underestimation of the strategic importance of these programs could
limit the ability of the United States to partner in the years ahead.
Security Partners in an Interconnected World The United States, as the
world's pre-eminent military power, has long served as a guarantor of
global security. Together with a robust global network of alliances and
partners, American military, economic, and diplomatic leadership has
served [to **deter outliers** and **assist countries in
need**]{.underline}. While the intense superpower rivalry and
large-scale geopolitical competition that characterized the Cold War and
previous eras may be absent today, the challenges to maintaining
international peace and stability are still many, and in some ways have
become more complex. Countries around the world increasingly want to
partner with the United States. Andrew J. Shapiro 24 THE WASHINGTON
QUARTERLY j FALL 2012 Secretary Clinton has observed that ''the geometry
of global power is becoming more distributed and diffuse even as the
challenges we face become more complex and cross-cutting.''3 [States
today often worry more about the]{.underline} potential [weakness or
instability of a neighbor]{.underline}, rather than its strength. [For
many]{.underline} [countries]{.underline} and regions, [their most
direct security challenges are rooted in the gaps]{.underline} [of
governance and authority that allow]{.underline} [refuge to nefarious
actors]{.underline}. [These]{.underline} [ungoverned spaces]{.underline}
can [spawn terrorism]{.underline}, illicit [trafficking]{.underline},
[piracy]{.underline}, [and rebel groups]{.underline}. [They can also
become **exporters of instability**, **impacting entire
regions**]{.underline}. Take the example of [Somalia]{.underline}, which
[as a]{.underline} [failed state has given rise to a new
wave]{.underline} [of]{.underline} [piracy, posing a challenge to global
shipping---**the life-blood of the global economy**---and causing
**significant instability in the broader region**]{.underline}. While
inter-state conflict has declined, [state-based threats also
remain]{.underline}. Global outliers, such as [countries like Iran and
North Korea, continue to threaten neighbors, **stoke regional tension**,
and **endanger U.S. security**]{.underline}, [requiring the United
States and its allies to remain vigilant]{.underline}. [**In a world so
interconnected**, with **global supply chains**, highly developed global
financial systems, and unprecedented]{.underline} global travel and
[connectivity, the]{.underline} potential [**impact** of these threats
has become **magnified**]{.underline}. [Today, with greater global
interconnectedness]{.underline}, there are [**more and more
places**]{.underline} that [**can** impact the security of the United
States. Furthermore, the **speed** at which change can occur has
**increased**]{.underline}. For example, the Arab Spring helped bring
about sweeping change to the Middle East, creating tremendous
uncertainty as well as significant opportunity. Rapid economic growth
has also lifted millions out of poverty and increased the geopolitical
clout of rising powers like Brazil, India, and China, as well as made
the Asia---Pacific a region of growing importance to the United States.
This creates new challenges for U.S. global leadership. Secretary
Panetta recently explained that ''\[i\]n the past, the United States
often assumed the primary role of defending others. We built permanent
bases. We deployed large forces across the globe to fixed positions. We
often assumed that others were not willing or capable of defending
themselves.''4 This meant the United States spread out wherever it
thought it needed to. [Today's interconnected world,]{.underline}
however, [is simply **too large a playing field**---the United States
cannot]{.underline} [be everywhere]{.underline}. As former Secretary of
Defense Gates argued in 2009, ''the United States cannot expect to
eliminate national security risks through higher defense budgets, to do
everything and buy everything.''5 A growing multitude of demands means
that it is in the interests of the United States to encourage others to
shoulder more of the costs and responsibilities of global security. All
countries benefit from a global environment that is stable and
prosperous, and many could do more to take an active role in supporting
it. However, as Secretary Gates argued, [the United States]{.underline}
itself [could do]{.underline} [more to expand the capabilities of its
partners]{.underline}. He concluded that ''strategic reality demands
that the U.S. government get better at building partner capacity.''6
Empowering Allies and Partners [Security assistance has long been an
important tool in **sustaining and advancing U.S. global
leadership**]{.underline}. However, the nature of security assistance
has changed compared to decades past. Once a tool viewed through the
prism of the Cold War, [security assistance is now]{.underline} more
[about enabling the capabilities of partner states so they can
contribute to **internal and regional security**]{.underline}. [Security
assistance includes]{.underline} a broad array of tools, including
[direct military]{.underline} grant [assistance]{.underline}, the
[sale]{.underline} or transfer [of military items and equipment,
and]{.underline} [training]{.underline} peacekeepers or supporting
de-mining efforts. One of the most direct ways the United States can
help is through the sale or transfer of U.S. defense equipment. The
United States can sell or transfer weapon systems and military items
through its [Foreign Military Sales]{.underline} (FMS) program, which
are governmentto-government sales. The United States also helps build
the capacity of partners through its Foreign Military Financing (FMF)
program, which provides funding assistance to countries to buy U.S.
defense items. Indeed, U.S. assistance [gives]{.underline} [countries
the tools to confront security challenges]{.underline} in several
different areas, [including increasing]{.underline} the
[interoperability between forces, confronting]{.underline}
[transnational threats, addressing maritime security]{.underline},
[professionalizing a military]{.underline}, [training international
peacekeepers]{.underline}, [and combating weapons
proliferation]{.underline}. [When allies]{.underline} and partners
[acquire U.S. defense systems, it can provide a]{.underline} [foundation
for **increasing collaboration** between forces]{.underline}. [The use
of similar military]{.underline} [platforms helps streamline operations
and reduce]{.underline} the potential for [problems]{.underline} [when
coordinating]{.underline} between highly advanced and complicated
defense systems. [For example, Japan's recent decision to purchase the
F-35 to replace their]{.underline} aging F-4 [fighters will]{.underline}
help [ensure compatibility with U.S. forces]{.underline}. Therefore, the
[sales]{.underline} [of transport aircraft, vehicles, communication
equipment, precision munitions]{.underline}, [fighter aircraft, naval

rockets [not only help U.S. allies and partners become more
secure]{.underline}, [they better]{.underline} [enable forces to fight
side by side]{.underline} in places like Afghanistan. Over the last two
decades[, U.S. security assistance has also greatly
increased]{.underline} [its focus on empowering states to **deal with
transnational threats** such as drug]{.underline} [traffickers,
terrorists, and criminal networks]{.underline} and smugglers. [These
non-state]{.underline} [actors]{.underline} often operate in the
shadows, threaten communities, and [undermine state]{.underline}
[authority and the rule of law]{.underline}. U.S. assistance helps
address these challenges. Last year, as part of a larger assistance
effort, the United States provided security assistance to Mexico under
the Merida Initiative, which included the transfer of three Blackhawk
helicopters to the Mexican military. These [helicopters
provide]{.underline} the Mexican government with greater
[mobility]{.underline} and will increase their ability [to reach
remote]{.underline} mountainous [locations]{.underline}---a capability
[of]{.underline} [crucial importance in the fight]{.underline} against
drug cartels and traffickers. [The United States also works]{.underline}
with countries [to **enhance maritime security**]{.underline}. [This is
critical to securing vital trade]{.underline} [routes, preventing
trafficking, criminality at sea, and piracy]{.underline}. In Indonesia,
the United States is supporting the construction of an Improved Maritime
Domain Awareness [radar]{.underline} array that will [allow the
government to track transiting ships]{.underline} in the same way that
aircraft controllers track planes. This will further enhance the
capabilities of the Indonesian government in their efforts [to counter
the threat]{.underline} of piracy and criminality at sea. In another
example, since first receiving U.S. security assistance in 2005,
Bangladesh has focused on building [patrol boat fleets]{.underline} for
its Coast Guarda project that will [improve both coastline security
and]{.underline} Bangladesh's [ability to respond to natural
disasters]{.underline}, as well as strengthen the government's presence
in isolated areas. [By equipping our allies]{.underline} and partners
[with the necessary systems to secure their territories and]{.underline}
patrol and [police their borders, U.S. security assistance plays an
important role in **furthering**]{.underline} the [**stability** of
these countries]{.underline}. Our [security cooperation and
assistance]{.underline} efforts [go beyond providing]{.underline}
[equipment. The United States works directly with]{.underline} many
[allies]{.underline} and partners [to **professionalize their military
forces** through training and joint]{.underline} military
[exercises]{.underline}. [Countries with weak, poorly trained, and
poorly resourced militaries are]{.underline} often [unable to control
their territories, protect human rights, or create a stable]{.underline}
and [safe environment for their citizens. This endangers neighbors and
threatens]{.underline} the [stability of nascent democratic
states]{.underline}. [Conducting training and joint
exercises]{.underline} [not only helps countries, but working
side-by-side with partners can]{.underline} help [improve the
capabilities of the U.S. military by improving **professional and
cultural awareness** that cannot be gained except through direct
contact]{.underline}.

A series of strategy documents promulgated by the last three American
administrations all note the decreasing prospect of large-scale
interstate conflict. 1 [It is becoming increasingly difficult to imagine
**realistic scenarios** of conventional conflict along the lines of the
**world wars**]{.underline}. Needless to say, this does not mean that
violent conflict will cease to trouble the world community. [Warfare
associated with the **fragmentation of states, clashes among warlords**
and other shadowy contestants for political and economic influence, and
**attempts by the developed world to suppress dangerous behavior** by
states operating outside accepted international norms - all **remain
familiar**]{.underline} in the present, [**and likely** in the
future]{.underline}. [**There is no question that violence of this
lesser and still familiar kind can** **imperil the stability of the
international system as a whole**]{.underline}. Yet it is able to do so
[only **by virtue of the** **reactions it may inspire among the
system\'s strongest members**]{.underline}. In the final analysis a
crisis among such states can only be brought about by their own actions.
The only way for \"[rogue states\" and \"non-state actors]{.underline}\"
to achieve true strategic leverage is to [induce the most powerful
members of the system to **act in ways that are self-defeating, even if
they are not foreseen as such.**]{.underline}

Given the importance of SSA relationships to both the United States and
its partners, the United States should develop a policy framework for
leveraging SSA with conditions to achieve other policy objectives. [Some
experts have asserted that unconditional aid recipients are less likely
than other states to align their policies with U.S.
objectives.]{.underline}37 [This implies that wherever possible, poli-
cymakers should seek to build conditionality into SSA to incentivize a
partner country's coopera- tion on U.S. policy objectives.
Conditionality likely is most successful when the donor has greater
leverage in the relationship; attempting to create leverage when the
recipient has the advantage often yields poor results]{.underline}.38

All U.S. security assistance to foreign partners carries conditions, in
terms of how the assistance will be utilized and for what purpose or
objective.39 Historically, U.S. policymakers have employed negative
conditionality, which entails threatening to end, suspend, or reduce
assistance to partner countries if certain conditions are not met.40
[For instance, EUM programs ensure that U.S. defense articles
transferred to partner countries are used in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the transfer agreement and U.S. law.41 While the
threat to curtail aid may be useful in putting pressure on a partner
country, the threat is only as good as the donor country's willingness
to enforce it and the partner country's dependence on the United
States.42 Additionally, by imposing unilateral conditions on SSA, the
United States may undermine e orts to build an e ective and
collaborative partnership with the recipient country.]{.underline}

[Since the Cold War, development organizations have sought to positively
condition economic assistance to encourage democratic reforms and good
governance initiatives]{.underline}. In [the realm of SSA, the United
States has employed positive conditionality to increase partner country
buy-in and incentivize reform. For instance, since 2007 the United
States has sought to develop Lebanese Armed Forces' special operations
forces (SOF) capacity to counter Sunni extremist groups in Lebanon.43
The United States rewarded Lebanon's improved performance by providing
increased capabilities]{.underline}.44 Today, Lebanese SOF are a
critical partner in containing the Islamic State and al Qaeda a
liates.45

Recently, policymakers have begun to explore how positive conditionality
could be linked to SSA to induce partner countries to undertake
democratic reforms, strengthen rule of law, and uphold

BOX 2.2. The Millennium Challenge Corporation

The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is an innovative U.S. federal
agency working to reduce global poverty, established in 2004 to change
the way the United States provided develop- ment assistance.1 For a
country to be eligible for MCC assistance, it must demonstrate a commit-
ment to "just and democratic governance, investments in its people, and
economic freedom."2 The MCC works in close partnership with selected
countries to identify development priorities and to create a grant
agreement---a "compact"---that serves as a road map for the development
assistance program.3 Each compact is expected to articulate development
goals, impediments to implement- ing the program and achieving its
objectives, mitigation steps, performance indicators, and a detailed
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) plan.4

[The MCC's pioneering approach to compact development assistance could
be usefully applied to SSA.5 Partner countries with strong commitments
to governance, transparency, and rule of law would be eligible for the
grant-like program. Partners would work in close collaboration with U.S.
policymakers and planners to identify long-term objectives and design a
road map for assistance with intermediary goals, mitigation steps to
reduce risk, and a rigorous M&E regime. Partner coun- tries would also
have implementation responsibilities. This process would help ensure
that SSA programs are designed to re ect the realities of the partner
country, promote shared objectives, and facilitate monitoring and
evaluation best practices.]{.underline}

Review sought to inte- grate the "3Ds" of foreign policy---development,
diplomacy, and defense. [This document encouraged policymakers to think
about conditionality linkages between SSA and broader democratic and
governance reforms.46 Although few examples of positively conditioned
security assistance exist, lessons from the development sector imply
that this form of conditionality may be more fruitful than punitive
forms.]{.underline}

Strengths, Weaknesses, and Gaps

[When strategically applied, conditionality has the potential to
mitigate risks, strengthen security partnerships, and incentivize good
behavior. Policymakers can employ punitive conditionality to mitigate
the risk that a partner country will abuse U.S. SSA.]{.underline}
Transparent, positive conditionality, in which U.S. policymakers
collaborate with recipient countries to develop a road map for SSA,
would help incentivize reform and likely result in stronger partnerships
and a better alignment of policy objectives between donor and recipient
countries.47 [Conditioning SSA to promote interna- tional norms and
human rights demonstrates U.S. commitment to these values, mandates
better behavior among current partner countries, and may also signal and
influence the behavior of those seeking SSA in the
future.48]{.underline}

#### Leahy provides a powerful tool to suspend arms -- checks back on human rights and maintains relations**[.]{.underline}**

https://www.amnestyusa.org/deconstructing-the-leahy-law-fact-vs-fiction/

There are some misconceptions currently floating around about the U.S.
government's Leahy Law and we want to set the record straight on a few
things. [The Leahy Law is a **powerful yet often-overlooked tool** to
help prevent the U.S. government from directly arming human rights
violators in the ranks of foreign security forces and to help the U.S.
avoid complicity in the commission of human rights
violations]{.underline}. So how can you distill fact from fiction? Allow
us to deconstruct some of the facts, fictions and misconceptions about
the Leahy Law. And expect more in the coming weeks about this important
law, and other instruments available to the U.S. and global community to
prevent arming human rights perpetrators. What is the Leahy Law? [The
Leahy Law]{.underline} (also known as the Leahy Amendment)
[prohibits]{.underline} most types of U.S. foreign [aid]{.underline} and
Defense Department training programs from going [to foreign security,
military and police units credibly alleged to have committed human
rights violations]{.underline}. If the foreign government brings the
responsible members of the unit to justice, U.S. foreign aid can be
resumed. The Leahy Law is named after Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), a
Congressional human rights champion and the chief sponsor of the law.
Fact: [The Leahy Law is law, not a policy guideline]{.underline}. It
originated in 1996 from efforts to control U.S. military aid to Colombia
during the period in time when Plan Colombia was materializing and
Amnesty International and many other organizations had been documenting
egregious violations committed by the Colombian military and police. [It
is different from other human rights legislation because it does not
require a decision to cut off aid to an entire country]{.underline} --
which the U.S. government is often reluctant to do -- [rather **it
tackles the challenge by prohibiting aid solely from the offending
units**.]{.underline} Fiction: The Leahy Law solves the human rights
problems of foreign military and police units. Interestingly, the Leahy
Law places the burden on both the U.S. government and human rights
organizations to document and compile information regarding alleged
abuses -- but the law and associated vetting process is not perfect, nor
will it alone solve the human rights problems of foreign security units.
Take for example, the vetting process itself. The U.S. government
currently utilizes Google key word searches as a first step in its
online investigation (and for those who aren't familiar with this type
of search, it does not pick up information in PDFs -- so a tip for
fellow human rights organizations: make sure your reports are also
available in HTML/text). Additional staff dedicated solely to the
vetting process have, however, recently been added to the State
Department's payroll -- indicating that this process may be
strengthening. The Leahy Law is by no means a silver bullet- take for
example the gap in oversight of arms sales which the recently adopted
(and. we hope, soon to be signed and ratified by the U.S.) Arms Trade
Treaty promises to fill. The Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) requires that arms
exporters conduct an assessment of the risk that the arms could be used
in committing human rights violations, and to take measures to mitigate
that risk or halt the transfer if the risk reaches a certain level.
[Even this type of historic, multilateral agreement cannot stop all
human rights abuses]{.underline}, though. While the government's
obligation to respect, protect and fulfill human rights requires a
comprehensive approach, [measures such as enacting the Leahy
Law]{.underline} and ratifying the ATT [are critical]{.underline}, and
as such require political will and the determination of the people to
hold the government to account. Misconception: Changes in the law two
years ago aimed at strengthening its enforcement have complicated U.S.
military leaders' ability to train and equip foreign security forces.
The recent revisions to the law strengthen the ability of the U.S.
government to ensure that the U.S. is not complicit in arming
perpetrators of human rights violations and further encourages
accountability. Often, identifying individual perpetrators amongst the
ranks is difficult in repressive or insecure environs -- victims and
their families, facing opaque judicial systems, can be intimidated into
silence. This is why the U.S. government now bans entire units from
receiving foreign assistance. So while the changes in the law add
additional safeguards which may be perceived by military officials as
unnecessary barriers in their ability to expeditiously train foreign
forces, [the safeguards further ensure the U.S. is not arming
perpetrators. Military leaders should therefore embrace, not criticize
the recent amendments, as ultimately, they help to ensure the U.S. is
not complicit in the commission of future abuses by training foreign
combatant with a poor human rights record]{.underline}. Fact: The Leahy
Law has had an impact. [**The Leahy Law has saved lives** since its
passage and it provides an incentive to countries whose security forces'
possess poor human rights records to clean up their act. U.S.
policymakers should be looking for ways to make this law and others like
it stronger, and in doing so, **strengthen the United States' security
and standing abroad**.]{.underline} The truth is, there is no human
rights panacea -- it's an ongoing struggle, waged by those who believe
in basic rights protections for everyone. [The Leahy Law is one critical
tool in that struggle]{.underline}. Its effectiveness is measured in
human rights violations prevented -- for those to outweigh the U.S.
military's professed inconveniences, the voices of those who fight for
human right must be heard.

#### But it's enforced unevenly now -- that's a disaster

[Leahy\'s combination of security assistance restrictions and
accountability mechanisms has produced surprisingly significant human
rights results]{.underline}.\" While the U.S. government rarely invoked
§ 2304 to restrict security assistance in four decades, in just one
three-year period, [Leahy barred U.S. security assistance to 2516 units
of foreign militaries due to human rights concerns]{.underline}.M [In
2011 alone, Leahy denied U.S. security assistance to 1766 foreign troops
accused of human rights violations in forty-six
countries]{.underline}.65 [Leahy successfully withheld military
assistance to foreign security forces responsible for gross violations
of human rights in Bangladesh]{.underline}, [Colombia, Guatemala,
Honduras, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Turkey, and Sri
Lanka]{.underline}.\" [Leahy\'s]{.underline} impact has not been limited
to barring security assistance; the statute\'s [anti-impunity measure
has coerced accountability for human rights abusers in Indonesia,
Honduras, Guatemala, Colombia, and Bangladesh]{.underline}. 67 [In
Honduras,]{.underline} for example, [Juan Carlos \"El Tigre\" Bonilla
ascended to lead the Honduran National Police despite credible
allegations that he was responsible for gross human rights
violations]{.underline}, including participating in the Los Magnificos
death squad.68 [The Honduran government removed Mr. Bonilla from his
position due to pressure from the United States to take effective steps
against Mr. Bonilla or risk a suspension of security
assistance]{.underline}.69 However, Leahy has sometimes failed, with
security assistance reaching units despite credible information about a
gross human rights violation.70 Human rights groups and others have
reported that Leahy failed to withhold security assistance to abusive
units in Colombia, Afghanistan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Israel, and
Honduras.7 1 Many consider Colombia the test case for Leahy, as the law
was originally enacted in response to United States\' interest in
significantly increasing assistance to Colombian security forces.7\"
[Although Leahy has shown that it can be effective in Colombia, Leahy
was unevenly enforced there, allowing security assistance to reach
notoriously brutal units of the Colombian military]{.underline}.73 The
high profile failures of Leahy have led some to explore whether judicial
enforcement of Leahy could effectively secure the law\'s human rights
promise.74

This Article presents a strategic\--as opposed to ideological or
normative\--argument that [the promotion of human rights should be given
a more prominent place in U.S. foreign policy]{.underline}. It does so
by suggesting a correlation between the domestic human rights practices
of states and their propensity to engage in aggressive international
conduct. [Among the chief threats to]{.underline} U.S. [national
security are acts of aggression by other states]{.underline}. Aggressive
acts of war may directly endanger the United States, as did the Japanese
bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941, or they may require U.S. military
action overseas, as in Kuwait fifty years later. [Evidence]{.underline}
from the post-Cold War period  \[\*250\]  [indicates that states that
systematically abuse]{.underline} their own citizens\' [human rights
are]{.underline} also [those most likely to engage in aggression. To the
degree that improvements in various states\' human rights records
decrease the likelihood of aggressive war]{.underline}, a foreign
[policy informed by human rights can significantly enhance]{.underline}
U.S. and **[global security]{.underline}**. Since 1990, [a state\'s
domestic human rights policy appears to be a telling indicator of that
state\'s propensity to engage in international aggression]{.underline}.
A central element of U.S. foreign policy has long been the preservation
of peace and the prevention of such acts of aggression.

If the correlation discussed herein is accurate, it provides U.S.
policymakers with a powerful new tool to enhance national security
through the promotion of human rights. A strategic linkage between
national security and human rights would result in a number of important
policy modifications. First, it changes the prioritization of those
countries U.S. policymakers have identified as presenting the greatest
concern. Second, it alters some of the policy prescriptions for such
states. Third, it offers states a means of signaling benign
international intent through the improvement of their domestic human
rights records. Fourth, it provides a way for a current government to
prevent future governments from aggressive international behavior
through the institutionalization of human rights protections. Fifth, [it
addresses the]{.underline} particular [threat of]{.underline} human
rights abusing [states obtaining]{.underline} weapons of mass
destruction (**[WMD]{.underline}**). Finally, it offers a mechanism for
U.S.-U.N. cooperation on human rights issues.

Law School

Nathan. April 14. "WHY DOES INTERNATIONAL LAW EVEN MATTER?"
<https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/04/why-does-international-law-even-matter>

Are international law arguments against Trump similarly secondary?
[Should we be focusing on whether the strike was wrong rather than
whether it was within the scope of the UN charter?]{.underline}
Defenders of the strikes called them "illegal but legitimate," an
argument that has also been used to exonerate Israel for clear
violations of international law. This leaves us caught between two
opposing notions: (1) illegal but legitimate is a reasonable concept,
since it's the foundation of the civil disobedience tradition from
Thoreau to MLK but (2) if "illegal but legitimate" becomes an acceptable
standard in governing the conduct of nations, we might as well give up
on international law altogether, because every country will just violate
the law at will and invoke its subjective conception of "legitimacy,"
which inevitably always means "the things I want to do" since no country
ever thinks its own conduct is illegitimate.

[One reason]{.underline} I think [**violations of international law** do
need to be **taken seriously** is that **international law is very
recent and very fragile**. It is actually less like "law" than a
**collective pact**, one that is often **difficult to enforce** and
which **depends on the good-faith participation** of the various
parties]{.underline}. [It is a bit like **engineering cooperation in a
prisoner's dilemma**]{.underline}. [It's very difficult, because it
requires every party to **limit** their concern for **their own
self-interest** in order to **maximize the collective
good**.]{.underline} [And if one of them betrays the others, the whole
tentative cooperative system **instantly collapses**.]{.underline}

[In 21st century international relations,]{.underline} **[this could
mean utter catastrophe]{.underline}**. [The great powers have to get
along, because their mutual **possession of nuclear arms means that the
stakes of conflict are incalculably high**]{.underline}. [A **functional
cooperative pact** among the nations, that holds each of them to a set
of humane principles, **is essential**]{.underline}. People make fun of
the United Nations and its impotence, but [everyone who cares about the
future of the human race should be invested in curing that impotence and
making sure UN procedures do mean something]{.underline}. Here,
procedure is substance to a certain degree, because [when the world
adopts a process that achieves consensus, there is peace, and when it
doesn't, there isn't, regardless of the substantive question being
debated]{.underline}.

**[That's why]{.underline}** I think **[it's actually incredibly
dangerous and irresponsible for the United States]{.underline}** (and
now France and the UK) [**to treat international law as a meaningless
set of guidelines** that can be **violated at will.**]{.underline} [If
**they don't feel bound by it, why should any other
country?**]{.underline} The brazenness with which, for example, Israel
has spat upon the international community's processes endangers all of
us, because [it **slowly erodes the weak bonds that keep the world from
collapsing into war**.]{.underline}

That's a huge difference with ordinary civil disobedience: Martin Luther
King's actions posed no threat to the country's survival. [The laws he
violated had a very stable and brutal enforcement system, and his
disobedience served to improve them rather than undermine
them]{.underline}. [**The United States' refusal to play by the rules**
set by the international community]{.underline}, on the other hand,
[seriously **threatens to create a world in which nations follow no
rules at all.** Even high-stakes domestic "rule of law" disputes pale in
significance here]{.underline}: perhaps Obama's implementation of DACA
was unconstitutional, and perhaps that set a precedent for expanded
executive power that would come back to bite the left under Trump. But I
don't care very much, because it helped a bunch of kids, and it didn't
"erode the constitutional order" in any way that I find too terribly
troubling. On the other hand, Obama's expansion of presidential war
powers does seem to me somewhat troubling, because the more unchecked
military power presidents have, the more authoritarian the executive
branch can potentially be. How much I care about "rule of law" questions
depends on what the stakes are in undermining the rule of law. If
they're not particularly high, then I'm not going to fetishize procedure
and the Constitution. But [if the law does seem like it's serving a very
important function in holding together institutions and preventing
anarchy]{.underline} (the bad kind rather than the good kind), [then
violations of law should be taken very seriously]{.underline}. (This is
a major indictment of Democrats who did not hold President Obama
accountable for the more serious and threatening expansions of executive
power.)

[International law also has the advantage of being]{.underline},
generally speaking, [pretty good substantively]{.underline}. The limits
it imposes on nations, and the processes it creates for resolving
disputes among them, are sensible. [That's another difference between it
and its domestic equivalent: laws in the United States aren't as worthy
of respect, because they don't embody humane principles nearly as
well]{.underline}. When a legal system does embody a respectable set of
values, we can begin appreciating it as a legal system. I think
international law deserves to be honored not just because it's "the law"
but because it's worthy of being honored, since [it codifies a set of
principles that if adhered to will produce peace]{.underline}. (The laws
of the United States, on the other hand, codify a set of principles that
have led to gross inequalities, environmental destruction, and the
creation of a vast military-industrial complex.)

Legalistic criticisms of nations is always going to seem rather weak.
Surely what matters is whether a thing is just, and if a country had
swooped in to stop the Rwandan genocide, few would have chastised them
for ignoring proper procedure. But **[creating a viable and meaningful
set of international legal standards is crucial to ensuring a future for
the human species]{.underline}**, [and when countries erode the precious
and unstable existing compact, whether Syria, the United States,
Britain, France, Russia, or Israel, and embrace the concept of
"**illegal but legitimate**," they threaten to **undo all of the
progress that has been made** toward ensuring a **lasting world
peace**.]{.underline}

### 2NC Solvency -- Thailand

#### Leverage needs to be used now- US-Thailand relations on brink right now.

**[Kurlantzick 16]{.underline}** (Joshua Kurlantzick is senior fellow
for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). "A New
Approach to Thailand's Insurgency" Council on Foreign Relations.
<https://www.cfr.org/sites/default/files/pdf/2016/09/Discussion_Paper_Kurlantzick_Thailand_OR.pdf>)

Although some U.S.-Thai joint military exercises have continued in
scaled-down numbers since the coup, [some U.S. policymakers worry that,
if the relationship continues to deteriorate, the United States may not
be able to count on Thai ports in the case of a conflict in Southeast
Asia]{.underline} and may also have to relocate Bangkok based operations
for many U.S. government agencies. This shift would consume U.S.
resources and require 10 U.S. officials posted overseas to develop
entirely new networks of relationships, replacing Thai networks that
have been constructed over decades. In addition, if Thailand's security
continues to deteriorate, the U.S. military may be forced to permanently
reduce the size of Cobra Gold and other joint exercises, or even move
them to other partners in the region. More generally, [Thailand's brutal
army tactics]{.underline}, inculcated in the south and now used
nationwide, [has led to a growing culture clash between Thai and U.S.
military officers]{.underline}. This clash has caused a [breakdown in
trust]{.underline} and a loss of contact between Thai generals and U.S.
flag officers and civilian defense officials dealing with Thailand.
[This could be problematic if the United States faces a security crisis
in Southeast Asia, such as a conflict in the South China Sea, and needs
to rely on Thailand's large, modern bases and naval
support]{.underline}. Indeed, Thailand's deteriorating relations with
the United States have led the junta to cultivate much closer diplomatic
links to Moscow and Beijing, further adding to U.S. concerns that the
United States may not be able to utilize Thai bases for operations in
the South China Sea. With Thai leaders focused on domestic turmoil,
including the insurgency, the Thai government has also proven incapable
of providing leadership in regional organizations. This void cannot
easily be filled by other mainland Southeast Asian nations, which are
smaller, poorer, and less effective diplomatically.

Although the south Thailand insurgency is having a significant impact on
Thailand's overall stability, and thus on U.S.-Thailand relations, [the
United States remains Thailand's most important ally.]{.underline} As a
result, Washington has the opportunity to help Bangkok shape a new
strategy toward the south, one that eventually leads to a permanent
southern cease-fire. But if the southern Thailand insurgency continues,
and Bangkok does not abandon its current failed approach, other outside
actors, such as the Islamic State and Al Qaeda, could wield more
influence in the south instead.

#### Now key for US to use their economic and militaristic leverage over Thailand to force them to end HR abuse.

**[Kurlantzick 16]{.underline}** (Joshua Kurlantzick is senior fellow
for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). "A New
Approach to Thailand's Insurgency" Council on Foreign Relations.
<https://www.cfr.org/sites/default/files/pdf/2016/09/Discussion_Paper_Kurlantzick_Thailand_OR.pdf>)

The intensification of the southern insurgency and Thailand's general
political regression has come at the same time that the United States is
attempting to deepen its strategic relations with Southeast Asia as part
of the "rebalance to Asia." Thai governments, which once led Southeast
Asian security and diplomatic alliances, have taken a less active role
in the region and Thailand has become a less reliable partner in
counterterrorism, combating human trafficking, narcotics interdiction,
and other U.S. priorities. Moreover, the cultural divide between the
[Royal Thai Army]{.underline} and U.S. [military officers]{.underline}
[has grown]{.underline} as [control over economic policymaking in
Thailand]{.underline} has increasing shifted into the hands of a few
generals [who have shown little ability to manage Southeast Asia's
second-biggest economy. The United States has a significant stake in
seeing the insurgency ended and Thailand's political regression
reversed]{.underline}. To that end, the United States should work with
the Thai government to help adopt a new approach to the southern
insurgency. To help resolve the southern Thailand insurgency, Bangkok
and Washington could look to examples both from other Southeast Asian
nations and from Thailand's own history, which includes success in
ending a Thai communist insurgency during the Cold War. Indonesia and
the Philippines have taken major steps toward resolving their own
insurgencies, and Myanmar has pacified much of the country in the past
four years. Any strategy to resolve the southern Thailand insurgency
should include an initial guarantee by the Thai military that senior
flag officers, including junta leader and Prime Minister Prayuth
Chan-ocha, will meet and discuss the insurgents' demands, if the
insurgency's top leaders come out of hiding. In addition, the new
approach should include comprehensive peace talks with insurgent leaders
based on the idea of gradually ceding greater political power to the
deep south. Considering decentralization would challenge insurgent
leaders to respond; if they still refuse to discuss peace, the Thai
government will win greater southern public support for tough
counterinsurgency measures. The new approach should focus on punishing
officers whose units have been involved in atrocities and on eventually
allowing elected politicians to oversee the military's actions. 2 The
United States should also encourage the Thai military's return to the
apolitical path, which it appeared to be on in the 1990s and early
2000s. This would enable Thailand to return to a path toward democracy,
and might prove an example for other civil conflicts in Southeast
Asia.Even if the Royal Thai Army wants to remain influential in Thai
politics, allowing officers to abuse civilians is not in the army's
interest. Abuses sustain the insurgency, stain the army's reputation,
lead to isolation by foreign governments, and make it harder for Thai
officers to control their units. It is time to push Thailand to revamp
its approach to the deep south. The insurgency, although lethal, remains
relatively contained to the southern provinces, but that has begun to
change since August 2016. The regular killings of Thai soldiers in the
south demoralize the enlisted ranks and junior officers and make it
harder for the Royal Thai Army to recruit. The United States has close
strategic ties to the Royal Thai Army and the [Thai armed forces are
dependent on U.S. training and arms; therefore, the United States enjoys
significant influence over Thailand. Such clout might not exist ten
years from now if the U.S.-Thailand relationship continues to
deteriorate.]{.underline}

The United States should make clear that the rebalance will increasingly
include funds for helping Southeast Asian nations, including Thailand,
battle insurgencies and attempt to negotiate cease-fires and formal
peace deals. The new U.S. Southeast Asia Maritime Security Initiative is
designed mostly to bolster navies and coast guards, so the White House
should launch a new program, as part of the rebalance, focused on
funding for counterinsurgency. The White House could call this new
program the Southeast Asian Civil Conflict Fund. Aid given to Thailand
as part of a peace deal could be drawn from this fund. Indeed, [U.S.
leaders should emphasize that a new approach to the southern Thailand
conflict would be rewarded with increased aid for the
south]{.underline}---a package worth \$400 million funded by Australia,
the European Union, Japan, Southeast Asian nations, and the United
States' new fund for Southeast Asian civil conflicts. [The United States
could point to other regions of Southeast Asia as
precedent]{.underline}. For example, Aceh has received infusions of aid
from Europe and Japan since the end of its twenty-nine-year civil war in
2005.In Aceh, the promise of new aid packages helped convince militants
to lay down their arms; they were given jobs after the peace process. In
addition, [the United States should make clear to the Thai armed forces
that it will reward them for permanently withdrawing to the barracks
after the 2017 Thai national elections]{.underline} in the same way that
Washington rewarded the Indonesian military for reducing its role in
politics outside of Papua. Washington has rewarded the Indonesian armed
forces by boosting training for the Indonesian army and by authorizing
new sales of missiles and other weaponry to Jakarta, among other
decisions. [Incentives for military professionalization could include
increased training for Thai military officers, greater access to
programs for financing for U.S. weapons purchases, and regular meetings
between the U.S. president and these nations' defense ministers and
other top army officials. At the same time, the United States should
make clear to the Thai armed forces that there will be consequences for
abusive and unprofessional behavior, including coups after
2017]{.underline}. [For the Myanmar armed forces, this could mean not
allowing Myanmar officers to participate in the U.S. International
Military Education and Training program]{.underline}, a change that has
been discussed but not approved by the White House or Congress.
Washington also should make clear to the Thai junta that it has other
options, if necessary, for U.S. agencies' regional offices if the army
does not move toward civilian rule. [Although the United States does not
want to relocate current Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and]{.underline} [U.S. military
operations in Bangkok, closer links with Singapore make this move a
viable option. U.S.]{.underline} officials should simultaneously
[emphasize]{.underline} to the Thai armed forces [that ending
insurgencies reduces the possibility of losing Thai
territory]{.underline} and that permanent cease-fires reduce [military
casualties]{.underline} and make it easier for the armed forces to
recruit. [U.S.]{.underline} officials also could [emphasize that peace
deals]{.underline}, like the one in Aceh and the one proposed in the
southern Philippines, [usually allow for significant economic
development in ethnic-minority areas]{.underline}. Army officers with
extensive knowledge of these minority regions could benefit from this
economic development.

#### Interoperability ensures Thailand dependence on US, forcing Thailand to comply.

**[Prasirtsuk 17]{.underline}** (Kitti Prasirtsuk IS. Chapter Title: An
Ally at the Crossroads: Thailand in the US Alliance System. Comparing US
Alliances in the 21st Century. Global Allies. MICHAEL WESLEY. ANU Press.
(2017). Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1sq5twz.11)

Though the developments discussed above may seem pessimistic, there are
several promising factors for the future of the US--Thailand alliance.
First, [Thailand continues to have deep and long cooperation with the
United States, particularly in terms of interoperability]{.underline}.
[China is no match in this regard]{.underline}. [Regular military
exercises and various forms of military cooperation have ultimately
quietly and firmly institutionalised the US-- Thailand
alliance]{.underline}. Military-to-military relations remain robust with
more than 50 joint US--Thailand exercises annually. Between 2001 and
2009, the total number of military exercises increased from 44 to 59,
seven of which are multilateral.21 Cobra Gold is not the only
large-scale military exercise, but also Cope Tiger, the Red Flag
(previously Cope Thunder), and CARAT (Cooperation Afloat Readiness and
Training).

While originally focusing on the navy, [these bilateral exercises have
expanded to cover the army and air force.]{.underline} [The Americans
also benefit from conducting exercises in different terrain. In recent
years, the exercises increasingly focus on counterterrorism,
counterinsurgency, civil affairs, peacekeeping and, importantly,
humanitarian assistance]{.underline}.22 US--Thai military relations can
be attributed to the role of the Joint US Military Advisory Group
Thailand (JUSMAGTHAI), which has been active in various schemes of
military cooperation, particularly military exercises, humanitarian and
counter-drug missions. In fact, JUSMAGTHAI organises one of the largest
International Military Education and Training (IMET) programs for
Thailand and a number of cadets will be sent to study in the United
States each year. Likewise, American military officers are sent to
Thailand's Command and General Staff Academy. The socialization is
helpful in pursuing more cooperation. Apart from the
military-to-military relations, [Thailand and the United States engage
in bilateral strategic dialogue.]{.underline}

Second, [Thailand is a workable partner. Thanks to the interoperability
accumulated through years of military exercises, training and equipment
purchase, a number of new cooperation initiatives are
proceeding]{.underline}. In response to the increasing terrorism threats
following the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001,
Thailand has been host to a new multilateral naval exercise called
SEACAT (South-East Asia Cooperation Against Terrorism) since 2002. This
exercise aims to police South-East Asia's sea lanes for maritime
terrorism and piracy. Importantly, Thailand's cooperation with the
United States in arresting Hambali, a key Al-Qaeda member, in 2003
highlights the ability of the two countries to work effectively on
non-traditional security issues.

[Moreover, Thailand and the United States reached an agreement in late
2002 to create a war reserve stockpile,23 the first US stockpile outside
of NATO territories and South Korea.24 This demonstrates a part of the
cooperation under the non-NATO alliance.]{.underline}

Third, [the areas of shared interests between the United States and
Thailand remain considerable, specifically on regional stability and
nontraditional security. The United States remains the most important
actor in maintaining regional stability. Thailand relies on stable
regional order to develop its country. So do other regional
countries.]{.underline} Any cooperation toward that goal would be
welcome. Admittedly, however, it may be harder to mutually agree on the
appropriate kind of cooperation, and its extent, that would lead to
regional stability.

In this regard, cooperation is increasingly focused more on
non-traditional security, including drugs, terrorism and insurgency, all
of which are important threats to Thailand. Here, information and
intelligence sharing is crucial. In 2012, following a US travel warning,
several bombs exploded in Thailand. Since then, the US army has been
assisting Thailand in developing bomb-disposal skills.25 Meanwhile,
Thailand has played a role in peacekeeping operations and HADR, both of
which will raise the country's international profile. This is
particularly true after its successful involvement in the peace
processes in Cambodia and Timor-Leste. The frequent occurrence of
disasters in the region also motivated Thailand to play a more active
role in this area. As [the United States continues to be a key
player]{.underline} in such activities, there is room for joint
operation, particularly on HADR. Finally, Thailand traditionally tends
to diversify ties with major powers. Accordingly, sour relations with
the United States can be only temporary during this military government.
Once Thailand returns to electoral democracy, scheduled for 2018,
[bilateral relations should improve.]{.underline}

#### US- Thai relations \> Thai- China relations.

**[Prasirtsuk 17]{.underline}** (Kitti Prasirtsuk IS. Chapter Title: An
Ally at the Crossroads: Thailand in the US Alliance System. Comparing US
Alliances in the 21st Century. Global Allies. MICHAEL WESLEY. ANU Press.
(2017). Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1sq5twz.11)

Yet, [the relationship with China]{.underline} does not
[have]{.underline} only upsides, but also [downsides, including economic
threats]{.underline} from Chinese capitalists [as well as China's
assertiveness]{.underline}, especially with regard to the South China
Sea. Thailand's high expectation of China's generosity could be
disappointed. Thailand cannot rely too heavily on China, but has to
resort to the familiar strategy of hedging and diversifying ties with
major powers. Meanwhile[, there are quite a few upsides in the
US--Thailand alliance. Military-to-military interactions with the United
States remain intact, thanks to a half-century of institutionalized
relationships and interoperability. Thailand also has converging
interests with the United States on regional stability and
non-traditional security. HADR emerged as a promising field for
cooperation between the two nations.]{.underline}

### 2NC Solvency -- Philippines

#### U.S. is indirectly sponsoring Duterte's War on Terror thru military aid. 

[**Jackson 19** (Janine Jackson,]{.underline} FAIR's program director
and producer/host of FAIR's syndicated weekly radio show CounterSpin.
She contributes frequently to FAIR's newsletter Extra!, and co-edited
The FAIR Reader: An Extra! Review of Press and Politics in the '90s
(Westview Press). She has appeared on ABC's Nightline and CNN Headline
News, among other outlets, and has testified to the Senate
Communications Subcommittee on budget reauthorization for the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting, "The War on Drugs is Just One of
Several Being Waged in the Philippines,"
<https://fair.org/home/the-war-on-drugs-is-just-one-of-several-being-waged-in-the-philippines/>)

As of December, more than 5,000 people have been slain because of
Duterte's war on drugs, according to officials. That number, however, is
significantly lower than the estimate given by human rights groups,
which put the casualties at closer to 12,000, or even 20,000.

Note the passivity of the phrase "have been slain," and the choice to
lead with an official death toll rather than human rights groups' less
self-interested numbers. The 12,000 figure provides a link to a Human
Rights
Watch [report](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/01/18/philippines-dutertes-drug-war-claims-12000-lives) that
has never been the subject of a Washington Post news story.

Among many things such reporting wouldn't lead you to suspect: Two years
ago, when the Philippines Senate tried to cut funding for the campaign
of state and state-sanctioned violence, for which the toll of "even
20,000" is almost certainly conservative, it was the United States that
stepped in with the money to fill the shortfall. That's a direct line
from your tax dollars to the leader who said:

Hitler massacred 3 million Jews.... There's 3 million drug addicts.
There are. I'd be happy to slaughter them.

Corporate media don't talk much about the Philippines, much less about
the US role and responsibility there. A
recent [piece](https://fpif.org/its-time-to-end-u-s-military-aid-to-the-philippines/) from Foreign
Policy in Focus, headlined "It's Time to End US Military Aid to the
Philippines," filled some of that void. We'll hear from its author,
Mellon/ACLS public fellow Amee Chew, and hear also from two Filipino
activist/organizers, Ed Cubelo and Mong Palatino.

That's all coming up and we're going to get straight to it. You're
listening to CounterSpin, brought to you each week by the media watch
group FAIR.

[With his attacks on the poor and vulnerable, his disdain for
international law, his assault on press freedom and his personal
meanness, Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte should not be completely
unrecognizable to Americans.]{.underline} But [US media take little
interest]{.underline} in Duterte, even [as his "war on drugs" racks up a
death toll of human beings in the tens of thousands]{.underline}, making
the crisis seem to be something happening in a faraway land.

But our next guest reminds us that the human rights crisis unfolding in
[the Philippines actually has quite a bit to do with US actions and
aid]{.underline}. Amee Chew is a Mellon/ACLS public fellow;
her [article](https://fpif.org/its-time-to-end-u-s-military-aid-to-the-philippines/),
"It's Time to End US Military Aid to the Philippines," appeared
in Foreign Policy in Focus, among other outlets. She joins us now by
phone from the Bay Area. Welcome to CounterSpin, Amee Chew.

Amee Chew: Thank you. \
JJ: US news consumers may have heard about a "crackdown," or a "War on
Drugs," under Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, a war that "features
extrajudicial killings," as the Washington Post rather dryly [put
it](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/03/12/duterte-insulted-crazy-women-an-event-honor-women-hes-said-worse/?utm_term=.9e737fb0822d).
For those who have only a vague sense that Duterte is taking a "hard
line" toward "drug dealers"---or "trying to fight criminality,"
one AP [report](https://www.apnews.com/a71174af6257471d9ec4d814a41a69f6) had
it---how would you describe the scale and the nature of the killings, of
the drug war, and what measures of accountability or transparency exist
to even keep track of it all?

AC: Yes, well, so as of December 2018, [the Philippine Commission on
Human
Rights [estimated](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/19/dutertes-philippines-drug-war-death-toll-rises-above-5000) that
as many as 27,000 people have been killed due to Duterte's drug
war]{.underline}.
[And [police](https://www.nst.com.my/news/2016/12/195009/philippine-police-murdered-mayor-investigators) have
officially claimed responsibility for 5,100 people who they have killed
in anti-drug operations]{.underline}. The rest of the killings might
be [perpetrated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/in-dutertes-drug-war-rare-evidence-of-a-police-role-in-the-killing/2016/12/06/3a89d830-b6ee-11e6-9fa1-ff5eb54db157_story.html?utm_term=.0f6011cd8006) by
police as well as vigilantes. These are summary executions, where police
will be doing house-by-house operations, busting into people's houses
and shooting people, or vigilantes will be riding on motorbikes and
killing people on the street.

[It's important to note that Duterte has been inciting
them.]{.underline} In his campaign,
[he [promised](http://time.com/4462352/rodrigo-duterte-drug-war-drugs-philippines-killing/) to
kill 100,000 people in the first six months of office, and dump them
into Manila Bay. When he got into office,
he [told](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/793794/duterte-tells-cops-will-die-for-you-if-you-fulfill-your-duty) police
that "If you kill 1,000 people by doing your duty, I'll protect
you."]{.underline} Police have really [stepped
up](https://theintercept.com/2019/03/20/rodrigo-duterte-ibm-surveillance/) their
drug operations since he's been in office.

And there's actually
been [reports](https://www.amnestyusa.org/reports/if-you-are-poor-you-are-killed-extrajudicial-executions-in-the-philippines-war-on-drugs/),
by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, that police are [being
paid](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/05/19/dispatches-philippines-pay-hit-police) rewards
to kill people. This is an unofficial policy; it's not publicly
acknowledged. But there are witnesses [coming
forward](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/philippines-president-duterte-war-on-drugs-thousands-killed) about
this.

And vigilantes who are perpetrating killings are also closely associated
with the police. It's
been [documented](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/philippines-secret-death-squads-police-officer-teams-behind-killings) that
some have reported being hired by police; witnesses
have [noticed](https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/03/02/17/cops-abused-power-in-dutertes-drug-war-human-rights-watch-report) collaboration.

JJ: Duterte was always clear that it was drug dealers and
drug *users* whose bodies he was going to dump in Manila Bay, right? He
wasn't really making a fine distinction there, that people might be
thinking.

AC: Right. The people being killed include former users, people who no
longer use drugs, people who are users, and small petty dealers have
been gone after. And most people are from poor communities; they're
almost all low-income people, very low-income people.

Just to say on a personal level, it's at the point where most people I
know in Manila know someone who has been affected, whether it's an
acquaintance, a family member or friend.

Just an example of some of the cases, there was a 17-year-old student,
by the name Kian Delos Santos, he became a source of national protest,
because for the first time, police
were [captured](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/08/kian-loyd-delos-santos-17-killed-drug-crackdown-170818131943660.html) on
CCTV cameras, showing that they were dragging him. And they later
executed him. So the police claim that he drew a gun on them, and that's
the common story to justify all these killings, that the person fought
back, they had a weapon. But because of the footage, people were able to
press for these officers to be brought
to [trial](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-drugs-court/philippine-court-jails-three-police-officers-for-drugs-war-murder-idUSKCN1NY081),
actually. So he was a young person who was killed.

And there are many cases. There was a 14-year-old, Reynaldo de Guzman,
who
was [stabbed](https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/09/11/17/reynaldo-was-tortured-killed-then-stabbed-25-times-forensic-analyst) over
26 times and tortured. His body was found in a creek in 2017. I know
someone who both of their parents were killed.

So there's a very large dragnet, in terms of who is being affected, and
also a real climate of fear in these communities; people
are [afraid](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-drugs/as-bodies-pile-up-in-philippines-many-fear-to-talk-about-dutertes-war-idUSKCN11A15P)to
come forward about it, because they're afraid they could be next.
There's a political element to some of these killings, because some of
the people killed have been local elected government officials, and so
forth.

JJ: And, of course, beyond the fatalities, we also have lots of folks in
prison, including pretrial detainees.

I[t's often isolated in US press coverage, but of course, as you're just
starting to say, the "drug war" in the Philippines comes in a broader
context.]{.underline} And for that context, we were able to hear from
two Filipino activist/organizers.

Mong Palatino was a former two-term Filipino congressperson representing
the youth sector. And he's now Metro Manila chair of the
group [BAYAN](https://www.facebook.com/bayanmetromanila2018/). He had
this to say:

Mong Palatino: I think it is important to highlight and remind our
friends in the US that [the human rights situation in the Philippines is
worse than is depicted by media]{.underline}. So more than the drug war,
[Duterte has
been [waging](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/01/30/1889345/military-unleashes-air-strikes-onsulu-after-dutertes-all-out-war-order) an
all-out war against suspected communist rebels.]{.underline}
He [[declared](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-security/philippine-congress-extends-mindanao-martial-law-until-end-2019-idUSKBN1OB0IR) martial
law in Mindanao]{.underline}. He's [jailing critics]{.underline}. He is
[filing trumped-up cases against activists]{.underline}. And then the
extrajudicial killings have targeted, not just drug suspects, but also
activists, human rights lawyers, environmentalists and church leaders.
So it is important to highlight that the deterioration of the human
rights situation is linked to the rising resistance in the Philippines
against the repressive government of Duterte.

JJ: We also got context from [Ed
Cubelo](https://www.workers.org/2019/04/18/modern-day-heroes-filipino-workers-battle-repression/),
vice chair of the Philippines' [May First
Movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5&v=COuc_6vI_wQ);
here he's translated by Mong Palatino:

Ed Cubelo:  In particular, to the situation of Filipino workers, whose
situation is not adequately reported by mainstream media in the
Philippines, related to this is the demand of workers for adequate jobs
and living wages. Also the continuing attack of the government against
Filipino workers.

Filipino workers are facing greater hardships because of
contractualization. Filipino contractual workers cannot join unions,
cannot form unions, and their working conditions inside factories are
not safe. And if workers assert their rights, they are removed from
their jobs, or they are accused of supporting terrorist groups.

Also, I'd like to highlight the jailing of union leaders, the filing of
trumped-up cases against union organizers, and I hope this will reach
our friends in the US.

JJ: Amee Chew, another aspect of Duterte's repression of dissent---of
workers, of judges, of indigenous leaders---it's also included attacks
on the press, isn't that right?

AC: Yes, there's a really large number of journalists who
were [killed](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1013357/22-journalists-killed-in-ph-under-duterte-administration-nujp) in
the first two years under Duterte, which is the [highest
number](https://manilatoday.net/journalist-groups-decry-media-killings-attacks-on-press-freedom-in-sona-protest/) of
murdered journalists in the first two years of office of any Philippine
president.

And one really prominent case, too, besides these outright killings,
there's an indy
media [outlet](https://www.facebook.com/rapplerdotcom) called [Rappler](https://www.rappler.com/),
and the director of that outlet, [Maria
Ressa](http://time.com/5561018/philippines-maria-ressa-arrested-fraud/),
just has had constant arrest
warrants [issued](https://www.amnestyusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/uaa02019.pdf) against
her; I think she might be arrested right now. This is a form
of [harassment](http://time.com/5528416/maria-ressa-arrested-cyber-libel/),
because they are one of the few outlets to cover the war on drugs, as
well as other issues, from an indy media perspective.

But, yes, what's important to understand is that the war on drugs is
actually just one of several wars that are being waged in the
Philippines right now. And there are other wars of repression; they get
a lot less coverage in the US media, but they are also escalating.

So one is this attack on human
rights [defenders](https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/222796-human-rights-defenders-killed-under-duterte-administration) and [dissent](https://peoplesdispatch.org/2019/02/19/journalists-arrest-highlights-dutertes-war-against-dissent-in-the-philippines/) from
journalists, [environmentalists](https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/07/25/18/under-duterte-philippines-ranked-asias-most-dangerous-country-for-environment-defenders) to
labor [organizers](https://www.rappler.com/nation/211747-workers-strikes-result-duterte-policy-failure),  and
civil lawyers, human
rights [lawyers](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/philippines-human-rights-lawyer-shot-dead-negros-island-181107072451909.html),
there has been
an [increase](http://www.omct.org/files/2019/02/25257/philipppines_hrd_report_2019.pdf) in
killings.

Secondly, there's also an ongoing war against terrorism in the
Philippines, [especially](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/21/when-a-populist-demagogue-takes-power) in
the southernmost, largest island, called Mindanao, so this war on
terrorism has been going on for quite a while. There's
been [ongoing](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-17038024) civil wars
in Philippines, but under Duterte,
he [declared](https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/05/23/17/duterte-declares-martial-law-in-mindanao) martial
law in Mindanao in 2017. And there's been an escalation
of [bombings](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/instead-of-peace-indigenous-filipinos-get-the-duterte-treatment/2018/04/21/e52f24e2-3c31-11e8-974f-aacd97698cef_story.html) of
indigenous communities, people
being [displaced](https://www.karapatan.org/2018-Karapatan-HR-Report).
So that's going on as well.

I also just wanted to say that, in understanding the violence of the
police in the war on drugs, it's important to put it in context of the
relationship between the police and the military in the Philippines, and
also the role of the armed forces.

In the US, historically, the police came from slave catchers. But in the
Philippines, the police came out of counterinsurgency operations, from
the period of colonization and conquest under the Americans at the turn
of the century. They started a military police system called the
Philippine Constabulary, and to this day, the police and the military
work very closely together on essentially military operations that are
counterinsurgency operations.

Basically, when the US left the Philippines---or officially left it, by
giving it
formal [independence](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/philippine-independence-declared) in
1946---it created a highly unequal society through colonization, where
there is very concentrated land ownership under the landlord class, and
also a very big, landless peasantry. The economy in the Philippines has
been geared towards exports, whether that's export agriculture; today
it's exporting migrant labor, call center services.

The process of colonialism left this very big inequality, and constantly
since 1946, there's been movements against that. There's been peasant
insurgencies, there's been civil wars, there's been several separatist
movements. And the US has always played a role in backing the elitist
government and repressing these movements. And so today, we have a
situation where the main role of the armed forces is not about defending
the Philippines from outside invaders; it's about continuing these wars
against people within the Philippines.

And it's really an ongoing legacy of this unfinished colonial project,
especially when you look in Mindanao. Like, who is being targeted? It's
these Moro Muslim and indigenous communities, that historically have
been the last footholds of resistance against Spanish and US
colonization. And now these indigenous lands, which are some of the last
places to be opened up to multinational mining and logging corporations,
people have been resisting against that. And that's part of why the
communities are being targeted.

JJ: And in some ways, it seems as though the United States has never
left. You've traced the history, but to be clear, what is the current
role of the US, and particularly of US military aid, or aid to the
Duterte government?

AC: [Military aid is absolutely critical in providing Duterte weapons,
ammunition, surveillance technology, and bolstering his military
modernization programs. Duterte's regime is the [largest
recipient](https://philippineslifestyle.com/military-aid-usa-philippines/) of
US military aid in \[East and Southeast\] Asia, and he has massively
increased his own military spending, like doubled the salaries of police
and military.]{.underline} His whole program is about increasing the
power of the police and military even more.

For example, just last year, US
military [aid](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2018-11/lig-oco-opep-0918.pdf) to
the Philippines totaled at least \$193.5 million, not including arms
sales and donated equipment of unreported worth. About as much is
pledged for this year.

So this amount may not seem like that much compared to the US's own
bloated military budget. But it's actually a very tremendous transfer of
weapons and surveillance technology, that's significant when it comes to
propping up the Philippine armed forces capacity.

And then, meanwhile, [there's also a US troop presence in the
Philippines]{.underline}, there's up to as many as 5,000 troops deployed
in the Philippines at any one time, purportedly for war games, but also
overseeing this counterterrorism campaign in the south.

[There's also [unequal military
agreements](https://internationalpeoplestribunaldotorg.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/international-peoples-tribunal-ipt-2015-final-verdict.pdf)]{.underline},
longstanding ones, [like the Visiting Forces Agreement and the newer
Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement]{.underline}, t[hat allow the US
access to building military bases]{.underline} since we got [kicked
out](https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/28/world/philippines-orders-us-to-leave-strategic-navy-base-at-subic-bay.html) in
1992. Actually, the [People's
movement](https://www.ndfp.org/sayt/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/NDFP-CASER-2017-Web-version-Ver2.0.pdf) in
the Philippines kicked out US bases, but this is a way of getting around
that. And then the Visiting Forces Agreement, essentially, makes it very
hard to hold US troops accountable when they perpetuate human rights
violations, whether that's murder or [sexual
assault](https://books.google.com/books?id=u2HvCgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA90&ots=CIuNLhDOI3&dq=nicole%20subic%20bay%20settlement&pg=PA89#v=onepage&q=nicole%20subic%20bay%20settlement&f=false).

[So we give a significant amount of aid, and then there's actually a
significant amount directly to the police]{.underline}; of the figure I
quoted,
we [gave](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/07/27/1607298/us-pledges-32m-philippine-law-enforcement) \$33
million in aid to the Philippine police, plus \$18 million to them in
arms sales. And so [we've been giving [5 million rounds of
ammunition](https://ph.usembassy.gov/us-government-provides-millions-of-rounds-of-ammunition-to-the-armed-forces-of-the-philippines/) last
year, 2,253 machine guns, besides other surveillance equipment and
weapons.]{.underline}

And when you look at the expenses, like, for example, a big expense in
the war on terror is so-called [aerial surveillance and reconnaissance
technologies](https://thediplomat.com/2017/09/us-deploys-new-surveillance-drone-to-philippines-for-terror-fight/).
There has been an increase in bombings in Mindanao under Duterte. So
hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced by militarization,
and Duterte has [dropped
bombs](https://www.karapatan.org/2018-Karapatan-HR-Report) on
Philippines soil, impacting over 368,000 people.

JJ: So when we read those news reports, we should be connecting that
directly to what our taxpayer dollars are funding.

We asked Ed Cubelo and Mong Palatino what role the international
community and folks in the US could play in the work for social justice
in the Philippines. Here's Ed Cubelo:

Ed Cubelo: The role of the international community is significant,
especially here in the US, in adding pressure to the government about
the protection of human rights in the Philippines.

It's not just enough to inform people about the situation in the
Philippines; we need to remind the government, legislators and other
institutions in the US and other countries about the situation of
workers in the Philippines, and how workers are being repressed who are
simply asserting their rights.

On December 10, Filipinos held rallies in key cities around the country
to commemorate Human Rights Day and blast the administration of Benigno
Aquino III for the country's dismal human rights situation.

Millions of Filipinos fell victim to Typhoon Haiyan (also known as
Typhoon Yolanda). The affected regions already faced immense poverty.
Supporting these victims is a daunting task that has not been made any
easier by the Aquino administration's crackdown on human rights
defenders that serve these communities.

[The Alliance for the Advancement of People's Rights]{.underline}
(Karapatan), a human rights group in the Philippines, [has already
documented [six extrajudicial killings in
2014](http://www.karapatan.org/Karapatan+enraged+by+weekly+killing+spree+under+BS+Aquino)]{.underline}. [According
to Karapatan](http://www.karapatan.org/Karapatan+Monitor+2013+Issue2),
from July 2010 to August 2013 there were [152 extrajudicial killings,
eighteen enforced disappearances, eighty instances of torture and 168
unsuccessful assassination attempts]{.underline}.

The headlines are focusing on the [recent peace
agreement](http://www.economist.com/news/asia/21595500-long-running-insurgency-may-last-be-coming-end-fragile-peace) between
the central government in Manila and separatists in Mindanao, but [the
US press in particular has largely ignored these human rights
violations]{.underline}, which are taking place in an increasingly
militarized environment. [Both the Philippine government and the United
States have used the maritime disputes with China and the alleged
prevalence of terrorists on the islands [as a
pretext](http://karapatan.org/%2440M+%E2%80%93US+military+aid%2C+bane+to+rights+and+sovereignty+of+Filipino+people+-+Karapatan) to
justify US support for the Philippine military as well as additional US
troop presence in the area. ]{.underline}[The humanitarian
disaster](http://www.karapatan.org/Goldberg+US+troops+Yolanda+humanitarian+aid+framework+agreement) created
by the typhoon has also provided an opening for the militaries of both
countries to amplify their role at the expense of civilian actors.

President Aquino's predecessor, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, had a policy of
eliminating all forms of opposition.

In 2002, as part of the US-initiated "global war on terror," [the
Philippine government launched the counterinsurgency plan]{.underline}
Oplan Bantay Laya (Operation Freedom Watch), a
holistic [approach](http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Update_of_Report_lq.pdf) to
counterinsurgency aimed at all manner of opposition activists in the
country. The plan made no distinction between armed combatants and
civilians. [Regions where the plan was implemented saw escalating
numbers of civilian killings, including many members of leftist popular
organizations that the government alleged to be "Communist
fronts."]{.underline} The attacks were not limited to political party
activists but extended to [lawyers and
judges](http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/philippines0711WebRevised.pdf) who
had been involved in human rights work or cases where government
interests were at stake.

[Killings of other government critics similarly escalated.]{.underline}
Between 2001 and 2007, [hundreds of activists with progressive
organizations were murdered, including trade union leaders, human rights
activists, journalists, church workers, indigenous leaders, civilians,
farm workers and peasant leaders.]{.underline}
In [2006](http://www.karapatan.org/2006-HR-report), the worst year for
human rights since the toppling of the right-wing Marcos regime in the
1980s, the Philippine military and its paramilitary death squads killed
an average of one activist every thirty-six hours.

In February 2007, the Philippine government's investigative task force
issued the report of the [Melo
Commission](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_killings_in_the_Philippines_(2001%E2%80%9310)#Melo_Commission),
a body formed under pressure from domestic and international rights
advocates in response to the grave human rights situation. The
commission noted that victims were generally unarmed, alone or in small
groups, and were gunned down by two or more masked or hooded assailants,
often riding motorcycles. Further, the commission admitted there was
evidence that implicated members of the armed forces, in particular Gen.
Jovito Palparan, for allowing, tolerating and even ordering an
undetermined number of killings. Although the task force absolved the
administration of committing human rights abuses, it nonetheless
concluded that "this does not mean the State can sit idly by and refuse
to act. Ultimately, the State has the responsibility of protecting its
citizens and making sure that their fundamental liberties are
respected."

The Supreme Court called for the establishment of [ninety-nine special
courts](http://web.archive.org/web/20070708181922/http:/newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view_article.php?article_id=75094) to
prosecute the killings by June 2007. The Arroyo government created
several investigative bodies, including the Melo Commission. But human
rights groups in the Philippines have suspected that the government was
using these mechanisms merely to exonerate the military and police
perpetrators. Despite statements of concern as well as reports by the UN
(including findings by the Human Rights Committee), human rights
organizations, [international
observers](http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Karapatan_Monitor_Issue2_2013_WEB.pdf) and
the Arroyo government's own commission, the killings continued unabated,
and victims and their families were left
without [justice](http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/13-02-06_AMP_trumped-up-charges-just-another-means-of-political-repression_wolf.pdf).

[The Philippine government continues to commit human rights violations
with impunity]{.underline}. According
to [Karapatan](http://karapatan.org/), [President Aquino's]{.underline}
implementation of the [counterinsurgency program]{.underline} Oplan
Bayanihan (Operation Shoulder to Shoulder) [has]{.underline} thus far
[resulted in 152 documented cases of extrajudicial killings, 168
attempted killings, eighteen instances of forced disappearance, eighty
cases of torture, 608 cases of illegal arrest and more than 30,000
forced evacuations.]{.underline}

General Palparan [faces a 2011 warrant of
arrest](http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/01/31/philippines-arrest-ex-general-accused-disappearances) from
a Bulacan court for his involvement in the 2006 disappearance of two
student activists in Central Luzon. He is still in hiding, probably with
the assistance of the Philippine armed forces. Palparan is regarded as
the key implementer of Oplan Bantay Laya and was promoted by Arroyo at
the height of the extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances.

The promotion of military generals who are known human rights violators
is an indication of the persistent climate of impunity under the Aquino
administration. The military, private armies and paramilitary
units [silence independent media
outlets](http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/545429/killing-of-journalists-a-natl-catastrophe) and
journalists with impunity. Journalists face rampant vandalism of their
offices, constant intimidation and surveillance, and abduction and
killings. In December 2013, Rogelio Butalid, a block-timer for 107.9 FM
Radyo Natin, was shot dead by a lone killer in Tagum City in Davao del
Norte province shortly after he finished his radio program. That same
month, radioman Michael Milo was gunned down in Tandag City in Surigao
del Sur province.

T[his has also affected US citizens active in Philippine
solidarity]{.underline}, as evidenced by [the 2009 abduction and torture
of BAYAN USA member and Filipina-American activist Melissa
Roxas]{.underline} by the Philippine military. Roxas has [filed
complaints](http://justiceformelissa.org/press/) with the US State
Department and the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, in addition to
exhausting the domestic court system in the Philippines.

[Lawyers and human rights groups providing counsel to activists
imprisoned on trumped-up charges have become targets of repression
themselves]{.underline}. They are [subject to extrajudicial killings,
violent harassment, illegal detention and surveillance by a state
apparatus keen to silence dissent]{.underline}. For example, Army chief
Lt. Gen. Noel Coballes recently named the human rights organization
Karapatan an "[enemy of the
state](http://www.businessweekmindanao.com/2013/07/16/army-chief-marks-rights-defenders-as-enemies-of-the-state/)"
for its objection to the promotion of Brig. Gen. Aurelio Baladad.
Baladad faces a string of credible charges, including the illegal arrest
of forty-three community health workers in a dawn raid in Morong by a
swarm of Philippine Army and police personnel just before Arroyo's term
ended.

According to the National Union of People's Lawyers (NUPL), which has
been at the forefront of efforts to legally challenge government
repression, "This statement from a top military official is dangerous
and betrays what various organizations and concerned groups have said
all along, that the present counterinsurgency program Oplan Bayanihan is
no different from the deadly Oplan Bantay Laya."

Leaders of people's organizations are also [facing criminal
charges](http://www.philstar.com/metro/2013/08/01/1036741/militant-groups-sued-over-sona-protest)over
a protest held during President Aquino's State of the Nation address
last July. According to NUPL, in the course of negotiating with police
representatives for a resolution to the impasse, the police suddenly
attacked protesters, hurting scores of people---including the NUPL
secretary general.

[The Philippines]{.underline}, a US colony for the first half of the
twentieth century, [is considered a key strategic partner for US
economic and strategic interests.]{.underline} The large Subic and Clark
military bases, for example, played a key role in the Vietnam War. In
return, from 1972 to 1986, the United States supported the Marcos
military dictatorship with massive economic and military aid.

In the mid-1980s, the Philippine people ousted Marcos and enacted a
new [constitution](http://www.lawphil.net/consti/cons1987.html) that
banned "foreign military bases, troops, or facilities" unless duly
ratified by Congress or a national referendum. In 1991, the Philippine
government banned all permanent foreign bases from its soil, and in
1992, the last American base closed down after relentless street
protests and campaigning.

But in 1998, [Washington and Manila signed a [Visiting Forces Agreement
(VFA),](http://ph.news.yahoo.com/blogs/the-inbox/us-access-talks-pr-173054297.html) which
allowed the United States to establish twenty-two "semi-permanent" bases
in the archipelago]{.underline} to get around the ban that opposition to
US bases had prompted. Former US ambassador to the Philippines Thomas
Hubbard signed the VFA as an executive agreement rather than a treaty,
eliminating the need for the advice and consent of the US Senate.
Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon signed the VFA on behalf of the
Philippines, and the Philippine Senate ratified the agreement.

After the 9/11 attacks, President Arroyo was one of the first heads of
state to [pledge
support](http://www.bulatlat.com/news/4-31/4-31-911.html) to President
George W. Bush's "war on terror." Since 2002, the Joint Special
Operations Task Force Philippines, which comprises about 500 members of
the US military, has been stationed at a "temporary" base in the
southern Philippines. [Constitutional
challenges](http://manilastandardtoday.com/2013/02/14/remedies-for-the-rape-of-tubbataha/) to
the VFA by human rights lawyers have been thus far unsuccessful. On June
27, 2013, Philippine Defense Minister Voltaire Gazmin and his Japanese
counterpart announced that the Philippines would be establishing basing
arrangements with both the United States and Japan, which would increase
the US troop presence in the Philippines. Human rights lawyers quickly
pointed out that the arrangement would circumvent [the constitution and
the
VFA](http://www.humanrightsphilippines.net/2013/07/human-rights-lawyers-vow-to-file-and-support-legal-actions-to-stop-rp-us-japan-access-arrangement/).

In early November, disagreements between US and Filipino
negotiators [prolonged](http://www.10news.com/news/military/philippines-us-disagree-in-talks-to-escalate-american-troop-deployments11052013) the
talks on the increased American troop presence. But after Typhoon
Haiyan, both Manila and Washington are justifying more US troops as part
of humanitarian aid missions, and [negotiations are back on
track](http://www.voanews.com/content/philippines-us-typhoon-response-shows-need-for-finalizing-military-treaty/1797022.html).

[The Philippines]{.underline}, one of the closest US allies in Asia, [is
crucial to the [Obama administration's "pivot" to
Asia](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/18/us-philippines-typhoon-pivot-idUSBRE9AH12L20131118),
which aims to counter the rising influence of China on the world
stage]{.underline}. The United States provided more than [\$507
million](http://globalnation.inquirer.net/16777/us-has-given-philippines-over-507m-in-military-aid-says-thomas) in
military assistance to the Philippines from 2001 to 2010. [After
pressure from human rights groups inside the Philippines---which were
supported by international efforts to bring attention to extrajudicial
killings, disappearances and other human rights violations---US military
aid decreased and the United States withheld the release of some
military financing]{.underline}. A March 2007 Senate hearing resulted in
the [cutting of a
portion](http://www.laborrights.org/end-violence-against-trade-unions/philippines/military-aid-to-the-philippines) of
the 2008 Foreign Military Financing package to the Armed Forces of the
Philippines due to the latter's involvement in human rights abuses.

American funding was down to \$11.9 million in 2011. [It is on the rise
again, however, and along with it there has been a dramatic increase in
human rights violations against activists]{.underline}, many of whom are
farmworkers, peasants and indigenous people opposed to the incursions of
multinational corporations and the theft of their land. The most [recent
incident
happened](http://www.karapatan.org/Karapatan+enraged+by+weekly+killing+spree+under+BS+Aquino) on
February 5, when two unidentified men onboard a red motorcycle shot and
killed 41-year-old peasant leader Julieto Lauron, who was with organizer
Nermie Lapatis on their way to the village of Haindangon, Valencia City.
Lapatis had recently moved to Valencia City because of threats against
her life. As an organizer among indigenous peoples in Bukidnon, Lapatis
campaigned against the entry of large-scale mining companies in the
area, earning the ire of the military and paramilitary groups.

[[Military aid in
2012](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/03/us-philippines-usa-idUSBRE8420IU20120503) rose
to \$30 million, and the Philippine foreign ministry recently announced
that the United States has increased the [military assistance
package](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/31/us-philippines-usa-idUSBRE96U0IG20130731) to
about \$50 million for the next fiscal year]{.underline}. This comes

recently appointed US ambassador to the Philippines. Together, [these
developments signal the US government's renewed support for [Oplan
Bayanihan](http://www.karapatan.org/Aquino+Oplan+Bayanihan+failure+waste+of+people%27s+money),
the Aquino administration's latest attempt to end a forty-five-year-old
insurgency led by the Communist Party of the Philippines and its armed
wing, the New People's Army (NPA).]{.underline} Oplan Bayanihan has
adopted a similar framework and similar techniques to Oplan Bantay Laya,
and has led to human rights violations. These techniques
include smearing all opposition activists as Communists and treating
them no differently than the NPA.

[Systematic human rights violations are also being committed in the very
same places where foreign interests are currently operating or exploring
new ventures in highly destructive industries such as open-pit mining,
cash-crop agriculture, oil and gas extraction and logging.]{.underline}
For example, Human Rights Watch has
documented [cases](http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2013/country-chapters/philippines?page=2)in
which critics of mining and energy projects have been killed, allegedly
by paramilitary forces under military control. The activists had been
vocal in opposing mining and energy operations that they said threatened
the environment and would displace tribal communities from their land.
These include the southern Philippine island of Mindanao, where [massive
amounts](http://therhsssnews.wordpress.com/2012/01/31/philippines-discover-deposits-of-oil-and-gas-in-mindanao/) of
oil and natural gas have been found. The island also plays host to
lucrative plantations for large corporations like Dole and Del Monte.
Karapatan reported in December that since President Aquino assumed power
in 2010, twenty-five people, most of them political activists and three
of them children, have
been [killed](http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/542635/25-activists-so-far-killed-in-southern-mindanao-under-aquino-karapatan) in
southern Mindanao.

[American military aid to the Philippines violates US laws regulating
aid to human rights-violating militaries]{.underline}. [The US Arms
Export Control Act, as well as the Leahy Law, stipulates that no funding
shall be furnished to foreign security forces if the United States has
knowledge that those forces have committed "a gross violation of human
rights.]{.underline}" Yet human rights violations committed by the
Philippine military do not currently affect the frequency or quantity of
US military aid provided to the Philippines.

[Human rights groups]{.underline} in the Philippines, such as Karapatan,
[have called for an end to US [military

"violates the sovereignty of the Philippines and perpetuates the culture
of impunity" for rights abusers.]{.underline}

As Americans, we must ask why the US government is sending millions of
taxpayer dollars to the Philippine military at the same time this
institution is committing systematic human rights violations. American
military involvement in the Philippines must end.

was [murdered](https://www.rappler.com/nation/222301-human-rights-groups-statements-death-ndf-consultant-randy-malayao) in
cold blood by armed hit men.

Ever since the Philippines attained formal independence in 1946[, the
U.S. has maintained a military presence on its former colony, guiding
and supporting "counter-insurgency" operations to put down constant
rebellions against an oligarchic government. Today]{.underline}, the
Philippine armed forces overwhelmingly direct violence not against
outside invaders, but at poor and marginalized people within its
borders. [U.S. military aid is only making internal conflict
worse.]{.underline}

[Duterte's repressive regime is
the [largest](http://philippineslifestyle.com/military-aid-usa-philippines/) [recipient](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/09/10/1850124/philippines-largest-recipient-us-military-aid) of
U.S.
military [aid](https://explorer.usaid.gov/agencies/?agency=7&year=2017&measure=Obligations) in
East and Southeast Asia.]{.underline}

In 2016, [the U.S. helped inaugurate Duterte's drug war by giving [\$32
million](http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/07/27/1607298/us-pledges-32m-philippine-law-enforcement) to
the Philippine police (supposedly for "[training and
services](http://www.rappler.com/nation/147196-us-funding-philippines-law-enforcement)"
in "policing standards" and "rule of law,"
besides [equipment](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2018-11/lig-oco-opep-0918.pdf)).]{.underline}
In July 2018, the United States announced an additional [\$26.5
million](https://ph.usembassy.gov/united-states-to-boost-counterterrorism-support-for-philippine-law-enforcement/) in
U.S. tax dollars to beef up support for Philippine police, in the name
of "counter-terrorism."

In FY2018, [the Defense Department provided [roughly \$100
million](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2019-02/OPEP_Q119_Dec2018_final.pdf) in
military aid, including equipment, weapons, and aerial surveillance
systems]{.underline}, to the Philippine military and police, though
Operation Pacific Eagle --- a so-called "overseas contingency operation"
that is [exempt](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R44519.pdf)from
congressional limits on spending. The amount demanded for this program
will increase to [\$108.2
million](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2019-02/OPEP_Q119_Dec2018_final.pdf) for
FY2019 --- even as the Defense Department
has [admitted](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2019-02/OPEP_Q119_Dec2018_final.pdf) it
lost track of transactions for 76 of 77 arms sales conducted under
bilateral agreements with the Philippines.

In 2018, on top of the above, [the U.S. sold the
Philippine [police](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2019-02/OPEP_Q119_Dec2018_final.pdf) and
[military](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2018-11/lig-oco-opep-0918.pdf) over
\$63 million worth of arms. It also donated [2,253 machine
guns](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2019-02/OPEP_Q119_Dec2018_final.pdf),
over [5
million](https://ph.usembassy.gov/us-government-provides-millions-of-rounds-of-ammunition-to-the-armed-forces-of-the-philippines/) rounds
of ammunition, surveillance equipment, and other weapons.]{.underline}
Military aid totaled at least \$193.5 million last
year, **[not]{.underline}**including arms sales, and donated equipment
of unreported worth. At least \$145.6 million is already pledged for
2019.

In January, Trump authorized \$1.5 billion annually for the Asian
Pacific region, including the Philippines, from 2019 to 2023. Although
this authorization includes
a [stipulation](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2736/text) that
counter-narcotics funds will **[not]{.underline}**go to the Philippines
("except for drug demand reduction," a potential loophole), it's too
little, too late. The set-aside has no restrictions on weapons funding
for the Philippine military. And separately, the State Department
already plans to deliver [\$5.3
million](https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/290302.pdf) this
year to the Philippine police for anti-narcotics activities. Worse,
rampant corruption together with a total lack of transparency means it's
hard to ensure where military aid could actually end up.

Although the above aid is tiny compared to the U.S.'s own bloated
military budget, this tremendous transfer of weapons and surveillance
technology is significant in propping up the Philippine armed forces'
capacity.

[Duterte has embarked on an ambitious program to "modernize" the
Philippine military]{.underline}, massively increasing funding and
pouring more money towards this than spent in [the last 15
years](https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2018/10/21/1861787/afp-budget-biggest-ever?fbclid=IwAR0KDcJItqxS3Cr1OstUNZRG-SXtaCzJ75rlLaRy0HQ1-pIAM7S46fYFiEQ).
(Meanwhile,
he's[doubled](https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/01/09/18/cops-soldiers-other-uniformed-personnel-to-begin-receiving-doubled-pay) the
salaries of military and police.) [He could not do so without U.S. aid
and arms.]{.underline}

For its part, [the U.S. is particularly interested
in [expanding](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2019-02/OPEP_Q119_Dec2018_final.pdf) aerial
"intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance" missions over
Mindanao]{.underline}, the largest island in the Southern Philippines,
rich in untapped mineral resources. Without U.S. aid, the Philippine
military would lack the airplanes and technology to perform this
surveillance.

What's more, this year's Operation Pacific Eagle budget sets aside an
extra [\$3.5
million](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2019-02/OPEP_Q119_Dec2018_final.pdf) for
U.S. military efforts to collect and analyze "local media in native
languages" --- underscoring that the U.S. is striving for an upper hand
in directing Philippine military operations. And in winning an
information war over public opinion.

I[n recent years, the U.S. has had up
to [5,000](https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/your-marine-corps/2018/08/09/pentagon-triples-military-spending-in-philippines/) troops
deployed in the Philippines at any one time. Officially, U.S. troops are
limited to "joint exercises" and war games.]{.underline} But questions
have been raised over [possible U.S.
personnel](https://www.manilatimes.net/us-soldier-among-dead/159838/) involvement
in secretive missions, resulting in killings of civilians and human
rights abuses.

In the case of the
2015 [Mamasapano](https://www.rappler.com/nation/82518-milf-fatalities-maguindanao-clash) [massacre](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/669237/moro-group-7-civilians-killed-3-wounded-in-mamasapano-clash#ixzz3QJi1rF9KF),
supposedly under the jurisdiction of Philippine police and military
only, hearings

U.S. [denials](https://www.mindanews.com/peace-process/2015/01/us-embassy-on-mamasapano-we-just-assisted-in-evacuation-of-dead-and-wounded/).
Meanwhile, U.S. troops who themselves commit human rights abuses,
murder, or [sexual
assault](https://books.google.com/books?id=u2HvCgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA90&ots=CIuNLhDOI3&dq=nicole%20subic%20bay%20settlement&pg=PA89#v=onepage&q=nicole%20subic%20bay%20settlement&f=false),
are insulated from being held accountable by the U.S.-Philippines
Visiting Forces Agreement.

The bottom line is, [the U.S. government is complicit in]{.underline}
--- and actively supporting --- [the deepening human rights crisis in
the Philippines.]{.underline}

[[Police

In addition to the drug war, [repression is unfolding on other
fronts]{.underline}, as well. [[Twelve

People's Lawyers]{.underline}, an attorney representing the Sagay 9 ---

2018, [14
massacres](https://www.karapatan.org/2018-Karapatan-HR-Report), killings
mostly of farmers who were fighting for land reform, were perpetrated by
police, military, or paramilitaries.

the drug war. Edilberto Miralles, president of R&E Taxi Transport union,
was[shot in broad

and attempted to suppress journalists' coverage of the dispersal.

Under Duterte,
over [134](https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/222796-human-rights-defenders-killed-under-duterte-administration) human
rights defenders have been killed. In just one case, in 2017, Elisa
Badayos and Eleuterio Moises
were [murdered](https://www.philstar.com/nation/2017/11/29/1763667/2-members-fact-finding-mission-negros-killed-1-injured)while
serving on a fact-finding team investigating human rights violations due
to militarization in Negros Oriental.

Since 2017, [Duterte has imposed martial law on Mindanao]{.underline}.
[Increasing militarization is resulting in rampant abuses against
indigenous and Moro people.]{.underline} Aerial "surveillance" missions
already make up the bulk of U.S. aid to the Philippine military. Most
likely in direct relation, bombings in Mindanao have escalated ---
particularly over indigenous lands, causing mass evacuations.
Simultaneously, reminiscent of U.S.-sponsored tactics in Latin America
resulting in indigenous genocide, the Philippine military, together
with [paramilitary
groups](https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/09/23/philippines-paramilitaries-attack-tribal-villages-schools) it [arms](https://www.icj.org/the-philippines-must-get-rid-of-its-militias-now/) and[guides](https://www.karapatan.org/AFP%2C+DND+asks+for+bigger+budget+to+fund+its+paramilitaries),
are terrorizing indigenous communities. The military has recruited and
even forced indigenous people to become paramilitaries as a means of
divide-and-conquer.

Indigenous groups' resistance is at the forefront of the struggle
against climate change, both in the Philippines and globally. Now, their
lands, such as those in Mindanao's Pantaron Range, are some of the [few
remaining](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bzc5SdETrPEAQjBkOXNLaXIzSEk/view) to
be opened up to extractive logging and mining by multinational
corporations. The militarization of indigenous lands, purportedly in the
name of counterinsurgency, seeks to quell this organized
community [opposition](https://intercontinentalcry.org/thousands-march-killings-indigenous-peoples-philippine-mining-capital/) to
corporate land-grabbing and environmental degradation.

Education is

well.

The military and paramilitaries are targeting
indigenous [community](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/07/11/1831716/lumad-schools-even-holding-class-struggle)[schools](http://ibon.org/2017/03/lumad-schools-under-attack-in-mineral-rich-mindanao/) ---
turning their grounds into military encampments, shooting teachers and
students, bombing the schools -- to force their closure. Indigenous
children and their teachers are the victims of this campaign.

In September 2017, Obello Bay-ao, a student at Salugpongan's school in
Dulyan, Talaingod,
was [killed ](https://www.karapatan.org/Two+members+of+paramilitary+group+charged+with+murder+of+Lumad+student+)by
Alamara paramilitaries while walking home from farming. He was shot 24
times in the back. In the same community, another 15-year-old student
was [gunned
down](https://news.abs-cbn.com/nation/regions/01/19/16/lumad-student-allegedly-killed-by-paramilitary-member) by

raped](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/719073/3-soldiers-tagged-in-rape-of-manobo-girl) by
soldiers in 2015.

In May 2018, Beverly Geronimo, a teacher of indigenous children,
was[gunned](https://www.bulatlat.com/2018/05/27/suspected-elements-25th-ibpa-murder-mother-misfi-student/) [down](http://davaotoday.com/main/human-rights/lumad-school-student-wounded-mother-shot-dead-in-agusan-del-sur/) in
Trento, Agusan del Sur while buying school supplies. In November 2018,
four teachers, Tema Namatidong, Julius Torregosa, Ariel Barluado, and
Giovanni Solomon,
were [abducted](http://www.chrp.org.uk/2018/two-weeks-in-mindanao-two-farmers-shot-four-teachers-abducted-five-students-tortured-and-a-family-assaulted-2/) by

In June
2018, [72](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/07/11/1831716/lumad-schools-even-holding-class-struggle) schools
were unable to hold classes because of military
harassment. [Over](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/scary-indigenous-schools-feel-heat-restive-mindanao-181211031536969.html) [2,000](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/07/11/1831716/lumad-schools-even-holding-class-struggle) indigenous
students could not attend school because of nearby military encampments.

The schools under attack are part of
a [movement](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/07/11/1831716/lumad-schools-even-holding-class-struggle) led
by indigenous groups, together with NGOs and church partners, to provide
relevant education for their youth, a service largely neglected by the
government.[Ninety
percent](https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2017/03/18/1679995/lumads-sustain-fight-save-their-schools) of
indigenous children lack access to formal education. In the 2000s,
indigenous
communities [established](https://www.bulatlat.com/2014/12/01/the-lumad-school-on-pantaron-range/) [schools](https://www.bulatlat.com/2015/10/21/alcadev-the-school-that-feeds-minds-and-communities/) in [conjunction](https://www.bulatlat.com/2018/12/01/context-of-talaingod-incident-the-decades-old-struggle-of-lumad-in-pantaron-mountain-range-for-ancestral-land-right-to-self-determination/)with
their struggles for self-determination, in hopes that education would
help protect them from land-grabbing. The military has sought to brand
community schools as "training camps" for communist insurgents, recently
launching Facebook campaigns towards this purpose.

U[.S. military aid is intensifying the conflict in Mindanao,
exacerbating its impact on civilians]{.underline}. U.S. [investment in
aerial surveillance will escalate an air war that has a brutal and
indiscriminate effect on people as well as the environment]{.underline}.
The integration of "intelligence" activity in counter-terrorism is
dangerous. [It will likely worsen repression against anyone organizing
for indigenous, labor, and human rights]{.underline} --- feeding a
growing bloodbath as paramilitaries are employed to undermine these
local struggles, while providing cover for government troops to escape
accountability.

Today's violence is inseparable from the U.S.'s imperial shadow. The
drug war is a purge of humans deemed worthless in a society where social
safety nets were never allowed to be developed, where the failure of
neoliberal economic reforms now plays into the hands of despotism, and
where U.S.-backed elites regularly employ state-paid goons to undermine
democracy.

Placed in historical context, Mindanao, and those lands of indigenous
communities under attack, were some of the last outposts resisting
Spanish and U.S. rule. The islands --- dubbed
by [Trump](https://www.newsweek.com/prime-piece-real-estate-trumps-verdict-philippines-711040) "a
prime piece of real estate from a military standpoint" --- have long
served as a stepping stone towards U.S. aspirations of dominance in the
Asia-Pacific. U.S. military aid continues a long process of
"pacification" --- and colonial conquest, now unfolding in neocolonial
forms.

[They demand also peace with justice]{.underline} --- [a peace process
that adopts structural reforms like those outlined
in [CASER](https://www.ndfp.org/sayt/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/NDFP-CASER-2017-Web-version-Ver2.0.pdf)]{.underline},
a program the NDFP sought to reach agreement on implementing via peace
talks, that includes land reform, rescinding neoliberal economic
policies, and respecting indigenous land and self-determination.

In 2016, [Sandugo](http://sandugo.org/), a historic alliance of
indigenous and Moro groups from across the Philippines, formed, uniting
for self-determination and a just peace. Three thousand delegates met in
Manila, and protesters converged on the [U.S.
embassy](https://truthout.org/articles/moro-and-indigenous-peoples-forge-historic-alliance-for-self-determination/),
under a banner calling for an end to U.S. intervention and
militarization. At the gates of the U.S. embassy, the Philippine police
responded by beating people indiscriminately, and a[police van ran over
the
crowd](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/philippines-police-van-rams-protesters-outside-us-embassy-in-manila),
injuring dozens.

Three years later, [the call to end U.S. military aid and lift martial
law continues.]{.underline}

In terms of the drug war, one of the first groups to come out in vocal
opposition was [Kadamay](https://www.facebook.com/kadamaynational/), a
mass-based organization of urban poor people. Instead of killings,
Kadamay has called for addressing poverty and the root causes of the
drug problem --- in short, for drug addiction to be treated as a health,
not criminal, issue. More recently, an organization of family members of
those killed in the drug war has formed, [Rise Up For Life and
Rights](https://www.facebook.com/Rise-Up-for-Life-and-for-Rights-363258137385786/).

When the Philippine Senate tried to [restrict
funding](https://www.rappler.com/nation/189915-philippine-senate-approves-2018-national-budget) for
Duterte's drug war in late 2017, the U.S. [stepped
in](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/07/20/1835100/philippines-receive-27-million-counterterror-aid-us) to
provide funds that filled the shortfall. To evade accountability,
Duterte
has [shifted](http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2017/11/30/Senate-2018-budget-slashes-drug-war-funds-from-PNP-DILG.html) drug
war operations from under the Philippine National Police (PNP) to the
Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency
and [back](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/12/05/1765784/pnp-back-drug-war-pdea-still-lead-agency) to
the PNP's general operation funds. Recently,
he [eliminated](http://nine.cnnphilippines.com/news/2018/08/30/PNP-drug-war-Oplan-Double-Barrel-budget.html) keeping
a separate budget item for the drug war --- obscuring how much money is
being expended on it. The Philippine Congress has not been able to
provide effective oversight.

[The continuing drug war killings and rampant human rights abuses only
underscore that there is no way to ensure U.S. military aid to the
Duterte regime does **not **enable human rights violations]{.underline}.
For its part, U[.S. military spending is not only overblown, but also
often untraceable, secretive, and unaccountable.]{.underline} From
Central America to Palestine to the Philippines, U.S. military aid has a
sordid legacy of fueling atrocities.

[Congress must exercise its powers to ensure the Leahy Law, which
stipulates no funding shall be furnished to foreign security forces if
the U.S. knows they have committed "a gross violation of human rights,"
is upheld with regard to the Philippines.]{.underline} (For more

In [2007](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-110shrg40811/html/CHRG-110shrg40811.htm),
due to movement pressure, Congress held a hearing
on [rising](https://www.thenation.com/article/how-us-aid-fosters-human-rights-violations-philippines/)extrajudicial
killings in the Philippines under Gloria Macapagal Arroyo's regime.
Legislation was passed placing restrictions on military aid. The next
year, killings decreased significantly.

Our time to act is now.

responded to any requests since May 2018, [the newspaper
reported](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jan/04/trump-administration-un-human-rights-violations),
and at least 13 requests have gone unanswered. A number of them are
related to the disastrous and monstrously cruel family separations
policy and the treatment of migrants at the US-Mexico border.

[As a general rule]{.underline}, Western, [developed countries tend to
cooperate with UN human rights rapporteurs while countries with terrible
human rights records are more likely to deny them access]{.underline}.
As the *Guardian *points out, North Korea is one of a handful of
countries that routinely denies access to UN probes. In 2017, Myanmar
also barred UN investigators from entering the country. Once again,
President Donald Trump finds himself in excellent company.

The *Guardian *report follows seven months after the US withdrew from
the UN Human Rights Council, which Nikki Haley, then the US ambassador
to the UN, said was a "hypocritical and self-serving organization that
makes a mockery of human rights".

[The two things may be directly related]{.underline}: [by withdrawing
from the Council, the US has less of an incentive to cooperate with its
special rapporteurs and investigators]{.underline}. But [both
decisions]{.underline} also [point to the Trump administration's broader
disregard for human rights]{.underline}, whether that's demonstrated
through its policies such as family separations at the border and
summary deportations, or through the president's rhetoric.

In the aftermath of the gruesome killing of the Saudi *Washington
Post*columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the hands of his own government,
[Trump [issued a
statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-donald-j-trump-standing-saudi-arabia/) making
clear that he considered maintaining lucrative arms contracts with the
Kingdom a bigger priority than sanctioning the state for killing a
journalist and a resident of the US.]{.underline} At best, Trump is
suggesting that human rights questions matter only as far as they don't
conflict with getting America a good deal, at worst he's implying they
don't matter to him at all.

For authoritarian leaders around the world, [Trump's presidency has been
a boon]{.underline} -- and not just for the likes of Vladimir Putin, Kim
Jong-un and Mohammed Bin Salman. [The pressure to cooperate with the UN
or to pay lip service to human rights is decreasing]{.underline}: after
all, the president of the United States threatened during his campaign
to "lock up" his democratic opponent, and routinely attacks the courts
and the press.

[Trump's impact worldwide is chilling in its immediacy]{.underline}.
Consider this, for instance, since Trump was elected to office the
number of journalists worldwide arrested or disappeared for producing
"fake news" has tripled, [according to the Committee to Protect
Journalists.](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2018/egypt-is-jailing-more-journalists-on-false-news-charges-than-anywhere-else-in-the-world/)

The United States has long been more enthusiastic about challenging
other countries on their human rights records than inviting scrutiny of
its own, but while under Barack Obama there was a renewed effort to
engage with the UN Human Rights Council, Trump has turned back the
clock. And the world is becoming a more dangerous place for it.

Now, that is all in doubt. The ongoing ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya
in Rakhine State has shown beyond a doubt that the Burmese military can
do as it pleases when it pleases. Suu Kyi is in a difficult position
given the power granted to the Burmese military in the constitution, but
she has taken few if any steps that suggest she finds the Tatmadaw's
actions problematic or wants to bring them to an end. Her government,
moreover, has yet to cast aside draconian laws from the country's junta
era. In short, Suu Kyi may not be the liberal reformer many believed her
to be. Put simply, the challenges in Burma are threefold: the
constitutional powers granted the Tatmadaw, Suu Kyi's apparent
disinterest in further liberalization, and a virulent Buddhist-Bamar
nationalism that has cowed Burma's civilian leadership. Overcoming these
challenges to ensure that Burma's democratization begins to progress
once again is a complicated task. To begin, [the United States should
halt all activities with the Tatmadaw]{.underline}, except for human
rights exchanges and, perhaps, civil affairs training. The US military
should not be complicit in the Tatmadaw's ethnic cleansing campaign;
intentional or not, engaging with the Tatmadaw despite its horrid crimes
normalizes a military that should be seen as an international pariah.
Despite Chinese and Russian interference, [Washington should continue to
pursue]{.underline} a UN Security Council resolution condemning the
violence; ideally, such **[a resolution would impose an arms embargo on
Burma until the Tatmadaw ceases to target civilians, not only in Rakhine
but also across the country, and international monitors are permitted
entry to northern Rakhine]{.underline}**. Chinese and Russian
intransigence should be met with a "naming and shaming" campaign.
Despite the disappointment in Suu Kyi's tenure to date, [Washington
should continue to robustly engage with her and the NLD government more
broadly]{.underline}. Several senior American politicians, policymakers,
and activists have long-standing relationships with Suu Kyi, which
provide opportunities [to directly influence her thinking]{.underline}.
Washington should [also have carrots ready to offer if the NLD
government moves]{.underline}, for example, [to repeal or at least
reform the draconian Official Secrets Act, under which officials have
continued to imprison journalists for doing their jobs, as well as the
Peaceful Assembly and Peaceful Procession Act and the Telecommunications
Law]{.underline}. According to the Assistance Association for Political
Prisoners (Burma), 36 individuals are still serving prison sentences for
political crimes, with 57 more awaiting trial from inside prison and 169
awaiting trial from outside prison.154 Playing the long game, US support
for the development of civil society should continue as well. For
example, [the Project 2049 Institute's Burma Transition Initiative
(BTI), funded by the State Department and the National Endowment for
Democracy, is worthy of continued support]{.underline}. In cooperation
with local partners, the BTI serves as a "platform to support former
political prisoner rehabilitation and reintegration in Burmese society"
and includes a "program to support Burmese-developed policy analysis,
strategic policymaking and political coalition building among
like-minded democratic actors." Specific activities have included the
"first ever ethnic nationalities youth conference" and "funding for a
local think tank to do federalism training for ethnic women leaders."155
Washington should support extant initiatives like the BTI and new ones
as well. Such programs [can aid the maturing of civil society, develop
future leaders, combat nationalistic impulses, and inculcate in Burmese
society]{.underline}---particularly among elites---[an appreciation for
democratic norms]{.underline}. If Burma is going to enjoy a freer
future, the Burmese themselves will have to embrace democracy and
agitate for a new or amended constitution. The United States can help
ensure that they have the tools to do so.

#### CP Solves---reducing US arms sales pressures Myanmar government to stop Rohingya genocide. 

[**Fuchs 18** (Micheal H. Fuchs,]{.underline} a senior fellow at the
Center for American Progress. From 2013 to 2016, he was a deputy
assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, "It's
Time to Hold Myanmar Accountable,"
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/08/31/its-time-to-hold-myanmar-accountable/>)

The Holocaust. Rwanda. Bosnia. Darfur.

And now [Myanmar, according to a new United Nations report]{.underline},
which [accuses the country of carrying out a genocide. It is time for
the United States]{.underline} and the world [to act.]{.underline}

In 2017, [Myanmar's military]{.underline} began a ruthless [campaign
against Rohingya Muslims, killing thousands and displacing more than
700,000 to Bangladesh]{.underline}. Last week, a year after the
massacres, [the U.N. fact-finding mission]{.underline} on
Myanmar [[found](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/FFM-Myanmar/A_HRC_39_64.pdf) that
the "crimes in Rakhine State \[in Myanmar's west\], and the manner in
which they were perpetrated, are similar in nature,]{.underline} gravity
and scope [to those that have allowed genocidal intent to be
established]{.underline} in other contexts."

Min Aung Hlaing, the commander in chief of Myanmar's military, made the
army's intentions clear: "The Bengali problem was a long-standing one
which has become an unfinished job despite the efforts of the previous
governments to solve it. The government in office is taking great care
in solving the problem,"
he [said](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/FFM-Myanmar/A_HRC_39_64.pdf) in
a Facebook post during the crackdown. (In Myanmar, Rohingya are commonly
referred to as Bengali, although they have lived in Myanmar for
generations.) The newly released report recommends the "investigation
and prosecution" of senior members of the Myanmar military to "determine
their liability for genocide."

[This genocide took place against the backdrop of Myanmar's recent steps
toward democratic transformation.]{.underline} After decades of
repressive military rule, the armed forces began freeing political
prisoners, including opposition icon Aung San Suu Kyi, and allowing
economic and political reforms---and in 2015, the country held real
elections. Aung San Suu Kyi's political party, the National League for
Democracy, won control of the civilian government. [Life in Myanmar
seemed to be improving. But the democratization process did not reach
everyone.]{.underline} The military retained extraordinary powers. And
[the Rohingya---long persecuted by the majority Buddhist
population---remained outsiders, vulnerable to the cruelty of the
government.]{.underline}

[The United States supported the democratization process as the best way
to promote broad-based progress in Myanmar]{.underline}. After decades
of sanctions and isolation, the Obama administration decided to meet
action with action, dropping sanctions and providing support for reform
each time Myanmar took another positive step, with the intent of
supporting the country as long as it remained on that path.

Today, [it is clear that Myanmar is no longer on that path]{.underline}.
Whatever good may be accruing for some there through the political
reform process must not be bought with the price of genocide. The world
must respond.

There is no guarantee that concerted international action can change
Myanmar's policies---but we must try. The crisis is ongoing, with
hundreds of thousands living in refugee camps and thousands more in
danger in Myanmar. And after standing by in the face of the crisis a
year ago, the world is now also faced with establishing justice and
showing Myanmar---and other countries---that genocide will be punished
unequivocally, and that the country must change.

First, [the United States must go to the U.N. Security Council to seek a
global arms embargo on Myanmar, sanction top military officials, and
demand equal legal protections for the Rohingya, the safe return of
Rohingya refugees to Myanmar, and access to Rakhine by international
nongovernmental organizations and the U.N.]{.underline}

Second, the United States should immediately make clear that the
civilian government of Myanmar, including Aung San Suu Kyi, will be held
to account if it does not take these steps to improve the situation for
the Rohingya soon. While the military is the prime mover of these
atrocities, as the U.N. report put it, "Through their acts and
omissions, the civilian authorities have contributed to the commission
of atrocity crimes."

Third, [Myanmar should be at the top of the agenda when the United
States meets with the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations]{.underline} at their semi-annual summit meetings in November.
As the State Department official charged with steering the U.S.-ASEAN
relationship on a daily basis for three years, I recognize this is a
difficult task---ASEAN members will want to protect Myanmar from what
they perceive as outside criticism, just as I watched the nations rally
around Thailand after the 2014 coup. But these atrocities cannot be
swept under the rug, and Muslim-majority ASEAN countries may be inclined
to apply more pressure---Indonesia has
already [raised](https://www.smh.com.au/world/asia/indonesia-to-confront-rohingya-crisis-at-asean-20180316-p4z4rz.html) the
issue, and Malaysia has now [taken
in](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-malaysia/malaysia-ready-to-provide-temporary-shelter-for-rohingya-fleeing-violence-idUSKCN1BJ0G7) more
than 100,000 Rohingya refugees.

Fourth, [the United States must fundamentally rethink its relationship
with Myanmar]{.underline}. In May, Mark Green, the administrator of the
U.S. Agency for International
Development, [said](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-usa-rohingya/u-s-aid-chief-reaffirms-commitment-to-myanmar-amid-rohingya-crisis-idUSKCN1IJ1LQ) of
the Rohingya crisis, "This is a country that I think has tremendous
potential. There's an impediment to that work---and that is the crisis
that we're talking about---but we believe that in the long-term future
we can address this impediment." While a return to the international
isolation of previous decades is unlikely to achieve results and should
not be on the table, [the United States can no longer act as though the
Rohingya are but one of many issues Myanmar is struggling with as part
of its reform process.]{.underline}

[The international community should shun Myanmar's military brass and
work to ensure the benefits of economic assistance and trade do not go
to the military's coffers]{.underline}, and the United States should
make clear that this will continue until persecution of the Rohingya
ends.

The Trump administration has been behind the curve for a year and is
likely to keep dragging its feet. Support for more pressure is growing
in Congress, but many still fear weakening Aung San Suu Kyi and her
party. Furthermore, many senior Trump administration officials view
everything in Asia through a lens of competition with China, and the
argument that the United States cannot lose influence in Myanmar is
likely to hold sway. If the Trump administration does not move quickly,
Congress may need to force the administration to act by moving
legislation on its own, as it did when it passed sanctions on Russia
over Trump's objections in 2017.

Looking back, I believe that the United States was right to embrace
Myanmar's political transformation as a genuine opportunity that held
promise to improve the lives of millions. The United States consistently
pressed Myanmar to improve its treatment of the Rohingya in meetings and
in public, but it is clear that it should have done more in the years
prior to 2017. [The United States failed miserably in responding to the
horrors as they unfolded]{.underline} over the course of August and
September 2017, [when the latest crackdown began]{.underline}. It is
difficult to know if a different U.S. policy at any point would have
helped prevent the atrocities. [But what matters today is that the
United States must change course.]{.underline}

In my time working in the East Asia bureau at the U.S. State Department,
I traveled many times to Myanmar and worked closely with colleagues in
the civilian government as the country undertook its process of
democratization. Citizens and officials I met wanted more reform, more
openness, and more opportunities to engage with the United States. I
wanted the country to succeed. I still want it to succeed.

But the Myanmar government has failed not only its Rohingya people---it
has failed its entire population. For Myanmar to have a chance to
succeed in the future, leaders must be held responsible, and policies
must fundamentally change. The United States and the world should not
rest until justice is done.

#### UN calls for imposing arms embargo on Myanmar---pressured to solve HR. 

[**Ramzy 17 (**Austin Ramzy,]{.underline} Hong Kong correspondent for
The New York Times, focusing on coverage of the city and also of
regional and breaking news. He joined The Times in 2013 to launch its
China blog, "Myanmar Draws Scorn for Rohingya Crisis, but Few Urge
Sanctions,"
<https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/18/world/asia/myanmar-rohingya-sanctions.html>)

HONG KONG --- Despite international condemnation of Myanmar's campaign
of violence against the Rohingya people, there have been few calls for a
return to the sort of sanctions that were long a part of the country's
relationship with the West.

After a Rohingya militant group attacked police outposts last month,
[Myanmar's military]{.underline}, along with vigilante groups, [launched
a crackdown in the western state of Rakhine, triggering a refugee crisis
that has sent more than 400,000 Rohingya fleeing to neighboring
Bangladesh.]{.underline}

On Monday, Boris Johnson, Britain's foreign secretary, [led a private
discussion](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/17/world/americas/united-nations-general-assembly-issues.html?module=inline) of
the Rohingya crisis among foreign ministers attending the United Nations
General Assembly. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the de facto head of Myanmar's
government, [last week decided not to
attend](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/13/world/asia/myanmar-united-nations-aung-san-suu-kyi-rohingya.html?module=inline) the
General Assembly, where she would probably have drawn a flood of
criticism.

Mr. Johnson said nothing about whether the government of Myanmar could
face sanctions. In a statement from his office, he called on Ms. Aung
San Suu Kyi to take steps to halt the crisis.

Myanmar's national security adviser participated in the session, which
was closed to the press.

"I was encouraged by our discussion and by the participation of the
senior Burmese representatives," Mr. Johnson said in the statement, "but
we now need to see action to stop the violence and open up immediate
humanitarian access."

While [the United Nations Security Council has the power to impose
economic sanctions on Myanmar]{.underline}, that prospect is considered
unlikely for now. The Myanmar government has said it was working with
Russia and China --- veto-wielding members of the Security Council ---
to block any efforts to punish it over the crackdown in Rakhine.

[The Security Council did condemn the violence last week, its first such
unified statement on Myanmar in nine years]{.underline}. But China
blocked an effort by Egypt to add language calling for Rohingya refugees
to be guaranteed the right to return to Myanmar from Bangladesh, Agence
France-Presse [reported](http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/un-security-council-calls-for-immediate-steps-to-end-myanmar-9214136).
The government of Myanmar, a majority-Buddhist country, does not
recognize the Rohingya, most of whom are Muslim, as citizens.

With regional powers vying to gain influence in Myanmar, China's
government sees potential benefit in backing Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi and
her party, the National League for Democracy, while she faces
international criticism, said Yun Sun, a scholar at the Stimson Center
in Washington.

This is basically an opportunity for China and a vulnerability of Aung
San Suu Kyi," she said. "The Chinese government says the Rohingya issue
doesn't affect us and by supporting Aung San Suu Kyi we don't lose
anything."

"Instead we gain the potential friendship" of the government, Ms. Sun
said.

The state-run Myanmar News Agency [quoted China's ambassador to
Myanmar](http://www.globalnewlightofmyanmar.com/rakhine-issue-internal-affair-chinese-ambassador/) last
week as saying his country supported the crackdown in Rakhine.

"The stance of China regarding the terrorist attacks in Rakhine is
clear, it is just an internal affair," said the ambassador, Hong Liang.
"The counterattacks of Myanmar security forces against extremist
terrorists and the government's undertakings to provide assistance to
the people are strongly welcomed."

In another sign that China is drawing closer to Myanmar, last week it
opened an interim liaison office in Naypyidaw, the remote city that was
inaugurated as Myanmar's capital in 2005. Most foreign missions have
stayed in Yangon, the country's former capital.

China's support for the military crackdown may be partly rooted in the
recent opening of a Chinese-operated oil terminal at Kyaukpyu port, in
southern Rakhine. While the military's campaign is being carried out in
the north of Rakhine, China would be concerned if the violence expanded
and imperiled the terminal, Ms. Sun said.

[On Monday, Human Rights Watch called for targeted sanctions against
Myanmar's military. It also called for new restrictions on the sale of
arms to the country.]{.underline}

"[Burmese security forces are committing ethnic cleansing against the
Rohingya and disregarding the condemnation of world leaders," John
Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, said in a
statement. "The time has come to impose tougher measures that Burma's
generals cannot ignore."]{.underline}

For decades, Myanmar --- or Burma, as it was formerly known --- was one
of the most isolated countries, with the United States and other Western
countries enforcing sanctions against its military-led government. But
as the military has gradually released some of its political control,
the country's interactions have grown dramatically.

[The European Union and the United States [pulled back broad
sanctions](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/world/asia/myanmar-sanctions.html?module=inline) after
elections in 2012]{.underline}. Then last year, President Barack
[Obama [dropped sanctions on aid from
Washington](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/us/politics/obama-lifts-sanctions-myanmar.html?module=inline) to
the government of Myanmar, as well as restrictions on several dozen
people with ties to the former military government.]{.underline}

That move was made in recognition of the advancement of democracy in
Myanmar. But [human rights groups worried it would also reduce the
leverage the United States had to try to curb abuses against the
Rohingya.]{.underline}

Last week, Senator John McCain of Arizona said he would remove language
from a defense-spending bill that would fund cooperation between the
militaries of the United States and Myanmar. Mr. McCain has called on
Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi to do more to help the Rohingya.

Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for
her long struggle against military rule, has many fans among lawmakers
around the world, and that may insulate Myanmar from more serious
censure from the United States and other governments.

The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, [said last
week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhvRPUi2JAc) that "publicly
condemning Aung San Suu Kyi, the best hope for democratic reform in
Burma, is simply not constructive." He noted that under Myanmar's
Constitution, she is barred from the presidency and her civilian
government has no authority over the military. Her position is "an
exceedingly difficult one," he said.

Sean Turnell, an economic adviser to Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's office, said
her civilian government needs international support, "not uninformed
ostracism or irresponsible or calculated incitement."

"The people who lead this government are the same people who faced down
evil for decades," he added. "They remain Myanmar's best hope."

537,000](https://reliefweb.int/report/bangladesh/bangladesh-humanitarian-situation-report-no6-rohingya-influx-6-12-october-2017)
Rohingya have fled violence in Burma (Myanmar) since Aug. 25 and require
humanitarian assistance in Bangladesh.

The rapid pace of their exodus from Rakhine State in Burma [exceeds the
pace](https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/09/daily-chart-13) of
those who fled Rwandan genocide. [The plight of the Rohingya demands
international action---action that likely will be spurred only if the
United States takes concrete steps to hold the Burmese military to
account and ensure humanitarian support and safety to
Rohingya.]{.underline}

The Burmese military is the primary perpetrator of violence against
Rohingya. Satellite imagery analysis indicates that the Burmese military
already burned down roughly [288
villages](https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/09/daily-chart-13).
Villages in Maungdaw township on the border with Bangladesh are almost
completely empty because Rohingya fled the brutal violence. The United
Nations is calling it a textbook case of [ethnic
cleansing](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/11/world/asia/myanmar-rohingya-ethnic-cleansing.html?mcubz=0&_r=0),
and Human Rights Watch believes it may constitute [crimes against
humanity](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/25/burma-military-commits-crimes-against-humanity).

[Countless reports from human rights organizations indicate that severe
atrocities are being committed, including the [murder of innumerable
Rohingya men and
boys](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/world/asia/rohingya-myanmar-atrocities.html?_r=0) and
sexual violence against women, including gang rape. Mothers report
having
their [infants](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/22/witness-carnage-burmas-rakhine-state) ripped
from their arms and thrown in the fire to their death; others recount
harrowing stories of family members being raped and murdered in front of
their own eyes]{.underline}. These are truly the things of nightmares.

The Rohingya have long been persecuted in Burma. They were officially
denied citizenship after the passage of a citizenship law in 1982.
Despite the fact that most Rohingya have lived in Burma for generations,
the Burmese government calls them Bengali, a derogatory reference to
their historically Bangladeshi lineage. After the passage of the
citizenship law, Rohingya were excluded from voting and denied access to
health care and schooling.

While the conflict is rooted in ethnicity, it also has a religious
nature. Nearly [90
percent](http://www.uscirf.gov/sites/default/files/2017.USCIRFAnnualReport.pdf) of
the Burmese population is Buddhist. The majority Buddhist Burman
population discriminates against Rohingya on the basis of their Muslim
religious beliefs. Common rhetoric against Rohingya includes a fear that
Muslims will over-populate Burma. Partially in response to these
fears, [race and religion
laws](http://www.heritage.org/asia/report/us-should-not-stand-while-government-burma-undermines-religious-liberty) passed
in 2015 limit Rohingya and other religious minorities to two children.

[Numerous human rights groups are conducting face-to-face interviews
with Rohingya refugees, many of whom place the blame for the majority of
human rights abuses on the Burmese military. The international
community]{.underline} [would do well to]{.underline} heed their
testimony and [devise strategies]{.underline} to stay the hand of the
military---including evaluating ways [to cut off their access to
resources.]{.underline}

Silence from Suu Kyi, Burma's de facto leader, in the early days of the
Rohingya crisis elicited much criticism from the international
community. Since then, she has agreed to assemble a [humanitarian
project](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-adviser/myanmars-suu-kyi-sets-out-aid-plan-to-end-rohingya-crisis-idUSKBN1CI18X) to
galvanize international funding and support for Rohingya in the hopes of
defusing tension.

[It is [time for a
shift](https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliviaenos/2017/09/29/time-for-a-shift-in-u-s-policy-toward-burma/#494c0b32550b) in
U.S. strategy toward Burma. The relaxation of sanctions]{.underline} in
the wake of the 2015 elections---the same elections that brought Suu Kyi
and the National League for Democracy to power---[[sacrificed
leverage](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/democracy-post/wp/2017/07/18/its-time-for-the-u-s-to-pressure-burma-on-human-rights-once-again/?utm_term=.b4cbce0e1930) the
U.S. had over the military at a time when political reforms became a
real possibility]{.underline}. The Obama administration's warming of
relations with Burma went too far, too fast, and missed the boat on the
complexities of political power-sharing dynamics in Burma. Rather than
serving as an impediment to Burmese political reform, many of the U.S.'s
sanctions against Burma ensured the military's acquiescence with Suu
Kyi's promised political reforms.

[Statements are not enough]{.underline}. In the face of ethnic
cleansing, and even possibly crimes against humanity, [Congress and the
executive branch should consider ways to specifically target the Burmese
military while ensuring that the civilian government has the tools it
needs to guide Burma toward political reform.]{.underline}

That means strategically instituting targeted financial measures. It
also means providing more humanitarian assistance---the U.S. already
increased humanitarian assistance to [\$95
million](https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2017/09/274283.htm) for
fiscal year 2017---to Rohingya in need. The U.S. should also continue
support for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh

administration should ensure that it has a solid plan of action that
ensures accountability for the Burmese military and protection for
Rohingya.

#### Arms Sales key to leveraging Myanmar human rights---CP solves 

[**Feingold 16** (Cathy Feingold, International Director of AFL-CIO,
"Lifting Sanctions on Myanmar reduces leverage on human, worker
rights,"]{.underline}
<https://www.upi.com/Top_News/Opinion/2016/09/16/Lifting-sanctions-on-Myanmar-reduces-leverage-on-human-worker-rights/4501474050255/>

The [[Obama](https://www.upi.com/topic/Barack_Obama/?tps=1) administration\'s
decision to lift nearly all sanctions on Myanmar before
addressing]{.underline} ongoing worker and [human rights]{.underline}
abuses and the military\'s continued role in the country greatly limits
the tools that Myanmar\'s democratic leaders, unions and civil society
organizations possess to ensure an irreversible move toward democracy.

Although recent years have shown definite advances toward democracy and
rule of law, [the transition remains precarious due to continued
military actions against ethnic and religious minorities and the
military\'s control over government ministries and key sectors like
mining, minerals, gas and oil. ]{.underline}

The [sanctions have been an important leverage-creating tool to support
ongoing democratic reforms]{.underline}.  Many of [the
sanctions]{.underline} that restricted Burmese imports, financial
institutions and U.S. investments were lifted between 2012 and 2016, but
the few that remained [were important to pressuring the military to
support the reforms]{.underline}.  In 2013, the United States
established the \"Reporting Requirement on Responsible investment in
Burma\", as the country was formerly known, to collect information and
assess whether or not investments made by U.S. corporations undermined
the country\'s democratic transition. [The use of the U.S. Department of
Treasury\'s \"Specially Designated Nationals\" list prevented corrupt
individuals and entities from benefiting from international investment.
Without these tools, corrupt businesses seeking to exploit Myanmar
workers and the country\'s natural resources will be permitted to act
with impunity.]{.underline}

For years, the AFL-CIO and the global labor movement have worked closely
with Myanmar partners to support democratic union and civil society
organizations and document and address the ongoing use of forced labor
in the country that supports and helps maintains military rule.  Forced
labor has been used in development projects, agriculture and military
businesses. It has been used to impose collective punishment on entire
communities, as the military threatened unions and civil society
organizations in retaliation for criticizing human rights violations.
Forced labor also enabled highly profitable and exploitative development
and business arrangements that enriched the military junta. Today these
practices continue, most notably in the west of Myanmar in Rakhine
state, where the military forces the Rohingya minority to build and
maintain military businesses and infrastructure. Removing remaining
sanctions decreases the leverage the new democratic leadership has to
ensure these acts of modern-day slavery cease.

Myanmar stands at a critical juncture. [As the country takes important
steps toward democracy and the rule of law, the international community
must continue to provide tools that ensure that human and worker rights
and the respect for the country\'s natural resources create the
foundation for a truly inclusive, democratic Myanmar.]{.underline}

#### Unilaterally lifting arms sales on Myanmar fails---incentives based on human rights, democratic reform, and rule of law key. 

[**Long 12 (**Sean K. Long, Writer at the Cornell International Affairs
Review, "A Pacifist in the Pacific: Past, Present, and Future United
States Policy towards Myanmar,"]{.underline}
<http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/1213/a-pacifist-in-the-pacific-past-present-and-future-united-states-policy-towards-myanmar>

Former Secretary of State George Kennan stressed in American Diplomacy
that the US needed to ensure that emerging powers are prevented from
taking control over key global industrial centers. Stephen Walt argued
this logic "reflects a realist view that it is to U.S. advantage to keep
Eurasia divided among many separate powers." As the dominant regional
power in the Western hemisphere, the US must work with Southeast Asian
countries to prevent China from establishing a "sphere of influence" and
similar regional hegemony in Asia. ^56^ As Myanmar emerges from fifty
years of military rule, the current US strategy of pressure plus
engagement is appropriate.^57^

In Perception and Misperception in International Politics, Robert Jervis
states, "[while sticks as well as carrots are to be employed, the
other's friendship cannot be won by gratuitous
concessions]{.underline}."^58^ [The US should offer sticks to deter
Myanmar from taking hostile actions and offer incentivebased carrots to
reward Myanmar's progress in key areas including human rights,
democratic reform, and support for the rule of law.]{.underline} If
Myanmar's government meets clearly stated goals, the US can slowly lift
economic sanctions to cultivate political and economic reform, improved
human rights, and more personal freedoms.

[Over time the US and the international community must enact several
more progressive and engaging policies, but must do so without a
specific timetable to avoid premature transition]{.underline}. [The US
needs to pressure Myanmar to become more transparent with its nuclear
development intentions, allow free assembly, and implement "free, fair,
transparent, and inclusive" elections by 2015]{.underline}.^59^ The US,
alongside ASEAN, the EU, Japan, and Australia, should institute a
development aid package for Myanmar, enacted inside rather than outside
the state, as aid has been implemented in the past.^60^ The aid could
help support and restore the educational system, provide health support
including HIV/AIDS treatment, fund rural farmers, and support other key
efforts to address the needs of a country whose people frequently live
on \$1 to \$3 dollars a day.^61^

There must be adequate oversight in place to ensure any new foreign aid
is going to the right places and reaches the country's civil society to
promote development, rather than being channeled through the government.
[If Myanmar continues positive reforms, the US can improve diplomatic
relations by endorsing Myanmar's integration into international
bodies]{.underline}. Additionally, the international community needs to
reach out to military members in the parliament by offering them freedom
from persecution if they permanently remove themselves from
government.^62^

[The US]{.underline}, through a clear policy of engagement and
accountability, [and Myanmar]{.underline}, through transparency and
reform, [can and must develop mutual credibility]{.underline}, with the
ultimate goal of paving a path where the US, working with the European
Union, Australia, and Japan, can permanently lift sanctions.^63^ [This
can only occur once it is certain that Myanmar's leaders are embracing
reform with institutional safeguards in place so future crises do not
return the state to past trends.]{.underline}

Arguably, [the future of democracy and economic growth rests with Asia
more than any other region in the world]{.underline}.^64^ Myanmar's
potential economic prosperity faded as its neighbors, the Asian
"Tigers," enjoyed economic growth while Myanmar grew at a level almost
two percent lower annually than it did before 1962.^65^ It had been one
of the most undemocratic countries in the world until the end of its
48-year military rule in 2010, when President Thein Sein showed interest
in engaging diplomatically with the US.^66^ In April 2012, the
"landslide victory" for Aung San Suu Kyi's party in parliamentary
by-elections provided hope for Suu Kyi's goal of a "genuinely democratic
atmosphere" in Myanmar.^67^

The Obama Administration is trying to shift American interests away from
the Middle East and towards the Pacific. Secretary Clinton made progress
in her November 2011 visit to the country after President Obama
announced a "larger and long-term role in shaping this region and its
future."^68^ Clinton met with the leader of Myanmar's democratic
movement, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and made progress to create a mutually
beneficial partnership with Myanmar and its allies in the Pacific. The
US government's approach of "pragmatic engagement" can offer the slow
transition to political reform that is needed in Myanmar.

### 2NC Solvency -- Vietnam

#### US should sell arms to Vietnam---conditioned on human rights. 

[**Reuters 16** (Reuters, international news organization, "U.S. Vietnam
Relations Take Next Step As Arms Embargo Lifted,"]{.underline}
<https://www.newsweek.com/vietnam-arms-embargo-lifted-462782>

HANOI (Reuters) - [The United States announced a complete end to its
arms embargo]{.underline} on Vietnam on Monday, a historic step that
draws a line under the two countries\' old enmity and underscores their
shared concerns about China\'s growing military clout.

The move came during President Barack Obama\'s first visit to Hanoi,
which his hosts described as the arrival of a warm spring and a new
chapter in relations between two countries that were at war four decades
ago.

[Obama]{.underline}, the third U.S. president to visit Vietnam since
diplomatic relations were restored in 1995, [has made a strategic
\"rebalance\" toward Asia a centerpiece of his foreign
policy]{.underline}.

Vietnam, a neighbor of China, is a key part of that strategy amid
worries about Beijing\'s assertiveness and sovereignty claims to 80
percent of the South China Sea.

[The decision to lift the arms trade ban suggested]{.underline} such
concerns outweighed [arguments that Vietnam had not done enough to
improve its human rights record and **Washington would lose leverage for
reforms**.]{.underline}

Obama told a joint news conference with Vietnamese President Tran Dai
Quang that disputes in the South China Sea should be resolved peacefully
and not by whoever \"throws their weight around.\" But he insisted the
arms embargo shift was not linked to China.

\"The decision to lift the ban was not based on China or any other
considerations. It was based on our desire to complete what has been a
lengthy process of moving towards normalization with Vietnam,\" he said.
Obama later added his visit to a former foe showed \"hearts can change
and peace is possible.\"

In 2014, the Obama administration eased the decades-old arms embargo to
allow its former Cold War enemy to buy maritime surveillance and
\"security-related\" systems to strengthen it with China in mind.

Now, Hanoi will be able to buy a full range of U.S. weapons and military
equipment. Immediate big-ticket purchases are not expected but
Vietnam\'s military strategists are likely to seek U.S. drones, radar,
coastal patrol boats and possibly P-3 Orion surveillance aircraft.

The sale of arms, Obama said, would depend on Vietnam\'s human rights
commitments, and be made on a case-by-case basis.

Members of the U.S. Congress, which can block foreign arms sales, said
they supported lifting the embargo, but would keep a close eye on
Vietnam\'s human rights record.

\"Congress will work with the administration to ensure today\'s more
expansive shift in policy aligns with U.S. interests, including the
desire for progress on human rights,\" said Republican Senator Bob
Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

HUMAN RIGHTS CONCERNS

[Human Rights Watch]{.underline} advocacy group [reacted with dismay to
Washington\'s decision to toss away a critical lever it might have had
to spur political reform in the Communist party-ruled
state]{.underline}.

Phil Robertson, the watchdog\'s Asia director, said in a statement that
even [as Obama was lifting the embargo, Vietnamese authorities were
arresting a journalist, human rights activists and
bloggers]{.underline}.

\"In one fell swoop, [President Obama has jettisoned what remained of
U.S. leverage to improve human rights in Vietnam -- and basically gotten
nothing for it]{.underline},\" he said.

Obama told the news conference with President Quang that Washington
would continue to speak out for human rights, including citizens\' right
to organize through civil society.

Obama is scheduled to meet with activists on Tuesday.

Quang, who announced the lifting of the U.S. embargo before Obama could
do so, was until recently minister of public security, which activists
say harasses and arrests dissidents.

Dissent was once the domain of just a few in Vietnam, but while the
party has allowed more open criticism in recent years, it is quick to
slap down challenges to its monopoly on power.

Although the communist parties that run China and Vietnam officially
have brotherly ties, China\'s brinkmanship over the South China Sea -
where it has been turning remote outcrops into islands with runways and
harbors - has forced Vietnam to recalibrate its defense strategy.

Carl Thayer, an expert on Vietnam\'s military at Australia\'s Defence
Force Academy, said [the steep costs of U.S. arms would remain a factor
for Hanoi, pushing it toward its traditional suppliers of missiles and
planes, particularly long-time security patron, Russia. On the other
hand, lifting the embargo will provide Vietnam with leverage in future
arms deals with those suppliers.]{.underline}

China sees U.S. support for rival South China Sea claimants Vietnam and
the Philippines as interference and an attempt to establish hegemony in
the region. Washington insists its priority is ensuring freedom of
navigation and flight.

However, China\'s response to the embargo announcement was muted. The
foreign ministry said it hoped the development in relations between the
United States and Vietnam would be conducive to regional peace and
stability.

#### Lifting ban unilaterally gives away a bargaining chip---also puts pressure on China and Russia 

[**Reuters and Vice News 16** (International News Organizations, "US
Lifts Arms Embargo on Vietnam Despite Dire "Human Rights"
Records,"]{.underline}
<https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/7xaqvd/us-lifts-arms-embargo-on-vietnam-despite-dire-human-rights-record>

US President Barack Obama announced on Monday that [Washington
would]{.underline} fully [lift an embargo on sales of lethal arms to
Vietnam, despite human rights organizations describing it as \"among the
world\'s most repressive regimes.\"]{.underline}

At a lavish state luncheon in Hanoi, Vietnamese President Tran Dai Quang
toasted Obama\'s first visit to the country as the arrival of a warm
spring after a cold winter.

[Obama]{.underline}, the third US president to visit Vietnam since ties
were restored in 1995, [has made a strategic \"rebalance\" towards
Asia-Pacific a centerpiece of his foreign policy. Vietnam, where the
United States was at war until 1975, has become a critical part of that
strategy amid concerns about China\'s growing military might and
Beijing\'s sovereignty claims in the South China Sea.]{.underline}

[The decision to lift the arms trade ban]{.underline}, which followed
intense debate within the Obama administration, [suggested that US
concerns about China\'s assertiveness outweighed arguments that
**Vietnam had not done enough to improve its human rights record and
that Washington would lose leverage for reforms.**]{.underline}

The last annual report by NGO Human Rights Watch (HRW) said Vietnam\'s
record remained \"dire in all areas,\" with the Communist Party allowing
no challenge to its leadership, restricting basic rights such as freedom
of speech and association, as well as imprisoning and assaulting
activists and bloggers. Police regularly engage in torture, the justice
system and all public institutions are controlled by the government, and
the media and internet are censored.

\"In short, Vietnam is a police state,\" HRW said in
a [**letter**](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/05/19/letter-president-obama-re-vietnam) to
Obama on May 19, urging him to raise human rights, meet dissidents and
former political prisoners, and give speeches making clear that improved
relations depended on improved human rights.

Responding to the lifting of the embargo, HRW Asia Division Deputy
Director Phil Robertson was staunch in his criticism.

\"As Obama was lifting the US arms embargo, the Vietnam authorities were
busy arresting journalist Doan Trang and other human rights activists
and bloggers on the street and in their houses. In one fell swoop, Obama
has jettisoned what remained of US leverage to improve human rights in
Vietnam --- and basically gotten nothing for it,\" he wrote in a
statement on Monday.

A joint statement from the two governments issued by the State
Department on Monday said the United States \"welcomed Vietnam\'s
ongoing efforts in improving its legal system and undertaking legal
reform in order to better guarantee the human rights and fundamental
freedoms for everyone.\"

That followed a joint news conference with Quang on Monday, at which
Obama acknowledged the countries still had differences over human rights
but said Vietnam had made some modest improvements.

Disputes in the South China Sea should be resolved peacefully and not by
whoever \"throws their weight around,\" he added, but insisted that the
arms embargo move was not linked to China.

\"The decision to lift the ban was not based on China or any other
considerations, it\'s based on our desire to complete what has been a
lengthy process of moving towards normalization with Vietnam,\" he said,
adding later that his visit to a former foe showed \"hearts can change
and peace is possible.\"

He said the sale of arms would depend on Vietnam\'s human rights
commitments, and would be made on a case-by-case basis.

Though the communist parties that run China and Vietnam officially have
brotherly ties, Beijing\'s brinkmanship has forced Vietnam to
recalibrate its defense strategy.

[The lifting of the US embargo will tighten the strategic pressure on
China while deepening Vietnam\'s relationship with the United States. It
will also provide Vietnam with leverage in future arms deals with
traditional weapons suppliers, particularly its long-time security
patron, Russia.]{.underline}

While Vietnam has recently obtained submarines equipped with land-attack
missiles, advanced air defense radars, and state-of-the-art jet fighters
from other nations, it was likely to seek advanced surveillance and
intelligence systems from the US, said Collin Koh, a military expert at
Singapore\'s S Rajaratnam School of International Studies.

\"This is a really cutting-edge but niche field that will help Vietnam
better integrate its various forces --- and the US can really help fill
this gap,\" Koh said.

[Lifting the ban will likely upset China, which sees US support for
rival South China Sea claimants like Vietnam and the Philippines as
interference and an attempt to establish hegemony in the
region.]{.underline} Washington insists its priority is ensuring freedom
of navigation and flight.

China\'s foreign ministry said after the announcement in Hanoi that it
hoped the development in relations between the United States and Vietnam
would be conducive to regional peace and stability.

Underlining the burgeoning commercial relationship between the US and
Vietnam, one of the first deals signed on Obama\'s trip was an \$11.3
billion order for 100 Boeing planes by low-cost airline VietJet.

China is Vietnam\'s biggest trade partner and source of imports. But
trade with the US has swelled 10-fold over the past two decades to about
\$45 billion, and Vietnam is now Southeast Asia\'s biggest exporter to
America.

In the commercial hub, Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, Obama will on
Tuesday meet entrepreneurs and tout a Trans-Pacific Partnership trade
deal he has championed, in which Vietnam would be the biggest
beneficiary of the 12 members.

#### U.S. should pressure Vietnamese human rights. 

[**Sifton 17** (John Sifton,]{.underline} an advocacy director at Human
Rights Watch, "Don't Roll out the Red Carpet for Vietnam's Autocratic
Leader,"
<https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dont-roll-out-the-red-carpet-for-vietnams-autocratic_b_592e0e46e4b047e77e4c3f71>)

[Hanoi is interested in arms deals]{.underline}, and possibly a new
bilateral trade agreement, with the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) on
ice. Most of Vietnam's export market is tied to its neighbor China, and
the government has been looking to hedge its position by improving ties
with the US. (They are also negotiating a trade agreement with the EU
and others.)

[But if]{.underline} Prime Minister [Phuc thinks he will have a free
ride in Washington, he may be in for a rude surprise.]{.underline}
President Trump constitutionally leads on foreign policy, but [Congress
as always advises and consents, and can throw up roadblocks to closer
US-Vietnam ties]{.underline} if members don't like what they see.
Congress must endorse trade agreements, and it can block arms deals.

[There is broad
[bipartisan](https://www.mccaininstitute.org/human-rights-democracy-rule-law-vietnam-making-case/)
concern in Congress about Vietnam's troubling human rights record: it is
an issue that unites members from both parties, and has brought together
liberals and conservatives]{.underline}---from Senators Patrick Leahy to
John Cornyn---to work together on legislation and resolutions. The
Vietnamese-American community is active politically in the United States
and has repeatedly and effectively pressed members to focus on Vietnam's
human rights record.

This is the reality the Trump administration officials have to face:
[they may not want to promote human rights, but political realities
demand that they must.]{.underline} US officials can present the
realities like a middleman would in a negotiation: "Look, [Congress
needs to be won over if the US-Vietnam relationship is going to make any
significant progress. Leaders in Congress have made it clear that your
government needs to release prisoners, stop attacks on dissidents, and
undertake legal reforms, or they will place limits on any agreements we
might reach."]{.underline}

There are plenty of cases for Vietnam to address. There is the detention
of dissident blogger [Tran Huynh Duy
Thuc](https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/05/10/vietnam-overturn-conviction-peaceful-democracy-activists),
who is serving a 16-year prison sentence for his internet writings and
attempts to form a group to promote democracy. The cases of religious
activists [Ngo
Hao](http://www.rfa.org/english/news/vietnam/jailed-09112013161129.html)
and [Nguyen Cong
Chinh](http://www.rfa.org/english/news/vietnam/letter-05302014165358.html),
who are serving 15- and 11-year prison sentences respectively for their
advocacy on religious freedom. There is lawyer Nguyen Van
[Dai](http://www.rfa.org/english/news/vietnam/vietnam-extends-detention-for-human-12282016133049.html),
bloggers [Nguyen Huu
Vinh](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/04/04/vietnam-7-convicted-one-week),
Nguyen Dinh Ngoc, [Nguyen Ngoc Nhu
Quynh](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/10/17/vietnam-reform-criminal-law-respect-rights)
("Mother Mushroom") and [Ho Van
Hai](https://cpj.org/2016/11/blogger-detained-amid-escalating-crackdown-in-viet.php),
and the longtime human rights advocates [Tran Anh
Kim](http://www.rfa.org/english/news/vietnam/vietnam-sends-two-dissidents-to-jail-12162016142421.html)
and [Le Thanh
Tung](http://www.rfa.org/english/news/vietnam/vietnam-sends-two-dissidents-to-jail-12162016142421.html).

When US leaders raise names publicly, it can often lead to those
prisoners being treated better in prison---and released sooner. That is
reason enough to mention them by name.

US officials should also raise concerns with the troubling rise in cases
of harassment and violence against dissidents by so-called government
thugs---widely assumed to be plainclothes government agents. Human
Rights Watch has
[documented](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/01/27/vietnam-new-wave-arrests-critics)
numerous cases in the last year of unidentified men in civilian clothing
beating dissidents, vandalizing their property, and threatening them
with impunity, sometimes in plain view of the official police.

[The Vietnamese government needs to hear that its]{.underline} record is
[a problem]{.underline}. After all, the Politburo, while generally
retrogressive and recalcitrant, remains sensitive to criticism. The
violence of plainclothes thugs is demonstrative: it suggests that the
government may be trying to evade international criticism, as the use of
thugs provides a measure of deniability, however implausible.

[And outside pressure can lead to concrete result]{.underline}s. Take
the now-defunct TPP. While highly problematic, [the agreement contained
provisions that would have compelled Vietnam to improve its labor
record. Those provisions were there in large part because Congress
pressed for them.]{.underline}

President Trump's apparent apathy about human rights aside,
Congressional concerns about Vietnam's record remain, and if there are
to be trade agreements or arms deals, the government will need to
undertake reforms and ease its persecution of dissidents.

If nothing else, one positive outcome for this visit would be for Prime
Minister Phuc to return to Hanoi and tell the Politburo that human
rights issues are still a major topic in Washington. It is up to
Congress to make sure that message is sent.

has gone farther than the declaration on conduct with respect to dispute
settlement and duty to cooperate]{.underline}. Proposals on dispute
settlement have included options such as conciliation, mediation and the

On duty to cooperate, particularly maritime cooperation, the
declaration's five areas of non-traditional security cooperation have
been expanded to include illegal fishing, marine connectivity, and oil
and gas resource cooperation. However, China has floated the idea that
cooperation related to the marine economy should not include
extra-regional countries. [As for confidence-building measures, in

[because these are the areas where maritime incidents have reached
crisis levels.]{.underline} Tensions in these areas have compelled
claimant states, such as the Philippines and Vietnam, to take their case
to Asean. Second, duty to cooperate may include the establishment of
joint marine protected areas, a regional fisheries organisation and an
integrated maritime tourism programme in the Spratlys. China's
artificial islands, given their advanced maritime infrastructure, could
be designated as a hub for promoting non-traditional security
cooperation such as marine scientific research, disaster prevention and
mitigation, and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. **[By

energy exploration, the avoidance of hostile language in radio warnings
to approaching foreign aircraft, not condoning illegal fishing practices

[Additionally, the notion of "militarisation" needs to be clearly
defined because some equipment and facilities such as

relation to the US and other major powers could articulate its own
framework. Fourth, for the code to be legally binding, there should be a
provision prescribing the sanctions or penalties in the event of
defection or non-compliance by any of the claimant states. **[For Asean,
the code of conduct is important in illustrating institutional capacity
and centrality]{.underline}**. For China, it is an opportunity to
mitigate the cost to its reputation of the creation and militarisation
of artificial islands. [But should the code fail to be effective, both
Asean and China's credibility in managing regional security issues would

Since 2010, [China and the 10 members of the Association of South East
Asian Nations (ASEAN) have been discussing a set of rules aimed at
avoiding conflict among rival claimants in the busy South China
Sea]{.underline}. Speaking at his annual news conference on the
sidelines of China\'s parliamentary session, Wang said talks last month
had made \"clear progress\" and had formulated a first draft of a
framework for the code. \"China and ASEAN countries feel satisfied with
this,\" he said. [Wang said tensions in the South China Sea had not just
\"somewhat dropped, but had distinctly dropped\" over the past
year]{.underline}. [But in a nod to the United States and its regular
freedom of navigation naval patrols in the region, Wang said those who
still wanted to \"stir up trouble\" will be condemned by countries in
the region. \"We definitely will not allow this stable situation, which
has been hard to come by, be damaged or interfered with,\" he said. The
United States has criticized China\'s construction of man-made islands
and its build-up of military facilities in the sea, and expressed
concern they could be used to restrict free movement]{.underline}.
[China has long called for]{.underline} what it terms \"countries
outside the region\" - generally a reference to [the United
States]{.underline} - [to stay out of the dispute]{.underline}, saying
China and Southeast Asia are determined to resolve things peacefully.

Isn\'t Interested in a South China Sea Code of Conduct,\" Diplomat,
https://thediplomat.com/2014/02/why-china-isnt-interested-in-a-south-china-sea-code-of-conduct/

Finally, in the declaration [ASEAN and China agreed that adopting an
official "code of conduct" would "further promote peace and stability."
Yet since 2002, there's been little progress made]{.underline} towards
actually taking that next step. In fact, [disagreements
over]{.underline} how to handle proposals for [a code of conduct helped
derail the 2012 ASEAN ministerial meeting]{.underline} held in Cambodia.
The U.S. had reportedly pushed hard for progress on a code of conduct,
with backing from Vietnam and the Philippines. Other ASEAN states,
notably host nation Cambodia, refused to back the proposal. The meeting
dissolved without even the customary diplomatic communiqué. [Many look
to Indonesia, seen as ASEAN's honorary leader, to bridge the gap between
the various member states.]{.underline} Indonesia has in fact been
taking its role as mediator quite seriously. In the aftermath of the
failed 2012 ASEAN ministerial meeting, Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty
Natalegawa visited the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, and
Singapore. His shuttle diplomacy resulted in the "Six-Point Principles"
being issued on July 20, snatching a diplomatic victory from the ashes
of the ASEAN meeting. [Indonesia is also responsible for a reported
draft version of a possible "code of conduct."]{.underline} [According
to Reuters, which has seen the draft, the preliminary text from
Indonesia would call for an end to military exercises in disputed waters
and reaffirm total freedom of navigation in the region. The draft also
reportedly set out rules to prevent accidents at sea]{.underline}.
[China has resisted coming into to negotiations]{.underline} with a
sample draft, [and]{.underline} from Indonesia's proposal [it's not hard
to see why. China's navy routinely conducts exercises in disputed
regions, and the Chinese Coast Guard also patrols the water as a way of
asserting Chinese control. If a code of conduct would outlaw such
activities, it's hard to imagine why China would sign on to
it.]{.underline} China, meanwhile, has its own requirements for a code
of conduct, as articulated last year by [Foreign Minister Wang
Yi]{.underline}. Wang insisted on "consensus through negotiations,"
saying that the negotiations should "keep the comfort of all parties in
mind." From the Chinese perspective, this means that countries with
friendly relations with Beijing should not be pressured to support a
hardline code of conduct. It's unlikely that Beijing is overly concerned
with Vietnam and the Philippines' "comfort" being infringed on by an
overly lax code of conduct. Wang also [called for an "elimination of
interference," saying that the reason ASEAN and China have made no
progress on a code of conduct is due to outside meddling. Wang is
referring to U.S. efforts to encourage a code of conduct -- China has
repeatedly denounced U.S. involvement in ASEAN meetings as
interference]{.underline} in what then-Minister of Defense Liang
Guanglie has called the "distinctively Asian" regional architecture.
"Only Asians should lead the process to resolve regional issues," argued
China Daily after the U.S. raised the South China Sea as an issue at the
2010 ASEAN summit. In other words, [China wants the U.S. excluded from
regional conversations, and will not move forward on a code of conduct
until the U.S. butts out.]{.underline}

MANILA --- [The Philippines]{.underline} on Wednesday [accused a Chinese
vessel of ramming a Philippine boat in the disputed South China Sea,
causing it to sink and putting the lives of the crew at
risk]{.underline}. Although the 22 fishermen onboard were rescued by a
Vietnamese fishing vessel in the area, [Philippine
officials]{.underline} said the collision on Sunday had left them "to
the mercy of the elements." ["We]{.underline} [condemn in the strongest
terms the cowardly action of the Chinese fishing vessel and its crew for
abandoning the Filipino crew]{.underline}," [Defense Secretary Delfin
Lorenzana said]{.underline} in a statement. "This is not the expected
action from a responsible and friendly people." Mr. Lorenzana called for
a formal investigation and for diplomatic action "to prevent a repeat of
this incident." The Chinese Embassy in Manila, the Philippine capital,
could not be reached for comment on Wednesday, which was a holiday in
the Philippines commemorating its independence from Spain.President
Rodrigo [Duterte of the Philippines has courted China as a strategic
partner since he was elected]{.underline} in 2016. He was most recently
in China last month, his fourth visit in three years, [but bilateral
ties have been fraying, particularly over territorial disputes. The
Philippine vessel, FB Gimber1, was anchored near Recto Bank in the South
China Sea, a strategically important area that is claimed in whole or in
part by China, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam.
Manila calls the area the West Philippine Sea]{.underline}, and [an
international tribunal]{.underline} in The Hague [ruled in 2016 that it
was in the country's exclusive economic zone]{.underline}. [China has
refused to abide by the ruling, and Mr. Duterte has said there is no way
to enforce it in the face of China's military strength]{.underline}. At
a meeting of Asia-Pacific defense officials in Singapore this month, Mr.
Lorenzana called on all South China Sea claimants to exercise utmost
caution to prevent an escalation of hostilities. He pushed for freedom
of navigation in the area, while the United States said it was investing
heavily in new technology that would improve its defense capabilities
along with those of its allies. Patrick Shanahan, the acting United
States secretary of defense, also urged Beijing to follow a "rules-based
order" in the region. [Hundreds of protesters marched in Manila on
Wednesday over China's actions in the South China Sea and called on
Filipinos to defend their country's sovereignty. Pamalakaya, a group of
fishermen who joined the protest, demanded that Chinese vessels
immediately withdraw from the disputed area and that Mr. Duterte toughen
his stance against the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping.]{.underline} Bobby
Roldan, [a spokesman for the group, said members could not fish in peace
"courtesy of China's intimidating presence in our waters." "And yet we
don't hear any condemnation from]{.underline} the [Duterte]{.underline}
administration," he said.

https://thediplomat.com/2019/07/environmental-protest-breaks-out-in-chinas-wuhan-city/

For 70 years the United States has dominated Southeast Asia with both
hard and soft power --- the capability to use economic or cultural
influence to shape the preferences of others. Soft power underpins and
makes possible robust hard power relationships. But some analysts and
policymakers refuse to recognize that U.S. influence and its
relationships in Southeast Asia are much shallower and more ephemeral
than assumed. Indeed, [despite U.S. enticement and pressure, U.S. allies
Australia, Japan, and the Philippines have so far declined U.S. requests
to join its freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea
against China's claims. Indonesia has expressed disapproval over such
U.S. "power projection" in the area. U.S. relations with Thailand have
not been close since the military coup there in 2014 and Bangkok seems
to be leaning toward China. Malaysia-U.S. relations have been brittle
since the United States took a legal interest in Prime Minister Najib
Razak's international financial dealings. Even staunch U.S. strategic
partner Singapore seems to be seeking a more neutral position between
Washington and Beijing. A recent example]{.underline} of this decline of
U.S. soft power [was the reaction of the Philippines regarding the
January 17 USS Hopper freedom of navigation operation (FONOP) near
Scarborough Shoal]{.underline}. The Shoal is claimed by China, Taiwan,
and the Philippines. The U.S. Navy guided missile destroyer sailed
through the 12 nautical mile territorial sea around the disputed
feature. The Hopper's transit was in innocent passage, which is
generally considered legal (if somewhat provocative). China requires
permission for innocent passage by warships and objected. [For the
United States, this FONOP was a demonstration of international law. But
it got no support from its ally, the Philippines.]{.underline} Indeed,
to Washington's chagrin, [Philippine presidential spokesperson Harry
Roque told the Straits Times, "For us, that \[referring to China's
protest against the FONOP\] is really a problem of America because we
have come to a point that we now have an independent foreign policy...
The problem of America today is no longer the problem of the
Philippines]{.underline}."

Unfortunately, [military buildups and conflicting territorial
ambition]{.underline}s are not the only security challenges afflicting
the region. Numerous nontraditional security issues bedevil Southeast
Asian governments and do so with potential global implications. Most
prominently, [the region hosts several insurgencies]{.underline} of
varying intensity [and]{.underline} is home to Islamist militant
organizations, which [have affiliations with global jihadist groups such
as al Qaeda and the Islamic State]{.underline}. Moreover, these groups
are engaged in or have ties to transnational crime, including piracy,
kidnapping for ransom, human trafficking, and the drug trade. [Taken
together]{.underline}, [these challenges]{.underline} threaten both
locals and foreign tourists, [destabilize intraregional relations,
inhibit economic and political development, threaten to increase the
frequency and severity of human rights abuses]{.underline}, threaten
[\[and\] international shipping,]{.underline} and make possible the
emergence of ungoverned spaces from which terrorists might launch
attacks abroad. Consider a few recent examples: • During a battle with
Kokang rebels in northern Burma in March 2015, a Burmese aircraft
strayed across the Chinese border before dropping a bomb, killing five
Chinese nationals. • In June 2015, rebels ambushed Indian soldiers in
Northeastern India's Manipur state before retreating across the Burmese
border. In response, the Indian Army carried out a cross-border raid to
destroy two rebel camps in Burma.24 On top of these violent threats,
[Southeast Asians also face]{.underline} the prospects of [serious
natural disasters]{.underline} combined [with local governments'
insufficient capabilities for effective response]{.underline}. Southeast
Asia is one of the world's most disaster-prone regions. Since the turn
of the century, Southeast Asian countries have been struck by the 2004
Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami (208,000 killed and 142,000
unaccounted for27), a 2006 Java earthquake (5,700 killed28), 2008's 10

(84,500 killed and 53,800 missing29), and 2013's Typhoon Haiyan (6,300

eruptions, storms, and floods, accounting for thousands of casualties,
have been recorded.

#### US key to use arm sales as leverage over SEA countries to deescalate growing security dilemma -- complete cutoff can't solve

American Enterprise Institute (AEI), where he analyzes US defense policy
in the Asia-Pacific region, Chinese military modernization,
cross--Taiwan Strait relations, and Korean Peninsula security. A regular

The South China Sea and terrorism tend to dominate discussions of
security in Southeast Asia, and rightly so. Conflicts among ASEAN
states, however, persist as threats to regional stability, even if they
are only secondary in nature. Historical animosities have remained
problematic, especially as they intersect with territorial disputes.
Meanwhile, [military modernization efforts across the region, while
necessary]{.underline}, may inadvertently contribute to a less stable
security environment. Richard Bitzinger argues that these efforts
[amount to an "arms competition," rather than an arms race]{.underline},
with implications for regional security. In particular, continued
purchases of advanced weapon platforms [may contribute to a classical
"security dilemma"---a situation whereby actions taken by a country can
actually undermine the security and stability that they were meant to
increase]{.underline}. In this case, arms acquisitions by one state,
even if it has no desire to threaten its neighbours, can often lead to
anxieties and insecurities being felt by nearby states. Reciprocal
responses by neighbouring states to "regain" security by buying their
own advanced weapons often only raise regional tensions further. Even
defensively oriented weapons purchases, such as air defences or lightly
armed offshore patrol vessels, may be perceived as threatening, as they
could conceivably be employed in anti-access/area denial operations in
the event of conflict. Finally, [even if such tit-for-tat arms purchases
do not lead to conflict, they can reinforce mutual insecurities and
suspicions, and ultimately have a deleterious impact on regional
security.]{.underline}48 Arms procurements that may be necessary to
update or replace aging equipment in response to Chinese actions may
understandably be considered with wariness by neighbors. Use of such
arms to shape a security environment that China has unsettled could,
unintentionally or not, unsettle others' security perceptions[. For the
United States, the proper response is not to cut off its own arms sales
to the region or encourage others to do so. Rather, the United States
should seek to proactively shape the security environment in ways
conducive to regional peace and stability, such that Southeast Asians
need not conclude they must do so entirely on their own.]{.underline}
Second, the United States should make its good offices available to
regional states in need of mediation should ASEAN fail to maintain
intraregional peace, as has happened in the past. Washington's ability
to contain discord between third parties is limited---consider relations
between Japan and South Korea, two of America's closest allies---but
mitigating the conditions that may lead to conflict is, at least in some
instances, in America's reach.

STATE DEPARTMENT - As [China moves to complete the creation of military
outposts in the South China Sea, Beijing's negotiation with southeastern
Asian nations over a binding code of conduct is gaining momentum**. But
U.S. officials and experts warn China's insertions in the draft South
China Sea code of conduct may put Washington and Beijing on a collision
course.**]{.underline} The text of the draft also shows that deep
divisions remain among claimants. [One of the Chinese provisions in the
text states, **"The Parties shall not hold joint military exercises with
countries from outside the region, unless the parties concerned are
notified beforehand and express no objection."**]{.underline} China also
proposed cooperation on the marine economy "shall not be conducted in
cooperation with companies from countries outside the region." A State
Department spokesperson told VOA the United States is concerned by
reports [China has been pressing members of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations "in the closed-door talks, to accept restrictions on their
ability to conduct exercises with security partners, and to agree not to
conduct oil and gas exploration in their claimed waters with energy
firms based in countries which are not part of the ongoing
negotiations."]{.underline} "These proposals, if accepted, would limit
the ability of ASEAN nations to conduct sovereign, independent foreign
and economic policies and would directly harm the interests of the
broader international community," added the State Department
spokesperson. **[Competing for influence For China, the benefits are
apparent. The United States and China are competing for influence in the
Indo-Pacific region]{.underline}**. China and Southeast Asian navies are
heading to their first joint exercises from October 22 to 28. **[An
inaugural ASEAN-U.S. maritime exercise will be held next
year.]{.underline}** "In other words, China would like a veto over all
the military exercises held by ASEAN countries with other nations. [I
think this really provides some evidence that China indeed is trying to
limit American influence in the region]{.underline}, one might go so far
as to say to push American military presence out of the region
eventually, but certainly in the area of the South China Sea," said
Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington. While the United
States is not a claimant to the sovereignty of disputed islands in the
South China Sea, [Washington has said China\'s efforts to militarize
outposts in the contested waters endanger the free flow of trade and
undermine regional stability, a claim Beijing rebuts. **The United
States is also calling for ongoing discussions on the South China Sea
code of conduct to be transparent and consultative with the rest of the
international community.**]{.underline} U.S. officials said the
international community has direct stakes in the outcome. Code of
conduct draft In August, Singapore\'s Foreign Minister Vivian
Balakrishnan announced China and ASEAN's 10 member countries had reached
a draft agreement. (Single Draft South China Sea Code of Conduct
Negotiating Text or SDNT). ASEAN leaders are to meet next month in
Singapore. Highlighting the importance of such a draft, a Center for
Strategic and International Studies report said for the first time in
many years, an effective diplomatic process to manage South China Sea
disputes seems possible. ASEAN and China have been discussing a
potential code of conduct (COC) to manage the South China Sea maritime
and territorial disputes for more than two decades. [Leaked details of
the [draft ](https://thediplomat.com/2018/08/a-closer-look-at-the-asean-china-single-draft-south-china-sea-code-of-conduct/)state
the code of conduct is "not an instrument to settle territorial disputes
or maritime delimitation issues."]{.underline} Managing disputes, The
draft shows deep divisions among South China Sea claimants over many
issues, according to experts, especially over the most sensitive issues
like the agreement's geographic scope, potential dispute settlement
mechanisms, and details of resource exploration. "[What the code of
conduct is intended to do is to manage the disputes to prevent them from
escalating, and basically to allow the freezing of the thorny
territorial questions, while states can manage the resources and manage
tensions in the near to medium term,]{.underline}" said Gregory Poling,
director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative" at Center for
Strategic and International Studies (CSIS**[). In August a trilateral
statement from Japan, Australia and the [United
States](https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2018/08/284940.htm) called for
the Code of Conduct "to not prejudice the interests of third parties or
the rights of all states under international law; to reinforce existing
regional architecture; and to strengthen parties' commitments to cease
actions that would complicate or escalate
disputes.]{.underline}**" Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense
for South and Southeast Asia Amy Searight said Washington's "concrete
position" on no prejudice against third parties "is to really criticize
China\'s attempt to marginalize U.S. influences" in the region.

[China and its Southeast Asian neighbours have too much at stake
economically to allow tensions over the South China Sea to get in the
way of relations]{.underline}. Understandably, then, **[the annual
Association of Southeast Asian Nations leaders' summit was marked not by
conflict, but cordiality]{.underline}**. Fresh strains caused by Chinese
island-building and an international tribunal's rejection of Beijing's
claims to almost all the waters could not be ignored, though, ensuring
renewed vigour in finding a solution. [An agreement to exercise
restraint while working resolutely towards finalising a legally binding
code of conduct sets the right direction towards assuring regional peace
and stability.]{.underline} Marking the 25th anniversary of China-Asean

making progress towards early adoption of the code of conduct, based on
consensus. [To prevent maritime conflicts, guidelines for a hotline to

unexpected encounters of naval ships and aircraft.]{.underline} China's
refusal to acknowledge July's ruling at The Hague court in a case
brought by the Philippines was not mentioned during talks, highlighting
its sensitivity, but also underscoring the pragmatism of Asean
governments. They know there is a need for a two-track approach, one to
deal with the dispute, the other to push for economic growth and
development. [The sides have been working on a code of conduct since
China initiated the idea 14 years ago. It was mandated by the 2002
China-Asean Declaration on Conduct of the Parties in the South China
Sea, a non-binding document calling for self-restraint and resolution of
disputes through direct negotiations]{.underline}. There have since been
numerous violations by most of the six governments which claim all or
part of the waters. **[Intervention by the US through its military pivot
to the region and building and strengthening of alliances has
complicated matters.]{.underline}** [But as complex as the dispute is,
governments know that it cannot be allowed to get in the way of economic
objectives]{.underline}. China is Asean's biggest trading partner and
Asean is China's third largest. Asia is an integral part of Beijing's
belt and road initiative. There is also every need for perspective;
President Xi Jinping's goals are to revive the Chinese economy, boost
China's global role and have a workable relationship with the US,
matters that the dispute could too easily derail. [Agreeing to a code of
conduct is in the interests of China and Asean. With it will come
assurance, peace and security]{.underline}.

a code of conduct in the South China Sea last August by the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations and China has raised hopes that such a code
will ensure lasting peace and stability in the South China
Sea.]{.underline}** While details of the text have yet to be officially
issued, a leaked draft includes **[five critical issues for negotiations
-- "geographic scope", "dispute settlement", "duty to cooperate", "role
of third parties" and "legal status".]{.underline}** In these, [the code
has gone farther than the declaration on conduct with respect to dispute
settlement and duty to cooperate]{.underline}. Proposals on dispute
settlement have included options such as conciliation, mediation and the
activation of the High Council for the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation.
On duty to cooperate, particularly maritime cooperation, the
declaration's five areas of non-traditional security cooperation have
been expanded to include illegal fishing, marine connectivity, and oil
and gas resource cooperation. However, China has floated the idea that
cooperation related to the marine economy should not include
extra-regional countries. [As for confidence-building measures, in
addition to military exchanges, humane treatment of people in distress
and voluntary notification of impending joint military exercises stated
in the DOC, the code of conduct warrants that an exchange of
information, mutual port calls of military vessels and joint patrols and
military exercises be done on a regular basis**. China also seeks to
ensure that a veto power can be exercised over joint military exercises
that are to be conducted with extra-regional countries.**]{.underline}
On self-restraint, the Philippines has suggested [traditional fishing

the simulation of attacks involving aircraft and vessels from other
claimant countries. These calls for proscribing specific actions are
vital because the absence of technical specificity has led to
unpredictable behaviour and regional instability. This is why,
regardless of rounds of non-traditional security cooperation workshops
and dialogue, security complications recur, and confidence-building
measures, such as  [maritime/naval

states, such as the Philippines and Vietnam, to take their case to
Asean. Second, duty to cooperate may include the establishment of joint
marine protected areas, a regional fisheries organisation and an
integrated maritime tourism programme in the Spratlys. China's
artificial islands, given their advanced maritime infrastructure, could
be designated as a hub for promoting non-traditional security
cooperation such as marine scientific research, disaster prevention and
mitigation, and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. **[By
involving China in fostering regional public good and demonstrating
compliance with international environmental laws, threat perceptions
about the military functions of China's man-made islands can be

clauses should extend to the non-unilateral deployment of oil rigs and
energy exploration, the avoidance of hostile language in radio warnings

[Additionally, the notion of "militarisation" needs to be clearly

### \*Condition on Good Behavior??

#### Southeast Asia and US relations on brink now.

**[Mazza 18]{.underline}**

Unfortunately, [military buildups and conflicting territorial
ambition]{.underline}s are not the only security challenges afflicting
the region. Numerous nontraditional security issues bedevil Southeast
Asian governments and do so with potential global implications. Most
prominently, [the region hosts several insurgencies]{.underline} of
varying intensity [and]{.underline} is home to Islamist militant
organizations, which [have affiliations with global jihadist groups such
as al Qaeda and the Islamic State]{.underline}. Moreover, these groups
are engaged in or have ties to transnational crime, including piracy,
kidnapping for ransom, human trafficking, and the drug trade. [Taken
together]{.underline}, these challenges threaten both locals and foreign
tourists, [destabilize intraregional relations, inhibit economic and
political development, threaten to increase the frequency and severity
of human rights abuses]{.underline}, threaten [\[and\] international
shipping,]{.underline} and make possible the emergence of ungoverned
spaces from which terrorists might launch attacks abroad. Consider a few
recent examples: • During a battle with Kokang rebels in northern Burma
in March 2015, a Burmese aircraft strayed across the Chinese border
before dropping a bomb, killing five Chinese nationals. • In June 2015,
rebels ambushed Indian soldiers in Northeastern India's Manipur state
before retreating across the Burmese border. In response, the Indian
Army carried out a cross-border raid to destroy two rebel camps in
Burma.24 On top of these violent threats, [Southeast Asians also
face]{.underline} the prospects of [serious natural
disasters]{.underline} combined [with local governments' insufficient
capabilities for effective response]{.underline}. Southeast Asia is one
of the world's most disaster-prone regions. Since the turn of the
century, Southeast Asian countries have been struck by the 2004 Indian
Ocean earthquake and tsunami (208,000 killed and 142,000 unaccounted
for27), a 2006 Java earthquake (5,700 killed28), 2008's 10 AN AMERICAN

floods, accounting for thousands of casualties, have been recorded.

The South China Sea and terrorism tend to dominate discussions of
security in Southeast Asia, and rightly so. Conflicts among ASEAN
states, however, persist as threats to regional stability, even if they
are only secondary in nature. Historical animosities have remained
problematic, especially as they intersect with territorial disputes.
Meanwhile, [military modernization efforts across the region, while
necessary]{.underline}, may inadvertently contribute to a less stable
security environment. Richard Bitzinger argues that these efforts
[amount to an "arms competition," rather than an arms race]{.underline},
with implications for regional security. In particular, continued
purchases of advanced weapon platforms [may contribute to a classical
"security dilemma"---a situation whereby actions taken by a country can
actually undermine the security and stability that they were meant to
increase]{.underline}. In this case, arms acquisitions by one state,
even if it has no desire to threaten its neighbours, can often lead to
anxieties and insecurities being felt by nearby states. Reciprocal
responses by neighbouring states to "regain" security by buying their
own advanced weapons often only raise regional tensions further. Even
defensively oriented weapons purchases, such as air defences or lightly
armed offshore patrol vessels, may be perceived as threatening, as they
could conceivably be employed in anti-access/area denial operations in
the event of conflict. Finally, [even if such tit-for-tat arms purchases
do not lead to conflict, they can reinforce mutual insecurities and
suspicions, and ultimately have a deleterious impact on regional
security.]{.underline}48 Arms procurements that may be necessary to
update or replace aging equipment in response to Chinese actions may
understandably be considered with wariness by neighbors. Use of such
arms to shape a security environment that China has unsettled could,
unintentionally or not, unsettle others' security perceptions[. For the
United States, the proper response is not to cut off its own arms sales
to the region or encourage others to do so. Rather, the United States
should seek to proactively shape the security environment in ways
conducive to regional peace and stability, such that Southeast Asians
need not conclude they must do so entirely on their own.]{.underline}
Second, the United States should make its good offices available to
regional states in need of mediation should ASEAN fail to maintain
intraregional peace, as has happened in the past. Washington's ability
to contain discord between third parties is limited---consider relations
between Japan and South Korea, two of America's closest allies---but
mitigating the conditions that may lead to conflict is, at least in some
instances, in America's reach.

### \*Genero condition??

#### Arms sales need to meet three conditions---threat to national security, no external conflicts, and no fill-in. (maybe not for the CP but I think it could work as some other neg card)

[**Thrall et al 18** (Trevor Thrall,]{.underline} a senior fellow for
the Cato's Institute's Defense and Foreign Policy Department, with
expertise in international security and the politics of American
national security and an associate professor at George Mason
University's Schar School of Policy and Government where he teaches
courses in international security; Caroline Dorminey, a policy analyst

on issues pertaining to the US defense budget, defense politics, force

Business, The Role of Arms Sales in U.S. Foreign Policy,"
<https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor039)>

[The United States should reorient its arms sales policy to ensure that
sales provide strategic benefits and to avoid producing negative
unintended consequences]{.underline}. At a practical level, [this means
reducing arms sales dramatically]{.underline}, especially [to nations
with high risk factors]{.underline} for negative outcomes. Officials
should look for other ways to conduct foreign policy in situations where
arms sales have been common tactics --- such as when the United States
negotiates access to military bases or seeks cooperation in the war on
terror. The arms sales process should also be revised in order to ensure
that all sales receive more thorough scrutiny than has been the case to
date.

[To implement this new vision for arms sales]{.underline} we recommend
the following steps:

1.  [**Issue an Updated Presidential Policy Directive on Arms
    Sales** ]{.underline}--- Most importantly, the president should
    issue a new Presidential Policy Directive reorienting U.S. arms
    sales policy so that the new default policy is "no sale." [The only
    circumstances]{.underline} in which the United States should sell or
    transfer arms to another country [are when three conditions are
    met:]{.underline} (1) [there is a direct threat to American national
    security; (2) there is no other way to confront that threat other
    than arming another country; and (3) the United States is the only
    potential supplier of the necessary weapons.]{.underline}\
    \
    The reasoning behind this recommendation is threefold: first, as
    noted, the United States enjoys such a high level of strategic
    immunity that there is currently no direct security rationale for
    arms sales to any nation. Second, even if one believes that the
    United States has an interest in helping other nations defend
    themselves against internal enemies (e.g., Iraq, Afghanistan) or
    external ones (e.g., South Korea, Taiwan, NATO countries), there are
    other ways the United States can help instead of supplying weapons.
    Finally, [by halting the sales of weapons the United States will
    decrease the risk of entanglement in conflicts that do not directly
    involve American security]{.underline}. It will also improve the
    diplomatic flexibility of the United States to play the role of
    honest broker and to exert moral leverage on dueling parties.

2.  [**Immediately Stop Selling Weapons to Risky
    Nations** ]{.underline}--- [The first step in implementing a new
    approach should be to stop selling weapons to the countries most
    likely to misuse weapons or to lose control of them.]{.underline}
    Based on the risk assessment described here, [we recommend that the
    United States immediately halt the sale of weapons to any nation
    that scored in the "highest risk" category for any risk factor, or
    which is actively engaged in conflict.]{.underline} Taking this
    action would immediately add 71 nations to the list of embargoed
    nations until further notice. This simple and commonsense step would
    mitigate some of the worst negative consequences and stop the United
    States from enabling conflicts abroad.

3.  **Improve and Respond to End-Use Monitoring** --- The United States
    should significantly expand its tracking of the use and misuse of
    American weapons. The current system of end-use monitoring does not
    collect enough data on how weapons are used once they are
    transferred. This is largely because the system is designed to
    monitor and prevent instances of dispersion and corruption and is
    not necessarily focused on the use of force by the client military
    and government. Rather than focusing on tracking abuse down to a
    single military unit, end-use monitoring should hold countries
    accountable for the actions of their militaries as a whole. End-use
    monitoring should take into account the bigger picture of a
    country's strategic environment and should assess weapons sales
    based on a proposed customer's history, actions, and participation
    in ongoing conflicts. End-use monitoring should be tracked and
    reported annually, and the results should be made public to enforce
    oversight and give Congress the information needed to make
    better-informed decisions.

4.  **Amend the AECA to Require Congressional Approval for All Arms
    Sales** --- Finally, we recommend that the AECA be amended to
    require congressional approval for all arms sales. The current law
    is designed to make arms sales easy by making it difficult for
    Congress to block them. Blocking a sale requires a majority vote in
    both houses of Congress, with such votes typically cropping up
    inconveniently in the middle of other, more-pressing issues on the
    legislative agenda. Congress has exerted little or no influence over
    arms sales and has allowed the executive branch near-complete
    autonomy. Requiring a congressional vote to approve arms sales, on
    the other hand, would subject arms deals to much more intense
    scrutiny than has traditionally been the case, and blocking
    misguided arms sales would be much easier. Requiring a separate
    piece of legislation to approve each arms deal, not simply requiring
    a resolution against, would encourage deliberations about the
    strategic benefits of any proposed deal.

Selling major conventional weapons is a risky business, especially to
nations where conditions are ripe for bad outcomes. After decades of
selling weapons to almost any nation that asks, enough evidence has
accumulated to make it clear that the costs outweigh the benefits.
Policy change is long overdue.

Unfortunately, Donald Trump has embraced the conventional wisdom. In
addition to the massive \$110 billion deal with Saudi Arabia, Trump has
seized on the tensions with North Korea to encourage Japan and other
Asian allies to buy more American weapons. For Trump, the rationale was
simple: "It's a lot of jobs for us and a lot of safety for
Japan."[^101^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor101)

As we have argued here, this conventional wisdom is misguided. [Instead
of turning first to arms sales, which are likely to inflame tensions in
hot spots like the Pacific Rim or the Middle East, the United States
should rely more heavily on diplomacy. The United States does not need
the limited economic benefits arms sales provide --- and it certainly
does not need the strategic headaches that come with them.]{.underline}

#### US key to deter China and Vietnam escalating tension through arms sales and further support to southeast Asia simultaneously protecting US interests.

China-Vietnam Military Clash

The United States has several options to lower the risk of a
China-Vietnam military crisis, although U.S. influence over China and
even Vietnam is limited. These include strategies to promote
cooperation, options designed to bolster Vietnam's ability to deter
Chinese actions that threaten freedom of navigation and/or U.S.
strategic interests, and options that would allow the United States to
disengage from a China-Vietnam conflict that did not threaten U.S.
strategic interest or involve U.S. allies. Promote cooperation. [A code
of conduct for vessels operating in the South China Sea could be the
most effective cooperative strategy]{.underline}. China and Southeast
Asian nations have participated in talks about a code of conduct since
September 2013. Yet the ten members of ASEAN have been divided on how
forcefully to press for a code of conduct and what to include in such a
code. In other disputes, China has responded proactively when ASEAN
countries have presented a unified stance; since the late 2000s, as many
Southeast Asian nations have complained about the environmental effects
of Chinese state firms' projects in the region, Chinese companies have
responded by devoting funds and time to corporate social welfare
programs. The United States could work with Vietnam and other Southeast
Asian nations to create a united position on a code of conduct. If China
refuses to participate in further discussions on a code of conduct, the
United States should encourage ASEAN to develop its own draft code and
to present it publicly to Beijing. A second cooperative strategy could
be to [promote ASEAN-China joint economic and scientific projects in the
South China Sea, such as programs to codify the marine
biodiversity]{.underline}. These scientific projects build trust and
could lead to joint ASEAN-China oil and gas exploration projects, which
could have the potential to dramatically reduce tensions. A third
cooperative strategy could be to [encourage joint China-Vietnam patrols
of the two countries' land border]{.underline}, although U.S. influence
over issues related to the China-Vietnam land border is extremely
limited. Although the two countries' border police hold regular
consultations and sometimes exchange intelligence, they do not conduct
joint patrols, [which would put senior officers in closer communication
and reduce the risk of exchanges of fire along the border. Use naval
maneuvers, arms sales, declarations of U.S. policy, and joint exercises
to deter China. A preventive strategy could also be one of
deterrence]{.underline}, which could be adopted in the South China Sea
at the same time that the United States encourages cooperative measures.
[The United States could send U.S. naval vessels through areas of the
South China Sea where China has just prevented boats from Vietnam or
another country from traveling, to demonstrate U.S. commitment to
freedom of navigation]{.underline}. The United States has already used a
variant of this strategy by purposefully sending B-52 bombers through
disputed areas claimed by China as its air defense zone without
informing China in advance. [A second step could be to use public and
private diplomacy to clarify U.S. commitments to allies with claims in
the South China Sea. U.S. leaders could state publicly that U.S. forces
will come to the aid of any treaty allies if they face unprovoked
attacks in areas of the South China Sea claimed by multiple
countries]{.underline}. Currently, U.S. officials have only vaguely
stated that freedom of navigation in the South China Sea is a U.S.
national interest. [Clearer public and private U.S. statements about the
South China Sea risk antagonizing China]{.underline} and contributing to
escalation, [but even without clear U.S. declarations]{.underline} on
the South China Sea, [Beijing is rapidly]{.underline} dredging and
[militarizing disputed maritime areas.]{.underline} [China is unlikely
to halt its actions if the United States retains an ambiguous stance on
the South China Sea.]{.underline} In the event of an unprovoked attack
on a U.S. treaty ally in the South China Sea, the United States would
almost surely be obligated to help in defense, whether or not Washington
had made clear public statements in advance. Not assisting in a
partner's defense could dramatically undermine the United States' image
as guarantor of regional security. In addition, [the United States could
minimize the possibility of its public statements antagonizing China by
simultaneously delivering public warnings to its partners in the South
China Sea region--- Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, and
Malaysia---that the United States will not necessarily defend them in a
maritime conflict if they provoked the crisis]{.underline}. Examples of
such provocation would be if one preemptively attacked Chinese vessels
or blocked Chinese vessels from navigating international waters. [A
third step could be to upgrade Vietnam's defense capabilities by
expanding the range of U.S. lethal arms sales to Hanoi, which Congress
approved in autumn 2014, to include aircraft and naval
vessels]{.underline}. The United States also could help improve
Vietnam's defenses by developing annual U.S.-Vietnam combat exercises.
These types of deterrence could put U.S., Vietnamese, and Chinese forces
into close proximity and heighten the risk of miscalculation. Yet
deterrence could be effective in stopping China from projecting power in
ways that could provoke a confrontation with its neighbors. [Decrease
exposure to a China-Vietnam land confrontation in mainland Southeast
Asia.]{.underline} A strategy of minimizing U.S. involvement in any
potential land border conflict or broader rivalry over mainland
Southeast Asia could be the best option for the United States. The
United States has minimal strategic and economic interests in much of
mainland Southeast Asia; the China-Vietnam land border does not matter
significantly to the U.S. economy, and [the United States has allowed
other partners in Asia to resolve land border disputes without any U.S.
involvement]{.underline}. However, a strategy of avoiding any
involvement in a China-Vietnam land conflict could frustrate Vietnam and
could encourage China to act more assertively throughout the region. It
also could be interpreted by other U.S. partners in Asia as a dangerous
precedent if the United States declined to respond to Chinese
provocation. Still, even without outside assistance, Vietnam has
extensive land defenses and is far better prepared to defend its
northern border than it is to defend its interests at sea. [U.S. public
and private diplomacy regarding the South China Sea also could help
minimize Asian partners' fears that U.S. avoidance of a land conflict
would encourage Chinese assertiveness throughout Southeast
Asia.]{.underline}

[The most effective U.S. strategy]{.underline} for lowering the risk of
a China-Vietnam military crisis [is one that combines]{.underline} the
following options: using ASEAN to foster multilateral trust-building in
the South China Sea, promoting written and clear guidelines for
addressing maritime disputes, making U.S. policy clearer regarding
treaty allies with South China Sea claims, [bolstering the defense
capabilities of Vietnam and other Southeast Asian partners to deter
increasingly assertive Chinese activities in the South China Sea, and
minimizing U.S. involvement in any China-Vietnam land border
conflict]{.underline}. Though adopting a U.S. strategy that expands the
partnership with Vietnam runs the risk of appearing to China to be a
"containment policy," [the United States should emphasize that it is not
seeking to contain China's growing power throughout Asia, as evidenced
by the United States limiting its defense cooperation with Vietnam to
naval cooperation. More specifically]{.underline}, the United States
should take the following steps: [Encourage China and Vietnam to move
forward on their MOU for resolving maritime disputes]{.underline}. The
United States should encourage both sides to resume negotiations toward
agreed-upon rules for handling China-Vietnam maritime disputes. ♣ [Make
a South China Sea code of conduct a priority of U.S.
diplomacy]{.underline}. U.S. officials, including President Barack
Obama, should use visits to East Asia to demonstrate U.S. support for
regular ChinaASEAN negotiations on a South China Sea code of conduct.
The U.S. ambassador to ASEAN should make a unified ASEAN position on a
code of conduct a top priority of her mission. ♣ [Clarify U.S. positions
on defending partners in the South China Sea]{.underline}. The United
States should use public statements to more clearly define the U.S.
commitment to defending Philippine forces in disputed areas if they come
under unprovoked attack. ♣ [Expand the U.S.-Vietnam defense
relationship.]{.underline} The United States should work to expand
access for American naval vessels at Cam Ranh Bay and increase the
number of training programs for senior Vietnamese officers, in
preparation for U.S.-Vietnam naval exercises in the future. Boosting
training could be accomplished by doubling the number of Vietnamese
enrolled in United States' International Military Education and Training
programs by 2020 and by inviting more senior Vietnamese officers to
observe the annual Cobra Gold multinational Asian exercises held in
Thailand. [The United States should also increase lethal arms sales to
Vietnam, although these sales should be limited to naval and air
assets]{.underline}. The Obama administration could set up an
interagency working group to approve the first year or two years of arms
sales to Vietnam, [monitoring the sales to make sure that the weapons
are not being used against Vietnamese civilians]{.underline}. ♣ [Bolster
relationships with other Southeast Asian partners]{.underline}. The
United States should strengthen deterrence in the South China Sea by
formalizing and expanding the already close U.S. relationships with
[Singapore and the Philippines]{.underline}. The United States should
build on the 2014 ten-year Enhanced Defense Cooperation Act signed
between Washington and Manila by increasing the size of the annual
U.S.-Philippines Balikatan joint exercises from around eleven thousand
participants to as many as twenty thousand by 2020 and by improving the
interoperability of forces. With Singapore, the United States should, in
secret, approach the Singaporean government about the possibility of
signing a formal treaty alliance. ♣ [Signal to Hanoi that the United
States is not prepared to extend cooperation to a land border
conflict]{.underline}. The United States should signal to Hanoi that
closer U.S.-Vietnam strategic cooperation will not include a U.S.
defense of Vietnam's land border---[unless Vietnam is attacked,
unprovoked]{.underline}---by limiting future U.S.-Vietnam joint
exercises to naval exercises and air exercises in the South China Sea.

Importantly, the transfer of items above a certain value also requires
the approval of Congress, which helps ensure a generally broad support

United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, opinion authored
by Judge Anne Claire Williams of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals,
Heinz v. Cent. Laborers\' Pension Fund, 303 F.3d 802, Decided September
13, 2002

[We conclude that plaintiffs\' loss of the option of working as
construction supervisors was a **reduction** of their]{.underline} early
retirement [benefits]{.underline} within the meaning of § 1054(g)(2).
HN6 [A participant\'s **benefits** **cannot be understood without**
reference to the **conditions** **imposed on receiving** **those
benefits**, and an amendment **placing materially greater restrictions**
on the **receipt** of the benefit \"**reduces**\" the benefit **just as
surely** **as a decrease in the size** of the monthly benefit payment.
We **have not before** interpreted]{.underline} the prohibition in
[the]{.underline} anti-cutback [rule as limited to amendments that
reduce the **amount**]{.underline} of the periodic payment, [and we find
**nothing** in the language]{.underline} of the rule [that suggests such
an interpretation]{.underline}. In Ahng, \[\*\*10\] for example, we held
that the plaintiffs had stated a claim for violation of § 1054(g) when
they alleged that a \[\*806\] plan amendment changed the deadline by
which the employee must retire in order to receive supplemental early
retirement benefits. 96 F.3d at 1036-37; see also Bellas v. CBS, Inc.,
221 F.3d 517 (3d Cir. 2000) (plan amendment that changed eligibility
requirements for early retirement benefits violated § 1054(g)).
Similarly, in Michael v. Riverside Cement Co. Pension Plan, 266 F.3d
1023, 1027-28 (9th Cir. 2001), the Ninth Circuit held that an amendment
that eliminated the plan\'s \"no-offset rule,\" which had allowed a
participant to receive full early retirement benefits without regard to
the amount he already received upon previous retirement, violated §
1054(g) even though the amendment increased the plaintiff\'s monthly
benefit payment. Cf. Hickey, 980 F.2d at 468 (7th Cir. 1992) (plan
amendment that eliminated the particiant\'s right to cost-of-living
adjustments violated the anti-cutback rule). [The Fund argues
that]{.underline} [these cases are **distinguishable** because a change
in the **eligibility requirements**]{.underline}, as in Ahng \[\*\*11\]
[for example, **differs** from a change in the **conditions triggering
suspension** of benefit]{.underline} payments [in that the former
**permanently reduces** benefits or **eliminates** certain]{.underline}
participants\' rights to [benefits, whereas a **suspension** is
**temporary**]{.underline}. **[We find the distinction
unconvincing]{.underline}**. [Although with a suspension the
**interruption** in benefit]{.underline} payments [is temporary, the
retiree **never recovers** **the payments lost** during the]{.underline}
employment [period. The amendment thus \"**eliminates**]{.underline}\"
monthly benefit [payments for participants who take certain jobs after
retirement and \"**reduces**\" the participant\'s **total**]{.underline}
early retirement [benefits by an amount determined by how long
the]{.underline} [disqualifying]{.underline} work [continues. Plaintiffs
**lost** a valuable right they had earned **before**]{.underline} the
amendment\--the right to continue to work in the industry while
receiving monthly benefit payments\-- [and **that loss** **was
permanent**]{.underline}. 5Link to the text of the note \[\*\*12\] [In
our judgment, **this was a reduction** of]{.underline} early retirement
[benefits within the **plain meaning**]{.underline} of § 1054(g)(2).
6Link to the text of the note \[\*\*13\] \[\*807\] B. Spacek v. Maritime
Association The Fund points out, however, that \"suspensions\" are not
identified along with the prohibitions against decreases, reductions,
and elimination of benefits in the anti-cutback rule. The Fund relies on
Spacek v. Maritime Ass\'n, 134 F.3d 283 (5th Cir. 1998), in which the
Fifth Circuit concluded that an amendment like the one in this case did
not violate the anti-cutback rule because it concerned a \"suspension\"
and not a \"reduction\" in benefits. 7Link to the text of the note The
Fifth Circuit supported its conclusion with: (1) an examination of the
use of the two terms under the statute and related regulations; (2) the
legislative history of the Retirement Equity Act; and (3) a Treasury
regulation concerning the effect of suspensions on \"accrued benefits.\"
We respectfully conclude, however, that the Fifth Circuit\'s arguments
do not support its conclusion. \[\*\*14\] 1. Suspensions and reductions
under ERISA. In Spacek, the court noted that \"throughout the statute
and corresponding regulations, the concepts of reduction of benefits and
suspension of benefit payments are used in distinct ways, often within a
single provision.\" 134 F.3d at 288-89 (citing 29 U.S.C. §§ 1441(a),
1341a(d) & 1342(d)(1)(A)(v); 29 C.F.R. § 2520.104b-4(a)(1)(iii)). From
this the court reasoned that to interpret the prohibition in the
anti-cutback rule against amendments that reduce benefits as applying to
suspensions would \"make the word \'suspension\' redundant in all of
these statutory provisions and interpretive regulations.\" Spacek, 134
F.3d at 289. This redundancy, according to Spacek, would violate the
canon of statutory construction that every word in a statute must be
given meaning. Id. We disagree with the inference that Spacek draws from
the various provisions that refer to both reductions and suspensions.
Our interpretation of the anti-cutback rule does not suggest that all
suspensions are \"reductions\" (or vice versa), only that if the
suspension is pursuant \[\*\*15\] to an amendment that reduces benefits
(attributable to service before the amendment), then it is a reduction
within the anti-cutback rule. This interpretation does not render the
word \"suspension\" in the other provisions redundant. For example,
Spacek relies on various provisions in Title IV of ERISA (relating to
financially troubled and terminated plans) that refer to both
\"reduction of benefits\" and \"suspension of benefit payments\";
according to Spacek, to avoid redundancy, the former phrase must be
construed as excluding the latter. Id. But Spacek\'s identification of
the two relevant phrases is too narrow; to the extent the Title IV
provisions identify two separate categories, they are amendments that
reduce benefits on the one hand, and suspension \[\*808\] of benefit
payments, on the other. Section 1441, governing plan terminations, is
typical: (a) Amendment of plan by plan sponsor to reduce benefits, and
suspension of benefit payments Notwithstanding sections 1053 and 1054 of
this title, the plan sponsor of a terminated multiemployer plan to which
section 1341a(d) of this title applies shall amend the plan to reduce
benefits, and shall suspend \[\*\*16\] benefit payments, as required by
this section. 29 U.S.C. § 1441(a) (emphasis added) 8Link to the text of
the note \[\*\*17\] ;see also 29 U.S.C. § 1425(a)(1) & 26 U.S.C. §
418D(a)(1) (plans in reorganization may amend the plan to reduce
benefits); 29 U.S.C. § 1426(a) & 26 U.S.C. § 418E(a) (insolvent plans
may suspend benefit payments); 29 U.S.C. § 1053 (a)(3)(E)(ii) & 26
U.S.C. § 411(a)(3)(F) (exception to forfeiture rule for amendments that
reduce benefits under §§ 1441 or 1425, and suspension of benefit
payments under §§ 1441 and 1426). Because the latter category
(suspension of benefit payments) includes suspensions not according to
any amendment, as in the case of insolvent plans, for example, it is not
rendered superfluous by interpreting the amendment in this case as
falling into the former category (amendments that reduce benefits).
9Link to the text of the note In other words, even crediting the
reliability of any inference about the anti-cutback rule that can be
drawn from the use of these phrases in various provisions relating to
terminated or troubled plans, the most we can infer is that a suspension
of benefit payments not falling into the first category\--amendments
that reduce benefits\--should be excluded from the anti-cutback rule.
But other than in the case of insolvent or terminated plans, an
administrator\'s authority to suspend benefits must come from the plan.
\[\*\*18\] And as we noted before, no one is disputing that the
suspension in this case would be proper if it were contained in the
original plan. It is the propriety of the amendment to the plan that is
at issue in this case, and not the suspension itself, and therefore we
cannot infer from the distinction made in Title IV between suspensions
of benefit payments and amendments that reduce benefits that the
amendment in this case is beyond the anti-cutback rule. 10Link to the
text of the note \[\*\*19\] \[\*809\] We do not view the omission of a
specific reference to suspensions in the anti-cutback rule as an
oversight, but as unnecessary. Adding a reference to suspensions in §
1054(g)(1) (e.g., \"The accrued benefit of a participant under a plan
may not be decreased \[or suspended\] by an amendment of the plan\") or
§ 1054(g)(2) (e.g., \"a plan amendment which has the effect of
...eliminating\[,\] reducing\[, or suspending\] an early retirement
benefit ...\"), would be awkward and perhaps overbroad; it is not the
suspension of benefit payments that offends the anti-cutback rule, but
the change (to the detriment of the participant) in the conditions
triggering the suspension, and this concept is adequately captured by
the prohibition against amendments that reduce benefits. 2. Legislative
history of the Retirement Equity Act. The Fund, again relying on Spacek,
also points to the legislative history of the Retirement Equity Act of
1984, which added paragraph (2)\--the provision concerning amendments
that reduce or eliminate early retirement benefits\--to § 1054(g). See
Spacek, 134 F.3d at 289-90. Spacek found instructive the following
comment made \[\*\*20\] by Representative William Clay during the final
House debates on the Retirement Equity Act: Nor do those provisions in
any way apply to or affect the provisions of ERISA section 203(a)(3)(B)
and code section 411(a)(3)(B) relating to the suspension of benefits for
post-retirement employment, including the authorization for
multiemployer plans to adopt stricter rules for the suspension of
subsidized early retirement benefits. Spacek, 134 F.3d at 289 (quoting
130 Cong. Rec. 23,487 (1984)). The Fifth Circuit concluded that
Representative Clay\'s remark means that the anti-cutback rule in §
1054(g) does not limit the power of the plan to amend the plan to expand
the restrictions on post-retirement employment. See Spacek, 134 F.3d at
289-90. We find Representative Clay\'s remark ambiguous at best on the
question of whether amendments concerning suspensions for disqualifying
employment are outside the coverage of § 1054(g). 11Link to the text of
the note \[\*\*23\] But even if Representative Clay\'s understanding of
the anti-cutback rule were consistent with the Fifth Circuit\'s\--that
suspensions upon disqualifying re-employment represent an additional
exception to § 1054(g)\--we \[\*\*21\] find nothing in the legislative
history to indicate that anyone else in Congress shared the
understanding attributed to Representative Clay by the Fifth Circuit.
The parties have not identified, \[\*810\] and we have been unable to
find, any further reference in the legislative history of the Retirement
Equity Act to the exception for suspensions that the Fifth Circuit
infers from Representative Clay\'s remarks. 12Link to the text of the
note The absence of any additional support in the legislative history
suggests to us that the Fifth Circuit gave undue weight to the statement
of Representative Clay, which (as interpreted by the Fifth Circuit) is
at odds with the straightforward language of the statute. See Barnhart
v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.S. 438, 122 S. Ct. 941, 953-54, 151 L. Ed. 2d
908 (2002) (rejecting interpretation contained in the floor statements
of the statute\'s sponsors); Monterey Coal Co. v. Federal Mine Safety
and Health Review Comm\'n, 743 F.2d 589, 596 (7th Cir. 1984) (same);
Alex v. City of Chicago, 29 F.3d 1235, 1239 n.3 (7th Cir. 1994)
(\"Isolated remarks of individual legislators, ...\[can\] not be used to
find ambiguity, or contrary intent, in statutory \[\*\*22\] language
that, with respect to a case in hand, is clear on its own terms without
rendering nugatory the \'plain meaning\' canon of construction.\").
13Link to the text of the note Accordingly, we conclude that
Representative Clay\'s remarks cannot be used to support an exception to
the anti-cutback rule for amendments that expand disqualifying
employment. 3. Treasury Regulation 26 C.F.R. § 1.411(c)-1(f). The court
in Spacek also found support in 26 C.F.R. § 1.411(c)-1(f), a Treasury
Department regulation concerning the allocation of accrued benefits
between employer and employee contributions. By way of background, the
court first noted that the term \"accrued benefit\" means the
employees\' benefit as accrued under \[\*\*24\] the plan, expressed in
the form of \"an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age,\"
29 U.S.C. § 1002(23), 14Link to the text of the note or, for early
retirement benefits, the actuarial equivalent of the benefit commencing
at normal retirement age. See Spacek, 134 F.3d at 290 (citing 29 U.S.C.
§ 1054(c)(3); 26 C.F.R. § 1.411(c) -1(e)). 15Link to the text of the
note The Treasury regulation relied upon by Spacek, 26 C.F.R. §
1.411(c)-1(f)(1), states that in calculating the actuarial equivalent of
an accrued benefit, \"no adjustment ...is required on account of any
suspension of benefits\" if the suspension is permitted under ERISA §
203(a)(3)(B)\--the section dealing with restrictions on post-retirement
employment. 16Link to the text of the note According to the \[\*811\]
Fifth Circuit, \"because [the reduction in total benefits paid over the
lifetime of the plan participant as a result of the suspension **need
not** be accounted for **actuarially**]{.underline} in computing the
participant\'s accrued benefit,\" an amendment \"authorizing such a
suspension does not serve to decrease the participant\'s accrued
benefits, and thus cannot violate § 1054(g).\" 134 F.3d at 291.

the Paris Climate Accord, **[12/14]{.underline}**/15,
gizmodo.com/a-single-typo-nearly-killed-the-paris-climate-accord-1747908970

Hours before the historic Paris climate accord was to be ratified in a
final vote, someone noticed that a word had been changed in the final
draft of the text---a single word that threatened to derail the entire
deal.

As reported in the Washington Post, someone changed the word "should" to
"shall." Now, it seems like a little thing, but given that the words
were in reference to sweeping new legal and financial obligations, it
mattered. A lot.

[When it comes to **legally binding terminology**]{.underline},
**[there's a big difference between "should" and "shall."]{.underline}**
Whereas **["should" is a kind of wishy-washy call to
action,]{.underline}** [the word "shall" implies an
obligation]{.underline}, and this is why Secretary of State John Kerry
could not abide the unexpected change. The New York Times reports:

Throughout the process, [the longer and less binding
"should"]{.underline} [was a deliberate part of the international
agreement,]{.underline} [put there to establish that the richest
countrie]{.underline}s, including the United States, [felt obligated to
pony up money]{.underline} to help poor countries adapt to climate
change and make the transition to sustainable energy systems. ["Shall"
meant something **altogether different**]{.underline}, American
officials said.

[When "shall" was spotted]{.underline} in the document on Saturday,
Secretary of State John [Kerry]{.underline} [called his French
counterpart and made it clear]{.underline} that [unless a switch was
made]{.underline}, [France could not count on American
support]{.underline} for the agreement.

"I said: 'We cannot do this and we will not do this. And either it
changes, or President Obama and the United States will not be able to
support this agreement,' " Mr. Kerry told reporters after delegates had
accepted the deal by consensus Saturday night, amid cheering and the
celebratory stamping of feet.

Thankfully, cooler heads prevailed, and within hours the wording within
the 31-page text was reverted back to the original "should." A
subsequent vote affirmed the Paris Accord, and all was saved.

**[Goodman 15]{.underline}**

Colby Goodman, Acting Director at Security Assistance Monitor and
focuses on a range of U.S. military aid and arms sales policy and
research issues, Defense Experts Highlight Effectiveness of Human Rights
Conditioning, 12/10/15,
<http://securityassistance.org/blog/defense-experts-highlight-effectiveness-human-rights-conditioning>

Challenging a longtime U.S. military critique of security assistance,
some [defense experts are saying **suspending U.S. military aid** to
foreign security forces because of their poor human rights record has
**often caused**]{.underline} an [**improvement** in the force's
behavior. This]{.underline} point, which was raised at a House Armed
Services Committee hearing in October, appears to
[contradict]{.underline} military [views]{.underline} [that suspending
aid for such reasons is counterproductive]{.underline}.

[For years, U.S. defense experts have seen cutting off U.S. military aid
to certain repressive foreign security forces as
ineffective]{.underline} because it harms U.S. national security
imperatives and eliminates opportunities to provide them with human
rights training to improve their record. At a meeting in Nigeria this
year, former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates indicated that U.S.
requirements to suspend military aid to abusive forces in Nigeria have
frustrated efforts to address terrorism.

Commenting on restricting military aid to Nigeria, U.S. Vice Admiral
Charles Leidig said "the conundrum it presents us is that the nations
whose militaries have had human rights violations perhaps are the ones
that need U.S. engagement the most." Other U.S. officials have pointed
to instances in which human rights training helped. After providing
military training to professionalize Croatian security forces with a
poor human rights record in the mid-1990s, for instance, U.S. military
personnel claimed the training helped improve their actions after a new
government took power.

Nigeria Security Assistance

[According to a RAND]{.underline} Corporation [study, however,
**suspending military aid**]{.underline} [for human rights or other
reasons **does "not** have the devastating consequences" that opponents
might expect. The study highlights that]{.underline}, in some cases,
U.S. [**punitive funding cuts** of military aid **have
improved**]{.underline} [foreign]{.underline} **[partner
behavior]{.underline}**. Out of ten cases of punitive funding cuts the
study examined over the past 20 years, it determined that three
"resulted in significant improvement."

The study did not disclose the names of the countries they reviewed.
Research does point to Indonesia in the early 2000s as a potential
example of when suspension of security assistance resulted in an
improvement of military force behavior. In 1999, the U.S. suspended all
aid to the Indonesian armed forces, due to reports of gross human rights
abuses in East Timor, Aceh, and other regions. Following this
suspension, and after the resignation of President Suhatro, basic
freedoms in the country proceeded to expand rapidly, contributing "to a
vibrant if chaotic democracy."

[The suspension of military aid to Egypt is likely an example of when
funding cuts didn't result in improved human rights
behavior]{.underline}, perhaps [**because** **of the way in which the
United States went about it**.]{.underline} After the July 2013 military
coup, President [Obama didn't formally suspend a portion of U.S.
military aid until **several months later**]{.underline}. [This delay
was]{.underline} explained by many as [an **attempt to maintain good
relations**]{.underline} with the new government **[while
also]{.underline}** slowly [prodding it towards democratization. It
was]{.underline} also [relatively **clear** that the **suspension would
only be temporary**, **undercutting the real threat** of cutting the
funding.]{.underline}

The RAND study also found that when the United States cuts military aid
to foreign security force, their military capabilities are negatively
affected. However, it indicated that the blow to a state's security
capacity is perhaps less damaging than previously thought, for two
possible reasons. Firstly, in some cases, it takes time for a government
to lose military capability, as donated equipment and weapons can remain
fully functional for decades. Secondly, the United States does not
always cuts all types of aid to a foreign force.

For instance, some military aid to Nigeria was cut in 2014 on account of
Nigeria's abysmal human rights record and rampant corruption. Yet, the
Obama Administration still allocated \$4.4 million in security
assistance to Nigerian forces in FY 2015. This was even before Nigerians
elected a new President, Muhammadu Buhari, who pledged investigations
into military abuses and a reform of the Nigeria security sector.

Human rights groups have also fired back at officials who argue that the
United States must sometimes assist repressive security forces in order
to address terrorism. Advocates have cited that Nigerian security force
abuses against civilians have unintentionally aided Boko Haram's cause
and recruitment efforts. By supporting such forces, U.S. security
assistance to Nigeria can in fact prove counterproductive to fighting
terrorism.

As [the RAND Corporation is a **widely respected voice** in defense
analysis]{.underline}, this new study may signal a new openness within
the defense community for suspending military aid because of concerns
for human rights violations. The findings could also support those
within Congress and the Obama Administration who are pushing to maintain
the Leahy Law, which restricts U.S. military aid to specific units on
the basis of credible evidence of gross human rights violations, in its
current form.

### 2ac reduce k2 signal

#### Only actually ENDING these sales can make threats EFFECTIVE

**[Spindel 19]{.underline}**

Jennifer Spindel, Assistant Professor of International Security at the
University of Oklahoma and the Associate Director of the Cyber
Governance and Policy Center, 14 May 2019,
<https://warontherocks.com/2019/05/the-case-for-suspending-american-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia/>

[Arms embargos are often dismissed as symbolic]{.underline}, and
therefore ineffective. [But]{.underline} just because something is
[symbolic, doesn't mean that it won't have an effect. A U.S. arms
embargo against Saudi]{.underline} Arabia [would be a **clear signal**
of American disproval of Saudi actions in Yemen]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} would be [an equally important signal to Washington's
allies]{.underline}, who are left wondering if the United States is
ambivalent or uninterested in the growing Yemeni humanitarian
catastrophe.

[By continuing to provide weapons]{.underline}, President Donald T[rump
tacitly endorses Saudi policies. This signal is strengthened by
Trump's]{.underline} recent [veto of the resolution that called for an
end to U.S. support for the war in Yemen]{.underline}. While Trump
justified the veto by saying that the resolution was a "dangerous
attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities," statements from
[Congressional representatives]{.underline} show they [are aware of the
powerful signals sent by arms sales]{.underline}. Sen. Tim Kaine said
that the veto "shows the world \[Trump\] is determined to keep aiding a
Saudi-backed war that has killed thousands of civilians and pushed
millions more to the brink of starvation." [An arms **embargo** against
Saud]{.underline}i Arabia [would be a signal both to **leaders of that
country**, and other states, that the United States does not endorse
Saudi actions]{.underline}. Those arguing against a ban are correct on
one point: [Embargos as blunt force]{.underline} instruments of
[coercion are rarely effective. But]{.underline} arms
[embargos]{.underline} [are **effective**]{.underline} as [signals
of]{.underline} political [dissatisfaction, and serve an important
**communication role** in international politics]{.underline}.

Arms Embargos Are Signals and Can Build Coalitions

[**Policymakers and scholars agree** that arms **embargoes are not
effective "sticks**]{.underline}" [in international
politics.]{.underline} [**Rarely do states cave when faced with
punishment** in the form of an embargo. But]{.underline} even if an arms
embargo isn't a direct tool of coercion, [an embargo would be an
important political signal]{.underline}. There are at least two reasons
for the United States to seriously consider an arms embargo against
Saudi Arabia.

First, [arms sales are **signals** that **cut through the noise** of the
international system. **Cutting off arms transfers**]{.underline} is a
common way that states [express]{.underline} their
[dissatisfaction]{.underline} with others [and]{.underline} try to
**[influence behavior]{.underline}**. As Lawrence Freedman observed in
1978, "[refusing to sell arms is a **major** political act]{.underline}.
It appears as [a **calculated insult**, reflecting on]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} stability, **[trust, and
credit-worthiness]{.underline}**, or technical competence [of the
would-be recipient]{.underline}." Yet this crucial point seems to have
been lost in the current policy debate about whether or not the United
States should continue selling arms to Saudi Arabia. [My **research
shows** that **stopping** arms transfers]{.underline} or denying
requests [is an **effective way to signal**]{.underline} dissatisfaction
and **[causes the would-be recipient to re-think their
behavior.]{.underline}**

Take, [for example]{.underline}, the U.S. relationship with Israel [in
the 1960s]{.underline}. The United States sold Israel Hawk
surface-to-surface missiles in 1962, M-48 Patton tanks in 1964 and 1965,
and A-4E Skyhawk bombers in 1966. [Israeli leaders understood
that]{.underline} these [transfers signaled a close U.S.-Israeli
relationship]{.underline}. As diplomat Abba Eban wrote, the [arms
transfers were]{.underline} "a development [of tremendous political
value]{.underline}." Even against this backdrop of close ties and
significant arms sales, [Israeli leaders were extremely sensitive to
arms transfer denials. In]{.underline} April and May [1967, the United
States denied]{.underline} Israeli [requests]{.underline} for armored
personnel carriers and fighter jets. [Approving the transfers would have
signaled support, and]{.underline} likely [emboldened Israel, as
tensions were growing]{.underline} in the region. [Israeli leaders
believed these transfer denials overruled prior signals and demonstrated
that the United States was not willing to be a close]{.underline}
political [ally]{.underline} for Israel. Eban described Israel as
"isolated," and [the head of Israel's intelligence service said that the
arms]{.underline} transfer [denials made]{.underline} it [**clear** that
"in Israel, there existed **certain misperceptions** \[about the United
States\]." If arms transfer denials could have such a significant effect
on Israeli thinking --- keeping in mind]{.underline} that [there was a
close and significant political relationship]{.underline} between the US
and Israel --- [imagine what a transfer denial would mean for
U.S.-**Saudi** relations. Like Israel]{.underline}, [Saudi]{.underline}
Arabia [would **have to re-think** its impression that **it has
political support and approval from the United States**]{.underline}. We
can, and should, ask whether or not withdrawal of U.S. support would
affect Saudi behavior, but it's important that this question not get
overlooked in the current debate.

[Because arms]{.underline} transfers (and [denials) are powerful
signals, they]{.underline} can [have an effect even **before** a
transfer is **actually completed**. This suggests that even the
announcement of an embargo against Saudi]{.underline} Arabia [could
have]{.underline} an [effect]{.underline}. [Take, for example, Taiwan's
recent request for]{.underline} a fleet of new fighter jets. As reports
mounted that Trump had given "tacit approval" to a deal for F-16 jets,
China's protests increased. The United States has not sold advanced
fighter jets to Taiwan since 1992, partially out of fear of angering
China, which views Taiwan as a renegade province. Even if the deal for
[F-16s]{.underline} is formally approved, Taiwan is unlikely to see the
jets until at least 2021, and [the balance of power between China and
Taiwan would not change]{.underline}. As one researcher observed, the
sale would be a "huge shock" for Beijing, "[But it would be]{.underline}
more of [a **political shock**]{.underline} than a military shock. It
would be, 'Oh, the U.S. doesn't care how we feel.' It would be more of a
symbolic or emotional issue." Yet [China's immediate, negative
reaction]{.underline} [to even the **announcement** of a potential deal
shows how powerful arms transfer signals can be.]{.underline}

If [this same logic is applied to an arms embargo against Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}, [an arms embargo would signal that **Saudi Arabia
does not have the support of the United States**]{.underline}. [This
signal would be an **important first step**]{.underline} [in **changing
Saudi behavior** **because** it would **override other statements and
actions**]{.underline} [the United States has sent that **indicate
support**. And **Trump has given Saudi Arabia a number of positive
signals**: He called Saudi]{.underline} Arabia [a "great ally" and
dismissed reports]{.underline} that that [the]{.underline} Saudi
[government was involved in the murder of]{.underline} journalist Jamal
[Khashoggi. He]{.underline} has [expressed interested in selling
nuclear]{.underline} power plants and [tech]{.underline}nology [to
Saudi]{.underline} Arabia. [And he has repeatedly claimed that he has
made a \$110 billion arms deal with Saudi]{.underline} Arabia ([he
hasn't). **With these clear signals of support**]{.underline}, **[why
should Saudi Arabia alter its behavior based on
resolutions]{.underline}** [that come out of the House or
Senate]{.underline}, which are likely to be vetoed by Trump, anyway? [An
**arms embargo**]{.underline} [would be a **clear and unambiguous
signal** that the United States disproves of]{.underline} Saudi [actions
in Yemen.]{.underline}

The second reason for supporting an embargo concerns U.S. allies and the
logistical difficulties of making an embargo have an effect. One of the
reasons embargoes have little material impact is because they require
cooperation among weapons exporting states. A ban on sales from one
country will have little effect if the target of the embargo can seek
arms elsewhere. Germany, instituted an arms ban against Riyadh in
November 2018, and German leaders have pressured other European states
to stop selling arms to the Saudis. Germany understands the importance
of the embargo as a political signal: as a representative of the German
Green Party explained, "The re-start of arms exports to Saudi Arabia
would be a fatal foreign policy signal and would contribute to the
continued destabilization of the Middle East." But the German embargo
has had minimal effect because Saudi Arabia can get arms elsewhere.

According to the 2019 Military Balance, most of Saudi Arabia's equipment
is American or French in origin, such as the M1A2 Abrams and AMX-30
tanks, Apache and Dauphin helicopters, and F-15C/D fighter jets. Saudi
Arabia has some equipment manufactured wholly or in part in Germany,
such as the Eurofighter Typhoon and the Tornado ground attack craft, but
these weapons are a small portion of its complete arsenal. A U.S.
embargo would send an important signal to the allies who also supply
Saudi Arabia, allowing them to explain participation in the embargo to
their own domestic constituencies. This is especially important for
countries like France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, that need to
export arms to keep their own production lines running. While the
research shows that sustaining an arms embargo is often the most
difficult step, embargoes can restrain sending states' arms exports.
Even if a U.S. embargo won't have a direct effect on Saudi Arabia on its
own, an embargo is important for building coalitions for a more
expansive embargo that could affect Saudi behavior.

The Difficulty of Stopping Atrocities

Beyond signaling, we know U.S. arms sales often end up in the wrong
hands, and have been used in Yemen. The Saudi-led war in Yemen has led
to starvation conditions, caused thousands of civilian casualties, and
has led to the displacement of millions of people. The United Nations
estimates that 80 percent of Yemen's population -- 24 million people --
require some form of humanitarian or protection assistance, and that the
severity of the situation is increasing. Would an arms embargo create
meaningful change in Yemen?

[An initial effect of an embargo is that Saudi Arabia would have to work
harder to access war materiel]{.underline}. As Jonathan Caverley noted,
more than 60 percent of Saudi Arabia's arms delivered in the past five
years came from the United States. Even if this percentage decreases
over time, [it will be costly for Saudi Arabia to transition to a
primarily Russian- or Chinese-supplied military. Though
Saudi]{.underline} Arabia [might be willing to]{.underline} pay this
cost, [it would]{.underline} still have to pay, and
**[take]{.underline}** the **[time]{.underline}** to transition to its
new weapons systems. [This would represent a]{.underline} brief **[break
in hostilities]{.underline}** that could facilitate the delivery of aid
and assistance in Yemen.

The United States could, in theory, impose stricter end-user controls on
Saudi Arabia. This would have the advantage of keeping Saudi Arabia
within the world of U.S. weapons systems, and might prevent it from
diversifying its suppliers, which would ultimately weaken any leverage
the United States might have. Longer-term, it would not be to America's
advantage if Saudi Arabia takes a lesson from Turkey, and starts
courting Russia as a new arms supplier. It is difficult to enforce
end-user controls, since, once a weapon is transferred, the recipient
can use it however it wishes. It might also be the case that Saudi
Arabia would object to stricter end-user controls, and would seek new
suppliers as a result.

An arms embargo will not be a panacea. But not doing something sets a
problematic precedent, and allows the difficulty of coordinating an arms
embargo outweigh the potential benefits of one. An embargo is unlikely
to have an immediate effect on Saudi behavior, [because an embargo would
be a political signal, rather than a blunt instrument of
coercion]{.underline}. It will take time for a multilateral embargo to
emerge and be put into place, and the United States should work with its
allies to help support their ability to participate in the embargo. [Not
**acting**]{.underline}, however, [would continue to **implicitly
endorse Saudi behavior**]{.underline}, [and would **make
it**]{.underline} more **[difficult]{.underline}** for U.S. allies **[to
believe that]{.underline}** future **[threats of an embargo are
credible.]{.underline}**

[Following the 9/11 attacks, in which 15 of]{.underline} the
[19]{.underline} [hijackers were Saudi]{.underline}, many in the U.S.
raised the issue of terrorist financing from wealthy private donors, and
perhaps even the government itself, in Saudi Arabia. [The]{.underline}
9[/11 Commission Report acknowledged that]{.underline} charities based
in [Saudi]{.underline} Arabia [provided funds to Al-Qaeda]{.underline}
[but "found no evidence that the Saudi government" was directly
involved. However]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} Bush [administration
excised]{.underline} [28 pages of findings on the subject
of]{.underline} possible [Saudi involvement]{.underline} in the 9/11
attacks, citing national security concerns. [Current and former members
of Congress say those]{.underline} 28 [pages contain direct evidence of
complicity on the part of]{.underline} certain [Saudi
officials]{.underline} and entities. At the same time, Gulf monarchies
view these terrorist groups as a serious threat. But the Saudi state is
inhibited in dealing with terrorist financing, as it cannot afford to
estrange the powerful clerical establishment that permeates society and
is comparatively unabashed about funding jihadists. [Qatar is another
notable culprit]{.underline}. "Qatar is believed to have directly
supported some of the most radical groups fighting in the Syrian war
through much of 2013," writes Lori Plotkin Boghardt, a fellow at the
Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Despite U.S. objections,
Qatar "still tolerates private fundraising for Al Qaeda, ISIS, and other
radical organizations." Fundraisers in Kuwait, the UAE, and Oman "are
soliciting donations to fund extremist insurgents, not to meet
legitimate humanitarian needs," David Cohen, Treasury undersecretary for
terrorism and financial intelligence, recently told NBC News. \"The
recipients of these funds are often terrorist groups, including al
Qaeda's Syrian affiliate, al-Nusrah Front, and the Islamic State of Iraq
and the Levant \[ISIS\].\" Attempts to pressure the Arab Gulf states to
cut off the flow of support to terrorist groups have proven largely
ineffective. A 2002 Council on Foreign Relations report noted that Saudi
Arabia responded to pressure from the Bush administration to "tighten
controls over the flow of funds in or through the kingdom." Still, the
same report criticized Saudi Arabia's "failure to punish, in a
demonstrable manner, specific and identified leaders of charities found
to be funneling money to militant Islamist organizations." In addition
to problems of enforcement, Saudi Arabia appears to revive financing for
militant groups when faced with overwhelming national interests. As
Biden indicated, the opportunity to take advantage of the Syrian civil
war took precedence over concerns about terrorist financing. Qatar has
also half-heartedly yielded to U.S. pressure. Foreign Policy recently
reported that Qatar responded to Treasury Department accusations of
terrorist financing when it "instituted a new law to regulate charities
and prevent them from engaging in politics." Unfortunately, as Foreign
Policy went on to note, Doha continues to play "a major role in
destabilizing every trouble spot in the region and in accelerating the
growth in radical and jihadi factions." Over the course of several
decades, these regimes have shown that they consider it a vital national
interest to placate their domestic fundamentalist religious
constituencies and to fight for Sunni Arab dominance in the Middle East
by proxy, even at the risk of jeopardizing their relationship with the
United States. [Fighting terrorism is a top priority in
Washington]{.underline} and it continues to be the foremost reason cited
in nearly every military intervention. [So, what explains Washington's
tolerance of Middle East allies that support extremist groups?
Longstanding precepts dating back to]{.underline} the end of [World War
II continue to influence U.S. foreign policy towards the Middle East. On
its perch as the most dominant]{.underline} military and economic
[state]{.underline} in the post-war international system, [the U.S.
initiated strategies that demanded a global military presence. As a top
secret National Security Council briefing put it]{.underline} in 1954,
"[the Near East is of great strategic]{.underline}, [political, and
economic importance," as it "contains the greatest petroleum resources
in the world" as well as "essential locations for strategic military
bases in any world conflict."]{.underline} U.S. control of the energy
rich region was necessary to prevent the rise of any regional hegemon
that could dominate the oil resources and disrupt either the flow or the
price of oil exports. [Currying favor with Persian Gulf regimes
is]{.underline} also [considered essential to maintaining U.S. power
projection]{.underline} in the region. [The]{.underline} Navy's [Fifth
Fleet in Bahrain enables]{.underline} [the U.S. to patrol the Strait of
Hormuz, through which 35 percent of]{.underline} the world's seaborne
traded [oil passes, and signal to]{.underline} [potential belligerents,
like Iran, that any attempt to block the strait would be met with
force]{.underline}. Similarly[, the U.S. Air Force's biggest base in the
region]{.underline}, based [in Qatar, "coordinated all]{.underline} of
the U.S. [attack and surveillance missions for the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan]{.underline}," [and]{.underline} is [now]{.underline}
coordinating U.S. airstrikes [against ISIS]{.underline}. [Washington's
reliance on these military bases creates a certain level of tolerance
for objectionable aspects of the host governments' rule]{.underline},
like tacit support for Islamic jihadists. [Policymakers are also
disinclined to protest unwelcome Gulf state policies because close
relationships can help influence their behavior on crucial matters, like
intelligence cooperation. The Gulf states receive tangible
benefits]{.underline} [from]{.underline} their alliance with [the U.S.
in the form of advanced military equipment]{.underline}, extensive
training programs, protection of their vital natural resources, and the
tacit guarantee that Washington will come to their defense if they are
threatened or attacked. The benefits the U.S. enjoys in return are
trivial by comparison. [The U.S. should not maintain
alliances]{.underline} that are [harmful to U.S. interests
and]{.underline} should [not tolerate terrorist financing by states that
receive substantial U.S. support. Military obligations]{.underline} and
alliance commitments [should therefore be withdrawn]{.underline}. The
U.S. does have interests in the security and supply of oil, but those
interests are often exaggerated and the region's energy resources are
not as vulnerable as is often claimed. Few states have the military
capability to close the Strait of Hormuz and keep it closed, especially
in the face of the overwhelming international military response that
would inevitably rise to counter it. Many world powers have a vital
national interest in keeping the Strait of Hormuz open and none of the
relatively weak states in the Middle East would have an interest in
attracting that kind of vehement global response. What threat there is
to the Strait of Hormuz may actually be exacerbated by America's forward
deployed military posture. As a Cato Institute report noted, the U.S.
military presence in the region "can create new incentives for other
actors to threaten, disrupt, or close strategic chokepoints as a way of
deterring or retaliating against American activities." Thus, as Eugene
Gholz and Daryl G. Press concluded, "the day-to-day peacetime presence
of U.S. military forces in the Persian Gulf region is not merely
ineffective; it is probably counterproductive for protecting U.S. oil
interests." Furthermore, Persian Gulf oil only has a modest impact on
the U.S. economy, accounting for about 20 percent of oil imports. And
even this modest percentage is declining. Total crude oil imports have
declined by 23 percent since 2008, and, according to the U.S. Energy
Information Administration, "net import volumes of crude oil and liquid
fuels on a volume basis are projected to decline by 55 percent between
2012 and 2020." The U.S. is also relatively insulated from sudden
disruptions in supply. In every major oil shock since 1973, global
energy markets adapted rather quickly through increasing production from
other sources, rerouting shipping transportation, and putting both
private and government-held inventories around the world to use.
Washington's client states in the Persian Gulf engage in behavior that
contradicts U.S. interests. [Outdated and misguided ideas about the
importance of our Persian Gulf allies, driven by an imprudent and
expansive grand strategy]{.underline}, [continue to incentivize
policymakers to overlook the substantial costs]{.underline} associated
with them.

### 2AC Leveraging Fails

#### Leveraging fails -- empirics prove international pressure ESPECIALLY from the U.S. fail---unilateral concessions best. 

[**Thrall et al 18** (Trevor Thrall,]{.underline} a senior fellow for
the Cato's Institute's Defense and Foreign Policy Department, with
expertise in international security and the politics of American
national security and an associate professor at George Mason
University's Schar School of Policy and Government where he teaches
courses in international security; Caroline Dorminey, a policy analyst
in defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute also worked
on issues pertaining to the US defense budget, defense politics, force

Business, The Role of Arms Sales in U.S. Foreign Policy,"
<https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor039)>

[The hidden assumption]{.underline} underlying the balance of power
strategy [is that the United States will be able to predict accurately
what the impact of its arms sales will be]{.underline}. If the goal is
deterrence, for example, the assumption is that an arms sale will be
sufficient to deter the adversary without spawning an arms race. [If the
goal is to promote stability, the assumption is that an arms sale will
in fact reduce tensions and inhibit conflict rather than inflame
tensions and help initiate conflict.]{.underline} [These
assumptions]{.underline}, in turn, [depend on both the recipient nation
and that nation's neighbors and adversaries acting in ways that don't
make things worse.]{.underline}

As it turns out, these are often poor assumptions. [Although arms sales
certainly enhance the military capability of the recipient nation, the
fundamental problem is that arms sales often initiate a long chain of
responses that the United States generally cannot control.]{.underline}
The United States, after all, is not the only country with interests in
regional balances, especially where the survival and security of local
actors is at stake. The United States is neither the only major power
with a keen interest in critical regions like Asia and the Middle East,
nor the only source of weapons and other forms of assistance. Nor can it
dictate the perceptions, interests, or actions of the other nations
involved in a given region. For example, [though a nation receiving arms
from the United States may enjoy enhanced defensive capabilities, it is
also likely to enjoy enhanced offensive capabilities.]{.underline} With
these, a nation's calculations about the potential benefits of war,
intervention abroad, or even the use of force against its own population
may shift decisively. Saudi Arabia's recent behavior illustrates this
dynamic. Though the Saudis explain their arms purchases as necessary for
defense against Iranian pressure, Saudi Arabia has also spent the past
two years embroiled in a military intervention in Yemen.

Likewise, [arms sales can heighten regional security
dilemmas]{.underline}. Neighbors of nations buying major conventional
weapons will also worry about what this enhanced military capability
will mean. This raises the chances that they too will seek to arm
themselves further, or take other steps to shift the balance of power
back in their favor, or, in the extreme case, to launch a preventive war
before they are attacked. Given these dynamics, [the consequences of
arms sales to manage regional balances of power are far less predictable
and often much less positive than advocates
assume.]{.underline}[^54^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor054)

This unpredictability characterizes even straightforward-seeming efforts
to manage the balance of power. The most basic claim of arms sales
advocates is that U.S. arms sales to friendly governments and allies
should make them better able to deter adversaries. The best available
evidence, however, suggests a more complicated reality. In a study of
arms sales from 1950 to 1995, major-power arms sales to existing allies
had no effect on the chance that the recipient would be the target of a
military attack. Worse, recipients of U.S. arms that were not treaty
allies were significantly **[more likely]{.underline}** to become
targets.[^55^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor055)

[Nor is there much evidence that arms sales can help the United States
promote peace and regional stability by calibrating the local balance of
power]{.underline}. On this score, in fact, the evidence suggests that
the default assumption should be the opposite. Most scholarly work
concludes that [arms sales exacerbate instability and increase the
likelihood of
conflict]{.underline}.[^56^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor056)One
study, for example, found that during the Cold War, U.S. and Soviet arms
sales to hostile dyads (e.g., India/Pakistan, Iran/Iraq,
Ethiopia/Somalia) "contributed to hostile political relations and
imbalanced military relationships" and were "profoundly
destabilizing."[^57^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor057)

[There is]{.underline} also [good reason]{.underline} to believe that
[several factors are making the promotion of regional stability through
arms sales more difficult]{.underline}. [The shrinking U.S. military
advantage]{.underline} over other powers such as China and the
increasingly competitive global arms market both [make it less likely
that U.S. arms sales can make a decisive difference]{.underline}. As
William Hartung argued as early as 1990, "the notion of using arms
transfers to maintain a carefully calibrated regional balance of power
seems increasingly archaic in today's arms market, in which a potential
U.S. adversary is as likely to be receiving weapons from U.S. allies
like Italy or France as it is from former or current
adversaries."[^58^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor058)

In sum, the academic and historical evidence indicates that although the
United States can use arms sales to enhance the military capabilities of
other nations and thereby shift the local and regional balance of power,
its ability to dictate specific outcomes through such efforts is
severely limited.

[Arms for (Not That Much) Influence]{.underline}. [Successful foreign
policy involves encouraging other nations to behave in ways that benefit
the United States.]{.underline} As noted, [the United States has often
attempted to use arms sales to generate the sort of leverage or
influence necessary to do this. History reveals, however, that the
benefits of the arms for influence strategy are limited for two main
reasons.]{.underline}

[First, the range of cases in which arms sales can produce useful
leverage is much narrower than is often imagined]{.underline}. Most
obviously, [arms sales are unnecessary in situations where the other
country already agrees or complies with the American position or can be
encouraged to do so without such incentives.]{.underline} This category
includes most U.S. allies and close partners under many, though not all,
circumstances.

Just as clearly, [the arms for influence strategy is a nonstarter when
the other state will never agree to comply with American
demands]{.underline}. This category [includes a small group of obvious
cases such as Russia, China, Iran, and other potential
adversaries]{.underline} (to which the United States does not sell
weapons anyway), but it also includes a much larger group of cases in
which the other state opposes what the United States wants, or in which
complying with U.S. wishes would be politically too dangerous for that
state's
leadership.[^59^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor059)

In addition, [there are some cases in which the United States itself
would view arms sales as an inappropriate tool]{.underline}. The Leahy
Law, for example, bars the United States from providing security
assistance to any specific foreign military unit deemed responsible for
past human rights
abuses.[^60^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor060) More
broadly, [arms sales are clearly a risky choice when the recipient state
is a failed state or when it is engaged in a civil conflict or
interstate war.]{.underline} Indeed, in such cases it is often unclear
whether there is anyone to negotiate with in the first place, and
governments are at best on shaky ground. At present the United States
bars 17 such nations from purchasing American arms. As long as these
nations are embargoed, arms sales will remain an irrelevant option for
exerting
influence.[^61^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor061)

Apart from these cases, there is a large group of nations with tiny
defense budgets that simply don't buy enough major conventional weaponry
to provide much incentive for arms sales. On this list are as many as
112 countries that purchased less than \$100 million in arms from the
United States between 2002 and 2016, including Venezuela, Jamaica, and
Sudan. Lest this category be dismissed because it includes mostly
smaller and less strategically significant countries from the American
perspective, it should be noted that each of these countries has a vote
in the United Nations (and other international organizations) and that
many of them suffer from civil conflicts and terrorism, making them
potential targets of interest for American policymakers looking for
international influence.

By definition, then, [the arms-for-influence strategy is limited to
cases in which a currently noncompliant country might be willing to
change its policies]{.underline} (at least for the right price or to
avoid punishment).

[The second problem]{.underline} with the arms for influence strategy
[is that international pressure in general, whether in the form of
economic sanctions, arms sales and embargoes, or military and foreign
aid promises and threats, typically has a very limited impact on state
behavior]{.underline}. Though again, on paper, the logic of both
coercion and buying compliance looks straightforward, research shows
that leaders make decisions on the basis of factors other than just the
national balance sheet. In particular, [leaders tend to respond far more
to concerns about national security and their own regime security than
they do to external pressure. Arms sales]{.underline}, whether used as
carrots or sticks, [are in effect a fairly weak version of economic
sanctions]{.underline}, which research has shown have limited effects,
even when approved by the United Nations, and tend to spawn a host of
unintended consequences. As such, the expectations for their utility
should be even more
limited.[^62^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor062) A
recent study regarding the impact of economic sanctions came to a
similar conclusion, noting that, "The economic impact of sanctions may
be pronounced ... but other factors in the situational context almost
always overshadow the impact of sanctions in determining the political
outcome."[^63^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor063) The
authors of another study evaluating the impact of military aid concur,
arguing that, "[In general we find that military aid does not lead to
more cooperative behavior on the part of the recipient state. With
limited exceptions, increasing levels of U.S. aid are linked to a
significant reduction in cooperative foreign policy
behavior]{.underline}."[^64^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor064)

Perhaps the most explicit evidence of the difficulty the United States
has had exerting this kind of leverage came during the Reagan
administration. Sen. Robert Kasten Jr. (R-WI) signaled the concern of
many when he said, "Many countries to whom we dispense aid continue to
thumb their noses at us" at the United Nations, and Congress passed
legislation authorizing the president to limit aid to any state that
repeatedly voted in opposition to the United States at the
UN.[^65^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor065) In
1986, the Reagan administration began to monitor voting patterns and
issue threats, and, in roughly 20 cases in 1987 and 1988, it lowered the
amount of aid sent to nations the administration felt were not
deferential enough. An analysis of the results, however, found no
linkage between changes in American support and UN voting patterns by
recipient states. The authors' conclusion fits neatly within the broader
literature about the limited impact of sanctions: "The resilience of aid
recipients clearly demonstrates that their policies were driven more
powerfully by interests other than the economic threat of a
hegemon."[^66^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor066)

[The U.S. track record of generating influence through arms sales
specifically is quite mixed]{.underline}. [U.S. arms sales may have
improved Israeli security over the years]{.underline}, for example[, but
American attempts to pressure Israel into negotiating a durable peace
settlement with the Palestinians have had little impact. Nor have arms
sales provided the United States with enough leverage over the years to
prevent client states such as Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Indonesia, and Morocco
from invading their neighbors.]{.underline} [Nor have arms sales helped
restrain the human rights abuses of clients like Chile or Libya, or
various Middle Eastern client states. Although the United States has
used the promise of arms sales or the threat of denying arms
successfully from time to time, the failures outnumber the
victories]{.underline}. The most rigorous study conducted to tease out
the conditions under which arms for influence efforts are successful is
a 1994 study by John
Sislin.[^67^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor067) Collating
191 attempts between 1950 and 1992, Sislin codes 80 of those attempts
(42 percent) successful. Sislin's analysis is incomplete, however, since
he looks only at the immediate benefits of arms sales and does not
consider the long-term consequences.

Furthermore, a close look at the supposedly successful attempts reveals
that many of them are cases in which the United States is in fact simply
buying something rather than actually "influencing" another nation.
Thirty of the cases Sislin coded as successful were instances of the
United States using arms to buy access to military bases (20 cases) or
to raw materials (5 cases) or to encourage countries to buy more
American weapons (5
cases).[^68^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor068) Without
those in the dataset, the U.S. success rate drops to 31 percent.

Finally, [the conditions for successful leverage seeking appear to be
deteriorating]{.underline}. First, Sislin's study found that American
influence was at its height during the Cold War when American power
overshadowed the rest of the world. [With the leveling out of the global
distribution of power, both economic and military, the ability of the
United States to exert influence has waned]{.underline}, regardless of
the specific tool being used. Second, as noted above, [the U.S. share of
the global arms market has declined as the industry has become more
competitive and, as a result, American promises and threats carry less
weight than before.]{.underline} As William Hartung noted, "The odds
\[of\] buying political loyalty via arms transfers are incalculably
higher \[worse\] in a world in which there are dozens of nations to turn
to in shopping for major combat
equipment."[^69^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor069)

[So far we have argued that arms sales lack a compelling strategic
justification, amplify risks, and generate a host of unintended negative
consequences. These factors alone argue for significantly curtailing the
arms trade]{.underline}. But the case for doing so is made even stronger
by the fact that greatly reducing arms sales would also produce two
significant benefits for the United States that cannot otherwise be
enjoyed.

[The first benefit from reducing arms sales would be greater diplomatic
flexibility and leverage]{.underline}. Critics might argue that even if
arms sales are an imperfect tool, forgoing arms sales will eliminate a
potential source of leverage. We argue that, on the contrary, **[the
diplomatic gains from forgoing arms sales will outweigh the potential
leverage or other benefits from arms sales]{.underline}**. Most
importantly, by refraining from arming nations engaged in conflict, [the
United States will have the diplomatic flexibility to engage with all
parties as an honest broker]{.underline}. The inherent difficulty of
negotiating while arming one side is obvious today with respect to North
and South Korea. After decades of U.S. support for South Korea, North
Korea clearly does not trust the United States. Similarly, U.S. attempts
to help negotiate a peace deal between the Israelis and Palestinians
have long been complicated by American support for Israel. [To stop
arming one side of a contentious relationship is not to suggest that the
United States does not have a preferred outcome in such cases. Rather,
by staying out of the military domain the United States can more readily
encourage dialogue and diplomacy.]{.underline}

[Forgoing arms sales is likely to be a superior strategy even in cases
where the United States has an entrenched interest]{.underline}. In the
case of Taiwan, for example, though [it is clear that Taiwan needs to
purchase weapons from other countries to provide for its defense, those
weapons do not have to be made in the United States]{.underline}.
[Having Taiwan buy from other suppliers would help defuse U.S.-China
tensions.]{.underline} Even if Taiwan's defenses remained robust, China
would clearly prefer a situation in which American arms no longer signal
an implicit promise to fight on Taiwan's behalf. This could also promote
more productive U.S.-China diplomacy in general, as well as greater
stability in the Pacific region. Most important, [breaking off arms
sales would also reduce the likelihood of the United States becoming
entangled in a future conflict between Taiwan and China.]{.underline}

T[he second major benefit of reducing arms sales is that it would imbue
the United States with greater moral authority.]{.underline} Today, as
[the leading arms-dealing nation in the world, the United States lacks
credibility in discussions of arms control and
nonproliferation]{.underline}, especially in light of its military
interventionism since 2001. By showing the world that it is ready to
choose diplomacy over the arms trade, the United States would provide a
huge boost to international efforts to curtail proliferation and its
negative consequences. This is important because the United States has
pursued and will continue to pursue a wide range of arms control and
nonproliferation objectives. [The United States is a signatory of
treaties dealing with weapons of mass destruction, missile technology,
land mines, and cluster munitions, not to mention the flow of
conventional weapons of all kinds. The effectiveness of these treaties,
and the ability to create more effective and enduring arms control and
nonproliferation frameworks, however, depends on how the United States
behaves.]{.underline}

This is not to say that unilateral American action will put an end to
the problems of the global arms trade. States would still seek to ensure
their security and survival through deterrence and military strength.
Other weapons suppliers would, in the short run, certainly race to meet
the demand. But history shows that global nonproliferation treaties and
weapons bans typically require great-power support. In 1969, for
example, Richard Nixon decided to shutter the American
offensive-biological-weapons program and seek an international ban on
such weapons. By 1972 the Biological Weapons Convention passed and has
since been signed by 178
nations.[^98^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor098) In
1991 President George H. W. Bush unilaterally renounced the use of
chemical weapons. By 1993 the United States had signed the Chemical
Weapons Convention, which now has 192
signatories.[^99^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor099) Both
of these efforts succeeded in part because the United States took
decisive early action in the absence of any promises about how others
would
respond.[^100^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor100) Without
U.S. leadership, any effort to limit proliferation of major conventional
weapons and dangerous emerging technologies is likely to fail.

#### Leveraging fails---especially in interstate conflicts like human rights. 

[**Stohl et al 18** (Rachel Stohl,]{.underline} the director of the
Conventional Defense program at the nonpartisan Stimson Center; Shannon
Dick, research associate of the Conventional Defense program at the
nonpartisan Stimson Center, "Trump Doesn't Understand Arms Sales,"
<https://www.usnews.com/opinion/world-report/articles/2017-04-25/president-donald-trump-does-not-understand-arms-sales>)

President Donald J. Trump\'s approach toward arms sales is slowly coming
into focus. [The Trump administration\'s preliminary 2018 budget
proposal]{.underline} -- which includes a 28 percent cut in funding for
the Department of State and proposed changes to the foreign military
financing program -- [lends some clues to the direction of U.S. arms
sales]{.underline}. Based on these initial actions, one thing does
appear certain: [Trump does not understand arms sales.]{.underline}

[The Trump administration seems to think that U.S. arms sales can be
used to fundamentally change the behavior of particular
governments]{.underline}. Although it sounds good in practice, [arms for
influence does not have a notable record of success. One need only think
of U.S. arms transfers to countries such as Egypt, Uzbekistan or Saudi
Arabia,]{.underline} where U.S. weapons have been used in direct
contravention of U.S. policies, priorities and values.

Research on the ways in which arms sales can influence behavior
identifies four elements that suggest when arms sales are more likely to
influence foreign governments.

[First, the recipient must be dependent on arms imports]{.underline}.
[If a country does not have a domestic industry to fulfill its weapons
procurement needs, the level of dependency, and thus influence, may be
higher.]{.underline} In practice, this means the United States may have
an opportunity to influence countries from Latin America to Asia which
rely on imports to meet their acquisition needs.

[Second, the supplier must be either the sole or one of very few arms
providers to the country in question]{.underline}. (Influence is
inversely related to the number of current or potential suppliers.)
India, which purchases significant quantities of weapons from the United
States, for example, may not be as susceptible to U.S. influence because
it also buys considerable armaments from Russia and China.

[Third, gifts and grants allow for more influence than cash purchases,
because they underscore the dependency of the recipient
state]{.underline}. Many African countries benefit from generous U.S.
weapons programs that offer free or reduced costs weapons to modernize
and professionalize their militaries. In these cases, [the United States
tries to use arms as leverage for particular policies and practice,
swaying behavior to align with U.S. standards and
objectives.]{.underline}

[Fourth, arms sales are more likely to affect foreign policy instead of
domestic policy, and interstate conflicts rather than internal
conflicts]{.underline}. [Arms are more likely to influence how countries
engage with other governments, rather than how they treat their own
citizens.]{.underline} Thus, authoritarian rulers are less likely to be
influenced by arms sales in ways that lead them to change their behavior
towards dissidents or opponents within their own countries.

Indeed, [the leverage gained from weapon transfers is often overstated,
non-existent, or representative of a reverse influence where the
recipient actually exerts leverage over the supplier by placing their
own demands and conditions on the weapons provider.]{.underline}

Irrespective of the facts, Trump is not the first president to be
enamored with the idea of arms for influence. The Obama administration
readily turned to arms sales as a means to try and exert influence and
control over government action and conflict dynamics. Yet the Obama
administration did recognize that some human rights conditions warranted
a pause in arms sales, such as to Egypt and Bahrain. The Trump
administration has already pushed forward sales to Saudi Arabia,
Bahrain, and Nigeria due to their importance in the U.S.
counter-terrorism campaign, despite significant track records of
consistent abuses.

[With the lifting of these holds, the Trump administration has
effectively rewarded]{.underline} (or at the very least ignored) [dismal
human rights records of numerous recipient governments]{.underline}. In
larger terms, the White House\'s advancement of these sales sheds a
bright light on the Trump administration\'s approach to U.S. arms sales
globally -- that is, the prioritization of short-term strategic
objectives over long-term democratic governance and protection of human
rights. Such an approach effectively undermines U.S. doctrine and values
and fosters impunity. In the long-term, this approach can fundamentally
work against U.S. strategic interests.

[The Trump administration also seems not to understand the utility of
some U.S. arms transfer programs.]{.underline} Reportedly, [the Trump
administration is considering replacing foreign military financing
grants with loans]{.underline}, under the presumption that such a move
will save the United States money in the long run. However, such
thinking misconstrues the intent and indeed the effects of the financing
program, which enables foreign governments to receive U.S. weapons and
associated military training via grants from the U.S. government. [These
grants are largely used to purchase U.S. weapons through foreign
military sales -- or government-to-government arms
transfers]{.underline} -- though a limited number of countries may use
the funds to finance commercial arms sales with private industry as
well.

Converting grants to loans could actually harm U.S. industry. First,
having repayments would make U.S. arms sales more expensive and could
lead purchasers to buy in cheaper markets, such as those in Russia and
China. Why would buyers pay for systems they used to get for free, and
in fact pay more than if they were to seek military equipment from other
vendors? Second, the foreignm military financing program is intended to
support the industrial base by lowering the domestic cost for weapons in
the United States, which would only increase if exports decrease. Third,
if exports lesson, U.S. jobs would be negatively impacted, as production
lines would have to close.

The first 100 days do not indicate the Trump administration understands
how it can and should use arms sales as a tool of foreign policy to
promote broader U.S. interests. To place U.S. arms transfers on firmer
footing, the Trump administration should recognize the limitations of
using arms for influence -- and use diplomatic means to underscore the
importance of, and U.S. commitment to, minimizing civilian harm that
will likely arise from risky arms transfers.

[The RAND study also found that when the United States cuts military aid
to foreign security force]{.underline}, their military capabilities are
negatively affected. However, it indicated that [the blow to a state's

capability]{.underline}, [as donated equipment and weapons can remain

[For instance, some military aid to Nigeria was cut in 2014 on account
of Nigeria's abysmal human rights record and rampant corruption. Yet,

Partner Capacity Building Should Build Capacity Finally, [overemphasis
on weapons sales]{.underline} of [threatens to undermine America's most
important security initiatives. Since]{.underline} the
[9/11]{.underline} attacks, [the United States has continued to increase
its "partner capacity building" efforts to improve the ability of other
states, particularly less developed ones, to provide
security]{.underline} for themselves and to contribute to joint
operations. Newly arrived Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made this one of
his top three priorities with his first policy statement, and he has
since pushed the Pentagon towards "Threat-Based Security Cooperation."
[Asking embassies and even the military to play a role in selling
weapons is not new, but pursuing this single-mindedly would undermine
these]{.underline} Security Cooperation [Offices' central mission.
Improving foreign security forces is a complicated task that
includes]{.underline}, according to the Congressional Research Service,
"[training, mentoring, advising]{.underline}, equipping, exercising,
[educating and planning with foreign security forces, primarily in
fragile and weak states." Shifting focus from the countries facing the
most important mutual threats to ones most likely to buy lots of weapons
will worsen these effects. One of the key lessons of security
cooperation is that trying to build American-style militaries within
developing states is often a terrible idea. The United States does not
produce many weapons smaller states need. South Korea's quite
successful]{.underline} T-50 Golden Eagle [multi-role jet --- bought by
Iraq, Thailand, and the Philippines --- is a more appropriate
counterinsurgency weapon than anything currently in the U.S. arsenal. A
Brazilian]{.underline} Embraer Super [Tucano]{.underline} --- which an
American firm builds under license for transfer to Afghanistan, Lebanon,
and Nigeria --- [is better still. Any effort to increase U.S. arms sales
should acknowledge this limitation. Turning Security Cooperation
Officers in U.S. embassies and on regional combatant command staffs into
"salesmen" will undermine these professionals' status as valuable
advisors working towards mutual security interests. The result will be
less capable allies and, if this causes growing mistrust in American
intentions, long-term damage to America's ability to supply
weapons.]{.underline}

In true showmanship fashion, U.S. President Donald Trump is keeping the
world in suspense about whether he will soon double down on the United
States' [trade
war](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-03-22/better-way-challenge-china-trade) with
China or call a truce. The big reveal will come after his meeting with
Chinese President Xi Jinping on the margins of the G-20 in Buenos Aires
later this week. Trump has at times been
optimistic, [telling](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46242732) reporters,
"I think a deal will be made. We'll find out very soon." Don't believe
the hype. [**Any agreement** in Argentina **will be a tactical pause at
best**, providing short-term relief to jittery stock markets and
beleaguered U.S. farmers, **but having no material or long-lasting
effect on the slide toward a high-stakes geopolitical competition
between the United States and China**. The days when the world's two
largest economies could meet each other halfway have gone.]{.underline}
Over the course of his first five-year term, **[Xi passed up repeated
opportunities to avert rivalry with Washington.]{.underline}** [His
increasingly **revisionist and authoritarian turn** has instead
**eliminated the possibility of a grand bargain between the United
States and China**]{.underline}. On most issues of consequence, **[there
is simply no overlap between Xi's vision for China's rise and what the
United States considers an acceptable future for Asia and the world
beyond.]{.underline}** Whether Trump and Xi reach some short-term
accommodation in Buenos Aires is anyone's guess. There are substantial
divisions within the Trump administration and no policy process to
adjudicate them. As a result, the White House has neither an agreed-upon
bottom line nor a clear negotiating strategy. [Bilateral negotiations
have been flailing in fits and starts, leaving China guessing what might
ultimately satisfy Trump.]{.underline} The meeting in Buenos Aires may
well fail to curb the president's appetite for more tariffs on China.
Over the last year, **[the Trump administration has substantially
hardened its policies and rhetoric toward
Beijing]{.underline}**. Consider, for example, Vice President Mike
Pence's
blistering [speech](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-administrations-policy-toward-china/) at
the Hudson Institute in October, in which he accused China of a litany
of economic, political, and military misdeeds. Pence continued his
strident tone while substituting for Trump at Asia's annual regional
summits in mid-November. [The vice president
openly ]{.underline}[mocked](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apec-summit-usa/pence-vows-no-end-to-tariffs-until-china-bows-idUSKCN1NM04K)[ Xi's
signature foreign policy program, the Belt and Road Initiative,
declaring that the United States, by contrast, does not "offer
constricting belts or a one-way road.]{.underline}" In the meantime, the
Trump administration has [stepped
up](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/with-new-indictments-us-launches-aggressive-campaign-to-thwart-chinas-economic-attacks/2018/11/01/70dc5572-dd78-11e8-b732-3c72cbf131f2_story.html?utm_term=.ed6a456b7588) pressure
on Beijing with a series of indictments and financial penalties to blunt
China's illegal and unfair trade practices.  All that said, it is widely
known that Trump is of two minds on China. Even as the
president [reiterates](https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/2165733/donald-trump-insists-he-wont-meet-iranian-president) his
long-standing belief that China has "cheated" and "plundered" the United
States, no one should be surprised if he chooses to make a deal, declare
victory, and go home. By earning symbolic and politically salient
concessions, Trump could minimize short-term risks to U.S. markets while
claiming that he alone finally stood up to Beijing. The contours of such
a deal are well understood. Trump would agree to hit pause on any new or
higher tariffs. In exchange, China would pledge to purchase more U.S.
goods (including soy beans and liquefied natural gas), while issuing
promises to enhance Chinese market access for U.S. products, further
open its financial sector, better protect intellectual property, and
reduce joint venture and technology transfer requirements. [Any burst of
goodwill, however, will be short lived. **Xi and the ruling Chinese
Communist Party are incapable of addressing the United States'
fundamental concerns over China's industrial policies and state-led
economic model.**]{.underline} Because of this, any process to settle
these issues is bound to fail. Even if tariffs are put on hold, the
United States will continue to restructure the U.S.-Chinese economic
relationship through investment restrictions, export controls, and
sustained law enforcement actions against Chinese industrial and
cyber-espionage. At the same time, **[there are no serious prospects for
Washington and Beijing to resolve other important areas of dispute,
including the South China Sea, human rights, and the larger contest over
the norms, rules, and institutions that govern relations in
Asia.]{.underline}** Nothing Trump and Xi agree to in Argentina will
substantially alter this course. Historians will debate why Xi so
mishandled the U.S.-Chinese relationship, likely finding some
combination of ideology, certitude of a declining United States, and
domestic exigencies that had nothing to do with foreign policy.
Regardless, **[the record is now clear that Xi, whether intentionally or
not, decisively sidestepped what was China's best and last opportunity
to avert rivalry with Washington.]{.underline}** When Xi assumed China's
presidency in 2013, U.S. President Barack [Obama's administration was
willing to test the proposition that Xi was both a reformer and someone
the United States could work with. The leaders rolled up their sleeves
at Sunnylands in June 2013 to begin charting a future course for what
both sides referred to as the world's most important bilateral
relationship.]{.underline} With tensions simmering between the powers,
this was a potentially crucial turning point. At the Communist Party's
Third Plenum conclave later that year, Xi said all the right things
about taking China further down the path of reform, including letting
the market play a "[decisive
role](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-24910434)" in the
economy. In turn, [Obama welcomed China's rising power, viewed it as
natural and legitimate, and ultimately saw Beijing as a partner on
issues including climate change and nuclear nonproliferation. **Members
of Obama's cabinet said repeatedly that U.S.-Chinese cooperation was
necessary to address the globe's most pressing problems, with Obama
himself
making **]{.underline}**[clear](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/obama-china-weak-and-strong)[ that
he thought a strong China was preferable to a weak one.]{.underline}**
Obama did push back on China, for instance by underscoring U.S. alliance
commitments to Japan and the Philippines to deter China's assertiveness
in its maritime periphery. But he did so selectively and intermittently,
and never in ways that threatened to undermine China's core interests or
the bilateral relationship. Toward the end of the Obama administration,
the president directed his cabinet to begin strategic stability talks
with Beijing, believing that dialogue was still the principal means to
manage mounting competition. Yet, [at nearly every turn, Xi rejected
Obama's overtures in areas of significant dispute. Instead of seeking to
narrow differences, **Xi accelerated China's efforts to develop an
illiberal sphere of influence in ways that increasingly undermined vital
U.S. interests**.]{.underline} [While Washington negotiated in good
faith, **Beijing dragged its feet for years on a bilateral investment
treaty that would have addressed many issues at the root of today's
trade war**.]{.underline} At the same time, Xi reasserted state control
over China's economy, failing to deliver much-needed reforms that would
have created a more reciprocal economic relationship. [And after the
Chinese government pledged to cease and desist on cyber commercial
espionage in 2015, U.S. intelligence
officials ]{.underline}[determined](https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/415802-nsa-official-china-violating-agreement-on-cyber-economic-espionage)[ that
China was back to its old ways within a couple of years**. On security
issues, Xi was equally uncompromising.** In 2015, he
famously ]{.underline}[lied](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-pacific/xi-denies-china-turning-artificial-islands-into-military-bases-idUSKCN0RP1ZH20150925)[ in
the White House Rose Garden that China had "no intention to militarize"
the South China Sea. In reality, he was planning to build artificial
islands with military bases the size of Pearl Harbor.]{.underline}
Wielding a large
economic [stick](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/chinas-use-of-coercive-economic-measures),
Xi used boycotts and travel bans to punish U.S. allies, including South
Korea and the Philippines, for standing up for themselves and further
aligning with the United States. He exacted extraordinary pressure on
Taiwan, calling off a diplomatic truce and peeling off some of Taipei's
few remaining diplomatic partners. Internally, [his record on human
rights has been abysmal, exemplified by the estimated one million
Muslims sent to internment camps in western China**. By the 2016
presidential election, Xi had lost the United States. Regardless of
whether Trump or Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton had taken the
helm, Washington was readying to challenge China on multiple
fronts.**]{.underline} Even much of [the U.S. business community---long
considered the ballast of the U.S.-Chinese relationship---had had
enough, and was newly willing to see Washington take punitive actions
against Beijing.]{.underline} An emerging bipartisan consensus on
Capitol Hill only reinforced the likelihood that the United States would
confront China on trade, opioids, cybertheft, and human rights.

First, [recent developments in international politics might discourage
North Korea from honoring its commitment to
denuclearization]{.underline}. On the one hand, North Korea can leverage
the growing competition between the United States and China to achieve
its goal. With the United States now launching a trade offensive on
China, it is natural for China to take retaliatory measures. If the
trade dispute escalates, which is very likely, it may spill over to the
security field. If once again in the future North Korea refuses to take
further steps to denuclearize, and the United States tries to persuade
China to impose tougher sanctions on North Korea, it is likely that
China may decline the demand as retaliation on the United States for its
trade offensive. On the other hand, [the united front to exert pressure
on North Korea to denuclearize is unraveling,]{.underline} at least for
now. Just before the summit with Kim, [Trump openly admitted that
denuclearization needs a process, which implied that the United States
has accepted the North Korean position of phased and synchronized
denuclearization]{.underline}. China holds similar positions. In
addition, China is thinking about sanctions relief. It is reported that
bans on cross-border trade have been relaxed along the China-North Korea
border. Russia has already been advocating sanctions relief as well. And
with inter-Korea relations getting warm, [the Moon Jae-in administration
in South Korea is prioritizing peace over denuclearization.]{.underline}
Second, [nuclear weapons are too precious in Kim's eyes to be traded
away for any rewards achieved after denuclearization]{.underline}.
[Promised sanctions relief or economic prosperity is not very appealing
to Kim because it may lead to regime instability,]{.underline} as China
experienced in the late 1980s. Instead, [minimal opening up and
quasi-isolation will more likely keep the regime secure, holding
unfavorable foreign influence at bay.]{.underline} Simply put, [Kim
wants absolute security. If he did not pursue 100 percent security, he
would not have imposed extremely tight controls on the flow of people
and information into and out of the country as his father and
grandfather did. I]{.underline}f he could take risks, he would not have
secured his position by purging his potential adversaries and their
family members, and assassinating his half-brother even though the
latter constituted no political challenge to him. [If he did not pursue
absolute security, he would not have had hundreds of trains in north and
northeast China make way for his special train when he visited Beijing
in March.]{.underline} Following this logic, [it is hard to swallow that
Kim will opt to give away the security of possessing nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. **[Suppose the United States provides a security
assurance to North Korea and withdraws all its troops from South Korea
and even Japan]{.underline}** --- the **[U.S. military still poses
security threats to North Korea as its intercontinental ballistic
missiles can target North Korea]{.underline}** from Guam, Hawaii, or the
North American continent. Third, North Korea has the potential to follow
the Indian model. Some analysts say that, inherently different from
North Korea, India has demonstrated rationality and international
responsibility with regards to nonproliferation. To refute the above
argument, Kim can launch a charm offensive, as he did in Panmunjom and
Singapore, and persuade other countries to believe that North Korea has
the same traits as India. If India can get international acquiescence to
its nuclear program without punishment, then North Korea can do it too.
Fourth, [North Korea needs to overcome internal obstacles to
denuclearize. It has been written into the constitution that the DPRK is
a nuclear weapons state. It would be hard for Kim to explain to the
people why it is necessary for North Korea, as a nuclear power, to
dismantle nuclear facilities. The]{.underline} [vested interests related
to the nuclear and missile programs will be another obstacle to
denuclearization.]{.underline} Nuclear scientists and engineers will be
unemployed and the military will lose a great number of posts if all the
elements of the nuclear program are eliminated. Fifth, the [technical
nature of denuclearization offers North Korea chance to renege sometime
in the future. No doubt, it will take years to complete denuclearization
as it is extremely complex. Nuclear programs involve many elements,
including nuclear material, reactors, weapons, command and control
systems, testing facilities, delivery vehicles, personnel, and so
on.]{.underline} Moreover, [denuclearization requires such
time-consuming procedures as the capping of nuclear operations,
declaration of inventories, inspections of facilities, dismantlement and
verification.]{.underline} If Stanford scientist Siegfried Hecker's
roadmap for denuclearization, or an updated version of it, is adopted by
the Trump administration, it will take about 10 years to complete the
denuclearization process, which is full of uncertainties and risks. [If
a future U.S. president does not see North Korea as an imminent threat
to the United States and loosens pressure on it, North Korea could
manage to preserve minimal nuclear capability and become a nuclear
threshold country.]{.underline} If need be, [Pyongyang can resume
nuclear development in a short period of time with preserved
technologies and know-how.]{.underline} In another scenario, if Kim asks
for an astronomical amount of remuneration for implementing a certain
procedure of denuclearization and the United States dismisses the
demand, [North Korea will have a good excuse not to take further
steps]{.underline}.

#### North Korea won't denuclearize -- they're expanding the nuclear program despite ongoing negotiations

SEOUL, July 12 (UPI) \-- **[North Korea will maintain its nuclear
arsenal for the next two decades and the United States\' insistence on
its rapid disarmament is an \"unrealistic goal]{.underline}**,\"
according to a report by the Federation of American Scientists presented
in Seoul on Friday. \"[There is no mix of economic, diplomatic or
military pressure that can verifiably eliminate North Korea\'s arsenal
on acceptable terms in the next few years,\"]{.underline} read the
report, which was produced by a study group on North Korean policy at
the Washington, D.C.-based think tank. \"[North Korea will in all
likelihood remain nuclear-armed and under the control of the Kim family
for the next two decades.\"]{.underline} The report claims that [a
single-minded focus on disarmament has overlooked other threats from
North Korea, including \"the risk of conventional war, ballistic missile
proliferation, contagion of infectious disease and the continued
suffering and repression of the North Korean people]{.underline}.\" The
authors call for a new, long-term strategy in dealing with a
nuclear-armed North Korea that looks to manage risks and maintain
stability while working toward economic, humanitarian and diplomatic
engagement. [Nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have
been at an impasse since a February summit]{.underline} in Hanoi,
Vietnam, between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim
Jong Un failed to produce an agreement. [North Korea has been seeking
concessions such as sanctions relief in exchange for steps it takes
toward dismantling its nuclear capabilities, while the United States has
continued to hold onto a \"maximum pressure\" strategy that calls for
complete denuclearization first. That hard-line approach hasn\'t yielded
any results]{.underline}, according to one of the report\'s authors,
Adam Mount, senior fellow at FAS. \"**[The focus on
disarmament]{.underline}** that the Trump administration has pursued,
**[this all-or-nothing approach, has unfortunately left us with nothing
so far]{.underline}**,\" Mount said at a news conference in Seoul on
Friday. \"[The imperative is to put in place an agreement
that]{.underline}, even if it doesn\'t get us to disarmament in the very
near future, at least [provides tangible security benefits that can be
built on subsequently,\"]{.underline} he said. Despite diplomatic
engagement that has now included three meetings between Trump and Kim,
[North Korea has continued to operate its uranium enrichment facility,
increase its nuclear stockpile and conduct ballistic missile
tests.]{.underline}

<https://www.npr.org/2018/11/19/668625273/north-korea-denuclearization-plan-has-gone-nowhere-since-trump-kim-summit>

After meeting with North Korea\'s leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore this
past June, President Trump was effusive. \"Our conversation was open,
honest, direct and very, very productive,\" he said. \"We produced
something that is beautiful.\" [But after five months of canceled
meetings and muted statements of dissatisfaction by both countries,
experts say there is no sign of progress toward the Singapore goal of
so-called \"denuclearization\" of the North.]{.underline} \"I think
right now, we are absolutely stuck,\" says [Sue Mi
Terry](https://www.csis.org/people/sue-mi-terry), a senior fellow at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies. Terry and others trace
the source of the problem to the \"beautiful\" document signed in June
by Trump and Kim. Known as [the [Singapore
Declaration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/joint-statement-president-donald-j-trump-united-states-america-chairman-kim-jong-un-democratic-peoples-republic-korea-singapore-summit/)]{.underline},
it laid out, in the broadest terms, how the U.S. and North Korea could
learn to get along. In just over 400 words, it [says that the U.S. will
normalize relations with North Korea in exchange for \"denuclearization
of the Korean Peninsula.\" But it does not specify a process or even an
order in which these goals would occur.]{.underline} Since the summit,
[North Korea has said normalization must start before denuclearization,
while the U.S. maintains that the North must hand over its nuclear
weapons before any normalization can begin. \"We are asking North Korea
to move first, and North Korea is asking the United States to take the
next step,\"]{.underline} Terry says. As a result, the situation looks
very similar to how it did in June. Last week, Terry\'s colleagues
[published satellite
photos](https://www.npr.org/2018/11/12/667028095/commercial-satellites-reveal-north-korean-missile-base)
showing an operating North Korean missile base near the South Korean
border. The U.S. wants North Korea to declare such bases, but the North
has so far refused to do so. Meanwhile, [Kim has urged the U.S. to drop
sanctions ahead of denuclearization activities, but the U.S. refuses to
budge.]{.underline} \"[We\'re at an impasse where we\'re not going to
give North Korea what they want, and the North Koreans are not giving us
what we want,\" says [Jung
Pak](https://www.brookings.edu/experts/jung-h-pak/), a senior fellow at
the Brookings Institut]{.underline}ion. Each week that passes without
progress \"really lays bare the anemic nature\" of the Singapore
Declaration, she says. \"[We\'re at a point where we have]{.underline},
in my opinion, almost [an historic opportunity]{.underline} for a
breakthrough in North Korea [and we\'re sitting around twiddling our
thumbs,\" says [Sig
Hecker](https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/people/siegfried_s_hecker), a
physicist at Stanford University]{.underline} who has made several trips
to some of North Korea\'s most sensitive nuclear facilities. He says the
opportunity exists because Kim wants economic development, and Trump
wants a big foreign policy win. [Hecker believes that the
administration\'s all-or-nothing approach to dismantling the North\'s
nuclear weapons infrastructure is unrealistic and the Singapore summit
must be followed by \"dogged diplomacy.\"]{.underline} Full
denuclearization might take a decade or so. \"It\'s going to take a lot
of trust-building and a lot of individual actions on each side to get
there,\" he says. \"I think what we need to do is try to get things on
paper in greater detail,\" says [Bruce
Klingner](https://www.heritage.org/staff/bruce-klingner), a senior
research fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation. [What\'s
needed to follow the Singapore Declaration]{.underline}, he says, [is a
document more like the old arms control agreements between the U.S. and
the Soviet Union. Those treaties went on for tens of pages and laid out
clear rules for the Cold War adversaries.]{.underline} \"[We didn\'t
like \[the Soviets\], we didn\'t trust them, but by having very
extensive carefully delineated text, we could move forward on capping
and thinning down weapons programs]{.underline},\" he says. The Trump
administration is not a fan of such complex agreements. It recently
scrapped the nuclear deal with Iran, and is planning to withdraw from
another nuclear treaty with Russia. For its part, [Pyongyang also seems
unwilling to engage on the details]{.underline}. It has eschewed
lower-level diplomatic meetings that are necessary to draft a more
complex agreement, pushing instead for a second Trump-Kim summit.

### Denuclearization Focus Bad

#### Focusing on North Korea's nuclear disarmament prevents tangible solutions to other security concerns -- North Korea says no and the CP ensures further aggression

n.d., <https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/media/FAS-DPRK-SG.pdf>,
Accessed 7/13/19 DDI-GN)

[The unrealistic goal of rapidly dismantling the North Korean nuclear
arsenal has consumed the military, economic, and diplomatic policies of
the United States and its allies]{.underline}. However, [an exclusive
pursuit of disarmament will come at the cost efforts to manage other
critical interests]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} the risks of
[conventional war, ballistic missile proliferation, contagion of
infectious disease, and the continued suffering and repression of the
North Korean people.]{.underline} [The tendency to ignore interests
other than disarmament is especially costly at a time when Pyongyang
stands at a critical military, economic, and social juncture that will
determine whether its nuclear arsenal expands indefinitely and is used
to coerce and intimidate its neighbors;]{.underline} whether markets and
consumer technologies become permanent instruments of state repression,
poverty, social stratification, and sexism within North Korea; whether
the regime's cyber, financial, and other criminal activity becomes a
permanent threat to the international system or can be contained at
manageable levels. [If security, economic, and humanitarian trends
continue unchanged, Pyongyang will expand its abilities to aggress
against the United States and its allies and to fund its activities
through economic development at home and illicit activity
abroad]{.underline} over the next two decades. **[The pursuit of
immediate disarmament has not only distracted from a range of pressing
challenges; it has also exacerbated them.]{.underline}** [Allied
deterrence and diplomatic policy has generated incentives for Pyongyang
to expand, diversify, and conceal its nuclear arsenal.]{.underline} In
its current form, the international sanctions regime has unnecessarily
contributed to the suffering of the North Korean people from privation
and infectious disease, and may have helped to enhance the regime's
overseas illicit networks.5 Attempts to isolate the regime have aided
its attempts to isolate the North Korean people from the international
community. The challenge of negotiations and a series of missteps have
caused strains between Washington, Seoul, and Tokyo. [There is no mix of
economic, diplomatic, or military pressure that can verifiably eliminate
North Korea's arsenal on acceptable terms in the next few
years]{.underline}.6 [The United States and its allies can no longer
rely on the assumption that North Korea will rapidly eliminate its
nuclear arsenal.]{.underline}

### No Reunification

#### Reunification is unfeasible -- too large of an economic gap between the North and South

**Fendos,** professor at Dongseo University in South Korea, **2018**

(Justin, "Korean Reunification Is Already Unviable," The Diplomat,
August 24,
<https://thediplomat.com/2018/08/korean-reunification-is-already-unviable/>,
Accessed 7/13/19 DDI-GN)

[As South Korean President Moon Jae-in continues his push to declare an
official end to hostilities with North Korea, many are wondering: What
will happen to Korean prospects for reunification?]{.underline} Some
have already identified the fact that [an official peace might make
reunification more difficult]{.underline} since North Korea's standing
as an independent country would be legitimized. In many ways, [Moon's
efforts appear to be a deliberate attempt to achieve this
outcome]{.underline}. Before overreacting and labeling Moon a naïve
North Korean sympathizer, let us consider the reasons why [South Korea
might want to enhance the standing of its northern enemy.]{.underline}
Remember, [South Korea is a nation with mandatory conscription to defend
against the North]{.underline}. [North Korea, on the other hand, is a
country whose official stance has been to view the South as a puppet of
the United States, in need of liberation from capitalist
tyranny.]{.underline} They are not exactly best buddies at the bar.
Nevertheless, [there are some good reasons why Seoul might want to let
Pyongyang adopt the status of an independent country, unfettered by
wartime sanctions.]{.underline} The first and most important reason has
to do with the simple fact that [Korean reunification is already
unviable]{.underline}. [Even if Kim Jong Un decided to retire today,
defect to the South, and hand over his entire country wholesale and
peacefully, the process of reunification would be impossible to
undertake]{.underline}. [The technological and economic differences
between the two countries are simply too great. Reunification would
result in a deluge of new residents to the South]{.underline},
[accompanied by an overwhelming financial burden to provide healthcare,
employment, education, social services, and infrastructure. The costs
would simply be prohibitive.]{.underline}

SEOUL (Reuters) - [South Korea's nominee for unification minister
said]{.underline} on Tuesday that [North Korea cannot expect
to]{.underline} achieve a prosperous economy and [keep its weapons
programs]{.underline}, as nuclear talks have stalled since the collapse
of a U.S.-North Korea summit last month. [The summit between U.S.
President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Hanoi fell
apart over conflicting demands by the North for sanctions relief and
from the United States for Pyongyang to give up its nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} Since then, relations between the two Koreas have
been left in limbo. South Korean President Moon Jae-in recently tapped
pro-engagement scholar Kim Yeon-chul as new unification minister in
charge of inter-Korean affairs. "I will seek a creative solution so that
North Korea and the U.S. can meet again soon and find common ground,"
Kim told a confirmation hearing, without elaborating. Kim, 55, advised
Moon's office on Korean summits before moving to head the state-run
Korea Institute for National Unification. If he passes the hearing, he
is expected to expedite Moon's initiative for a "peace-driven economy."
[Kim said North Korea has taken some action toward denuclearization but
it was "insufficient", and the increased priority that North Korea is
giving to its economic development should be used as leverage to
encourage more progress on dismantling its weapons
programs.]{.underline} "Basically I think they can't have both nuclear
weapons and the economy at the same time," Kim said. A professor who
headed a think tank affiliated with the Unification Ministry under Moon,
Kim is a staunch advocate for a restart of inter-Korean [economic
cooperation]{.underline}, but progress [has been hampered by
international sanctions over the North's nuclear and missile
programs.]{.underline}

DGP**)**]{.underline}

Foreign ministers from 10 Southeast Asian countries are on the brink of
signing a code of conduct framework with the Beijing government to
prevent accidents in the widely contested South China Sea. They expect
China, the most powerful claimant to that 3.5 million-square-kilometer
expanse of water, to sign despite six years of resistance. Since a world
arbitration court tribunal ruled last year that China lacks a legal
foundation for its claim to some 95% of the sea, it has played extra
nice with Southeast Asia. Four Southeast Asian countries say they have
rights to some of the waters Beijing calls its own. But China can
eventually get out of the code. The whole idea began in 2002 when
Beijing and the Southeast Asian bloc signed a Declaration on the Conduct
of Parties in the South China Sea. A full code would still spell out how
claimant governments can avoid mishaps as their navy ships, coast
guards, fishing boats and even aircrafts operate in the same contested
sea stretching from Taiwan southwest to Singapore. At the same time, no
party would sell down its maritime sovereignty claim.

But did you notice the word "framework"? That means the thing due for
agreement now, after a draft got everyone's nod in May, is just a
prelude to the real thing. A real code won't be approved at ministerial
meetings this week or any other time on the horizon. [China could
effectively withdraw when the group of Southeast Asian countries known
as ASEAN gets down to the details of an actual code. Here
how.]{.underline}

First, [China normally doesn't like haggling with groups of other
countries, preferring bilateral talks instead, to avoid selling down its
outsized bargaining position as a big country. It sees the formulation
of a code as consultation, not a more formal diplomatic
negotiation]{.underline}. It's keener on one-on-one deals to keep the
other parties quiet after that arbitration ruling, often in exchange for
aid or investment.

[Then, after ASEAN and China get into the inevitably lengthy
consultations on the actual code, **officials in Beijing will probably
require that only certain parts of the sea be included**.]{.underline}
It's OK with including waters near the Spratly Island chain and
Scarborough Shoal, says Carl Thayer, Southeast Asia-specialized emeritus
professor at The University of New South Wales in Australia. [China
controls the shoal, sometimes sharing it with the nearby Philippines per
some analysts, and some of the Spratlys. It won't want to include the
Paracel Islands, which China alone controls despite a vehement
counter-claim from Vietnam]{.underline}, Thayer says.

ASEAN members [Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines believe
waters off their South China Sea coasts belong under their own
flags]{.underline}, good for fishing boats and fossil fuel expeditions.
[Chinese claims overlap all of them]{.underline}. And they're **[weaker
than China militarily, so they want a code of conduct to be legally
binding]{.underline}**, with support from their respective legislatures.
**[China says no to that idea]{.underline}**. "How ASEAN and China
should deal with violations of the code of conduct is an open question
at the moment," Thayer says in an Aug. 1 research note.

**[China]{.underline}** may also **[find ways to make the eventual code
unenforceable]{.underline}**, meaning not much would happen if one
claimant's coast guard boat slammed into another. China could still come
out and say the waters were rightfully its own, so how could someone
else be there? **[The proposed code "lacks clear-cut enforcement
mechanisms]{.underline}**," geopolitical intelligence platform Stratfor
says in a May 2 commentary, meaning no way to monitor other claimants or
enforce whatever's in the code itself. Southeast Asian countries hope
for something with more force. "**[Even if China and ASEAN ratified a
binding agreement, it would likely not be designed as a dispute
settlement mechanism]{.underline}**," Stratfor says. The reason, it
adds: "**[Beijing has made clear that it will resolve conflicts only on
a bilateral basis through its preferred mechanisms]{.underline}**."

Finally, **[the code doesn't stop China from angering the militarily
weaker Southeast Asian countries by surging ahead with its reclamation
of land for artificial islands]{.underline}**, adding to an estimated
3,200 acres in place now, **[and construction of facilities for military
hardware such as combat aircraft and radar systems.]{.underline}** It
could keep peace with Southeast Asia in the face of any code violations
or maritime expansion by citing a threat from the United States, which
periodically sends naval vessels to show it believes the South China Sea
is open to all, says Collin Koh, maritime security research fellow at
Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. "[The code of conduct
will not succeed if other potential players are not in the
process]{.underline}," he says.

[China\'s potential out-clauses won't stop the framework from being
signed in Manila]{.underline}; ASEAN has drawn 1,700 visitors to its
meetings Aug. 2-8. The point, for now: ASEAN looks like it's standing up
to China, while China tosses some goodwill into Southeast Asia to defuse
any backlash after the world court arbitration ruling.

### US interference bad

#### US interference with the code of conduct heightens tensions

**[Reuters 17]{.underline}**

conduct ready,\" ABS-CBN News,
https://news.abs-cbn.com/overseas/03/08/17/china-says-first-draft-of-s-china-sea-code-of-conduct-ready

Since 2010, [China and the 10 members of the Association of South East
Asian Nations (ASEAN) have been discussing a set of rules aimed at
avoiding conflict among rival claimants in the busy South China
Sea]{.underline}. Speaking at his annual news conference on the
sidelines of China\'s parliamentary session, Wang said talks last month
had made \"clear progress\" and had formulated a first draft of a
framework for the code. \"China and ASEAN countries feel satisfied with
this,\" he said. [Wang said tensions in the South China Sea had not just
\"somewhat dropped, but had distinctly dropped\" over the past
year]{.underline}. [But in a nod to the United States and its regular
freedom of navigation naval patrols in the region, Wang said those who
still wanted to \"stir up trouble\" will be condemned by countries in
the region. \"We definitely will not allow this stable situation, which
has been hard to come by, be damaged or interfered with,\" he said. The
United States has criticized China\'s construction of man-made islands
and its build-up of military facilities in the sea, and expressed
concern they could be used to restrict free movement]{.underline}.
[China has long called for]{.underline} what it terms \"countries
outside the region\" - generally a reference to [the United
States]{.underline} - [to stay out of the dispute]{.underline}, saying
China and Southeast Asia are determined to resolve things peacefully.

https://thediplomat.com/2014/02/why-china-isnt-interested-in-a-south-china-sea-code-of-conduct/

Finally, in the declaration [ASEAN and China agreed that adopting an
official "code of conduct" would "further promote peace and stability."
Yet since 2002, there's been little progress made]{.underline} towards
actually taking that next step. In fact, [disagreements
over]{.underline} how to handle proposals for [a code of conduct helped
derail the 2012 ASEAN ministerial meeting]{.underline} held in Cambodia.
The U.S. had reportedly pushed hard for progress on a code of conduct,
with backing from Vietnam and the Philippines. Other ASEAN states,
notably host nation Cambodia, refused to back the proposal. The meeting
dissolved without even the customary diplomatic communiqué. [Many look
to Indonesia, seen as ASEAN's honorary leader, to bridge the gap between
the various member states.]{.underline} Indonesia has in fact been
taking its role as mediator quite seriously. In the aftermath of the
failed 2012 ASEAN ministerial meeting, Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty
Natalegawa visited the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, and
Singapore. His shuttle diplomacy resulted in the "Six-Point Principles"
being issued on July 20, snatching a diplomatic victory from the ashes
of the ASEAN meeting. [Indonesia is also responsible for a reported
draft version of a possible "code of conduct."]{.underline} [According
to Reuters, which has seen the draft, the preliminary text from
Indonesia would call for an end to military exercises in disputed waters
and reaffirm total freedom of navigation in the region. The draft also
reportedly set out rules to prevent accidents at sea]{.underline}.
[China has resisted coming into to negotiations]{.underline} with a
sample draft, [and]{.underline} from Indonesia's proposal [it's not hard
to see why. China's navy routinely conducts exercises in disputed
regions, and the Chinese Coast Guard also patrols the water as a way of
asserting Chinese control. If a code of conduct would outlaw such
activities, it's hard to imagine why China would sign on to
it.]{.underline} China, meanwhile, has its own requirements for a code
of conduct, as articulated last year by [Foreign Minister Wang
Yi]{.underline}. Wang insisted on "consensus through negotiations,"
saying that the negotiations should "keep the comfort of all parties in
mind." From the Chinese perspective, this means that countries with
friendly relations with Beijing should not be pressured to support a
hardline code of conduct. It's unlikely that Beijing is overly concerned
with Vietnam and the Philippines' "comfort" being infringed on by an
overly lax code of conduct. Wang also [called for an "elimination of
interference," saying that the reason ASEAN and China have made no
progress on a code of conduct is due to outside meddling. Wang is
referring to U.S. efforts to encourage a code of conduct -- China has
repeatedly denounced U.S. involvement in ASEAN meetings as
interference]{.underline} in what then-Minister of Defense Liang
Guanglie has called the "distinctively Asian" regional architecture.
"Only Asians should lead the process to resolve regional issues," argued
China Daily after the U.S. raised the South China Sea as an issue at the
2010 ASEAN summit. In other words, [China wants the U.S. excluded from
regional conversations, and will not move forward on a code of conduct
until the U.S. butts out.]{.underline}

For 70 years the United States has dominated Southeast Asia with both
hard and soft power --- the capability to use economic or cultural
influence to shape the preferences of others. Soft power underpins and
makes possible robust hard power relationships. But some analysts and
policymakers refuse to recognize that U.S. influence and its
relationships in Southeast Asia are much shallower and more ephemeral
than assumed. Indeed, [despite U.S. enticement and pressure, U.S. allies
Australia, Japan, and the Philippines have so far declined U.S. requests
to join its freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea
against China's claims. Indonesia has expressed disapproval over such
U.S. "power projection" in the area. U.S. relations with Thailand have
not been close since the military coup there in 2014 and Bangkok seems
to be leaning toward China. Malaysia-U.S. relations have been brittle
since the United States took a legal interest in Prime Minister Najib
Razak's international financial dealings. Even staunch U.S. strategic
partner Singapore seems to be seeking a more neutral position between
Washington and Beijing. A recent example]{.underline} of this decline of
U.S. soft power [was the reaction of the Philippines regarding the
January 17 USS Hopper freedom of navigation operation (FONOP) near
Scarborough Shoal]{.underline}. The Shoal is claimed by China, Taiwan,
and the Philippines. The U.S. Navy guided missile destroyer sailed
through the 12 nautical mile territorial sea around the disputed
feature. The Hopper's transit was in innocent passage, which is
generally considered legal (if somewhat provocative). China requires
permission for innocent passage by warships and objected. [For the
United States, this FONOP was a demonstration of international law. But
it got no support from its ally, the Philippines.]{.underline} Indeed,
to Washington's chagrin, [Philippine presidential spokesperson Harry
Roque told the Straits Times, "For us, that \[referring to China's
protest against the FONOP\] is really a problem of America because we
have come to a point that we now have an independent foreign policy...
The problem of America today is no longer the problem of the
Philippines]{.underline}."

In true showmanship fashion, U.S. President Donald Trump is keeping the
world in suspense about whether he will soon double down on the United
States' [trade
war](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-03-22/better-way-challenge-china-trade) with
China or call a truce. The big reveal will come after his meeting with
Chinese President Xi Jinping on the margins of the G-20 in Buenos Aires
later this week. Trump has at times been
optimistic, [telling](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46242732) reporters,
"I think a deal will be made. We'll find out very soon." Don't believe
the hype. [**Any agreement** in Argentina **will be a tactical pause at
best**, providing short-term relief to jittery stock markets and
beleaguered U.S. farmers, **but having no material or long-lasting
effect on the slide toward a high-stakes geopolitical competition
between the United States and China**. The days when the world's two
largest economies could meet each other halfway have gone.]{.underline}
Over the course of his first five-year term, **[Xi passed up repeated
opportunities to avert rivalry with Washington.]{.underline}** [His
increasingly **revisionist and authoritarian turn** has instead
**eliminated the possibility of a grand bargain between the United
States and China**]{.underline}. On most issues of consequence, **[there
is simply no overlap between Xi's vision for China's rise and what the
United States considers an acceptable future for Asia and the world
beyond.]{.underline}** Whether Trump and Xi reach some short-term
accommodation in Buenos Aires is anyone's guess. There are substantial
divisions within the Trump administration and no policy process to
adjudicate them. As a result, the White House has neither an agreed-upon
bottom line nor a clear negotiating strategy. [Bilateral negotiations
have been flailing in fits and starts, leaving China guessing what might
ultimately satisfy Trump.]{.underline} The meeting in Buenos Aires may
well fail to curb the president's appetite for more tariffs on China.
Over the last year, **[the Trump administration has substantially
hardened its policies and rhetoric toward
Beijing]{.underline}**. Consider, for example, Vice President Mike
Pence's
blistering [speech](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-administrations-policy-toward-china/) at
the Hudson Institute in October, in which he accused China of a litany
of economic, political, and military misdeeds. Pence continued his
strident tone while substituting for Trump at Asia's annual regional
summits in mid-November. [The vice president
openly [mocked](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apec-summit-usa/pence-vows-no-end-to-tariffs-until-china-bows-idUSKCN1NM04K) Xi's
signature foreign policy program, the Belt and Road Initiative,
declaring that the United States, by contrast, does not "offer
constricting belts or a one-way road.]{.underline}" In the meantime, the
Trump administration has [stepped
up](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/with-new-indictments-us-launches-aggressive-campaign-to-thwart-chinas-economic-attacks/2018/11/01/70dc5572-dd78-11e8-b732-3c72cbf131f2_story.html?utm_term=.ed6a456b7588) pressure
on Beijing with a series of indictments and financial penalties to blunt
China's illegal and unfair trade practices.  All that said, it is widely
known that Trump is of two minds on China. Even as the
president [reiterates](https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/2165733/donald-trump-insists-he-wont-meet-iranian-president) his
long-standing belief that China has "cheated" and "plundered" the United
States, no one should be surprised if he chooses to make a deal, declare
victory, and go home. By earning symbolic and politically salient
concessions, Trump could minimize short-term risks to U.S. markets while
claiming that he alone finally stood up to Beijing. The contours of such
a deal are well understood. Trump would agree to hit pause on any new or
higher tariffs. In exchange, China would pledge to purchase more U.S.
goods (including soy beans and liquefied natural gas), while issuing
promises to enhance Chinese market access for U.S. products, further
open its financial sector, better protect intellectual property, and
reduce joint venture and technology transfer requirements. [Any burst of
goodwill, however, will be short lived. **Xi and the ruling Chinese
Communist Party are incapable of addressing the United States'
fundamental concerns over China's industrial policies and state-led
economic model.**]{.underline} Because of this, any process to settle
these issues is bound to fail. Even if tariffs are put on hold, the
United States will continue to restructure the U.S.-Chinese economic
relationship through investment restrictions, export controls, and
sustained law enforcement actions against Chinese industrial and
cyber-espionage. At the same time, **[there are no serious prospects for
Washington and Beijing to resolve other important areas of dispute,
including the South China Sea, human rights, and the larger contest over
the norms, rules, and institutions that govern relations in
Asia.]{.underline}** Nothing Trump and Xi agree to in Argentina will
substantially alter this course. Historians will debate why Xi so
mishandled the U.S.-Chinese relationship, likely finding some
combination of ideology, certitude of a declining United States, and
domestic exigencies that had nothing to do with foreign policy.
Regardless, **[the record is now clear that Xi, whether intentionally or
not, decisively sidestepped what was China's best and last opportunity
to avert rivalry with Washington.]{.underline}** When Xi assumed China's
presidency in 2013, U.S. President Barack [Obama's administration was
willing to test the proposition that Xi was both a reformer and someone
the United States could work with. The leaders rolled up their sleeves
at Sunnylands in June 2013 to begin charting a future course for what
both sides referred to as the world's most important bilateral
relationship.]{.underline} With tensions simmering between the powers,
this was a potentially crucial turning point. At the Communist Party's
Third Plenum conclave later that year, Xi said all the right things
about taking China further down the path of reform, including letting
the market play a "[decisive
role](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-24910434)" in the
economy. In turn, [Obama welcomed China's rising power, viewed it as
natural and legitimate, and ultimately saw Beijing as a partner on
issues including climate change and nuclear nonproliferation. **Members
of Obama's cabinet said repeatedly that U.S.-Chinese cooperation was
necessary to address the globe's most pressing problems, with Obama
himself
making [clear](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/obama-china-weak-and-strong) that
he thought a strong China was preferable to a weak one.**]{.underline}
Obama did push back on China, for instance by underscoring U.S. alliance
commitments to Japan and the Philippines to deter China's assertiveness
in its maritime periphery. But he did so selectively and intermittently,
and never in ways that threatened to undermine China's core interests or
the bilateral relationship. Toward the end of the Obama administration,
the president directed his cabinet to begin strategic stability talks
with Beijing, believing that dialogue was still the principal means to
manage mounting competition. Yet, [at nearly every turn, Xi rejected
Obama's overtures in areas of significant dispute. Instead of seeking to
narrow differences, **Xi accelerated China's efforts to develop an
illiberal sphere of influence in ways that increasingly undermined vital
U.S. interests**.]{.underline} [While Washington negotiated in good
faith, **Beijing dragged its feet for years on a bilateral investment
treaty that would have addressed many issues at the root of today's
trade war**.]{.underline} At the same time, Xi reasserted state control
over China's economy, failing to deliver much-needed reforms that would
have created a more reciprocal economic relationship. [And after the
Chinese government pledged to cease and desist on cyber commercial
espionage in 2015, U.S. intelligence
officials [determined](https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/415802-nsa-official-china-violating-agreement-on-cyber-economic-espionage) that
China was back to its old ways within a couple of years**. On security
issues, Xi was equally uncompromising.** In 2015, he
famously [lied](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-pacific/xi-denies-china-turning-artificial-islands-into-military-bases-idUSKCN0RP1ZH20150925) in
the White House Rose Garden that China had "no intention to militarize"
the South China Sea. In reality, he was planning to build artificial
islands with military bases the size of Pearl Harbor.]{.underline}
Wielding a large
economic [stick](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/chinas-use-of-coercive-economic-measures),
Xi used boycotts and travel bans to punish U.S. allies, including South
Korea and the Philippines, for standing up for themselves and further
aligning with the United States. He exacted extraordinary pressure on
Taiwan, calling off a diplomatic truce and peeling off some of Taipei's
few remaining diplomatic partners. Internally, [his record on human
rights has been abysmal, exemplified by the estimated one million
Muslims sent to internment camps in western China**. By the 2016
presidential election, Xi had lost the United States. Regardless of
whether Trump or Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton had taken the
helm, Washington was readying to challenge China on multiple
fronts.**]{.underline} Even much of [the U.S. business community---long
considered the ballast of the U.S.-Chinese relationship---had had
enough, and was newly willing to see Washington take punitive actions
against Beijing.]{.underline} An emerging bipartisan consensus on
Capitol Hill only reinforced the likelihood that the United States would
confront China on trade, opioids, cybertheft, and human rights.

Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative,

Lowell-SB

The long and bumpy process of consultations on a code of conduct (COC)
between China and the members of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) has gained some momentum since the July 2016 South China
Sea arbitration award. China communicated its willingness to make some
progress by adopting a framework for the COC last year[.]{.underline}
Officials from China and ASEAN met for the 23rd meeting of the Joint
Working Group on the implementation of the 2002 Declaration on the
Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) in Vietnam in March and
for the 15th Senior Officials' Meeting on the Implementation of the DOC
in China in June. At both meetings they exchanged views on a potential
COC.

[These developments suggest that there is some progress, or at least
growing political will, to finalize a COC, including debates on whether
the agreement should be legally-binding and over including the interests
of non-claimant states that make use of the South China
Sea.]{.underline} But **[the COC process poses more challenges than hope
for resolving the disputes. The COC has become a "holy grail," highly
desired but unattainable. A major concern should be that this holy grail
could turn into a tool for China to legitimize its actions in the South
China Sea by engaging in the process while subverting its spirit. To
this end, the challenges to the COC process are likely to
be:]{.underline}**

It has been over 25 years since ASEAN's first official commitment, in
1992, to peacefully resolve the disputes in the South China Sea.
Patience has been a necessary virtue for the region to work on any
issues of contention, and it took another 10 years for the group to work
out the non-binding DOC with China in 2002. [For 16 years since then,
the parties have been in pursuit of a COC that would help resolve the
resource-draining and tension-generating disputes. But China has time on
its side. That time has allowed China to successfully build its
capabilities, especially by constructing artificial islands in the
Spratlys in recent years]{.underline}. **[The lengthy and unproductive
negotiations over the COC meanwhile have diverted regional attention
away from the severity of Beijing's disruptive actions around the South
China Sea.]{.underline}**

**[The long-stalled, unproductive negotiations have already had a
detrimental effect on regional multilateralism. The South China Sea
issue has exposed ASEAN's institutional weaknesses, especially how its
consensus-based decision-making leads to impasses. Just one member
disagreeing with the content of a joint statement can silence the
group's voice.]{.underline}** The most oft-cited example was Cambodia's
obstruction of the ASEAN joint communique in 2012 when it served as
organization's chair. Many have associated Phnom Penh's lack of regional
solidarity with its allegiance to and economic dependency on China.

Moreover, [the South China Sea has become a "fatigued" theme which many
ASEAN chairs have come to dread during regional meetings. Even this
year's chair Singapore, with its notoriously skilled diplomacy, prefers
to focus on other issues, like counter-terrorism, cyber security, and
smart cities, where it sees more room for cooperation, or at least less
obstruction from pro-Beijing members of the grouping.]{.underline}

**[The longer the COC negotiations take, the more advantageous China's
position will become as it extends ever greater control over the
resources of the South China Sea, for instance by sending its fishing
fleet throughout the South China Sea and preventing other claimants from
exploiting natural resources within their waters and seabed as it did
recently when Vietnam attempted new oil and gas drilling]{.underline}**.
Even more conciliatory approaches like that of the current Philippine
government seem unlikely to divert China from its strategy of gaining
sole control over the South China Sea. Under President Rodrigo Duterte,
Manila has opted for a strategy of embracing China. Not only did Duterte
disregard the 2016 arbitral tribunal ruling, effectively abandoning the
legal victory and dealing a blow to the international rules-based-order
--- but he has chosen to pursue talks on joint development of oil and
gas resources with China (though no agreement seems forthcoming).
Nonetheless, Beijing continues to build up military facilities,
including on the Philippine continental shelf at Mischief Reef, and
harass Filipino fishers and military planes and ships.

A successful COC would be a major victory for all involved. It would
ward off diplomatic criticism of Beijing by the international community
and show that China can act responsibly and in accordance with the
international rules-based order. But a vague or ineffective
agreement---which is a far more likely outcome---would serve only the
interests of Beijing. With such a diplomatic success in hand, China
could and likely would continue with its plans to unilaterally control
the waters and airspace of the South China Sea.

[If the COC process continues on its current trajectory, and China
succeeds in filling the document with vague articles that would have
little impact on its behavior, it would effectively be abusing the
rules-based order to its own benefit]{.underline}. Instead of protecting
against unilateral actions in the South China Sea, the rules-based order
in the form of the COC could assist and justify China's expansion and
ultimately its sole control of the South China Sea. Other regional
actors need to recognize these traps of concluding a counter-productive
COC, and resist the urge to reach an agreement just to be able to say
they made progress. Instead, they should insist on negotiating the terms
and conditions of a real COC, one that would establish effective
rules-based dispute management mechanisms, not one that would by-pass
them for the sake of an easy "win."

### CoC fails

#### Code of conduct fails -- it's not enforceable, and the version of the code that will be signed can't solve any of their impacts

Conduct in A Disputed Sea,\" Forbes,
https://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphjennings/2017/08/03/how-china-can-avoid-following-the-code-of-conduct-in-a-disputed-sea/#3374fcae4bda

Foreign ministers from [10 Southeast Asian countries are on the brink of
signing a code of conduct framework]{.underline} with the Beijing
government to prevent accidents in the widely contested South China Sea.
[They expect China, the most powerful claimant to that 3.5
million-square-kilometer expanse of water, to sign despite six years of
resistance]{.underline}. Since a world arbitration court tribunal ruled
last year that China lacks a legal foundation for its claim to some 95%
of the sea, it has played extra nice with Southeast Asia. Four Southeast
Asian countries say they have rights to some of the waters Beijing calls
its own. But [China can eventually get out of the code.]{.underline} The
whole idea began in 2002 when Beijing and the Southeast Asian bloc
signed a Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea.
[A full code would still spell out how claimant governments can avoid
mishaps as their navy ships, coast guards, fishing boats and even
aircrafts operate in the same contested sea stretching from Taiwan
southwest to Singapore.]{.underline} At the same time, no party would
sell down its maritime sovereignty claim. But did you notice [the word
"framework"]{.underline}? [That means the thing due for agreement now,
after a draft got everyone's nod in May, is just a prelude to the real
thing. A real code won't be approved at ministerial meetings this week
or any other time on the horizon]{.underline}. China could effectively
withdraw when the group of Southeast Asian countries known as ASEAN gets
down to the details of an actual code. Here how. [First, China normally
doesn't like haggling with groups of other countries, preferring
bilateral talks instead, to avoid selling down its outsized bargaining
position as a big country]{.underline}. [It sees the formulation of a
code as consultation, not a more formal diplomatic
negotiation.]{.underline} It's keener on one-on-one deals to keep the
other parties quiet after that arbitration ruling, often in exchange for
aid or investment. Then, after ASEAN and China get into the inevitably
lengthy consultations on the actual code, [officials in Beijing will
probably require that only certain parts of the sea be
included]{.underline}. It's OK with including waters near the Spratly
Island chain and Scarborough Shoal, says Carl Thayer, Southeast
Asia-specialized emeritus professor at The University of New South Wales
in Australia. China controls the shoal, sometimes sharing it with the
nearby Philippines per some analysts, and some of the Spratlys. It won't
want to include the Paracel Islands, which China alone controls despite
a vehement counter-claim from Vietnam, Thayer says. [ASEAN members
Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines believe waters off their
South China Sea coasts belong under their own flags, good for fishing
boats and fossil fuel expeditions. Chinese claims overlap all of them.
And they're weaker than China militarily, so they want a code of conduct
to be legally binding, with support from their respective
legislatures]{.underline}. China says no to that idea. "[How ASEAN and
China should deal with violations of the code of conduct is an open
question]{.underline} at the moment," Thayer says in an Aug. 1 research
note. [China may also find ways to make the eventual code unenforceable,
meaning not much would happen if one claimant's coast guard boat slammed
into another]{.underline}. China could still come out and say the waters
were rightfully its own, so how could someone else be there? The
proposed code "lacks clear-cut enforcement mechanisms," geopolitical
intelligence platform Stratfor says in a May 2 commentary, meaning no
way to monitor other claimants or enforce whatever's in the code itself.
Southeast Asian countries hope for something with more force. "[Even if
China and ASEAN ratified a binding agreement, it would likely not be
designed as a dispute settlement mechanism]{.underline}," Stratfor says.
The reason, it adds: "[Beijing has made clear that it will resolve
conflicts only on a bilateral basis]{.underline} through its preferred
mechanisms." [Finally, the code doesn't stop China from angering the
militarily weaker Southeast Asian countries by surging ahead with its
reclamation of land for artificial islands, adding to an estimated 3,200
acres in place now, and construction of facilities for military hardware
such as combat aircraft and radar systems]{.underline}. It could keep
peace with Southeast Asia in the face of any code violations or maritime
expansion by citing a threat from [the United States,]{.underline} which
[periodically sends naval vessels to show it believes the South China
Sea is open to all]{.underline}, says Collin Koh, maritime security
research fellow at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. "[The
code of conduct will not succeed if other potential players are not in
the process]{.underline}," he says.

reluctant to do, wary of their economic dependence on their giant
neighbor. ASEAN leaders are meeting in Manila for a summit this week.
Philippine President Rodrigo [Duterte said on Thursday it was pointless
discussing Beijing\'s contentious activities and no one dared to
pressure it anyway. Experts doubt China would tie itself to a set of
rules in a waterway central to its geostrategic ambitions and expect it
to drag the process out until ASEAN accepts a weaker code than it
wants]{.underline}. [Asked if China]{.underline} had made any assurances
it [would stick to whatever code was agreed, Minh said: \"We don\'t have
any guarantee, we just have to try our best.\"]{.underline} Minh said
the code needed to be more comprehensive than the 2002 DOC, which was
only a political declaration. \"It was good if all parties were

[A U.S. Defense Department official on Friday questioned **China's
motive in agreeing to form a code of conduct for the South China Sea**,
as he urged a Southeast Asian bloc of nations to continue pursuing a
legally binding code that would govern actions by claimants in the
disputed region]{.underline}. Randall Schriver, U.S. assistant secretary
of defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs, told a news conference in
Kuala Lumpur that [Washington would encourage the 10-member Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to aim for a code of conduct (COC)
that would be "consistent with existing international laws and
norms."]{.underline} ["We do have some suspicion about China's motive,"
Schriver told reporters prior to his meeting with Malaysian Deputy
Defense Minister Liew Chin Tong]{.underline} and other security
officials. "**[The way they behave suggests that they are not
participant in upholding international law consistently]{.underline}**,"
Schriver said, referring to Beijing. "So [we would have suspicion in
terms of what they seek in the code of conduct."]{.underline} Apart from
China and Taiwan, the Philippines and fellow ASEAN countries [**Brunei,
Malaysia and Vietnam have overlapping claims in the South China Sea**.
Claimant states other than China have been pushing for a legally binding
code, which would spell out steps that each nation could take to avoid
disputes that could spiral out of control.]{.underline} Some countries
want the code to be binding and subject to ratification by signatory
states. China agreed in August 2018 to a draft that would eventually
serve as its basis. Schriver said that despite Washington's suspicion
over Beijing's motive in participating in discussions, the United States
believes that COC could be a mechanism to enhance safety in the disputed
region. The United States was not involved in drafting the code, he
said. [Washington has frequently sent warships near some
Chinese-occupied features in the South China Sea, where an estimated \$5
trillion worth of global trade passes annually. Beijing has built
military installations atop seven man-made islands it occupies in the
oil-rich region]{.underline}. Schriver issued his comments two days
after Beijing displayed its first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, during
a naval review off the coast of northern port city of Qingdao. More than
30 Chinese boats, submarines, frigates and almost 40 warplanes took part
in the event, reports said. The review, which marked the Chinese navy's
70th anniversary, was part of a major public relations drive by its
military amid rising concerns over its activities in South China Sea,
according to the Associated Press. More than a dozen foreign countries
also sent warships in the display of firepower, including Thailand,
Australia, Japan and Russia, according to China's state-run news agency
Xinhua. The United States did not send a ship. In his speech after
Wednesday's naval parade, [China's navy chief Shen Jinlong took a dig at
Washington and its allies, saying freedom of navigation should not be
used to infringe upon the rights of other countries.]{.underline}
"Respect for the rules is the cornerstone of maritime good order,"

was continuing to advance talks with Southeast Asian states on the code
of conduct.

After two decades of talks, **[skepticism about the development of a
South China Sea Code of Conduct (COC) is well-deserved]{.underline}**,
but it is also important to acknowledge progress when it happens. The
agreement on a single draft negotiating text, revealed ahead of the
ASEAN--China Post Ministerial Meeting on August 2, 2018, is an important
step in the process that deserves recognition. [The COC will not resolve
the South China Sea disputes, nor was it ever meant to]{.underline}.
Instead the COC is intended to manage disputes to avoid conflict pending
their eventual resolution by direct negotiation or arbitration among the
claimants. But [**any system to effectively manage the South China Sea
disputes would require three things, none of which are achieved yet in
the draft text**. First, an effective COC would need to be
geographically defined. The claimants do not need to resolve their
disputes, but they do need to agree on where those disputes are if they
hope to effectively manage them. For instance, any agreement that did
not include the Paracel Islands and the waters around them would be
unacceptable
to [Hanoi](http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2018/08/04/vietnams-response-to-chinas-militarised-fishing-fleet/).
The same goes for the Philippines in the case of Scarborough Shoal. And
what of waters and undersea features in the claimed exclusive economic
zones of Indonesia and Malaysia? **These areas are all claimed by China
via the nine-dash line, and would continue to be sites of tension if
excluded**]{.underline}. According to Carl Thayer,
who [revealed](https://thediplomat.com/2018/08/a-closer-look-at-the-asean-china-single-draft-south-china-sea-code-of-conduct/) many
details of the draft text, Vietnam suggested that "the present Code of
Conduct shall apply to all disputed features and overlapping maritime
areas claimed under the 1982 UNCLOS \[United Nations Convention on the
Law of the Sea\] in the South China Sea." [But that is too vague to be
effective and is worded to exclude areas in which Beijing claims
historic rights not recognized by other parties
under [UNCLOS](http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2018/07/27/china-cant-just-pick-and-choose-from-the-law-of-the-sea/).
Indonesia suggested adding that "the Parties are committed to respect
the Exclusive Economic Zone and continental shelf of the coastal states
as provided for in the 1982 UNCLOS."]{.underline} But again, that would
seem to purposely exclude areas in which China claims and is sure to
assert historic rights. It might be a legally correct position to take,
but it is not an effective basis for a COC. **[The only way that any
code could work is if it clearly encompasses the areas under contention,
including all reefs, rocks, submerged banks, waters, and airspace in
which China seeks to assert its historic rights.]{.underline}**
Specifying this without using language that would be unacceptable to any
of the claimants would be difficult, but possible if all parties were
committed to reaching a deal. Second, an effective COC would need a
dispute settlement mechanism. Disagreements over interpretation and
application of the text are inevitable. This is clear from the history
of the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China
Sea, which was too vague and had no means to resolve disagreements. [As
a result, most parties violated the text while insisting that they were
still in compliance and pointing their fingers at others. To resolve
this problem, both Indonesia and Vietnam reportedly suggested that
parties to the COC be able to take disagreements to the High Council
under the ASEAN Treaty of Amity and Cooperation**. That body, which has
never been convened, would include representatives nominated by ASEAN
members to hear and mediate disputes.**]{.underline} Its rulings would
not be legally binding or necessarily enforceable, but they would have
considerable weight. A major problem with the High Council suggestion
would be that under the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, it can only be
constituted by ASEAN members. A more effective option might be to spell
out the procedures for convening a High Council-like body that would
draw arbiters from a pool nominated by all parties, including China.
Third, [any effective regime to manage the South China Sea disputes
would need detailed provisions on fisheries management and oil and gas
development. But the positions enumerated in the negotiating text so far
are contradictory and fall well short of outlining a detailed and
coordinated system to manage resources.]{.underline} For instance,
Jakarta suggests that states should coordinate on fighting illegal
fishing as a form of transnational crime, but Indonesia's definition of
illegal fishing includes activities that others, especially China,
consider legal. And **[China's suggestions on oil and gas cooperation
seem more geared towards excluding foreign companies than towards
equitably managing resources with fellow claimants.]{.underline}**
Unfortunately, [**there is a fundamental contradiction in the COC**. It
is the wrong vehicle to discuss details on resource management because
of its membership, but it cannot be an effective means to manage the
disputes without doing so.]{.underline} Most of the ASEAN states have no
stake in the contested fisheries or hydrocarbon resources and would be
uninterested in negotiating the specifics of overlapping entitlements
and resource rights. The solution to this problem could be a COC signed
by all 10 ASEAN members and China that establishes general rules of
behavior within a clear geographic area, sets up an effective dispute
settlement mechanism, and endorses the immediate start of follow-on
negotiations involving only the relevant claimants on [fisheries
management](https://amti.csis.org/coc-blueprint-fisheries-environment/) and [oil
and gas
cooperation](https://amti.csis.org/a-blueprint-for-cooperation-on-oil-and-gas-production-in-the-south-china-sea/).
Such a document would be a major step towards peacefully managing the
South China Sea disputes, and there are hints that at least some
sections of the negotiating text might be on the right track. But the
differences between parties remain considerable and final agreement on
an effective COC still seems some way off.

Seemingly acknowledging that several other nations also claim
sovereignty over islands, rocks, and low tide elevations in the SCS,
[China signed the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of the Parties in the
South China Sea]{.underline}. Pursuant to that declaration [China agreed
to]{.underline}: 1) [reaffirm its respect for and commitment to the
freedom of navigation in and overflight above the SCS]{.underline}, 2)
resolve territorial and jurisdictional disputes by peaceful means,
without resorting to the threat or use of force, through friendly
consultations and negotiations by sovereign states directly concerned,
[and]{.underline} 3) [to exercise self-restraint in the conduct of
activities that would complicate or escalate disputes and affect peace
and stability including, among others, refraining from the action of
inhabiting presently uninhabited islands, reefs, shoals, cays, and other
features. Since 2009 China has breached each one of these
provisions]{.underline}. In May 2009, the PRC informed the United
Nations that it had "indisputable sovereignty over the islands in the
South China Sea," a position that it has consistently held since 1948.
In July 2010, a Chinese Ministry of Defense spokesman asserted that
China possessed "sufficient historical and legal backing" for such a
claim and added that China would "in accordance with the demands of
international law, respect the freedom of the passage of ships or
aircraft from relevant countries." However, [in November 2013 China
surprised the world when it announced the establishment of an Air
Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) over the East China Sea (ECS) that
not only overlapped with the South Korean and Japanese ADIZs and the
disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands but also required all aircraft that
intended to enter the ADIZ to file a flight plan and adhere to the
directions of Chinese officials.]{.underline} In response, the U.S. flew
two B-52 bombers through the ADIZ to send a clear message that Chinese
ADIZ requirements violated customary international law and thus unduly
infringed on U.S. freedom of navigation. [Shortly
thereafter]{.underline}, in December 2013 and once again without notice,
[China began a massive land reclamation project in seven locations in
the SCS.]{.underline} Once discovered, a Chinese foreign ministry
spokeswoman stated in late 2014 that the construction was "mainly for
the purpose of improving the working and living conditions for people
stationed on the islands" and so that the PRC could "better fulfill its
international obligations and responsibilities in search and rescue."
However, by April 2015, [after satellite imagery showed an airstrip
being built on one of the artificial islands]{.underline},
[the]{.underline} same [spokeswoman acknowledged for the first time that
China's activities were also intended to serve "necessary military
requirements.]{.underline}" While the United States and some ASEAN
nations protested China's unilateral actions as unlawful and
destabilizing, it wasn't until May 2015 that U.S. Secretary of Defense
Ash Carter asked for options that included flying naval surveillance
aircraft and steaming naval vessels in the vicinity of these man-made
islands. On May 20, the world was able to view a CNN television crew
aboard a U.S. Navy P-8 aircraft, which flew a mission in international
airspace (outside 12 nautical miles) in the vicinity of China's man-made
islands. During the flight, a Chinese military official repeatedly
warned the P-8 that it was in a Chinese "military alert zone" and
demanded that the aircraft depart the area. Shortly thereafter,
Secretary Carter proclaimed that the U.S. "would fly, sail, and operate
wherever international law allows" and noted that "turning an underwater
rock into an airfield simply does not afford the rights of sovereignty
or permit restrictions on international air or maritime transit." In
response, on August 11, [Chinese Ambassador Zhao Jianhua brazenly
asserted that "freedom of navigation does not mean to allow other
countries to intrude into the airspace of the sea which is sovereign...
no freedom of navigation for warships and airplanes."]{.underline}

## AT: HR Pressure

### AT: Thailand 

#### Thai-US relations weak, while Thai-China relations on the rise.

**[Prasirtsuk 17]{.underline}** (Kitti Prasirtsuk IS. Chapter Title: An
Ally at the Crossroads: Thailand in the US Alliance System. Comparing US
Alliances in the 21st Century. Global Allies. MICHAEL WESLEY. ANU Press.
(2017). Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1sq5twz.11)

With negative attitudes towards the United States prevalent in
Thailand[, it is difficult to develop a common thread of strategic
thinking between the two countries]{.underline}. In principle, Thailand
maintains the alliance relationship with the United States, as
exemplified by the number of annual military cooperation initiatives in
which it is involved, including Cobra Gold and more than 50 other
bilateral and multilateral exercises. Operationally, the Thai military
command structure, weapons and overall interoperability remains highly
compatible with US forces. [In practice]{.underline}, however,
[Thailand, cautiously responding to America's pivot, sees the United
States as a difficult ally to work with]{.underline}. [Several events
point to that direction.]{.underline} The [Yingluck government
significantly delayed approval of the usage of the U-Tapao air
base]{.underline} for the SEAC4RS (Southeast Asia Composition, Cloud,
Climate Coupling Regional Study) in 2012. There was a concern that the
project might raise some suspicion from China about US spying activities
using the Thai air base. Likewise, [the current military government
under Prayut Chan-o-cha rejected a US aircraft basing
request]{.underline} in 2015.18 [This was in stark contrast to earlier
Thai responses to US calls to use the base for humanitarian assistance
and disaster relief (HADR)]{.underline} in the case of the 2004 tsunami,
the 2008 Cyclone Nargis, as well as the 2015 Nepal earthquake. Thailand
still cooperates with the United States, but tends to steer military
exercises and cooperation more towards HADR, so as not to make China
unhappy. In short, Thailand responded to the American pivot with
considerable reluctance.19 [To the disappointment of the United States,
such reluctance was felt despite the fact that Bangkok and Washington
have just signed the Joint Vision Statement for the Thai--US Defense
Alliance]{.underline} in 2012. Emphasising the 21st-century security
partnership, the joint statement aims to reinvigorate the alliance and
update the half-century-long Thanat--Rusk communiqué, which has always
been cited as the cornerstone of the US-- Thailand alliance.
Specifically, the new statement calls for a partnership for regional
security in South-East Asia, stability in the Asia-Pacific region and
beyond, bilateral and multilateral interoperability and readiness, as
well as relationship-building, coordination and collaboration at all
levels. As it turned out, the 2012 [joint statement falls short of the
aim of cementing alliance relations]{.underline}. Obviously, [the status
of the US alliance is not a current priority in Thai strategic thinking.
In recent defence white papers, there is no clear mention of the US
alliance and more emphasis is placed on ASEAN-led mechanisms and
multiple partners]{.underline}.20 [The US arms previously acquired by
the Thai military are ageing, a great many are nearing retirement, and
there have been few recent purchases. Understandably, Thailand prefers
less costly arms that come with technological transfer, and is trying to
diversify its sources of purchase]{.underline} by approaching China,
Ukraine, Sweden, Korea, Spain, Israel and Russia. The purchase of the
Swedish Gripen, rather than the American F-series jet fighters, is
indicative of this.

In Thai strategic thinking, the status of the US alliance is not at its
peak. Owing to this is the changing security environment and shifting
economic equation following the rise of China[. There are several
downsides in the US--Thailand alliance]{.underline}, stemming from
America's security identity, Thailand's increasing shared economic and
political interests with China and domestic politics. The general trend
is that [Thailand's relations with China are on the rise, while those
with the United States are in relative decline.]{.underline} At any
rate, the United States must accept the changing realities and
concentrate on what the two countries can do, rather than aiming
unrealistically towards common strategic thinking and action[. Thailand
is not likely to maximise the utility of its US alliance]{.underline},
but rather prefers to maximise its room for manoeuvring between major
powers. Hedging and limited alignments remains the viable choice for
small ally countries like Thailand.26 As Thailand tends to view
relations with major powers in various lights, the United States should
not concentrate on the security realm but rather seek to engage with its
ally in a multidimensional manner. Given the region's security, economic
and political environment, alliance management has become more difficult
but still manageable.

#### Thai-China relations strong. China successfully creating stronger ties in SE Asia.

**[Prasirtsuk 17]{.underline}** (Kitti Prasirtsuk IS. Chapter Title: An
Ally at the Crossroads: Thailand in the US Alliance System. Comparing US
Alliances in the 21st Century. Global Allies. MICHAEL WESLEY. ANU Press.
(2017). Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1sq5twz.11)

Since 2009, [China has become Thailand's largest export market,
surpassing the United States]{.underline}. By 2012, [China replaced
Japan as Thailand's top trade partner]{.underline}. In 2015, [Thailand
traded with China]{.underline} as much as 2.2 trillion baht (US\$65
billion), [which comprises 15 per cent of Thailand's total trade,
compared to the 1.3 trillion baht (US\$39 billion), or 9.1 per cent of
Thailand's total trade, that it traded with the United
States]{.underline}.14 Though Japan has remained Thailand's top
investor[, Chinese investments are steadily increasing]{.underline}.
Importantly, Chinese from mainland China represent the number one source
of tourists in the kingdom, as many as 7.9 million (26.5 per cent of
total tourists) in 2015.15 For Thailand, in fact, the turn to China is
not a recent phenomenon. Since the late 1970s, when Vietnam invaded
Cambodia and American troops left mainland South-East Asia, it was
essential for Thailand to seek help from China. As the frontline state,
Thailand was concerned at incursions by Vietnamese forces, particularly
when they crossed the Thai border to hunt down the Khmer Rouge. Beijing
responded by sending support to the anti-Vietnam Khmer Rouge as well as
cutting assistance to the underground Thai Communist Party. And, as
China waged a border war with Vietnam in early 1979, the Vietnamese
military shifted to the north. This changed the shape of regional
defence realities and formed the basis for the Sino--Thai alliance[. A
wide range of arms sales at 'friendship prices' was offered to Thailand,
including armoured vehicles, artillery and missiles.16 This pattern of
the Sino--Thai alliance continued despite the two coups in Thailand in
2006 and 2014. When the United States placed sanctions on Thailand after
the 2006 coup]{.underline}, especially in terms of security
cooperation[, China offered Thailand good deals on arms purchases and
other forms of assistance and cooperation. Notably, the Chinese provided
US\$49 million in military assistance, almost double the size of the
US\$24 million in US military assistance that was legally suspended in
accordance with Section 208 mentioned above.17]{.underline}

The Thai political crisis and the two coups should not be exaggerated as
the major reason for Thailand to lean toward China. [The trend has been
that way regardless of who is in government in Bangkok]{.underline},
whether elected or non-elected. [Economic interests with China represent
a strong incentive for any Thai Government to strengthen the relations
with China]{.underline}.  The  Thaksin government (2000--05) and the
Yingluck government (2011--14) opposed the Thai military and sought to
cultivate ties with China, [ranging from free trade agreements, the
lease of pandas, arms purchases and frequent high-level visits. The 2014
coup and the subsequent US antagonism only accelerated Thailand's
gravitation towards China.]{.underline}

More recently[, China continues to tempt ASEAN and other Asian nations
with even bolder initiatives.]{.underline} The Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank (AIIB) and the Belt and Road Initiative are two
examples, aimed at building and upgrading infrastructure to increase
connectivity in Asia. Recent train deals with Laos, Thailand and
Indonesia represent efforts in this regard, which will contribute to the
goal of ASEAN connectivity that was initially proposed and advocated by
Bangkok. Beijing also recently proposed the Lancang--Mekong Cooperation
Initiative to further cooperation among Mekong River riparian countries.
[The aim has not only been to ameliorate tensions]{.underline} and
concerns over China's dam construction, which significantly affects the
downstream countries, [but also to counterbalance the Lower Mekong --
Mississippi Cooperation, as proposed by the United States.]{.underline}
In addition, China and ASEAN are negotiating the Regional Comprehensive
Economic Partnership (RCEP), a pan-regional trade arrangement that also
involves Japan, Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand[. In short,
compared to the United States, China's engagement appears to have more
relevance to the interests of South-East Asia and Thailand.]{.underline}

In 2012[, Thailand and China elevated their relations to a comprehensive
strategic partnership]{.underline}. Since then, both sides have been
steadily following the plan through various schemes of cooperation and
exchanges, including frequent high-level visits, exchange of personnel
in commander and staff colleges, joint seminars and so on. Importantly,
both countries have expanded the Strike military exercises to cover army
and also, recently, air force.

[Thailand]{.underline}, therefore, arguably [has the closest
relationship with China, compared to other South-East Asian
nations]{.underline}. Short of a territorial dispute with China, the
relationship has been cordial. For instance, Thailand is the first
country in South-East Asia to host leased pandas from China since 2003.
In the so-called 'Panda Diplomacy', China leases pandas to only a
limited number of countries to signify the importance of relations.
Furthermore, in April 2012, Thailand's Defence Minister led a military
mission, including chiefs of army, navy and air force, to China and paid
a courtesy call to the then Vice President Xi Jinping. Such visits are
rare and, in the current military government, Prime Minister Prayut has
visited China several times, while Defence Minister Prawit Wongsuwan has
met with high-level defence counterparts on many occasions.

### [AT: Philippines]{.underline}

#### As the Philippines create their own alliances with U.S. adversaries, it gains leverage on its own ties with the United States

Robert Matthew **[Shines 16]{.underline}**, Analyst with the Foreign
Policy Association, \[Robert Matthew Shines, 9-16-2016, The
Philippines\' Improved Russian and Chinese Ties Increase Leverage with
U.S., Foreign Policy Blogs,
https://foreignpolicyblogs.com/2016/09/16/philippines-russian-chinese-leverage-us/\]

[The Philippines is the latest U.S. treaty ally that has
shown]{.underline} a proclivity for [a more independent role for itself
in the realm of international relations.]{.underline} This follows a
trend in which Turkey has reconciled, to an extent, relations with
Russia, as well as more independence shown by Japan in its own Russian
affairs. [The Philippines]{.underline} itself [is not only]{.underline}
[showing its own independence with respect to Russian relations, but to
Chinese relations as well.]{.underline} On the macro level, ASEAN as a
whole has seen its role as fulcrum to the region rise exponentially.
Once derided as a "talk shop", ASEAN itself is at the epicenter of
various competing "pivots" to the region. For example, despite its own
conflict with China in the East China Sea, Japan is gradually forging
its own pivot to the South China Sea as well in order to better balance
its historic rival. [Aside from Japan, Russia and India are also
implementing their own respective "pivots" to Southeast
Asia]{.underline} for their own respective agendas. India, still
suspicious of being navally encircled by China a la "String of Pearls",
is looking to gradually increase its South China Sea forward presence.
Although not technically allies, this no doubt pleases [the
U.S]{.underline}., which [is really looking]{.underline} [for
other]{.underline} major [powers to assist its own balance against
China.]{.underline} Russia's game in Southeast Asia is bit more
complicated. Russia's "Asian Pivot" serves multiple purposes. First, it
aims to offset decreased Western trade and investment flows due to
post-Ukraine sanctions with increased economic ties to China. However,
in order not to become too dependent on China, economically or
politically, Russia is looking to bolster its "pivot" portfolio. As a
result, Russia is seeking to improve ties with a range of regional
players, not only Japan, but Southeast Asian states Vietnam, and now the
Philippines. Additionally, Russia is looking to counterbalance U.S.
activities in its Eastern European and Central Asian spheres of
influence with a payback of sorts with activities of its own in the
U.S.' Northeast and Southeast Asian spheres of influence. Despite recent
controversial statements by its new President, the Philippines still
looks to the U.S. as a vital plank in its overall security calculus.
However, it is not the only plank. Most notably**[, the Philippines is
looking to gradually improve relations with China]{.underline}**. This
overture towards China comes despite the recent unfavorable ruling
against China by The Hague's Permanent Court of Arbitration regarding
conflicting South China Sea claims. Even though the Philippines
originally initiated the case, it has chosen to take a rather mature
path. This is because the Philippines is using the ruling as the start
of negotiations with China, rather than as a final end. Mirroring recent
Chinese comments that South China Sea disputes form only one component
of U.S.-China affairs and should not be allowed to poison the entire
relationship, the Philippines has made the same argument with respect to
Sino-Philippine relations**[. The Philippines]{.underline}** also
**[hope]{.underline}**s [this multi-vector foreign policy approach will
give it more independence and increased leverage with both the U.S. and
China]{.underline} in order to pursue its own interests. In contrast to
China, Russia has only relatively recently sought to improve economic
relations in earnest with Southeast Asia as a whole. As the Philippines
already is a member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)
and is eyeing possible TPP membership in the future, Russia's more
immediate value proposition to the Philippines lies in the political and
security realms. From the Filipino perspective, it is greatly
appreciated that Russia has expressed neutrality in the Philippines'
South China Sea conflict with China. Even though [Russia and
China]{.underline} have recently warmed relations considerably, they
still [are not formal treaty allies.]{.underline} [This]{.underline}
fact [not only]{.underline} [keeps the Philippines from
worrying]{.underline} about Russian support for Chinese claims in the
region, [but it also gives the Philippines enhanced leverage with both
China and the U.S.. This second fact is not to be taken
lightly.]{.underline} **[Even though the Philippines has a 2014 Visiting
Forces Agreement with the U.S.,]{.underline}** [the agreement is not
without controversy and the new Filipino President has promised to
review it.]{.underline} Even though the original idea behind the
agreement was to allow the Philippines to better balance China with U.S.
assistance, a Russian component is unavoidable. While **[it
may]{.underline}** also secretly **[see increased regional U.S. forces
as a deterrent to Chinese ambitions]{.underline}**, **[Russia's comfort
level with this presence is]{.underline}** definitely
[low]{.underline}er than the Philippines'. Just [**as the Philippines is
using the agreement to keep China in check**, it is simultaneously using
its own unease (and Russia's too) with the agreement to help keep the
U.S. in check as well.]{.underline} In summary, increasing
multi-polarity is allowing the Philippines more wiggle room in its
dealing with all major powers, akin to non-U.S. allies India and
Vietnam.

#### Philippines will say no---Russia can shore up deficit left by U.S.

[One of the weakest military forces in Southeast Asia is looking towards
Russia to beef up its defense]{.underline}. [After being denied
weapons]{.underline} -- and criticized in the U.S. media -- [for his
take-no-prisoners policy against the drugs mafia, Filipino President
Rodrigo Duterte has indicated he may turn to Moscow to provide his
country with weapons.]{.underline}

Last month after the U.S. government reportedly blocked the sale of
26,000 assault rifles for police use -- due to concerns over Duterte's
war on drugs in which around 2000 people have been killed -- the
Filipino strongman said: "I remember what the Russian diplomat said:
Come to Russia, we have anything you need here."

[The]{.underline} Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) [require an
urgent infusion of modern weapons, but what the AFP doesn't need are
expensive toys.]{.underline} High-performance -- and gas guzzling --
warplanes like the F-16 (offered by the U.S.) or the South Korean FA-50
Golden Eagle jet fighter are redundant for two reasons.

[One, the Philippines has no external enemies]{.underline}. [Two, Manila
will never be able to afford these jets]{.underline} in sufficient
numbers to be able to present a credible defense. "Let's contend
ourselves with the propeller-driven planes but which we can use
extensively in counter-insurgency,"
Duterte [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBO3ZBNMsRQ&feature=youtu.be&t=2166) at
a public meeting earlier this year. "I don't need jets, F-16 -- that's
of no use to us... we don't intend to fight any country."

About the FA-50s he said: "Why did you buy that?" Duterte. "What a waste
of money. You cannot use them for anti-insurgency, which is the problem
at the moment. You can only use these for ceremonial fly-by."

Clearly, [Manila's primary security threats are land-based -- communist
insurgents and Islamic groups who have been running a separatist
movement for decades]{.underline}. What [the AFP requires are light
ground attack aircraft that can be deployed against
terrorists]{.underline} in the dense forests of Southeast Asia. The
cheap and Syrian War tested Su-25 (NATO codename Frogfoot) is ideally
suited for this role. It is a heavily armored aircraft that would
provide Filipino troops close air support and is almost invulnerable to
small arms fire from the ground.

[If Moscow cannot spare sufficient numbers of the Su-25, its future
replacement is already here in the form of the Yakolev
Yak-130]{.underline}. At just \$15 million per unit, this subsonic
fighter is the friendly fighter for countries with limited budgets.
\"The Yak-130's multi-mission capabilities in training, air policing,
and counterinsurgency make it an attractive option for some customers
beyond
Russia,\" [says](https://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/russia-orders-yak-130-trainer-light-attack-jets-07229/) Defense
Industry Daily.

The Jamestown Foundation says because of the focus on the army, the
operational effectiveness of the Philippine Navy and Philippine Coast
Guard has suffered accordingly, leaving the country\'s sea lanes largely
unprotected. Having the eighth longest coastline (36,000 km) in the
world, the country is subject to porous borders and coastlines. Russian
short range missile boats -- which performed spectacularly in attacking
ISIS targets in the ongoing Syrian war -- could address this issue.

[The Philippines government has also approved for purchase attack
helicopters, long-range patrol aircraft and radar. Russia has a range of
battlefield support helicopters such as the Mi-17 and Mi-35 gunship,
which is being deployed by Afghanistan against the Taliban
terrorists.]{.underline}

In radar, [Russia has developed an insanely large variety of platforms
for tracking everything]{.underline} -- from cruise missiles to stealth
aircraft.

Manila's urgent requirement of assault rifles can be easily met. For,
Russian rifles are known to be among the most reliable, especially in
the damp Southeast Asian environment where the AK-47 has proven itself
in battle.

For more specialized counter-insurgency needs, the NSV
or [Utyos](https://sstroeff.wordpress.com/2016/12/12/new-light-arms-for-russia-why-not-for-india/) machine
gun uses the powerful 12.7 mm round, which is highly effective against
light armor as well as helicopters. But combatants value its range of
1500 meters that does not allow the enemy to approach within the
effective assault rifles range of 500-600 meters.

Predictably, Moscow is thrilled with Duterte's ovetures. "Formulate your
wish list," Igor Khovaev, Russia's ambassador to the country, told
Duterte. "Think of what kind of assistance you expect from Russia and we
will be ready to sit down with you and discuss what can and should be
done."

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has highlighted the
military-technical cooperation with the Philippines. The two sides
advocate promoting the bilateral collaboration,
Lavrov [said](http://www.saigon-gpdaily.com.vn/International/2016/12/122020/) after
meeting with Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Perfecto Yasay in
Moscow on Dec. 5.

[Last September, a Filipino delegation participated in the 'Army-2016'
International Military-Technical Forum, in which the Philippines had the
opportunity to study Russian weapons and equipment. Military vessels of
the two countries also visited each other's ports.]{.underline}

Philippine Secretary of National Defense Delfin Lorenzana was in Moscow
for talks with the Russian Minister of Defense Sergey Shoygu and
officials at the Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation.

[The outlook for Russia-Philippines defense ties looks
positive]{.underline}. [According](http://www.fsi.gov.ph/the-philippines-and-russia-prospects-for-security-cooperation/) to
Carlos D. Sorreta, former Director, Philippine Foreign Service Institute
and now the Philippine Ambassador in Moscow, [there are two clear
advantages Russian arms sales policies have over the West: "One, Russian
arms are more competitively priced. The other is that little to no
conditions are attached to these sales."]{.underline}

Also, diversifying weapons purchases should not be looked at as some
sort of complicated surgery involving separation of conjoined twins. A
number of countries have achieved what initially looked difficult.
India, which relies on Russia for 70 to 80 percent of its requirements,
is currently a major buyer of US and Israeli weapons.

Similarly, [[around](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-09-14/duterte-turns-back-us-orders-philippines-buy-weapons-russia-and-china) 75
percent of the Philippines' arms imports since the 1950s have come from
the U.S]{.underline}., according to Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute. [Manila will face censure for flirting with Russia
and its armed forces will also experience some adjustments issues but it
will all work to its advantage.]{.underline}

Anthony V. Rinna, an analyst on Russian foreign policy in East
Asia, [explains](http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2016/10/15/can-dutertes-diplomacy-have-it-all/):
"Countries have often faced difficulty when including Russia while
pursuing a multi-vectored foreign policy, particularly in terms of
formal integration. But in this case the [Philippines is not planning to
accede to an institutional security framework. Instead the Philippines
is aiming to diversify its partners in a way that allows it to expand
its options, potentially running counter to both U.S. and Chinese
interests."]{.underline}

### AT: Myanmar 

#### Leveraging Myanmar fails---U.S. needs to adopt strategic flexibility and stop promoting humanitarian interests. 

[**Marston et al. 18** (Hunter Marston,]{.underline} a Carnegie Council
Robert J. Myers Fellow and writes widely on Myanmar and U.S. foreign
policy; Abigail Chen, student at Cornell, "What the US Can Learn from
China and India's Engagement with Myanmar,"

[Washington and Brussels recently levied new economic sanctions against
certain Myanmar military officers in connection with the atrocities of
the Rohingya crisis]{.underline} unfolding in the country's western
Rakhine state, where thousands of the Muslim minority group have died
and hundreds of thousands more have fled across the border to
Bangladesh. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid
Ra'ad al-Hussein, [has
called](https://frontiermyanmar.net/en/un-rights-chief-slams-investigative-whitewash-and-calls-for-icc-referral) for
the country to be referred to the International Criminal Court.

[While these efforts would seem to indicate an emerging international
consensus on the need to confront the government of Aung San Suu Kyi and
the military commanders]{.underline}, some countries oppose condemnation
and insist on engaging Naypyidaw. Most notably, [Myanmar's neighbors
China and India have important roles to play in the impoverished and
conflict-stricken country's reconstruction and political
stability]{.underline}. The contrast in their policies of engagement
compared to Washington and the European Union's more activist stances
highlights possible room for improvement on the part of Western nations,
whose humanitarian impulses have failed to influence Aung San Suu Kyi
and the military's calculations.

[Beijing and New Delhi]{.underline}, both of which have maintained
high-level visits and exchanges with Naypyidaw, [prioritize engagement
and investment over values-based or human rights diplomacy to address
the Rohingya crisis]{.underline}. China, in the [three-stage
plan](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2120607/china-lays-out-three-point-plan-ease-rohingya-crisis) it
proposed last November, and India, in a
recent [statement](http://www.mea.gov.in/rajya-sabha.htm?dtl/29217/QUESTION+NO658+TALKS+WITH+MYANMAR+ON+ROHINGYA+MIGRANTS) by
the Minister of External Affairs, emphasize economic development as the
solution to the Rakhine state crisis.

Some elements of the development push are already underway. China and
Myanmar are close to inking
a [deal](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/65044890.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=cppst)on
building an economic corridor through Rakhine, while India is
making [progress](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/hdV9E00I5CwSrKmSheAu6M/IndiaMyanmarThailand-Trilateral-Highway-by-2019-Nitin-Gad.html) in
the construction of the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway.
Additionally, the World
Bank [offered](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/world-bank-offers-myanmar-100m-for-rakhine-development-118071001173_1.html) \$100
million in aid to Myanmar for job creation and enterprise development.

Meanwhile, [Washington has wavered]{.underline}, with policymakers
expressing grave concern [over the country's deteriorating human rights
while members of Congress are mulling new sanctions]{.underline}. As
[the United States finds its pressure tactics unable to meaningfully
improve conditions for the Rohingya, it is worth considering alternative
modes of diplomacy]{.underline}. China and India's approaches may shed
some light upon a productive engagement that the Trump administration
could adopt.

Beneath the veneer of alignment, [Beijing and New Delhi are battling for
influence in Myanmar.]{.underline}

[India [has
slammed](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/china-road-initiative-is-like-a-colonial-enterprise-india/articleshow/58664098.cms) China's
Belt and Road Initiative for its questionable financial practices and
the "debt burden" that it would create in Myanmar]{.underline}.
Moreover[, it has particularly objected to the China-Pakistan Economic
Corridor, which crosses Pakistan-administered Kashmi]{.underline}r, a
territory India also claims. Furthermore, the two "dueling ports" in
Myanmar -- the China-proposed Kyaukphyu [deep-sea
port](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/myanmar-negotiating-with-chinese-consortium-on-deep-sea-port-project-in-rakhine-state) in
western Rakhine, and the India-built Sittwe port in Rakhine's capital
city -- are already [stirring
unease](http://regionalrapport.com/2017/08/15/gwadar-and-chabahar-arent-china-and-indias-only-dueling-ports/) over
the tense relations between the two countries.

Despite these adversarial aspects, [China and India's converging
economic and security interests in Rakhine have driven them to pursue a
similar track of pragmatic engagement.]{.underline}

Sandwiched between China and India, [Myanmar is a key interface for the
two countries' ambitious infrastructure initiatives]{.underline} -- part
of Xi's Belt and Road Initiative and Modi's Act East policy. Besides
apparent interests in economic gains, both countries worry that local
terrorism may affect their investments in Rakhine or even spill over
into their own territories. Recognizing the two countries' symmetric
interests, the Chinese state-run **[Global Times]{.underline}** [has
called for](http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1070428.shtml) China and
India to jointly lead the efforts in solving the Rohingya crisis.

In June, echoing China and India's enthusiasm about the infrastructure
push, a high-level Myanmar
official [remarked](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:M7pQ8kns6S8J:https://www.iiss.org/-/media/images/dialogues/sld/sld-2018/documents/security-and-humanitarian-crisis-in-myanmars-rakhine-state-sld18.ashx%3Fla%3Den%26hash%3D4663620F9D9AAF4AEA011035DB7419ADF72E99BB+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us),
"[if Rakhine is prosperous, nobody is going to squabble about what
religion you belong to.]{.underline}"

The tendency to reduce the drivers of the ethno-religious tensions to
poverty is problematic. Rakhine's chronic under-development is not out
of coincidence, but because of institutional structures that
systematically disenfranchise it. To achieve long-term stability and
political reconciliation, sustained efforts to build inclusive legal,
educational, and cultural infrastructures are crucial; so are measures
to ensure fair distribution of wealth gains to locals. It remains to be
seen whether Beijing and Delhi's engagement and investment strategy
represent a sustainable solution to the Rohingya crisis.

[Given Naypyitaw's aversion to Washington's maximalist demands and
hectoring statements regarding the deterioration of human rights in
Myanmar, the Trump administration must adjust its policy if it is to
retain any leverage.]{.underline} As Washington and European countries
denounce Suu Kyi and Myanmar's armed forces with increasing intensity,
what the civilian government needs most is diplomatic and economic
support.

First, [Washington should abandon its maximalist demands on Aung San Suu
Kyi's leadership and instead adopt more strategic
flexibility]{.underline}. [A one-track devotion to sanctions and
denunciation means that all other priorities, including economic
development, must queue up behind them]{.underline}. This is not to say
that human rights do not matter nor that U.S. policy should jettison its
values. But the maximalist and values-based approach is neither working
in the best interests of U.S. influence, nor alleviating the plight of
the Rohingya. Promisingly, senior White House official Matt
Pottinger [recently
encouraged](https://frontiermyanmar.net/en/us-to-continue-support-for-myanmar-senior-official) American
investment in Myanmar, which appears in line with China and India's
"development first" approach.

Second, [the U.S. government should separate its long-term interest in
promoting liberal values from near-term humanitarian needs]{.underline}.
Again, we are not encouraging the United States to abandon its human
rights concerns, but [it must consider a more pragmatic approach that
engages **with **Myanmar decision-makers rather than alienating them as
well as their people]{.underline}. The Rohingya and Rakhine citizens on
both sides of the Myanmar-Bangladesh border require urgent political
solutions to bring an end to violence and rebuild the lives and homes of
those displaced by conflict. Competition for influence in Myanmar
undeniably forms the strategic backdrop, but in the long-term,
supporting peace and development are smarter strategies to win and keep
influence.

In Israel, [human rights activists have petitioned the Israeli High
Court to halt
sales](http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/Israel-arming-Myanmar-amid-ongoing-Rohingya-crackdown-478788243) of
military weapons and equipment to Myanmar. Eitay Mack, the lawyer
presenting the petition said that [Israel has been opaque over the
nature of its longstanding relationship with Myanmar, but the internet
has provided his legal team with significant information that is public
and hard for Israel to ignore.]{.underline}

\"[Israel could be considered as compliant in crimes against humanity,
it\'s enough that Israel knows that this is happening and the weapons
and training it sends to Myanmar could be used for its
crime]{.underline}s,\" Mack told CNN.

Sen. General Min Aung Hlaing visited Israel in 2015, toured military and
naval bases, and published everything on his Facebook page, Mack said.
\"It was secret in Israel but then I found it on Facebook. It\'s a
public thing and hard for them to argue.\"

During the 2015 visit [the [Myanmar generals \"disclosed that they had
purchased Super Dvora patrol boats from
Israel](http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/1.810390), and there was talk of
additional purchases]{.underline},\" an article in Israel\'s Ha\'aretz
noted.

Israeli company TAR Ideal Concepts, whose leadership includes a[ former

published advertisements, Mack said, that included[ images of forces
undergoing
training](http://www.tarideal.com/News/2701/ISRAELI_CORNERSHOT_IN_MYANMAR).
The post is titled \"special weapons systems in Asia,\" but the flag of
Myanmar is visible in one of the images.

Asked for comment about the lawsuit and the state of sales to Myanmar,
the Israeli Foreign Affairs Ministry told CNN: \"[Israel denies
categorically the false information in the media regarding a so called
involvement in the tragedy in the Rakhine province in
Myanmar.\"]{.underline} The Israeli defense ministry said it \"does not
comment on matters relating to defense exports.\"

Longtime Myanmar observer Andrew Selth says [the military does not want
to run Myanmar, but it does intend to protect its people and its
position in the country.]{.underline} Its nationalism will[ \"be cited
to justify military operations against ethnic armed groups and, if
considered necessary, the
Rohingya,\" ](https://www.griffith.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/1087977/Regional-Outlook-Paper-56-Selth-web.pdf)he
writes.

What should be of great concern for Myanmar, says Selth, is the
possibility that people within the armed forces want to \"slow down the
reform process or to preserve certain perks and privileges.\"

The older officers grew wealthy through the military\'s control over the
government, and \"it has been suggested, for example, that some younger
officers resent the fact that current and proposed changes to Myanmar
society may deny them the opportunities for personal enrichment enjoyed
by their predecessors.\"

For as long as experts can see, [the military will remain the real power
in Myanmar, and there will be little Aung San Suu Kyi can do about
it.]{.underline}

TAIPEI, TAIWAN - **[Vietnam's Communist Party head will have
unprecedented power to keep relations stable with old foe China while
pursuing stronger trade and security ties with the United
States]{.underline}** as he exercises his duties as the nation's new
president. The legislature in Hanoi confirmed Communist Party General
Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong as president Tuesday. He replaced Tran Dai
Quang, a low-key leader with a police background, after Quang died last
month from a long illness. Trong is scheduled to serve as president at
least until 2021. **[Trong's double role as president and party head
will let him mold a wealth of political experience into foreign and
economic policy]{.underline}**, Vietnam specialists say. In particular,
Trong will get more access to foreign heads of state, who often do not
see party heads as key political figures. "As general secretary, it's
hard to know how internationally how to treat them, but as president,
you're acknowledged, they understand what presidents are," said Adam
McCarty, chief economist with Mekong Economics in Hanoi. "[As
president-general secretary, he'll be]{.underline} expected to have a
lot more power and therefore be [treated as a more serious player than
just a president visiting other countries]{.underline}," McCarty said.
Trong, now 74, came from a "poor peasant" background and graduated from
a linguistics program at Hanoi General University, his party's website
says. He joined the party 51 years ago and has held five tenures in its
Political Bureau. In 42 years of rule by the Communist Party of Vietnam,
only its founder Ho Chi Minh ever served as both party head and
president, but Vietnam lacked then today's level of foreign relations or
world economic clout. Normally, the party chief and president
effectively share power. Trong's role resembles that of Chinese
President Xi Jinping, also chief of the Communist Party of China. Trong
all but naturally became president because he was "first among equals"
in the party and faced no challengers in the top ranks, said Murray
Hiebert, deputy director of the Southeast Asia Program at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington. [Trong can more
easily actualize his policies in government]{.underline}, he said.
**[Trong's appointment this week is unlikely to change long-term
government ambitions]{.underline}** **[such as]{.underline}** fostering
an export-driven economy or **[striking a foreign policy balance between
China and Western allies]{.underline}**, analysts say. One business
person in the financial hub, Ho Chi Minh City, who did not want to be
named for fear of angering the government, told VOA this week that
common Vietnamese had little reaction to the leadership changes because
it brought no tangible change such as health care reform or lower
consumer prices. But [the president's dual role will give him easier
access to U.S. leaders.]{.underline} **[He is expected to push the
United States for a bilateral trade deal]{.underline}** as President
Donald Trump shows interest in two-way pacts. Last year Trump pulled out
of a 12-member Trans Pacific Partnership that included Vietnam. [Vietnam
counts the United States as its No. 1 export market]{.underline}, worth
\$33 billion per year, or 20 percent of all goods shipped[.
But]{.underline} Trong [may need to overcome a U.S. view that communist
Vietnam lacks a market economy]{.underline}, said Carl Thayer, professor
emeritus with the University of New South Wales in Australia.
**[Washington might get a request as well to offer Vietnam more military
aid, a growing option since the U.S. government lifted an arms sales ban
in 2016]{.underline}**, scholars say. **[The Vietnamese president will
use existing party-to-party as well as state-to-state channels to work
with China]{.underline}**, yet without coming off as pro-Beijing,
scholars believe. In the past, party and government talks were held by
different people. No one in Vietnam is "pro-China," Thayer said, but
some are more willing than others to work with it. "The policies on
China to me are set and they provide a special conduit for relations
that Vietnam can use," he said. [China is Vietnam's second biggest
export destination and a top supplier of raw materials]{.underline} to
factories [that drive a fast-growing Vietnamese economy]{.underline}.
But the two countries fought a border war in the 1970s and now contest
sovereignty over parts of the South China Sea. China took control of the
disputed Paracel Islands in the 1970s and the two sides now compete for
undersea oil drilling rights. "He can be expected to continue to try to
balance Vietnam's relations between China and the United States,"
Hiebert said. "**[He will look to China for trade and investment and to
Washington for security support as China becomes more aggressive in the
South China Sea]{.underline}**." Vietnam's anti-corruption campaign that
became visible to the public in 2016 is likely to intensify under Trong,
according to the domestic news website VnExpress International says. It
cites "numerous" crackdowns on top business people and government
leaders to date. Trong frowns on overtly lavish lifestyles, a hallmark
of corruption, Thayer said.

### AT: Leahy 

#### The Leahy approach empirically fails in the Phillipines -- Congressional power can be circumvented and no US leverage

**Miller,** attorney in New York, **2012**

(Nathanael Tenorio, "The Leahy Law: Congressional Failure, Executive
Overreach, and the Consequences," Cornell International Law Journal,
Vol. 45,

Accessed 7/13/19 DDI-GN)

IV\. [The Effectiveness of the Leahy Law in the Philippines]{.underline}

From the end of World War II until the early 1990s, the United States
operated several major military facilities in the Philippines.134 Since
2002, despite constant pressure to reassign the soldiers to Afghanistan
or Iraq, six hundred elite U.S. soldiers have been deployed to the Joint
Special Operations Task Force-Philippines.135 These Army Special Forces,
known as Green Berets, have been training Filipino forces and providing
logistical and intelligence support.136 [Despite the presence of U.S.
forces, the State Department's 2011 report on human rights in the
Philippines was highly critical of the Philippine
government]{.underline}.137 [The second paragraph of the report said the
following: Arbitrary, unlawful, and extrajudicial killings by elements
of the security services and political killings, including killings of
journalists, by a variety of state and non-state actors continued to be
serious problems]{.underline}. [Concerns about impunity
persisted.]{.underline} Members of the security services physically and
psychologically abused suspects and detainees, and there were instances
of torture. Pretrial detainees and convicts were often held in
overcrowded, substandard conditions. Disappearances occurred, and
arbitrary or warrantless arrests and detentions were common. Trials were
delayed, and procedures were prolonged. Corruption was endemic. Leftist
[and human rights activists reported harassment by local security
forces.]{.underline} [Problems such as violence against women, abuse of
children, child sexual exploitation, trafficking in persons, child
labor, and ineffective enforcement of worker rights were
common.]{.underline}138 The State Department's report further outlined a
number of other human rights violations that had occurred in the
Philippines. In 2010, the Philippine Commission on Human Rights (CHR),
an independent government agency, investigated fifty-three new
complaints of politically motivated killings involving sixty-seven
victims.139 The CHR suspected that some of the leftist activists killed
were the targets of personnel from the Philippine National Police (PNP)
and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP).140 The PNP task force
responsible for monitoring extrajudicial killings had recorded 161
killings since 2001.141 Of these 161 cases, 99 were filed in court and
prosecutors' offices, 61 were under investigation, and 1 was closed.142
During 2010, there was not a single conviction of a state actor.143 The
human rights abuses are not limited to extra-judicial killings. The CHR
found that PNP and AFP forces were implicated in five of ten
disappearance cases in 2010.144 During that year there were no
developments in earlier disappearance cases. The State Department report
stated, "\[i\]nvestigative and judicial inaction on previous cases of
disappearance contributed to a climate of impunity . . . ."145 The State
Department identified Philippine police, military, and law enforcement
officers as suspects in twenty-two cases of alleged torture involving
ninety-three victims.146 The U.S. government has been concerned with the
AFP and the PNP for several years. In 2005, the U.S. embassy in Manila
dispatched a cable describing the situation: The PNP management is a
mess. Few PNP officials would even try to deny this reality . . . .
\[D\]aily exposure to corrupt, inefficient, or badly managed police
officials is a cancer upon the body politic. Systemic flaws need
institutional reforms . . . . In the absence of such systemic PNP
reform, popular impatience for better police performance and
management--- exacerbated by the belief that nearly everyone in the PNP
is corrupt--- may also encourage more public support for elected
officials, such as the mayors of Davao and Cebu, who have openly
supported the use of extra-judicial killings, coordinated in concert
with local police forces under their control, as a means of controlling
crime . . . . Such an outcome would be disastrous to the human rights
climate in this treaty ally and democratic partner, and would also
undermine or harm progress on major USG goals here to combat terrorism,
narcotics trafficking, trafficking in persons, and other transnational
problems.147 Two years later, in 2007, Keith Luse, a senior
congressional staff member, had a series of meetings with Philippine
government officials, embassy staff, and NGOs.148 W[hile meeting with
senior Philippine officials, Luse conveyed "serious Congressional
concern about extrajudicial killings and explained that his trip was
essentially a fact-finding visit to learn first-hand about the
issue."]{.underline}149 In response, the Philippine Department of
Foreign Affairs Undersecretary cited a number of steps the Philippine
government had taken and stressed that the New People's Army (NPA), the
armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines, had conducted many
of the killings in a purge.150 The Philippine National Deputy Security
Adviser's explanation echoed the Undersecretary's comment, adding that,
"to the extent the Philippine military was involved, it was 'rogue
elements' within it . . . ."151 In his comments, [the Security Adviser
cited the Melo Commission, an investigation into extrajudicial
killings]{.underline} that President Gloria MacapagalArroyo started in
2006. [The report offered a qualified critique of the military,
dismissing the idea that the extrajudicial killings were part of an
internal NPA purge]{.underline}.152 Much of the Melo report centered on
General Jovito Palparan, now both a Filipino Congressman and a
fugitive.153 Between February and August of 2005, Palparan commanded the
8th Infantry Division in the Eastern Visayas, and between September 2005
and September 2006 he commanded the 7th Infantry Division in Central
Luzon.154 Activists nicknamed Palparan "Berdugo," or "Butcher."155 While
the Melo report was unable to arrive at definite conclusion, it was
highly critical of Palparan: The rise in killings somehow became more
pronounced in areas where General Palparan was assigned. The trend was
so unusual that General Palparan was said to have left a trail of blood
or bodies in his wake wherever he was assigned. He "earned" the moniker
"Berdugo" from activist and media groups for his reputation. General
Palparan ascribes his grisly reputation to his enemies, as part of their
propaganda campaign to discredit him and to denigrate his excellent
performance in implementing the various missions and programs assigned
to him by his superiors. General Palparan, clearly the man in the center
of the maelstrom, admits to having uttered statements openly encouraging
persons to perform extrajudicial killings against those suspected of
being communists, albeit unarmed civilians. Worse, he was reported to
have "expressed delight" at the disappearance of at least two persons,
mere students, but who were suspected of being communist or
activists.156 On May 4, 2011, mothers of two missing University of the
Philippines students filed a criminal case against Palparan.157 The case
alleges that the General and several of his officers were guilty of
rape, causing serious physical injuries, arbitrary detention, and
maltreatment of prisoners.158 The complaint cites a farmer who was also
abducted and has since testified in court.159 The witness says that he
saw several men torturing the students.160 As of January 2012,
Philippine authorities were still searching for Palparan,161 and there
is a 1 million peso (approximately \$23,100) reward for his capture.162
While Palparan commanded the 7th Infantry Division, [the United States
trained soldiers under his command on at least six different
occasions.163 **This was despite the fact that the U.S. embassy in
Manila knew of the accusations of human rights violations**.
In]{.underline} a cable entitled "Left-Wing Activists Remain a Target in
the Philippines," the embassy discussed and dismissed the accusations
against Palparan, saying: Leftist organizations continue to blame
elements of the GRP, especially the police and the AFP, for carrying out
the attacks. Increasingly, critics are pointing to Major General Jovito
Palparan Jr., the commander of the 7th Infantry Division in Central
Luzon, who has been accused of human rights abuses in the past (though
such allegations have never been proven). Palparan, who was recently
awarded the Philippine Distinguished Service Star for meritorious
actions as a division commander in Luzon and Samar, has dismissed
allegations linking him to any extra-judicial killings, stating, "Those
are all just propaganda to destroy the image of the government." The AFP
has challenged leftist groups to go to court to prove their
allegations.164 [In 2009, in response to unprosecuted extra-judicial
killings, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution
withholding \$2 million of the \$30 million requested for FMF to the
Philippines for FY 2010]{.underline}.165 [The House tied the money to
efforts to prosecute those suspected of extra-judicial
killings.]{.underline}166 **[The Obama Administration then lobbied
Congress to get the restrictions removed]{.underline}**.167 Eventually,
**[FY 2010 saw \$29 million in FMF disbursed to the
Philippines]{.underline}**.168 [In FY 2012, the State Department CBJ has
requested \$15 million for FMF to the Philippines.169 The funding
requests for the Philippines demonstrate the relative inability of
Congress to exert its political will,]{.underline} even when the amount
of funding is relatively low. Moreover, the [Philippines, a former U.S.
colony that has maintained strong military ties to the United States,
still suffers from human rights abuses]{.underline}. This indicates that
[joint training exercises and close cooperation between the U.S. and
Philippine militaries are, on their own, not enough to stem human rights
abuses]{.underline}.

#### Leahy vetting prioritizes local accounts over human rights agencies -- credibility standard creates a massive loophole

[Assessing what constitutes credible allegations is one of the thorniest
issues in Leahy implementation]{.underline}. [The vetting process is one
of many where human rights advocates face escalating demands for
institutional transparency]{.underline} [and the production of evidence
meeting legal standards, including identifiable and credible witnesses
and supporting documentation and expert knowledge about weaponry, troop
movements and identities]{.underline}, all extremely difficult to
procure in complex conflict situations. Anthropologists and others have
explored the ways in which "credibility" as an epistemological category
is culturally produced, and how the measures of violence is itself a
contested process (Andreas and Greenhill 2010; Comaroff and Comaroff
2006; Rosa and Satterthwaite 2009). Anthropologists examining the role
of truth commissions have explored the multiple ways in which public
accusations of wrongdoing are socially produced, 8 including the
critical space of silences (Ross 2010), the gendered dimensions of such
pronouncements (Theidon 2010) and the role of post-conflict fear shaping
public discourses about histories of violence. In this case,
[credibility functions as a kind of social capital that is achieved
through specific kinds of knowledge practices or accrued through
institutional positioning. Some NGOs are known to have more
sophisticated, standardized and rigorous reporting
practices]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} [are]{.underline} thus [more
credible]{.underline} than other NGOs. [To the US government, Colombian
government agencies are considered inherently more credible than NGOs,
with governmental reporting and judicial investigations -- and dismissal
of such investigations --]{.underline} **[weighted more heavily than NGO
reporting]{.underline}**. Of the NGOs, [hierarchies of credibility
include national groups over regional, professional over volunteer,
international over national]{.underline} (Tate 2007). These hierarchies
of credibility also apply among and within governmental agencies. US
governmental agencies are more credible than Colombian agencies; for
officials from both governments, [human rights focused
agencies]{.underline} (such as the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and
Labor, DRL, in the State Department and the Colombian Human Rights
Ombudsman) [are less credible than other agencies]{.underline}. 16

#### Lack of standards to determine the credibility of sources undermines Leahy's effectiveness

[The normative and deterrent value of the Leahy laws, however, is
overshadowed by significant gaps and weaknesses**. A key weakness is the
absence of clear standards for determining the credibility of sources
during the Leahy vetting pro cess.**]{.underline} [DoS guidance explains
that vetters must deter- mine whether information is credible on a case-
by- case basis, depending on the source's reputation and the presence of
corroborating evidence]{.underline}. [This approach relies on the
discretion of individual officers, who might reach differ ent
conclusions based on the same information.]{.underline} In some
instances, [local populations will report information differently to DoD
sources than to civil society organ izations. Additionally, egregious
human rights abuses may occur in areas with limited media and NGO
access]{.underline}, which affects the perceived credibility of a
claim.7 [Another challenge is the confusion surrounding whether the unit
itself or every individual in the unit must be vetted.]{.underline} DoS
considers the relevant unit to be "the lowest orga nizational ele ment
of a security force capable of exercising command and discipline over
its members, typically residing at the battalion level."8 [Human rights
groups charge that this is too narrow and that vetting should go as high
as pos si ble, while some DoD officials have complained that vetting
officials apply Leahy too broadly]{.underline}, occasionally denying
assistance to units that are clean except for the presence of one or two
"bad apples."

#### Inconsistent communication about Leahy to other countries destroys leverage -- other countries don't know why aid is withheld

Although the FY 2017 NDAA attempted to bridge the gap between the DoD
and DoS Leahy laws, **[some inconsistencies still exist that send mixed
messages to partner countries and may allow for national security
imperatives to supersede human rights priorities]{.underline}**. First,
although DoD and DoS have taken the useful step of developing common
criteria for remediation, [the pro cess has been used infrequently, with
lost opportunities for using remediation as a tool to encourage partner
accountability and prevent future abuses]{.underline}. Second, [the DoS
Leahy provisions mandate that a partner country in violation of human
rights obligations be informed of the reason that security assistance is
being withheld. DoD does not have the same provision to mandate a "duty
to inform" the partner.]{.underline} As a result, [the duty to inform is
applied unevenly, and partner governments are often not aware of why
certain units were denied assistance.]{.underline} In the interest of
advancing trust in the relationship with the partner, [DoD increasingly
has sought to encourage its security cooperation officers and atta- chés
to explain the reasons for the withholding of assistance and the steps
the partner can take to implement reform and accountability mea sures to
inform U.S. decisionmaking]{.underline} [on the pos si ble resumption of
assistance.]{.underline}11 Third, DoD allows for a waiver that overrides
the Leahy laws, allowing for the provision of security assistance to
units that have committed gross violations of human rights.12 Moreover,
**[as Leahy applies to par tic u lar units and not countries as a whole,
it is pos si ble to continue security assistance to countries with
egregious human rights rec ords so long as assistance does not go to a
tainted unit.]{.underline}** [It is also pos si ble that a unit will
commit violations after it has passed vetting, since Leahy laws are not
retroactive]{.underline}.13 [While proponents of Leahy laws argue that
the differences in the DoD and DoS laws provide the United States with
the "flexibility to balance potentially competing interests, or to
respond to an emerging threat or disaster in a timely
manner,"]{.underline} **[these inconsistencies may obfuscate the
original intent of the laws to uphold human rights
standards]{.underline}**.14
