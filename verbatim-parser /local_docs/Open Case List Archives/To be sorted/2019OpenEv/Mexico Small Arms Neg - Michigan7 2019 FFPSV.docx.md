The Arms Trade: The US-Mexico Connection [The United States is a major
supplier for arms to Mexico]{.underline}.9 [The number of arms
trafficked from the United States to Mexico has proliferated over
time]{.underline}. In 1993, the mid-range estimates place the total
number of arms trafficked from the United States to Mexico at 134,045.
The high-end estimate, however, places the number of arms trafficked at
241,501. The total volume of arms trafficked between the United States
and Mexico declined between 1994 and 1996 as mid-range estimates placed
the number at 92,001, while high-end estimates were 164,591. Between
1997 and 1999, the high-end estimate for arms trafficked was 152,142.
However, **[the period between 2010 and 2012 witnessed a substantial
increase in arms trafficking. Mid-range estimates place the number of
arms trafficked at 252,906, while the high-end estimate is
426,729]{.underline}**.10 Some research indicates that there are 2,000
weapons that cross the Mexican border from the United States illegally
every day. **[According to data from Mexico's governmental research
service, the vast majority---85 percent---of the weapons in Mexico are
not legal]{.underline}**.11 Moreover, certain states in the United
States are major sources of firearms that are transported to Mexico.12
In particular, US border states are major suppliers of guns in Mexico:
California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. According to data between
2009 and 2014, Texas accounted for 41.3 percent of the firearms of US
origin seized in Mexico, which equates to 13,628. On the other hand,
California accounted for 18.6 percent---6,153---of the firearms seized
in Mexico, while Arizona represented 14.6 percent, which equates to
4,809.13 The number of firearm seizures by Mexican authorities has
increased over time. In 2006, for example, Mexican authorities seized
10,500 arms. However, the number of seizures spiked to 29,824 in 2008
from 9,553 in 2007. By 2009, authorities seized 32,332 arms.14 On
December 19, 2009, the Mexican Army found more than 6,700 rounds of
ammunition and 41 assault rifles when carrying out operations and
raiding a house in Cuernavaca. An individual living in the neighborhood
spoke with her son, a police commander named Emilio Guzmán Montejo, to
alert him of the situation. Authorities arrested Guzmán Montejo upon his
arrival to the stash house. Steven Dudley, a crime expert, contends:
"The Guzmán Montejo case illustrated two apparent patterns in the arms
trafficking business in Mexico: the involvement of active or retired law
enforcement and the use, possibly, of family members to serve as
couriers and keepers of the weapons."15 Between 2009 and 2014, 70
percent (73,684) of the arms apprehended in Mexico and traced by the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) were of US
origin, demonstrating the high percentage of US arms production that was
supplied to Mexico. During the same period, only 17 percent of the arms
seized in Mexico and trace by the ATF were classified as non-US origin.
The arms seized can be broken down into short guns, such as 9 mm or 0.38
caliber and long guns, which are AR type and 12-gauge pump action
shotgun. T[here has been a consistent supply of arms, both short guns
and long guns, from the United States to Mexico.]{.underline}
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) seized 530 short guns in the
United States destined to Mexico in 2009. The number of short guns
seized spiked to 715 in 2012. The flow of seizures declined in recent
years but has remained relatively high: 649 seizures in 2013 and 572 in
2014. ICE authorities have seized a consistent number of long guns. In
2009, for example, ICE seized 393 long guns in the United States headed
for Mexico. The number of long guns seized declined to 282 in 2010 but
spiked to 490 in 2012. By 2014, the ICE authorities seized 350 long guns
(see Fig. 7.4). While the number of seizures can demonstrate that law
enforcement is combating arms trafficking, the seizure data can provide
a false sense of victory. In other words, increases in seizures can mean
that arms trafficking is increasing. The numbers do not reveal how many
weapons have not been seized.16 The arms trade is a very lucrative
business. The estimated dollar values of the arms trafficked between the
United States and Mexico has increased substantially over time. In 1993,
the estimated high-end value of the dollar amount of the arms trafficked
was \$60,220. During the 2010--2012 period, the value of the arms
trafficked was \$214,569. The large dollar amount of the arms trade
means that arms dealers depend on the weapons sales to Mexico. In fact,
approximately half of the firearm dealers residing in the United States
depend on the high levels of demand in Mexico.17 President Felipe
Calderón (2006--2012) has been an outspoken critic of the flow of arms
from the United States to Mexico. In February 2009, he contended that
the flow of guns entering Mexico from the United States must be
combated. [Calderón highlighted the wide array of arms that originated
from the United States that have been seized in Mexico, contending: "Let
me express to you that we've seized in this two years more than 25,000
weapons and guns, and more than 90 percent of them came from United
States,]{.underline} and I'm talking from missiles launchers to machine
guns and grenades."18 [A major problem has been the ease of access to
guns**, particularly at gun shows that occur along the bord**er. Critics
of the easy access to guns have argued that **the United States should
clamp down on the access to firearms.**]{.underline} Julia E. Sweig, an
expert on security and Latin America-related issues, contends that ["the
U.S. civilian firearms market continues to supply the region's
transnational criminal networks with high-powered weaponry that is
purchased with limited oversight, especially from unlicensed individuals
at **gun shows**, **flea markets**, **pawn shops**, **and on the
Internet**]{.underline}. Lax U.S. gun laws enable straw purchasers,
including those under investigation in Operation Fast and Furious, to
legally procure thousands of AK-47 and AR-15 variants every year and
traffic them across the border to sell them illegally to criminal
factions."19

#### Mexico's main supply comes from illegal markets

**Godnick et al '02 (**William Godnick with Robert Muggah and Camilla
Waszink, Godnick is Policy Advisor for Latin America for International
Alert's Security and Peace-building Programme, "Stray Bullets: The
Impact of Small Arms Misuse in Central America", 03/02,

At present, [public US sources indicate that commercial retail sales of
firearms and illegal black-market sales have surpassed
government-to-government deals in terms of quantity and
value]{.underline}. For example, for the years 1996--99, using data
provided by the US government and organized by the Norwegian Initiative
on Small Arms Transfers (NISAT), the US government collectively
delivered USD 376,000 worth of small arms to the governments of Costa
Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, and Panama---including ammunition of
multiple calibres, grenades, 73 short arms, and 15 machine guns. After
the same period, the US government authorized private industry to sell
USD 66,167,402 worth of arms to Central American markets, including
93,855 pistols and revolvers, 28,345 rifles (non-assault), 400
sub-machine guns, and approximately 270 million rounds of ammunition,
although there is no publicly available confirmation of actual sales
(NISAT, 2001). Data provided by the US Bureau of the Census (see Table
4), which includes both government-to-government and private commercial
sales for the same period as well as for 1994--95, indicates that actual
Central American small-arms imports did not surpass or Occasional Paper
No. 5 Small Arms Survey Page 6 [The Impact of Small Arms Misuse in
Central America come near to authorized quantities in most categories.
However, there is a marked discrepancy between the 40,369 shotguns
exported to Central American countries between 1994 and 1998 and the 906
authorized for commercial sale for the years 1996--99]{.underline} (US
Department of Commerce, 2000). Without government data for 1994--95, it
is difficult to know for certain if the total number of shotguns sold
corresponds to legal authorizations, although at face value the data
raises obvious questions. Bureaucratic differences in weapons
categorizations could explain this discrepancy.

#### Retail stores and gun shows outweigh government sales

**AFSC 16** (The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), Quaker
organization that promotes lasting peace with justice, as a practical
expression of faith in action. The AFSC delegation traveled in Mexico
from June 12 to 26, 2016. It was made up of 17 participants, primarily
from the United States, as well as from Mexico, Guatemala, and Israel.
The group included AFSC staff with long experience in issues of arms
transfers and immigration policy, as well as journalists, a
videographer, and other activists. We were supported in country by Casa
de los Amigos, Fray Matías Human Rights Center, and the Tlachinollan
Human Rights Center. This report was written by delegation participants,
with editorial assistance from WillieColón. "Where the Guns Go, U.S.
Arms and the Crisis of Violence in Mexico," November, 2016,
https://www.afsc.org/sites/default/files/documents/2016%20Where%20the%20Guns%20Go.pdf,
JKS + //Bennerz)

These [governmental sales do not count the assault rifles and other
firearms sold at retail stores and gun shows in the United States and
**smuggled into Mexico**]{.underline}. Paulina Arriaga, executive
director of Desarma Mexico (desarmamexico.org), told us that one can't
talk about arms in Mexico without talking about the United States. For
example, [the end of the assault weapons ban in 2004 provoked a spike in
the presence of such weapons in Mexico]{.underline}.19 [Seventy percent
of firearms seized in criminal investigations in Mexico come from the
U.S., according to the]{.underline} U.S. Bureau of
[A]{.underline}lcohol, [T]{.underline}obacco, and
[F]{.underline}irearms. In fact, Arriaga says [the U.S. is "without a
doubt the primary provider of legal and illegal arms in Mexico." Those
weapons contributed to some 65 percent of the nearly 15 million "common
crimes" committed in Mexico from 2011 to 2013, and roughly 56 percent of
the 57,000 homicides committed since 2013.]{.underline} Of the
U.S.-sourced guns seized by authorities at crime scenes in Mexico, up to
a half of them were imported into the United States from other nations,
according to a Violence Policy Center report. If the United States
restricted imports of assault weapons, it could reduce the flow of such
weapons to Mexico, even without a full U.S. legislative ban on the sale
of assault weapons.20

### Alt Cause- Other Countries

#### U.S. sales are a drop in the bucket

**AFSC 16** (The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), Quaker
organization that promotes lasting peace with justice, as a practical

from June 12 to 26, 2016. It was made up of 17 participants, primarily

JKS + //Bennerz)

While the United States has the biggest external role in Mexico's
militarization, [other countries also contribute to and benefit from it,
including Spain, the Netherlands, France, Canada, and
Germany.]{.underline} In the display showcases that we saw at the
Mexican Secretary of National Defense (SEDENA), [guns manufactured by
companies from the United States]{.underline},21 [Israel]{.underline},22
[Italy, Slovakia, China, and the Czech Republic are offered to private
security companies and federal, state, and local police forces shopping
for weapons]{.underline}. [German arms sales to Mexico demonstrate both
how exported arms are used in atrocities and how exporting states can
seek to exercise controls]{.underline}. The German firm [Heckler and
Koch sold nearly tenthousand]{.underline} G-36 assault
[rifles]{.underline} to Mexico between 2006 and 2009, [on the condition
that they not send them to the conflictive states]{.underline} of
Chihuahua, Guerrero, Jalisco, and Chiapas. [Yet dozens of the rifles
were recovered from the Iguala municipal police who participated in the
disappearance]{.underline} [of the 43 Ayotzinapa students]{.underline}
in September 2014. In response, German prosecutors charged six Heckler
and Koch employees with criminal violations, and German officials
visited Mexico to request forgiveness of family members of the
Ayotzinapa students.23

#### Other countries just fill in 

**Godnick et al '02** William Godnick with Robert Muggah and Camilla

[Manufacturers and brokers from North and South America, Europe, China,
and South Korea also export firearms to Central America]{.underline}.
[Spain appears to be an especially important supplier country for
firearms and ammunition]{.underline} (Godnick, 2001). Between 1994 and
1999, [El Salvador was the seventh largest importer of US-made revolvers
and pistols behind Mexico and ahead of South Africa]{.underline} (US
Department of Commerce, 2000). Equally worrying are the tens of
thousands of US exports categorized as sporting weapons destined
primarily for El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Socio-economic
conditions in Central America preclude the existence of a sufficiently
large leisure class who would purchase this quantity of weaponry solely
for hunting and sports shooting (US Department of Commerce, 2000). It is
more likely that these weapons are marketed as such, but used for
personal protection and/or by private security companies.

#### Most Mexican small arms don't come from the US 

**McMaken 18** (Ryan McMaken, is a senior editor at the Mises Institute.
Ryan has degrees in economics and political science from the University
of Colorado, and was the economist for the Colorado Division of Housing
from 2009 to 2014, "Stop Blaming Mexican Violence on American Guns,"
02/23/2018, Accessed 7.1.19,
<https://mises.org/wire/stop-blaming-mexican-violence-american-guns> )
//ZoL

Moreover, [the often-quoted statistic allegedly showing that as much as
70 percent, or even 90 percent, of guns seized in Mexico come from the
US is not true]{.underline}. That statistic is based only on seized guns
that are also traced by the ATF. How many of all guns seized in Mexico
come from the US? According to Stratfor, \"**[almost 90 percent of the
guns seized in Mexico in 2008 were not traced back to the United
States]{.underline}**.\" Nor does the Mexican government ask the ATF to
trace all guns seized in Mexico. This is because **[many of those arms
can be traced back to the Mexican government itself]{.underline}**.
After all, [it\'s not as if Latin America has no locally produced
firearms. The 2012 Small Arms Survey notes]{.underline}:

> [Latin America has a long tradition of gun production]{.underline},
> with some manufacturers tracing their history back many decades.
> Brazil has the largest arms industry in the region, followed by
> Argentina. [Firearms are also produced by private or government-owned
> industries]{.underline} in Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico,
> Paraguay, Peru, and Venezuela. [While most of the production is
> intended to equip the military and law enforcement institutions, some
> of the production is for **private use**]{.underline}.\"

[The report also refers to \"major exporters\" of small arms in
Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and Brazil]{.underline}. So we know **[Mexico
contains local arms-producing manufacturers to the point that some are
\"major exporters\" who also produce arms for government
institutions]{.underline}**. And **[government stockpiles are a source
for black markets as well]{.underline}**. Even worse, [the same
government institutions that work to keep firearms out of the hands of
peaceful private citizens, are often in league with **the
cartels**]{.underline}. As a recent New York Times article noted about
local resistance in Michoacan to cartel-sown chaos, \"[Townspeople
formed militias to eject both the cartel \... and the local police, who
were seen as complicit]{.underline}.\" In other words, **[there is often
no clear line between law enforcement and the cartels
themselves]{.underline}**. Often, [official law enforcement simply
can\'t be bothered]{.underline}. [Things are even worse
when]{.underline}, [as one cartel member put it]{.underline},
\"[soldiers and cops are \... really on our side]{.underline}.\" Thus,
it shouldn\'t exactly be a surprise that **[many of the guns seized in
Mexico are coming from official government sources]{.underline}**.

#### And, other countries sell to cartels

**Kuhn and Bunker 11** (David A. Kuhn, VTM Solutions. Robert J. Bunker,
Epochal Warfare Studies. "Just where do Mexican cartel weapons come
from?," Small Wars & Insurgencies, 22:5, 2011, JKS + //Bennerz)

In addition, [grenades originating from South Korea, Spain, Russia, and
Israel have also been turning up in the hands of the Mexican
cartels.]{.underline} [These hand grenades are modern]{.underline} -- in
many cases, new -- and of fragmentation design. The largest number of
hand grenades found in recent seizures is of the South Korean K 75 model
and can be traced back to lot numbers \[EC-85E605--031 and EC89E605--
073\]. There is also direct lot number evidence \[EC-89E605--063 et
al.\] that K 400 models that superseded the K 75 were also seized per
leaked SECRET//NOFORN US governmental cable \[09Monterrey100\].71 These
grenades are based on the US M-67 design and are virtually identical in
appearance and performance. Also in a 17 March 2009 photograph of a
seized weapons cache belonging to the Gulf Cartel, muzzle-launched rifle
grenades were visible. They have been identified as Swartklip HE/AP
(High Explosive/Anti-Personnel) grenades originating from South Africa.
As late as March of 2011, additional [South African rifle grenades have
turned up in cartel weapons seizures]{.underline}.72 Furthermore, in a
February 2011 STRATFOR document, [China has also been identified as
large source of military weapons flowing to the Mexican cartels:
Therefore, most of the military ordnance used by the Mexican cartels
comes from other sources, such as the international arms market --
increasingly from China via the same networks that furnish precursor
chemicals for narcotics manufacturing -- or from corrupt elements in the
Mexican military or even deserters who take their weapons with
them]{.underline} \... . As noted above, China has become an
increasingly common source for military weapons like grenades and fully
automatic assault rifles in recent years.73

### Alt Cause- Israel Surveillance

#### Alt cause---Israeli surveillance tech

**AFSC 16** (The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), Quaker

from June 12 to 26, 2016. It was made up of 17 participants, primarily

[Surveillance technology sales have been increasingly
lucrative]{.underline}. These sophisticated intelligence systems are
used not only by Mexican border control agents, but also by military and
police, most notably in the Control, Command, Communication Computer and
Intelligence public security system (called the C4I or C4). This system,
funded by the United States through Merida Initiative programs beginning
in 2010, allows all security agencies in Mexico, including municipal,
state, and federal police as well as the military, to access
surveillance information in real time. For example, the C4 system
allowed both local police and the Mexican military in Iguala, Guerrero
to follow the buses of the students from Ayotzinapa on the night that 43
were disappeared.24 Given the collusion between Mexican law enforcement
agencies and criminal organizations and direct violations by Mexican
state forces, these surveillance technologies may be used in human
rights violations by either criminal actors or state agents. Security
Tracking Devices sold \$355 million worth of surveillance equipment to
the Mexican military in 2011. Though the company has headquarters in
Mexico, it was also active in California, until the FBI arrested its
CEO, Jose Susumo Azano, in 2014. Mexico has also purchased long-range
AN/TPQ-78 radars produced by Northrop Grumman, a \$221 million
project.25 Israel's US\$4 million annual military export sales to Mexico
include small arms, but the exports are mostly surveillance equipment,
especially drones. [In 2004, the drone model Hermes 450, made by Israeli
arms manufacturer Elbit Systems, were the first unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) to patrol the skies above Mexico's southern border]{.underline}.
Another sale of these drones followed in 2011, and today three of the
five types of drones used for border control by the Mexican military are
made in Israel.26 In 2015, [Mexico ordered two Dominator 2 XP UAVs27
from Israeli company Aeronautics Limited. This drone, with the
capability to carry over 650 pounds and which can be converted into a
bomber, made its first successful test run in Mexico at the end of 2015.
The XP is now an **operational component** of the Mexican military for
intelligence missions]{.underline}. [Israel is involved in other Mexican
efforts to increase surveillance and control of the civilian
population]{.underline}. Today, **[the Israeli defense ministry is
working with the southeastern state of Chiapas to improve their C4
systems]{.underline}**.28 In 2006, an [Israeli technology firm, Verint
Systems, won a U.S. State Department contract for the wiretapping of
Mexican telecommunications]{.underline} in the service of the Mexican
government.29 By 2012, this system was able to collect all telephone
communications in the country and allow the Mexican government to access
them---all entirely funded by the United States.30

### Alt Cause- Loopholes

#### Gangs are already finding gun production loop holes in the status quo

**Godnick et al '02** William Godnick with Robert Muggah and Camilla
Waszink, Godnick is Policy Advisor for Latin America for International
Alert's Security and Peace-building Programme, "Stray Bullets: The
Impact of Small Arms Misuse in Central America", 03/02,
<http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.444.9822&rep=rep1&type=pdf>//kb

Despite high levels of arms availability in Central America, [some
individuals and groups have begun to make their own weapons. Youth
gangs, or maras, as they are generally referred to in Central America,
have been assembling makeshift pistols made out of bedsprings and metal
tubing]{.underline}. In Honduras, these makeshift weapons are known as
chimbas, while in El Salvador they are referred to as armas hechizas or
'home-made guns'. [These types of weapons make popular material for the
newspapers, and are often singled out by authorities as a problem
associated with youth gangs]{.underline}. Chimbas are the maras'
principal choice of weapon because they are inexpensive, easy to use,
and easy to discard. In Santa Ana, in the northern part of El Salvador,
makeshift workshops pump out imitations of .22- and .38-calibre and 9mm
pistols known as tacos. [Between January and August 2000, more than 200
of these weapons were confiscated by the police in Santa
Ana]{.underline} (El Mundo, 2000). Small-scale clandestine workshops are
being uncovered throughout the country. While these weapons---often
using parts and material from other weapons as components---are probably
more expensive than [chimbas, they are still cheap, easy to use, easily
disposed of, and difficult to trace by authorities. The already
excessive circulation of small arms in Central America appears to
exacerbate the need to produce even more weaponry for segments of
society that want, need, or perceive the need to acquire firepower at a
low cost.]{.underline}

### Alt Cause- Surpluses

#### Alt cause -- Cold war era surpluses are still in circulation across Central America

**UNODC 12** (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, is a United
Nations office that was established in 1997 as the Office for Drug
Control and Crime Prevention by combining the United Nations
International Drug Control Program and the Crime Prevention and Criminal
Justice Division in the United Nations Office at Vienna, "Transnational
Organized Crime in Central America and the Caribbean: A Threat
Assessment," Published Sep 28, 2012,
<https://www.refworld.org/pdfid/569f3aaa4.pdf> ) //ZoL

As has been well documented elsewhere, **[huge numbers of firearms were
imported and disseminated within Central America during the three civil
wars]{.underline}**: [Guatemala]{.underline} (1960- 1996), [El
Salvador]{.underline} (1980-1992), [and Nicaragua]{.underline} (1972-
1991). Most of **[these were provided by Cold War allies, and were
provided to both the states and rebel groups]{.underline}**. In the
latter case, [smuggling also established routes for moving weapons
around the region]{.underline}. Part of the counterinsurgency programmes
of these countries, particularly in Guatemala, involved the arming of
civil protection groups, so [these weapons were disseminated across a
broad area, and a relatively small number were ever
collected]{.underline}. **[Firearms are durable goods, and those that
were imported remained in circulation when the wars
ended]{.underline}**. [The modern assault rifle has not been
significantly improved since the Cold War, so there is no need for
updated technology]{.underline}. [In addition to leftover caches, the
militaries of the region were downsized radically under the peace
accords, so surplus abounds.]{.underline}

#### Weapons stockpiles in Central America make it inevitable

**Kuhn and Bunker 11** (David A. Kuhn, VTM Solutions. Robert J. Bunker,
Epochal Warfare Studies. "Just where do Mexican cartel weapons come
from?," Small Wars & Insurgencies, 22:5, 2011, JKS + //Bennerz)

Central American arms connections [A plethora of military small arms,
light support weapons, and military standoff weapons exist due to the
intense conflicts that once took place throughout the Central American
region]{.underline}. **[Large caches of these weapons have now found
their way into the hands of the Mexican cartels]{.underline}** operating
in both Mexico and throughout Central America. A CONFIDENTIAL US Embassy
in Mexico cable \[09Mexico880\] in March 2009 estimated that ' \...
**[at least 90 percent of military origin weapons]{.underline}** (such
as grenades and light anti-tank weapons) **[are traced to Central
American military stockpiles]{.underline}**.'52 One example of these
assault weapons is the H&K G-3 rifle (7.62 £ 51 mm NATO/.308 cal) and
some Belgium FN FAL rifles also in 7.62 £ 51 mm which are currently in
the cartel inventories. These latter two rifles would also have select
fire capability and were likely obtained from weapons caches in Central
America where they were originally involved in the El Salvador conflict
over a decade prior. [The cartels are also obtaining hand grenades from
legacy munitions stores from this conflict. Many of the Mexican
government's 5,800 fragmentation grenade seizures between 2007 and 2010
can be traced back to these stores.53]{.underline}

### Alt Cause- Big Weapons! 

#### Drug traffickers don't care about the aff's small arms

**Parakilas 13** (Jacob Parakilas, Deputy Head, US and the Americas
Programme of Chatham House. Before joining Chatham House, Jacob worked

The weapons of choice [Of primary interest to drug traffickers
are]{.underline} the so-called **[assault weapons]{.underline}**. [These
rifles are effectively identical to the standard arms of infantry
soldiers the world over]{.underline}, lacking only the provision for
automatic or burst fire. Most modern assault weapons fire intermediate
cartridges with effective ranges of 300 yards or more, and can be
equipped with magazines holding between 30 and 100 rounds, allowing
extended fire without reloading -- a massive tactical advantage.
**[Other favoured weapons for Mexican drug trafficking organisations
include large-calibre sniper rifles and anti-materiel
rifles]{.underline}**, particularly the .50 calibre Barrett models,
[which are reputedly capable of destroying a car's engine block with a
single shot from a mile away]{.underline}. [Semi-automatic personal
defence weapons]{.underline} (the civilian versions of submachine guns
such as the Heckler and Koch UMP and FN P90) [are also frequently
recovered by Mexican security forces]{.underline}, [along with a wide
range of shotguns and semi-automatic pistols]{.underline}. The cost of
acquiring such weapons are negligible for trafficking groups whose
profits are estimated in the billions of dollars: variants of the AR-15
rifle (the civilian version of the U.S. military's M-16) can be bought
brand new for a little over \$1000, pistols and shotguns for a few
hundred dollars, and the hugely powerful Barrett M82 for about \$10,000.
Even factoring in the labour cost of the straw purchaser (an individual
with a clean criminal record who legally purchases the weapons at an
American firearms dealer), the cost of procuring ammunition and the cost
of moving the weapons across the border, the advantages to traffickers
are considerable.

### Arms =/= RC of Problems

#### The aff fails -- demand for firearms will inevitably cause fill-in

The US gun market in perspective

[The ease of access among Mexican]{.underline} (not to mention US)
[cartels to firearms]{.underline}, particularly high-powered rifles, [is
extremely troubling]{.underline} and has prompted the Mexican government
and civil society to call for better controls. At the same time,
[an**alysts and policy-makers should not exaggerate the importance of**
supply-side **US gun control measures on** Mexican **cartel
violence**]{.underline}. [The US gun market existed for decades before
the current explosion of violence; **it was** thus **probably not the
primary trigger. Nor would limiting US inflows alone necessarily reduce
the violence by any meaningful degree.**]{.underline} T[he cases of
Brazil and Colombia suggest that **when traffickers demand firearms,
supply arises from somewhere to fill it**. T]{.underline}he explosion of
Mexican drug violence is generating intense demand for firearms by
groups with enormous cash flows and close contact with corrupt officials
in Mexico and suppliers of illicit small arms in Central America and
overseas. This suggests that [a **key component** of any successful
violence-reduction strategy **must aim to reduce** cartels' **incentives
to employ armed violence,** thus minimizing demand for
firearms]{.underline} (Atwood, Glatz, and Muggah, 2006)

#### RC of Mexican crime is NOT guns -- The US has more guns, less regulation but also less crime

Why Are Rates So High? [Violent crime may be Mexico\'s largest problem
for its economy, growth, and its standard of]{.underline} living. In
recent decades, [Mexico has moved beyond single-party political
rule]{.underline}. [It]{.underline} now [has competitive elections in
more than name only]{.underline}. [It has several metropolitan areas
which are --- outside of the crime issue --- considered good places to
do business]{.underline}. [It is increasingly connected to the global
economy]{.underline}. The UN ranks it \"high\" on its Human Development
Index. Along with other rapidly modernizing Latin American Countries
like Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, and Panama, it would be very wrong to
call Mexico a \"third world\" country. **[So why the persistent violent
crime]{.underline}**? [This is one of those issues that has no simple
answer]{.underline}. Part of the problem is due to a lack of local
control. Some is due to the Drug War --- as is the case in the US and
other countries. Part is due to demographics. [This doesn\'t stop some
commentators]{.underline}, though, [from attempting to assign easy
explanations to the problem]{.underline}. **[One such recent trend in
polemics is found among gun-control advocates who attempt to blame
Mexico\'s crime woes on the availability of small arms in the United
States.]{.underline}** This blame game results in part from the fact
that Mexico is not exactly laissez faire when it comes to firearms. As
Vox notes:

> [Mexico maintains]{.underline} some fairly [strict gun
> laws]{.underline}: [All guns must be registered through the federal
> government, carrying a gun requires a license, sales are legally
> limited to one store]{.underline} in Mexico City, [and carrying
> licenses can be taken away at the federal government\'s
> discretion.]{.underline}

Like much of Latin America, [Mexico is a country with strict gun laws,
but high homicide rates]{.underline}. So [how to explain the
problem]{.underline}? Well, in the case of Mexico, [the answer for gun
control activists is to blame the United States: \"one way for Mexicans
to get around their country\'s strict gun laws is to simply walk across
the border]{.underline}.\" The logic proceeds accordingly: The presence
of more guns means more homicide. And, although Mexico has strict gun
laws, Mexico is unfortunately located close to the United States where
guns can be easily purchased. Guns are then introduced into Mexico where
they drive a higher homicide rate. [There are some problems with this
logic]{.underline}. **[Even if we account for all the black-market guns
in Mexico, gun totals are still much higher in the US]{.underline}**.
That is, [according to the 2007 Small Arms Survey, it is estimated that
there are around 15 million privately-held guns in Mexico]{.underline},
on the high end. [Even accounting for an additional increase since 2007,
we\'re looking at a rate of fewer than 20 guns per 100 people in
Mexico]{.underline}. **[In the United States]{.underline}**, on the
other hand, **[that total is around 100 guns per 100
people]{.underline}**. So, [if one is going to pin Mexico\'s violence
problem on \"more guns,\" they have to account for why there
are]{.underline} more than [five times as many guns in the US, with only
a small fraction of the homicides]{.underline}.

#### Similar US states have more guns and less homicides

**McMaken 18** (Ryan McMaken, is a senior editor at the Mises Institute.

//ZoL

[It requires]{.underline} quite a bit of [creativity to then take these
facts and twist them into a narrative which concludes \"too many guns in
Texas leads to more Mexican homicide]{.underline}.\" [If Texan guns are
fueling homicide in neighboring jurisdictions, why aren\'t US states
close to Texas experiencing similar problems]{.underline}? [New
Mexico]{.underline}, after all, [is next to Texas. But New Mexico\'s
homicide rate of 6.7 per 100,000 is a mere fraction of its neighbor to
the south]{.underline} --- [Chihuahua state]{.underline} --- [where the
homicide rate is over 40 per 100,000]{.underline}. **[Chihuahua is also
next to Texas]{.underline}**. Moreover, [increases in gun totals over
time in the United States have not shown increases in
homicides]{.underline}. In fact, the opposite is true. According to
statistics from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, [new guns
manufactured in the United States]{.underline}, since 2011, [have been
more than double what they were throughout most of the past thirty
years]{.underline}. [Total gun production rapidly increased from 2001 to
2013, yet, homicide rates were cut in half from the 1990s to
today]{.underline}. Although [homicide rates]{.underline} have trended
up in the past two years, they **[remain near 50-year
lows]{.underline}**. Indeed, [some American border towns have
persistently low homicide rates, even by American
standards]{.underline}. The homicide rate in El Paso, Texas, for
example, was a very low 2.7 per 100,000 in 2016. Just across the Rio
Grande, the city of Juarez is one of the murder capitals of the world.
Moreover, 80 percent of El Paso residents are of Hispanic --- primarily
Mexican --- origin, meaning we can\'t even resort to a bigoted
explanation about how Mexican ethnicity leads to more violence.

### Circumvention- Different Country Laws

) //ZoL

[In the past decade]{.underline} (2005-2015) [Central American countries
have added new regulations to the existing arm control
laws]{.underline}, [in order to confront the traffic on arms and
ammunitions]{.underline} within the region, [and therefore the
insecurity and violence that this traffic is fueling]{.underline}.
**[However, some of the countries are still more permissive than others,
representing an obstacle to the international effort to defy arms
trafficking in the region]{.underline}**. For example, **[in the
Northern Triangle region]{.underline}** of Honduras, El Salvador and
Guatemala, known, [divergences in gun control laws could affect the
propagation of firearms trafficking within the region]{.underline}.
While Guatemala and El Salvador gun control laws are considered
restrictive, [Honduran gun control law is considered permissive,
therefore guns are more likely to be acquired in the latter, and then
smuggled to the former countries with more restrictive
regulations.]{.underline} According to the Gun Policy portal, the
distinction of a permissive and a restrictive gun control law is related
to the possibilities of a civilian acquiring one or more firearms. In
this case, "possibilities" are specifically linked to the licensing
requirements. So, for example, [in Honduras the license to acquire a
firearm also covers the potential possession, selling and transferring
of the firearm]{.underline}, [while in Guatemala and El Salvador
different licenses are required for each activity]{.underline}. In fact,
in Salvador there are six types of licenses: (i) to acquire, own and use
a weapon, (ii) to repair a weapon, (iii) to load ammunition, (iv) to use
explosives with industrial purposes and civil works, (v) to manufacture
pyrotechnical products and (iv) to commercialize weapons and
pyrotechnical products. Also, there are three types of registration: (i)
to own and transport, (ii) to carry and (iii) to collect. [Another
aspect related to the permissiveness or restrictiveness of a control law
gun is the specific requirement to acquire the basic license to own and
carry a firearm]{.underline}. [In Honduras]{.underline}, for instance,
[the requirements include solely having an adult age (18) and a
background check]{.underline} (usually criminal). [The license is active
for four years and an authorized civilian can acquire until five
weapons]{.underline}. [The punishment for carrying a firearm without
license, or with an invalid license, does not include a criminal
conviction, just the seizure of the gun or guns, and a
fine.]{.underline} **[In El Salvador and Guatemala, on the other hand,
requirements are stricter]{.underline}**. The background check to
acquire the license in both countries includes not only the criminal
record screening, but also a certificate on the mental and health
records of the civilian. Also, a theoretical and training course in the
use of firearms in a certificated institution is demanded. The legal age
to apply for the license is 21 to own a firearm, and 25 to carry one. In
Guatemala it is also required to apply for the license, which is a
letter explaining the reasons to need a weapon. In the case of personal
security reasons, the approval of the government is also required. The
punishment for carrying a firearm without authorization in El Salvador
is the suspension of the license and a fine, while in Guatemala a
punishment includes a criminal conviction of even 8 to 10 years in
prison.

### Circumvention- Trump Rules

#### Trump circumvents -- he's changing export rules to boost sales

**Abramson 19** (Jeff Abramson, non-resident senior fellow for arms
control and conventional arms transfers at the Arms Control Association,
2-8-2019, \"Congress Has Opportunity to Halt Dangerous Firearms Export
Changes,\" Arms Control Association,
<https://www.armscontrol.org/pressroom/2019-02/congress-opportunity-halt-dangerous-firearms-export-changes)//ICH-EC>

The [Trump administration will soon publish final rules that
would]{.underline} likely [expedite how certain firearms and
military-style weapons are sold internationally. Congress can and should
seek to block these changes]{.underline}, which exacerbate the export of
U.S. gun violence problems abroad. On Monday, mildly revised versions of
rules first released for comment in May were presented to Congress,
starting a 30-day review period. Specifically, [the proposed rules
relate to the first three categories of the United States Munitions
List]{.underline} (USML) [maintained under the International Traffic in
Arms Regulations]{.underline} (ITAR), whose lead administrator is the
Department of State. [Under the new rules, nonautomatic and
semi-automatic firearms and their ammunition currently controlled under
the USML would move to the Commerce Control List]{.underline} (CCL) [to
become part of the Export Administration Regulations]{.underline} (EAR),
[whose lead administrator is the Commerce Department.]{.underline} Under
the new rules, [Congress would lose its ability to provide
oversight]{.underline} on many firearms sales. In 2002, Congress amended
notifications requirements so it would be informed of potential
commercial sales of firearms under USML category I when they were valued
at just \$1 million, but [no]{.underline} such [notifications exist for
items on the CCL.]{.underline} In recent years, Congressional
involvement has helped forestall firearms transfers to repressive forces
in Turkey and the Philippines. At the core of these proposed changes is
the mistaken belief that [firearms]{.underline} do not merit tighter
control because they are neither high-tech nor provide unique military
advantages. In reality, they [are some of the weapons most often used to
commit abuses and extend conflict]{.underline} around the world. These
weapons, used in the mass shootings at Sandy Hook, the Pulse nightclub,
Las Vegas, and Parkland, are not the commodities that the United States
should make easier to export. [Exported and trafficked into Mexico and
Central America, for example, U.S.-]{.underline}origin [small arms
are]{.underline} already [falling into the hands of human rights abusers
and criminal organizations.]{.underline} In 2017, the administration
notified Congress of more than [\$660
million](https://securityassistance.org/fact_sheet/us-proposed-firearms-sales-2017)
of proposed firearms sales regulated under the USML, according to the
Security Assistance Monitor. The value of transfers that would be
subject to the new rule is not yet clear as that data cannot be fully
disaggregated. A bill introduced Friday by Representative Norma Torres
(D-Calif.) and co-sponsored by House Foreign Affairs Chair Elliot Engel
(D-N.Y.) and others would simply prohibit the changes. [If not halted or
significantly changed, the new rules would continue the cynical approach
of the Trump administration to treat weapons as any other trade
commodity, threatening to undermine long-term global security and
upsetting decades of more responsible U.S. arms transfer
policy.]{.underline}

## \*\*ATT Counterplan\*\*

### 1NC- CP

#### Text: The United States federal government should ratify the Arms Trade Treaty.

#### The CP solves gun violence in Mexico -- ratification ensures compliance with ATT Articles 6 and 7

**Ilarraza 17 --** (Diana Escalante, MA from American University, former
law clerk at the Department of State, \"U.S. Arms Exports in the Mexican
War on Drugs: A Violation of the Arms Trade Treaty,\" American
University Journal of Gender, Social Policy & the Law,

// S.Y.

On March 28, 2011, Javier Sicilia, a Mexican poet, and activist, woke up
to the news that his 24-year-old son was found dead in a vehicle along
with six other people in the Mexican state of Morelos.\[2\] In 2013, he
began a campaign to call attention to the detrimental effects of the
arms sales from the United States to Mexico.\[3\] Sicilia, along with
[many]{.underline} other [activists, believe]{.underline}s that [the
National Rifle Association abuses the privilege of the Second Amendment
when it promotes the sale of weapons to Mexico]{.underline}.\[4\]

[Sicilia's theory coincides with the findings of the U.S. Government
Accountability Office (GAO),]{.underline} which found that approximately
[eighty-seven percent of firearms seized by Mexican authorities in
reported crimes come from the United States.\[]{.underline}5\] In
exporting weapons to Mexico, [the United States is arming Mexican law
enforcement officials who collude with organized criminal
groups.\[]{.underline}6\] [Thirty-two percent of U.S. arms exports to
Mexico are mysteriously unaccounted for by the Mexican
government]{.underline}, yet [**the U.S. Department of State continues
to allow direct commercial sales and foreign military sales** of weapons
to any state or region of Mexico]{.underline}.\[7\] Given that arms
exports to Mexico are unlikely to cease, is there legal recourse to
pressure the United States to better control the arms it exports to
Mexico?

**[The United States' current gun exports to Mexico violate the Arms
Trade Treaty (ATT]{.underline}**), a multilateral treaty that regulates
international trade in firearms [**because the arms exports are aiding
in crimes against humanity in Mexico**, and they are being diverted to
organized criminal groups]{.underline}.\[8\] In 2013, President Obama
signed the ATT despite strong opposition from U.S. gun lobbyists who
maintain that the treaty infringes upon U.S. sovereignty.\[9\] [Article
6 prohibits arms exports to countries that use arms in crimes against
humanity, while Article 7 prohibits arms exports to countries where the
arms could undermine peace and security]{.underline}.\[10\] [The U.S.
violates Article 6 of the ATT because it has constructive knowledge that
the arms it exports to Mexico are being used in crimes against
humanity]{.underline}.\[11\] [The U.S. is also violating Article 7 of
the ATT, because it is undermining peace and stability in Mexico by
indiscriminately arming Mexican authorities despite multiple reports of
extra-judicial armed violence and the problem of lost weapons in Mexican
police units]{.underline}.\[12\]

The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court defines crimes
against humanity as a widespread or systematic attack directed against
any civilian population, which may include murder, extermination,
persecution on political grounds, forced disappearance of persons,
enforced prostitution, or other inhumane acts that harm mental health or
human dignity.\[13\] [Although the mass atrocities in Mexico's war on
drugs are not formally recognized as crimes against humanity, there is a
strong movement to recognize the violence perpetrated in Mexico as
such]{.underline}, particularly as the violence mirrors the necessary
elements of crimes against humanity under international law.\[14\]

The committed in Mexico are rarely prosecuted, but a few well-documented
events shed light on the danger of arming Mexican law enforcement
officials who are accused of colluding with organized criminal groups.
In one of Mexico's most egregious public safety violations, forty-three
student protestors in the town of Ayotzinapa, were allegedly kidnapped
by policemen and turned over the Guerreros Unidos Cartel, who
incinerated the students, and disposed of their remains in a nearby
river.\[15\] In another Mexican case, Atenco, President Enrique Peña
Nieto, who was governor at the time, instructed local police to put down
a farmers' protest at the local airport.\[16\] The armed forces
wrongfully detained 145 protestors, and thirty-one of the detained women
reported that they experienced sexual assault or rape at the hands of
the police.\[17\] Lastly, in Arzate Meléndez, Mexican law enforcement
officials drew widespread attention from the international human rights
community when an investigation revealed that a Mexican troop wrongfully
detained and tortured a civilian into confessing to a massacre; the
court found that the soldiers committed egregious human rights abuses,
but the troop was not prosecuted.\[18\] Given that ninety-eight percent
of crimes in Mexico do not get prosecuted, the inconclusive result of
these cases is common under the Mexican justice system.\[19\]

[If the U.S. continues indiscriminately exporting arms to Mexico despite
the on-going violence, Articles 6 and 7 of the ATT are undermined, and
so is the safety of civilians on both sides of the border. **Now is the
time to** put **pressure** on **the United States** **to seriously
consider the Arms Trade Treaty**, and better protect the interests of
innocent civilians south of the border.]{.underline}

### 1NC- Heg Net Benefit

#### The CP is key to maintaining US heg -- allies see the US as bogged down with domestic political forces

**Chelseth et al 14 --** (Adam Chelseth, Filza Nasir, John Steies, and
Patrick Lobejko; graduate students from the Hubert H. Humphrey School of
Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota--Twin Cities; "United
States on the Road to Isolation: The Cost of Non-Ratification," Humphrey
School of Public Affairs) // S.Y.

Global Leadership Costs

The ATT has taken nearly two decades to be molded into the mature piece
of global arms trade regulation that it is today. Careful consideration
has been paid throughout this process to voices of support as well as
voices of opposition. [The United States, being the world\'s largest
arms exporter, has had an unquestionably important role in the formation
of this document and has made the decision to sign the ATT]{.underline}.
However, despite our inclusion in the negotiation process and as the
treaty nears the all-important number of fifty ratifications, which
would bring the treaty into force, [the U.S. stands on the sidelines in
terms of actually ratifying the document. As our allies look to us to
assume leadership of another critical global regulatory mechanism, the
United States has yet to step forward]{.underline} Jeff Abramson,
currently of Landmine & Cluster Munition Monitor and formerly of Control
Arms, underscores this point by saying that [while the treaty will move
forward without U.S ratification, \"\[**t\]he U.S. still loses
international leadership and moral credit\" for not ratifying the ATT**
along with many of our allies]{.underline}.10 While it is difficult to
quantify moral credit, this point speaks to the fact that the [U.S. in
not ratifying will place themselves in a group with North Korea, Iran,
and Syria, rather than joining our allies such as Germany, France, and
the United Kingdom in ratification]{.underline}. Nonetheless, there are
some advantages to the U.S.\' current position. By participating in the
negotiation process and signing the ATT, the U.S. was able to include
within it virtually all its favored global norms and protect its
national security interests. Internally, pro-ATT members of the current
administration likely look at this as a best case scenario: the ATT is
rooted deeply in American values on this issue, the treaty is headed for
entry into force, and the administratiorn suffers little to no
consequences on the domestic political front by not actually ratifying
it. [However, the costs of non-ratification are still significant going
forward. If the world begins to see the **U.S. as completely hamstrung
by domestic political forces**, the **leadership** the international
community expects from America **could** slowly
**deteriorate**]{.underline}. [If the U.S. is unwilling to put its
official stamp of approval on a treaty aimed at positively contributing
to collective global security and human rights, then it runs the risk of
inviting the international community to move forward on other sensitive
issues without that leadership in the future]{.underline}. The U.S.
being side- stepped in future negotiations [would be a sizeable blow to
its global leadership and could result in the adoption of treaties with
norms contrary to U.S. interests. Arguments against
ratification]{.underline} consistently include the point that the United
States has already done what is necessary to protect its vital interests
in the ATT, such as mandatory implementation of national export and
import control systems and transparent government records on arms
transfers. However, this contention is [problematic]{.underline}. As
soon as the fiftieth nation ratifies the treaty, the ATT will enter into
force, and the Conference of States Parties must convene within a year
afterward.\" Critical outcomes regarding the enforcement mechanism,
possible amendments, and financial decisionswil be decided at this point
and as of now, only those who have ratified stand to be included in this
process. The U.S. is currently lobbying for inclusion in the Conference
of States Parties even if it does not ratify, but no decision has beern
made given the precedent that would set. Understandably there is
hesitation by those who have already ratified to allow the U.S. this
opportunity, as it would remove any existing incentive for ratification.
[Any reservations amongst our allies regarding the possible skirting of
institutional norms and multilateral relations by the United States
could only be further enhanced by this move As previously stated, global
leadership can be difficult to quantify. But one potential method would
be to look at the type of role a given State plays in finding a solution
to a perceived problem in relation to its contribution to what is trying
to be solved]{.underline}. Although the United States does not
intentionally contribute to the illicit arms trade and already follows
all of the guidelines of the ATT, [the U.S.\' role as the world\'s
largest arms dealer requires a commensurate effort in terms of
leadership and promotion of global norms to achieve collective security
on this issue]{.underline}. While [failure to ratify]{.underline} has
not derailed the treaty, it is impossible to ignore the absence of the
United States and it inevitably makes the treaty itself less robust and
[lessens pressure on other nations to join]{.underline}. Heather
Hurlburt, former Executive Director of the National Security Network,
emphasizes this point by noting that international relations can be seen
as a \"giant set of trades,\" and that given the importance of the ATT
to other countries, [the U.S. failure to ratify could return to haunt us
when another issue more important to U.S. interests is raised at the
UN.]{.underline} Furthermore, [**Hurlburt** notes the dependence of U.S.
interests on international norms and the observation of those norms, and
**likens ATT to a bargaining chip the U.S. would be forfeiting** for
having but not ultimately ratifying the treaty]{.underline}.1 Given the
global direction toward more regional and international institutions
that focus on a multilateral approach to governance and regulation,
**[failure of the world\'s lone superpower to ratify such a treaty
damages its credibility, political authority, and prospects for future
leadership.]{.underline}**

### Solvency- Human Rights

#### The CP solves human rights abuses -- US ratification is key to strengthen UN credibility and multilateralism

// S.Y.

The adoption of the ATT was widely praised, and rightly so. Following
the adoption of the ATT, the U.N. issued a press release stating:

"To a burst of sustained applause, the General Assembly today voted
overwhelmingly in favour of a "historic", first-ever treaty to regulate
the astonishing number of conventional weapons traded each year, making
it more difficult for them to be diverted into the hands of those intent
on sowing the seeds of war and conflict."

The President of the Final UN Conference, Amb. Woolcott, wrote:

"[The UN had not seen success in negotiating a multilateral arms control
agreement since the 1990s. The adoption of the Treaty by an overwhelming
majority of States in the UN General Assembly is a major achievement for
the United Nations and for multilateralism.]{.underline} When the
Treaty's regular Conference of States Parties takes hold, it will
underscore that the discussion and scrutiny of the international arms
trade have firmly found a place on the multilateral agenda."
(Introduction to the book Weapons and international law: The Arms Trade
Treaty, 2015)

Finally, In the preface to the book Le Traite sur le Commerce des Armes
by Loïc Simonet, Dr. Óscar Arias wrote:

"...I am both proud and deeply relieved that as I write these words in
October 2014, we have defied the odds. We have made history. [The Arms
Trade Treaty was adopted on 2nd April 2013 by a large majority of the UN
General Assembly]{.underline}. (...) As we look back on our history of
violence, [we took a powerful step towards peace]{.underline}. For the
first time in history, [a legally binding instrument established a
common regulatory framework for international transfers of conventional
arms, and therefore set up universal legal standards for the arms trade,
on one of the few areas of global commerce which had escaped any control
until now. **The treaty has the power to reduce human suffering and
contribute to international peace, security and
stability**]{.underline}. To be honest, it is an achievement I never
expected to witness. I never thought that an idea that first took shape
so many years ago would become a part of international law in my
lifetime."

Given the great difficulties it encompassed as well as the great real
impact it can have on the ground in reducing human suffering, [the
adoption of the ATT was indeed a historical achievement of the
international community. **It also reaffirmed the relevance of the
United Nations and multilateral diplomacy**, in particular in an area as
controversial as the regulation of conventional arms,]{.underline} and
in which no progress had been registered for so many years.

According to Amnesty International, [more than 500 people die every day
from gun violence, 44 percent of all killings globally involve gun
violence, and there were over 1 million firearm-related deaths globally
between 2012 and 2016.]{.underline} In contrast, military expenditure is
on the rise. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute (SIPRI), [the U.S. continues to be the top global exporter of
arms and the 13th global importer]{.underline} (with Saudi Arabia
holding the first position), with a total military expenditure in 2018
of \$6.5 billion. This is more than 120 times the U.N. budget for the
period 2018-2019.

[It is for these reasons that **the recent announcement to "revoke" the
U.S. signature of the ATT is so troubling**. The world is in dire need
of an effective implementation of the only global legally binding
instrument that regulates the international trade in arms. And for that
to happen, **it is key to have on board the largest exporter in the
world**, if not as a State Party, at least a**s a responsible actor
committed not to undermine the** object and **purpose of the
treaty**,]{.underline} which has at its core international peace and
security and, most importantly, the value of the human person.
Unfortunately, this political decision, based on false premises, and
coupled with a consistent pattern of attacks on multilateral diplomacy,
seems anything but promising.

### Solvency- Leadership/signaling

#### The CP is key to US national security and global leadership -- US ratification spurs other countries to follow

**Chelseth et al 14 --** (Adam Chelseth, Filza Nasir, John Steies, and
Patrick Lobejko; graduate students from the Hubert H. Humphrey School of
Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota--Twin Cities; "United
States on the Road to Isolation: The Cost of Non-Ratification," Humphrey
School of Public Affairs) // S.Y.

National Security Costs

[One important issue surrounding non-ratification of the ATT is that of
the potential costs to U.S. national security]{.underline}. The ATT
builds off of earlier efforts, such as the PoA, and sees some provisions
of the treaty apply to ammunitions as well as the parts and components
of these weapons. Further, [the ATT is legally binding, and applies to
state-to-state transfers of arms]{.underline} [Given these new
realities, this treaty will better serve nations around the world
looking to regulate the illicit trade in arms]{.underline}. \"Half of
the countries in the world don\'t have national rules or guidelines
regarding which arms imports and exports to approve or disapprove,\"
said Daryl Kimball, Executive Director at the Arms Control Association.
[With the U.S.\' propensity to assist in a variety of capacities in
violent trouble spots around the world, **the** illicit **movement and
acquisition of arms** anywhere **can be viewed as** well **within U.S.
national security interests**]{.underline} More than anything else, the
ATT regulates the export of weapons. [With the U.S. currently holding
the distinction of being the world\'s largest arms exporter, it is in
its best interests to accurately identify and track exactly where its
weapons exports are going]{.underline}. The U.S. has long since
understood the importance of this issue, which is why they have had
domestic measures to meet this goal\--such as restrictions on
re-transfer of arms sold abroad and end-user checks\--in place for some
time. [The \"boomerang effect,\" where **weapons produced in the U.S.
end up being used against U.S. personnel on the ground, is an important
part of the national security side** of this debate]{.underline} Barbara
Frey, Director of the Human Rights Program at the University of
Minnesota and former Special Rapporteur to the UN Sub-Commission on the
issue of preventing human rights abuses committed with small arms,
further points out that the latest estimates suggest there are currently
650 million firearms in civilian possession, including 2-10 million in
the hands of gangs, and 1.1-1.8 million more in the possession of
non-state armed groups. \"It really matters what governments do with
their weapons,\" says Frey. [Accordingly, the emphasis the ATT places on
cooperation between nations who have ratified the treaty will help
eliminate gray areas that arise from export destinations that may
present risk. The ATT calls for **information sharing** on things like
international trafficking routes, illicit brokers, and methods of
concealment.]{.underline}\' In ratifying the ATT and solidifying this
commitment for the international community, [**the U.S. would** not only
**increase the group\'s capacity to collect** this important
**information**, but **also strengthen its own argument and** ability to
**draw other hesitant nations such as China and Russia into compliance**
with the treaty]{.underline}. With today\'s ever-changing geopolitical
situation, [**the flow of arms from China** to Pakistan]{.underline}
(accounting for 55% of Chinese arms exports), [Myanmar, or Venezuela is
something that, **if left unregulated** by an international mechanism,
**represents a real cost to U.S. national security**.]{.underline}8
[Without ratifying the document itself, the U.S. will fall short in its
argument with fellow large-scale arms export]{.underline} States whose
interests do not always align with its own. The transparency provided by
mandatory national records on arms exports, stipulated in Article 12 of
the ATT, is an invaluable asset to the international community,
requiring those who join the treaty to take responsibility for arms
leaving their territory.9 Globalization has changed the way the world
interacts and conducts exchange. In particular, the developing States\'
interactions and exchanges with developed States have been slow or
resistant to regulation largely due to rampant corruption in the
developing world. [The U.S. has set the gold standard when it comes to
keeping and reporting export data with or without the ATT, but **there
are many nations** around the world who do not do so, nations **that
won\'t even discuss joining the treaty until movement** on the issue
**is seen from the United States.**]{.underline} [If the U.S. joins and
strengthens the regulatory group that will emerge when the treaty comes
into force, then the opportunity to help quell violence in a variety of
hot spots around the world, from the Middle East to Central Africa,
increases significantly]{.underline}. The reality is that today [there
can be no global norm without the participation of the U.S. and the
legitimacy that comes with that participation. U.S. ratification will
not attract every country in the world, but there will undoubtedly be a
domino effect and the strength of this treaty comes from the
transparency these States then must provide on their arms
sales]{.underline}. If the U.S is looking to maintain its ability to
oversee and appropriately punish countries for illicit activity through
international institutions such as the UN, it cannotturn its back on one
of the mechanisms it helped this body create to regulate such activity.
The ATT is not unique as a treaty with arms control goals that the
United States has not ratified For example, the domestic political fight
over ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), another
treaty with broad global support, is still being fought in the U.S
However, a better example of the world coming together to create an
international mechanism already paving dividends is the Chemical Weapons
Convention (CWC). Since its inception in April 1997, the norms created
by the CWC have led to a marked decrease in the production and
proliferation of chemical weapons around the world, including the
ongoing removal of chemical weapons from Syria. The outcome and goals of
the CWC are different from the basic regulation of arms sales that the
ATT seeks, but it nonetheless is an example of the international
community, including full participation of and ratification by the
United States, working collaboratively to create a mechanism and
universal norms by which States around the world operate to increase
collective security. These types of victories for that collective
security can undoubtedly be placed in the \"pro\" section of the ATT
debate

Counselling can easily make a person vulnerable to the allegation of
conceit but this author, most humbly, must bring this to the attention
of President Obama: Please [do not make the implementation
of]{.underline} your nuclear disarmament [efforts contingent upon any
other country\'s]{.underline} or its leader\'s [behaviour. **Iran, North
Korea, Pakistan, India or Israel will see sense** in saving money being
spent on atom bombs, and diverting it to the welfare of their citizens
for alleviation of poverty and disease, **once they see the actions of
America** and other nuclear powers to produce genuine
disarmament]{.underline}. Nations led by persons with little concern for
the human welfare should not wrong foot a man of overwhelming candour
like the current President of the US. The breakage of the invidious link
between their possession of nuclear weapons and feeling safe from any
external invasion will he essential, as it is a key to disarmament,
according to a seasoned activist in the field of disarmament, Dr Mohamed
El-Baradei. After the conference of 13 April 2010 in Washington, [by
organising the 2-day summit in March 2012 in Seoul, South
Korea]{.underline}, (with 7 more participants), the [Obama]{.underline}
regime [has given manifest credibility to its desire to see \"the world
without nuclear weapons]{.underline}.\" (103) The Communiqu6 of the
Seoul biennial conference recognised that \"Nuclear terrorism continues
to be one of the most challenging threats to international security and
said, \"[We, the leaders, gathered in Seoul on March 26- 27, 2012, renew
the political commitments generated from the 2010 Washington Nuclear
Security Summit to work toward strengthening nuclear security, reducing
the threat of nuclear terrorism, and preventing terrorists, criminals,
or other unauthorized actors from acquiring nuclear
materials.\"]{.underline} (104) [We cannot afford to be pessimistic when
the leader of the only superpower of the world is saying \"Let us reach
for the world that ought to be - that spark of the divine that still
stirs within each of our souls.\"]{.underline} President Obama had
declared this after quoting the celebrated speech of Dr Martin Luther
King Jr, \"I refuse to accept despair as the final response to the
ambiguities of history. I refuse to accept the idea that the \'isness\'
of man\'s present condition makes him morally incapable of reaching up
for the eternal \'oughtness\' that forever confronts him.\" (105) The
task in front of president Obama is not easy one. Like any good realist,
he knows the might of the evil. Recognising its existence, he has said
in his noble address of 10 December 2009, \"To say that force may
sometimes be necessary is not a call to cynicism - it is recognition of
history; the imperfections of man and the limits of "reason." (105)
[Today, America can lead disarmament efforts from the position of
strength. In addition to the inspiration of Presidents, Kennedy and
Reagan, the Eisenhower spirit has to return and guide those who wish to
strive for genuine disarmament.]{.underline} If disarmament, as required
by Article 6 of the NPT 1968, is achieved then, with its might of
conventional weapons and super economic muscle America will prevail.
Small countries like Iran, Syria and North Korea will never be able to
threaten the US security any longer - the tail will not wag the dog.

### 1NC- UN Module

#### The United States federal government should:

#### -ratify the Arms Trade Treaty

#### -enforce the UN Programme of Action on small arms

#### The UN is uniquely key to prevent gender-based violence worldwide

**Gerome 16** (Rebecca Gerome, April 2016, "Preventing Gendered Violence
Through Arms Control,"
<https://www.peacewomen.org/sites/default/files/preventing-gbv.pdf>)//EK

Every day around the world, [conventional weapons exacerbate power
differences and facilitate acts of violence, including those rooted in
gender discrimination. Armed violence is often an expression of violent
masculinity. Across all cultures, young men are the overwhelming
majority of users as well as direct victims of injury and death caused
by conventional weapons. Gender-based violence (GBV), which is any
violence directed at a person based on discriminating norms and
practises relating to her or his specific sex or gender role in society,
disproportionately affects women and is much harder to measure and
assess. **Effective implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) and
the UN Programme of Action on small arms (UNPoA) presents a unique
opportunity to prevent GBV**. The ATT specifically requires that states
assess the risk of GBV before approving an arms export. A number of
experts1 and government export licensing officials2 have highlighted the
need for guidance, especially on how states should take the risk of GBV
into account when assessing arms exports.]{.underline} One government
official stated that although there is "a general principle" that is
being discussed in various disarmament forums, "there is very little
tangible specificity that goes with it, for people that are not in the
field. That is why it is something that is not in the core principles
guiding the export licensing process."3 Another expressed the need for a
reference guide to use on a daily basis and for discussions among states
parties.

### Solvency- GBV

#### **The UN has unique presence with gendered based violence**

**Gerome 16** (Rebecca Gerome, April 2016, "Preventing Gendered Violence
Through Arms Control,"
<https://www.peacewomen.org/sites/default/files/preventing-gbv.pdf>)//EK

[The ATT is the first multilateral treaty to recognise the link between
the international arms trade and GBV. It builds on widespread precedent
from national, regional, and international courts and UN human rights
bodies recognizing that gender-based violence is a violation of
international human rights, and can also constitute a war crime, a crime
against humanity, or genocide, depending on the
circumstances.]{.underline} GBV is therefore covered under multiple
provisions in Article 6 and Article 7 of the ATT. Article 7(4), a
separate provision, which stipulates that states parties "must take into
account" the risk of gender-based violence "in making this assessment,"
means that GBV must be analysed under each sub-section of Article 6 and
Article 7. Even if serious violations of international human rights law
or international humanitarian law include acts of GBV, it is important
to have the GBV criterion included specifically as it is often
overlooked in assessments of rights violations. The export officials
interviewed for this study often referred to the repression of public
protests when speaking about their existing human rights risk
assessments. As opposed to public protests, which are often documented
in social media, if not in the mainstream media, GBV is often invisible.
[Indeed, of all the grave human rights violations monitored by the
Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict, rape and sexual
violence is the most underreported.9 Human rights organisations have
pointed out time and again that both male and female victims of GBV are
stigmatised and reluctant to talk.10 This is because of the risks,
trauma, shame, and stigma faced not only by those who come forward, but
also witnesses, human rights defenders, service providers, journalists,
and justice officials.11]{.underline} Furthermore, GBV is often not a
policy priority.12 It disproportionately affects women, who are in a
disadvantaged position compared to men when it comes to highlighting and
confronting human rights abuses. [In his 2015 report on conflictrelated
sexual violence, the UN SecretaryGeneral remarked, "despite the
political momentum and visibility gained in recent years, the reality on
the ground is that many governments have not been able to create an
environment in which survivors feel safe to report sexual violence. The
fear of stigmatization and reprisals is almost
universal."13]{.underline}

Ted Bromund, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said the
treaty could impinge on U.S. sovereignty in the future. "The ATT is, in
effect, an escalator: Once you step onto it, you are no longer in
control of your direction of travel." Its supporters dismiss those
claims and say the treaty was drafted to have no effect on gun laws in
the United States. They say any new amendments only affect states that
ratify them. "[This is yet another instance of the Trump administration
turning its back on multilateral diplomacy]{.underline}," said Rachel
Stohl, managing director of the Stimson Center, a Washington think tank,
who contributed to the drafting of the treaty. "**[By not participating
in the ATT, the United States is undermining global norms around the
arms trade]{.underline}**," she said. "[It says to other countries, 'The

The U.N. process towards an ATT [Before the ATT]{.underline} entered
into force on Dec. 24, 2014, [there were more international laws in the
world regulating the trade of bananas than the arms trade.]{.underline}
For many years, civil society had recognized this deficiency and called
for global action. In 1997, for example, a group of 19 eminent persons
and institutions that had received the Nobel Prize for Peace ---
including Dr. Oscar Arias Sánchez, former President of Costa Rica;
Desmond Tutu; José Ramos Horta and Amnesty International --- launched
and International Code of Conduct on Arms Transfers. This initiative
made its way to the U.N. a few years later via the Permanent Mission of
Costa Rica in New York. [The lack of an international global framework
for the trade in arms was profoundly worrisome given the **immense
volume** of the global trade in conventional arms and its **potential
effect in the disruption of peace and sustainable
development**]{.underline}. Former U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon
had indicated that: "The world is overarmed and peace is underfunded.
Military spending is on the rise. Today, it is well above \$1 trillion a
year. Let us look at Africa alone. Between 1990 and 2005, 23 African
countries lost an estimated \$284 billion as a result of armed
conflicts, fueled by transfers of ammunition and arms --- 95 per cent of
which came from outside Africa. And globally, 60 years of United Nations
peacekeeping operations have cost less than six weeks of current
military spending." After years of informal discussions, and with
mounting pressure from civil society, the U.N. initiated a process to
negotiate the first global international agreement to regulate the licit
trade in arms, finally putting an end to this important gap in
international law. This process was long and complicated, as are most
multilateral processes at the U.N. It included the establishment of a
Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) in 2008, whose mandate was to
examine the feasibility, scope and draft parameters for a comprehensive,
legally binding instrument establishing common international standards
for the import, export and transfer of conventional arms. This was
followed by the establishment, in 2009, of an open-ended working group
of the General Assembly to consider the report of the GGE and the
recommendation of an international instrument on the matter. After this,
the decision was made to establish a preparatory committee, which had
two sessions in 2010 and 2011, respectively, followed by the U.N.
Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty, held in 2012. Then, the Final U.N.
Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty was convened in 2013, since no
agreement could be reached the year before. The final treaty text had to
be adopted by consensus, according to the Rules of Procedure of the
Conference agreed to by the preparatory committee. During the first
Conference, both Russia and the U.S. indicated that they were not ready
to adopt the draft text put forward by Argentinian President Roberto
García Moritán. As a consequence, the General Assembly convened the
Final Conference, where general agreement, including by Russia and the
U.S., grew around the draft text prepared by Australian President Peter
Woolcott. However, on the last day of the Final U.N. Conference (March
28, 2013), Syria, Iran and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK), blocked the adoption of the treaty by consensus. Therefore, on
April 1, 2013, a draft resolution was submitted to the General Assembly
for the adoption of the treaty. The resolution was co-sponsored by 64
U.N. member States, including the U.S. The ATT was consequently adopted
by the U.N. General Assembly on April 2, 2013, with 154 votes in favor
and only 3 against (DPRK, Iran and Syria), and with 23 abstentions. To
this date, the treaty has 130 signatories and 101 States Parties. I had
the opportunity to serve in the Mexican delegation throughout the
negotiation process, starting with the negotiation and adoption of
General Assembly resolution 64/48 in 2009, and through the adoption of
the treaty in 2013. I can attest to the hard work and effort that it
took both Amb. García Moritán and Amb. Woolcott, as well as all
delegations, to come together on an issue that has an inherent trend to
polarization and that touches upon very sensitive issues for States
including concerns about their own security and stability. **[From the
Mexican perspective, this is a particularly important legal instrument
given the great challenges and threats posed by the illicit trade of
arms that flows mostly from the U.S. border into Mexico, fueling
organized crime]{.underline}**. To exemplify this, [the negotiations
coincided with the exposure of the highly controversial U.S. Fast and
Furious operation]{.underline}, [where the]{.underline} Phoenix Field
Division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives
([ATF]{.underline}), [allowed illegal gun sales in an attempt to track
the sellers and buyers, who were believed to be connected to Mexican
drug cartels.]{.underline} As Roberto Dondisch, chief negotiator of the
Mexican delegation, has written elsewhere ('El Tratado de Comercio de
Armas, un éxito de la diplomacia mexicana' in México y el
Multilateralismo del Siglo XXI), the U.S. and Mexico always kept a very
close relationship throughout the negotiations. Despite having
substantial differences in our approaches to certain aspects of the
treaty, we always maintained the utmost respect in our exchanges and we
worked hand in hand towards bridging those differences in favor of
achieving a meaningful legal instrument. The fact that both teams ---
led by Dr. Dondisch on the Mexican side, and by Amb. Thomas Countryman,
who left the State Department in January 2017, on the U.S. side ---
overcame what initially were perceived as irreconcilable positions and
ended up cosponsoring the draft resolution through which the ATT was
adopted by the General Assembly, proves that where there is a will,
there is a way. The ATT at a glance What does the ATT do? As indicated
by its name, the [Arms Trade Treaty regulates the international licit
trade of arms.]{.underline} Its object and purpose, which is clearly
spelled out in Article 1, is the following: "[The object]{.underline} of
this Treaty [is to]{.underline}: [Establish the highest possible common
international standards for regulating or improving the regulation of
the international trade in conventional arms]{.underline}; [Prevent and
eradicate the illicit trade in conventional arms and prevent their
diversion;]{.underline} for the purpose of: Contributing to
international and regional peace, security and stability; Reducing human
suffering; Promoting cooperation, transparency and responsible action by
States Parties in the international trade in conventional arms, thereby
building confidence among States Parties." [Other relevant aspects of
the treaty to be highlighted are]{.underline}: i) [its scope includes
small arms and light weapons]{.underline}; ii) State Parties have the
obligation to establish and maintain a national control system to
regulate the export of ammunition/munitions; iii) the treaty establishes
a system to conduct an assessment, including the consideration of
possible mitigation measures, before authorizing an export of weapons;
iv) it includes measures to prevent the diversion of arms, and v) it
includes a yearly reporting mechanism of authorized or actual exports
and imports of conventional arms. In a nutshell, the [ATT sets out
global standards to conduct legal and rightful activities in a
transparent manner. This]{.underline}, in turn, [helps to identify where
and how arms are diverted into the illicit market and raises the bar
regarding accountability for irresponsible transfers of
arms.]{.underline} What does the ATT not do? It is not a disarmament
treaty nor a treaty for the reduction of arsenals; it does not prohibit
the international trade in arms, and; it does not regulate, in any way,
internal transactions, in particular the acquisition of arms by
civilians. Contrary to what Trump has declared, the treaty explicitly
reaffirms "the sovereign right of any State to regulate and control
conventional arms exclusively within its territory, pursuant to its own
legal or constitutional system." In other words, the ATT is absolutely
silent on controls, regulations, limitations, rights or obligations
regarding the domestic sale of arms. Therefore, claiming that the ATT
breaches sovereign rights of States, specifically the second amendment
to the U.S. Constitution, is not a matter of misinterpretation: It is
simply not true. It is also very important to understand what is the
extent of the legal obligations arising from signing the ATT. A
signatory to an international treaty is not a State Party. According to
Article 18 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) of
1969, a State that has signed a treaty has the obligation to refrain
from acts which would defeat the object and purpose of said treaty. No
more and no less. The signature does not unfold the totality of the
rights and obligations established in the treaty. This would only happen
if the State became a party, having expressed its consent to be bound,
namely through ratification, acceptance, approval or accession. It is
also worth noting that there is no such thing as a revocation of
signature of treaties in the VCLT. However, the obligation not to defeat
the object and purpose of a treaty arising from its signature lasts
until the State has made its intention clear not to become a party to
the treaty, which presumably will be the case of the ATT (as of the time
of writing of this essay, no notification in this regard has been
deposited by the U.S. before the U.N. Treaty Section, which serves as
depositary of the Treaty).

### AT: Circumvention

#### Ratifying the ATT ensures arms aren't diverted

[The ATT makes the international arms trade safer and more
responsible]{.underline}. [It requires governments, before granting an
export license for weapons, to consider whether weapons **could be used
for genocide or human rights violations**]{.underline}, **[as well as
the likelihood that the weapons would be diverted into the wrong hands
and fuel civil conflict or criminal activity]{.underline}**. It provides
mechanisms for governments to cooperate and a means for greater
transparency over a murky trade that contributes to devastating human
suffering --- including casualties to American service members and
civilians --- in conflicts in places like Syria, Yemen and Libya. [This
treaty reflects U.S. values and priorities]{.underline}. Throughout the
negotiations, we, as the U.N. consultant and the U.S. government team,
met regularly with interested defense industry and nongovernmental
organizations, briefing simultaneously defense exporters, human rights
advocates and Second Amendment advocates of how the ATT furthered U.S.
interests. Industry, in particular, expressed the hope that requiring
other nations to meet American-style standards would help level the
playing field in the global arms market and close loopholes in other
countries that allow unscrupulous dealers to undermine legal U.S.
transactions. That hope is now extinguished, as the administration has
chosen to stand with reckless regimes, such as North Korea, Iran and
Syria, and with Russia and China --- and against our biggest allies ---
in allowing an arms trade that flows with impunity. [The Obama
administration viewed the ATT not as an arms control treaty, but as a
trade regulation treaty, one that had the potential to ameliorate the
worst problems created by a wide-open global arms bazaar]{.underline}.
It has now fallen victim to the Trump administration's inherent distrust
of all international treaties. The president's action to remove a
nonexistent "threat" to law-abiding American citizens will not benefit
America's defense industry or American interests. Let's be clear: The
ATT is not perfect. Even if it was fully implemented, it would not solve
all of the challenges created by the global arms trade. But more than
100 other governments have committed to the treaty, and momentum for
implementation is strong. The treaty will survive. [The U.S. reputation
for concern about human suffering and the country's credibility across
all international affairs will suffer the greater harm.]{.underline}

threats to people and planet --- but, equally, at a time of compelling
opportunities for shared prosperity --- there is no way forward but
collective, common-sense action for the common good," he underscored.
"This is how we rebuild trust."]{.underline} The world has also reached
a pivotal moment when world leaders must heed the knowledge of
scientists and guarantee implementation of the 2016 Paris Agreement on
Climate Change to avoid "runaway climate change", he told the Assembly.
The upcoming Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change must be a success, he said, adding that he
plans to convene a summit on the issue in September 2019 --- a year
before States are to revive their Paris pledges. He also underscored the
promise and perils of new technologies, observing that [malicious acts
in cyberspace]{.underline} --- such as disinformation campaigns --- [are
polarizing communities and sowing distrust among States]{.underline}.
[The impact of new technologies on warfare must also be addressed to
avert a new arms race, he said, inviting the international community to
embrace the United Nations as a platform to nurture a digital future
that is safe and beneficial for all]{.underline}. María Fernanda
Espinosa Garcés ([Ecuador]{.underline}), President of the General
Assembly, [said the United Nations is as relevant today as it was 73
years ago when the Organization was founded. Multilateralism is the only
viable response to global problems, she emphasized]{.underline},
inviting Member States to focus on seven priorities --- gender equality
and the empowerment of women, implementation of new global agreements on
refugees and migrants, the creation of decent work opportunities,
protection of the environment, the rights of persons with disabilities,
the revitalization of the United Nations, and peace and security. On the
role of the General Assembly, Ms. Espinosa said it must be the world's
chief peacebuilding organization championing initiatives to ensure
greater youth participation in politics. World leaders must fulfil the
needs of the people, without losing heart in efforts to build a more
peaceful and humane world. Throughout the day, a total of 34 world
leaders from the four corners of the globe addressed the General
Assembly and shared their vision of the world's most pressing
challenges, ranging from climate change, nuclear proliferation and
protracted conflict to large-scale migration, economic inequality and
the elimination of extreme poverty through the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development. Several speakers also addressed United Nations
reforms, including changing the make-up of the 15-nation Security
Council. Paul Kagame, President of Rwanda, drew attention to Africa's
embrace of closer and more productive cooperation through the African
Union and regional economic communities. Once in force, the African
Continental Free Trade Area will redefine Africa's place in the global
economic order while helping its people meet the Sustainable Development
Goals. "The dividend of a more focused and functional Africa benefits
everyone," he said. He added that today's two-track system of global
governance --- in which a few define the norms by which others will be
judged --- is unsustainable. "Addressing this imbalance in the very
foundation of our system is what will give shape to a revival of
multilateral cooperation," he said. "[At a time where our collective
system is falling apart, sadly, it is most in demand]{.underline},"
President Emmanuel [Macron]{.underline} of France [said]{.underline}, as
he proposed the crafting of a new world balance, with new forms of
international and regional cooperation. Ten years after the global
financial crisis, the world is paying a collective price for the
international community's failure to address the unequal spread of
wealth around the globe. Noting that France is the incoming chair of the
Group of Seven, he said inequalities will be addressed in that forum. In
the past, rich countries could impose an agenda on the rest of the
world. Those days are now over, he stated. As well, Africa must be given
a central and leading role in any internationally formed new order, as
it is on this continent that the battle against inequality will be won
or lost. President Donald J. Trump of the United States, making the case
for State sovereignty, said nations can work better together when they
respect their neighbours and defended their people's interests.
Portraying the world as a constellation of unique nations, each shining
brightly, he said sovereign and independent nations are the only
vehicles where freedom, democracy and peace have survived and prospered.
"America's policy of principled realism means we will not be held
hostage to old dogmas, discredited ideologies and so-called experts who
have been proven wrong over the years, time and time again," he said. He
dedicated a portion of his speech to Iran, accusing its leaders of
sowing chaos, death and destruction, disrespecting the borders and
sovereignty of neighbouring States and plundering national resources.
"We cannot allow the world's leading sponsor of terrorism to possess the
planet's most dangerous weapons," he said, upholding his decision to
pull the United States out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and
to reimpose nuclear sanctions on Iran. However, President Hassan Rouhani
of Iran counters those assertions, saying that the current United States
Administration seems determined to render all international institutions
ineffectual. Underscoring that Iran has thus far complied with all its
commitments according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),
he criticized the United States for resorting to a flimsy excuse to
justify its withdrawal from the accord and for pressuring other
countries to violate it. "Unlawful unilateral sanctions in themselves
constitute a form of 'economic terrorism'", he said. While acknowledging
that, at the end of the day, there is no alternative to dialogue, he
expressed objection to the United States' bullying and stressed that no
State or nation can be brought to the negotiation table by force.
Dialogue can resume if "threats and unjust sanctions that negate the
principle of ethics and international law" are ended. Abdullah II ibn al
Hussein, King of [Jordan]{.underline}, [highlighted the importance of
collective action in ending the serious crises in the Middle
East]{.underline}, especially the long denial of a Palestinian State. A
one-State solution will be ugly and undemocratic and by no means an
alternative to a two-State peace settlement, he said. In addition,
noting that Jordan is hosting large numbers of Syrian refugees, he said
the world cannot address the refugee crisis --- or any global crisis ---
"unless we work tougher to support those who are doing the right thing
for the future we all share". President Danny Faure of
[Seychelles]{.underline} [underscored that peace and prosperity cannot
be disassociated from the effects of climate change and its existential
threat to the world]{.underline}. If States fail to uphold climate
commitments, they will face an inescapable crisis, he warned. On
economic development, he said that Seychelles pioneered a Blue Economy
Strategic Framework and Road Map to multiply the potential of its
territorial waters while protecting them for future generations. He also
called for a vulnerability and resilience index that will account for
the unique vulnerabilities of small island developing States. President
Danilo Medina Sánchez of the [Dominican Republic said "there's not a
safe spot on the planet". Addressing the increasing frequency of natural
hazards,]{.underline} he offered examples, including a typhoon that
recently hit the Philippines "with a force not seen in decades" and
cyclonic seasons in the Caribbean. Efforts to mitigate the lives lost
and economic damage sustained must begin at the local level where the
daily life of people develops, which is where his Government is
improving resilience and relocating communities living around vulnerable
areas. In addition, regional and global efforts are needed. Indeed, said
President Hilda C. Heine of the Marshall Islands, the political will to
address climate change must extend to atoll nations like hers, whose
very survival is at risk. Underlining her role as the first female Head
of State in the independent Pacific islands region, she said the United
Nations must accelerate efforts to ensure that all women, especially the
youngest, have a rightful role at all levels of decision-making.
President Lenín Voltaire Moreno Garces of Ecuador, speaking from a
wheelchair, said: "As a person with a disability, I know there will be
no peace unless we have inclusion and we celebrate diversity," adding
that, as a President, that peace becomes possible when efforts are made
on behalf of those who need it most, making sure, without exception,
that everyone is free to realize their dreams every single day
throughout their whole lives. At the outset of the meeting, a moment of
silence was observed in honour of the late Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
who passed away on 18 August. Also speaking today were Heads of State
and Government of Brazil, Turkey, Mexico, Peru, Qatar, Finland, Nigeria,
South Africa, Malawi, Guatemala, Egypt, Paraguay, Argentina,
Switzerland, Sri Lanka, Slovenia, Zambia, Democratic Republic of the
Congo, Kyrgyzstan, Gambia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mozambique, Japan,
Armenia and Morocco. The General Assembly will reconvene at 9 a.m. on
Wednesday, 26 September, to continue its general debate.

Why America Still Needs the United Nations,
<http://www.cfr.org/world/why-america-still-needs-united-nations/p7567>\]

Summary: Multilateralism is a means, not an end, and [there is no more
multilateral body than the UN.]{.underline} That may make it unwieldy at
times, but [the UN\'s **inclusiveness**]{.underline} [is the key to the
legitimacy]{.underline} [**only it** can confer.]{.underline} [The
organization]{.underline} thus [remains an essential force]{.underline}
[in international politics]{.underline}, and one the United States
benefits from greatly. THE POWER OF LEGITIMACY In September 2002, a
radical new document declared that \"no nation can build a safer, better
world alone.\" These words came not from some utopian internationalist
or ivory-tower academic, but from the new National Security Strategy of
the United States. For all its underpinnings in realpolitik, the
strategy committed the United States to multilateralism. This statement
should not have been surprising, for multilateralism, of course, is not
only a means but an end. And for good reason: in international affairs,
the choice of method can serve to advertise a country\'s good faith or
disinterestedness. Most states act both unilaterally and multilaterally
at times: the former in defense of their national security or in their
immediate backyard, the latter in pursuit of global causes. [The larger
a country\'s backyard]{.underline}, however, [the greater the temptation
to act]{.underline} [unilaterally]{.underline} across it \-- [a problem
most acute in the case of the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.
But [the more far-reaching the issue and the]{.underline} [greater the
number of countries affected, the less sufficient unilateralism
proves]{.underline}, [and the less viable it becomes]{.underline}.
[Hence the]{.underline} ongoing [**need** for
multilateralism]{.underline} \-- which the U.S. National Security
Strategy seemed to recognize. [The U]{.underline}nited
[N]{.underline}ations [is the preeminent institution of
multilateralism.]{.underline} [It provides a forum where]{.underline}
sovereign [states can]{.underline} come together to [share
burdens]{.underline}, [address common problems]{.underline}, [and seize
common opportunities]{.underline}. [The UN helps establish]{.underline}
the [norms]{.underline} that many countries \-- including the United
States \-- would like everyone to live by. Throughout its history, the
United States has seen the advantages of living in a world organized
according to laws, values, and principles; in fact, the republic was not
yet 30 years old when it first went to war in defense of international
law (attacking the Barbary pirates in 1804), and it has done so multiple
times since, including in the first Gulf War. The UN, for all its
imperfections \-- real and perceived \-- reflects [this]{.underline}
American preference for an ordered world. That Washington has often used
force on behalf of such principles makes good political sense. After
all, acting in the name of international law is always preferable to
acting in the name of national security. Everyone has a stake in the
former, and so [couching U.S. action in terms of]{.underline}
[international law universalizes]{.underline} American [interests and
comforts potential allies]{.underline}. [When]{.underline} American
[actions seem driven by U.S.]{.underline} national security [imperatives
alone, partners can prove hard to find]{.underline} \-- [as became
clear]{.underline} when, [in]{.underline} marked contrast to
[the]{.underline} first [Gulf War]{.underline}, only a small \"coalition
of the willing\" joined Washington the second time around in Iraq.
[Working within the UN allows the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [to **maximize**]{.underline} what Joseph Nye calls
**[its \"soft power]{.underline}**\" \-- the ability to attract and
persuade others to adopt the American agenda \-- [rather
than]{.underline} relying [purely on]{.underline} the dissuasive or
coercive \"hard power\" of [military force.]{.underline} [Global
challenges]{.underline} also [require global solutions]{.underline}, and
[few indeed are the situations in which the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates or any other country [can act completely
alone]{.underline}. This truism is currently being confirmed in Iraq,
where Washington is discovering that it is better at winning wars than
constructing peace. The limitations of military strength in nation
building are readily apparent; as Talleyrand pointed out, the one thing
you cannot do with a bayonet is to sit on it. [Equally
important]{.underline}, however, [is the need for
legitimacy]{.underline}, and here again the UN has proven invaluable.
The organization\'s role in legitimizing state action has been both its
most cherished function and, in the United States, its most
controversial. As the world\'s preeminent international organization,
the UN embodies world opinion, or at least the opinion of the world\'s
legally constituted states. [When the UN Security Council passes a
resolution]{.underline}, it is seen as speaking for (and in the
interests of) humanity as a whole, and in so doing [it confers a
legitimacy that is respected by the world\'s governments]{.underline},
and usually by their publics. When the resolution in question is passed
under Chapter VII of the charter \-- that document\'s enforcement
provisions \-- it becomes legally binding on all member states. The
composition of the council that passes a particular resolution is no
more relevant to its legitimacy than that of a national parliament that
passes a law; congressional legislation, by the same logic, is not less
binding on Americans if the majority that votes for it comes
overwhelmingly from small states. The legitimacy of the UN inheres in
its universality and not in its structural details, which have long been
subject to the clamor for reform. Some Americans have scorned the status
and conduct of many of the Security Council members that failed to
support the United States on Iraq. But this unseemly sneering over the
right of Angola, Cameroon, or Guinea to pass judgment in the council
overlooks the valuable contribution their presence makes. The election
of small countries to the council bolsters its legitimacy by enhancing
its role as a repository of world opinion. Universality of membership
also allows the world to view the UN as something more than the sum of
its parts, as an entity that transcends the interests of any one member
state. The UN guards the vital principles entrenched in its charter,
notably the sovereign equality of states and the inadmissibility of
interference in their internal affairs. It is precisely because the UN
is the chief guardian of both these sacrosanct principles that it alone
is allowed to approve derogations from them. Thus when the UN, in
particular the Security Council, legislates an intervention in a
sovereign state, it is still seen as upholding the basic principles even
while approving a departure from them. When an individual state acts in
defiance of the UN, on the other hand, it merely violates these
principles. This is why so many countries, including the most powerful
ones, take care to embed their actions within the framework of the
principles and purposes of the UN Charter. For examples of this, one
need only peruse a random selection of speeches by countries explaining
their votes on the Security Council, especially those concerning
military action. The value of internationally recognized principles
resonates across the globe and has been reified through 58 years of
repetition \-- including last March, when the council debated Iraq.
SHOWDOWN IN NEW YORK [To suggest]{.underline} \-- as did some critics of
the UN during the Iraq crisis \-- [that the organization has become
irrelevant overlooks the]{.underline} [message]{.underline} President
George W. [Bush himself sent when he appeared before the General
Assembly]{.underline} in September 2002. In calling on the Security
Council to take action, Bush framed the problem of Iraq as a question
not of what the United States (unilaterally) wanted, but of how to
implement Security Council resolutions. Indeed, these resolutions were
at the heart of the U.S. case. Had the Security Council been able to
agree that force was warranted, it would have provided unique (and
incontestable) legitimacy for U.S. military action. The fact that the
council did not ultimately agree, however, strengthens, rather than
dilutes, the rationale for approaching it in such situations. [The
council\'s refusal to serve as a rubber stamp for]{.underline}
[Washington will give any future support it lends to the United States
greater credibility]{.underline}. Council resolutions do not serve only
to codify the acceptable in the eyes of the world; they also, quite
directly, lay down the law. In fact, several countries, from Norway to
India, do not or cannot (as a matter of politics, policy, or
constitutional law) commit forces overseas without the council\'s
explicit authorization. Such a practice ensures that these countries
will not be drawn into military adventures at the behest of one or a
handful of powerful states. They send troops only when the Security
Council, speaking in the name of the world as a whole, blesses an
enterprise. Nonetheless, since the Iraq crisis, some critics have
suggested that \"coalitions of the willing\" will eventually eliminate
the need for formal structures such as the UN. \"Multilateralism á la
carte,\" the thinking goes, will replace \"multilateralism á la
charte.\" But even ad hoc coalitions require structure: many states,
when asked by Washington to contribute troops for Iraq, have hesitated
to do so without the sanction of a UN resolution or a UN-authorized
command structure. [International institutions give the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates\' [potential partners a
framework within which they can feel empowered on]{.underline} (at least
notionally) [equal terms]{.underline} \-- and without which they are not
willing to participate. Put another way, the difference between a UN
operation, in which everyone wears a blue helmet, and a \"coalition of
the willing\" led by one big power is similar to that between a police
squad and a posse. Posses are more difficult to find and to fund than
are police. Similarly, developing countries in any coalition need
financing in order to play their part, and such financing is more easily
provided through the UN\'s agreed cost-sharing formula. [Unilateralism
is always more expensive than its alternative]{.underline}, and in
today\'s tight world economy, [the costs of international unilateralism
may no longer be sustainable]{.underline}. Even when a Security Council
resolution is not legally required for an action, the UN\'s imprimatur
can still prove extremely useful for the United States. A council
decision does not just spread expense and political risk, by diluting
Washington\'s responsibility for a course of action that might provoke
resentment or hostility. It is also easier for many governments to sell
a policy to their publics if they can describe it as a response to a UN
resolution, instead of to an American request. The United States has
already learned this lesson: for example, when it has tried to prompt
countries to revise and update their domestic security procedures or
laws on terrorism, it has discovered that governments are often happier
to receive the same American expert as a UN adviser than as a U.S. one.
In fact, part of the value of the UN (including for Washington) is the
respect in which its members hold the body. Such respect has permitted
the United States, on numerous occasions, to advance its specific
interests under the cover of international law. For example, UN
sanctions on Libya helped the United States achieve a settlement over
the Lockerbie bombing. And after the attacks of September 11, 2001, the
Security Council\'s two subsequent resolutions provided an international
framework for the global battle against terrorism. Resolution 1373
required nations to interdict arms flows and financial transfers to
suspected terrorist groups, report on terrorists\' movements, and update
national legislation to fight them. Without the legal authority of a
binding Security Council resolution, Washington would have been
hard-pressed to obtain such cooperation \"retail\" from 191 individual
states, and it would have taken decades to negotiate and ratify separate
treaties and conventions imposing the same standards on all countries.
As such examples demonstrate, [it is clearly not in the U.S. interest to
discredit the UN]{.underline} or the Security Council. For every rare
occasion when the council thwarts Washington, there are a dozen more
when it acts in accordance with U.S. wishes and compels other countries
to do the same. [To marginalize the council, then]{.underline}, [would
be to blunt a vital arrow in the U.S. diplomatic]{.underline}
[quiver]{.underline}**.** BEYOND LIMITS [What about the Security
Council\'s structural deficiencies?]{.underline} For all the carping
about its outdated composition \-- which, by common consensus, reflects
the geopolitical realities of 1945 rather than 2003 \-- [no other body
has acquired the kind of]{.underline} [legitimacy it brings to bear on
world affairs.]{.underline} [The council may need reform]{.underline},
therefore, [but]{.underline} until member states agree on how to go
about making changes, [it remains **the only**]{.underline} **[global
body]{.underline}** [with responsibility for maintaining international
peace]{.underline} and security. [Suggestions that the UN should be
replaced]{.underline} \-- by a coalition of democracies, for example \--
[overlook the fact that **during the Iraq debate, the most vigorous
resistance** to the United States in the council **came from other
democracies.**]{.underline} [Nor is NATO a]{.underline} [feasible
alternative to the council]{.underline}, [because its legitimacy is
geographically limited]{.underline}, [as is that of other regional
organizations]{.underline}. NATO authorization might have been deemed
sufficient for the Kosovo campaign. But in that war, the target was
another European state, Yugoslavia. NATO\'s imprimatur would not have
been enough to justify military action in Iraq, which is why the United
States and the United Kingdom tried so hard to get the Security
Council\'s benediction for that action. In any case, the council\'s
final vote (or lack thereof) on Iraq was not the only gauge of its
relevance to that situation. Just four years ago, when NATO bombed
Yugoslavia without even referring to the council (let alone securing its
approval), many critics similarly argued that the UN had become
irrelevant. But the Kosovo question soon came up again at the Security
Council, first when an unsuccessful attempt was made to condemn the
bombing, and then when arrangements had to be made to administer the
province after the war. [**Only the Security Council could** have
approved the arrangements so as to **confer** on them international
**legitimacy and encourage** all **nations to** **extend** their
**support** and resources]{.underline}. And [only one body was trusted
enough to run the civilian administration of Kosovo: the
U]{.underline}nited [N]{.underline}ations. The same pattern was not
followed precisely in the case of Iraq, but the events were similar.
Resolution 1483, adopted unanimously on May 22, granted the UN a
significant role in postwar Iraq. That the United States chose to give
the UN such a prominent position reflects not just British pressure but
also Washington\'s own recognition that it needs the world body. Indeed,
the very fact that the United States submitted the resolution to the
Security Council was an acknowledgment by Washington that there is, in
Secretary-General Kofi Annan\'s words, no substitute for the unique
legitimacy provided by the UN. The body might have been written off
during the war. But [as with Kosovo, it was quickly found to be
**essential to** the ensuing **peace**.]{.underline} Of course, peace
can be kept in many ways, and Kosovo, East Timor, Afghanistan, and now
Iraq offer four different models for how the UN can engage in
postconflict situations. But [peacekeeping]{.underline} ([which includes
mediation, monitoring, and disarmament]{.underline}) [remains exactly
the kind of mission where using the UN has advantages for Washington
that greatly outweigh the negatives]{.underline}. First, [there is the
obvious attraction of burden-sharing: UN peacekeeping allows other
countries to help shoulder the U]{.underline}nited
[St]{.underline}ates\' [responsibility for maintaining
peace]{.underline} around the world. Second, [despite some
well-publicized failures, **UN peacekeeping works**.]{.underline} The
UN\'s \"blue helmets\" won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1988; since then,
[they have brought peace and democracy to Namibia, Cambodia, El
Salvador, Mozambique, and East Timor]{.underline}; helped ease the U.S.
burden after regime changes in Haiti and Afghanistan; and policed
largely bloodless stalemates from Cyprus to the Golan Heights to Western
Sahara. Third, [UN peacekeeping is highly cost-effective]{.underline}.
The UN is used to running operations on a shoestring, and [it spends
less per year on peacekeeping worldwide than is spent on the budgets of
the New York City Fire and Police Departments]{.underline}. [UN
peacekeeping is also far cheaper than **the alternative, which is
war**.]{.underline} Two days of Operation Desert Storm in 1991 cost more
than the entire UN peacekeeping budget that year, and one week of
Operation Iraqi Freedom would amply pay for all UN peacekeeping for
2003. The UN operation that ended the Iran-Iraq War cost less annually
than the crude oil carried in two supertankers. Considering how many
supertankers were placed at risk during that ruinous conflict, this
makes peacekeeping an extraordinary bargain. [None of this is to deny
that the Security Council\'s record has been mixed. The body has acted
unwisely at times and failed to act]{.underline} [altogether at
others]{.underline}: one need only think of the fate of the \"safe
areas\" in Bosnia and the genocide in Rwanda for instances of each. The
council has also sometimes been too divided to succeed, as was the case
in early 2003 over Iraq. And all too often, member states have passed
resolutions they had no intention of implementing. But the UN, at its
best, is only a mirror of the world: it reflects divisions and
disagreements as well as hopes and convictions. [Sometimes it only
muddles through]{.underline}. As Dag Hammarskjöld, the UN\'s second
secretary-general, put it, [the UN was not created to take humanity to
heaven but to save it from hell.]{.underline} And [this it has done
innumerable times]{.underline}, especially during the Cold War, [when it
prevented regional or local conflicts from]{.underline} **[igniting a
superpower conflagration]{.underline}**. To suggest, on the basis of the
disagreement over Iraq, that the Security Council has become
dysfunctional or irrelevant is to greatly distort the record by viewing
it through the prism of just one issue. [Even while]{.underline}
[disagreeing]{.underline} on Iraq, [the members]{.underline} of the
Security Council [unanimously agreed **on a host of other vital
issues**]{.underline}, from Congo to Côte d\'Ivoire, from Cyprus to
Afghanistan. Indeed, the Security Council remains on the whole a
remarkably harmonious body. Authorizing wars has never been among its
principal responsibilities \-- only twice in its 58 years of existence
has the council explicitly done so \-- and it seems unduly harsh to
condemn it solely over its handling of so rare a challenge. In any case,
it would be folly to discredit an entire institution for a disagreement
among its members. One would not close down the Senate (or even the
Texas legislature) because its members failed to agree on one bill. The
UN\'s record of success and failure is no worse than that of most
representative national institutions, yet its detractors seem to expect
the UN to succeed (or at least to agree with the United States) all the
time. Too often, the UN\'s critics seem to miss another fundamental
characteristic of the world body: the way it functions both as a stage
and as an actor. On the one hand, the UN is a stage on which its member
states declaim their differences and their convergences. Yet the UN is
also an actor (particularly in the person of the secretary-general, his
staff, agencies, and operations) that executes the policies made on its
stage. The general public usually fails to see this distinction and
views the UN as a shapeless aggregation. Sins (of omission or
commission) committed by individual governments on the UN stage are thus
routinely blamed on the organization itself. Sometimes member states
deliberately contribute to this confusion, as when American [officials
blamed the UN for not preventing genocide in Rwanda \-- despite the fact
that Washington itself had blocked]{.underline} [the Security Council
from taking action in that crisis.]{.underline} Indeed, one of the more
unpleasant, if convenient, uses to which the UN has regularly been put
has been to serve as a pliant scapegoat for the failures of its member
states. Former Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali ruefully noted
this point when alleged UN deficiencies were blamed for the purely
American-made disaster in Mogadishu in October 1993. And Annan has often
joked that the abbreviation by which he is known inside the organization
\-- \"SG\" \-- stands for \"scapegoat,\" not \"secretary-general.\"
There is, sadly, considerable utility in having an institution that, by
embodying the collective will (or lack thereof) of 191 member states,
can safely be blamed for the errors that no individual state could
politically afford to admit. But those who need a whipping boy must be
careful not to flog him to death. IN IT TOGETHER The UN\'s relevance
does not stand or fall on its conduct on any one issue. When the crisis
has passed, the world will still be left with, to use Annan\'s phrase,
innumerable \"problems without passports\" \-- [threats such as the
**proliferation**]{.underline} of weapons of mass destruction (WMD),
**[the degradation of our]{.underline}** common
**[environment]{.underline}**, contagious **[disease]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** chronic **[starvation]{.underline}**, **[human
rights]{.underline}** and human wrongs, mass illiteracy
[and]{.underline} massive [displacement]{.underline}. [These are
problems that no one]{.underline} [country]{.underline}, however
powerful, [can solve alone.]{.underline} [The problems are the shared
responsibility of humankind]{.underline} [and cry out for]{.underline}
[solutions that, like the problems themselves, also cross
frontiers]{.underline}. [The UN exists to find these solutions through
the common]{.underline} [endeavor of all states]{.underline}. [It is the
**indispensable global organization**]{.underline} for a globalizing
world. [Large portions of the world\'s population require the UN\'s
assistance to surmount problems they cannot overcome on their
own]{.underline}. As these words are written, civil war rages in Congo
and Liberia and sputters in Côte d\'Ivoire, while long-running conflicts
may be close to permanent solution in Cyprus and Sierra Leone. The
arduous task of nation building proceeds fitfully in Afghanistan, the
Balkans, East Timor, and Iraq. Twenty million refugees and displaced
persons, from Palestine to Liberia and beyond, depend on the UN for
shelter and succor. Decades of development in Africa are being wiped out
by the scourge of hiv/aids (and its deadly interaction with famine and
drought), and the Millennium Development Goals \-- agreed on with much
fanfare in September 2000, at the UN\'s Millennium Summit, the largest
gathering of heads of government in human history \-- remain
unfulfilled. [Too many countries still lack the wherewithal to eliminate
poverty, educate girls, safeguard health, and provide their]{.underline}
[people with clean drinking water]{.underline}. If the UN did not exist
to help tackle these problems, they would undoubtedly end up on the
doorstep of the world\'s only superpower. [The UN is also essential to
Americans\' pursuit of their own prosperity]{.underline}. Today, whether
one is from Tashkent or Tallahassee, it is simply not realistic to think
only in terms of one\'s own country. [Global forces press in from every
conceivable direction]{.underline}; people, goods, and ideas cross
borders and cover vast distances with ever greater frequency, speed, and
ease. The Internet is emblematic of an era in which what happens in
Southeast Asia or southern Africa \-- from democratic advances to
deforestation to the fight against aids \-- can affect Americans. As has
been observed about water pollution, we all live downstream now. Thus
U.S. foreign policy today has become as much a matter of managing global
issues as managing bilateral ones. At the same time, the concept of the
nation-state as self-sufficient has also weakened; although the state
remains the primary political unit, most citizens now instinctively
understand that it cannot do everything on its own. To function in the
world, people increasingly have to deal with institutions and
individuals beyond their country\'s borders. American [jobs
depend]{.underline} not only [on]{.underline} local firms and factories,
but also on [faraway markets]{.underline}, grants of licenses and access
from foreign governments, [international trade rules that ensure the
free movement of goods]{.underline} and persons, and international
financial institutions that ensure stability. [There are thus few
unilateralists in the]{.underline} American [business
community]{.underline}. [Americans\' safety]{.underline}, meanwhile,
[depends]{.underline} not only on local police forces, but also [on
guarding against the global spread of pollution, disease, terror,
illegal drugs, and WMD.]{.underline} As the World Health Organization\'s
successful battle against the dreaded sars epidemic has demonstrated,
[\"problems without passports\" are those that only international action
can solve.]{.underline} [Fortunately, the UN]{.underline} and its broad
family of agencies [have]{.underline}, in nearly six decades of life,
[built a **remarkable record of expertise**]{.underline} and achievement
on these issues. [The UN has brought humanitarian relief to millions
in]{.underline} need and helped people rebuild their countries from the
ruins of war. [It has challenged poverty, fought apartheid, protected
the rights of children]{.underline}, [promoted decolonization and
democracy]{.underline}, [and placed environmental and gender issues at
the top of the world\'s agenda]{.underline}. These are no small
achievements, and represent issues the United States cannot afford to
neglect. [The United Nations is a valuable antidote to the tendency to
disregard the problems of the periphery]{.underline} \-- the kinds of
problems Americans may prefer not to deal with but that are impossible
to ignore. [Handling them multilaterally is the obvious way
to]{.underline} [**ensure** they are tackled]{.underline}; it is also
the only way. Americans will be safer in a world improved by the UN\'s
efforts, which will be needed long after Iraq has passed from the
headlines. KEEPING GULLIVER ON BOARD [The exercise of American
power]{.underline} [may well be the central issue in world politics
today]{.underline}, [but that power is only enhanced if its use
is]{.underline} [perceived as legitimate]{.underline}**.** Ironically,
although many in Washington distrust the world body, many abroad think
the Security Council is too much in thrall to its most powerful member.
The debates over Iraq proved that that is not always the case; but even
if it were, it is far better to have a world organization that is
anchored in geopolitical reality than one that is too detached from the
verities of global power to be effective. [A UN that provides a vital
political and diplomatic framework for the actions of its most powerful
member, while casting them in the context of international law and
legitimacy]{.underline} (and bringing to bear on them the perspectives
and concerns of its universal membership) [is a UN that remains
essential to the world in which we live.]{.underline} The goals of the
charter, however, cannot be met without embracing the fundamental
premise that President Harry Truman enunciated in 1945: We all have to
recognize that no matter how great our strength, we must deny ourselves
the license to do always as we please. No one nation \... can or should
expect any special privilege which harms any other nation. \... Unless
we are all willing to pay that price, no organization for world peace
can accomplish its purpose. And what a reasonable price that is! [The
UN]{.underline}, from the start, [assumed the willingness of its members
to accept **restraints**]{.underline} on their own short-term goals and
policies [by subordinating their actions to]{.underline} internationally
agreed [rules]{.underline} and procedures, in the broader long-term
interests of world order. This [was an explicit alternative to the model
of past centuries]{.underline}, when strong states developed their
military power to enforce their politics, and weak states took refuge in
alliances with stronger ones. [This formula guaranteed **large-scale
warfare**]{.underline}; as Franklin Roosevelt put it to both houses of
Congress after the Allied conference at Yalta, the UN would replace the
arms races, military alliances, balance-of-power politics, and \"all the
arrangements that had led to war\" so often in the past. The UN was
meant to help create a world in which its member states would overcome
their vulnerabilities by embedding themselves in international
institutions, where the use of force would be subjected to the
constraints of international law. Power politics would not disappear
from the face of the earth but would be practiced with due regard for
universally upheld rules and norms. Such a system also offered the
United States \-- then, as now, the world\'s unchallenged superpower \--
the assurance that other countries would not feel the need to develop
coalitions to balance its power. Instead, the UN provided a framework
for them to work in partnership with the United States.

[Limit the use of arms by government forces to their service
times:]{.underline} [preventing]{.underline} police, military and
[others from carrying weapons outside of service would help prevent
diversion and armed violence in the home]{.underline}.285 In Argentina,
the Ministry of National Security restricted the carrying and use of
arms by security forces.286 The regulation refers explicitly to
legislation on violence against women and family violence and
established that members of the security forces are not allowed to bring
their weapons home.287 Gun control legislation [Spousal notification is
an efficient mechanism to prevent armed domestic violence and gun
acquisition by people with a history of committing acts of
GBV,]{.underline} whether or not it resulted in a conviction. For
example, Canada requires current and former spouses to be notified
before a gun license may be issued. [Background and criminal record
checks must include verifying an applicant's past record related to
family or partner violence.]{.underline}288 In the US, federal law makes
it a criminal offence to possess a gun while subject to an intimate
partner violence restraining order and eleven U.S. states have laws that
prevent individuals with a history of intimate partner violence from
purchasing or possessing an arm.289 In Antigua and Barbuda, [anyone with
a history of sexual violence is prohibited from possessing a
firearm.]{.underline}290 Chile has established legislation stating that
any person sanctioned under the law on domestic violence will not have
access to small arms.291 In Nicaragua, the law states that people found
guilty of domestic violence, human trafficking, and sexual violence will
not have access to weapons.292 In Panama, people with a history of
domestic violence cannot receive authorisation to carry small arms.293 •
Registration of firearms is essential for police to be able to
effectively remove guns in situations of intimate partner violence and
enforce prohibition orders.294 • [For all gun control laws, it is
essential for legislators to consult women's groups and LGTB rights
groups.]{.underline} The Philippines recently enacted new gun laws.
Women's groups and NGOs submitted concrete proposals and worked hard to
include provisions on gender and GBV in a review of the national gun
laws. Yet their demands were ignored.295 In a meeting with 500
participants to discuss the new provisions, only five women were
present.296 National action plans on 1325 and SALW control • Argentina,

IK

Despite current efforts by the United States to assist with the Mexican
Drug War, the violence is increasing and the cartels are gaining ground.
[The United States must reassert its efforts in order to roll back the
influence of the cartels and end their reign. We advise a two front
approach to combatting the cartels: reducing the large demand for drugs
in the U.S., and collaborate with the Mexican government to target the
cartels in Mexico.]{.underline} In order to address the large [demand of
drugs in the United States]{.underline}, which [fuels much of the sale
of drugs from Mexico]{.underline}, [domestic policy should continue to
include treatment, prevention, and enforcement measures.]{.underline}
Studies have shown that treatment is cost-effective and can be
cost-reducing, especially when targeted to specific and at-risk
populations, because it can reduce individual drug use and reduce
drug-related risks from crime, overdose, and HIV infection. These
measures, notably the reduction in crime, increase the social good and
support the implementation of treatment programs aimed at drug users,
particularly drug-related offenders. However, while treatment greatly
reduces drug use in drug users, treatment alone is not significantly
effective in reducing the number of drug users in the U.S.91 [Broad
prevention programs that target common risk factors associated with
unhealthy and antisocial behaviors]{.underline} (which may lead youth to
engage in substance abuse) [have been shown to reduce drug initiation
and also have positive effects on youth health and
wellbeing]{.underline}. Such prevention programs can have great success
when enacted in school settings because of the benefits they may bring
to students, as long as quality is ascertained.92 Efforts should also be
put into studying secondary and tertiary prevention programs and their
effectiveness. [Enforcement programs are a necessary component of drug
use reduction, but the scope of and effectiveness of these programs must
be scrutinized and researched.]{.underline} A 2007 study has shown that
the effectiveness of enforcement techniques depends greatly on the stage
of the drug "epidemic" and that enforcement is most fruitful (in use
reduction) when the drug "epidemic" is in its early stages.93
[Specifically, more research should be done into the effectiveness of
interdiction and when it ceases to be useful,]{.underline} seeing as one
1993 study has shown that interdiction is unlikely to reduce consumption
by raising drug prices and reducing drug availability.94 A prime area
for expansion is greater coordination between low-level enforcers and
treatment providers: when arresting offenders, treatment as an
alternative to penal punishment would serve as a form of secondary or
tertiary prevention and could lead to use reduction. [It is necessary to
examine the effectiveness of use reduction techniques (prevention,
treatment, and enforcement) in relation to how much is spent on each
method and subsequently strike a balance between the three. It is also
necessary to realize that, due to the natural variations in drug use,
each main method of reducing drug use is most useful at a certain stage
in a drug "epidemic": enforcement in the early stages, treatment as the
epidemic matures, and non-specific prevention can occur
consistently.]{.underline}95 The current administration has made large
efforts to increase funds aimed at treatment and the consolidation of
funds for programs and methods which have proven to be effective.
However, [there must be objective scrutiny of each method in relation to
its effectiveness and how cooperation between methods can be increased
to form a dynamic domestic drug policy. On the front of assisting the
Mexican government, two measures could be taken by the U.S. government
to improve the efforts of combatting the cartel. Firstly, the passing of
a bill to label the Mexican drug cartels international terrorist
organizations. This act would allow all those caught assisting the
cartels by any means in the United States could be tried for supporting
terrorism. This would dramatically increase the punishment for
perpetrators.]{.underline}96 [Also, such a move would require U.S.
financial institutions to freeze suspected cartel assets in their
possession and report them to the Department of Treasury. By declaring
the cartels foreign terrorist organizations, the U.S. would be able to
deter cartel affiliates through stronger penalties and better
counter-financing. Secondly, the U.S. should continue to support the
Merida Initiative, with an increased emphasis on the training and
advisement of Mexican law enforcement and military
personnel.]{.underline} The cartel situation is one that is similar to
that of an insurgency. [The Mexican government is at war with
organizations seeking geographic control of the country]{.underline}.
[The counter-insurgency experience of American personnel in the civilian
and military sector can be used to Mexican advantage. Counter-insurgency
requires well-trained forces, which the U.S. can help provide to the
Mexican government, along with the equipment and technology allocated in
the Merida Initiative. The combination of attacking both the cartels and
the demand for their drugs will help burn the stick from both ends,
reducing their market and their structure to a point where it is much
less profitable for them to operate.]{.underline}

Executive Summary

[Mexico]{.underline}'s population [is living in a climate of generalized
violence and impunity, where gun homicides, torture, forced
disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and arbitrary arrests are
committed daily with no one held accountable]{.underline}. The country's
militarized security strategy and the [influx of firearms have had
devastating outcomes, including since 2006 more than 37,435 disappeared
persons, the discovery of more than 1,610 clandestine graves, and
121,035 gun homicides]{.underline}. In 2017 and the first half of 2018
gun homicide rates were the highest in Mexico's modern history.

Since the war against drug trafficking and organized crime was initiated
in 2006, the legal and illegal firearms trade to Mexico from the United
States has dramatically increased, with exponential increases in gun
homicides and serious human rights violations.

[Based on an analysis of responses to public document requests by the
Mexican military and other agencies, as well as other official reports,
this report provides further evidence of the **linkage between the
increased firearms trade from the United States Mexico and the dramatic
increase in gun homicides and violence in Mexico**]{.underline}. [Our
presentation]{.underline} and [analysis]{.underline} of data from both
national and international agencies and organizations [aim to explain
the role of firearms in the broader context in Mexico of violence and
impunity for serious human rights violations.]{.underline}

In a policy framework that led to the deployment of thousands of
soldiers for law enforcement and the use of lethal military force
against criminal organizations, [the United States has provided the main
firepower for this militarized strategy by selling an enormous and
growing quantity of firearms and firearm parts to Mexico]{.underline}.

This report synthetizes and analyses a wide range of information about
both the legal and illegal arms trade into Mexico. [While the United
States is the largest legal exporter of guns to Mexico, as well as the
principal source of illegally trafficked guns, the Mexican military is
the sole legal distributor and manufacturer of firearms in the country,
including to police.]{.underline} The report outlines specific cases
where there is evidence that **[firearms legally exported by the United
States were used to commit human rights violations.]{.underline}** The
study also points out the importance of transparency and national
control mechanisms for the effective regulation of firearm transfers.

Beyond the drastic rise in violence and role of U.S gun imports in the
violence, this report shows the impact that poorly regulated firearms
transfers have had throughout Mexico and their devastating effects on
public security. [We]{.underline} also [suggest alternatives for a more
transparent and efficiently regulated arms trade]{.underline} by both
countries. Based on our research, **[we recommend that]{.underline}**
Mexico and **[the United States reduce legal firearms exports to Mexico
to the amount before the war on drugs was declared]{.underline}**; to
**[establish effective criteria for legally exported firearm end
users]{.underline}**; to **[implement mechanisms to register, identify,
trace and monitor criteria of firearm end users; and to improve controls
and regulations for export and import licenses]{.underline}**.

[Many of the same policy recommendations often discussed to reduce gun
trafficking within the United States would likewise have an impact on
reducing trafficking across international borders.]{.underline}
Additionally, there are measures that would help law enforcement efforts
to combat international gun trafficking and shut off the illegal
pipelines that send guns across the borders.

[Institute universal background checks]{.underline}

Much has been written about the dangerous loophole in federal law that
allows guns to be sold in private transactions without a background
check and with no questions
asked.[48](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2018/02/02/445659/beyond-our-borders/#fn-445659-48) While
licensed gun dealers are required to conduct background checks before
completing a sale, under federal law, individuals who are not dealers
are free to sell guns without a background check. This gap in the law
allows individuals who are prohibited from gun possession to easily
evade that prohibition and buy an unlimited number of guns through
private, under-the-table transactions.

To date, 19 states and Washington, D.C., have acted to close this
loophole and now require background checks for all handgun
sales.[49](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2018/02/02/445659/beyond-our-borders/#fn-445659-49) While
it is difficult to establish a direct causal effect, academic research
finds that these states have notably lower rates of gun trafficking. A
2009 study used crime gun trace data from ATF to explore the link
between state gun laws and the rate of crime gun exports across states.
The authors found a significant link between the regulation of private
gun sales and lower rate of crime gun exports across
states.[50](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2018/02/02/445659/beyond-our-borders/#fn-445659-50) Additionally,
a 2010 analysis conducted by Mayors Against Illegal Guns found that
states that do not require background checks for all handgun sales at
gun shows have rates of crime gun exports that are more than 2.5 times
greater than states that
do.[51](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2018/02/02/445659/beyond-our-borders/#fn-445659-51)

Similarly, [closing this loophole and requiring a background check for
all gun sales---even those between unlicensed individuals---would help
to reduce illegal gun trafficking across the U.S. border.]{.underline}
Recently, [the percentage of U.S. firearms recovered in British
Columbia]{.underline}---a Canadian province bordering Washington
state---[decreased
significantly]{.underline}.[[52](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2018/02/02/445659/beyond-our-borders/#fn-445659-52) Canada's
National Weapons Enforcement Support Team attributes this trend to the
recently passed laws requiring background checks on all gun sales in
Oregon and Washington]{.underline}
state.[53](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2018/02/02/445659/beyond-our-borders/#fn-445659-53) Moreover,
the GAO found that traffickers that send firearms to Mexico often use
secondary markets such as gun shows---where private sellers often sell
guns without a background check in states that have yet to close this
loophole---to acquire and traffic
firearms.[54](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2018/02/02/445659/beyond-our-borders/#fn-445659-54)

[Make gun trafficking and straw purchasing federal crimes]{.underline}

One of the key gaps in current law, which enables both domestic and
international gun trafficking, is the absence of a federal law
specifically targeting the criminal conduct involved in illegally
trafficking guns. Under current law, individuals who knowingly
facilitate illegal trafficking by transferring multiple guns to
individuals prohibited from gun possession or through straw purchases
are often only able to be prosecuted for a paperwork violation. [The
lack of a dedicated and specific federal criminal offense for gun
trafficking and straw purchasing makes it difficult to focus enforcement
efforts on those individuals responsible for creating sophisticated gun
trafficking channels, which flood vulnerable communities on both sides
of the border with guns.]{.underline}

A number of high-profile law enforcement organizations support
strengthening the federal law with respect to gun trafficking and straw
purchasing, including the Major Cities Chiefs Association and the
International Association of Chiefs of
Police.[55](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2018/02/02/445659/beyond-our-borders/#fn-445659-55) A
number of bills have been introduced in the 115th Congress to address
these gaps in the law, including the Gun Trafficking Prevention Act of
2017,[56](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2018/02/02/445659/beyond-our-borders/#fn-445659-56) the
Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act of
2017,[57](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2018/02/02/445659/beyond-our-borders/#fn-445659-57) and
the Countering Illegal Firearms Trafficking to Mexico
Act,[58](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2018/02/02/445659/beyond-our-borders/#fn-445659-58) although
none have moved in committee or received a
hearing.[59](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2018/02/02/445659/beyond-our-borders/#fn-445659-59)

[Mandate the reporting of multiple sales of long guns]{.underline}

One of the tools that federal law enforcement agents use to identify
potential gun trafficking are reports from gun dealers noting when an
individual buys multiple firearms within a short period of
time.[60](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2018/02/02/445659/beyond-our-borders/#fn-445659-60) [Under
current federal law, licensed gun dealers are required to report to ATF
when someone buys more than two handguns in a five-day
period.[61](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2018/02/02/445659/beyond-our-borders/#fn-445659-61) However,
this statutory requirement does not apply to multiple sales of long
guns,]{.underline} such as rifles and shotguns.

In 2011, ATF attempted to partially fill this reporting gap in order to
address illegal gun trafficking to Mexico, using what is known as the
agency's demand letter authority to require gun dealers in the four
southern border states---Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas---to
similarly report to ATF when, within five business days, an individual
buys two or more semi-automatic rifles that are capable of accepting a
detachable magazine and are larger than .22
caliber.[62](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2018/02/02/445659/beyond-our-borders/#fn-445659-62) In
light of Mexican drug trafficking organizations' growing preference for
high-powered assault rifles, this reporting requirement is particularly
relevant in efforts to address international gun trafficking. However,
each year, there are efforts to attach a new restrictive rider on ATF's
budget to prohibit the bureau from requiring this additional reporting
in the four border states. Stand-alone legislation has recently been
introduced in Congress to similarly restrict this reporting
requirement.[63](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2018/02/02/445659/beyond-our-borders/#fn-445659-63)At
a minimum, Congress should reject these efforts aimed at eliminating
this important investigative resource for federal law enforcement, as it
helps to address illegal gun trafficking. Additionally, [Congress should
act to amend the existing statutory requirement to require all gun
dealers---not just those in the southern border states---to report
multiple sales of long guns in the same manner that they currently
report such sales of handguns]{.underline}, as proposed in the Multiple
Firearm Sales Reporting Modernization Act of
2017.[64](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2018/02/02/445659/beyond-our-borders/#fn-445659-64)

[Increase access to data related to international gun
trafficking]{.underline}

While ATF publishes annual reports containing aggregated data about
U.S.-sourced guns recovered in criminal investigations abroad, they
leave out crucial information that would help to inform public policy.
[More detailed information, such as the types and caliber of firearms
recovered, as well as a breakdown of which states supplied the guns
recovered in a particular country, would be useful for federal, state,
and local policymakers seeking to reduce both domestic and international
gun trafficking.]{.underline} ATF should make these data available as
part of its annual reports.

Moreover, while ATF has begun publishing reports that provide data on
the number of U.S.-sourced guns recovered in criminal investigations in
the 15 countries discussed in this report, [there is still a dearth of
information about the flow of U.S. guns to other nations.]{.underline}
For example, a recent study of more than 10,000 firearms seized by the
Federal Police of Brazil, found that around 1,500 of these guns
originated in the United States, making the U.S. the largest foreign
source of illegal firearms in
Brazil.[65](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2018/02/02/445659/beyond-our-borders/#fn-445659-65) [ATF
should increase international gun tracing efforts and publish
information about crime guns recovered in other parts of the
world,]{.underline} such as South American countries like Brazil and
Colombia. These countries present homicide rates of more than 25 per
every 100,000 people and are among the most violent nations in South
America.[66](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2018/02/02/445659/beyond-our-borders/#fn-445659-66)

[Reject efforts to weaken oversight of firearm exports]{.underline}

[One proposal currently under consideration by the Trump administration
would shift the responsibility of reviewing and approving the
exportation of small arms---handguns and many types of long guns,
including assault-style rifles---from the U.S. State Department to the
Commerce
Department.]{.underline}[67](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2018/02/02/445659/beyond-our-borders/#fn-445659-67) T[his
proposal has raised a number of concerns among national security and
human rights experts, who caution that such a move could weaken
oversight of these transactions and potentially open up the possibility
of these exported firearms being diverted into the hands of criminal and
terrorist organizations
abroad]{.underline}.[68](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2018/02/02/445659/beyond-our-borders/#fn-445659-68) In
September 2017, Sens. Ben Cardin (D-MD), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), and
Patrick Leahy (D-VT) sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Rex
Tillerson, expressing concerns about the proposal. In their letter, the
senators highlighted the risks posed when small arms end up in the wrong
hands: "As you are aware, combat firearms and ammunition are uniquely
lethal; they are easily spread and easily modified, and are the primary
means of injury, death, and destruction in civil and military conflicts
throughout the world. As such, they should be subject to more -- not
less -- rigorous export controls and
oversight."[69](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2018/02/02/445659/beyond-our-borders/#fn-445659-69)

In light of the high number of U.S.-sourced guns recovered in connection
with violent crime abroad, the current administration should consider
options for strengthening oversight of firearm exports rather than
weakening such oversight through a transfer of this responsibility to
the Commerce Department.

The May election will not produce a legitimate government. It may

predict.\[fn\]Crisis Group Latin America Briefing N° 36, Power without

But nor would a free election -- the prospects of which appear remote,
in any case -- be a panacea. Such a vote would have to take place as
part of a negotiated transition that provides a clear path back to more
representative politics and economic and social well-being, while
offering guarantees to those in government that could encourage them to
hand over power should they be defeated at the ballot box. [That means
negotiations, currently on hold, must resume]{.underline} but should
focus not only on electoral reforms but on wider steps to address the
political, economic and humanitarian crises. If they are to work[, they
should ideally be preceded by confidence-building measures, be backed by
international facilitation and feature a clearly established agenda,
timetable and rules.]{.underline} Sanctions are one of the few tools
available to bring the government back to the table and convince
opposition leaders that it is worth returning for further talks. Such
measures are rarely in themselves effective. But [the strong regional
and international consensus that exists on the gravity of the crisis
means that the threat of sanctions, combined with reinvigorated
diplomacy, is probably now the best shot at winning
concessions]{.underline} from the Maduro government. [Any sanctions must
be used sparingly and targeted]{.underline} carefully to avoid further
harm to a suffering population. To extend or broaden sanctions without
linking them to a realistic political strategy aimed at resolving or
mitigating the crisis would be counterproductive. Already Canada, the EU
and the U.S. have sanctioned figures in the government, imposing a mix
of asset freezes and travel bans on top Venezuelan officials, as well as
restrictions of arms sales and on investment in state-run companies. The
Latin American countries in the Lima Group could consider threatening to
follow suit. Peru has already taken the initiative to bar Maduro from
next month's Summit of the Americas in Lima, an important step to signal
regional opprobrium. The threat of even modest sanctions from Latin
American neighbours would be almost unprecedented in the region and
would thus send a powerful signal to Caracas. [Threats to impose
sanctions should be accompanied by clear demands as to the actions the
government would have to take to avoid such measures. These would start
with its return to talks with the opposition, but could include further
steps such as restoring political balance in key institutions, which
would mean opposition representation in bodies including the Supreme
Court and electoral authority; the release of political prisoners and
lifting of bans on opposition parties; as well as reforms that would
help address the economic crisis.]{.underline} The Lima Group should
also reach out to Venezuela's remaining allies, in particular Beijing,
in an effort to win their backing for a broad-based effort to resolve
the Venezuelan crisis. Though China has historically been reluctant to
exercise its influence in such a way, its interests, as well as those of
Venezuelans and the region, would be best served if it helped persuade
the Maduro government to negotiate seriously with the opposition. Its
significant financial and investment interests in Venezuela give it
considerable clout. Washington, which has been publicly dismissive of
the Chinese playing any such role, should adopt a more flexible
attitude. Without Beijing, the crisis will be harder to resolve. Most
urgent is to find a solution to the burgeoning humanitarian emergency.
This task must not be made contingent on a political settlement, nor
must the two issues be confused. The government says it fears that
humanitarian assistance will be used as a pretext for foreign military
intervention. These fears appear to be stoked by some in the opposition
who openly call either for an invasion or a "humanitarian
intervention[". It is entirely feasible for the government to work with
local and foreign NGOs and specialised UN bodies to channel medical and
food aid to those in need without providing cover for other
intentions.]{.underline} Not to do so is to condemn hundreds of
thousands of people to unnecessary suffering. In return, the UN,
regional governments and humanitarian groups should make clear that the
aid has no political strings and no goals beyond alleviating human
suffering. Venezuela's tragedy is entirely of human creation, the result
of ill-advised political and economic decisions and the determination of
individual leaders to hold onto power. [Venezuela has the resources,
natural and human, to recover, but it will not be able to do so
alone.]{.underline} If ever this crisis was a problem purely for
Venezuelans, that moment is past. [Regional governments and the wider
international community must bring to bear their diplomatic skills,
material resources and institutional capacity to help resolve it. The
longer the crisis persists, the worse it will get.]{.underline}

## \*\*Conditions CP\*\*

### 1NC

#### The United States federal government should condition reductions in Foreign Military Sales and Direct Commercial Sales of small arms and light weapons to Mexico on compliance with the Leahy Laws, permitting tracking and registering of arms after sales, and passage of security reforms to be determined by the U.S.

#### The CP solves human rights and Mexico says yes -- the US has key influence due to arms sales

**Epstein 1-29**-2019 -- (Louis Epstein, a junior at Brown University's
Watson Institute of International and Public Affairs, recently spent
several months working on the investigative team of the Mexican
Commission for the Defense and Promotion of Human Rights, a
U.N.-affiliated human rights commission, \"Mexican Security Forces
Commit War Crimes: Stop Arming Them,\" Foreign Policy In Focus,
<https://fpif.org/mexican-security-forces-commit-war-crimes-stop-arming-them/>)
// S.Y.

Americans might think of [Acapulco]{.underline} as a tropical idyll but
it's increasingly something different[: a homicide capital. U.S.
weapons, sold to Mexican law enforcement authorities ostensibly to help
combat criminals, are instead fueling violence, torture, disappearances,
and massacres.]{.underline}

[A new investigation by the Mexican Commission for the Defense and
Promotion of Human Rights (CMDPDH]{.underline}), a UN-funded human
rights watchdog, [has found that American guns sold to the Mexican army
are disappearing]{.underline} from armories [and being]{.underline}
[reported lost or stolen. I spent four months in Mexico working with the
commission]{.underline}'s investigative team, and [we concluded that as
many as 20 percent of the guns sold]{.underline} in some Mexican
states---more than 20,000 over the past decade---[have gone
missing]{.underline}.

Mexican authorities have trouble keeping track of the guns they buy. No
fewer than 342 disappeared from Acapulco's police armory before the
September raids. It's impossible to know what these guns have since been
used for, but the investigation found that more than 1,400 unmarked
graves have been unearthed across Mexico since 2007. These pits held the
remains of almost 2,000 victims, some in mass graves with more 80
bodies. More graves are found every month, and the total number of
victims of this violence is likely much higher.

The Mexican military is the only legal importer and vendor of weapons in
the country. It buys guns from American companies and then distributes
them to police forces and federal agencies. Because gun ownership in
Mexico is tightly controlled, most of the guns it resells go to state
and local police, who are notoriously corrupt and often collude with or
are infiltrated by drug gangs. Either by theft or graft, the 20 percent
of weapons that are "lost or stolen" tend to wind up in the hands of
criminals.

[In effect]{.underline}, then, [the United States is fueling the
violence in Mexico by providing the guns being used by both criminals
and the corrupt police who are failing to stop them. And the Trump
administration]{.underline}, eager to sell even more arms, [is seeking
to weaken the few safeguards that are in place.]{.underline}

The Example of Acapulco

Events in Acapulco show just how out of hand the situation has become.
Two of the city's police commanders were arrested for murder. The
situation got so bad that, in September, Mexican soldiers and marines
mounted a series of raids to disarm the city's entire police force.

Sadly, Acapulco is only the latest of more than a dozen cities and towns
where Mexico's federal government has had to step in to dissolve police
forces that became instruments of terror. Last year, there were more
than 30,000 homicides in Mexico, the highest number ever recorded.

American weapons have been used in some of Mexico's most gruesome mass
murders. In a case that has gripped Mexico since 2014, six students were
killed and 43 disappeared after police officers attacked their
bus---using Connecticut-made Colt AR 6530 rifles. In another case,
police officers in Tanhuato killed five people using Arizona-based
Dillon Aero mini-guns mounted on Black Hawk helicopters, built in
Stratford, Connecticut. In a third instance in Veracruz, police death
squads executed 15 innocent people after buying 674 firearms from Colt,
Bushmaster, and Combined Systems.

Trump's Response

[The **Trump** administration **has proposed** what could be **a
decisive weakening of the** already **ineffective system** by which the
United States controls small-arms sales to repressive security forces
**by shifting responsibility** for vetting these sales from the State
Department **to the Commerce Department**]{.underline}. [That would move
the process from a department with at least a formal commitment to human
rights to one whose priority is supporting American
businesses]{.underline}. The administration also wants to begin allowing
American gun makers to sell semi-automatic weapons without first getting
a State Department license. And the administration proposes to reduce
oversight of such sales by Congress. Although Congress is now notified
of commercial weapons sales worth over \$1 million under the Arms Export
Control Act, Trump's proposed changes would stop those notifications.

Senators Ben Cardin (D-MD), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Patrick Leahy
(D-VT) have criticized the proposed changes, but the National Rifle
Association and gun manufacturers have voiced their support for them.
(The Obama administration first proposed these changes, but reversed
course after several high-profile mass shootings.)

[In June, twelve members of Congress asked the secretaries of state and
defense for "a full and public evaluation" of U.S. security aid and arms
sales to Mexico, which they said has contributed to "a dramatic increase
in human rights violations." But without widespread concern from the
public and the press about the situation in Mexico, these policy changes
and the raging violence haven't been high priorities.]{.underline}

Research has shown that [limiting access to guns may reduce violence in
Mexico]{.underline}. A study from the University of
Massachusetts-Amherst found that [homicides rose 60 percent in Mexican
municipalities with access to American assault weapons compared to those
without it. Cutting off access to a source of guns makes it more
difficult for criminal groups to commit violent crimes.]{.underline}

Instead of loosening regulations on these arms sales, **[the United
States should begin tracking and registering the weapons that American
companies sell to foreign security forces.]{.underline}**

**[Washington should also begin using]{.underline}** an already existing
tool: **[the Leahy Laws]{.underline}**. [These laws ban the U.S.
government from assisting units of foreign security forces when there is
"credible evidence" that they have committed torture, extrajudicial
killings, or rape. But they have been loosely enforced]{.underline}.
From 2010 to 2016, as members of Mexico's security forces worked with
organized criminal groups to torture and execute innocent people, the
State Department approved the sale of 6,622 long guns and 4,571 handguns
to the Mexican army alone.

The incoming president of Mexico, [Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has
pledged to change the "failed" security policies of his predecessors.
He's called for UN help to stop corruption]{.underline} and promised to
allow an internationally backed truth commission to investigate the
disappearance of the 43 students. Considering that the previous Mexican
administration covered up brutal murders, this is a step in the right
direction.

[The **United States has more leverage** in this situation than you
might think. Though Mexico could buy guns elsewhere, **no other country
can match the United States as a strategic partner**.]{.underline}
[Mexico has received more than \$1.3 billion in American training and
equipment since 2012, and **the United States wields significant
influence because of this. Backing López Obrador's security reforms
would send a signal that the United States is getting more serious about
human rights in Mexico.**]{.underline}

By arming violent and corrupt organizations across the southern border
and beyond, America is undermining its own interests and security.
[Congress has both the power to demand more information about American
arms sales to Mexico and the ability to block the Trump administration's
efforts to loosen safeguards.]{.underline} U.S. security and thousands
of Mexican lives are at stake.

#### Russia has historically stepped in as US sales whither -- Boosts Russian economy, hurts US anti-narcotic efforts and ruins US sphere of influence

[Russia]{.underline}, a state where connections between state actors,
business interests, and organized criminals are heavily blurred, **[is
rapidly expanding its relations in Latin America in an effort to
undermine historic U.S. interests]{.underline}**, [as well as
rebuilding]{.underline}, in a limited form, [the alliances it had
constructed during the Soviet era. Russia's partners are primarily
highly criminalized states led by radical populist governments that are
**virulently anti-U.S. in their ideology**]{.underline}. Although
Russia's growing presence in Latin America does not pose an imminent
military threat to the United States, it is now an integral part of an
alliance of state and nonstate actors that have shown their hostility
toward the United States in their ideology, criminalized behavior, and
anti-democratic nature. [The high-level visits of senior Russian
officials and the pomp and statecraft surrounding them **are adept moves
to exploit the vacuum left as U.S. resources and attention have
withered**]{.underline}. [The expanding weapons sales not only bring
revenue to Russia's coffers, they offer the opportunity for long-term
military-to-military relationships, as the purchase of weapons systems
entails training, maintenance, and renewal.]{.underline} And [the police
and military training, particularly in the field of
counternarcotics,]{.underline} also offers several benefits: it
[challenges the]{.underline} preeminent [U.S. role in the region to
combat the flow of drugs to the United States; and it provides Russian
experts with access to a wealth of intelligence, logistical, and
military information across the region, including U.S. strategies and
tactics relating to counternarcotic and counterterrorism
activities.]{.underline} Additionally, [Russia's developing relations
with financial institutions not only assists Russia with avoiding the
consequences of sanctions, but it also provides a secure way for groups
such as state-linked cocaine trafficking groups in Venezuela, along with
the FARC and others, to launder their money through and with
Russia]{.underline}. One of the instruments the United States has
wielded effectively in its counternaroctics efforts is the freezing of
assets and following the financial trail. But once the money is in
Russia the financial trail will become even more difficult to follow.
Perhaps **[the most effective tool the Russians have deployed is the
creation of a counter-narrative to the United States]{.underline}**. Due
to the long history of U.S. heavy-handedness in the region and the
remnants of the radical movements that fought dictatorships and
repression in the 1970s and 1980s, the narrative resonates heavily.
[Russian official media]{.underline}, along with the official media of
the ALBA nations, [saturate Latin American airwaves and press with their
message, while a small army of authors and intellectuals, owned by
Russia]{.underline} and/or paid by the ALBA states, [write a steady
stream of books, articles, and pamphlets to reinforce the
message.]{.underline} [The cumulative effect of Russian efforts in the
region has been to win an important foothold, with access to resources,
deep-water ports, and airstrips while strengthening and prolonging the
radical populist alliance that is destroying the democratic process in
multiple countries**. It is an advance the United States cannot afford
to ignore any longer.**]{.underline}

and menetometric sensors and SIGINT suite, and a 360 degree monitoring

light homing torpedoes, 50 and 250 kilogram \[110 to 551 pound\]
anti-submarine bombs, heavy machine guns, and four external hardpoints
for an assortment of other weapons. The customizable package would
almost certainly be enough for fighting drug traffickers." [Sputnik
described the Seahawk's price, which it claimed to be \$170 million
apiece, as "hefty." But Sputnik was vaguer about the cost of a
Ka-27]{.underline}. "Details on the price of the gunship Ka-27s are hard
to come by, although a single Ka-27PV, the armed version of the Ka-27PS,
has an estimated price tag of \$14.5 million. The Russian defense
ministry\'s 2014 and 2016 outlays to modernize existing anti-submarine
warfare configuration Ka-27PLs came in at just over \$10 million
apiece." [Sputnik also praised the Ka-27 as being cheap to operate,
sturdy and reliable, and customizable for a variety of
missions]{.underline}. The helicopters are used by Russia's Border Guard
Service, as well as the Algerian, Chinese, Indian, Syrian, Ukrainian,
Vietnamese and Yemeni navies.

US. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein, returning from a trip
to Colombia, said over the weekend that [the Trump administration is
making a push to strengthen alliances across Latin America as part of an
effort to counter rising Chinese]{.underline} and Russian [influence in
the United States]{.underline}' backyard. In an interview with Foreign
Policy, Goldfein said Colombia and other Latin American countries risked
being locked out of U.S. and allied operations if they stopped buying
military hardware from the United States and turned to other markets
instead. "While there may be other cheap hardware out there that might
be available on the market, at some point it becomes really hard to make
it connect and share within the system," Goldfein said by phone Saturday
while flying home from Colombia. His trip was part of a broader
administration effort to reinforce alliances across Latin America as the
region grapples with a range of security threats, from narcotrafficking
and terrorism to Venezuela's economic collapse and ensuing refugee
crisis. During the two-day visit, which followed U.S. Defense Secretary
James Mattis's own [South America
tour](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/12/james-mattis-visits-south-america-amid-political-e/)
in August, Goldfein met with Colombia's minister of defense, commander
general, and air force chief, and he spoke with students at the
Colombian war college. "When it comes to China and Russia, we are
looking at cooperation where we can and pushing back aggressively where
we must," Goldfein said. "We keep a close eye on their activities
globally, but [certainly we keep an eye on]{.underline} their activities
\[in Latin America\]." Underlying the outreach effort, experts say, is
U.S. recognition that [China]{.underline} and Russia are quietly
[exerting economic and military influence in Latin America]{.underline}.
[China is a master at leveraging trade and direct economic investment
for geopolitical gains,]{.underline} they say. D[riven by a desire to
tap into Latin America's vast oil reserves, as well as to bolster
anti-American sentiment, China has invested large sums of money in the
region. It has
[surpassed](https://theglobalamericans.org/2017/07/shifting-trade-landscape-latin-america-favors-china-globalization/)
the United States as the main destination for exports in seven countries
in the region.]{.underline} In five of those countries---Brazil, Chile,
Cuba, Peru, and Uruguay---China is now [the]{.underline} largest [export
market]{.underline}. It [has also been]{.underline} working with
Argentina on a space station in Patagonia. "The Colombians are
[concerned that the U.S. has been leaving the region behind, and it has
created a void, this vacuum to fill,]{.underline}" said Moises Rendon,
an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He
noted Colombia's dilemma: [It "can't say no to China, because they are
providing opportunities and investment, \[while\] the U.S. is not
providing the same types of opportunities]{.underline}." Russia,
meanwhile, is seen as less of a power player in the region but has sold
billions of dollars of weapons to countries across Latin America. Unlike
China, which wants to use Latin America's natural resources for its own
economic growth, Russia's interest in the region is primarily strategic,
Rendon said. Both nations are using these commercial ties to support
Latin American regimes that violate human rights and are antagonistic to
the United States, particularly Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Bolivia, with
the end goal of undermining America's influence in the region, analysts
said. "[One very important concern for the U.S. government is that the
Chinese are propping up]{.underline} \[Venezuelan President Nicolás
Maduro's\] regime and other [nondemocratic leaders]{.underline} like
Nicaragua \[and\] Bolivia," Rendon said. Washington must help Bogotá
shoulder the burden of refugees. The escalation of Chinese influence in
Latin America is reflected in the number of nations that have swapped
recognition from Taiwan to China, according to Ana Quintana, an analyst
with the Heritage Foundation. This group now includes El Salvador, Costa
Rica, Panama, and the Dominican Republic. The goal is not just "sticking
it to the Americans," but also "amplifying their power," Quintana said,
noting the region's wealth of oil reserves. Both China and Russia "want
to be in a position to be a power broker in Latin America." The U.S.
administration's approach to countering Chinese and Russian influence in
Latin America is rooted in building new alliances and strengthening the
ones that already exist. [Maintaining strong military-to-military ties
is key,]{.underline} Goldfein said. "There are times when our diplomatic
relationships may change based on the political environment, but we are
able to maintain a military-to-military relationship and dialogue,"
Goldfein said. He stressed his close friendship with Colombia's Air
Force chief, Gen. Carlos Eduardo Bueno, and lauded the country for
leading the region in promoting democracy. "Colombia is really the gold
standard for how you take the resources of the country and, through
strong leadership and perseverance, you turn a country around and get it
on a path toward democracy," Goldfein said. Ensuring U.S. and Colombian
forces can operate seamlessly together involves not just frequent joint
exercises, he said, but also using interoperable equipment. For example,
the Colombian Air Force is a world leader in employing light attack
aircraft to fight drug traffickers, a practice the U.S. Air Force is
hoping to emulate against insurgents in the Middle East. The United
States has in recent years provided A-29 Super Tucanos, the same
aircraft the Colombian Air Force operates, to the fledgling Afghan Air
Force, and it is now looking to
[buy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/07/06/light-combat-aircraft/) that
platform for its own pilots. During the visit, Goldfein said, he and
Colombian leaders discussed partnership opportunities "to protect the
sovereignty of their airspace," including potentially selling Colombia
U.S. military aircraft such as F-16 fighter jets. Reinforcing U.S.
alliances in Latin America is also part of a "layered defense approach"
to protecting America's borders, Goldfein said. One current concern is
the crisis of Venezuelan migrants, who are pouring into Colombia at
rates of more than 4,000 a day. At the request of the Colombian
government, Mattis this fall sent the U.S. Navy's hospital ship USNS
Comfort to Colombia to provide medical care for the migrants.

#### China has already established a network in the region- they fill-in

[Similar to China's sharp increase in economic relations, it has also
significantly expanded its military engagement,]{.underline} effectively
creating opportunities to expand its arms market [in the LAC
region]{.underline}. However, little assessment has been placed on
China's emergence into the region's arms market, particularly how [that
emergence pertains to China's comprehensive strategy in building
influence and strengthening military partnerships]{.underline}.3 The
sale of Chinese arms has several implications for the LAC region. For
one, arms exports are a symbol of a country's position in the global
hierarchical system of arms production.4 Efficient arms production can
provide revenue and balance costs related to defense research and
development.5On a functional level, armies must procure arms that have a
maintainable life cycle. One can also argue that [arms exports are a key
component in a nation's foreign policy and can help secure influence, or
"soft power.]{.underline}" Simply put, the expansion of arms exports may
provide multiple benefits and can reflect a nation's interests abroad.
I[n Latin America, the increase in arms sales has complemented China's
goals of "securing access to natural resources and exports
markets]{.underline}."6 [It is important to note that China's
"complementing" differs from "facilitating." "If the latter becomes more
prominent, it may be a worthy indicator or warning of a significant
shift in the security environment.]{.underline}"7Given bureaucratic
hurdles in expanding a nation's defense industry to compete in the
global arms market, analyzing China's arms flows to Latin America can
provide further specific insight into the maturity of Sino-LAC military
relations. The most recent literature and data suggest [there is an
upward trend in Chinese exports to the LAC region, specifically in arms
exports]{.underline}.8 But, what are the drivers behind the remarkable
increase of Chinese arms exports to the region? In isolation, what
unique characteristics exist in the Sino-Latin American relations that
facilitated the increase in arms sales? This research intends to answer
those questions. The research and data from 2000 to 2016 demonstrate
that [as political and economic relations increased, Beijing's arms
sales also increased]{.underline}. A combination of factors including
the countries' ideological tendencies, particularly in the Alianza
Bolivariana para los Pueblos de Nuestra América (Bolivarian Alliance for
the Peoples of Our America, or ALBA) countries, and a comparative
advantage in defense products facilitated the increase in arms sales.9

[Where the state is absent]{.underline}, as in Michoacán and Guerrero,
[militias and self-defense forces have filled the vacuum, and these are
vulnerable to cooptation by criminal groups]{.underline}. López
Obrador's transition team has remained mostly silent about the future of
these militias, but [the new administration will have to address the
problem]{.underline}. In Michoacán and Guerrero, [self-defense forces
arrest people, hold extrajudicial trials, and mete out sentences. In
some towns, they have expelled local police forces and government
officials.]{.underline} Many militias have been implicated in murders as
well as extortion and illegal taxation. Yet the Mexican government has
shied away from disarming them for fear of violent confrontations and
because these self-declared people's defenders are sometimes locally
popular. [Finding an effective way to handle these militias has posed a
challenge for successive Mexican administrations]{.underline}. The Peña
Nieto government tried rolling some militia groups into something it
called the Rural Corps, a sort of supplemental, lightly vetted,
deputized police force. Many units refused to join.They continue to
engage in criminal activities, human rights abuses, and armed protests.
[López Obrador will likely face a similar problem with his amnesty
proposal. Some militia members, particularly those from indigenous
groups, may qualify for amnesty -- but what if they show no more
interest in it than they did in joining the Rural Corps? What about
those who accept the deal, but violate its terms and continue to act
illegally?]{.underline} Some self-defense groups and militias, including
those in Chiapas, engage in land theft and ethnic rivalries. To
effectively curtail such behavior would mean dismantling the groups and
punishing serious crimes with lengthy prison terms. But López Obrador
defines himself as an insurgent politician, fighting for the rights of
the indigenous and the downtrodden. Having personally engaged in
boycotts and protests and advocated extralegal behavior, such as not
paying utility bills, he may be sympathetic to such groups and their
methods. [Mexico needs strong oversight institutions and an empowered
civil society if it is to replace vigilante justice with the rule of
law. But with his disdain for institutions, the president-elect himself
may prove an obstacle to such improvement.]{.underline} THE DETERRENT
STATE Mexican citizens are rightly exasperated with the unrelenting
violence in their country. But [the incoming administration has raised
unrealistic expectations about just how much security will improve under
its watch]{.underline}: it has promised to reduce the nationwide
homicide rate from the current 25 homicides per 100,000 people to four
per 100,000 by 2021. [None of the policies that the administration has
proposed offer a clear path to this reduction. Amnesty would not be
available to murderers; socioeconomic policies take much longer than
three years to bear fruit; and so does police reform. The transition
team has yet to articulate a targeting or policing strategy. There is no
quick fix for eradicating violence in Mexico. At the moment, the
government lacks the required deterrence capacity to do more than secure
a temporary advantage for one among the country's many clashing criminal
gangs. The key to lasting security is to change that. If the Mexican
state is to credibly deter violent criminal activity, it needs a
comprehensive law enforcement strategy that goes well beyond the
decapitation of criminal groups.]{.underline} Socioeconomic policies for
fighting crime are a good idea, but they must be refined, sustainably
financed, and integrated with policing for a decade and more. The
federal and state governments should give all militias that do not
qualify as indigenous police a grace period to disarm and demobilize.
After that, the government must confront and arrest any militias that
haven't complied, while moving resolutely against new ones if they
arise. Militia members who have not been found guilty of murder,
kidnapping, or extortion should be considered eligible for the proposed
amnesty. [Mexico's federal government urgently needs a plan to recover
territories ruled or extorted by criminal groups,]{.underline}
regardless of whether or not poppy and marijuana cultivation are to
become legal in these areas. Without such a plan, legalization will fall
flat. [The state must supply security forces capable of protecting newly
legalized farmers and other businesses from extortion and of preventing
crops from being diverted to the illegal drug trade.]{.underline} And
licensing drug crops should not substitute for a robust, decades-long
investment in rural development and alternative livelihoods. For the
last twelve years, Mexico has seen violence decline only when one
criminal group temporarily wins enough turf and advantage to discourage
its challengers. These lulls are ephemeral and easily disrupted by
changes in the balance of power among criminal groups. [A lasting
security will come to Mexico only when the state has the capacity to
effectively deter criminals and secure the allegiance of local
populations.]{.underline} That's the objective for which the incoming
administration must strive.

#### AMLO defense strategy will embolden cartels -- the plan exacerbates the military's lack of funding and incentivizes police corruption

[Obrador's counter-cartel [policy

of amnesty, as well as his aspirations for a military reformation, will
only embolden the cartels]{.underline}. However, as he just took office,
it is important to wait and see what he and his cabinet will pursue and
the effectiveness of their policies. [Obrador]{.underline}'s amnesty
proposal, a way to attack cartel funding and offer a peaceful
alternative for certain low ranking and non-violent cartel members, [is
idealistic but naive]{.underline}. Vanda Felbab-Brown is a Senior Fellow
at the Brookings Institution and the author of [**[Narco Noir: Mexico's

critiquing Obrador and specifically focusing on [the problematic reality
of Mexico's lack of ability to adequately fund its programs, much less
its military]{.underline}. For example, she highlights President Nieto's
Social Prevention of Violence and Delinquency program, with its limited
success. Unfortunately, that success was not expanded, as the program's
funding ran out by 2016. Brown discusses targeting mid-level cartel
leadership instead of the top leaders as a means of preventing violent
successions of their rule. Her suggestion targets Obrador's platform of
amnesty for non-violent cartel members. This paper suggests that the
problem with both policy [proposals]{.underline} is that they [neither
adequately address nor combat the rampant established corrupt culture.
Poor farmers are unlikely to follow Obrador's deal as the cartel will
likely kill those who desert their ranks. Decades of sophisticated and
brutal violence is an established deterrent against idealistic
change]{.underline}. [Cartel leadership have the finances and the
manpower to regroup even if they purge their ranks of individuals who
might consider Obrador's deal. Instead, it would increase violence in
the region, shaking Obrador's and Mexico's ability to rise above this
further disintegrating environment.]{.underline} In conclusion, neither
President Obama nor the U.S. Joint Forces Command owe Calderón any
apology---a kleptocracy and a vast narco-economy rot Mexico's weak
institutions. [Continuous gun battles and the failing military and
police force raise concerns over Mexico's stability as a
state.]{.underline} [The power dynamic continues to shift where the
state continues to lose any monopoly on the legitimate use of
force]{.underline}, and there\'s a real possibility that Mexico can fail
as a state and one that is on the United States' border. The United
States needs to take a hard look at Mexico and treat it as a growing
security threat.

#### Mexico's military needs weapons -- they're key to fighting cartel violence

**Partlow 15** (Joshua Partlow, reporter, MS in journalism and MA in IR
from Columbia University, 6-15-2015, \"What's behind Mexico's military
buying binge?,\" Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/06/15/whats-behind-mexicos-military-buying-binge/)//ICH-EC

MEXICO CITY\--It started with 27 rail cars full of ammunition rolling
down the tracks into Mexico. That load of 30 million bullets was soon
followed by fleets of Black Hawk helicopters and thousands of Humvees:
in all more than \$1 billion of American military equipment sold to
Mexico within the past two years. [In a security relationship between
Mexico and the United States often described as standoffish, foreign
military sales have lately become a big exception.]{.underline} Admiral
William E. Gortney, the commander of Northern Command, the U.S. military
headquarters that deals with Mexico, testified to Congress earlier this
year that Mexico\'s buying binge represented a \"100-fold increase from
prior years.\" What explains the shopping spree? [Americans and Mexicans
familiar with the foreign military sales program said that **the change
in part reflects a revived security partnership** between the two
countries. **It also shows Mexico\'s aggressive push to modernize its
military in the face of powerful drug cartel adversaries.**]{.underline}
U.S. officials have hailed the sales in part because they\'re so rare.
Gortney, the Northcom commander, described Mexico\'s decision to
approach the Defense Department about buying military equipment as
\"unprecedented\" and that it marked a \"historical milestone\" in
relations between the two countries. Mexico\'s long been suspicious of
gringo motives (at least since it lost about half a million square miles
of its territory to the U.S. in the 19th century) and has tended to not
be a big U.S. military buyer, relying more on European equipment or
private commercial agreements. At the start of President Enrique Peña
Nieto\'s term more than two years ago, his administration felt the
United States had wormed its way too deeply into the drug war, and
Mexico halted many security programs. \"We knew that the President came
in really wanting to focus on things other than security,\" said a U.S.
military official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not
authorized to speak publicly. \"He found out he really needed to pay a
lot of attention to security.\" In late 2013, Mexico asked the United
States if it could fill a large order of 5.56 mm ammunition, and the
embassy helped deliver the trainloads of \$6 million worth of bullets
within 100 days, the official said. \"That case really kind of broke the
ice,\" he said. \"They saw the responsiveness of what we could do as a
partner in foreign military sales. And they liked it.\" That sale paved
the way for even larger purchases: orders for more than two dozen UH-60
Blackhawk helicopters for the Air Force and Navy, and more than 2,200
Humvees. Since Peña Nieto came to office in late 2012, Mexico has
purchased about \$1.5 billion in equipment through the government\'s
military sales program, plus \$2 billion more through U.S. companies,
said Inigo Guevara Moyano, a Mexican defense consultant based in
Washington. [\"All of these buys have been to replace existing systems
that averaged 30 to 40 years old and drained budgets through high
maintenance costs and poor availabilit]{.underline}y,\" he said. He
noted that defense spending also rose sharply under Peña Nieto\'s
predecessor, Felipe Calderon, and that it reflects the \"maturing
military-to-military relationship at the institutional level, regardless
of who is in power.\" [The buying also is a sign of the intensity of the
war against the drug cartels. **The Mexican military has aggressive
operations**]{.underline} ongoing in several states such as Tamaulipas,
on the Texas border, and Jalisco, against the ascendant New Generation
drug cartel. [These operations have driven a rapid increase in defense
spending]{.underline} over much of the past decade. Since 2006, spending
has tripled, from \$2.6 billion to \$7.9 billion this year. Despite the
growth, Mexico spends less than many other countries in the hemisphere,
just .51 percent of gross domestic product, compared to a Latin American
average of 1.31 percent, Guevara said. In addition to tactical raids and
statewide operations against drug cartels, the Mexican military is
involved in all sorts of other missions, from vaccination programs, to
reforestation, to securing voting booths in volatile parts of the
country, as it did last week. [The lavishly funded drug cartels it
fights are sometimes better armed and equipped than the security
forces.]{.underline} Cartel gunmen recently shot down a Mexican military
helicopter with a rocket-propelled grenade. [\"The Mexican armed forces,
including the Army, is one of the most overtasked military forces in the
world,\" said Alejandro Hope, a security analyst.]{.underline}

Drug Trafficking Organizations The [Mexican citizenry are caught in the
middle of a dangerous power struggle between the Mexican government, and
the drug trafficking organizations that are trying to protect their
illicit revenue as well as their routes into the United
States]{.underline}. Consequently, **[the most serious threat to the
security of the Mexican state is the drug trafficking
cartels.]{.underline}**11 The [DTOs]{.underline} that operate in Mexico
have [increasingly]{.underline} c[ommitted violent acts against the
Mexican government, most notably the police and military
forces.]{.underline} The actions by the Mexican DTOs are a result of
rival cartels vying for control of the drug trade; the violence that has
commenced has reached new levels over the past few years.12 In the
ensuing section of this thesis, I will expound upon the actions of the
various Mexican drug trafficking organizations, and their impact on the
national security of the Mexican state. The fierce fighting that is
playing out in the streets of Mexico is due in large part to the
aggressive policies of the Mexican President, Felipe Calderon. In
December of 2006, Mexico inaugurated Felipe Calderon as their President.
The new Mexican President vowed to fight the drug cartels that were
wreaking havoc on his country. To accomplish this task, Calderon has
deployed a total of 45,000 army troops and police officers into areas
controlled by the various drug cartels.13 Since the deployment of these
troops and the subsequent fighting that has taken place approximately
28,000 people have died.14 The President of Mexico believes that the
violence perpetrated by the drug trafficking organizations is a threat
to the state of Mexico.17 However, many past Mexican administrations
chose to either ignore the problem, or were complicit in the DTOs
activities. Consequently, the type and scope of the violence that is
inflicting Mexican society on a daily basis was largely minimal in past
years. This fact was due to the former Mexican administrations tolerance
of the various drug trafficking organizations, and their nefarious
deeds. In the 1950s through to the 1980s, the Mexican state had a system
of government which was extremely centralized in nature; this type of
system, and the individuals who encompassed it, were both sympathetic to
the drug cartels as well as protective of their various illicit
activities.18 The actions by the former Mexican governments provided the
various drug trafficking organizations with the opportunity to amass
immense power over the areas that they would eventually entrench
themselves in. The efforts exerted by the United States upon the cartels
of Colombia also provided Mexican DTOs with the needed cover to garner
more power in the illicit drug business. However, the changing
institutional policies in Mexico resulted in complications between the
drug trafficking organizations and the Mexican government. Mexico‟s rise
to democratic ideals and the political decentralization of power caused
difficulties for the various drug trafficking organizations that
heretofore had operated with government protection and acquiescence.19
Additionally, the strong and aggressive policies that President Calderon
implemented by sending federal troops into Mexico‟s most violent areas
ignited a reaction that has seemingly became an additional catalyst for
tremendous acts of violence throughout the Mexican state. [The ability
of the assorted Mexican drug trafficking organizations to inflict
violence on each other, as well as on innocent Mexican citizens, must
not be overlooked as it signals the erosion of the state‟s ability to
monopolize violence.]{.underline} The extent that drug trafficking
organizations will inflict violence in order to ensure their illicit
business practices was highlighted in a 2007 United Nations report
published by the National Institute of Justice on Mexico and the drug
trafficking problem. According to the report: Mexican drug trafficking
groups engage in a significant degree of violence (ranked 10 on a scale
of 1 to 10) in the areas of making use of violence generally, engaging
in violent behavior within the group (i.e., discipline, power struggles,
etc.), and using violence against other crime groups to settle disputes
or compete for territory or markets. [Mexican drug organizations also
use violence as a means to remove officials who hinder their
business.]{.underline} South of the U.S.-Mexico border, the violence
used to achieve these objectives has been characterized as brazen and
extreme, particularly among the chief drug trafficking organizations and
in cities along the northern border including Tijuana and Ciudad
Juarez.20 The violent capacities of the drug trafficking organizations
have elevated after the deployment of federal troops and police officers
to the DTOs areas of operation. The Mexican government is attempting to
disrupt the drug trafficking organization‟s operations by targeting them
directly. [Additionally, the]{.underline} drug trafficking [cartels are
beginning to align]{.underline} themselves [with each other. This
alliance building tactic is used to better protect themselves from rival
DTOs as well as the added ability to produce more arms and personnel to
fight the Mexican government]{.underline}. This arrangement between the
assorted DTOs creates increased pressure on the federal military forces
and Mexican police. [Large swaths of Mexico are essentially controlled
by the DTOs]{.underline}. Although a majority of the casualties of the
violence are members of these violent organizations, or somehow related
to drug trafficking, many ordinary Mexican citizens are affected by the
violence and carnage. Additionally, the instability and insecurity of
the Northern areas of Mexico have left many American cities at risk. In
a March 2009 article released by The Brookings Institute, author Vanda
Felbab-Brown states, "The number of kidnappings in Phoenix, Arizona, for
example, tripled from 48 in 2004 to 241 in 2008. Drug turf wars among
the drug trafficking organizations are beginning to occur in major
cities in the U.S., such as Dallas, Texas."21 This is an unnerving
negative externality of the narcotics problem occurring along the U.S.
southern border. Continued kidnappings and murders will persist until
the DTOs operating in Mexico are brought under control. As mentioned
previously, the various drug trafficking organizations operate
throughout the state of Mexico. Two of the largest DTOs, the Tijuana
Cartel and the Juarez Cartel are in close proximity with two major
American cities: San Diego, California and El Paso, Texas. Furthermore,
many of the drug trafficking organizations operate in conjunction with
each other. The figure below provides the current areas of the major
Mexican drug trafficking organizations. [The drug trafficking
organizations pose a serious threat to the security of Mexico. This is
due in large part to the blatant disregard many of the members of these
organizations have for the government of Mexico and its
citizenry.]{.underline} The Mexican government has implemented a tougher
stance against the various DTOs by deploying military forces; however,
the [drug trafficking organizations are heavily entrenched into the
society of the Mexican state.]{.underline} In a February 2009 article
from The Wall Street Journal, the [Mexican academic Edgardo Buscaglia
"estimates there are 200 counties in Mexico-some 8% of the totalwhere
drug gangs wield more influence behind the scenes than the authorities.
With fearsome arsenals of rocket-propelled grenades, bazookas, and
automatic weapons, **cartels are often better armed than the police and
even the soldiers they fight**.]{.underline}"23 The type of arms that
the various drug trafficking organizations own, the ability to control
large areas of the Mexican state, and the cultural entrenchment of these
organizations is disconcerting for the security of Mexico. In addition,
the drug trafficking cartels are beginning to elevate their deadly
attacks by implementing improvised explosive devices (IEDs) into their
assaults.

#### That results in WMD terrorism

[Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Violations of Mexican State
Sovereignty The possibility of foreign terrorist organizations using
Mexico as a base of operations for future attacks on the United States
would have major implication on U.S. national security. Foreign
terrorist organizations, most likely linked to Al-Qaeda, would have
greater freedom of movement in Mexico due to the lack of security in
that countr]{.underline}y. Organizations such as Al-Qaeda seem to move
from country to country preying on weak and chaotic states. The
government of [Mexico would be unable to sufficiently hamper the
activities of terrorist organizations]{.underline} due to a failed state
scenario. The Mexican military and police forces would have limited
leadership from the federal government which is needed in order to
confront terrorist organizations. [The lack of security
within]{.underline} the border of [Mexico would provide
terrorist]{.underline} [organizations with the needed cover to plan,
train, and conduct terrorist activities.]{.underline} This insecurity in
Mexico is in stark contrast when compared to the United States neighbor
to the north, Canada. In comparison, Canada has a viable, professional,
and proficient military, as well as, police apparatus that provide it
with the necessary tools to combat against foreign terrorist
organizations attempting to freely move within its borders. In addition,
the Canadian state is not actively fighting a prolonged conflict with
well-armed drug traffickers which hinder the Mexican military and
police. Terrorist organizations may attempt to use Canada‟s vast
territory in order to plan and train for an American attack; however,
the probability of success for the terrorist organizations when compared
to using Mexican territory is extremely low. Additionally, the United
States and Canada have a strong military history. Both countries
participate in the "bi-national command responsible for aerospace
warning, aerospace control, and maritime warning for Canada, Alaska and
the continental United States."90 In fact, a Canadian General was in
control of NORAD on the morning of September 11th 2001. This Canadian
General ordered the grounding of all commercial flights throughout the
United States. Terrorist have attempted to use Canada as a launching
point, as will be described below, however the use of its land by a
significant collection of individuals seeking to attack the United
States is highly unlikely. Consequently, terrorists that wish to do the
United States harm could seize the opportunity that may present itself
in Mexico to plan and equip for future attacks in the United States.
These organizations could use the porous border to infiltrate personnel
and material into the Southwest of America in order to facilitate
potential terrorist attacks. Terrorist organizations conducted these
types of infiltration activities before the devastating attacks on
September 11, 2001 as well as afterwards. On the eve of the millennium
in 1999 an Algerian man, Ahmed Ressam, attempted to transport a trunk
full of explosives over the British Columbia border in Canada into the
United States in order to bomb the Los Angeles airport.91 However, quick
thinking American border agent‟s employed sound law enforcement
procedures and arrested this individual before he was able to infiltrate
successfully into the United States. Additionally, the subsequent
questioning of Ressam also led to the appropriate handling of Richard
Reid‟s infamous shoe bomb that he attempted to use in order to destroy
an American Airlines flight in December of 2001.92 The attempted
infiltration by these terrorists should be a sign of concern for
American policymakers and law enforcement officials. The motivation and
expertise for many of these groups is apparent; however, the occurrence
may seem to many observers as an anomaly. This assertion would have
grave consequences for the American homeland as the infiltration of
Mexico by an assortment of foreign terrorist organizations may have
already begun. According to Ray Walser, a contributor to The Heritage
Foundation, [a prominent member of Hezbollah who goes by the name of
Jamel Nasr was recently arrested in the city of Tijuana.]{.underline}93
[Tijuana is extremely close to the large metropolitan city of San
Diego]{.underline}; additionally, Tijuana is inundated with drug
trafficking smugglers who are engaged in extreme acts of violence.
According to the author Ray Walser, the Hezbollah organization would be
interested in pursuing a relationship with the various Mexican drug
trafficking organizations.94 Walser articulated in his article that, "If
Hezbollah bag men can do business with Mexico‟s cartels, so can its
trained terrorists. In the fluid, globalized struggle based on the
principles of asymmetric warfare, terrorists constantly seek out our
vulnerabilities and soft targets."95 Terrorist organizations could work
unilaterally within a failed Mexican state or pair up with the various
drug trafficking organizations in order to accomplish their nefarious
operations inside the United States. One instance that draws attention
to the unilateral aspect of the various terrorist organizations focuses
on the Somali based Al Shabaab terrorist group. The United States
government designated Al Shabaab as a terrorist organization in 2008.96
This organization has aligned itself with the Al-Qaeda terrorist
network; and stipulated that it intends to do harm to the United
States.97 In early 2010, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued
an alert to Texas authorities asking them to "keep their eyes open for a
Somali man named Mohamed Ali who is believed to be in Mexico preparing
to make the illegal crossing into Texas. Officials believe Ali has ties
to Al Shabaab..."98 [The long and porous border between the United
States and Mexico is ideal for terrorists in their efforts to infiltrate
the United States.]{.underline} This fact becomes amplified with a
potential failed state scenario in the country of Mexico. Regrettably,
the abovementioned situation is not the only instance where individuals
linked to terrorist organizations have made attempts to infiltrate into
the United States, or are interested in doing so. According to the New
York Times the former Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, Admiral
James M. Loy, cited in written testimony, "[intelligence]{.underline}
that „[strongly suggests‟ that Al Qaeda operatives have considered using
the Mexican border as an entry point]{.underline}..." into the United
States.99 Additionally, Admiral Loy articulated that he had information
which suggested that many key Al Qaeda members would be able to pay
individuals in Mexico in order to infiltrate into the United States. 100
The ability in which terrorists could infiltrate the country of Mexico,
link up with various drug trafficking organizations, exchange money and
move into the United States is disconcerting. The assorted drug
trafficking organizations are an illicit profit-focused organization.
Ideology does not play a significant factor in their rationale. The
[DTOs would most likely facilitate the movement of terrorists into the
United States as long as they were compensated for their efforts.
T]{.underline}he realization of this occurrence by American officials
may impede the various drug trafficking organizations actions as they
would not want retaliatory actions by the United States against their
unlawful operations; however, the likelihood of American involvement in
Mexico due to a failed state situation may bolster the assorted drug
trafficking organizations to work with terrorist organizations
regardless of the consequences. Additionally, the mere assistance by the
drug trafficking organizations is only part of the problem. [A failed
state scenario in Mexico]{.underline}, one in which the Mexican security
forces were unable to protect their sovereignty, m[ay provide foreign
terrorist organizations with the needed cover to establish terrorist
training grounds where they could plan, train and initiate attacks
against the United States.]{.underline} This scenario is [not unlike the
environment that now encompasses the failed state of
Somalia]{.underline}. This situation is what sets our Northern border
country, Canada, apart from Mexico. It is unlikely that foreign
terrorist organizations could operate in Canada in the same capacity
that a failed Mexican state would provide. The rise of radical terrorist
organizations throughout the world is a serious issue related to the
national security of the United States. The numerous attacks targeted
against the American homeland, as well as, United States interests
abroad amplify the seriousness of the situation. The [growing
unrest]{.underline} in the country of Mexico [may be exploited by
various terrorist groups that wish to inflict harm on the United States.
The government of Mexico would be severely hampered]{.underline} in its
attempt to stymie not only the drug trafficking organizations of Mexico,
but also any terrorist organizations that wish to violate the
sovereignty of the Mexican state. Consequently, terrorist groups working
in Mexico would have the opportunity to either work unilaterally or
combine their efforts with the assorted DTOs in an attempt to smuggle
personnel and/or material across the border into the United States.
[Regrettably, the material that terrorist organizations may smuggle into
the United States could have devastating consequences if they are
successfully deployed within the country, namely n**uclear, biological
or radiological typed weapons.**]{.underline} In August of 2001, Osama
Bin Laden and his second in command, Ayman AlZawahiri, conducted
meetings with Pakistan‟s former specialists in uranium enrichment,
Bashiruddin Mahmood and Abdul Majeed.101 According to Mahmood, a former
highranking member of the Pakistani Atomic Energy Commission, Bin Laden
was extremely interested in acquiring nuclear weapons. 102 [The
acquisition of weapons of mass destruction by members of the Al-Qaeda
organization would be a **devastating** prospect for the United
States.]{.underline} As the attacks on September 11, 2001 demonstrate,
the leadership of Al-Qaeda is seeking the destruction of the American
state and are not hesitant in using weapons indiscriminately that will
inflict heavy losses. President Obama recently stated that if the
Al-Qaeda terrorist organization obtained nuclear weapons they "would
have no compunction at using them"103 President Obama went on to state
that "T[he single biggest threat to U.S. security, both short-term,
medium-term and long-term, would be the possibility of a terrorist
organization obtaining a nuclear weapon]{.underline} ... \[T\]his is
something that could change the security landscape in this country and
around the world for years to come."104 The issue of Al-Qaeda acquiring
a nuclear weapon is a concerning one; however, more disconcerting than
this assertion relates to the relative ease [members of this
organization could smuggle this type of material into the United States
for future attacks from the state of Mexico.]{.underline} The porous
border between the United States and Mexico offers seclusion and cover
to many drug trafficking smugglers as well as individuals who are
transporting human beings. It is apparent that various terrorist
organizations could use these same smuggling routes in order to
infiltrate the United States with dangerous weapons of mass destruction
type material. An additional threat to the American homeland from
terrorist organizations is attacks using radioactive material, more
specifically, radiological dispersal devices also known as „dirty
bombs.‟ [Terrorist organizations could smuggle rather easily radioactive
material from a lawless Mexico into the United States for potential
attacks.]{.underline} Radiological dispersal devices are used to
disperse radioactive material into the environment by using some type of
explosive device.105 The amount of material used in the bomb will
determine how many casualties are affected as well as the area of
contamination.106 The [material used in these bombs can cause tissue
damage, radiation poisoning, and cause mass panic within those who were
targeted for this attack.]{.underline}107 Terrorist organizations would
have the opportunity to use Mexico as a base for their operations; these
operations may include smuggling personnel into the United States or
smuggling WMD type weapons. The possibility of terrorist organizations
using personnel and material for attacks on the American homeland
intensifies the importance that Mexico remain a viable partner for the

coercive, sovereign power in all its relationships. **[Further security
collapse by the Mexican state will only bolster foreign terrorist
organizations]{.underline}** in their anti-American objectives. These
various groups could work with the drug trafficking organizations or
work unilaterally in order to infiltrate the United States or set up
terrorist training camps. This type of activity must be closely
monitored by American policymakers and law enforcement officials. The
next section of this chapter will deal with the economic costs to the
United States if the country of Mexico can no longer function as a
sovereign entity.

### War Turns Case

**(Nelia Sancho, Regional Coordinator for the Asian Women's Human Rights
Council, Gender & Catastrophe, p. 153¶ Conclusion: Women and War)**

The case of the comfort women is the most convincing argument against
war. By telling their stories, these women survivors tell in the
clearest terms possible the brutality and inhumanity that wars wreak on
people, but most especially women. [The [oppression that
women]{.mark}]{.underline} in Asia and the Third World [confront in
their lives, the [inequality]{.mark}, the [poverty]{.mark}, the
[discrimination]{.mark}, the [gender violence, **increase a
hundredfold** during]{.mark} times of war and [armed conflict,
when]{.mark} the ['normal' fabric of society is torn]{.mark}
asunder]{.underline}.¶ [[Women]{.underline}]{.mark}, who are [[seen
as]{.mark} weak and [vulnerable]{.mark}]{.underline}, and at the same
time bear their collectivities' honour and tradition, [inevitably
[become the **main targets** of armies]{.mark} bent on destruction and
annihilation of the 'enemy']{.underline} (Burke, 1994; 10). This is the
reason why [[whenever there is war, there are **rapes**
and]{.underline}]{.mark} other forms of [[violence against
women]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the war equation, men do the dirty work
-- they sell arms, they buy arms, they use arms -- and women are the
victims.

At this naked moment in the American experiment, when many people
perceive civilization on the verge of blowing up in some metaphorical
sense, there is an elderly man in California hoping to seize your
attention about another possibility. It is that civilization is on the
verge of blowing up in a non-metaphorical sense. William J. Perry is 89
now, at the tail end of one of his generation's most illustrious careers
in national security. By all rights, the former U.S. secretary of
Defense, a trained mathematician who served or advised nearly every
administration since Eisenhower, should be filling out the remainder of
his years in quiet reflection on his achievements. Instead, he has set
out on an urgent pilgrimage. Bill Perry has become, he says with a
rueful smile, "a prophet of doom." His life's work, most of it highly
classified, was nuclear weapons---how to maximize the fearsome deterrent
power of the U.S. arsenal, how to minimize the possibility that the old
Soviet arsenal would obliterate the United States and much of the planet
along the way. Perry played a supporting role in the Cuban Missile
Crisis, during which he went back to his Washington hotel room each
night, fearing he had only hours left to live. He later founded his own
successful defense firm, helped revolutionize the American way of
high-tech war, and honed his diplomatic skills seeking common ground on
security issues with the Soviets and Chinese---all culminating as head
of the Pentagon in the early years after the end of the Cold War.
Nuclear bombs are an area of expertise Perry had assumed would be
largely obsolete by now, seven decades after Hiroshima, a
quarter-century after the fall of the Soviet Union, and in the
flickering light of his own life. Instead, [nukes are
suddenly]{.underline}---insanely, by Perry's estimate---o[nce again a
contemporary nightmare, and an emphatically ascendant one. At the dawn
of 2017, there is a Russian president making bellicose boasts about his
modernized arsenal. There is an American president]{.underline}-elect
wh[o breezily free-associates on Twitter about starting a new nuclear
arms race. Decades of cooperation between the two nations on arms
control is nearly at a standstill]{.underline}. And, unlike the original
Cold War, [**this time there is a world of busy fanatics excited by the
prospect of a planet with more bombs---people who have already
demonstrated the desire to slaughter many thousands of people in an
instant, and are zealously pursuing ever more deadly means to do so.**
And there's one other difference from the Cold War: **Americans no
longer think about the threat every day.** Nuclear war isn't the subtext
of popular movies, or novels; disarmament has fallen far from the top of
the policy priority list.]{.underline} [The largest upcoming
generation]{.underline}, the millennials, [were raised in a time when
the problem felt largely solved, and it's easy for them to imagine it's
still quietly fading into history]{.underline}. The problem is, **[it's
no longer fading]{.underline}**. "Today, [the danger of some sort of a
nuclear catastrophe is greater than it was during the Cold
War,]{.underline}" Perry said in an interview in his Stanford office,
"**[and most people are blissfully unaware of this
danger."]{.underline}** It is a turn of events that has an old man newly
obsessed with a question: Why isn't everyone as terrified as he is?
"Today, the danger of some sort of a nuclear catastrophe is greater than
it was during the Cold War," Perry said in an interview in his Stanford
office, "and most people are blissfully unaware of this danger." "Today,
the danger of some sort of a nuclear catastrophe is greater than it was
during the Cold War," Perry said in an interview in his Stanford office,
"and most people are blissfully unaware of this danger." \| M. Scott
Mahaskey/POLITICO Perry's hypothesis for the disconnect is that **[much
of the population, especially that rising portion with no clear memories
of the first Cold War, is suffering from a deficit of
comprehension]{.underline}**. **[Even a single nuclear explosion in a
major city would represent an abrupt and possibly irreversible turn in
modern life, upending the global economy, forcing every open society to
suspend traditional liberties and remake itself into a security
state.]{.underline}** "The political, economic and social consequences
are beyond what people understand," Perry says. And yet [many people
place this scenario in roughly the same category as the meteor strike
that supposedly wiped out the dinosaurs---frightening, to be sure, but
something of an abstraction.]{.underline} So Perry regards his last
great contribution of a 65-year career as a crusade to stimulate the
public imagination---to share the vivid details of his own nightmares.
He is doing so in a recent memoir, in a busy public speaking schedule,
in half-empty hearing rooms on Capitol Hill, and increasingly with an
online presence aimed especially at young people. He has enlisted the
help of his 28-year-old granddaughter to figure out how to engage a new
generation, including through a series of virtual lectures known as a
MOOC, or massive open online course. He is eagerly signing up for "Ask
Me Anything" chats on Reddit, in which some people still confuse him
with William "The Refrigerator" Perry of NFL fame. He posts his
ruminations on YouTube, where they give Katy Perry no run for her money,
even as the most popular are closing in on 100,000 views. One of the
**[nightmare scenarios]{.underline}** Perry invokes most often is
designed to roust policymakers who live and work in the nation's
capital. [The terrorists would need enriched uranium.]{.underline} Due
to the elaborate and highly industrial nature of production, hard to
conceal from surveillance, fissile material is still hard to come
by---but, alas, far from impossible. [Once it is procured, with help
from conspirators in a poorly secured overseas commercial power
centrifuge facility, the rest of the plot as Perry imagines it is no
great technological or logistical feat]{.underline}. **[The mechanics of
building a crude nuclear device are easily within the reach of
well-educated and well-funded militants.]{.underline}** The crate would
arrive at Dulles International Airport, disguised as agricultural
freight. The truck bomb that detonates on Pennsylvania Avenue between
the White House and Capitol instantly kills the president, vice
president, House speaker, and 80,000 others. Where exactly is your
office? Your house? And then, as Perry spins it forward, **[how credible
would you find the warnings, soon delivered to news networks, that five
more bombs are set to explode in unnamed U.S. cities]{.underline}**,
once a week for the next month, unless all U.S. military personnel
overseas are withdrawn immediately? If this particular scenario does not
resonate with you, Perry can easily rattle off a long roster of
others---a **[regional war that escalates into a nuclear exchange, a
miscalculation between Moscow and Washington, a computer glitch at the
exact wrong moment]{.underline}**. They are all ilks of the same
theme---the dimly understood threat that the science of the 20th century
is set to collide with the destructive passions of the 21st. "We're
going back to the kind of dangers we had during the Cold War," Perry
said. "I really thought in 1990, 1991, 1992, that we left those behind
us. [We're starting to re-invent them]{.underline}. [We and the Russians
and others don't understand that what we're doing is re-creating those
dangers---or maybe they don't remember the dangers. For younger people,
they didn't live through those dangers]{.underline}. But when you live
through a Cuban Missile Crisis up close and you live through a false
alarm up close, you do understand how dangerous it is, and you believe
you should do everything you could possibly do to \[avoid\] going back."
\*\*\* For people who follow the national security priesthood, the dire
scenarios are all the more alarming for who is delivering them. Through
his long years in government Perry invariably impressed colleagues as
the calmest person in the room, relentlessly rational, such that people
who did not know him well---his love of music and literature and
travel---regarded his as a purely analytical mind, emotion subordinated
to logic and duty. Starting in the 1950s as a technology executive and
entrepreneur in some of the most secretive precincts of the defense
industry, he gradually took on a series of high-level government
assignments that gave him one of the most quietly influential careers of
the Cold War and its aftermath. Fifteen years before serving as Bill
Clinton's secretary of defense, Perry was the Pentagon official in
charge of weapons research during the Carter administration. It was from
this perch that he may have had his most far-reaching impact, and left
him in some circles as a legendary figure. He used his office to give an
essential push to two ideas that transformed warfare over the next
generation decisively to American advantage. One idea was stealth
technology, which allowed U.S. warplanes to fly over enemy territory
undetected. The other was precision-guided munitions, which allowed U.S.
bombs to land with near-perfect accuracy. During the Clinton years,
Perry so prized his privacy that he initially turned down the job of
Defense secretary---changing his mind only after Clinton and Al Gore
pleaded with him that the news media scrutiny wouldn't be so bad. Left:

over a life in the public sphere is starkly at odds with this latest
highly impassioned chapter of Perry's career. Harold Brown, who also is
89, first recruited Perry into government, and was Perry's boss while
serving as Defense secretary in the Carter years. "No one would have
thought of Bill Perry as a crusader," he says. "But he is on a crusade."
Lee Perry, his wife of nearly 70 years, is living in an elder care
facility, her once buoyant presence now lost to dementia. Perry himself,
lucid as ever, has seen his physical frame become frail and stooped.
Rather than slowing his schedule, he has accelerated his travels to
plead with people to awaken to the danger. A trip to Washington includes
a dinner with national security reporters and testimony on Capitol Hill.
Back home in California, he's at the Google campus to prod engineers to
contemplate that their world may not last long enough for their dreams
of technology riches to come true. He's created an advocacy group, the
William J. Perry project, devoted to public education about nuclear
weapons. He's enlisted both his granddaughter and his 64-year-old
daughter, Robin Perry, in the cause. But if his profile is rising, his
style is essentially unchanged. He is a man known for self-effacement,
trying to shape an era known for relentless self-promotion, a voice of
quiet precision in a time of devil-take-the-hindmost bombast. The
rational approach to problem-solving that propelled his career and won
him adherents and friends in both political parties and even among some
of America's erstwhile enemies remains his guide---in this case, by
endeavoring to calculate the possibilities and probabilities of a
terrorist attack, regional nuclear war, or horrible miscalculation with
Russia. "I want to be very clear," he said. "I do not think it is a
probability this year or next year or anytime in the foreseeable future.
[But the consequence is so great, we have to take it seriously. And
there are things to greatly lower those possibilities that we're simply
not doing."]{.underline} \*\*\* Perry really did not expect he would
have to write this chapter of his public life. His official career
closed with what seemed then an unambiguous sense of mission
accomplished. By the time he arrived in the Pentagon's top job in 1994,
the Cold War was over, and the main item on the nuclear agenda seemed to
be cleaning up no-longer-needed arsenals. As defense secretary, Perry
stood with his Russian counterpart, Pavel Grachev, as they jointly blew
up missile silos in the former Soviet Union and tilled sunflower seeds
in the dirt. "I finally thought by the end of the '80s we lived through
this horrible experience and it's behind us," Perry said. "When I was
secretary, I fully believed it was behind us." After leaving the
Pentagon, he accepted an assignment from Clinton to negotiate an end to
North Korea's nuclear development program---and seemed agonizingly close
to a breakthrough as the last days of the president's term expired. Now,
he sees his grandchildren inheriting a planet possibly more dangerous
than it was during his public career. [No one could doubt that the Sept.
11 terrorists would have gladly used nuclear bombs instead of airplanes
if they had had them, **and it seems only a matter of time until they
try.** Instead of a retreating threat in North Korea, that fanatical
regime now possesses as many as eight nuclear bombs, and is just one
member of a growing nuclear club.]{.underline} Far from a new
partnership with Russia, Vladimir [Putin has given old antagonisms a
malevolent new face. American policymakers talk of spending up to \$1
trillion to modernize the nuclear arsenal. And now comes Donald Trump
with a long trail of statements effectively shrugging his shoulders
about a world newly bristling with bombs and people with reasons to use
them.]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir Putin (left) and North

knew Hillary Clinton well professionally, and says he admired both her
and Bill Clinton for their professional judgment though he was never a
personal intimate of either. He was prescient before the election in
expressing skepticism about how voters would respond to the dynastic
premise of the Clinton campaign---a healthy democracy should grow new
voices---but was as surprised as everyone else on Election Day. Donald
Trump was not the voice he was looking for, to put it mildly, but he has
responded to the Trump cyclone with modulated restraint. Perry said he
assumes his most truculent rhetoric isn't serious, the utterances of a
man who assumed his words were for political effect only and had no real
consequences. Now that they do, Perry is hoping to serve as a kind of
ambassador to rationality. He said he is hoping for audiences soon, with
Trump if the incoming president will see him, and certainly Trump's
national security team, which includes several people Perry knows,
including Defense Secretary nominee James Mattis. There is little doubt
the message if the meeting comes. "We are starting a new Cold War," he
says. "We seem to be sleepwalking into this new nuclear arms race. ...
We and the Russians and others don't understand what we are doing." "I
am not suggesting that this Cold War and this arms race is identical to
the old one," Perry added. "But in many ways, it is just as bad, just as
dangerous. And totally unnecessary." \*\*\* Perry had been brooding over
the question for a year. It was in the early 1950s, he was still in his
20s, and the subject was partial differential equations---the topic of
his Ph.D. thesis. A particular problem had been absorbing him, day in
and day out, hours and hours on end. Then, out of nowhere, a light came
on. Math for Perry represented analytical discipline, a way of achieving
mastery not only over numerical problems but any hard problem, by
breaking it down into essential parts, distilling complexity into
simplicity. Math for Perry represented analytical discipline, a way of
achieving mastery not only over numerical problems but any hard problem,
by breaking it down into essential parts, distilling complexity into
simplicity. \| Photo via the William J. Perry Project "I woke up in the
middle of the night, and it was all there," Perry recalled. "It was all
there, and I got out of bed and sat down. The next two or three hours, I
wrote my thesis, and from the first word I wrote down, I never doubted
what the last word was going to be: It was a magic moment." The story is
a reminder of something definitional about Bill Perry. Before he became
in recent years an apostle of disarmament, before he sat atop the
nation's war-making apparatus in the 1990s, before he was the executive
of a defense contractor specializing in the most complex arenas of Cold
War surveillance in the 1960s, he was a young man in love with
mathematics. In those days, Perry had planned on a career as a math
professor. His attraction to math was not merely practical, in the way
that engineers or architects rely on math. The appeal was just as much
aesthetic, in ways that people who are not numbers people---political
life tends to be dominated by word people---cannot easily comprehend. To
Perry's mind, there was a purity to math, a beauty to the patterns and
relationships, that was not unlike music. Math for Perry represented
analytical discipline, a way of achieving mastery not only over
numerical problems but any hard problem, by breaking it down into
essential parts, distilling complexity into simplicity. This trait was
why Pentagon reporters in the 1990s liked spending time around Perry.
When most public officials are asked a question, one studies the
transcript later to decipher a succession of starts and stalls, sentence
fragments and ellipses, that cumulatively convey an impressionistic
sense of mind but no clear fixed meaning. Perry's sentences, by
contrast, always cut with surgical precision. It was one reason Clinton
White House officials often held their breath when he gave
interviews---Perry might make news by being clear on subjects, such as
ethnic warfare in the Balkans or a nuclear showdown in North Korea, that
the West Wing preferred to try to fog over. "I've never been able to
attack a policy problem with a mathematical formula," he recalled, "but
I have always believed that the rigorous way of thinking about a problem
was good. It separated the fact from the bullshit, and that's very
important sometimes, to separate what you can from what you would hope
you can do." [Just how high is the risk? The answer is ultimately
unknowable]{.underline}. Perry's point, though[, is that it's a hell of
a lot higher than you think.]{.underline} Just how high is the risk? The
answer is ultimately unknowable. Perry's point, though, is that it's a

[Perry wishes more people were familiar with the concept of "expected
value." That is a statistical way of understanding events of very large
magnitude that have a low probability.]{.underline} The large magnitude
event could be something good, like winning a lottery ticket. Or it
could be something bad, like a nuclear bomb exploding. Because the odds
of winning the lottery are so low, the rational thing is to save your
money and not buy the ticket. As [for a nuclear explosion]{.underline},
by Perry's lights, **[the consequences are so grave that the rational
thing would be for people in the United States and everywhere to be in a
state of peak alarm about their vulnerability, and for political debate
to be dominated by discussion of how to reduce the risk.]{.underline}**
And just how high is the risk? The answer of course is ultimately
unknowable. Perry's point, though, is that it's a hell of a lot higher
than you think. Perry invites his listeners to consider all the various
scenarios that might lead to a nuclear event. "Mathematically speaking,
you add those all together in one year it is still just a possibility,
not a probability," he reckons. "But then you go out ten, twenty years
and each time this possibility repeats itself, and then it starts to
become a probability. How much time we have to get those possibility
numbers lower, I don't know. But sooner or later the odds are going to
get us, I am afraid." \*\*\* Almost uniquely among living Americans,
Bill Perry has actually faced down the prospect of nuclear war
before---twice. In the fall of 1962, Bill Perry was 35, father of five
young children, living in the Bay Area and serving as director of
Sylvania's Electronic Defense Laboratories---driving his station wagon
to recitals in between studying missile trajectories and the radius of
nuclear detonations. Where he resided was not then called Silicon
Valley, but the exuberance and spirit of creative possibility we now
associate with the region was already evident. The giants then were Bill
Hewlett and David Packard, men Perry deeply admired and wished to
emulate in his own business career. The innovation engine at that time,
however, was not consumer technology; it was the government's appetite
for advantage in a mortal struggle against a powerful Soviet foe. Perry
was known as a star in the highly complex field of weapons surveillance
and interpretation. So it was not a surprise, one bright October day,
for Perry to get a call from Albert "Bud" Wheelon, a friend at the
Central Intelligence Agency. Wheelon said he wanted Perry in Washington
for a consultation. Perry said he'd juggle his schedule and be there the
next week. "No," Wheelon responded. "I need to see you right away."
Perry caught the red-eye from San Francisco, and went straight to the
CIA, where he was handed photographs whose meaning was instantly clear
to him. They were of Soviet missiles stationed in Cuba. For the next
couple weeks, Perry would stay up past midnight each evening poring over
the latest reconnaissance photos and help write the analysis that senior
officials would present the next morning to President Kennedy. Perry
experienced the crisis partly as ordinary citizen, hearing Kennedy on
television draw an unambiguous line against Soviet missiles in this
hemisphere and promising that any attack would be met with "a full
retaliatory response." But he possessed context, about the capabilities
of weapons and the daily state of play in the crisis, that gave him a
vantage point superior to that of all but perhaps a few dozen people. "I
was part of a small team---six or eight people," he recounted of those
days 54 years earlier. "Half of them technical experts, half of them
intelligence analysts, or photo interpreters. It was a minor role but I
was seeing all the information coming in. I thought every day when I
went back to the hotel it was the last day of my life because I knew
exactly what nuclear weapons could do. I knew it was not just a lot of
people getting killed. It was the end of civilization and I thought it
was about to happen." Left: A January 1963 aerial photo showing that the

Missile Crisis. \| Defense Department; Carl Mydans/The LIFE Picture
Collection/Getty Images It was years later that Perry, like other more
senior participants in the crisis, learned how right that appraisal was.
Nuclear bombs weren't only heading toward Cuba on Soviet ships, as
Kennedy believed and announced to Americans at the time. Some of them
were already there, and local commanders had been given authority to use
them if Americans launched a preemptive raid on Cuba, as Kennedy was
being urged, goaded even, by Air Force Gen. Curtis LeMay and other
military commanders. At the same time, Soviet submarines were armed and
one commander had been on the verge of launching them until other
officers on the vessel talked him out of it. Either event would have in
turn sent U.S. missiles flying. The Cuban Missile Crisis recounting is
one of the dramatic peaks in "My Journey on the Nuclear Brink," the
memoir Perry published last fall. It is a book laced with other close
calls---like November 9, 1979, when Perry was awakened in the middle of
the night by a watch officer at the North American Aerospace and Defense
Command (NORAD) reporting that his computers showed 200 Soviet missiles
in flight toward the United States. For a frozen moment, Perry thought:
This is it---This is how it ends. The watch officer soon set him at
ease. It was a computer error, and he was calling to see whether Perry,
the technology expert, had any explanation. It took a couple days to
discover the low-tech answer: Someone had carelessly left a
crisis-simulation training tape in the computer. All was well. But what
if this blunder had happened in the middle of a real crisis, with
leaders in Washington and Moscow already on high alert? The inescapable
conclusion was the same as it was in 1962: The world skirting nuclear
Armageddon as much by good luck as by skilled crisis management. Perry
is part of a distinct cohort in American history, one that didn't come
home with the large-living ethos of the World War II generation, but
took responsibility for cleaning up the world that the war bequeathed.
He was a 14-year-old in Butler, Pennsylvania when he heard the news of
the Pearl Harbor attack in a friend's living room, and had the
disappointed realization that the war might be over by the time he was
old enough to fight in it. That turned out to be true---he was just shy
of 18 at war's end---a fact that places Perry in what demographers have
called the "Silent Generation," too young for one war but already
middle-aged by the time college campuses erupted over Vietnam. Like many
in his generation, Perry was not so much silent as deeply dutiful, with
an understated style that served as a genial, dry-witted exterior to a
life in which success was defined by how faithfully one met his
responsibilities. Perry said he became aware, first gradually and over
time profoundly, of the surreal contradictions of his professional life.
His work---first at Sylvania and then at ESL, a highly successful
defense contracting firm he co-founded in 1963---was relentlessly
logical, analyzing Soviet threats and intentions and coming up with
rational responses to deter them. But each rational move was part of a
supremely irrational dynamic---"mutually assured destruction"---that
placed the threat of massive casualties at the heart of America's basic
strategic thinking. It was the kind of framework in which policymakers
could accept that a mere 25 million people dead was good news. Also the
kind that in one year alone led the United States to produce 8,000
nuclear bombs. By the end, the Cold War left the planet with about
70,000 bombs (a total that is now down to about 15,500). "[I think
probably everybody who was involved in nuclear weapons in those days
would see the two sides of it," Perry recalls, "the logic of deterrence
and the madness of deterrence, and there was no mistake, I think, that
the acronym was MAD."]{.underline} \*\*\* Perry has been at the
forefront of a movement that he considers the sane and only alternative,
and he has joined forces with other leading Cold Warriors who in another
era would likely have derided their vision as naïve. In January 2007, he
was a co-author of a remarkable commentary that ran on the op-ed page of
the Wall Street Journal. It was signed also by two former secretaries of
state, George Schulz and Henry Kissinger and by Sam Nunn, a former
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee---all leading military
hawks and foreign policy realists who came together to argue for
something radical: that the goal of U.S. policy should be not merely the
reduction and control of atomic arms, it should be the ultimate
elimination of all nuclear weapons. This sounded like gauzy utopianism,
especially bizarre coming from supremely pragmatic men. But Perry and
the others always made clear they were describing a long-term ideal, one
that would only be achieved through a series of more incremental steps.
The vision was stirring enough that it was endorsed by President Obama
in his opening weeks in office, in a March 2009 address in Prague. In
retrospect, Obama's speech may have been the high point for the vision
of abolition. "A huge amount of progress was made," recalled Shultz, now
93. "Now it is going in the other direction." "We have less danger of an
all-out war with Russia," in Nunn's view. "[But we have more danger of
some type of accident, miscalculation, cyber interference, a terrorist
group getting a nuclear weapon]{.underline}. **[It requires a lot more
attention than world leaders are giving it."]{.underline}** Perry's goal
now is much more defensive than it was just a few years ago---halting
what has become inexorable momentum toward reviving Cold War assumptions
about the central role of nukes in national security. More recently he's
added yet another recruit to his cause: California Governor Jerry Brown.
Brown, now 78, met Perry a year ago, after deciding that he wanted to
devote his remaining time in public service mainly to what he sees as
civilization's two existential issues, climate change and nuclear
weapons. Brown said he became fixated on spreading Perry's message after
reading his memoir: He recently gave a copy to President Obama and is
trying to bend the ear of others with influence in Washington. If Bill
Perry has a gift for understatement, Brown has a gift for the
theatrical. In an interview at the governor's mansion in Sacramento, he
wonders why everyone is not paying attention to his new friend and his
warnings for mankind. "He is at the brink! At the brink! Not WAS at the
brink---IS at the brink," Brown exclaimed. "But no one else is." A
California governor can have more influence, at least indirectly, than
one might think, due to the state's outsized role in policy debates and
the fact that the University of California's Board of Regents helps
manage some of the nation's top weapons laboratories, which study and
design nuclear weapons. Brown, who was a vocal critic in the 1980s of
what he called America\'s \"nuclear addiction,\" reviewed Perry\'s
recent memoir in the New York Review of Books, and said he is determined
to help his new friend spread his message. "Everybody is, \'we are not
at the brink,\' and we have this guy Perry who says we are. It is the
thesis that is being ignored.\" Even if more influential people wake up

Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO This is where Perry's pragmatism comes back into
play. The smartest move, he thinks, is to eliminate the riskiest part of
the system. If we can't eliminate all nukes, Perry argues, we could at
least eliminate one leg of the so-called nuclear triad, intercontinental
ballistic missiles. These are especially prone to an accidental nuclear
war, if they are launched by accident or due to miscalculation by a
leader operating with only minutes to spare. Nuclear weapons carried by
submarines beneath the sea or aboard bomber planes, he argues, are
logically more than enough to deter Russia. The problem, he knows, is
that logic is not necessarily the prevailing force in political debates.
Psychology is, and this seems to be dictating not merely that we deter a
Russian military force that is modernizing its weapons but that we have
a force that is self-evidently superior to them. It is an argument that
strikes Perry as drearily familiar to the old days. Which leads him the
conclusion that **[the only long-term way out is to persuade a younger
generation to make a different choice.]{.underline}** His granddaughter,
Lisa Perry, is precisely in the cohort he needs to reach. At first she
had some uncomfortable news for her grandfather: Not many in her
generation thought much about the issue. "**[The more I learned from him
about nuclear weapons the more concerned I was that my generation had
this massive and dangerous blind spot in our understanding of the
world]{.underline}**," she said in an interview. "**[Nuclear weapons are
the biggest public health issue I can think of."]{.underline}** But she
has not lost hope that their efforts can make a difference, and today
she has put her graduate studies in public health on hold to work full
time for the Perry Project as its social media and web manager. "It can
be easy to get discouraged about being able to do anything to change our
course," she said. ["But the good news is that nuclear weapons are
actually something that we as humans can control\...but first we need to
start the conversation."]{.underline} It was with her help that Perry
went on Reddit to field questions ranging from how his PhD in
mathematics prepared him to what young people need to understand. "As a
90s baby I never lived in the Cold War era," wrote one participant, with
the Reddit username BobinForApples. "What is one thing today\'s
generations will never understand about life during the Cold War?" Perry
answered, as SecDef19: "Because you were born in the 1990s, **[you did
not experience the daily terror of 'duck and cover']{.underline}**
drills as my children did. Therefore [the appropriate fear of nuclear
weapons is not part of your heritage, but the danger is just as real now
as it was then. It will be up to your generation to develop the policies
to deal with the deadly nuclear legacy that is still very much with
us."]{.underline} For the former defense secretary, the task now is to
finally---belatedly---prove Einstein wrong. The physicist said in 1946:
"The unleashed power of the atom has changed everything save our modes
of thinking and we thus drift toward unparalleled catastrophe." In
Perry's view the only way to avoid it is by directly contemplating
catastrophe---and doing so face to face with the world's largest nuclear
power, Russia, as he recently did in a forum in Luxembourg with several
like-minded Russians he says are brave enough to speak out about nuclear
dangers in the era of Putin. "We could solve it," he said. "When you're
a prophet of doom, what keeps you going is not just prophesizing doom
but saying there are things we do to avoid that doom. That's where the
optimism is."

#### The drug trade is driven by profit---the plan doesn't resolve the insidious networks of U.S. financial institutions that sustain cartel violence

The other critical role the United States plays in ensuring that [the
drug war]{.underline} grinds on and [is profitable to American
corporations]{.underline} is the laundering of drug money. [The drug
trade is a strictly cash business,]{.underline} no credit cards or
checks accepted. [Billions in cash need to be turned into other
currencies or usable assets on both sides of the border]{.underline}.
Colombian drug kingpins created the Black Market Peso Exchange, and
"peso brokers" illegally convert dollars into pesos. [American financial
institutions---Bank of America, Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, HSBC, and
Wachovia--- have been investigated for laundering drug
money.]{.underline} 80 HSBC got caught. From 2006 to 2010, the Sinaloa
cartel, the Colombian Norte del Valle cartel, and other drug traffickers
laundered at least \$881 million in illegal narcotics trafficking
proceeds through HSBC. Matt Taibbi described how the cash was washed:
"[The banks' laundering transactions were so brazen that the NSA
probably could have spotted them from space.]{.underline}" Breuer \[US
Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer\] admitted drug dealers would
sometimes come to HSBC's Mexican branches and "deposit hundreds of
thousands of dollars in cash, in a single day, into a single account,
using boxes designed to fit the precise dimensions of the teller
windows."81 Executives at HSBC admitted guilt and were fined \$1.9
billion. That's about two months worth of profits for the bank.
Incredibly, no one went to prison. The capitalist financial system plays
a decisive role in the maintenance of the global illicit drug trade.
T[he banks are happy to manage and invest \$350 to \$500 billion a year
in illegal drug profits for criminal organizations. The laundering nets
banking networks and intermediaries---lawyers, brokers and trust
managers---about \$150 billion annually.]{.underline} 82 The National
Drug Intelligence Center estimates that Mexican and Colombian drug
traffickers launder between \$18 billion and \$39 billion every year.83
[Drug profits function as liquid investment capital and are so critical
and integrated into the world banking system that during the 2008
economic meltdown]{.underline}, according to Rajeev Syal, "[Drugs money
worth billions kept the financial system afloat at the height of the
global crisis." 84]{.underline}

#### We control the root cause debate -- neoliberalism fuels violence in Mexico

**Redmond 15**(Helen Redmond writes about the international war on drugs
and health care policy for numerous publications. She is a Licensed

economy of Mexico\'s drug war", 2015, The International Socialist

Under the administration of Carlos Salinas, [neoliberal economic reforms
transformed Mexico into a giant "free market.]{.underline}" State
control of key sectors of the economy were auctioned off to private
investors in a free-for-all. Carlos Slim was a major beneficiary of this
process. Slim, the richest man in the world, is estimated to be worth
\$69 billion. He bought the state-owned telephone company Telmex, which
came to dominate the cell phone market in Mexico. The passage of the
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994 fast-tracked the
break up of the state owned economy and had the effect of making Mexico
heavily dependent on and more integrated into the US economy. By 2006,
around 85 percent of Mexico's exports were sold in the United States.
For Mexican workers and farmers, NAFTA was like a housing collapse. In
the first year of the agreement, there were one million layoffs. At the
end of 1996, there were 8 million unemployed and five million working in
the informal economy.53 Workers in foreign-owned export assembly plants
called maquiladoras earned six dollars a day. That wage left millions of
Mexican families living in abject poverty. Farmers felt the impact of
NAFTA through the amendment of Article 27 of the Constitution. As a
condition of membership in NAFTA, Mexico was forced to eliminate the
system of communal land sharing known as ejido. Public lands were
divided up and converted into private property. [Subsidies to farmers
were eliminated, and government price regulation of staple crops
scrapped. Government-subsidized stores that made food available to the
poor were closed.]{.underline} The price of basic foodstuffs doubled and
tripled at the same time that wages fell. Mexico went from being almost
self-sufficient in food production to importing over 40 percent of its
food, mostly from the United States. Hundreds of thousands of
small-scale farmers lost their farms to the corporate giants of
agriculture. [NAFTA created a new billionaire]{.underline} business
elite in Mexico---men like Carlos Slim---but also [businessmen like
Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzmán Loera, the CEO of the Sinaloa drug
cartel.]{.underline} He made the Forbes billionaire list four times and
is worth between one and ten billion dollars. Cell phones and cocaine
both have huge consumer markets. As does methamphetamines (meth), a
stimulant that increases energy and alertness. El Chapo, a capitalist
innovator of new drugs, saw the potential for huge profits in the
methamphetamine market and set up super-laboratories close to the US
border earning him the nickname "El Rey de Cristal," the crystal king,
and Mexico the nickname "Methico."54 Meth found a ready sales force of
unemployed workers in the Midwest who sold to workers in food processing
plants, who often worked double shifts.55 The media launched a meth
scare and the DEA shifted resources to combat the Mexican drug
trafficking organizations that smuggled it into the US by the ton. [The
free market reforms that the NAFTA implemented in the legal Mexican
economy reshaped and expanded the illegal narcoeconomy. Drug cartels
bought bankrupted farms on the cheap and increased the cultivation of
poppy and marijuana on lands that used to grow corn, beans, and other
staple crops. To facilitate the increased cross-border trade,
investments were made in transportation infrastructure. But the
highways, bridges, and rail lines that were built to carry cheap imports
from the maquiladoras into the United States were also used to import
drugs.]{.underline} The number of vehicles crossing the border swelled
and the pressure on customs agents to limit inspections and waive
freight trucks, trains, vans, and cars through security checkpoints
greatly benefitted drug-smuggling operations. The unemployed found
dangerous but well paying, steady jobs in the recession-proof drug trade
as farmers, drug couriers, truck drivers, chemists, street sellers,
informants, armed security guards, and sicarios(hired killers). [The
drug trade is unique in needing a class of workers with job skills that
include the ability to torture, dismember, kidnap, rape, and murder. The
drug cartels recruit cadets from Mexican police academies funded by
US-taxpayer money.]{.underline} A former sicario explained: "[All of the
law enforcement academies in Mexico---the different police forces, the
investigative police, the military police, and the army---have been used
by the narco-trafficking organizations as training grounds for their
future employees]{.underline}."56 One of the most feared and brutal drug
cartels, Los Zetas, were trained by a Special Forces group at Ft. Bragg,
North Carolina.57In Nuevo Laredo, Reynosa, and Monterrey, banners
brazenly advertise employment with the Zetas. One banner declared, "Los
Zetas wants you. Military, or ex-military. We offer [a good salary,
food, and we care for your family. Do not suffer bad treatment. Do not
suffer hunger."]{.underline}58 In some states, the drug cartels use
their profits to build schools and medical clinics, and to open new
businesses. They're viewed as Robin Hoods that help the poor who've been
abandoned by the corrupt, rich elite in Mexico City. It is the
illegality of the drug trade that forces disputes within the industry to
be settled outside of the law, hence the need for sicarios. Legal
businesses can sue competitors or win monetary settlements and prison
terms through the justice system. The sicarios enforce a rough justice
on rival cartel members and even on their own who steal money, lose
drugs, or draw unwanted attention. Death is an essential part of the
illicit drug trade; it is a calculated business expense. The election of
Vicente Fox in 2000, which broke the PRI's seventy-one-year hold on
power, led to infighting between the PRI and the National Action Party
(PAN) and to a reorganization of federal and state police and political
institutions. This change effectively ended the PRI's domination and
control of the drug trade by dismantling the plaza system. With the PRI
no longer able to impose a structure and order on the drug trade and the
splintering of government authority, the cartels saw an opening to act
more independently. They began to focus on buying off or intimidating
local authorities in order to ensure safe transit of their goods.59 The
unraveling of the plazasystem led to more turf wars among cartels. And
the violence associated with the drug trade accelerated to more extreme
heights because there was no longer any way to settle disputes over who
controlled the plazas. [The growth of the drug trade and the dramatic
uptick in murders in Mexico has to be seen as a consequence of the
changing economic environment enacted by neoliberal
policies.]{.underline} NAFTA helped to consolidate the central role of
the drug trade in the Mexican economy and provided the cartels with a
poor, desperate, disposable and criminalized workforce with no human or
civil rights. And with the PRI no longer able to impose political
stability or to control social groups, a power vacuum was created that
the drug kingpins filled.

#### The alternative is a historical materialist critique of the system---pedagogical spaces are the crucial staging ground for keeping socialism on the horizon

**McLaren and Scatamburlo-D'Annibale 4** (Peter **McLaren**,
Distinguished Fellow -- Critical Studies @ Chapman U and UCLA urban
schooling prof, and Valerie **Scatamburlo-D'Annibale**, associate
professor of Communication -- U Windsor, "Class Dismissed? Historical
materialism and the politics of 'difference'," Educational Philosophy
and Theory Vol. 36, Issue 2, p. 183-199)

For well over two decades we have witnessed the jubilant liberal and
conservative pronouncements of the demise of socialism. Concomitantly,
[history\'s presumed failure to defang]{.underline} existing [capitalist
relations has been read]{.underline} by many self-identified 'radicals'
[as an advertisement for capitalism\'s inevitability.]{.underline} As a
result, [the chorus refrain 'There Is No Alternative']{.underline}, sung
by liberals and conservatives, [has been buttressed by the symphony of
**post-Marxist voices** recommending that we give socialism
a]{.underline} decent [burial and move on]{.underline}. Within this
context, to speak of the promise of Marx and socialism may appear
anachronistic, even naïve, especially since the post-al intellectual
vanguard has presumably demonstrated the folly of doing so. Yet we
stubbornly believe that the chants of T.I.N.A. must be combated for they
offer as a fait accompli, something which progressive [Leftists should
**refuse to accept**]{.underline}---namely **[the triumph of
capitalism]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} its political bedfellow
[neo-liberalism, which have worked together to naturalize suffering,
undermine collective struggle, and obliterate hope]{.underline}. We
concur with Amin (1998), who claims that [such chants must be defied and
revealed as absurd]{.underline} and criminal, and who puts the challenge
we face in no uncertain terms: [humanity may let itself be led by
capitalism\'s logic to a **fate of collective suicide**]{.underline} [or
it may pave the way for an alternative humanist project of global
socialism.]{.underline} The [grosteque conditions]{.underline} that
inspired Marx to pen his original critique [of capitalism
are]{.underline} present and [flourishing.]{.underline} The
[inequalities]{.underline} of wealth and the gross imbalances of power
that exist today [are leading to abuses that exceed those encountered in
Marx\'s day]{.underline} (Greider, 1998, p. 39). Global capitalism has
paved the way for [the obscene concentration of wealth]{.underline} in
fewer and fewer hands and [created a world]{.underline} increasingly
[divided between]{.underline} those who enjoy [opulent affluence
and]{.underline} those who languish in [dehumanizing
conditions]{.underline} and economic misery. In every corner of the
globe, [we are witnessing social disintegration]{.underline} as revealed
by a rise in [abject poverty and inequality.]{.underline} At the current
historical juncture, the combined assets of the 225 richest people is
roughly equal to the annual income of the poorest 47 percent of the
world\'s population, while the combined assets of the three richest
people exceed the combined GDP of the 48 poorest nations (CCPA, 2002, p.
3). Approximately [2.8 billion people]{.underline}---almost half of the
world\'s population---[struggle in desperation to live on less than two
dollars a day]{.underline} (McQuaig, 2001, p. 27). As many as [250
million children are wage slaves]{.underline} and there are [over a
billion workers]{.underline} who [are either un- or under-employed.
These]{.underline} are the [concrete realities]{.underline} of our
time---realities that **[require a vigorous class
analysis]{.underline}**, [an **unrelenting critique** of capitalism and
an oppositional politics capable of confronting]{.underline} what Ahmad
(1998, p. 2) refers to as ['capitalist universality.']{.underline} They
are realities that require something more than that which is offered by
the prophets of 'difference' and post-Marxists who would have us
relegate socialism to the scrapheap of history and mummify Marxism along
with Lenin\'s corpse. [Never before has a Marxian analysis of
capitalism]{.underline} and class rule [been so desperately
needed.]{.underline} That is not to say that everything Marx said or
anticipated has come true, for that is clearly not the case. [Many
critiques of Marx focus on his strategy for moving toward socialism, and
with ample justification; nonetheless Marx did provide us with
**fundamental insights**]{.underline} [into class society **that have
held true**]{.underline} to this day. Marx\'s enduring relevance lies in
his indictment of capitalism which continues to wreak havoc in the lives
of most. While capitalism\'s cheerleaders have attempted to hide its
sordid underbelly, Marx\'s description of capitalism as the sorcerer\'s
dark power is even more apt in light of contemporary historical and
economic conditions. [Rather than jettisoning Marx, decentering the role
of capitalism, and discrediting class analysis, radical educators must
continue to engage Marx\'s oeuvre and extrapolate]{.underline} from it
[that which is useful **pedagogically, theoretically,
and**]{.underline}, most importantly, **[politically]{.underline}** in
light of the challenges that confront us. [The urgency]{.underline}
which animates Amin\'s call [for a collective socialist vision
**necessitates**]{.underline}, as we have argued, [moving beyond the
particularism]{.underline} and liberal pluralism [that informs the
'politics of difference.' It]{.underline} also [**requires** challenging
the **questionable assumptions** that have come to constitute the core
of contemporary 'radical']{.underline} theory,
**[pedagogy]{.underline}** and politics. [In terms of effecting change,
what is needed is a cogent **understanding** of the systemic nature of
exploitation and oppression based on the]{.underline} precepts of a
[radical political economy approach]{.underline} (outlined above) and
one that incorporates Marx\'s notion of 'unity in difference' in which
people share widely common material interests. [Such an understanding
extends far beyond the realm of theory]{.underline}, for the manner in
which we choose to interpret and explore the social world, [the
**concepts and frameworks** we use to express our sociopolitical
understandings, are more than just abstract categories. They imply
intentions, organizational practices, and political agendas. Identifying
class analysis as the basis for our]{.underline} understandings and
class [struggle]{.underline} as the basis for political transformation
[implies something **quite different** than constructing]{.underline} a
sense of [political agency around issues of race, ethnicity, gender,
etc.]{.underline} Contrary to 'Shakespeare\'s assertion that a rose by
any other name would smell as sweet,' it should be clear that this is
not the case in political matters. Rather, [in politics 'the
essence]{.underline} of the flower **[lies in the name by which it is
called']{.underline}** (Bannerji, 2000, p. 41). [The task for
progressives]{.underline} today [is to seize the moment and plant the
seeds for a political agenda that is grounded in historical
possibilities]{.underline} and informed by a vision committed to
overcoming exploitative conditions. [These seeds]{.underline}, we would
argue, [must be derived from]{.underline} the tree of [radical political
economy. For]{.underline} the vast majority of people today---[people of
**all** 'racial classifications or **identities**, all genders and
sexual orientations'---the common frame of reference]{.underline} arcing
across 'difference', the 'concerns and aspirations that are most widely
shared [are]{.underline} those that are [rooted in]{.underline} [the
common experience of everyday life]{.underline} shaped and [constrained
by **political economy'**]{.underline} (Reed, 2000, p. xxvii). [While
post-Marxist advocates of the politics of 'difference'
suggest]{.underline} that [such a stance is outdated, we]{.underline}
would [argue that the categories which they have employed]{.underline}
to analyze 'the social' [are]{.underline} now [losing their
usefulness,]{.underline} particularly in light of actual contemporary
'social movements.' [**All over the globe**, there are large
anti-capitalist movements]{.underline} afoot. In February 2002, chants
of 'Another World Is Possible' became the theme of protests in Porto
Allegre. It seems that those [people struggling in the streets haven't
read about]{.underline} T.I.N.A., [the end of grand narratives of
emancipation, or the decentering of capitalism.]{.underline} It seems as
though the struggle for basic survival and some semblance of human
dignity in the mean streets of the dystopian metropoles doesn't permit
much time or opportunity to read the heady proclamations emanating from
seminar rooms. As E. P. Thompson (1978, p. 11) once remarked, sometimes
'experience walks in without knocking at the door, and announces deaths,
crises of subsistence, trench warfare, unemployment, inflation,
genocide.' [This]{.underline}, of course, [does not mean]{.underline}
that [socialism will inevitably come about, yet a sense of
its]{.underline} nascent [promise animates current social
movements.]{.underline} Indeed, noted historian Howard Zinn (2000, p.
20) recently pointed out that [after years of single-issue
organizing]{.underline} (i.e. the politics of difference), [the WTO and
other anti-corporate capitalist protests signaled a turning point in the
'history of movements]{.underline} of recent decades,' for [it was the
issue of 'class' that]{.underline} more than anything '[bound everyone
together]{.underline}.' History, to paraphrase Thompson (1978, p. 25)
doesn't seem to be following Theory\'s script. Our vision is informed by
Marx\'s historical materialism and his revolutionary socialist humanism,
which must not be conflated with liberal humanism. For left politics and
pedagogy, [a socialist humanist vision **remains crucial**,
whose]{.underline} fundamental [features include the creative potential
of people to challenge collectively the circumstances that they
inherit.]{.underline} This variant of humanism seeks to give expression
to the pain, sorrow and degradation of the oppressed, those who labor
under the ominous and ghastly cloak of 'globalized' capital. It calls
for the transformation of those conditions that have prevented the bulk
of humankind from fulfilling its potential. [It vests]{.underline} its
[hope for change in the development of critical consciousness and social
agents who make history]{.underline}, although not always in conditions
of their choosing. The political goal of socialist humanism is, however,
'not a resting in difference' but rather 'the emancipation of difference
at the level of human mutuality and reciprocity.' This would be a step
forward for the 'discovery or creation of our real differences which can
only in the end be explored in reciprocal ways' (Eagleton, 1996, p.
120). Above all else, [the enduring relevance of a radical socialist
pedagogy and politics is the **centrality**]{.underline} [it accords to
the interrogation of capitalism.]{.underline} We can no longer afford to
remain indifferent to the horror and savagery committed by capitalist\'s
barbaric machinations. [We need to recognize that capitalist democracy
is unrescuably contradictory in its own self-constitution.]{.underline}
Capitalism and democracy cannot be translated into one another without
profound efforts at manufacturing empty idealism. [Committed Leftists
must **unrelentingly cultivate** **a democratic socialist
vision**]{.underline} that refuses to forget the 'wretched of the
earth,' the children of the damned and the victims of the culture of
silence---a task which requires more than abstruse convolutions and
striking ironic poses in the agnostic arena of signifying practices.
[Leftists must]{.underline} illuminate the little shops of horror that
lurk beneath 'globalization's' shiny façade; they must [challenge the
true 'evils]{.underline}' that are [manifest in]{.underline} the
tentacles of [global capitalism\'s reach.]{.underline} And, more than
this, [Leftists must search for the cracks in the edifice of globalized
capitalism and **shine light on those fissures that give birth to
alternatives.**]{.underline} [Socialism]{.underline} today, undoubtedly,
[runs against the grain of received wisdom, but its vision of a vastly
improved and freer arrangement of social relations beckons on the
horizon. Its unwritten text is nascent in the present]{.underline} even
as it exists among the fragments of history and the shards of distant
memories. Its potential remains untapped and its promise needs to be
redeemed.

\*Yes the card is super over highlighted, but it's actually SO good, I
could read every single word of this

Revolutionary Critical Pedagogy **[A revolutionary critical educational
project recognizes that neither guns, poverty, racism, nor other
socially devastating antagonisms can be obliterated within the current
capitalist system]{.underline}**. [The possibility for overthrowing a
system that thrives on the destruction of humanity---on war, murder,
famine, racism, and hatred---lies in the ability of people to join
together against the transnational capitalist class]{.underline}. Marx
prophesized that our historical reality would lead us toward a socialist
alternative and that the history of humankind was the history of class
struggle, a struggle to reach our full potential as human beings through
the creation of a society no longer dependent on value production.
[Revolutionary critical pedagogy is an educational agenda for creating a
mobilized mass of critically educated people in schools and university
classrooms, in labor union meetings, among church groups and factory
workers, and in any formulation where people can come together to
explore their particular social conditions and human potential, where
clarity can be developed and action that leads to greater clarity can be
taken for the sake of critically confronting our existing capitalist
reality]{.underline} (Freire, 1970). With an increased understanding of
our combined knowledges and resources and our stolen humanity, we can
learn to imagine our true potential, to labor creatively beyond
necessity, and to seek changes, small and large, toward this
transformation. **[To expel the culture of gun violence]{.underline}**
to the outer darkness [means defying outright customary duties and
affiliations associated with this domain,]{.underline} and [this means
more than desacralizing the role that violence plays in our everyday
lives or radically condemning the violence at the heart of the founding
of modernity, or proscribing the sale of guns or forcing official
culture into a rigid corset of prohibitions against
violence]{.underline}. **[To require the public to abandon guns is not
perforce the augury of a peaceful world, because the founding slaughter
over our modern civilization needs to be understood critically in order
that the violent culture of guns does not repeat itself]{.underline}**.
To mortally deform, definitively compromise, or leech from within the
divine violence associated with the founding genocide of the United
States requires an understanding of the role that violence has played in
the construction of American identity. **[We denounce guns and all
destruction of humanity. Yet, we are not naïve enough to imagine that
the capitalist class will put down their ideological weapons of death
and allow the workers of the world to free themselves and their
oppressors without a fight]{.underline}**. [It is not our task to
determine the course of this transformation]{.underline}. [We understand
the ideological contradiction that we espouse]{.underline}. [As critical
educators, we work to reach those who will engage with us and to
encourage those who are initially reluctant to engage in anticapitalist
struggle and in the forging of a socialist democracy that will free us
to be fully human and teach us to love truly and radically]{.underline}.

people**]{.underline}. [Racism, an appeal to patriarchy, and other
related antagonisms are used strategically to negate the humanity of the
Other and enable soldiers to see them as expendable in the context of
war]{.underline}. When the word terrorism reverberates through the mass
media, White Americans cringe at the perceived threat to their way of
life. Shout the word "terrorism," and the dominant group acquiesce to
the Patriot Act, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA),
violations of the Amendments to the Constitution, and the Bill of
Rights, not to mention the suspension of Posse Comitatus during the
Boston bombings or any time local police forces claim exigent
circumstances to apprehend a known suspect or fugitive. [Under the cloak

are too evident to be ignored and uprisings are increasingly
common]{.underline}. [The racist attack on Mexican immigrants and
Chicanx communities]{.underline} within the United States **[extends

government and]{.underline} U.S. transnational [corporations as
benevolently providing jobs to those poor souls from the developing
world who cannot sustain themselves within a global
economy]{.underline}. [The border patrol and the narco-terrorist
industry provide an increasingly militarized gateway that secures a mass

the United States]{.underline}**. This "service" of extracting the
greatest surplus value from the Mexican worker and controlling the
political arena of the entire hemisphere to secure open markets for
exploitation of people and natural resources by U.S. corporations stems
not from an incessant and inhuman greed but instead is a result of the
monstrous logic of capitalism. **[Under such logic, capitalism must

first major Congressional action on gun control in nearly two decades
occurred in the wake of 2012's spate of mass shootings, a small group of
senators supported by the NRA blocked the legislation from passage and
ensured a plump U.S. civilian market for the Mexican drug cartels and
condemned thousands more Mexicans to an early death (Parakilas, 2013).

Sexual Division, a Problem in Ontology So far we have still been mostly
discussing the question of sexuality in its peculiar ontological status.
But how exactly does sexual difference enter this debate? What is the
relationship between sexual difference and sexuality tout court? Is it
accidental or essential? Which comes first? Is sexuality some- thing
that takes place because there is sexual difference? Freud's answer is
unambiguous, and perhaps surprising: "The sexual drive is in the first
instance independent of its object; nor is its origin likely to be due
to its object's attractions" (Freud 1977a, 83). This is why, "[from the
point of view of psychoanalysis, the exclusive sexual interest felt by
men for women is also a problem that needs elucidating and is not a
self-evident fact based upon an attraction that is ultimately of a
chemical nature]{.underline}" (ibid., 57). Moreover, [he famously
insists on the original nonexistence of any germ of two sexes (or two
sexualities) during preadolescence]{.underline}. Let us start directly
with this contro- versial passage:

> [The auto-erotic activity of the erotogenic zones is]{.underline},
> however, [the same in both sexes, and owing to this uniformity there
> is no possibility of a distinction between the two sexes such as
> arises after puberty]{.underline}\....Indeed, [if we were able to give
> a more definite connotation to the concepts of "masculine" and
> "feminine]{.underline}," [it would]{.underline} even [be possible to
> maintain that libido is invariably and necessary of a masculine
> nature]{.underline}, whether it occurs in men or in women and
> irrespectively of whether its object is a man or a woman. (Freud
> 1977a, 141)

In other words, **[at the level of the libido there are not two
sexes]{.underline}**. [And if we were able to say what exactly is
"masculine" and "feminine," we would describe it as "masculine"---but we
are precisely not able to say this]{.underline}, as Freud further
emphasizes in the footnote attached to the quoted passage.4 So what
exactly are we dealing with here, [what is Freud saying in that pas-
sage? His formulations are especially interesting in relation to the
sponta- neous "liberal" understanding of sexual difference, pointing to
a necessary ambivalence of sexual positions]{.underline}. [According to
this understanding]{.underline}, [**Masculin- ity and Femininity are
just ideals** (ideal genders) **that exist nowhere in real- ity** (no
person is one hundred percent masculine or feminine); **men and women
exist only as differently portioned mixtures of these two ideal
states**]{.underline} ([or"principles"---biological or
otherwise]{.underline}).To put this in Nietzschean-sound- ing parlance:
There are no Men and Women, only different degrees, different shades of
masculinity and femininity\.... What Freud is saying in the passage
above, however, is something quite different from this "nobody is
perfect" kind of wisdom; something much more interesting and
counterintuitive. The point is not that if there were something like
pure Masculinity and pure Femininity, we would be dealing with an ideal,
clear case or model of sexual difference. Freud's point includes a much
more paradoxical claim: if pure Masculinity and pure Femininity existed
(if we were able to say what they are), they---or, rather, their
sexuality---would be one and the same ("masculine"). But since they do
not exist, there is sexual difference. In other words, sexual difference
arises not from there being two sexes or two sexualities (at least in
principle), but from the fact that there is no "second sex," and from an
enigmatic indifference of the "sexual thing" (polymorphically perverse
autoeroticism) that appears at the point of the "missing sex." Moreover,
[if the "second sex" is missing, this does not imply that we have only a
"first sex" (masculinity), since one sex does not amount to "sex" at
all: if there is only one sex, it is not a "sex" in any meaningful
way]{.underline}. \... To express it in a single formula: [What splits
into two is the very nonexistence of the one]{.underline} (that is, of
the one which, if it existed, would be the Other). Freud's paradoxical
claims concerning sexuality and sexual difference receive a very
elaborate conceptual treatment from Lacan, putting the question of
sexuality and its split at the very core of psychoanalytic "ontology"---
insofar as the latter includes the point of its own impossibility.
Sexuality and sexual difference are absolutely, and irreducibly, linked
to the signifying order, yet this does not mean that sexual difference
is a symbolic construction. Sex is real because it marks an irreducible
limit (contradiction) of the signifying order (and not something beyond
or outside this order). There is, how- ever, an important difference in
conceiving this between Lacan's early and late work. Lacan's early work
is conceptually fortifying what he takes to be Freud's position, with
the help of his theory of the signifying order and of his (or perhaps,
rather, Kojève's) reading of Hegelian dialectics. His essay "The
Signification of the Phallus" (1958) provides what is arguably the most
concise formulation of this early position. The presence of the
signifier induces an irredeemable loss on the part of the human animal:
once it is articulated in the signifier (as "demand"), need is
irreversibly alienated.

> Let us thus examine the effects of this presence \[of the signifier\].
> They include, first, a deviation of man's needs due to the fact that
> he speaks: to the extent that his needs are subjected to demand, they
> come back to him in an alienated form\....What is thus alienated in
> needs constitutes an Urverdrängung \[primal repression\], as it
> cannot, hypothetically, be articulated in demand; it nevertheless
> appears in an offshoot that presents itself in man as desire (das
> Begheren).The phenomenology that emerges from analytic experience is
> certainly of a kind to demonstrate the paradoxical, deviant, erratic,
> eccentric, and even scandalous nature of desire that distinguishes it
> from need. (Lacan 2006c, 579)

This is indeed the basic outline of Lacan's early position: the presence
of the signifier induces a "pure loss" on the---if I may put it this
way---nonsignifying side of the human complex. This almost "physical"
loss opens up the space of significations ("meaning effects") and of the
dialectics of desire. And the phallus is famously defined by Lacan at
this time as designating these "meaning effects as a whole" (ibid.).
Later on (notably at the beginning of the 1970s) [Lacan all but reverses
this perspective, by]{.underline} introducing (or rather by
[formalizing]{.underline}, since he had already introduced it earlier)
[a further complication of the signifying order itself]{.underline}:
**[its being strictly coextensive with a signifying minus or
lack]{.underline}**. [The "pure loss" now appears on the side of the
signifier, which no longer has, or relates to, another side]{.underline}
(pure organic need on which it would perform its inaugural operation);
[what it has is a reverse side]{.underline} (l'envers). [Lacan has no
hesitation in referring to this minus as the foundation]{.underline} (of
the One of the signifying order). In other words, [it is no longer
simply the presence of the signifier that induces the entire human
"dialectics" and its contradictions, but rather an absence at the very
heart of this presence, namely, a gap that appears together with the
signifying order, as built into it]{.underline}. This rather shatters
the self- evidence of the term "emergence of the signifier" to which we
became accustomed in the Lacanian perspective: we have got used to
speaking about nature being somehow interrupted, thrown out of joint, by
the "emergence of the signifier." But what exactly does this mean? Does
it mean the same thing as "the appearing of speech"? Especially in the
context of Lacan's late work, it seems that we could also put things in
a different "mythological" perspective---mythological to the extent that
no narrative about the Begin- ning can avoid constructing a myth that
best suits the real of actual observation. In this alternative
perspective, [the human (hi)story begins not with the emergence of the
signifier, but with one signifier "gone missing."]{.underline} [We could
indeed say that nature is already full of signifiers (and at the same
time indiffer- ent to them); **and that at some point one signifier
"falls out," goes missing**]{.underline}. And it is only from this that
the "logic of the signifier" in the strict sense of the term is born
(signifiers start to "run," and to relate to each other, across this
gap). In this sense, and from this perspective, [speech itself is
already a response to the missing signifier, which is not
(there)]{.underline}. Speech **[is not simply "composed of signifiers,"
signifiers are not the (sufficient) condition of speech, the condition
of speech as we know it is "one-signifier-less."]{.underline}** Humans
are beings roused from indifference and forced to speak (as well as to
enjoy, since enjoyment appears at the place of this deficit) by one
signifier gone missing. [This temporal way of putting it ("gone
missing") is an expression of what would be better formulated as the
signifying structure emerging not simply without one signifier, but
rather with-without one signifier---since this "hole" has consequences,
and determines what gets structured around it.]{.underline} Some time
ago,5 I tried to formulate this specific structure with the help of a
joke which has often been used (by me and by others) since. I will
nevertheless repeat it here, since it is difficult to find a better
example to illustrate what is at stake: A guy goes into a restaurant and
says to the waiter: "Coffee without cream, please." The waiter replies:
"I'm sorry, sir, but we're out of cream. Could it be without milk?" The
waiter's response introduces an additional, paradoxical spectral entity
in the very dimension of negativity. The presupposition of his response
is that "without" something actually means "with the lack of something,"
or with- without something. The signifying order appears with one
signifier less in precisely this sense: not simply without one, but
with-without one. Two remarks could be added. First, it could well be
that this late work by Lacan (who no longer refers to Hegel) is actually
in many respects much closer to Hegel than his early work, where he
refers to Hegel frequently.6 And I would also say that this latter
perspective, which seems much further from Freud and his elaborations of
these issues, is in fact closer to Freud. In the "Three Essays on the
Theory of Sexuality," Freud situates the operative cause of deviations
from needs and instincts---the deviation constitutive of humankind---in
the surplus excitation/satisfaction produced in the process of the
satisfaction of somatic functions. "Oral pleasure," for example, which
arises as a by-product of the satisfying of the need for food, starts to
func- tion as an autonomous object of the drive; it moves away from its
first object and allows itself to be led into a series of substitute
objects. All satisfaction of a need allows, in principle, for another
satisfaction to occur, which tends to become independent and
self-perpetuating in pursuing and reproducing itself. There is no
natural need that could be absolutely pure, that is, devoid of this
surplus element which splits it from within. That is to say: for Freud,
the "human deviation" starts with a surplus (-enjoyment). In his early
work, Lacan, skeptical of what seems to be Freud's attempt at explaining
this deviation by a kind of linear causality starting from organic
needs, replaces, as we have seen, the Freudian surplus with loss:
[deviation starts with "pure loss" induced by the signifier on the part
of the body (as locus of the satisfaction of needs]{.underline}).
[Something of the need is irredeemably lost]{.underline} (cannot be
articulated in a demand), [and Lacan further links this to the
concept/moment of primal repression]{.underline}. This originally lost
bit of satisfaction then reappears within the signifying system (and
among beings that populate it) as its transcendental condition: the
absolute cause of desire. In his late work, Lacan, who situates the
minus (or loss) on the side of the signifying order itself (which
emerges with-without one signifier), actually comes closer to Freud,
provided that we take into account the additional point on which I
insisted earlier: that **[surplus-enjoyment itself is precisely what
emerges at the place of the signifying deficit or hole]{.underline}**.
This topological addition (in respect to Freud) is what makes the
Freudian observations quite compatible with Lacan's late work. That is
to say: Lacan's step does not consist simply in complementing Freud's
theory with the theory of the "emergence of the signifier"; rather, it
consists in complementing it with the theory (or speculative hypothesis)
of the lack of one signifier as the other side (l'envers) of the
surplus-enjoyment which pertains to the satisfaction of all our needs.
[In order to understand this surplus- enjoyment]{.underline} (and its
logic), [we need to understand that it appears at the place of a
signifying "hole" or minus]{.underline}. A further thing to point out is
that this also affects the notion of primal repression (in Lacan):
primal repression is now conceived as belonging to the signifying
structure itself; it appears as "one with" the originally missing
signifier, or as synonymous with the structure with-without. And---here
we come to the point which is most important for our
discussion---[sexual difference]{.underline}, or division, **[also
originates in this ontological deficit]{.underline}**. How to understand
this? There are two predominant psychoanalytic conceptions of sexual
difference. One reintroduces the duality of the sexes in the foundation
itself (this would be the Jungian perspective of two complementary
principles, yin--yang); the other starts with pure multiplicity as
emphasized by Freud. According to this reading, what Freud analyzed as
polymorphously perverse infantile sexuality shared by both boys and
girls is a heterogeneous multiplicity which subsequently gets organized
around two different positions by means of both hormonal and cultural
"injections" and demands. [Culture, which provides the normative
framework and identification parameters of "masculinity" and
"femininity," is said to be particularly determinant]{.underline} in
this. **[One is usually careful to add that the original multiplicity
and its contradictions are never fully resolved by our assuming of
sexual positions]{.underline}**, **[and the plurality of the sources of
satisfaction are never fully absorbed in the genital sexual
organization]{.underline}**\.... However, [what results from Lacan's
conceptualizations in his late work in relation to the question of
sexual division is actually something else]{.underline}, which in a way
reaffirms and conceptually fortifies the paradoxical formula implicit in
Freud's remarks on the subject. As I put it earlier: [What splits into
two is the very nonexistence of the one (that is, of the one which, if
it existed, would be the Other, the radically Other). **What splits in
two is the very "one that lacks," the minus, the
with-without**]{.underline}. This is how we could read Lacan's "formulas
of sexuation": as two ways in which the constitutive minus of the
signifying order is inscribed in this order itself, and dealty with. The
operator which marks the constitutive minus of the symbolic order is
written by Lacan as Φx (the "phallic function" or the "function of
castration"---these are synonymous). In this sense we could say that
[castration is a subjectivizing reiteration of the inaugurating
minus]{.underline}. And [the next step brings us to the core of Lacan's
revolutionary thinking of sexual difference]{.underline}:
[castration]{.underline} (or the "phallic function") [**is a universal
function,** a prerogative of subjectivity as such]{.underline}
(**[regardless of sex]{.underline}**), [yet there is nothing sexually
neutral about its operation; it always involves following the logic of
this or that (sexed) position, and does not exist as a neutral
foundation, or as a zero level of subjectivity]{.underline}. A "zero
level" of subjectivity already involves a "decision," that is, this or
that form of the "minus one." In other words, although the operator of
castration is the prerogative of subjectivity, there is no subjectivity
that would not handle it in this or that way, nor does "castration"
exist outside the way in which it is handled. That is to say: **[there
is no subjectivity beyond or beneath (or simply outside) the sexual
division]{.underline}**. [Sexual difference is not a secondary
distinction of subjectivity]{.underline}, [or simply culturally
constructed, since the means of the signifying construction of sexuality
are already biased by the logical "parallax" by which the ontological
deficit of the signifying order is inscribed in (or at work in) this
same order]{.underline}. As Guy Le Gaufey insists with great
persistence, Lacan's formulas of sexuation are not his attempt to "find
a pertinent feature differentiating man and women" (Le Gaufey 2006, 86).
Or, in another poignant formulation, "[perhaps, the difference which
keeps apart one \[sex\] from the other belongs neither to the one nor to
the other]{.underline}" (ibid., 11). This was Joan Copjec's profound
intuition when she discussed the formulas of sexuation in relation to
the Kantian antinomies of reason: difference or contradiction does not
so much exist between the two sides or positions. Rather, [the two
positions are parallel configurations of a difference or contradiction
of the signifying order itself, which they logically decline in
different ways (each one reproducing the fundamental contradiction in
its own way).]{.underline} **[What puts these two configurations in a
(non-)relation is that they share the same function]{.underline}** (Φx),
[yet at the same time this very fact prevents any kind of symmetry or
complementarity between them]{.underline}. From a differentiating
feature (based on the opposition presence/absence: some have it, some do
not),7 [Lacan makes the phallus the signifier of the difference as
such]{.underline}. [**What makes all the difference (for beings of
speech) is "castration."** The phallus does not constitute this
difference, but signifies it, for both sexes (and regardless of whether
one is homosexual or heterosexual)]{.underline}. **[Sexual difference is
a difference in configuring what makes all the difference: the minus
marked by the phallic function as the function of
castration]{.underline}**. (The following diagram is reproduced from
Lacan 2006c.)

There are many extremely elaborate Lacanian readings of these formulas,
providing and explaining their complex logical background, as well as
interpreting their conceptual consequences.8 It is not my purpose here
to engage in a discussion of this sort and scope. I will confine myself
to some remarks that could link these formulas to the specific
ontological inquiry into the sexual which I am pursuing in this book.
The masculine (left) side posits that there exists One that is not
castrated (and has access to full enjoyment: the primordial Father, the
Woman) 9 ∃x Φx. The exclusion of this One---that is, positing it as an
exception, or exempting it---is the way in which the subject emerging on
this side appropriates, frames, the minus involved in the signifying
order. The exception (of a non-castrated One) functions as constitutive,
that is, as the negative reference point, or the limit that permits
everything else to be constituted as such, that is, to appear as
everything else, or as a whole: all x are Φx, all x are subject to the
function of castration (∀x Φx).The exception is inscribed here in the
very appearing of all as all (as a determined totality): this is how one
has to read together the two formulas in the upper-left corner of the
scheme. The logic at stake here is nicely summed up by the following
joke: "There are no ca nibals here, we ate the last one yesterday": the
condition of "all of us" being "civilized" (non-cannibal) is the act of
exemption that makes us "all." This is also what is at stake in the
Freudian myth of the killing of the primordial Father (as possessor of
all women), followed by everyone giving up the claim to an "unlimited
enjoyment" represented by the figure of the primordial Father. The
exception (the "killing") of the One frames the renunciation common to
all. This basically means: everyone has to give up what they never had,
and what is represented by the mythical figure of the primordial Father.
The primordial Father is mythical in the precise sense that it is a
necessary presupposition (and retrospective image) of the very notion of
renunciation. [Everyone has to give up what they never had---yet the
form of giving it up is nonetheless essential. This is perhaps also the
best definition of castration: to give up what one never had, that is to
say, to transform the "minus one" which comes with the signifying order
into something that we have renounced; to transform what we never had
into something lost.]{.underline} **[In this kind of "framing" the
negativity, the "negative quantity," of the signifier order acquires a
signifying form, a privileged signifier; the lack of the signifier gets
a signifier, and this signifier is called Phallus]{.underline}**. [This
brings us to the lower part of the left side of the formulas relying on
its signifier]{.underline} (Φ or the master-signifier, S ---Lacan
explicitly makes 1 this connection) as the support of this subjective
position, that is, as the support of "masculine" subjectivation. [This
"assuming" it by means of the master-signifier]{.underline}---that is,
by means of giving a signifying frame to the lack in the Other---[equals
assuming it by repressing it]{.underline}. [**One puts one's faith in
the hands of the signifier, but one does not want to know anything about
what takes place in this swap (namely,"cas- tration").** The subject
thus relies on the signifying support of castration, Φ]{.underline} (we
can say: he doesn't need to know anything about castration because the
signifier "knows" it for him),10 [and establishes a relation to the
Other in the guise of the small a on the right-hand side of the
formulas]{.underline}. What does this mean, or imply? The mythical One
of exception (the One which, by being "cut out," so to speak, provides
the signifying frame of the inaugural minus) also constitutes the frame
or the "window of fantasy," as Lacan puts it, through which the other
can appear as desirable (as object-cause of desire). In other words: the
"formal" structure that provides the signifying frame for the lack of
the signifier, combined with the particular circumstances in which this
"swap" takes place for a subject, determines the concrete conditions
under which (and only under which) the Other appears desirable. Hence
Lacan's statement that man "never deals with anything by way of a
partner but object a inscribed on the other side of the bar. He is
unable to attain his sexual partner, who is the Other, except inasmuch
as his partner is the cause of his desire" (Lacan 1999, 80). We have a
nice illustration of this, to borrow one of Žižek's examples, in
Hitchcock's movie Rear Window. James Stewart, immobilized by having his
whole leg in plaster, is killing time by observing the people who live
in the building opposite. A young nurse visits him every morning, and
his fiancée (Grace Kelly) every evening. Grace Kelly is beautiful, rich,
and crazy about Stewart. Yet he hardly seems to notice her, and is
certainly in no hurry to marry her. Their relationship thus does not
work too well, and they are on the verge of breaking it off. But this
starts to change when they notice that strange things have been going on
in one of the apartments across from Stewart's---it looks as if the man
who lives there has just killed his wife. The young couple start playing
detective together, and a decisive change in their relationship takes
place when Kelly enters the apartment under investigation, appearing in
the window. The supposed murderer is out, and she is looking for clues
to the crime. Stewart is observing this from his own window: he watches
her searching the apartment, and being surprised by the unexpected
return of the man who lives there. This short sequence changes
everything: Stewart behaves as if he were seeing Grace Kelly for the
first time; she captures his full attention, and, completely fascinated,
he can no longer take his eyes off her. Without a word being exchanged
between them, we---as spectators---can see it all: now he very much
desires her. She has quite literally entered the "window of his
fantasy," and started to function as the object of his desire\.... [Let
us now look on the other, feminine (right) side of the formulas of
sexuation. Here the minus one that comes with the signifying order
(constituting its real) configures differently: castration, as the
signifying operator of the minus,]{.underline} non-castrated Other. [We
start with negation of a possible exception]{.underline}, ∃x Φx: [there
is no x which does not fall under the phallic function]{.underline}
(that is, under the function of castration). [**Castration allows for no
exception. And it is precisely this that makes any universal statement
impossible, as we read in the second line of the "feminine" formulas:
not all x are Φx. We cannot speak of** **"all" women or, simply, of the
woman**]{.underline}. [Why is the possibility of an exception excluded
on this, the feminine side]{.underline}? What does it mean or imply? [It
is the logical writing of the juncture of the following two claims.
First, woman is]{.underline} "[the Other]{.underline}, in the most
radical sense, in the sexual relationship" (Lacan 1999, 81). [And
second, "there is no Other of the Other]{.underline}." [**If woman is
the Other of man, man is not the Other of woman. There is no Other of
the Other---the Other is included in the Other (as the Other sex).**
This is what is expressed by the following paradoxical formulation:
"Being the Other\..., woman is that which has a relationship to that
Other"]{.underline} (ibid.). In other words, [the relationship to the
Other is, so to speak, included in the Other; it is "part" of the
Other]{.underline}. [Whereas a man can think of the Other as the
exception to the rule, to his rule, on the basis of which he relates to
women]{.underline}, **[a woman cannot think of the Other as the
exception to her rule, but as part of the rule]{.underline}**, as
included in the rule. This affects significantly the nature of this
rule, making it "not-all." [The nonexistence of the Other is itself
inscribed into the Other. And this is precisely what the concept of the
unconscious is about: the point where the nonexistence of the Other is
itself inscribed into the Other. And, as suggested by the concept of the
unconscious, this is not a point of self-reflective transparency, but
that of a signifying gap constitutive of knowledge.]{.underline} This
further implies that the infamous Lacanian "barred Other" is not simply
an inconsistent, lacking Other, but the Other the inconsistency of which
is inscribed in it, and has itself a marker in it: Lacan writes it as
S(Ⱥ), signifier of the Other as barred. But what is this signifier? Here
Lacan makes a most surprising connection: "by S(Ⱥ) I designate nothing
other than woman's jouissance" (Lacan 1999, 84).[The signifier at stake
is thus a most peculiar one]{.underline}. In order to understand what
precisely is at stake here, we can relate it directly to the following
crucial claim, made above: [the emergence of the signifying order
directly coincides with the non-emergence of one signifier, and at the
place of this gap appears enjoyment as the heterogeneous element
pertaining to the signifying structure, yet irreducible to
it]{.underline}. In this precise sense, [the enjoyment at stake
essentially belongs to the unconscious]{.underline} (and to its "gap"):
[not as repressed, but as the very substance of the missing signifier
which, as missing, gives its form to the unconscious]{.underline}. This
also explains Lacan's emphasis (in Seminar XX, where he discusses
formulas of sexuation) on the question of knowledge and its "limits":
Can one know---and say---anything about this other, non-phallic
enjoyment? The answer is no: **[one cannot say anything about this
enjoyment, this other enjoyment cannot be an object of knowledge,
because it is a placeholder for the knowledge which does not
exist]{.underline}**. [This enjoyment appears at the place of the lack
in knowledge, it appears because there is nothing to know
there]{.underline}. In this precise sense, [woman's jouissance is the
signifier of the lack of knowledge (in the Other). It marks the point
where the Other does not know]{.underline}. If there was such a thing as
"sexual relation," this would amount to the existence of its signifier
(knowledge) in the Other, but since there is no sexual relation, there
is this other enjoyment. What this implies is that [the infamous
"feminine jouissance" is not an obstacle to the sexual relation, but a
symptom (or marker) of its nonexistence. No wonder, then, that it has
been subjected to such violent forms of exorcism in the course of
history]{.underline}. This S(Ⱥ), [the other's jouissance as the
signifier of the "Other as barred,"]{.underline} is thus not to be
confused with the signifier of castration (Φ, or the phallic function),
with which a woman also has a relation: "woman has a relation- ship with
S(Ⱥ), and it is already in that respect that she is doubled, that she is
not-whole, since she can also have a relation with Φ" (Lacan 1999, 81).
[The relation with Φ---that is to say, the relation with the
signifier---is the relation on which existence is founded (for any
speaking being), whereas the relation with S(Ⱥ) puts us on the path of
"exsistence]{.underline}." But the point is not simply that a woman only
partly falls under the phallic function, that she is not "whole" in it,
and that part of her remains outside. No, "she is there in full" (ibid.,
74). But [there is something else (en plus), which comes with the
position of being the Other in the sexual relation]{.underline}, and
this supplement---the relation with S(Ⱥ)---[not only detotalizes her,
but also makes her relation with Φ different than in the case of a
man]{.underline}.

#### Human rights discourse sustain a fantasy ignoring what the Other asks of us

**Edkins and Vaughan-William 9** (Jenny Edkins, is Professor of
International Politics at Aberystwyth University, Nick Vaughan-Williams
is Lecturer in International Relations at the University of Exeter,
"Critical Theorists and International Relations," Published 2009,
<https://books.google.com/books/about/Critical_Theorists_and_International_Rel.html?id=6pWsUjCUxe4C>
) //ZoL

However, I think that [Žižek's work]{.underline} (and psychoanalysis)
will play an increasingly important role in international relations in
the field of ethics and human rights. Žižek has recently
[offered]{.underline} a cogent restatement of his [criticisms of the
de-politicizing effects of human rights as they are **framed as attached
to suffering victims who cannot be seen as political agents**. He
questions the type of politicization human rights projects such as
humanitarian interventions]{.underline} (for famine relief or to
alleviate genocide) [provoke against the powers they stand opposed to:
'Do they stand for a different formulation of justice, or do they stand
in opposition to collective justice projects]{.underline}?' (Žižek 2005:
126). For preventing suffering may function as an implicit prohibition
of larger projects of socio-political transformation. One of Žižek's
most provocative claims is that [psychoanalysis]{.underline} is the
privileged discourse for ethics in that it is the only one that does not
rely upon the mechanism of disavowal. Moreover, it presents what
standard ethical treatments exclude: a consideration of the
'uncanniness', 'monstrosity', or 'foreignness' of the neighbour. As such
it [offers a counterpoint to the traditional humanist philosophical
underpinnings of most human rights discourses]{.underline}. Yet neither
Freud nor Lacan were simple advocates of human rights. Lacan proposed
the neologism 'humanhysterianism' (humanitairerie) in the context of a
description of racism as an anxiety ridden defence against the proximity
of the Other's enjoyment (jouissance) (Lacan 1990: 33). Freud too was
deeply mistrustful of national identifications (Žižek 2006b: 256). The
psychoanalytic ethical tradition (represented by Freud, Lacan and Žižek)
differs considerably from the Levinasian deferential respect for an
unknowable or unfathomable Otherness. It resists what Žižek calls 'the
ethical domestication of the neighbour'. Indeed, Žižek would claim that
it is [only psychoanalysis that fully addresses the neighbour in all his
'humanity' which would include his 'disavowed inhumanity']{.underline}.
What is most disruptive to this view of ethics is the suspicion that
there might be something about the neighbour that is incompatible with
universality: '[Every ethics that remains humanist in the name of
avoiding the inhuman core of being human disavows the abyssal dimension
of the neighbour]{.underline}. "Man", "human person" is a mask that
conceals the pure subjectivity of the neighbour' (Žižek 2008: 16). We
are far from the ideas seen in both Derrida and Levinas of an 'infinite
debt' to an abyssal Otherness. Rather, [Žižek]{.underline} and Lacan's
ethical [posture is more neatly resumed by Butler and Stephens as
'correlative to the suspension of the big Other']{.underline} (Butler
and Stephens 2005: 373). We have already noted this at work in the end
point of 'traversing the fantasy'. [If we return to the conception of
fantasy]{.underline} (as construction), [we see that it is one way to
face 'the enigma of the Other']{.underline}. As [we can never know what
the Other wants from us, fantasy fills in the void or covers over the
gap]{.underline}. For Žižek, it gives us an answer to this ultimately
unanswerable question: [It enables us to evade the unbearable deadlock
in which the other wants something from us but we are at the same time
incapable of translating the desire of the Other into a positive
interpellation, into a mandate with which to identify]{.underline}
(Žižek 1989: 114--15). [Fantasy is a double and paradoxical entity: **it
supplies the contours of our desire**]{.underline} (it acts as a frame),
[but it also acts as a defence which helps us confront the 'unbearable
enigma' or over-proximity of the Other's particular way of
enjoying]{.underline}.

**The utopian fantasy relies on the scapegoating and extermination of
stigmatized groups and turn solvency**

**Stavrakakis '99** (Yannis, studied political science at Panteion
University (Athens) and received his MA degree from the Ideology and
Discourse Analysis Programme at the University of Essex, where he also
completed his PhD, "Lacan and the Political," Routledge 1999) //ZoL

In order to answer these questions it is crucial to enumerate the
conditions of possibility and the basic characteristics of [utopian
thinking]{.underline}. First of all it seems that the [need for utopian
meaning arises in periods of increased uncertainty, social instability
and conflict]{.underline}, when the [element of the political subverts
the fantasmatic stability of our political reality]{.underline}.
[Utopias are generated by the surfacing of grave antagonisms and
dislocations in the social field.]{.underline} As Tillich has put it,
**[all utopias strive to negate the negative in human existence; it is
the negative in that existence which makes the idea of utopia
necessary]{.underline}** (Tillich in Levitas, 1990:103). [Utopia then is
one of the possible responses to the everpresent negativity, to the real
antagonism which is constitutive of human experience]{.underline}.
Furthermore, from the time of More's Utopia (1516) it is conceived as an
answer to the negativity inherent in concrete political antagonism. What
is, however, the exact nature of this response? [Utopias are images of
future human communities in which these antagonisms and the dislocations
fuelling them]{.underline} (the element of the political) [will be
forever resolved, leading to a reconciled and harmonious
world]{.underline}. It is not a coincidence that, among others, Fourier
names his utopian community Harmony and that the name of the Owenite
utopian community in the New World was New Harmony. As Marin has put it,
[utopia sets in view an imaginary resolution to social contradiction; it
is a simulacrum of synthesis which dissimulates social antagonism by
projecting it onto a screen representing a harmonious and immobile
equilibrium]{.underline} (Marin, 1984:61). This final resolution is the
essence of the utopian promise. What I will try to do in this chapter
is, first of all, to demonstrate the deeply problematic nature of
utopian politics. Simply put, my argument will be that **[every utopian
fantasy construction needs a scapegoat in order to constitute
itself]{.underline}**. The Nazi utopian fantasy and the production of
the Jew is a good example, especially as pointed out in éiûekís
analysis. 4 [Every utopian fantasy produces its reverse and calls for
its elimination.]{.underline} Put another way, [the beatific side of
fantasy is coupled in utopian constructions with a horrific side, a
paranoid need for a stigmatised scapegoat. The naivety and also the
danger of utopian structures is revealed when the realisation of this
fantasy is attempted]{.underline}. It is then that we are brought close
to the frightening kernel of the real: **[stigmatisation is followed by
extermination]{.underline}**. This is not an accident. [It is inscribed
in the structure of utopian constructions; it seems to be the way all
fantasy constructions work]{.underline}. If in almost all utopian
visions, violence and antagonism are eliminated, if [utopia is based on
the expulsion and repression of violence]{.underline} (this is its
beatific side) this is only [because it owes its own creation to
violence; it is sustained and fed by violence]{.underline} (this is its
horrific side). This repressed moment of violence resurfaces, as Marin
points out, in the difference inscribed in the name utopia itself
(Marin, 1984:110). What we shall argue is that it also resurfaces in the
production of the figure of an enemy. To use a phrase enunciated by the
utopianist Fourier, what is driven out through the door comes back
through the window (is not this a precursor of Lacan's dictum that what
is foreclosed in the symbolic reappears in the real? óVII:131). 5 The
work of Norman Cohn and other historians permits the articulation of a
genealogy of this manichean, equivalential way of understanding the
world, from the great witch-hunt up to modern anti-Semitism, and
Lacanian theory can provide valuable insights into any attempt to
understand the logic behind this utopian operation here the approach to
fantasy developed in Chapter 2 will further demonstrate its potential in
analysing our political experience. In fact, from the time of his
unpublished seminar on The Formations of the Unconscious, [Lacan
identified the utopian dream of a perfectly functioning society as a
highly problematic area]{.underline} (seminar of 18 June 1958).

#### The alternative is to traverse the fantasy -- this spills up to tangible political change, shifting politics away from one focused on escaping loss to one embracing it

**McGowan '13** (Todd, Assoc. Prof. of Film and Television Studies @ U.
of Vermont, Enjoying What We Don't Have: The Political Project of
Psychoanalysis, pp. 208-210)

Like philosophy and Marxism, [psychoanalysis]{.underline} also [has a
history of opposing itself to fantasy]{.underline}. Its basic trajectory
appears to involve curing the patient of an excessive investment in
fantasy life. It seems as if neurotics come to psychoanalysts suffering
from their fantasies and that the sessions allow the neurotics to gain
some distance from these fantasies and thereby see them for what they
are. [Gaining purchase on one's fantasy life --- or simply becoming
aware that one is fantasizing --- is one predominant image of the
psychoanalytic process.]{.underline} My own therapy, for instance,
consisted in gaining awareness of the nonexistence of normal people. The
analyst's unremitting silence in response to my questions about how
everyone else would react in similar situations ultimately allowed me to
recognize the obvious fact that there was no such thing as a normal
reaction or normal person. I was invested in the fantasy of normality
without realizing that it was a fantasy, and [analysis laid this fantasy
bare and thus facilitated a disinvestment in it]{.underline}. In this
way, like so many patients I felt as if I was able to move beyond a
barrier that I did not even know existed. Many theorists who recognize
the political importance of psychoanalysis do so because of its ability
to combat fantasy. For example, this dimension of psychoanalysis leads
Yannis Stavrakakis, in *Lacan and the Political*, to see [the
contemporary political task of psychoanalysis as one of "traversing the
fantasy of utopian thought]{.underline}."25 In the vein of the
philosopher or the Marxist, Stavrakakis sees a danger in the way that
fantasy hides the gap that haunts the symbolic order. As he notes,
"[Fantasy negates the real by promising to 'realise' it, by promising to
close the gap between the real and reality,]{.underline} by [repressing
the discursive nature of reality's production."]{.underline}26 Here,
Stavrakakis sees the ideological dimension of fantasy, and
[psychoanalysis]{.underline} for him [facilitates this recognition and
provides a way to dissolve fantasy's power]{.underline}. This kind of
psychoanalytic politics evinces the attitude toward fantasy that both
modern philosophy and Marxism take up, and this attitude certainly seems
faithful to psychoanalytic practice and its attempt to assist the
subject in "traversing the fantasy."27 But despite the seeming antipathy
directed toward fantasy in its very practice, for psychoanalysis the
political valence of fantasy is not so unambiguous as it is for
philosophy and Marxism. To unlock fully the political potential of
psychoanalysis, we must turn our attention to the positive significance
that psychoanalysis bestows on fantasy. Both philosophy and Marxism are,
of course, right about the role that fantasy has in disguising our
social situatedness. But the problem with this conception of politics is
that, [by focusing on what fantasy conceals, it fails to consider what
fantasy reveals]{.underline}. It is at this point --- [the point of what
fantasy reveals to us --- that we can see the political significance of
psychoanalysis. The value of psychoanalysis in relation to philosophy
lies in the ability of psychoanalysis to grasp the political importance
of fantasy in a way that philosophy and Marxism have been unable to
do]{.underline}. At the same time that [fantasy]{.underline} disguises
our subjection to the signifier and makes it difficult for us to
experience this subjection, it [also has the effect of making otherwise
impossible experiences possible]{.underline}.28 [Fantasy offers the
subject a transcendent experience, and this transcendence, despite its
illusory quality, has a political content. It represents a moment at
which the subject is no longer bound by the limitations of the symbolic
structure that ordinarily constrain it]{.underline}. As such, this
moment of fantasmatic transcendence poses for the subject a fundamental
challenge to the authority of that symbolic structure. In fact, the
radical import of fantasy is located in precisely the same feature that
causes fantasy to further ideology: the illusions of fantasy keep
subjects content with the ruling symbolic structure, but they also
provide a venue for thinking beyond that structure. In contrast to
modern philosophy and Marxism, psychoanalysis permits us to see this
political complexity inhering within the structure of fantasy. From the
beginnings of psychoanalysis, this respect for fantasy makes itself
felt. When it comes to the psyche of the subject in analysis, [the
fantasy has more significance than actual memories]{.underline}. For
instance, Freud's early essay "Screen Memories" describes early
childhood memories as screens for unconscious fantasies. The sexual
content of the fantasy, Freud contends, can only appear through the
vehicle of a genuine memory. He writes: "It is precisely the coarsely
sensual element in the phantasy which explains why it . . . must be
content to find its way allusively and under a fl owery disguise into a
childhood scene."29 Freud's point here is not that we must subtract the
distortion of fantasy from the memory in order to discover what actually
happened but that what actually happened has far less psychic importance
than the fantasy it conceals. The subject uses the memory of a genuine
scene to access and at the same time disguise a fantasy. Fantasy
distorts, but its distortion embodies subjectivity itself and transports
the subject outside the constraints of actual experience, which is why
Freud values it over memory. This valuation is part of the implicit
political project inhering within psychoanalytic thought, and it
distances the politics of psychoanalysis from other political projects
rooted in the Enlightenment. [Because it allows the subject an
experience of transcendence beyond the limits of the ruling symbolic
structure, fantasy has tangible political benefits]{.underline}. These
benefits can be characterized in three related ways: (1) thro[ugh
fantasy, we experience alternatives to the ruling symbolic structure
that remain unthinkable within this structure]{.underline}; (2) [fantasy
facilitates an encounter with traumatic disruption that our everyday
reality guards against]{.underline}; and (3) [fantasy makes evident the
link between loss and enjoyment, allowing us to conceive of a politics
that embraces loss rather than attempting to escape it.]{.underline}
These [political dimensions of fantasy]{.underline} all
[manifest]{.underline} themselves in [the thought of]{.underline} Freud
and [Lacan, even though neither conceives of fantasy]{.underline} (or
psychoanalysis as a whole) in a political sense.

#### Fantasy allows us to break down conceptions of gender

**McGowan '13** (Todd, Assoc. Prof. of Film and Television Studies @ U.
of Vermont, Enjoying What We Don't Have: The Political Project of
Psychoanalysis, pp. 212-213)

[This ability to transcend the ideological limits of the present
animates the fantasy that Le Guin constructs in her novel The Left Hand
of Darkness.]{.underline} Written in 1969, during the incipience of the
consciousness-raising movement in American feminism, [this novel
envisions a world that reveals the ultimate contingency of all gender
characteristics.]{.underline} Le Guin tells the novel's story through
the character of Genly Ai, who is an alien envoy to the planet Winter
(or Gethen, in the language of the inhabitants). In general, the
inhabitants of Winter have no sexual identity. For twenty-two days of
the month, the Gethenians exist in a state of sexual inactivity in which
they are neither male nor female. During the remaining days of the
month, they enter into a wholly sexual phase known as *kemmer*. In this
phase, the Gethenians can take on either a male or a female sexual
identity, but it is only during these few days of the month that they
are sexed beings. Perhaps the most significant feature of this
fantasmatic scenario is that it totally befuddles the perception of an
outsider such as Genly Ai, the foreign envoy to Winter. [As a sexed
being]{.underline} (a male), [Genly Ai finds it difficult to perceive
identity without the gender characteristics that he associates with
sexual difference. He describes his own inability to perceive the people
of Winter without ascribing them a gender identity]{.underline}: "Though
I had been nearly two years on Winter I was still far from being able to
see the people of the planet through their own eyes. [I tried to, but my
efforts took the form of self-consciously seeing a Gethenian first as a
man, then as a woman, forcing him into those categories so irrelevant to
his nature and so essential to my own."]{.underline}32 [This failure to
see the Gethenian correctly indicates the power of gender-oriented
thinking over human perception, but the novel also points toward another
possibility, the possibility of depriving gender identity of the role
that it has in our thought. Through its depiction of a world that
eschews gender definition while retaining sexual reproduction, The Left
Hand of Darkness allows readers to see the groundlessness of gender as
such. In the fantasy that Le Guin constructs]{.underline} in the novel,
[gender becomes not simply arbitrary but unattached to
subjectivity]{.underline}, and this works to reveal its contingent and
ultimately insignificant status. [Through the imagining of a world that
exists without male and female gender categories, Le Guin imagines what
patriarchal ideology renders unthinkable and thereby defies its
unthinkable status]{.underline}. In this sense, [the fantasmatic
dimension of Le Guin's novel functions as a political act, opening up
possibilities that patriarchal ideology foreclosed]{.underline}.
