# Circumvention -- CNDI 2019

## Toolbox 

### 1NC -- Transfers

#### Weapon transfers inevitable -- loans and lease agreements circumvent sales embargoes. 

**Holden 16** \[Paul Holden, "Indefensible: Seven Myths that Sustain the
Global Arms Trade", Zed Books Ltd., Sep 15, 2016, Google Books\]

The treaty only covers **[sales]{.underline}**. This [**is distinct**
from covering other forms of arms transfer]{.underline} we've discussed
above, [such as weapons that are **loaned, leased, bartered or given as
part of an aid package**]{.underline}. [The treaty also excludes arms
transferred as part of a \"**defense cooperation
agreement'**,]{.underline} that is, an arrangement [where the militaries
of two countries work together. It would be easy for most states to
simply claim that controversial weapons sales fall under the rubric of
these sorts of agreements and bypass the treaty altogether.]{.underline}

#### **Non-commercial transfers kill solvency.**

4\. Circumventing the ATT: [gifts, loans, and leases of
arms]{.underline} [The scope of the]{.underline} draft
[treaty]{.underline} is such that it [could be viewed as **excluding
non-commercial transfers**, within which category could fall loans,
gifts, and military aid]{.underline}. This means that [States could
donate or lend weapons to other countries]{.underline} irrespective of
whether the recipient would be likely to use them for serious violations
of human rights, international humanitarian law, or in supporting
terrorist acts. [While data relating to gifting, lending, and donating
weapons by governments is not widely available, it is clear that **these
kinds of transfers are a fact of life** in the international arms
trade]{.underline}. As the case study below illustrates, [governments
across the world are **routinely engaging** in these types of
transfers]{.underline}, with potentially serious implications for the
effectiveness of a future ATT.

### 1NC -- DoD 

#### DOD will circumvent -- tons of secret programs.

**Lumpe 10** \[Lora Lumpe, "U.S. Military Aid to Central Asia,
1999--2009: Security Priorities Trump Human Rights and Diplomacy", Open
Society Foundation, Occasional Paper Series No. 1, October 2010,
https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/uploads/f405dbbf-18c6-470e-a4fa-505313014346/OPS-No-1-20101015_0.pdf\]

Gordon Adams, former associate director for international affairs and
national security programs at the Office of Management and Budget,
estimated that 15 different Pentagon programs would provide \$8.6
billion in military aid worldwide during 2009---outstripping the similar
programs that operate under State Department authority.36 It turns out
he was undercounting. [A]{.underline} 2009 [DOD handbook on "security
cooperation" identifies at least **49 programs and authorities (read:
pots of money)** that the DOD can now utilize to arm and train foreign
forces]{.underline}.37 [The military committees of
Congress]{.underline}, acting at the behest of the Pentagon, [include in
their annual DOD funding bills provisions that grant the Pentagon the
right to use certain amounts of DOD]{.underline} Operations and
Maintenance [funds for foreign military aid programs]{.underline}.38
Many of the new DOD-funded programs that Congress has authorized in the
past decade directly parallel State Department--funded programs. But
with these, **[the Pentagon is "the decider"]{.underline}** (in
President Bush's words) [about who gets aid, as well as the
implementer.]{.underline}

While U.S. law caps these authorities at certain amounts, [there are no
public reports on most of these programs, so determining actual
expenditure levels and programming is difficult]{.underline}.39 As a
result, [piecing together the entire picture of U.S. military
aid]{.underline} to, and involvement with, Central Asia [is very complex
and perhaps not even possible. **This opacity also means that such funds
could be used when Congress directs a cessation of other military aid
accounts for a particular country.**]{.underline}

[In addition to the specific and constantly growing budgetary discretion
that regional combatant commanders have obtained in the past two
decades, there are **numerous nonspecific funds** that they can use to
**reward friends and allies** and/or buy or maintain access to local
ports]{.underline}, bases, and logistics depots. [Because there is **no
public reporting** required on the expenditures of most of these funds,
meaningful public oversight is not possible, and even **Congressional
oversight is questionable**]{.underline}.40

[Congress has applied some human rights provisions to]{.underline} the
new [military aid programs]{.underline} funded by the DOD laws and
budget. Namely, since 1999, Congress has included a version of the
"Leahy Law" in each of the annual DOD appropriations acts. [This
provision requires that the Pentagon have a process for background
vetting]{.underline} that is intended to ensure that U.S. forces are not
training any units of a foreign security force that have been credibly
alleged to have committed a gross violation of human rights. [The
DOD]{.underline}, however, [**does not consider many of the programs
whereby it conveys skills, equipment, or resources to foreign militaries
to be "assistance"** and, therefore, **does not vet participants** in
those programs.]{.underline}41

### 1NC -- CCL

#### Circumvention -- Trump will transfer munitions to the CCL.

**Abramson 19** \[Jeff Abramson, 2-20-2019, \"Congress should block rule
changes for firearm exports,\" TheHill,
https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/430829-congress-should-block-rule-changes-for-firearm-exports\]

As the nation is reminded of the tragic consequences of gun violence
with the one-year anniversary of the Parkland school shooting, the
[Trump administration is pushing forward with plans to expedite the
export abroad of]{.underline} the same kind of [military-style
weapons]{.underline} used in many of the mass shootings that have taken
place in recent years.

These are not the commodities that the United States should make easier
to export.

Congress can and should stop [the changes]{.underline}, which [would
**put the Department of Commerce in charge of regulating these
exports,** removing them from the]{.underline} State Department-led U.S.
Munitions List (**[USML]{.underline}**).

[At the core of these proposed changes is the]{.underline} mistaken
[belief that firearms **do not merit tighter scrutiny** under the State
Department-led munitions control list because they are neither high-tech
nor do they provide unique military advantages.]{.underline}

Of course, [the changes would also make it easier for gun manufacturers
to sell and profit from these weapons transfers.]{.underline}

In reality, [these are some of the weapons that fuel criminal violence,
civil conflict and facilitate human right abuses by authoritarian
governments around the world.]{.underline}

In response, Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), ranking member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, introduced the \"Stopping the Traffic in
Overseas Proliferation of Ghost Guns Act\" that would prohibit the
removal of firearms from the State Department-led list.

Menendez argues: \"Every terrorist and criminal that wants to hijack an
airplane with Americans on board will more easily be able to smuggle
3D-printed, virtually undetectable guns aboard. Every school, every
government facility, every hospital, here and abroad, will become even
more vulnerable to gun violence through this change. This is madness."

Over in the House, Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), chair of the House
Foreign Affairs Committee, and Rep. Norma Torres (D-Calif.) have
introduced a similar measure, the \"Prevent Crime and Terrorism Act.\"

They say: "We need proper congressional oversight, so we can step in and
make sure these weapons aren't sent to bad actors, including terrorists,
drug cartels, human rights abusers or violent criminals.\" They are
right.

Under current State Department implementation, online plans for 3-D
printed guns are traditionally deemed an export and therefore regulated.
The administration\'s attempt last year to allow Defense Distributed to
post 3-D printing plans led to public outrage and lawsuits that have
thus far blocked this from changing.

[Putting the Commerce Department in charge would be an **end-around
approach that effectively leads to deregulation**, in part because
Commerce would not have incentive to protect copyrights]{.underline}
when 3-D print advocates are instead pushing to make their weapons
designs freely available.

[Transfer of export control to Commerce would also remove Congress from
their current oversight role. Today, Congress is notified of potential
commercial sales of firearms under USML category I]{.underline} when
they were valued at just \$1 million, **[but no such notifications exist
for items on the Commerce Control List.]{.underline}**

A 30-day review period has started on the rules, started when the
administration sent them to Congress on Feb. 4. Senator Menendez is
expected to put a \"hold\" on the rule changes, but more permanent
legislation, such as those acts now introduced in both chambers, is a
better long-term approach.

If not halted or significantly changed, [the new rules would risk the
safety of people both at home and abroad and continue the cynical
approach of the Trump administration to **treat weapons as any other
trade commodity**, upsetting decades of more-responsible U.S. arms
transfer policy.]{.underline}

### 1NC -- Vagueness 

#### [Vague]{.underline} restrictions fail

**Morley 19**, \[Assistant Professor of Law, Florida State University
College of Law. Climenko Fellow and Lecturer on Law, Harvard Law School,
2012-14, DEFEATING THE EXECUTIVE NONDELEGATION DOCTRINE,
https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3292007&download=yes\]

Nearly a century of precedent has hollowed out the nondelegation
doctrine, rendering it an easily-satisfied formality that falls far
short of fulfilling its important structural functions. So long as the
Supreme Court maintains its current interpretation of the doctrine,
however, Congress may foreclose recurring periodic challenges such as
Gundy by simply enacting a background statute to provide a default set
of general, yet constitutionally sufficient restrictions on delegations
of discretionary authority to federal officials outside the legislative
branch. Such [restrictions]{.underline} arguably [should already be
implicit in otherwise unrestricted]{.underline} statutory
[grants]{.underline} of discretionary authority. And the fact that [such
**vague**, **indeterminate restrictions** are **unlikely** to
**meaningfully constrain** executive discretion]{.underline} simply
underscores the insufficiency of the modern nondelegation doctrine.
Nevertheless, given the current state of the caselaw, the proposed
amendment is a simple, fairly uncontroversial means of eliminating at
least one type of alleged constitutional defect throughout the rest of
the U.S. Code.

## Blocks 

### 2NC -- Circumvention -- General 

#### Trump [won't comply]{.underline} -- enforcement causes [political violence]{.underline}, [democracy collapse]{.underline}, and [court entrenchment]{.underline}

**Huq 18**, \[Aziz Huq teaches law at the University of Chicago Law
School and is co-author of How to Save a Constitutional Democracy. Tom
Ginsburg teaches law at the University of Chicago Law School and is
co-author of How to Save a Constitutional Democracy, Democrats Want to
Investigate Trump. Here's Why They Should Be Careful., [November
9^th^]{.underline},
https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/11/09/democrats-investigate-trump-222402\]

Historically, [when the executive]{.underline} branch has **[refused to
comply]{.underline}** with an information request, [Congress has had two
means of enforcing]{.underline} subpoenas.

First, a chamber has used its constitutional authority to enforce
contempt orders by [arresting an executive official]{.underline}. In
February 1889, for example, the House's sergeant-at-arms forcibly
brought former Minister to China George Seward to the House for
impeachment proceedings after he appeared but failed to produce
documents sought by the committee.

Today, the idea of the House's sergeant-at-arms physically restraining
an executive branch official [seems **jarring**ly
inappropriate]{.underline}, to say the least. [Such]{.underline} a move
[would]{.underline} likely **[stoke]{.underline}** the
**[violence]{.underline}** that has been [bubbling]{.underline} away,
tragically, in U.S. political rhetoric and [in]{.underline} the actions
of some [fringe groups]{.underline}. It is thus a tool that is no longer
consistent with the (benign) norms of our present political culture---to
say nothing of its political cost. [We see no merit to this
path.]{.underline}

Congress' second option is to [go to the federal courts]{.underline}.
For instance, when Bush II White House officials Harriet Miers and Josh
Bolton declined to provide information about the allegedly improper
firing of U.S. attorneys, the House Judiciary Committee sued---and
initially prevailed in federal District Court.

But [the judicial safeguard]{.underline} against the excessive or
abusive deployment of executive privilege [is **illusory**]{.underline}
for three reasons. First, the judiciary since the 1970s has been leery
of ordering officials to produce information. In the Miers/Bolton
matter, for example, the Court of Appeals stayed
proceedings---effectively extinguishing the possibility that either
official would be forced to produce information. [Even in
the]{.underline} more [liberal 1970s]{.underline}, in the immediate wake
of the Nixon case, [courts took **pains** to **avoid
confrontation**]{.underline} with the executive.

Second, [litigation takes]{.underline} months or [**years**. It
is]{.underline} always [possible for the executive to **run the clock**
on the House---which has a **two-year life**]{.underline} by law---[by
**appealing**, dickering and **delaying**, until an issue]{.underline}
has **[lost]{.underline}** its **[political legs.]{.underline}**

Finally, and most troubling, if [the House]{.underline} ultimately
presses its case beyond the District Courts and the Courts of Appeal it
[is likely to face a Supreme Court]{.underline} perhaps [inclined to
**radically expand** the executive's **immunity**]{.underline} from
oversight. Recall that there is no textual basis in the Constitution for
"executive privilege." Moreover, the relevant history and judicial
precedent are quite hazy. As a result, the John Roberts Supreme Court is
unfettered by law when it comes to expanding executive privilege---or
even when it comes to creating new privileges from whole cloth. It is
perhaps a bellwether that Justice Brett Kavanaugh has already intimated
a sweeping view of the privilege---a view that might shape the court's
ultimate decisions.

The [harm]{.underline} from such decisions [would be **long term** and
**structural**.]{.underline} The resulting [legal rulings]{.underline}
would [impose]{.underline} permanent, potentially [**disabling**,
**constraints** on Congress' ability to ensure]{.underline} that this
presidency---or **[any]{.underline}** future
[administration]{.underline}---has [acted under]{.underline} the rule of
[law]{.underline}. The immediate case for such constraints has only
swelled with Matthew Whitaker's assumption of control over special
counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. But those [rulings
would]{.underline} more [**permanently insulate** bad actors in the
executive]{.underline} [from **oversight**]{.underline}---a lasting
prospect neither liberals nor conservatives should relish.

At the same time, the [political costs of]{.underline} such a (likely)
[**doomed confrontation** for the House would be
**substantial**]{.underline}. Just as the president has tarred the free
press as "enemies of the people," so [he will claim the mantle of
**victimhood** when]{.underline} [confronted]{.underline} by a Congress
that is anything other than a lapdog. The Sessions ouster makes such
confrontation more likely, as perhaps the president anticipates (and
relishes). The resulting [politics of comparative victimhood is a game
at which Trump **excels**]{.underline}---and so is a contest that [the
**House will** likely **lose**.]{.underline} We see nothing salutary
coming from such confrontations over basic tenets of the rule of law.

#### There are tons of [non-transparent]{.underline} and [secretive]{.underline} ways the executive can [sell weapons]{.underline}

Accessed 6 July 2019.) SK

Over time, [Presidents]{.underline} and their advisors [have been
inventive in their use of government resources and agencies, as well as
outside actors, to deliver various aspects of the shadow policy. To stay
within the bounds of law (and circumvent Congress), for example, the
Reagan Administration turned to members of its National Security Council
to carry out the Iran Contra project---which involved surreptitious
supply of weapons to both Iran and the Nicaraguan Contras.]{.underline}
Although the Boland Amendment explicitly forbid using appropriated funds
and engaging US intelligence agencies to overthrow the Nicaraguan
government, [NSC]{.underline} conspirator [secretly sold US weapons to
Iran and diverted the proceeds to arm the Contras.]{.underline}68 In the
same period, [the US persuaded Saudi Arabia to pay for millions of AK-47
assault rifles and other lig weapons to be channeled to the Afghan
mujahideen through Pakistani intelligence services.]{.underline}69
[During the 1990's covert supplies to Bosnia-Hersegovina appear to have
involved the US Force in some measure]{.underline}, and possibly US
Special Forces under control of the Pentagon. According to the Dutch
government's 2002 report on the massacre at Srebrenica, it is not clear
what nation's pilots flew the Hercules C-130 cargo planes that ferried
ammunition, machine g Stingers and other light weaponry on "black
flights to Tuzla" in clear violation of a UN arms embargo, but the
success of those flights definitely required aversion of AWAC
surveillance under US control.70 Ten years later, Bosnia was faced with
the challenge of disposing of its wartime stocks of light weaponry, and
recent reports from Amnesty International suggest that at least some of
them were authorized by US military officers serving under NATO auspices
for transfer to Rwanda and Iraq.71 Yet more recently, [questions have
been raised about US covert activities in Somalia]{.underline}, under a
UN arms embargo since 1992. [Sizable payments by CIA agents to Somali
warlords]{.underline} in exchange for information about Al Qaeda
operatives [are thought to have financed illicit weapons that fueled
open hostilities in 2006.]{.underline}72 Stories circulating in 2007
further suggest that [the US with Saudi Arabia has clandestinely armed
Fatah al-Islam in Lebanon.]{.underline}73 As intimated, the features of
a shadow transfer may vary according to circumstances. Some involve
covert operations; some do not. Several programs created in conjunction
with the war on terror appear to lend themselves to shadow transfers
even if they do not extend from formally declared covert operations. The
first is a military training [program known as "Section
1206"]{.underline} training, which [permits the Pentagon to train and
equip foreign military personnel without going through the State
Department's normal screening procedures.]{.underline}74 As detailed in
administration budget requests, [the "Global Train and Equip" program
includes the supply of small arms and light weapons to
partners]{.underline} in the war on terror [whose human rights
record]{.underline}, risks for diversion, or other concerns [might make
them ineligible for assistance under the Conventional Arms Transfer
guidelines.]{.underline}75 [Given the attenuation of normal State
Department vetting procedures and limited opportunity for Congressional
review, it is doubtful that such transfers are subject to the full set
of cradle-to-grave oversight measures outlined in the principled
policy.]{.underline} It is even less likely that accountability is
established for any weapons transferred or purchased u the authority of
a second program, known as Coalition Support Funds. This military aid
program works on a cash basis to reimburse coalition partners for
outlays related to their counterterrorist operations as well as for
military support in Iraq and Afghanistan, including ammunition as well
as fuel, security and airlift. [Pakistan, Poland, Jordan, Afghanistan,
Uzbekistan, Georgia, Ukraine, Czech Republic, and Djibouti are among the
countries that have benefited from this program.]{.underline} nder m o
volved. 76 It is doubtful that weapons air-lifted by the US military and
CIA to various anti-Taliban troops in Afghanistan in the fall of 2001
were subject to the most robust provisions of the small arms transfer
policy, and reports suggest that [President Bush may have authorized a
covert action to bypass requirements associated with more public forms
of military assistance.]{.underline}77 In the intervening years, though,
[several programs openly authorizing transfer of defense articles to
Iraqi and Afghan security forces also appear to bypass the most
stringent requirements of formal policy]{.underline},78 especially where
non-US weapons may be involved. In fact, [over the past several decades
numerous transfers have involved supply of defense articles that cannot
be identified as American weapons.]{.underline} During the Cold War
years, there were several reasons not to want such weapons traced back
to the US. In the early 1960's, for example, [the US wanted to hide its
involvement in the Angolan nationalist struggle from Portuguese colonial
rulers]{.underline} (and NATO ally) [and so disguised the provenance
of]{.underline} financial support and [arms supplied to Holden
Roberto.]{.underline}79 [Stockpiles of weapons acquired during the
Vietnam war facilitated clandestine and disguised
transfers]{.underline}, but the US also procured AK-47's from Egypt for
use in Afghanistan and Iran-Contra conspirators went to some lengths to
procure Chinese MANPADS for supply to Nicaragua.80 Since 2003 the US has
supplied more than 200,000 Soviet-style light weapons to Iraq through a
grant program,81 but that choice is presumably motivated by various
practicalities, including the desire to provide weapons that are
familiar or can be acquired cheaply. In this analysis I have treated
shadow transfers as a residual category. In some way or another, [all
shadow transactions fall outside the bounds of requirements codified in
the arms export or foreign assistance laws.]{.underline} In some cases
these transfers are made public, but they are excused from the most
rigorous requirement of law, including "cradle to grave" surveillance.
[Most shadow transfers additionally share a marked lack of
transparency]{.underline} \--which, of course, makes the US rating on
the SAS Transparency Barometer especially ironic. Details about
particular supply operations are held tightly, even if the transfer
itself complies with American law. [Information is not always shared
with the public]{.underline} (indeed, emergent information may be
denied), [and in some cases pertinent details may be withheld from most
members of Congress as well.]{.underline} Presidential directives are
usually classified documents, and Intelligence Committees in the Senate
and the House are not at liberty to discuss information shared with them
in camera.

### 2NC -- Circumvention -- BPC 

#### Building Partner Capacity programs are growing now and cause circumvention -- we'll use it to equip countries anyway.

**McInnis & Lucas 15** \[Kathleen J. McInnis, Coordinator, Analyst in
International Security, Nathan J. Lucas, Section Research Manager, "What
Is "Building Partner Capacity?" Issues for Congress", Congressional
Research Service, December 18, 2015,
https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R44313.pdf\]

A number of reasons underlie a growing Congressional interest in the
complex national security policy area that has come to be labeled
"Building Partnership Capacity," or "BPC." First, since 2006 [BPC has
**increased in prominence** within U.S. strategy]{.underline}, arguably
[becoming a **central pillar** of U.S. national security and foreign
policy in recent years]{.underline}. Following the terrorist attacks on
September 11, 2001, [successive U.S. and Department of Defense leaders
concluded that the traditional set of security assistance and security
cooperation tools did not meet the needs of the changed strategic
landscape]{.underline}. The term "Building Partnership Capacity" was
coined in the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review. Since then, [BPC has
become a **catchall phrase for a wide array of programs**]{.underline},
1 [all underpinned by the assumption that strengthening foreign security
institutions in weak and fragile states will have tangible positive
benefits for U.S. national security. Activities in which DOD engages
toward those ends include (but are not limited to):]{.underline}
training, mentoring, advising, **[equipping]{.underline}**, exercising,
educating and planning with [foreign security forces]{.underline},
primarily in fragile and weak states. BPC is also used to describe a
core element of recent U.S. military campaigns---namely, training and
equipping foreign security forces---in Iraq (2003-2011), Afghanistan
(2001-present) and Iraq/Syria (2014-present).

Despite the increasing emphasis on, and centrality of, BPC in national
security strategy and military operations, the assumption that building
foreign security forces will have tangible U.S. national security
benefits remains a relatively untested proposition. This leads to the
second reason for growing Congressional interest: neither the policy nor
academic communities have explored in great detail whether or not
Building Partner Capacity works to achieve U.S. strategic objectives.
Recent events, particularly the battle between the Afghan government and
the Taliban over Konduz, as well as the collapse of U.S.-trained and
equipped forces in Iraq and Syria in the face of the Islamic State, have
called into question whether these BPC programs can achieve their
desired effects.2 Do BPC programs and activities actually advance U.S.
national security interests? If so, when? If not, why not?

This leads to the third reason for increased Congressional interest in
BPC and related programs: fiscal oversight. [The relative intellectual
and programmatic ambiguity of these efforts make it difficult to
understand what, specifically, the DOD is doing to build partner
capacity in fragile states. Answering the question, "what is BPC?" is
surprisingly difficult]{.underline}, as definitions of BPC vary across
the U.S. government. [This **uncertainty**]{.underline}, in turn, [makes
it difficult to understand what, specifically, DOD is spending on BPC
and related programs.]{.underline} While Congress has authorized over
\$100 billion toward higher profile BPC missions in Iraq, Afghanistan
and Syria since 2001, [DOD continues to execute BPC missions in
countries around the globe]{.underline}. In some instances, components
of DOD have begun augmenting its force structure in order to better
conduct current and future BPC missions. [As DOD budgets generally
reflect inputs rather than outputs or outcomes, these BPC expenditures
are **difficult to identify and account for**]{.underline}; this, in
turn, creates challenges in determining whether it constitutes a
cost-effective policy option.

#### BPC is prioritized now -- we'll use it to secure alliances.

**McInnis & Lucas 15** \[Kathleen J. McInnis, Coordinator, Analyst in
International Security, Nathan J. Lucas, Section Research Manager, "What
Is "Building Partner Capacity?" Issues for Congress", Congressional
Research Service, December 18, 2015,
https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R44313.pdf\]

Since 2001, [successive U.S. administrations have **increasingly
prioritized** efforts to build foreign security
forces]{.underline}---particularly in weak and failing states---arguing
that doing so advances U.S. national security objectives. In turn,
[the]{.underline} Department of Defense ([DOD]{.underline}) [has
**invested billions of dollars in "Building Partner Capacity,"** a term
that refers to a broad set of]{.underline} missions,
[programs]{.underline}, activities, and authorities [intended to
**improve the ability of other nations to achieve those
security-oriented goals** they share with the United
States]{.underline}. As a consequence, these efforts and programs have
been a growing focus of Congressional attention. Many partner capacity
building programs and activities have their roots in the post-World War
II period, if not well before, yet today they are implemented more
widely, and often with greater resourcing, than efforts prior to
September 11, 2001. Indeed, [building partner capacity was a central
feature of the]{.underline} 2003-2010 [Iraq campaign, and is a core
component of the ongoing current campaigns]{.underline} both in
Afghanistan [to counter Al Qaeda and the Taliban, and]{.underline} in
Iraq/Syria [to counter the Islamic State.]{.underline}

Recent events, particularly the battle between the Afghan government and
the Taliban over Konduz, the inability of DOD-led efforts to produce
more than a "handful" of anti-Assad, antiIslamic State (IS) forces in
Syria, and the collapse of U.S.-trained forces in Iraq in the face of
the Islamic State, have called into question---including in the
Congress---whether these BPC programs can ever achieve their desired
effects. CRS surveyed the publicly available literature on the subject,
and found the debate on the strategic effectiveness of BPC and related
programs nascent, at best. While a variety of studies explore
programmatic effectiveness, very few explore what the United States
sought to achieve when engaging in a BPC effort, and whether or not
doing so led to desirable outcomes.

[The increasing emphasis that the U.S. government is placing on BPC as a
means to achieve strategic goals]{.underline}, combined with the paucity
of the literature on this subject, prompted CRS to explore the
historical track record of BPC efforts to help determine whether they
produced outcomes consistent with U.S. strategic objectives. Twenty case
studies since World War II were explored; each was grouped according to
one of seven strategic goals that U.S. sought to accomplish. These goals
included

 victory in war/war termination,

 managing regional security challenges,

 indirectly supporting a party to a conflict,

 conflict mitigation,

 enhancing coalition participation,

 building institutional and interpersonal linkages, and

 alliance building.

Given that U.S. leaders often argue that a BPC effort could help
accomplish more than one of the above goals, determining what
constitutes the "primary" strategic objective for a given BPC effort
required analytic judgment. CRS organized the cases according to public
statements at the time, with particular attention paid to how leaders
described the purpose of the BPC effort. Effectiveness was judged based
on two criteria: whether the strategic goal was achieved, and whether
the effort produced unintended consequences that were obviously and
meaningfully damaging to U.S. national interests. Within the case
studies explored, [BPC]{.underline} was least effective as a tool for
allowing the United States to extract itself from conflict (victory in
war/war termination). However, it [was most effective as a **tool for
building interpersonal and institutional linkages, and for alliance
building**.]{.underline}

[For decades, the United States has used **military aid and security
cooperation** to secure peaceful relations between Israel and
Egypt.]{.underline} Since the 1979 Israeli-Egyptian Peace Treaty, [the
United States has provided Egypt and Israel with **large amounts of
military assistance**]{.underline} and has inaugurated a number of joint
programs and exercises designed to increase U.S. bilateral institutional
closeness with both countries. In the case of Egypt, [U.S. policymakers
have routinely justified aid as an investment in regional
stability]{.underline}, built primarily on long-running military
cooperation and on sustaining the treaty---principles that are supposed
to be mutually reinforcing. For Israel, [U.S. military aid has helped
transform the Israeli armed forces into one of the most
**technologically sophisticated militaries** in the world.]{.underline}
U.S. military aid has been designed to maintain Israel's "qualitative
military edge" (QME) over neighboring militaries. [The rationale for QME
is that Israel must rely on **better equipment** and training to
compensate for being much smaller geographically and in terms of
population than its potential adversaries]{.underline}.119

For Egypt, the United States has provided Foreign Military Financing
(FMF) grants of approximately \$1.3 billion per year and International
Military Education and Training grants of between \$1 and 2 million per
year since the mid-1980s. However, the military-to-military relationship
has, in the past two decades, received less U.S. emphasis than one might
expect to achieve the strategic aim of conflict prevention. The last
significant U.S.-Egyptian joint military operation was in 1991, when
Egypt contributed 20,000 troops to Operation Desert Storm.120 As the
United States continually engages in military operations against
terrorist groups across the broader Middle East, the U.S. military, in
particular, seeks partners that can provide "irregular" warfare
capabilities including intelligence, training, and counterinsurgency
support. Yet analysts consider the Egyptian armed forces to be more
oriented to fight interstate than asymmetric warfare.

[For Israel, the United States has provided FMF grants]{.underline} of
between \$1.8 billion and \$3.1 billion per year [since the mid-1980s.
The United States and Israel also have jointly developed missile defense
programs, for which **the United States has allowed Israel to use FMF
funds to purchase weapons systems**.]{.underline} While the 1979
Memoranda of Agreement (out of the Camp David Accords) between Israel
and the United States says "the United States will endeavor to take into
account and will endeavor to be responsive to military and economic
assistance requirements of Israel," 121 [U.S. military aid to Israel has
more closely followed the model of]{.underline} military sales and
[financing]{.underline} to developed countries (for example, NATO
Allies) than the BPC concept, found in the 2006 QDR, of "maintaining a
long-term, low-visibility presence in many areas of the world where U.S.
forces do not traditionally operate." It is also unclear as to the
extent to which U.S. military aid to Israel, given Israel's own defense
spending and capabilities development (as well as a significantly
changed political environment in the Middle East), would play a role in
preventing conflict between Israel and Egypt since 1979.

### 2NC -- Circumvention -- CCL 

#### **CCL transfer kills export controls and oversight -- doesn't require a license.**

**Hartung 13** \[William D. Hartung, director of the Common Defense
Campaign: Arms &amp; Security Project at the Center for International
Policy, 8-21-2013, \"Voices,\" Open Society Foundations,
https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/risks-loosening-arms-export-controls-far-outweigh-benefits\]

An Obama administration [plan to loosen U.S. arms export controls could
make it easier for weapons to find their way into the wrong
hands]{.underline}---a risk that far outweighs the measure's paltry
economic benefits.

In August 2009, the administration launched the Export Control Reform
Initiative (ECRI), designed to streamline U.S. arms export controls,
enhance national security, and grow the economy.

[The administration]{.underline} said it [wanted to **eliminate or
reduce controls** on items of limited national security
concern]{.underline} while increasing controls on more dangerous
exports. The policy is being implemented in stages and the first round
of changes will take effect in October.

But the administration's proposed reforms are unlikely to accomplish
either goal, according to a report issued by the Center for
International Policy, with support from the Open Society Foundations.

[The loosening of arms export controls is being justified on the grounds
that selling U.S.-made weapons and parts to America's potential military
adversaries does not pose a significant security threat]{.underline} as
long as the exports are nearly obsolete or readily available.

This narrow focus on controlling the flow of modern equipment ignores
the danger of giving countries of concern access to less sophisticated
weapons and components. Iran, for example, wants spare parts to keep its
aged American-made fighter jets and attack helicopters flying. China
wants older technology that it can copy and manufacture. Other regimes
want the means of daily repression, like low-tech guns and
communications and surveillance equipment.

Under the envisioned Obama reforms, **[none of these items would be kept
behind the fence of U.S. export controls.]{.underline}**

[A central element of the administration's new policy has been to move
thousands of items from the]{.underline} United States Munitions List
([USML]{.underline})---a compendium of arms and arms-related
technologies monitored by the State Department---[to the]{.underline}
Commerce Control List ([CCL), which subjects equipment destined for
export to **less rigorous scrutiny.**]{.underline}

In fact, [the White House has asserted that it eventually intends to
permit a significant percentage of the items that are now being
transferred off of the USML to be exported **without a license**. This
means that **oversight would be lifted from these items.**]{.underline}

To promote the reform package, the administration is touting its
economic benefits. A former assistant secretary of state for
political-military affairs, Andrew Shapiro, has argued that the
administration's export control reform would "have a real impact on our
economy at a time when competition is even more fierce and at a time
when our manufacturing base could really use a boost."

But neither the administration nor the arms and aerospace industries,
the major supporters of the export reform effort, have provided credible
evidence that loosening controls will have substantial economic
benefits.

In fact, there is strong evidence to suggest that export reform is
unlikely to significantly increase U.S. sales of military technology.
The United States already accounts for nearly 80 percent of the global
arms market. Even a radical reform of arms export controls is unlikely
to push that figure much higher. As one business analyst has noted, the
economic benefits of arms export reform, if they exist at all, are
likely to be "infinitesimal."

It is even possible that loosening restrictions on arms exports could
reduce U.S. employment. Thomas Buffenbarger, president of the
International Association of Machinists, the union which represents the
bulk of the workers in the arms and aerospace industries, has warned
that "the less stringent controls provided under the CCL could lead to
further transfers of technology or production from the U.S. to another
country," with potentially devastating consequences for U.S.-based
production and employment.

#### **Regulatory changes get weapons through without FMS or DCS -- lack of transparency guarantees circumvention.**

**Abramson 18** \[Jeff Abramson, nonresident senior fellow, 6-7-2018,
\"Trump Favors Arms Industry in Effort to Loosen Export Controls,\" Arms
Control Association,
https://www.armscontrol.org/issue-briefs/2018-06/trump-favors-arms-industry-effort-loosen-export-controls\]

[The Trump administration is pushing to make sweeping changes in U.S.
conventional arms export policies in order to sell more weapons, more
quickly, and]{.underline} typically [with **less transparency and
oversight**]{.underline}. One reason given for these changes---advancing
economic security---is simply faulty.

Worse still, [the policies]{.underline} are dangerous, [creating new
risks that these weapons end up in the hands of terrorists and
international criminals]{.underline} and further undermining the
promotion of human rights norms that should be central to U.S. actions.

In mid-April, [the president issued a new conventional arms transfer
policy,]{.underline} giving the State Department 60 days to submit an
implementation plan. In May, [the administration also started a 45-day
public comment period on **regulatory changes that would transfer the
control of assault rifles and other weapons of choice in armed violence
to the Commerce Department.**]{.underline}

If the administration is serious about claims that these changes make
for responsible policy, it should add much greater transparency into the
arms transfer and monitoring process. Congress, if it does not act to
stop these new approaches, should make sure, at a minimum, that it
maintains meaningful oversight to prevent abuses that undermine
longstanding U.S. foreign policy objectives designed to avoid fueling
conflicts around the world and propping up regimes that do not respect
the basic human rights of their people.

Background

On April 19, Donald [Trump issued a national security presidential
memorandum replacing a January 2014 presidential policy directive
that,]{.underline} like the 1995 iteration from the Clinton
administration, [included an unweighted list of criteria to guide
decisions on U.S. conventional arms transfers.]{.underline}

Common to these policies are goals to improve the security of the United
States and its allies, prevent proliferation, and support relevant
multilateral agreements. [With the backing of major arms producers, the
Trump approach explicitly adds "economic security" as a factor in
considering whether to approve arms exports]{.underline}. It promises
that "the executive branch will advocate strongly" on behalf of U.S.
companies and "maximize the ability" of U.S. industry "to grow and
support allies and partners."

The memorandum retains many of the same provisions regarding human
rights as the Obama-era conventional arms transfer policy, although
consolidating their reference to a single section rather than
reiterating them throughout. The new policy, however, does not
explicitly say that past records on human rights will be a factor in
decisions. It does contain a new commitment to "facilitate" ally and
partner efforts "to reduce the risk of national or coalition operations
causing civilian harm."

Whether the implementation plan due soon from the Secretary of State
explains how this will be done remains to be seen, but it is expected
that training of forces will be touted as a critical component. Such
training was written into arms sales last year to Saudi Arabia and
Nigeria.

Proposed changes to the regulation of exports were announced May 14 and
published in the Federal Register May 24, beginning a public comment
period that ends in July.

Specifically, [the rules relate to the first three categories of
the]{.underline} United States Munitions List ([USML]{.underline})
maintained under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR),
whose lead administrator is the Department of State. Under the proposal,
[many items would move from the USML to the]{.underline} Commerce
Control List ([CCL) to become part of the Export Administration
Regulations (EAR), whose lead administrator is the Commerce
Department]{.underline}. Most notably, non-automatic and semi-automatic
firearms and their ammunition currently controlled under USML category I
would move to new EAR 500-series classifications in the CCL.

The primary rationale given for the change is that these weapons no
longer merit tight control. According to the State Department:

[The Department of State is engaged in an effort to **revise the U.S.
Munitions List** so that its scope is limited to those defense articles
that provide the United States with a critical military or intelligence
advantage]{.underline} or, in the case of weapons, are inherently for
military end use. [The articles now controlled by USML Categories I, II,
and III that would be removed from the USML under this proposed rule do
not meet this standard]{.underline}, including many items which are
widely available in retail outlets in the United States and abroad.

The revisions were drafted during the previous administration's export
reform control initiative, which sought to build higher fences on fewer
items. During Obama's presidency, action was taken on 18 of the USML's
21 categories, but frequent mass shootings and an administration more
supportive of gun control efforts contributed to the firearms categories
going unpublished.

Critics of President Trump, such as Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.), have
pointed to the domestic U.S. gun lobby as the real driver behind these
changes and called the decision to move forward "politically tone deaf
as our nation reckons with a gun violence epidemic."

Adding in Transparency and Enabling Assessment

As the Trump administration works to implement these changes, it should
build in transparency and process changes that make it possible to
assess whether U.S. arms exports are meeting the stated goals of the new
policies.

This would not only be good public policy, but such an approach has the
potential to address rising congressional and international distress
about an administration that has shown less restraint, including by
moving ahead with arms sales to Bahrain, Nigeria, and Saudi Arabia that
the previous administration had held back on due to serious human rights
concerns.

As a start, a public accounting and evaluation of training that might go
along with arms sales is desperately needed, especially if it will be a
cornerstone of an effort to protect civilians. With another round of
controversial precision-guided munition sales expected soon to Saudi
Arabia (as well as the UAE), it is imperative that much more is shared
about how training is done, who receives it, and whether it works.

As the Saudi-led coalition continues to hit civilian areas and an
invasion of the port of Hodeida looms that threatens to further
exacerbate the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, it is not enough to simply
say training is important. It must make a difference.

Similarly, much greater transparency into the arms sales process at a
public level is critical. [Under **current procedure** Congress is
notified of potential major arms sales whether through the foreign
military sales (**FMS**) process or via direct commercial sales
(**DCS**), starting a review period by which it could block agreement to
the sale.]{.underline}

Unlike FMS notifications, DCS notifications are not posted on a publicly
accessible website, giving the American people less time to inform their
representatives of any concerns. If the administration wants to make it
easier for companies to negotiate their arms sales, it should also
improve transparency into them.

While Congress can block or amend an arms sale up until a weapon is
delivered, those deliveries often occur years after notification. There
is typically much less public attention on arms sales during this
period. If the administration wants to speed the time between agreement
and delivery, it should agree to also make clear when a delivery is
imminent, so as to create predictable moments for oversight. In 2014,
Congress created a mechanism for receiving notification at least 30 days
before delivery when requested on select sales, but has only used the
authority once. The administration should instead make this standard on
all sales and make it public.

Public reporting afterward, via the State Department's so-called 655
report, also now has less detail than in the past. These reports, as
well as others on end-use monitoring, should provide information on the
number of specific weapons involved and other data, rather than broad
categorical details. Importantly, reports from the Commerce Department
should also improve in detail, especially if the changes on firearm
exports are put into place that transfer oversight away from the State
Department.

Without these specifics, it becomes more difficult not only to assess
these policy changes, but to further goals such as combating illicit
trafficking and weapons flows to terrorists and other unintended users.

A recent report from the Center for Civilians in Conflict and Stimson
Center offers an array of good suggestions that run the life of a
weapon---from pre-transfer to end-use monitoring---with "trigger"
mechanisms along the way that allow for reassessment as situations
change. Those recommendations, primarily focused on protecting civilians
but also relevant to promoting human rights and international law,
deserve strong consideration.

The Value of Congressional Oversight

In 2002 Congress amended its notification threshold so that it would be
informed of potential commercial sales of firearms under USML category I
when they were valued at just \$1 million, as opposed to \$14 million
for other major weapons sales.

During a Sept. 26 Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing,
then-ranking member Benjamin Cardin (D-Md.) pointed to forestalling
small arms sales to Turkey and the Philippines as recent examples of
Congress' needed role. In 2017, the administration notified Congress of
more than \$660 million of proposed firearms sales regulated under the
USML, according to the Security Assistance Monitor.

**[No similar statutory requirement of congressional notification exists
for most arms sales under the CCL, meaning Congress would lose its
oversight role on these weapons]{.underline}**. It could take steps to
require that notification continues. In response to the new measures,
Cardin said May 15

For years, I advised both the Obama and Trump Administrations against
this type of transfer. Weakened Congressional oversight of international
small arms and munitions sales is extremely hazardous to global
security. Small arms and light weapons are among the most lethal weapons
that we and other countries export because these are the weapons that
are most likely to be used to commit atrocities and suppress human
rights, either by individuals, non-state groups, or governmental
security and para-military forces.

While Congress does not have control over the president's conventional
arms transfer policy, it can mandate the types of transparency
recommended above, including an expansion on pre-delivery notifications.
It could also pass legislation that retains the classification of
firearms as military weapons and placement on the USML.

The Administration's Faulty "Economic Security" Excuse

According to the latest report from the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute (SIPRI), the United States remains the leading and
expanding provider of major conventional weapons into a growing
international arms market. Russia, long the number two arms exporter, is
in decline as Washington accounts for more than one-third of all major
weapons deliveries.

It begs credulity to argue that the United States needs a special push
in order to compete in the international arms market. Linkages of U.S.
jobs to international arms sales are also overblown as arms deals
frequently come with co-production agreements or other incentives that
support jobs abroad rather than at home.

At a more fundamental level, U.S. arms are not like any other commodity
and should not be treated as such. These are first and foremost killing
machines. The over-emphasis on economic security threatens to jeopardize
higher priorities, including peace and security concerns. If more
weapons flow to countries with poor human rights records, norms around
responsible weapons use and transfer will be harder to build and uphold.

Regarding firearms, these weapons are controlled because a significant
amount of violence that occurs, including against U.S. military and law
enforcement personnel, is inflicted by small arms. Research indicates
that the types of weapons being transferred to Commerce control---AR-15s
and AK-47 style assault rifles and their ammunition---are "weapons of
choice" of drug trafficking organizations in Mexico and other Latin
American countries. Many can also be easily converted to fully automatic
weapons, which will remain under USML control. U.S. military members
often operate their fully-automatic-capable weapons in a semi-automatic
or less-than-automatic mode.

[The transfer of firearms export control to the Department of Commerce
will also likely **remove a number of brokering registration
requirements**, may open up **license exemptions** that facilitate
weapons ending up in the wrong hands, and limit legal or investigative
actions to stop such results.]{.underline}

regulatory nuance. But the other day, we found big news, a real scoop.
[The ITAR will be rewritten to remove guns and ammunition from its
control.]{.underline} Yes, you read that correctly, [a plan has been
proposed within the State Department to migrate the first three
categories of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) to
the control of the Export Administration Regulations within the coming
year]{.underline}. Whether the State Department will go so far as to
rename ITAR Part 121 the United States Munitions List (USML), the
"United States List" remains to be seen. The Proposed Changes The
proposed amendment to the ITAR appeared in notes on the Defense Trade
Advisory Group (DTAG) meeting on Friday, September 8. For those of us
who don't live and breathe the ITAR, DTAG is the State Department's
working group that provides the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs
with a formal channel to consult the private sector on all things
concerning munitions exports. According to those notes, [USML Categories
I, II, and III are expected to move from the USML to the EAR's Commerce
Control List (CCL)]{.underline} in 2018. Those categories are as
follows: [Category I -- Firearms, Close Assault Weapons and Combat
Shotguns; Category II -- Guns and Armament; and Category III --
Ammunition/Ordnance]{.underline} Who will benefit from the reform? [U.S.
gun and ammunition manufacturers will have an increased capacity to

reduced regulatory burden[, firearm, ammunition, and ordinance
manufacturers would likely not have to register as ITAR manufacturers or
exporters]{.underline}. That registration [requires yearly renewal and
the]{.underline} base [cost]{.underline} of registration [is more than
two thousand dollars. Thereafter, those exporters would not need to
apply for the more difficult to obtain ITAR export licenses in order to
sell their products for foreign countries.]{.underline}

[The Trump Administration's proposed rule to move oversight of some
firearms exports from the State to Commerce Department removes several
key controls that were created to help prevent the misuse or diversion
of U.S. firearms. This includes the loss of key congressional
oversight.]{.underline} In the mid-1990s, Congress recognized the
significant military role that firearms could play in igniting and
fueling armed conflict in Africa and beyond and in harming U.S. national
interests. As a result, they began requiring the administration to
notify it of proposed firearms sales of \$1 million or more. However,
the proposed rule would remove this notification process completely. [In
the past two years, Congress has used this notification process to halt
or hold up firearms sales to Honduras, the Philippines, and Turkey out
of concern that U.S. firearms could be used to commit human rights
violations against civilians.]{.underline} They also stopped a
potentially risky export of assault-style firearms to the civilian
market in Mexico. The proposed rule also [prevents Congress from
understanding firearms trafficking risks by removing an administration
requirement to report on illicit firearms trafficking trends and the
diversion of U.S. weapons]{.underline}. For example, the Commerce
Department does not provide reports on their end-use activities like the
State Department does.ß

#### Trump's making it easier to sell stuff by moving it off USML---small, arms, drones, and general weapons

Stone and Spetelnick 2018 (Jan 8 2018, Mike Stone is a reporter with
Rueters, Matt Spetelnick is a reporter with Rueters, "Trump to open the
floodgates on selling US-made weapons to previously restricted buyers",
https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-to-open-the-floodgates-on-selling-us-made-weapons-2018-1)

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - [The Trump administration is nearing completion
of a new \"Buy American\" plan that calls for U.S. military attaches and
diplomats to help drum up billions of dollars more in business overseas
for the American weapons industry]{.underline}, going beyond the
assistance they currently provide, U.S. officials said. President Donald
[Trump as early as February is expected to announce a \"whole of
government\" effort to ease export rules on purchases by foreign
countries of U.S.-made military equipment, from fighter jets and drones
to warships and artillery, according to people familiar with the
plan]{.underline}. Trump is seeking to fulfill a 2016 election campaign
promise to create jobs in the United States by selling more goods and
services abroad to bring down the U.S. trade deficit from a six-year
high of \$50 billion. The administration is also under pressure from
U.S. defense contractors facing growing competition from foreign rivals
such as China and Russia. But any loosening of the restrictions on
weapons sales would be in defiance of human rights and arms control
advocates who said there was too great a risk of fueling violence in
regions such as the Middle East and South Asia or arms being diverted to
be used in terrorist attacks. [Besides greater use of a network of
military and commercial attaches already stationed at U.S. embassies in
foreign capitals, senior officials who spoke on condition of anonymity
said another thrust of the plan will be to set in motion a realignment
of the International Trafficking in Arms Regulations]{.underline}
(ITAR). It is a central policy governing arms exports since 1976 and has
not been fully revamped in more than three decades. [This expanded
government effort on behalf of American arms makers, together with
looser restrictions on weapons exports and more favorable treatment of
sales to non-NATO allies and partners, could bring additional **billions
of dollars in deals** and more job]{.underline}s, a senior U.S. official
said, without providing specifics. The strategy of having the Pentagon
and the U.S. State Department take a more active role in securing
foreign arms deals could especially benefit major defense contractors
such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing Co. \"We want to see those guys, the
commercial and military attaches, unfettered to be salesmen for this
stuff, to be promoters,\" said the senior administration official, who
is close to the internal deliberations and spoke on condition of
anonymity. A State Department official, asked to confirm details of the
coming new policy, said the revamped approach \"gives our partners a
greater capacity to help share the burden of international security,
benefits the defense industrial base and will provide more good jobs for
American workers.\" The White House and Pentagon declined official
comment. [Defense industry officials and lobbyists have privately
welcomed what they expect will be a more sales-friendly approach. It is
unclear how deeply the diplomats and military officers overseas will
delve into dealmaking and what guidelines will be established, said
officials in the administration]{.underline}. Trump, a Republican, has
the legal authority to direct government embassy \"security assistance
officers,\" both military personnel and civilians, to do more to help
drive arms sales. Administration officials see this group, which already
has duties such as managing military aid overseas and providing
information to foreign governments for buying U.S. arms, as
underutilized by previous presidents. [national security analyst said
that easing export restrictions to allow defense contractors to reap
greater profits internationally would increase the danger of
top-of-the-line U.S. weapons going to governments with poor human rights
records or being used by militants]{.underline}. \"This administration
has demonstrated from the very beginning that human rights have taken a
back seat to economic concerns,\" said Rachel Stohl, director of the
conventional defense program at the Stimson Center in Washington. \"And
the short-sightedness of a new arms export policy could have serious
long-term implications.\" The administration officials said human rights
considerations would remain part of the formula for arms sales
decisions. But they said such reviews would now afford greater weight
than before to whether a deal would be good for the U.S. economy and
strengthen America\'s defense industrial base, in which case red tape
would be cut accordingly. [Rules to make it easier to sell U.S.-made
military drones overseas and compete against fast-growing Chinese and
Israeli rivals are also expected to be in the Trump plan, officials
said]{.underline}. Trump\'s Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, also
sought to make it easier to sell to America\'s most trusted allies but
in a more cautious approach that his administration billed as a way to
boost American business while keeping strict controls against more
dangerous arms proliferation. Foreign weapons sales soared during his
tenure, with the United States retaining its position as the world\'s
top arms supplier. Shares of the five biggest U.S. defense contractors,
including Lockheed, Boeing, Raytheon Co, General Dynamics Corp and
Northrop Grumman have more than tripled over the last five years and
currently trade at or near all-time highs. c-5 galaxy m1 abrams US Air
Force Foreign military sales in fiscal 2017, comprising much of Trump\'s
first year in office and the final months of Obama\'s term, climbed to
\$42 billion, compared to \$31 billion in the prior year, according to
the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency. The Trump administration
has already moved forward on several controversial sales. Those include
a push for \$7 billion in precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia
despite concerns they have contributed to civilian deaths in the Saudi
campaign in Yemen\'s civil war and the unblocking of \$3 billion in arms
to Bahrain, which was also held up by human rights concerns under Obama.

### 2NC -- Circumvention -- Parts 

#### Loopholes let companies circumvent -- they'll sell unregulated parts or assemble in another country.

**Oxfam 10**, 5-10-2010, \"Control Arms Campaign: New report shows major
loopholes in arms export regulations,\" Oxfam Canada,
https://www.oxfam.ca/news/new-report-control-arms-campaign/

[Two major loopholes]{.underline} allow companies [to legally circumvent
arms regulations, including embargoes]{.underline}: 1. [You can't sell
it whole, but you can sell it in individual pieces]{.underline} The
European Union has an arms embargo against China; the United States and
Canada refuse to sell attack helicopters to China. Yet China's new Z-10
attack helicopter would not fly without weapons parts and technology
from a UK/Italian company (AugustaWestland), a Canadian company (Pratt &
Whitney Canada), a US company (Lord Corporation) and a Franco-German
company (Eurocopter). 2[. You can't sell from here, but you can sell
from over there]{.underline} Canada has [not authorized the export of
combat aircraft to Colombia]{.underline}, where there are reports of
aerial bombings of civilians as recent as 2004. [Yet the Colombian Air
Force is now acquiring Super Tucano aircraft]{.underline} from the
Brazilian company Embraer, [which are armed with two machine guns and
are powered by engines]{.underline} [from Pratt & Whitney]{.underline}
Canada. China's [Z-10 helicopter]{.underline} ([made from]{.underline}
Canadian turboshaft engines and other EU and [US parts]{.underline})
[has been sold to a number of countries, including Sudan, which is under
a full]{.underline} EU [arms embargo]{.underline} and a partial UN arms
embargo. There have been documented cases of helicopters killing
civilians in Sudan's protracted conflicts, though it is not known
whether these specific helicopters were used. In May 2005, Uzbek
security forces fired on demonstrators, killing hundreds of people. They
used [military Land Rovers]{.underline} during the massacre, which were
made of 70 per cent British parts. The Land Rover parts were sent \"flat
pack\" to Turkey, where [they were assembled and made into military
vehicles, then supplied to the Uzbek government]{.underline}. The UK has
no control over the deal because the vehicles were not assembled and
converted into military vehicles in the UK. \"EU [arms makers don't have
to sacrifice profits for the sake of principle, instead they can simply
subcontract]{.underline},\" said Rebecca Peters, Director of the
International Action Network on Small Arms. \"For example, the Austrian
gun company Glock is trying to establish a production plant in Brazil.
If that goes ahead, Glock will be able to circumvent the EU Code of
Conduct on Arms Exports by shipping guns from its Brazilian plant.\" The
report also shows [that the technology revolutionizing the arms industry
is often the same as that used in the home, and that it is frequently
unregulated. For example, the digital signal processors used in the
latest DVD players can also be found in target acquisition systems for
fighter jet missile systems. This technology is not regulated even when
it is sold for use in military planes]{.underline}. \"Arms trade laws
are so out of date that [the sales of army helmets are more regulated
than the components assembled into deadly weapons]{.underline}. What the
world needs is an effective international Arms Trade Treaty that will
stop the flow of arms to those that commit human rights abuses,\" said
Irene Khan, Director General of Amnesty International.

#### We'll just help other countries build them instead of selling directly.

deal, high-tech U.S. bombs to be built in Saudi Arabia",
https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/under-trump-arms-deal-high-tech-u-s-bombs-be-n1015346)

WASHINGTON --- [A controversial arms deal for Arab allies approved by
the Trump administration will allow U.S. hi-tech bomb parts to be
**manufactured in Saudi Arabia**, giving Riyadh unprecedented access to
a sensitive weapons technology]{.underline}. The production arrangement
is part of a larger \$8.1 billion arms package for Saudi Arabia, the
United Arab Emirates and Jordan announced two weeks ago. The Trump
administration pressed ahead with the sale without congressional
approval, declaring an \"emergency\" based on what it said was a
heightened threat from Iran. [The deal came as a surprise to lawmakers,
who were outraged that the administration chose to **bypass
Congress**]{.underline}. But most members of Congress only learned days
after the deal was announced May 24 that it opens the door for Saudi
Arabia to host the production of electronic guidance and control systems
for Paveway precision-guided bombs, congressional aides said. The New
York Times first reported on the co-production arrangement. Lawmakers
are expected to grill a senior State Department official --- R. Clarke
Cooper, assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs ---
about the arms deal and the bomb production plan at a House Foreign
Affairs Committee hearing Wednesday. [The U.S. government tends to
closely guard technology linked to sophisticated weapons, and limits how
much of that technology is shared through co-production projects with
other countries. Lawmakers opposed to the deal said the production
scheme sent the wrong signal to Saudi Arabia given its human rights
record and its air war in Yemen, raised security concerns about sharing
so-called \"smart bomb\" technology with Riyadh and undercut one of
President Donald Trump\'s arguments for selling weapons to the Saudis
--- to generate jobs in the United States]{.underline}. \"The concerns
over this sale are only one more reason showing the importance of
congressional review and why it is deeply disturbing that the Trump
administration is trying to circumvent the law and Congress to give the
Saudis not only American jobs but also American weapons technology,\"
Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the ranking Democrat on the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, said. The co-production plan had raised
eyebrows among some lawmakers more than a year ago when the
administration first tried to secure approval for tens of thousands of
precision-guided bombs to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, a
Democratic congressional aide told NBC News. Menendez held up the sale
of 120,000 precision-guided bombs for Saudi Arabia and the UAE last year
because of numerous accounts of civilian casualties from Saudi-led air
raids in Yemen. The senator has said the administration failed to
persuade him that selling more of the so-called \"smart\" bombs would
prevent more civilian deaths. Human rights, U.N. investigators and aid
groups have accused Saudi Arabia and its allies of striking civilian
targets, including hospitals and schools, in indiscriminate bombing
raids in Yemen since Riyadh launched an armed intervention against
Houthi rebels in 2015. Congressional resistance to weapons sales to
Saudi Arabia only grew after the killing last year of Saudi writer and
Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in
Istanbul. The [Trump administration has defended the arms sale as a way
of ensuring Arab allies can defend themselves amid an allegedly
increased danger from Iran, and that Washington\'s credibility as a
military partner was at risk if it did not deliver spare parts and other
weapons promptly. U.S. officials privately have also said that
maintaining arms sales helps Washington exert a constructive influence
over the kingdom]{.underline}. A State Department official, who was not
authorized to speak on the record, said the production arrangement \"is
not something we would have licensed if we were not fully confident in
both the Saudi ability to protect the technology, as well as the
positive impact on the American defense industrial base.\" Democratic
Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, an outspoken critic of U.S. support
for the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen, condemned the production
arrangement. \"To think that we would co-produce these bombs and in turn
contribute to an arms race, regional instability, and civilian deaths is
unfathomable,\" Murphy said. \"Congress needs to put a stop to the way
we do business with the Saudis and start acting like the senior partner
in this relationship rather than succumbing to whatever the kingdom
wants.\" \"A secretive monarchy that commits atrocities in Yemen, that
murders dissidents and journalists and lies to the world about it, and
that treats women as property is not one to which we should be giving
some of our most sensitive military technology,\" Sen. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., said. The Paveway bombs can strike a target within 10 feet when
fired from 40,000 feet, according to William Hartung, director of the
Arms and Security Project at the Washington-based Center for
International Policy, and will almost certainly be used in the war in
Yemen. \"The weapons are going to be put to use in a civilian
slaughter,\" he said. Displays of missiles stand at the Raytheon

### 2NC -- Circumvention -- Transfers 

#### **Bunch of loopholes keep transfers going -- gifts, loans, leases, and aid**

**Jain 18** \[Sangeet Jain, MA in IR from Jawaharlal Nehru University,
"Why India's Position on the Arms Trade Treaty Endures", Small Wars

https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/why-indias-position-arms-trade-treaty-endures\]

The treaty also contains some **[gaping loopholes]{.underline}** which
[**leaves options open for arms transfers** such as "gifts, loans,
leases and aid ".]{.underline} [Under any of these labels, **exporting
states could arm political allies which would otherwise be
barred**]{.underline} under the treaty. [This loophole]{.underline}, in
this author's opinion, [nullifies the whole rationale]{.underline} for
the treaty itself. [The treaty]{.underline} is also clearly not in tune
with the times as it [fails to cover technology transfer -- an
increasingly crucial component of arms deals today.]{.underline}
According to Max Mutschler of the Bonn International Center for
Conversion (Dorrie Peter, 2015), arms deals come with intellectual
property which allows recipients to produce arms locally as well.
Mutschler also argues that the [reporting requirements have
**fundamental lacunae** such as the exclusion of ammunition and weapons
parts and components.]{.underline}

[The five principle (legal) means by which America exports weapons and
military services abroad are foreign military sales (FMS), direct
commercial sales (DCS), leases of equipment, transfers of excess defense
articles (EDA) and emergency drawdowns of weaponry.]{.underline} [To get
the most accurate picture possible of US weapons exports]{.underline} in
a given year-to the whole world or to a particular destination-[you must
compile transfers made through all of these channels.]{.underline} Most
arms deals begin with contact between a foreign government and a US
security assistance organization (SAO)-US military personnel located in
diplomatic posts and embassies abroad. SAOs help foreign militaries
define their needs, provide them with data on American military
equipment and function as the primary in-country point of contact for US
weapons contractors. These offices produce annual military assistance
assessments, which form the basis of the upcoming year\'s military aid
and arms sales programs. [SAO personnel determine which form of transfer
best suits the recipient-sale, joint production of the weapon, lease or
grant transfer]{.underline}.

#### Multiple alternatives to sales guarantee circumvention:

#### Lease To Own

American Scientists for 9 years.

[**Lease to Own** The end of the cold war left the United States
with]{.underline}-literally-[a surplus]{.underline} army (and navy and
air force) [of weapons]{.underline}. While [the Pentagon]{.underline}
usually sells excess arms to foreign governments (through FMS) or gives
them away (see below), in recent years it has [loaned large quantities
of equipment to foreign militaries. The Arms Export Control Act
authorizes the Pentagon to lend weapons out]{.underline}, as long as the
Defense Department guarantees that the articles are not required for use
by U.S. military or civilian agencies for the duration of the lease.
Typical reasons for leasing are [to provide a weapon for testing
purposes; to allow the Pentagon to respond to an \"urgent\" foreign
requirement while still retaining ownership of the equipment as a hedge
against possible future needs; or to provide equipment on the cheap when
the recipient cannot afford to purchase the weapons outright. The
customer pays a rental charge which equals the depreciation of the
equipment during the lease]{.underline}. G[overnment-negotiated leases
are sealed with a contract (called an LOA]{.underline}), the same as
government-negotiated sales. The LOA covers costs incurred in upgrading
or conditioning the equipment, delivery, training and restoration or
replacement if the weapon is damaged. L[eases]{.underline} run for a
fixed period, capped at five years, but they [can be
renewed.]{.underline} The US government maintains title for the leased
weaponry, and the Defense Department may terminate a lease and require
the immediate return of the equipment at any time. The Pentagon must
notify Congress of any weapons lease that will run for more than a year,
as well as any lease surpassing the \$14 million threshold established
for notification of FMS and DCS. [The widespread use of leasing also
leads to undercounting U.S. arms exports, since dollar-based
determinations of the arms trade count only the rent, as opposed to the
value of the weapon being transferred. In recent years, the value of
weaponry being leased to countries around the world has doubled-from
\$300 million in 1994 to nearly \$700 million in 1996. Since most leases
run for several years, it is reasonable to assume that the United States
currently has well over one billion dollars worth of lethal equipment on
loan to foreign militaries.]{.underline}

#### Excess Defense Articles

Lora **Lumpe and** Jeff **Donarski**, 19**98**, \"The Arms Trade
Revealed: A Guide for Investigators and Activists,\" Federation of
American Scientists,

assistance is more transparent and effective, and does not undermine
human rights and governance. Jeff Donarski has notable professional
experience on defense issues. Donarski worked fro the Federation of
American Scientists for 9 years.

The Pentagon has been running a giant garage sale throughout the 1990s
to unload its large overstock of dated, but still lethal, weapons and
spare parts. [Not wanting to pay the costs of storing or destroying the
surplus, the Department of Defense dispenses most of it for free or at
deep reduction through the excess defense articles (EDA) program. The
Foreign Assistance Act defines EDA as surplus equipment owned by the US
government, but not originally procured for anticipated sale or
assistance programs.]{.underline} Militaries interested in obtaining
free EDA must go through a process similar to that for purchasing new
weapons under the FMS program. Through the US embassy\'s security
assistance office, the foreign government or organization submits a
letter of request to the Pentagon. The application is referred to the
Army, Navy, Air Force or Defense Logistics Agency, depending on the type
of equipment desired, and the services\' sales offices determine if EDA
will satisfy the request. By law, the Department of Defense must avoid
undercutting U.S. arms companies seeking to sell newly- manufactured
equipment. If transfers of surplus weapons are deemed appropriate, the
DSAA must give Congress 30 days to consider the export of major items
before going forward. Gifts or sales of surplus ships are treated
differently; for naval vessels less than 20 years old, Congress must
pass a law (usually drafted by the Navy) approving the export sale or
grant. [These laws usually pass without controversy. Since 1990, the
Pentagon has offered approximately \$8 billion of excess military
equipment to foreign militaries, including nearly 4,000 heavy tanks,
over 500 bombers and more than 300,000 pistols, rifles and machine guns.
Free shipments of surplus arms are regularly omitted from official
statistics on the overall value of U.S. arms exports. Even when surplus
arms are included, the value ascribed to them is often heavily
discounted, thereby further undercounting total levels of US arms
transfers.]{.underline} One government investigation found that EDA sold
through the FMS program are routinely priced at 5-50 percent of their
original acquisition cost. [In 1996 the executive branch authorized over
\$525.8 million of grant EDA transfers]{.underline}. Due to a law passed
by Congress during the same year, beginning in 1997 the government will
be limited to giving away no more than \$350 million of surplus arms
annually. This cap is counted in terms of the current value ascribed to
the equipment, which-as stated-is often unrealistically low. Originally,
only the poorer members of the NATO alliance were cleared to receive
EDA, but following the 1991 Gulf war, many [Middle Eastern and North
African states]{.underline} were added; the \"Partnership for Peace\"
program made [most Central and Eastern European governments eligible for
free surplus arms; and South American and Caribbean]{.underline}
countries were authorized for free weaponry as part of counter-narcotics
efforts. [Among the leading recipients]{.underline} of free weapons
through this program in 1996 [were Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Egypt,
Israel, Jordan, Bahrain and Turkey-all countries where serious political
repression and/or human rights violations were reported]{.underline}.

#### Loan and grants

Lora **Lumpe and** Jeff **Donarski**, 19**98**, \"The Arms Trade
Revealed: A Guide for Investigators and Activists,\" Federation of

[There are several ways to finance arms deals,]{.underline} including
direct grants or loans through the foreign military financing (FMF)
program, [fungible cash transfers through the economic support fund
(ESF), grant aid for international military education and training
(IMET)]{.underline} and assistance related to the war on drugs. If these
aid programs fall short, [customers can use commercial loan guarantee
programs and/or barter.]{.underline} Foreign military financing refers
to congressionally appropriated funds (in the form of grants and loans),
given to foreign governments to finance the purchase of American-made
weapons, services and training through either FMS or DCS. Since 1950,
the US government has provided over \$91 billion in FMF to militaries
around the world. During the cold war, this aid was directed toward
three principal goals: building up the militaries of the poorer members
of the NATO alliance, countering Soviet military influence in the
developing world and rewarding Israel and Egypt for making a cold peace
in 1979. [The majority of FMF is in the form of outright
grants,]{.underline} which in 1998 will total \$3.2 billion. This
military assistance primarily benefits Israel and Egypt, which receive
\$1.8 and \$1.3 billion, respectively, in FMF annually as a reward for
their peace effort at Camp David almost twenty years ago. [Since 1980,
successive American administrations have given Israel nearly \$28
billion and Egypt over \$19 billion in grant FMF to purchase US-made
weaponry]{.underline}. (Israel is allowed to spend \$475 million of its
annual allotment to purchase weaponry made by its own industry.) Jordan
has recently been added to the regular recipient list, also in return
for making peace with Israel. In addition to grant FMF, [Congress
appropriates money to the Pentagon to underwrite loans to foreign
militaries for the purchase of American arms]{.underline}. Until the
early 1980s, almost all FMF was provided in the form of loans, rather
than grants. But many U.S. allies became mired in military debt, so the
Reagan administration shifted to providing the bulk of FMF in grants. In
addition[, many of the previously made \"loans\" were effectively
converted to grants, to reward key allies and ease their debt
burden.]{.underline} In 1990, for example, the US government \"forgave\"
more than \$7 billion in weapons loans owed by Egypt (in the lead up to
the Gulf war). Several years later, the Clinton administration zeroed
out \$400 million of Jordan\'s military debt. In other cases, the
Pentagon has written off loans when the recipient country broke down
into total warfare and chaos (as in Liberia and Somalia). As of October
1997, the Pentagon had \$13.2 billion of loans outstanding, with several
countries nearly \$900 million in arrears. Throughout the 1990s, Greece
and Turkey have been the principal recipients of new FMF loans for arms.
In 1998, though, the administration ended the FMF program for these two
countries. In their place, with the development of NATO\'s \"Partnership
for Peace\" and the planned expansion of the alliance, former Warsaw
Pact and Soviet states are now receiving both security grants and loans
for weapons purchases and military training. Financing Foreign
Militaries In November 1997, Congress passed into law the foreign aid
appropriations act for fiscal year 1998 (H.R.2159). The law appropriated
\$3.2 billion in grant military aid and \$60 million to underwrite \$657
million of military loans. Congress directed the money to be allocated
as follows: Source: H.R.2159 Egypt \$1,300,000,000 Israel
\$1,800,000,000 Jordan \$75,000,000 Baltics \$18,300,000 Poland, Hungary
and Czech Republic \$50,000,000 Greece (loan) \$105,000,000 Turkey
(loan) \$150,000,000 administrative costs \$23,250,000 Researching FMF
The annual foreign aid appropriations act, passed by Congress, sets the
overall level of FMF and \"earmarks\" certain amounts for certain
countries (principally Egypt, Israel, Greece and Turkey). This
legislation is easy to obtain, either in electronic form via the
Internet (search for it at thomas.loc.gov or at
www.house.gov/appropriations) or in published version from the House
documents room. To research past or cumulative FMF levels to a
particular country, region or the whole world, consult Foreign Military
Sales Facts. The most recently-published volume covers each of the ten
preceding years. Prior volumes can be used to research earlier time
spans. In addition, the Congressional Presentation for Foreign
Operations (prepared annually by the State Department for Congress, with
a limited quantity available to the public) includes a detailed
description of, and justification for, the administration\'s FMF request
for the coming fiscal year. This document provides the basis for
Congress\' foreign aid funding bills. It also shows dollar amounts of
military aid actually allocated in the preceding couple of years.
Section 25(a) of the Arms Export Control Act requires the Pentagon to
submit to Congress an annual report on outstanding weapons loans. You
can request this report, as well as other specific information, from the
Defense Department under the Freedom of Information Act. Cash Transfers
[Congress established the economic support fund (ESF]{.underline}) to
promote economic and political stability in strategically important
regions where the United States has special security interests. The
[funds are provided on a grant basis]{.underline} and are available for
a variety of economic purposes, like infrastructure and development
projects. Historically, these are untargeted cash transfers, not
designated for any particular purpose. [Although not intended for
military expenditure, money is fungible, and these grants allow the
recipient government to free up its own money for military
programs]{.underline}. Moreover, [ESF grants to Israel-at \$1.2 billion
annually-are explicitly provided to allow repayment of Israel\'s
military debt to the United States]{.underline}. And Egypt\'s annual
dole of \$815 million is tied to Israel\'s aid, again because of the
Camp David peace agreement. [Other leading recipients of
ESF]{.underline}-although paling in comparison to Egypt and Israel\'s
haul-[have been Cambodia, Haiti, Palestine and Turkey]{.underline}.
[Congress appropriated \$2.4 billion in ESF for 1998,]{.underline}
roughly the same amount as in the preceding couple of years.

### 2NC -- Circumvention -- Vagueness 

#### [Vagueness]{.underline} enables [presidential expansion]{.underline} -- [partisanship]{.underline} means it [can't]{.underline} be checked -- [any risk]{.underline} of circumvention means the plan provides [cover]{.underline} for [worse abuses]{.underline}

At the same time, [the executive]{.underline} branch has [gained power
from deference]{.underline} doctrines [that induce courts to
**leave**]{.underline} much **[conduct untouched]{.underline}**
---[particularly in **foreign affairs**]{.underline}.19 [The
**combination** of **deference** and the **veto** is **especially
insidious**]{.underline} ---it means that [a President can **interpret**
a **vague statute** to give himself **additional powers**]{.underline},
[receive deference in that interpretation]{.underline} from courts, [and
then lock that decision into place by brandishing the veto]{.underline}.
[This **ratchet-and-lock scheme** makes it]{.underline} almost
**[impossible]{.underline}** [to rein in executive power]{.underline}.

[**All legislative action** is therefore **dangerous**]{.underline}.
**[Any bill]{.underline}**, like Senator McCain's torture bill, can [be
**derailed** through compromise]{.underline}. [A **rational
legislator**]{.underline}, fearing this cascading cycle, [is **likely to
do nothing**]{.underline} at all.

This expansion of presidential power is reinforced by the party system.
When the political branches are controlled by the same **[party,
loyalty]{.underline}**, discipline, [and **self-interest**]{.underline}
generally [preclude interbranch checking]{.underline}. That reluctance
is exacerbated by a paucity of weapons that check the President.
Post-Chadha, [**Congress** only has **weapons** that cause extensive
**collateral damage**]{.underline}. The fear of that damage becomes yet
another reason why Congress is plagued with inertia. And the filibuster,
the last big check in periods of singleparty government, is useless
against the host of problems caused by Presidents who take expansive
views of their powers under existing laws (such as the AUMF). Instead of
preserving bicameralism, Chadha has led to its subversion and
"no-cameralism."

[A Congress that conducts **little oversight** provides]{.underline} a
**[veneer of legitimacy]{.underline}** [to an **adventurist
President**]{.underline}. [The President can **appeal** to the historic
**sense of checks and balances**]{.underline}, [even if those checks are
entirely **compromised**]{.underline} by modern political dynamics. With
this system in place, it is no surprise that recent calls for
legislative revitalization have failed. [**No successful action-forcing
mechanisms** have been **developed**]{.underline}; instead we are still
in John Hart Ely's world of giving a "halftime pep-talk imploring that
body to pull up its socks and reclaim its rightful authority."20 It is
time to consider second-best solutions to bring separation of powers
into the executive. Bureaucracy can be reformed and celebrated (instead
of purged and maligned), and neutral conflict-decision mechanisms can be
introduced. Design choices such as these can help bring our government
back in line with the principles envisioned by our Founders.21

Contrary to the received wisdom, this [experimental Article advances the

use of force might actually have a perverse effect.]{.underline} Thus,
[**rather** than create a drag effect that minimizes the impulse to rush
into imprudent wars, congressional authorization might]{.underline}
actually [do the **opposite**]{.underline}: because such [authorization
allows the President to **spread** the potential **political costs** of
military failure or stalemate to **other** elected **officials**, it
will lead the President to select into **more high risk**]{.underline}
wars than [he would otherwise choose if he were acting
unilaterally.]{.underline} In other words, [since congressional
authorization acts as a political "insurance policy" that]{.underline}
partially [**protects the President** against the possible political
**fallout** from a military misadventure, he is]{.underline} likely to
be [more **willing to engage** in wars where the expected **outcome** is
**uncertain**]{.underline}. More importantly, not only is the President
likely to use congressional authorization [as a **hedge** to
**prevent**]{.underline} future [political opponents from

also likely to use it to protect members of his party in Congress who

Subpart A described four devices that Congress can use to counter
executive action.135 This section argues that [none of those tools is an
adequate check on executive autonomy in arms export
regulation]{.underline}, and in particular on the State Department\'s
interpretation at issue here. First, [although congressional amendment
of the AECA would certainly be an effective check on the State
Department\'s incorrect interpretation of 5 129, it is neither a timely
nor reliable one]{.underline}. The process by which Article I
legislation is enacted is cumbersome and predictable The path by which a
bill becomes law is [fraught with pitfalls and hurdles]{.underline} Not
only must a bill survive the traditional obstacles associated with
lawmaking, but it must also compete with other legislation for committee
time and floor time, as well as meet with the approval of various
individuals such as committee and subcommittee chairmen and the
leadership of each house \"Theinstitutional obstacles to formal
congressional response are likely to be overcome only when the agency\'s
position has incited widespread or well-organized discontent, and most
agencies are politically adept enough to avoid taking many such
extremely provocative actions.\"\'39 Without such widespread
disapproval, many contested agency interpretations are left wanting. The
second congressional device, the \"[resolutions of disapproval\" that
Congress can issue regarding a proposed agency rule, are applicable only
to proposed \"rules.\"\'40 Informal interpretations of a statutory
provision, such as the State Department\'s current stance on the
brokering provision of the AECA, will not qualify for this sort of
congressional response]{.underline}. Furthermore, the State Department
is an executive department with a Cabinet level secretary who serves at
the behest of the president.l4l \"Thus, when the President has a firm
preference on the policy issue, that preference will often exercise a
more powerful constraint on the agency than congressional
monitoring.\"142 In other words, [even if Congress officially
disapproved of the State Department\'s interpretation, it is unlikely to
have any effect on that interpretation if the President and the
Secretary of State feel strongly about the issue]{.underline}.
Congress\'s political oversight\'43 is an \"integral part of the
on-going relationship between Congress and the agencies,\"144 but is
often restricted by the interests of committee chairmen, leadership, and
other individuals who have the power to organize widespread support. 145
[Additionally, political oversight is subject to constraints similar to
those that affect \"resolutions of disapproval.\" The State Department
is at the heart of the Executive branch and deals with issues that
heavily influence the President\'s foreign policy. Congress can have all
the hearings it wants, but at the end of the day the Office of Defense
Trade Controls answers to the Secretary of State who answers to the
resident]{.underline}.\'[\^\^ The final congressional device, budgetary
constraints, is often an effective tool Even this traditional tool,
however, has a limited effect on the current issue.]{.underline} The
State Department performs such an integral role in foreign relations and
national security that suggesting a reduction in the department\'s
budget as a threat would be met with insurmountable
disapproval-especially in the realm of weapons control. To illustrate,
President Bush\'s 2007 proposed budget asks Congress to reduce spending
in almost every area of government except those areas associated with
national security.148 [Since September 11, suggesting cuts in programs
with security implications is politically unwise. Thus Congress is
highly unlikely to propose cuts in DDTC\'s budget as punishment for
DDTC\'s inconsistent interpretation]{.underline} of 8 129.\'[\~\~ In
conclusion, the checks and balances that animate our system of
government are absent in the context of arms export regulation. Judicial
review is discouraged because of deference to the Executive and
explicitly precluded by procedural safeguards in the APA and within
DDTC. Congress\'s traditional oversight devices are also ineffective or
limited. Article I legislation is cumbersome and unpredictable.
Congress\'s \"resolution of disapproval\" is not applicable to informal
interpretations and would probably fall on deaf ears at the executively
controlled State Department if it were available.]{.underline}
Congress\'s political oversight is not an adequate solution. And
budgetary constraints are not likely to gain traction in a Congress that
dare not suggest reducing the appropriations of an office with national
security responsibilities. This set of ineffective restraints leaves the
State Department unchecked in their recent interpretation of 5 129. Such
unfettered autonomy is a sharp departure from our government\'s
fundamental principle of checks and balances.150

### 2NC -- AT: Consults Congress 

#### The exec ignores congressional consultation regulations -- no oversight 

David **Travers**, 10-19-20**07**, \"The permanent intelligence
committees of the United States congress and effective oversight of
covert operations,\" Taylor &amp; Francis,
<https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07430178708405295?journalCode=cdan19>
David Travers is a professor of Politics and International Relations at
Lancaster University.

Partly as a result of the Church and Pike Committees\' investigations,
which revealed abuses and illegalities by the intelligence community and
an almost somnolent supervision by [Congress]{.underline}, the Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence was established in 1976 and a similar
committee in the House of the Representatives in 1977. Both [were
entrusted]{.underline}, as surrogates of Congress[, with a broad mandate
of oversight]{.underline} for the intelligence community: [they were
given powers of investigation, the right to information and budgetary
authority. But doubt exists about how well they can perform oversight
over]{.underline} covert operations, defined as \"activities conducted
abroad in support of national foreign policy objectives which are
designed to further [United States programmes and policies
abroad]{.underline} and which are planned and executed so that the role
of the United States government is not apparent or acknowledged publicly
. . .,\" [when an administration increases the volume and scope of these
activities and regards the Congressional role in guarding against abuse,
waste and plain foolishness as an impediment rather than a
help]{.underline}. [This appears to have been the attitude]{.underline}
of the Reagan administration on occasions, and particularly [in relation
to]{.underline} the [secret arms sales]{.underline} to Iran, the Contras
and Nicaragua, and the civil wars in Angola. First in the case of Iran
and, to a lesser extent, Nicaragua. The administration, for political
reasons, adopted an interpretation of the 1980 Intelligence Oversight
Act --- which codified practice since 1976 and amended the 1947 National
Security Act --- that was unacceptable to Congress. [The intelligence
community is obliged to keep the two committees fully and currently
informed of all intelligence activities, including, any significant
anticipated intelligence activity which encompasses covert operations.
When the administration decides that a covert operation is required in
the national interest the President makes such a finding in
writing]{.underline}. [The Director of the CIA immediately informs the
committees before implementation. But if the President determines that
is is essential to limit prior notification of covert
operations]{.underline} to meet extraordinary circumstances affecting
the vital interests of the United States, [he can restrict notification
to]{.underline} the Chairman and the Ranking Minority members of the
Intelligence Committees, the Speaker and Minority Leader of [the
House]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} the Majority and Minority Leader
of [the Senate]{.underline}. The President would then have to report the
operation to the Committees in a timely fashion and provide a statement
of the reasons for his not having given prior notice. [In the case
of]{.underline} the [arm sales]{.underline} to [Iran the President
issued an executive order]{.underline} on 17 January 1986 [that
specifically stated that the two intelligence committees were not to be
informed]{.underline} because of the extreme sensitivity of the
operation and the security risks involved. And the Senate Intelligence
Committee\'s staff report on Iran stated that [the administration never
seriously considered]{.underline} invoking the procedure limiting
[notification to the Congressional leadership]{.underline}, decisions
that the President defended in his press conference of the 19 November
1986 on the ground that he had the legal right, under the 1980 statute,
not to inform the Congress about secret intelligence operations until he
believed that it was safe to do so.

### 2NC -- AT: Fiat 

#### He'll [claim to be in compliance]{.underline} even if it's [completely untenable]{.underline}\-\--short-circuits [all]{.underline} their "institutional respect" arguments

**Devins 17**, \[Professor of Law and Government at College of William
and Mary, The Erosion of Congressional Checks on Presidential Power,
January 29,
scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1404&context=popular_media\]

The Cipher Brief: What are the major things that a president can or
can't do today without significant legislative or judicial checks?

Neal Devins: [The President has **broad authority to interpret federal
law** in ways that advance the]{.underline} President's political
[agenda.]{.underline} Whenever the President does that, [he is claiming
to act within]{.underline} the [authority]{.underline} that [Congress
gives him.]{.underline} In other words, the President can pursue a broad
range of initiatives [where they **see space** in]{.underline} the
[existing law to **claim**]{.underline} that [they are acting
under]{.underline} the [authority of]{.underline} that
[law.]{.underline}

[This can be done through ex]{.underline}ecutive [o]{.underline}rders,
presidential [directives, regulations, etc. The **toolbox
is**]{.underline} quite **[expansive]{.underline}** in terms of the
mechanisms available to the President to be used to pursue his or her
agenda. And [all]{.underline} those things [can be done
unilaterally]{.underline} because the President's claiming that he is
acting under the authority of a laws enacted by Congress.

Obviously there are limits. For instance, Congress can authorize the
suspension of habeas corpus in military tribunals but the Supreme Court
could then say "we don't care if you're acting under the authority of
Congress, you can't suspend habeas corpus." So there are still checks to
this power.

However, the [**limits are ultimately pretty thin**.]{.underline} The
[courts **rarely slap the president down**; more significant, in this
polarized era, Congress has a **very difficult time standing up to the
President** and **resisting**]{.underline} presidential
[**unilateralism**.]{.underline}

In addition to initiatives purportedly tied to federal law, the
president has some -- though not many -- inherent powers. For instance,
executive privilege is not based on some statute or authority that comes
from Congress, that comes from presidential authority. However, these
inherent powers are quite limited; [the bulk of executive powers come
from the president's claim that she is simply interpreting or
implementing federal law, even if]{.underline} they are
[interpreting]{.underline} that law [in ways that would be **shocking
to**]{.underline} the **[people who wrote that law.]{.underline}**

**Kumar 3-19**, \[Anita Kumar serves as White House correspondent and
associate editor, covering President Donald Trump and helping organize
and guide coverage for POLITICO's White House team, Trump officials
prepared to stonewall Democratic oversight demands, 2019,
https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/19/trump-democrat-oversight-investigation-congress-1225761\]

House Judiciary Chairman Jerry [Nadler wrote to the White
House]{.underline} last month [demanding info]{.underline}rmation
[about]{.underline} President Donald Trump's declaration of a [national
emergency]{.underline} to fund the construction of a southern border
wall.

Yet [Nadler's]{.underline} Feb. 22 **[deadline]{.underline}** came and
[**went** with **no response**.]{.underline} Not only did the Democratic
congressman not receive the documents he wanted, [he didn't even receive
a]{.underline} customary [letter back]{.underline} from the White House
acknowledging his request.

It was [just one example of the Trump White House's unusually
hostile]{.underline} [--- or]{.underline} in this case, [non-existent
--- response to congressional investigators.]{.underline}

In their early response to an onslaught of Democratic requests, Trump
officials are breaking from norms set by previous administrations of
both parties, according to people who worked in the White House or
Capitol Hill during the presidencies of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and
Barack Obama.

Over the last two months, [Trump's intent has become clear: He doesn't
plan to negotiate with Congress]{.underline} over their demands for
information and witnesses the way his predecessors did. Instead, House
[Democrats are going to have to **fight** him for
**everything**.]{.underline}

POLITICO contacted the [17 House committees that unsuccessfully
requested records or witnesses]{.underline} from the Trump
administration over the last two months. [In **most cases**]{.underline}
involving the White House itself, as opposed to agencies and
departments, [the request was **ignored** altogether.]{.underline} In at
least one instance, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone responded with an
aggressive letter questioning the committee's authority to even ask for
information. (In contrast to the White House, departments and agencies
often delivered requested information politely.)

Another deadline came and went on Monday. The White House ignored
Nadler's latest request for a slew of documents about fired
administration officials, Russian nationals and Trump businesses,
according to a person familiar with the situation. The White House and
Committee declined to comment.

As a result --- despite high hopes among Democrats that they would
quickly be in possession of troves of internal Trump administration
documents, and grilling a succession of administration witnesses --- [a
**long** and **frustrating fight** with **Trump lawyers** lies ahead, a
fight that could end up in **court**. Splashy demands]{.underline} of
the White House made in the early days of the new House Democratic
majority, [could]{.underline} take many months, possibly
**[stretching]{.underline}** [well **into 2020,**]{.underline} to
produce results.

Democrats are already furious over what they call the brazen
stonewalling. But David Bossie, a Trump confidant and adviser who served
as the House GOP's lead investigator into the Clinton White House in the
1990s, predicted that [Trump officials will **face no** serious **legal
consequences** for **ignoring** the requests]{.underline} --- and said
they are justified in doing so because Democrats are waging what they
call nakedly partisan inquiries.

"The White House is taking the exact right tactic to ignore the requests
and see what comes of it," he said. "I wouldn't respect \[the
Democrats'\] process."

The White House failed to provide information about the national
emergency to the Intelligence and Judiciary committees by their January
and February deadlines, according to information obtained by POLITICO.
It didn\'t send documents about Trump's communications with Russian
President Vladimir Putin to the Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and
Oversight committees by last Friday\'s deadline. And the House Oversight
Committee did not receive information about possible breaches of the
security clearance system before its March 4 deadline. Cipollone argued
that the committee "has failed to point to any authority establishing a
legitimate legislative purpose for \[its\] unprecedented and
extraordinarily intrusive demands."

[Trump's advisers are confident that his core supporters will
**welcome** a **bare-knuckled response**]{.underline}, and hope to
persuade other voters that Democrats are overreaching in their oversight
responsibilities.

"The White House and the executive branch generally has been
stonewalling the Judiciary Committee..." Nadler told MSNBC Monday night.
"They've been doing everything they can to have witnesses say 'I won't
talk to you about conversations with the president, I won't talk to you
about this, I won't talk to you about that,' without asserting executive
privilege. And they have no right to do that."

The [Trump]{.underline} administration, however, [has]{.underline} some
[**structural advantages** in its fight]{.underline} with House
Democrats.

[Congress's **leverage** to get info]{.underline}rmation has
**[diminished]{.underline}** over time [because of **staff cutbacks,**
previous **partisan overreach**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} Capitol
Hill **[dysfunction]{.underline}** that is [preventing them from forcing
the White House to turn over records. And the House has less recourse
against an uncooperative White House because]{.underline}, unlike the
Senate, [it can't hold up administration nominees.]{.underline}

[It has]{.underline} now [been 21 days]{.underline} and counting

extrajudicial killing, or other gross human rights violations committed
against victims who sought to expose corruption or other illegality by
foreign government officials or in the exercise of the freedoms of
expression, religion or other internationally recognized human rights.
It also requires a report on whether the person in the request has been
sanctioned, or whether the President intends to impose sanctions. [The
statute is clear]{.underline} on its face: "[The President shall" make

### 2AC -- Compliance -- Courts 

#### Violations would be [litigated]{.underline}\-\--he would comply 

**Date 18**, \[Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost, Trump's
Claims Of Vast Power Could Be Heading Toward A Supreme Court Showdown,
[June 5th]{.underline},
https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-power-supreme-court-showdown_us_5b16e958e4b09578259c7adc\]

Thus far, [Trump does not appear ready to directly challenge the power
of the judiciary]{.underline} over him ― or at least his most talkative
lawyer, former prosecutor Rudolph Giuliani, does not. When [discussing
a]{.underline} hypothetical [subpoena]{.underline} by Mueller demanding
that Trump appear before a grand jury, [Giuliani]{.underline} said he
[would seek to quash it in court rather than]{.underline} just [ignore
it.]{.underline}

Mueller would surely go to court to enforce an ignored subpoena,
Giuliani said in a recent interview with HuffPost. And the special
counsel could have the president held in contempt if Trump's lawyers
lost that dispute. "We want to avoid the argument that the president is
operating above the law," Giuliani said. Multiple legal scholars contend
that Trump and his team are already arguing that he is above the law. In
a 20-page letter sent to Mueller in January, Trump's lawyers claimed
that the president, as head of the executive branch, has the authority
to end any investigation undertaken within that branch as well as to
render them moot using his pardon power. Trump has personally expanded
on that message in a number of Twitter statements in recent days. "The
appointment of the Special Counsel is totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL!" Trump
wrote Monday, shortly after tweeting, "I have the absolute right to
PARDON myself." What's more, given Trump's demonstrated willingness to
ignore established guidelines of behavior in public office, critics
worry that he might easily trigger a constitutional crisis if courts
started to rule against him. Early last year, Trump said he had recently
learned that conflict-of-interest laws did not apply to the president.
Since then, he has continued to profit from his hotels and resorts, even
from business clearly driven by his presidential position ― despite
promises during the campaign that he would separate himself from his
private company. What happens when Trump similarly realizes that nothing
in the Constitution specifically requires him to accept a Supreme Court
ruling he doesn't like and that the high court's authority largely flows
from a 215-year-old precedent? "I don't know what he would do," said one
former longtime Trump aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "I
just don't know." The White House did not respond to HuffPost's queries
about the matter. It was 1803 when Chief Justice John Marshall wrote the
opinion giving the court the power it has today in the case of Marbury
v. Madison. The Supreme Court ruled that James Madison, the secretary of
state, acted illegally but that the law passed by Congress to remedy
such situations was unconstitutional. In the process, the court
established that it has the power to declare an act of another branch of
government unconstitutional ― a precedent that the executive and
legislative branches have honored ever since.

[Turberville has been relieved to see]{.underline} the
[Trump]{.underline} administration [honoring adverse court rulings so
far]{.underline}, but she said those decisions have all concerned his
policies, such as banning visitors from predominantly Muslim nations.
Trump could behave very differently, she said, if the ruling were to
involve him personally ― upholding a subpoena requiring him to turn over
business records, for example.

President Richard Nixon complied with a Supreme Court ruling requiring
him to turn over secretly recorded tapes of his White House
conversations ― and ended up resigning just two weeks later. "The
federal courts don't have an army. They don't have a police force to
enforce their rulings," Turberville said. Instead, she said, judges rely
on people of good faith ― including officials in the other branches of
government ― to honor established norms.

"It is in the realm of possibility, hopefully not probability, that this
president would seek to upend that. And then it would fall to Congress,"
she said. "[The]{.underline} only [way]{.underline} [to head
off]{.underline} a [constitutional crisis]{.underline} of this nature
[\[would be\] for Congress to impeach]{.underline} him."

Tribe agreed that [Congress could not tolerate such behavior by the
president. "Even the Republicans in Congress who sit still as Trump
gradually violates one constitutional norm after another
may]{.underline} well [rise up against outright defiance of a Supreme
Court order]{.underline}," he said.

Norm [Eisen, the top ethics lawyer in]{.underline} President Barack
[Obama's White House and]{.underline} now a [senior fellow
at]{.underline} the [Brookings]{.underline} Institution, said that while
he's not as confident as he would like to be that Trump would honor a
court order, he [does not believe that Giuliani is ready to take on two
centuries of Supreme Court precedent.]{.underline}

["I don't think he's ready to re-litigate Marbury," Eisen
said.]{.underline}

For his part, [Giuliani told HuffPost that he's not.]{.underline}

The lawyer said Trump could not be prosecuted for any crime while he
remained president, even in an extreme hypothetical case such as if he
had shot James Comey last year rather than just firing the FBI director.
But had that actually happened, Trump would immediately have been
impeached, Giuliani said ― and then added the country was lucky not to
have had any truly violent presidents to test that theory. "Although,
what if Aaron Burr had become president?" Giuliani joked. (Burr was
Thomas Jefferson's vice president in 1804 when he challenged Alexander
Hamilton to a duel and killed him.)

While Giuliani said that Trump has broad powers under the Constitution,
he said the courts do as well. "I think ultimately [we **all agree that
the Supreme Court interprets the Constitution**," Giuliani
said.]{.underline}

#### He'll comply -- courts work with other actors and the travel ban proves

**Goldsmith 17**, \[professor at Harvard Law School and a senior fellow

the George W. Bush administration, Will Donald Trump Destroy the
Presidency?, October,
https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/10/will-donald-trump-destroy-the-presidency/537921/

Thus far, however, [Trump has been almost entirely blocked from
violating laws or the Constitution.]{.underline} The [courts, the press,
the bureaucracy, civil society, and even Congress have together
**robustly enforced the rule of law.**]{.underline}

Trump's initial executive order on immigration---a temporary ban on
entry for people from seven Muslim-majority countries that were not
obvious sources of terrorist activity inside the United States---was
widely seen as his first step toward authoritarianism. Issued seven days
into his presidency, the ban was sloppily written, barely vetted inside
the executive branch, legally overbroad, and incompetently rolled out.
The administration gave the people subject to the ban's edicts no
notice, which led to bedlam at airports. Many observers believed the
immigration order indulged the "symbolic politics of bashing Islam over
any actual security interest," as Benjamin Wittes of the Brookings
Institution put it at the time. A crucial moment occurred during the
week after Trump issued the order. Civil-society groups such as the ACLU
quickly filed habeas corpus petitions asking federal courts to enjoin
the order in various ways, which they did. For several days, it was
unclear whether border agents were complying with the injunctions, and
rumors that Trump or his Department of Homeland Security had ordered
them not to filled the news. When a federal district-court judge in
Seattle named James Robart halted the entire immigration order
nationwide in the middle of the afternoon on Friday, February 3, Twitter
and the cable shows were aquiver for several hours with the possibility
that Trump would defy the court. "What would happen if the
administration were to simply ignore this court order and continue to
deny people entry?," MSNBC national correspondent Joy Reid asked her
guests on All In. Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who
had brought the case against Trump, treated the question as a live
possibility. "I don't want to be overly dramatic, Joy," he said, "but
you would have a constitutional crisis."

[The hardest question in American constitutional law was]{.underline}
suddenly [raised: Why does a president, who controls]{.underline} what
Alexander Hamilton described as ["the sword of the community," abide by
a judicial decision he abhors?]{.underline}

[Trump wouldn't have been the first president to flout a court
order.]{.underline} Six weeks into the Civil War, Abraham [Lincoln
defied a ruling by Chief Justice]{.underline} Roger B.
[Taney]{.underline} that [the president lacked the authority to suspend
the writ of habeas corpus,]{.underline} and Franklin [Roosevelt
threatened to ignore the Supreme Court]{.underline} in a World War II
case involving Nazi saboteurs. But during the next few decades, judicial
authority solidified. Though many worried that Nixon would disobey the
Supreme Court in 1974 when it ordered him to turn over his incriminating
tapes to a special prosecutor, Nixon famously acquiesced. Would Trump?

We can imagine that he didn't want to. We can imagine him ranting
deliriously after Robart issued his decision. But at 10:05 p.m., the
White House put out a statement declaring that the Justice Department
would seek to stay the "outrageous order," which meant that the
executive branch would pursue review in higher courts. And 10 hours
later, at 8:12 a.m., the incensed chief executive tweeted the first of
many attacks against Robart. "The opinion of this so-called judge, which
essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous
and will be overturned!," Trump wrote. He would appeal, rather than
defy, Robart's injunction.

We don't know why Trump acquiesced. Perhaps his staff convinced him that
[ignoring the ruling would spark resignations in the White House and the
Justice Department, as well as congressional reprisal, which would
jeopardize his]{.underline} two-week-old [presidency.]{.underline}
Whatever the reason, [the most powerful man in the world complied with
the edict of a little-known federal trial judge on an issue at the top
of his agenda. The Constitution held.]{.underline}

as well as the White House's unflagging support for the Saudis despite
congressional pressure to punish Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman after
the killing in October of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi]{.underline}. A
United Nations report released Wednesday made the most authoritative
case to date that responsibility for the killing and its cover-up lies
at the highest levels of the Saudi royal court. [No other foreign policy
issue has created as large a rift between President Trump and Congress,
and the vote to block the arms sales deepens the divide. It is the
second time in just a few months that members of Mr. Trump's party have
publicly opposed his foreign policy, with both the House and Senate
approving bipartisan legislation this spring to cut off military
assistance to Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen using the 1973 War Powers Act,
only to see it vetoed]{.underline}. While the Democrat-controlled House
is also expected to block the sales, Mr. Trump has pledged to veto the
legislation, and it is unlikely that either chamber could muster enough
support to override the president's veto. [Seven Republicans --- not
nearly enough to override a veto --- broke from their party to
disapprove of the sales to Saudi Arabia: Senator Susan Collins of Maine,
Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Senator Mike Lee of Utah,
Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Senator
Rand Paul of Kentucky and Senator Todd Young of Indiana.]{.underline}
"This vote is a vote for the powers of this institution to be able to
continue to have a say on one of the most critical elements of U.S.
foreign policy and national security," said Senator Robert Menendez of
New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee and lead
sponsor of the resolutions of disapproval. ["To not let that be
undermined by some false emergency and to preserve that institutional
right, regardless of who sits in the White House." The White House
announced the sales late last month, and invoked an emergency provision
in the Arms Export Control Act to allow American companies to sell \$8.1
billion worth of munitions in 22 pending transfers to the three Arab
nations.]{.underline} Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are
waging an air war in Yemen that has come under sharp criticism from
Congress and human rights organizations. Members of Congress from both
parties have been holding up arms sales from American companies to
Persian Gulf nations and trying to end American military support for the
Saudi-led coalition that is fighting Houthi rebels in Yemen, which has
resulted in what the United Nations calls the world's worst man-made
humanitarian disaster. [By declaring an emergency over Iran, the
administration was able to override those holds.]{.underline} "If we let
this emergency declaration go without protest, without a vote, I don't
know that we're ever getting the power to oversee arms sales back as a
body," said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, and
one of the authors of the resolution. [Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
had pushed hard for the emergency designation, over the objections of
career Foreign Service officers and legislators, arguing that the sales
would support allies like Saudi Arabia to counter Iran and its partner
Arab militias --- though some of the munitions would take years to
produce and deliver.]{.underline} In the weeks after the declaration was
announced, lawmakers have scrutinized the role that a former Raytheon
lobbyist played in the decision. In our video, a former State Department
official sent to advise the Saudi-led coalition says he saw firsthand
how it failed to avoid civilian casualties in Yemen --- and how the U.S.
chose to look the other way. [Some Senate Republicans endorsed the
administration's position on Thursday, arguing that rejecting the arms
sales would be overly blunt with unintended consequences as tensions
with Iran escalate. The question the Senate will consider, Senator Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said, "is whether we'll lash
out at an imperfect partner and undercut our own efforts to build
cooperation, check Iran and achieve other important goals, or whether
we'll keep our imperfect partners close and use our
influence.]{.underline}" But the administration's argument ultimately
fell flat even for some of the president's closest allies, like Mr.
Graham, who co-sponsored the legislation with Mr. Menendez. "The reason
I'm voting with Senator Paul and others today is to send a signal to
Saudi Arabia that if you act the way you're acting, there is no space
for a strategic relationship," he said. "There is no amount of oil you
can produce that will get me and others to give you a pass on chopping
somebody up in a consulate." [The original legislation Mr. Menendez and
Mr. Graham introduced would have forced senators to vote on 22 separate
resolutions of disapproval, one vote for each arms sale. But a deal
struck with Mr. McConnell grouped the resolutions into three
votes]{.underline} --- and also ensured that the Foreign Relations
Committee will take up a bill sponsored by Mr. Menendez that would
curtail the ability of the president to use emergency authority to sell
arms. [The vote came the same day that Britain announced it would
temporarily suspend approval of any new licenses to sell arms to Saudi
Arabia, after an unexpected court ruling that ministers had acted
unlawfully in allowing the sale of weapons when there was a clear
possibility they might be used in violation of international
humanitarian law in Yemen.]{.underline}

#### Even if Trump tries to change the Munitions List, Congress will block him

**Committee on Foreign Relations 16** \[United States Senate on Foreign
Relations, A Committee in the Senate that creates and changes US Foreign
Policy, \"MENENDEZ ANNOUNCES HOLD ON TRUMP ADMIN'S PROPOSED MOVE TO
WEAKEN REGULATORY CONTROL OVER U.S. GUNS SALES ABROAD," Ranking Members'
Press, February 26, 2019,
<https://www.foreign.senate.gov/press/ranking/release/menendez-announces-hold-on-trump-admins-proposed-move-to-weaken-regulatory-control-over-us-guns-sales-abroad>[\]]{.underline}

WASHINGTON-- [Senator Bob Menendez]{.underline} [(D-N.J.), Ranking
Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, sent a letter to
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressing his concern about a proposal
to drastically weaken firearms export regulations, and announcing he
will not allow the proposed rules to move forward unless the State
Department fully addresses the dangerous and far-reaching implications
of this proposal prior to its taking effect. In a move designed to
stifle Congressional oversight and weaken controls over exports of guns
from the United States, the Trump Administration announced last month
that it will formally seek to transfer control of the export of
semi-automatic pistols, assault-style rifles, sniper rifles and
ammunition from the United States Munition List (USML) under the
authority of the Department of State to the less-stringent controls of
the Department of Commerce. As part of the move, the Administration also
seeks to transfer the control of the technical information and
blueprints for nearly undetectable 3D Guns from State to Commerce, where
lax regulations will facilitate printing of 3D guns
worldwide.]{.underline} "\[Firearms\] are easily modified, diverted, and
proliferated, and are the primary means of injury, death, and
destruction in civil and military conflicts throughout the world. As
such, they should be subject to more, not less, rigorous export controls
and oversight," wrote Menendez. As the top Senate Democrat with
oversight on U.S. firearms exports and weapons sales, [Menendez
announced he would refuse to consent to formal congressional
notification of the proposed transfer until the Trump administration is
more forthcoming in responding to his questions and concerns.
Specifically, Menendez listed his concerns that all Congressional
oversight and right of disapproval over firearms sales to countries of
concern would be eliminated, despite Congress tightening such oversight
under law; and that Commerce has admitted that it will not control or
prevent the global internet publication of 3D printing of
nearly-undetectable guns by terrorist groups, a real danger to American
embassies, military bases, and passenger air carriers abroad. Despite
the new statutory requirements on the President and Secretary of
Commerce to control emerging technologies like 3D printing, the
Administration is seeking in effect to eliminate meaningful control over
3D gun printing.]{.underline} "By proceeding with the transfer of
firearms, including 3D printing technical information, to Commerce, the
Administration is acting recklessly and endangering innocent lives. It
should go without saying that we collectively need to understand the
threat and have a plan to address this issue before making the
regulatory change," added the Senator, [specifically raising concerns
about the capability to 3D-print lethal weaponry that cannot easily be
detected by metal detectors at airports, schools, or government
facilities. Earlier this month, Senator Menendez also led a group of his
colleagues in introducing the Stopping the Traffic in Overseas
Proliferation of Ghost Guns Act, legislation that would statutorily
prohibit this transfer, and therefore maintain the strict controls over
firearms and 3D printed "ghost gun" information that currently exist on
the United States Munitions List.]{.underline} As a champion for major
gun safety reforms, Sen. Menendez was an outspoken opponent of the Trump
Administration's action last year allowing a Texas company to publish
the downloadable designs for 3D printable firearms, which was later
blocked by a federal court, and has taken a series of additional actions
to prevent the proliferation of untraceable, undetectable 3D printed
guns. He called on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to intervene and
reverse his department's decision and spoke out about his decision at a
hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The text of the
letter announcing the hold can be found here and below: Dear Secretary
Pompeo: On February 4, 2019, I received a congressional notification
from the Department for a proposal to transfer responsibility for the
export control of firearms and ammunition from the United States
Munitions list (USML) to the Commerce Control List (CCL). I write to
inform you that I am placing a hold on the congressional notification,
pursuant to the authority of Section 38(f) of the Arms Export Control
Act (AECA). I am deeply concerned about this proposed transfer. As you
no doubt are aware, firearms and ammunition -- especially those derived
from military models and widely used by military and security services
-- are uniquely dangerous. They are easily modified, diverted, and
proliferated, and are the primary means of injury, death, and
destruction in civil and military conflicts throughout the world. As
such, they should be subject to more, not less, rigorous export controls
and oversight. Combat rifles, including those commonly known as "sniper
rifles," should not be removed from the USML, nor should rifles of any
type that are U.S. military-standard 5.56 (and especially .50 caliber).
Semi-automatic firearms should also not be removed, and neither should
related equipment, ammunition, or associated manufacturing equipment,
technology, or technical data. Consequently, my hold will remain in
place until such time as the issues identified below are sufficiently
addressed. 1) Removal of Firearms Exports from Congressional Information
and Review The AECA enables congressional review of exports of lethal
weapons to ensure that they comport with U.S. foreign policy interests.
Congress took action in 2002 to ensure that the sale and export of these
weapons would receive stringent oversight, including by amending the
AECA to set a lower reporting threshold (from \$14 million to \$1
million) specifically for firearms on the USML. Moving such firearms
from the USML to the CCL would directly contradict congressional intent
and effectively eliminate congressional oversight and potential
disapproval of exports of these weapons. Congressional oversight must be
retained. 2) Proliferation of 3D Gun Printing Technical Information
There is a serious risk that this transfer will open the floodgates of
information for the 3D printing of nearly-undetectable firearms and
components by foreign persons and terrorists that intend to harm U.S.
citizens and interests. [The Department of Commerce claims that it
cannot, by its own regulations, prevent the publication, including on
the Internet for global consumption, of technical information and
blueprint files that would enable this 3D production, if such
information has once been published, even illegally. This is outrageous
and simply unacceptable given the dangers it poses to U.S. citizens and
interests. Moreover, it may also be at variance with recent law. Section
1758 of the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 authorizes the Secretary
of Commerce to control "emerging and foundational technologies" that (A)
are essential to the national security of the United States; and (B) are
not critical technologies described in clauses (i) through (v) of
section 721(a)(6)(A) of the Defense Production Act of 1950. 3D printing
has been identified by this Administration as an emerging technology of
concern, and the Department of Commerce itself used 3D printing as an
example of "emerging technology" in its November 19, 2018 Federal
Register notice seeking public comment on what constitutes emerging
technologies pursuant to this new statutory charge.]{.underline}
Then-Secretary of Defense Mattis twice mentioned the challenges of 3D
printing in congressional testimony, and Director of National
Intelligence Coats, in his 2018 Worldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S.
Intelligence Community, stated that, "\[a\]dvances in manufacturing,
particularly the development of 3D printing, almost certainly will
become even more accessible to a variety of state and non-state actors
and be used in ways contrary to our interests." It would seem axiomatic
that the capability to 3D-print lethal weaponry that cannot easily or
reliably be detected by metal detectors at airports, schools,
governmental or other facilities (including the U.S. Capitol and the
Department of State) would qualify as an emerging technology in need of
regulatory control. Yet, the Commerce Department has told my staff that
the interagency process to identify emerging and foundational
technologies to be controlled has not been completed, and is unlikely to
be completed for months. [By proceeding with the transfer of firearms,
including 3D printing technical information, to Commerce, the
Administration is acting recklessly and endangering innocent lives. It
should go without saying that we collectively need to understand the
threat and have a plan to address this issue before making the
regulatory change. Moreover, the Department of Commerce would seem to
have adequate additional regulatory authority to control 3D gun printing
information, at least temporarily. Commerce can control any item for
foreign policy reasons under the miscellaneous category of 0Y521,
according to a final rule issued by Commerce in 2012. Preventing foreign
terrorists and thugs from acquiring the means to print undetectable guns
to use against U.S. citizens is a sufficient foreign policy
justification to control this technology from public
release.]{.underline} Ultimately, the specific provision of the Export
Administration Regulations is cited as preventing Commerce from
controlling the publication of 3D Printed guns in the longer term needs
to be rewritten to permit this control. Until that occurs, or until
Commerce determines that such technical information can and will be
controlled, this technical information cannot and should not be
transferred from USML to the CCL. I look forward to your prompt response
to my concerns.

### 2AC -- AT: Free Transfers 

#### Trump only cares about arms sales -- free transfers don't get jobs.

Jonathan **Caverley**, 4-6-20**18**, \"America\'s Arms Sales Policy:
Security Abroad, Not Jobs at Home,\" War on the Rocks,
<https://warontherocks.com/2018/04/americas-arms-sales-policy-security-abroad-not-jobs-at-home/>
Caverly is an undergrad teaching assistant at Rutgers University.

Announcing an impressive, if overstated, \$110 billion worth of arms
deals with Saudi Arabia last year, President Donald [Trump **made clear
the primary motivation for the agreements: "job, jobs,
jobs."**]{.underline} The administration is now poised to expand this
effort in what officials have described as a "whole of government" push,
easing export regulation and oversight [to increase arms
sales]{.underline} around the world. This "Arms Transfer Initiative"
fits neatly into Trump's broader efforts to create manufacturing jobs in
the United States. In this spirit, [the administration has already
reversed]{.underline} Obama-era [human rights-related restrictions on
arms sales]{.underline} to Saudi, Bahrain, and Nigeria.

The initiative has yet to be released, but its parameters seem clear.
Regulations of arms sales will be reduced. There will be "more public
advocacy for foreign partners to buy American." According to the Trump
administration, military and diplomatic officials have been
"underutilized by previous presidents;" as one senior administration
official put it, "[We want to see those guys, the commercial and
military attachés, **unfettered to be salesmen** for this stuff, to be
promoters]{.underline}." This would, according to the official,
represent a "180-degree shift" in America's current "arms-length
approach to foreign weapons sales." Another unnamed administration
official said the new approach will conform to the "America First"
policy of "[better aligning]{.underline} our national security and
foreign policy objectives as well as [economic imperatives]{.underline}
for American jobs."

#### Trump's only interested in sales for profit -- no motive to circumvent.

**Hartung 18** \[William D. Hartung, 4-19-2018, \"Trump's arms sales
policy puts contractors above common sense,\" TheHill,
https://thehill.com/opinion/international/384014-trumps-arms-sales-policy-puts-contractors-above-common-sense\]

In a move that poses grave risks to U.S. security, [the Trump
administration's newly released conventional arms transfer policy will
**put jobs and the interests of arms manufacturers** ahead
of]{.underline} safety, [security]{.underline}, and human rights in its
decisions on who the United States should arm.

[This bias should come as no surprise given President **Trump's penchant
for promoting U.S. weapons sales and touting the jobs that they
create**. From calling foreign leaders to urge them to speed up
purchases]{.underline} of U.S. combat aircraft [to using a White House
meeting with the Saudi crown prince to brag about which states would
gain jobs]{.underline} from specific sales to Riyadh, President [Trump
seems to be **obsessed with the alleged economic benefits** of the
weapons trade.]{.underline}

[Given its numerous mentions of creating jobs, making life easier for
weapons contractors, and bolstering the U.S. defense industrial
base,]{.underline} one might think [the Trump administration's new
directive is a **statement of economic policy** rather than]{.underline}
a carefully crafted expression of [national security
concerns.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- AT: Saudi Circumvention 

#### He only cares about [profit]{.underline} and [jobs]{.underline} so he wouldn't [them away]{.underline} for [free]{.underline} -- the relationship is [strictly]{.underline} transactional 

**Ulrichsen 18** \[Kristian Coates 3-22, Non-resident Senior Fellow at

Middle East at Rice University. ("Trump's Transactional Relationship
with Saudi Arabia"
<http://arabcenterdc.org/viewpoint/trumps-transactional-relationship-with-saudi-arabia/>\]

The March 21, 2018 press conference between US President Donald
**[Trump]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} Saudi Arabian Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman (**[MBS]{.underline}**) [must rank among the
most]{.underline} **[surreal encounters]{.underline}** [between two
world leaders, and it did little to dispel the notion that Trump is a
**transactional president**]{.underline} [with little regard
for]{.underline} **[diplomatic niceties]{.underline}**. This was evident
in July 2017, when he bragged to the Christian Broadcasting Network that
he had made his May 2017 visit to Saudi Arabia conditional on the
announcement of billions in commercial agreements and arms sales,
claiming, "I said, you have to do that, otherwise I'm not going." In his
meeting with MBS this week, ten months after that visit, [Trump produced
a cardboard cutout of planned Saudi arms purchases and started reeling
off the figures in front of the crown prince, who seemed both
**embarrassed** and **amused**]{.underline} at the spectacle. At one
point, however, MBS shook his head vigorously when the president turned
to one sale and said, "...But if you look, in terms of dollars, \$3
billion, \$533 million, \$525 million----that's peanuts for you. You
should have increased it." [Saudi officials have celebrated the
"**renaissance**]{.underline}" [of a bilateral relationship that soured
badly during the Obama Administration, with Arab News headlining their
coverage of the White House visit with the phrase "United
States]{.underline}" (just as the crown prince's visit to London earlier
in March was tagged "United Kingdoms"). In the same spirit, Arab News
editor Faisal Abbas referred to "The Art of the Deal" and suggested that
Saudi investment and support were pivotal to the president's "America
First" strategy and the creation of new skilled jobs for American
workers. [While there is much merit to these arguments,]{.underline}
President [Trump's demeanor and tone during the public portion of his
meeting with MBS appeared as if he treated his Saudi visitors as merely
a source]{.underline} [of]{.underline} **[money]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[opportunity]{.underline}**. [For a president
who]{.underline}, three years before he took office in 2017, tweeted[,
"Tell Saudi Arabia and others that we want (demand) free oil for the
next ten years or we will not protect their private Boeing 747s. Pay
up]{.underline}!," **[this ought to be neither new nor a
surprise]{.underline}**. For decades, the bedrock of the United States'
relations with its political and security partners in the Gulf evolved
far beyond a simple "oil-for-security" equation, to which the media
sometimes reduces it. The basis for bilateral ties with all six Gulf
states has become institutionalized since the 1980s and---ironically, in
view of Gulf rulers' poor personal chemistry with President Obama---the
Obama Administration did more than its predecessors to complement
bilateral US links with individual Gulf states with stronger US ties to
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) as a bloc. In March 2012, the Obama
Administration created a GCC-US Strategic Cooperation Forum and at its
2013 ministerial meeting launched a joint US-GCC Security Committee to
address issues of common interest such as counterterrorism. A further
breakthrough came in December 2013 when President Obama issued a
presidential determination that made it possible, for the first time,
for the United States to sell arms to the GCC as a bloc. Ironically,
then, for all their denunciations of the Obama Administration---to which
Trump himself alluded in his Oval Office comments---Obama did at least
make efforts to work collectively with the GCC rather than just
bilaterally with each individual state. The GCC has, of course, been
weakened considerably by the ten-month standoff between three Gulf
States---Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)---and
Qatar, which erupted two days after Trump's visit to Riyadh in May last
year. Rumors that the United States is set to establish a trilateral
security committee with Saudi Arabia and the UAE to work on countering
Iran add weight to perceptions that the policy-making focus of Trump's
White House aligns more closely with Saudi and Emirati interests in the
region, especially after the nomination of CIA Director Mike Pompeo to
replace Rex Tillerson as secretary of state. [At present, US hopes for a
sequential effort to mediate in the Gulf crisis, in advance of a planned
Camp David summit that would seal a reconciliation deal, are now on
hold.]{.underline} **[Policy-making]{.underline}** [under]{.underline}
the **[Trump]{.underline}** Administration [is clearly going to be
highly transactional at the **best of times**]{.underline}. [Although a
bilateral relationship stripped of "**values**," such as concerns for
good governance or human rights, undoubtedly removes points of friction,
the corollary is that]{.underline} President [Trump is so]{.underline}
**[unpredictable]{.underline}** [that he could one day turn against the
Saudis or Emiratis just as he turned against the Qataris **last
summer**]{.underline}. [The weakening of the institutional bases of the
US relationship leaves it more vulnerable to the whims of personality,
and rational heads watching Trump's behavior during the public portion
of his meeting with MBS may not find it at all reassuring]{.underline}.
[Nor will **Saudis**]{.underline} [necessarily be comfortable with the
notion that large sums of state money]{.underline}---dismissed casually
as "peanuts" by the president---w[ill go to projects that provide jobs
for American workers rather than in Saudi Arabia, where job creation is
sorely needed to take the strain off the public sector and enable MBS to
deliver on his Vision 2030 promises.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- AT: CCL 

#### CCL spurs a [massive fight]{.underline} and gets [blocked]{.underline} by Congress 

**McShane 19** \[Jim McShane, Consultant, Trade Compliance for Export
Solutions \-- a full-service consulting firm specializing in ITAR and
EAR regulations. ("Will firearms (finally) change under Export Control
Reform?"
<https://www.exportsolutionsinc.com/resources/blog/firearms-export-control-reform/>\]

On May 24, 2018, [the Departments of State and Commerce published
proposed revisions to]{.underline} U.S. Munitions List
(**[USML]{.underline}**) [Categories]{.underline} I, II, and III in the
Federal Register. These three categories would be the last USML
categories to be revised under the Export Control Reform Initiative -- a
process that began more than nine years ago and that we first blogged
about here. [Public Comments to the proposed revisions were
**solicited** and]{.underline} **[required]{.underline}** [to be
submitted]{.underline} within 45 days. From that point forward, once the
final language of the revisions were accepted and approved, [the
President would notify Congress and the Final Rule outlining the changes
would be published]{.underline}. So what has happened since then? Rumors
have abounded. Some in the trade community believed the end of 2018 was
a target date for publication. Others thought the announcement would be
made in January 2019. Some even believed the administration might
implement the changes to coincide with the Shot Show -- one of the
firearm industry's largest trade shows (which occurred this year from
January 22-25). **[None of these things occurred]{.underline}**. [In the
meantime, Congress **is not waiting** to be **notified** by the
President on the Final Rule. There have been two legislative initiatives
to stop the transition of items from the **USML** to the
**CCL**]{.underline}: "Stopping the Traffic in Overseas Proliferation of
Ghost Guns Act" (no H.R. number assigned yet) Specifically[, this
legislation would: Prohibit the transfer of small arms/light weapons,
and the technical manufacturing information related to them]{.underline}
(including 3D printed guns), [to the Department of Commerce; Maintain
the statutory restriction on publishing 3D printed gun information,
including over the internet; Prohibit the ability of the State
Department to suspend the International Traffic in Arms Regulations
(ITAR) without 30-day prior notice to Congress]{.underline}. "Prevent
Crime and Terrorism Act of 2018" (H.R.4765) This bill would amend the
Arms Export Control Act to prohibit the President from removing any of
the following items under USML Categories I, II, or III (firearms,
armament, ammunition) in order to transfer them to the Commerce Control
List: Significant Military Equipment or their components, parts, or
accessories; Flame throwers designed or modified for military
application; or Devices for launching or delivering ordnance. More
recently, a senior Senator has blocked the proposed Final Rule, citing
that the transition of these designated items would deny Congress
oversight on export transactions meeting certain levels and increase the
risk of military-grade weapons falling into the hands of terrorists.
[The proposal to **block** the **proposed Final Rule**]{.underline} [is
not legally binding, but it will establish another area of confrontation
between the President and Congress]{.underline} if the President decides
to proceed with the publication of the Final Rule and the notification
to Congress. [At this point, the date for the transition of items
currently classified as ITAR controlled is mere
**guesswork**]{.underline}. [That said, increased Congressional
activities over the past few weeks would indicate **action** is either
**not far off**, or will be **delayed** for some time.]{.underline}

#### Congress has [substantial control]{.underline} and [eliminates]{.underline} executive discretion 

**ABA 13** \[voluntary bar association of lawyers and law students**.**
"Proposals to Relax Export Controls for Significant Military Equipment"
<https://bit.ly/2X2o4J6>\]

[While the Administration has authority to determine what constitutes a
**defense article**]{.underline}, the [Congress]{.underline} [clearly
intended for "**significant military equipment**]{.underline}" [that has
"substantial military utility" to be subject to the special controls of
the **AECA**]{.underline}.12 Semi-automatic rifles that can fire up to
60 rounds per minute clearly have substantial military utility. It is
therefore inconsistent with the AECA to transfer such items from the
USML where they will no longer be subject to the special controls of
that statute. [Contrary to the Administration's assertion in these
proposed rulemakings, Congress has established **constraints on the
Executive**]{.underline} Branch [that go beyond AECA's notice
requirements]{.underline}. Indeed, [Congress did not intend to give the
President **unfettered discretion**]{.underline} [in determining which
items should be placed on the **USML**]{.underline}, [but rather made
clear that certain defense articles considered to be "**significant
military equipment**]{.underline}" [must be more closely
controlled.]{.underline} ITAR has long identified SME as those defense
articles "for which special export controls are warranted because of
their capacity for substantial military utility or capability," 22
C.F.R. § 120.19(a) (1984), 22 C.F.R. § 120.7(a) (1997), and has clearly
distinguished those items on the USML. Congress, in its 1996 revisions
to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, 22 U.S.C. § 2151 et seq., and
AECA, amended AECA to include a definition for SME, which had previously
only been defined in ITAR. See Pub. L. No. 104-164, § 144, 110 Stat.
1421, 1434 (1996) (codified at 22 U.S.C. § 2794(9)). [Congress's
definition]{.underline}, however, [merely copied the definition of SME
from ITAR---SME are defense articles "for which special export controls
are warranted because of the capacity of such articles for substantial
military utility or capability" and "identified on the
\[**USML**]{.underline}\]." 22 U.S.C. § 2794(9)(A)--(B) (see also H.R.
REP. NO. 104-519, pt. 1, at 10 (1996)) (stating that "Section 144 amends
the Arms Export Control Act to provide a definition of significant
military equipment as defined in the International Traffic in Arms
Regulations (ITAR)").
