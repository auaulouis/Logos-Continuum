#### Interpretation: *[Reduction]{.underline}* of arms sales is distinct from *[restriction]{.underline}* or *[management]{.underline}* and must include quantitative or qualitative *[ceilings]{.underline}* or *[explicitly curtail weapon exports]{.underline}* 

**[Pearson 88]{.underline}**

(Frederic S. Pearson, Prof. of Political Science and Fellow at the
Center of International Studies @ University of Missouri-St Louis, *Arms
Transfer Limitations and Third World Security*, ed. Thomas Ohlson, SIPRI
publication, pgs. 129-130)

Based on these general perspectives, second-tier suppliers have
formulated both unilateral and multilateral positions on the management,
restriction or reduction of Third World arms transfers. These are
examined separately in order to assess the restraints most likely to be
adopted in the future. **[Arms trade *management*]{.underline}**,
whether unilateral or multilateral, **[implies rules for reporting or
licensing sales in specific circumstances]{.underline}**, as well as
potential market sharing arrangements. **[*Restriction* of sales entails
disapproval]{.underline}**, **[banning or embargoes to specific states
or classes of states or of specific types of weapon]{.underline}**.
**[*Reduction* of transfers includes]{.underline}** more sweeping
measures, such as **[qualitative or quantitative limits or
ceilings]{.underline}**, **[and deliberate government policies or
international agreements designed to curtail weapon
exports]{.underline}**. In the process of devising restraints, there can
be trade-offs, such as restraints on transferring arms versus the
technology or equipment to make or use them, on naval versus air versus
land systems, or on weapon deliveries versus new sales agreements.

#### Violation: the aff doesn't reduce arms quantitatively or qualitatively.

#### Reduce means *[diminish]{.underline}* and *[cannot mean increase]{.underline}*

**[US Federal Court of Appeals 99]{.underline}**

("CUNA MUTUAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, Plaintiff-Appellant, v. UNITED
STATES, Defendant-Appellee," Lexis)

\"The amount determined\" under § 809, by which the policyholder
dividend deduction is to be \"reduced,\" is the \"excess\" specified in
§ 809(c)(1). Like the word \"excess,\" **[the word \"reduced\" is a
common]{.underline}**, unambiguous, non-technical **[term]{.underline}**
that is **[given its ordinary meaning]{.underline}**. See San Joaquin
Fruit & Inv. Co., 297 U.S. at 499. **[\"Reduce\"]{.underline}** **[means
\"to diminish in size, amount, extent, or number.\"]{.underline}**
Webster\'s Third International Dictionary 1905. Under CUNA\'s
interpretation of \"excess\" in § 809(c), however, the result of the
\"amount determination\" under § 809 would be not to reduce the
policyholder dividends deduction, but to increase it. This would
directly contradict the explicit instruction in § 808(c)(2) that the
deduction \"be reduced.\" **[The word \"reduce\" cannot be
interpreted]{.underline}**, as CUNA would treat it, **[to mean
\"increase.\"]{.underline}**

#### "Substantially reduce" means *[abolishing entire categories of arms]{.underline}*

**[Near the Cold War's end, leaders in Washington and Moscow made
reciprocal unilateral pledges to substantially]{.underline}** limit and
**[reduce their nuclear weaponry]{.underline}**, **[most
notably]{.underline}** their **[tactical]{.underline}** or "battlefield"
**[nuclear weapons]{.underline}**, such as nuclear artillery shells.
President George H.W. Bush initiated these commitments, collectively
known as the Presidential Nuclear Initiatives (PNIs), in September 1991
in recognition of the break up of the Eastern bloc and out of concern
for the Kremlin's ability to maintain control of its vast nuclear
arsenal as political changes swept the Soviet Union. **[By pledging to
end foreign deployments of entire categories of U.S. tactical nuclear
weapons, Bush hoped that leaders in Moscow would follow
suit]{.underline}**; and they did, at least in part. All Soviet nuclear
weapons were reportedly successfully consolidated on Russian soil.
Still, Washington alleges Moscow has not yet fulfilled all of its PNI
destruction commitments. Meanwhile, Russia opposes the continued
stationing of U.S. tactical nuclear gravity bombs in Europe, which the
PNIs did not cover. Despite lingering concerns about each other's
tactical nuclear weapons, the two sides have not negotiated further
reductions or transparency measures for these arms since the early
1990s.

[There are two parts to Defense Secretary]{.underline} James [Mattis\'s
trip to the Far East this week to woo countries **away from Russia and
China: charm and arms**]{.underline}.

As President Donald Trump talks (and tweets) about [an \"America First\"
foreign policy]{.underline} that will have us \"winning\" again, it
[falls to officials]{.underline} like Mattis [to convince countries to
lean **toward the United States and away from**]{.underline} their close
neighbor **[China and]{.underline}** ever-present arms maker
**[Russia]{.underline}**.

So, for starters, Mattis has been smiling---a lot. On the just-concluded
Indonesian swing of this trip, he kept grinning during a demonstration
by Indonesian troops that included both snake blood and men rappelling
from helicopters with German shepherds strapped to their chests. And he
smiled later as he left Indonesia on the cusp of an agreement to sell 48
F-16 fighter jets the world\'s biggest Muslim nation.

Mattis landed in Vietnam on Wednesday with a similar challenge, this
time showing up a day after Russia's defense minister made his best
pitch for Russian weapons in Hanoi. The timing makes Mattis something of
a de facto secretary of state.

"What we're looking for here is that small nations get the same respect,
the same regard, as large nations," Mattis said. He was describing the
trip to reporters earlier on the flight from Washington aboard his E4-B
aircraft, which is outfitted to run a nuclear war and is affectionately
known as the "doomsday plane." "Every nation matters, and there cannot
be any bullying or shredding of trust toward others.\"

Washington is concerned that **[China]{.underline}**, in the midst of a
land grab for every rock in the South China Sea, **[will come to
dominate the smaller countries]{.underline}** that rim that body of
water, **[and]{.underline}** that **[Russia will become their arms
dealer of choice]{.underline}**.

"**[They're going to fill in vacuums if the U.S. isn't
there]{.underline}**," said Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for
South and Southeast Asia Joe Felter, who joined Mattis on the trip. "[We
look at **China and Russia as competitors**, and certainly some of their
actions should give these countries a reason for concern]{.underline}."

the Liberal Order Posted on: 21st June 2018

What does this mean for democracies? **[Autocracies present a series
of]{.underline}** individual **[challenges]{.underline}** to their local
rivals: **[Russia to the Baltic states, China to Taiwan and North Korea
to South Korea]{.underline}**, for instance. But **[the problem they
pose to world order is larger than the sum of these issues. It
is]{.underline}**, rather, **[an ideological]{.underline}** and systemic
**[challenge that will reshape the norms of international relations.
Will these norms reflect liberal principles such as
openness]{.underline}**, rule following and individual rights **[or
competing authoritarian ones such as secrecy, arbitrariness and state
power]{.underline}**?

**[This competition over norms will influence]{.underline}** not only
Western liberal democracies but also **[the wider multipolar order that
is emerging. In regions with weak political institutions]{.underline}**
or nascent democracies---parts of **[Africa, South and Southeast
Asia]{.underline}**, and **[East and Southeast Europe---the regional
order is especially malleable. If authoritarian states can shape these
regions]{.underline}** in their own image, **[this]{.underline}**
bolsters their global standing and **[puts liberal democracy further on
the back foot]{.underline}**. This argument does not require an
acceptance that democracies always act in liberal ways or adhere to a
single and consistent set of norms. Authoritarian states also differ
widely in levels of openness and repression, the balance between
civilian and military authority, and civil versus political freedoms.11
Yet despite this variety, there remain systematic differences between
democratic and authoritarian states in attitude, inclination and
values---and **[this has important]{.underline}** foreign policy
**[implications]{.underline}**.

TYPES OF AUTHORITARIAN CHALLENGE

The authoritarian challenge to liberal democracy can be broken down into
six categories.

**[The Military Challenge]{.underline}**

**[Authoritarian states represent the most serious military threat to
the democracies of Europe and Asia. Russia has dissolved]{.underline}**
existing **[norms regarding the use of force]{.underline}**, conducting
in Europe the first annexation of territory and the first use of
chemical weapons since the Second World War.12 **[Russia's use of hybrid
warfare]{.underline}**, which prioritises secrecy, deception and
political warfare, **[presents a]{.underline}** particular **[danger to
rule-bound open societies]{.underline}**.13 **[China]{.underline}**,
though more cautious, **[has]{.underline}** also **[demonstrated
increasingly assertive behaviour in the South China Sea]{.underline}**,
including the militarisation of reclaimed islands, the rejection of
arbitration efforts **[and an escalation of the country's border dispute
with India]{.underline}**.14

The military challenge posed by authoritarian states is not a quirk of
the past few years. Russian and Chinese behaviour is rooted in their
resentment of the Western order, ambition for great power status and
fear of Western power.15 All three of **[these drivers are shaped by
these countries' authoritarian political systems. The best available
scholarship continues to show that democracies enjoy more peaceful
relations with other democracies than with autocracies]{.underline}**,
suggesting that **[authoritarian states are intrinsically more likely to
be threatening]{.underline}**.16 **[Among states that ratify treaties
governing the laws of war, democracies are]{.underline}** also **[more
likely to comply with these rules than autocracies are]{.underline}**.17

The Coercion Challenge

Military threats are the most serious form of coercion, but more common
is the use of broader, often more subtle, political and economic
pressure to intimidate and cajole liberal democracies into changing
their behaviour. **[Authoritarian countries use coercion to secure
specific interests, such as China's successful embargo and isolation of
Norway]{.underline}** after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to a
dissident in 2010, **[or]{.underline}** to influence a country's
strategic orientation, such as **[Russia's use of intimidation to scare
neutral countries]{.underline}**, such as Sweden and Finland, away from
the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). All countries use
coercion; consider Western sanctions on Iran and Russia. But autocrats
typically do so to counter threats to their rule or to uphold spheres of
influence abroad, both of which require confronting and undercutting
democracy in other states.18

For instance, China's use of its market power to coerce academic
publishers into curbing access to scholarship and technology firms into
censoring their products points to a gradual and insidious encroachment
on free speech; so does the increasing frequency with which
international firms feel compelled to apologise to China for ideological
infractions, such as acknowledging Taiwan's nationhood or publishing
noncompliant maps.19 The growth of China's strategic investments and
Russia's deepening control over energy supplies represent particular
European vulnerabilities, both of which could be used for future
coercion for a variety of purposes.20

**[Other examples of authoritarian coercion include Turkey's campaign to
put pressure on dissident groups abroad, Iran's efforts to target the
Iran-based families of critical foreign media outlets and Russia's
assassinations in Europe]{.underline}**.21 Turkey has even threatened to
conduct operations against Western rating agencies that have done as
little as downgrade the country's credit score.22 Such actions will all
have similar long-term chilling effects, unless these campaigns are
blunted.

The Influence Challenge

In addition to overt coercion, **[authoritarian states deploy more
subtle means to reshape the intellectual climate of democracies in their
favour]{.underline}**. One tactic is to cultivate sympathetic
intellectual and political networks through open or clandestine means,
including the funding of educational or research institutes, and the
intensive use of political lobbying to influence political leaders.23
Another is to suppress negative press while rewarding and encouraging
more pliant coverage, through selective access and other means. Yet
another is the development of alternative media channels to spread
propaganda and sow confusion.24

Liberal **[democratic states are]{.underline}** by definition **[open.
This makes them]{.underline}** especially **[vulnerable to authoritarian
influence campaigns]{.underline}**, which not only distort national
debates about how to respond to that very challenge but also undermine
the respect for information and faith in objective truth on which the
proper functioning of democracy depends. Influence operations exploit
and compound the problem of declining trust in news media, with levels
of trust well below 50 per cent in the United Kingdom (UK), below 40 per
cent in the United States (US) and at 30 per cent in France.25 Russia's
use of state-controlled print and broadcast media to spread
disinformation around its military and covert actions is the starkest
example.26 At times, Russia has leveraged its influence into direct
intervention, notably in its attempted coup in Montenegro in 2016,
demonstrating how these different types of challenges---physical and
ideological---can meld together.27

China has pursued a less provocative, if no less troubling, approach.28
Beijing's state-controlled media outlets are growing rapidly and
increasing their footprint in Western democracies.29 There is mounting
evidence of the growing propaganda and influence activity of China's
United Front Work Department, the large role of Beijing's
state-controlled Confucius Institutes on foreign university campuses,
and the increasing penetration of paid-for pro-Chinese content such as
editorial partnerships or advertorials in respectable print outlets in
Europe and the United States.30 Authoritarian states in the Middle East
have used similar strategies, through overt channels like Qatar's Al
Jazeera and more clandestine means.31Smaller regimes typically have
fewer resources and narrower ambition, but can still have region-wide
impact: allies of Hungarian President Viktor Orbán have invested in
media outlets of nearby countries, like Slovenia, supporting like-minded
candidates there.32

The Disruption Challenge

Military threats, coercion and influence tend to be aimed at changing
behaviour in specific ways, often through particular policies. But
authoritarian states also target liberal democracies in a broader, less
purposeful way. **[Authoritarian powers seek to weaken democratic rivals
and alliances to undermine the ideological appeal of open
societies]{.underline}**, in turn consolidating their own power.

This interference occurs on a spectrum ranging from broad propaganda to
cyberattacks to full-blown political subversion.33 Russia's assault on
the 2016 US presidential election and support for extremist political
movements in Europe are the most egregious examples of this challenge.34
This approach was in keeping with Russia's long-standing practice of
active measures---the deliberate effort to widen cracks in an
adversary's society.35 The purpose of these interventions is not only to
elevate individual candidates or parties, or to bargain over a
particular policy, but also to sap confidence in the health of democracy
as a whole.

**[The Spread of Authoritarian Norms]{.underline}**

The competition between authoritarian states and liberal democracies
**[plays out not only through their direct interactions but also with
respect to wider international norms]{.underline}**.

This challenge to norms has two dimensions. One is negative, with
authoritarian states arguing that the political and economic
difficulties of the West, and the relatively slower growth of
non-Western democracies like India, demonstrate the failure of the
entire political model. They associate liberal democracy with
stagnation, unpredictability and even chaos.

Alongside this attempt to discredit liberal democracy is a parallel
effort to displace liberal norms---ones that hinder authoritarian
states' freedom of action, or even threaten their own legitimacy---with
alternative ones. **[As authoritarian states grow more powerful,
prosperous and confident, their principles are reflected in their
broader foreign policy]{.underline}**. These principles include
majoritarianism, absolute sovereignty, boundless executive power,
historical revisionism and personal rule.36 Authoritarian states become
more comfortable with supporting repressive regimes, even in periods of
intense violence, less willing to make cooperation conditional on human
rights and rule-of-law concerns, and more likely to export the
authoritarian behaviours and ideas they practise at home.

These norms can take hold across large areas. **[Authoritarian-led
regional blocs]{.underline}**, such as the Shanghai Cooperation
Organisation (SCO) or the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), **[create space
for illiberal cooperation]{.underline}**, for instance allowing the
extradition of suspects on political grounds that would never be
accepted in groupings such as the European Union (EU).37 The
Russian-dominated Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and the
Chinese-led SCO have both created spurious election-monitoring bodies
"that endorse fraudulent elections with the aim of clouding the
assessments made by established monitoring organizations"---a
quintessential example of authoritarian norm setting.38

**[Authoritarian norm setting can spread]{.underline}** through both
political and economic projects. China's Belt and Road Initiative, a
flagship set of infrastructure and connectivity projects stretching from
Asia to Europe, has empowered strongmen leaders, tilted the
civil-military balance in Pakistan away from civilians, saddled
low-capacity countries with unsustainable debt, favoured Chinese over
local firms or transparent international tendering and paved the way for
an expansion of China's military footprint into new areas.39 The scheme
has provoked a backlash from the US, Europe, India and Japan, among
others, not only because it embodies unfair economic practices, but also
because it squeezes liberal norms---such as transparency and
multilateralism---in key regions like the Indian Ocean.

Internationally, at the United Nations (UN), Russia and China have
systematically targeted human-rights advocacy by attempting to cut
spending for human-rights posts on UN peacekeeping missions, attacking a
human-rights cell in the office of the secretary general, and blocking a
UN human-rights commissioner from addressing the UN Security Council on
Syria.40 More broadly, authoritarian states export their norms not only
by selling or transferring individual tools of surveillance, such as
cameras and software, but also through entire systems of repression.41

Finally, **[authoritarian states offer the world an alternative
political model to liberal democracy]{.underline}**, capitalising on
what they portray as the congenital shortcomings of open societies. At
the 19th Party Congress of the Chinese Community Party, President Xi
Jinping notably presented China as "a new option for nations who want to
speed up their development while preserving their independence".42
China's model of authoritarian capitalism, contrasted to the low growth
and political instability of its Western competitors, makes it harder
for democracies to sell their norms to developing countries and can even
reinforce disillusionment in the West. Russia's model of personal rule,
ultranationalism and purported defence of traditional Western
civilisation appeals to would-be strongmen in Europe and beyond.43

The Cohesion Challenge

**[Democratic backsliding]{.underline}** in the democratic congregation,
or among its aspiring members, **[presents a]{.underline}** different
sort of **[challenge]{.underline}**. In recent years, Poland and Hungary
have exemplified this problem. Their **[governments have undermined the
rule of law, weakened the free press, removed checks and balances, and
vilified minorities]{.underline}**.44 Among countries queuing up to join
the EU, the trends are also worrying. In the Western Balkans, for
instance, media freedom and governance have both been eroding.45 This is
partly linked to the challenges described above, in the form of Russian
disruption, such as a Russian-backed coup attempt in Montenegro, and
influence operations, including the spread of Russian propaganda
channels.46

**[This political regression has three major consequences for liberal
democracies]{.underline}**. First, **[it undercuts the EU's
claim]{.underline}**---to its own citizens, to aspiring members and to
the wider world---**[to]{.underline}** embody liberal **[democratic
values]{.underline}**. Europe has less credibility in speaking to
backsliding states in Asia, Africa or South America when its own members
can violate core European values with impunity.

Second, democratic backsliders---particularly those of the
populist-nationalist variety---are more likely to advance a view of
international relations that prioritises competition and bargaining over
liberal solidarity. This cuts at the ideological heart of the European
project.

Third, **[illiberal-minded leaders]{.underline}** in Poland and Hungary,
as well as in Italy, Austria and even the United States, **[are more
likely to demonstrate affinity for authoritarian powers like
Russia]{.underline}**.47 **[This frustrates a common]{.underline}**
European and **[Western response]{.underline}**. Hungary, for instance,
was the lone abstention from a European rebuke of China's Belt and Road
Initiative in late 2017, and blocked a statement on China's conduct in
the South China Sea in 2016.48

Summarising the Challenge

What can we draw from this breakdown of the authoritarian challenge?

First, **[this is not just a story of Russia and China]{.underline}**.
While Russian revanchism and China's extraordinary economic ascendance
make them two of the most significant authoritarian powers, it would be
a mistake to consider the challenge in these narrow terms.
**[Authoritarian middle powers can exert a larger
influence]{.underline}** on their region than more distant great powers;
**[Turkey's impact on the Western Balkans, the Levant and the Persian
Gulf is in many respects larger than that of China]{.underline}**.49

Second, while it is useful to disaggregate these challenges, they can
also flow into one another. **[Influence operations that spread
propaganda and false claims can disrupt national politics, undermine
cohesion between allies and function as a coercive threat]{.underline}**
of more to come.
