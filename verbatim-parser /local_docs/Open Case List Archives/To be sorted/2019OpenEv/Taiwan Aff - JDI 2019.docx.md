report raises concerns over China attacking Taiwan", January 16, 2019,

WASHINGTON --- Amid increasing tensions with Beijing, [the Pentagon has
released a new report that lays out US **concern**s about China's
growing military might, underscoring worries about a possible **attack
against Taiwan**]{.underline}. Speaking to reporters, a senior defense
intelligence official said Tuesday that the key concern is that as
[China upgrades its military equipment and technology and reforms how it
trains and develops troops, it becomes more confident in its ability to
wage a regional conflict]{.underline}. And Beijing's leaders have made
it clear that reasserting sovereignty over Taiwan is a top priority. The
official added, however, that although China could easily fire missiles
at Taiwan, it doesn't yet have the military capability to successfully
invade the self-governing island, which split from mainland China amid
civil war in 1949. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in order
to provide more detail on intelligence findings in the report, which was
written by the Defense Intelligence Agency. A Chinese government
spokeswoman said the report "is full of Cold War ideology and zero-sum
game thinking" and [suggested the US was making excuses to strengthen or
develop its own weapons of mass destruction]{.underline}. "We use rules
rather than weapons to safeguard and promote our own interests," foreign
ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a daily news briefing in
Beijing on Wednesday. The report's release Tuesday comes just a week
after [Chinese President Xi Jinping called on his People's Liberation
Army to better prepare for combat. **China has warned the US** against
further upgrading military ties with Taiwan and has **threatened to use
force** against the island to assert its claim of
sovereignty]{.underline}. Under President Donald Trump, [the US has
taken incremental moves to bolster ties with the island, including
renewed arms sales and upgraded contacts between officials. US-China
tensions [have become **increasingly frayed** on the military and
economic
fronts](https://nypost.com/2018/12/04/trump-dubs-himself-tariff-man-threatens-tougher-stance-with-chinese/)
over the past year]{.underline}. Trump imposed tariff increases of up to
25 percent on \$250 billion of Chinese imports over complaints Beijing
steals or pressures companies to hand over technology. Xi responded by
imposing penalties on \$110 billion of American goods. And last year the
Pentagon disinvited China to a major, multinational Pacific exercise,
citing Beijing's militarization of man-made islands in the South China
Sea. [The ongoing rise of China, in fact, has **triggered greater US
military attention** on the Indo-Pacific region over the last several
years]{.underline}. And last year's release of the US National Defense
Strategy emphasized the importance of great power competition with
Russia and China. And it asserted that [China's rapidly expanding
military and Russia's **increasing aggression are threatening America's
military** advantage around the world]{.underline}. Just after taking
over as the acting defense secretary, [Pat Shanahan told his military
service leaders on Jan. 2 that their focus should be "China, China,
China]{.underline}." The DIA report talks broadly about the steps [China
is taking to **modernize its military** and expand its operations around
the globe]{.underline}. The worry, said the defense intelligence
official, is that China will reach the point where leaders will decide
that using military force for a regional conflict such as Taiwan is more
imminent. "[Beijing's longstanding interest to eventually compel
Taiwan's **reunification with the mainland** and deter any attempt by
Taiwan to **declare independence** has served as the primary driver for
China's **military modernization**]{.underline}," the report says.
"Beijing's anticipation that foreign forces would intervene in a Taiwan
scenario led the PLA to develop a range of systems to deter and deny
foreign regional force projection." Over time, the report said, [the PLA
is "likely to grow even more **technologically advanced**, with
equipment comparable to that of other modern militaries.]{.underline}"
That would include advanced fighter aircraft, ships, missile systems and
space and cyberspace capabilities. Cyberthreats from China have long
been a major US concern, stretching from massive data breaches and the
theft of trade secrets to Beijing's campaign to improve its ability to
conduct cyberattacks. [The US official said China has been working very
hard on developing ways to combine cyberattack capabilities with other
kinetic weapons that can be used in **combat**]{.underline}. Still, the
official said Beijing will face a significant challenge as it tries to
bring generational change to its military. Until now, China has mainly
done tightly controlled regional operations and some counterpiracy
missions. It will be more difficult, the official said, to create a
joint force capable of conducting large, complex combat operations far
abroad.

#### That exacerbates internal Taiwanese pressure to push for Independence 

#### This makes a Chinese invasion inevitable -- ending arms sales is key

**Gomez** 20**16**

(Eric, licy analyst for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato
Institute, "A Costly Commitment: Options for the Future of the
U.S.-Taiwan Defense Relationship", September 28, 2016, date accessed
6/25/19,
https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/costly-commitment-options-future-us-taiwan-defense-relationship#full)//CS

The final policy option would [do away with **America's commitment** to
Taiwan's defense on the grounds that military intervention to preserve
the island's de facto independence has become **too costly and
dangerous** for the United States. **Stepping down from the commitment**
to come to Taiwan's rescue would be a major change]{.underline} in U.S.
policy. However, other factors unrelated to the U.S. commitment would
still make the use of force unattractive for Beijing. Taiwan would
therefore not be defenseless or subject to imminent Chinese attack if
the United States chose this policy option. [Without a U.S. commitment,
Taiwan would have to improve its self-defense capability to deter an
attack by China and fight off the PLA if deterrence failed]{.underline}.
Taiwan does face an unfavorable balance of power vis-à-vis China, but
[this does not doom Taiwan to military defeat]{.underline}. In fact,
research by Ivan Arreguín-Toft of Boston University indicates that
large, powerful actors (such as China) have lost wars against weaker
actors "with increasing frequency over
time."[56](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/costly-commitment-options-future-us-taiwan-defense-relationship#cite-56)
However, in order to have the greatest chance of success, the weaker
side must have the right military strategy. [A head-on, symmetric fight
with the PLA would likely end in disaster for Taiwan, but Taiwan could
successfully deny the PLA from achieving its strategic objectives
through the same kind of asymmetric strategy that China uses to make it
difficult for the United States to defend
Taiwan.]{.underline}[57](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/costly-commitment-options-future-us-taiwan-defense-relationship#cite-57)
A military strategy emphasizing mobility, concealment, and area denial
would both raise the costs of war for China and be sustainable, given
Taiwan's limited means. [Changing Taiwan's defense strategy would not be
a quick or easy task]{.underline}. The most immediate roadblocks to
change are the equipment and mindset of Taiwan's military. The upper
echelons of the military have resisted implementing changes that could
improve their ability to fight a war against the modern PLA. For
example, James Holmes points out that Taiwan's navy "\[sees\] itself as
a U.S. Navy in miniature, a force destined to win decisive sea fights
and rule the
waves."[58](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/costly-commitment-options-future-us-taiwan-defense-relationship#cite-58)
This is a dangerous mindset given the PLA Navy's dominance in fleet
size, strength, and advanced equipment. The Taiwan Marine Corps (TMC) is
also ill-suited to meeting the threat posed by China. Instead of being a
light, agile force, the TMC is "heavy, mechanized, and not particularly
mobile," reflecting "a glaring failure by Taiwan's defense establishment
to recognize the TMC's essential role in national
defense."[59](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/costly-commitment-options-future-us-taiwan-defense-relationship#cite-59)
[Overcoming the forces of bureaucratic inertia will be very difficult,
but doing so is necessary if **Taiwan can no longer count on the United
States**. Stepping down from the U.S. defense commitment would likely
involve reductions in U.S. arms sales. Reductions in the size, quantity,
and frequency of arms sales would likely precede any reductions to the
defense commitment because arms sales are a measurable signal of
American support for Taiwan.]{.underline} Lyle J. Goldstein of the U.S.
Naval War College points out, "[Arms sales have for some time taken on a
**purely symbolic
meaning**]{.underline}."[60](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/costly-commitment-options-future-us-taiwan-defense-relationship#cite-60)
This implies that [the negative effects of reducing arms sales would be
relatively small]{.underline}, since China's extant military advantages
are not being offset by U.S. weaponry. Additionally, stopping the arms
sales would not have to be instantaneous. The United States could reduce
arms sales incrementally to give Taiwan time to improve its self-defense
capabilities. [One common argument made by opponents of stepping down
from the commitment is that it is the only thing preventing China from
attacking Taiwan]{.underline}. This argument ignores several important
factors that make the use of force unattractive for Beijing. First,
[China's reputation and standing in East Asia would be seriously
damaged]{.underline}. Other countries in East Asia would harshly
criticize China's use of force, and would likely take steps to defend
themselves. For example, countries involved in territorial disputes with
Beijing in the South China Sea have responded to Chinese aggressiveness
by improving their military power and pushing back politically and
diplomatically.[61](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/costly-commitment-options-future-us-taiwan-defense-relationship#cite-61)
China's reputational costs for attacking Taiwan would be very high.
Additionally, any military operation against Taiwan would tie up a great
deal of resources. Other states could take advantage of a Taiwan-focused
Beijing to push back against other Chinese territorial claims. Second,
the PLA has problems with both "hardware" (equipment) and "software"
(experience) that would restrict its options for using military force
against
Taiwan.[62](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/costly-commitment-options-future-us-taiwan-defense-relationship#cite-62)
The modern PLA has no experience conducting large-scale amphibious
landings, which are complicated operations that would be very costly to
execute against a dug-in
defender.[63](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/costly-commitment-options-future-us-taiwan-defense-relationship#cite-63)
On the hardware side, the PLA still lacks the amphibious-lift
capabilities and replenishment ships necessary to mount a successful
invasion
attempt.[64](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/costly-commitment-options-future-us-taiwan-defense-relationship#cite-64)
China has made big strides shifting the relative balance of power in the
Taiwan Strait, but it still faces significant challenges that will take
time to
overcome.[65](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/costly-commitment-options-future-us-taiwan-defense-relationship#cite-65)
Presently, [the PLA is **more prepared to push back against American
intervention** than to initiate an invasion of Taiwan.]{.underline} How
the United States goes about stepping down from its commitment is
important. Suddenly abrogating the TRA would be practically impossible
given the entrenched support for Taiwan within Congress. [The most
realistic, feasible approach requires]{.underline} incremental
[**reductions** in U.S. support for Taiwan]{.underline}. Examples of
such reductions could include setting a cap on the value and/or quality
of military equipment that can be sold to Taiwan, changing the TRA to
more narrowly define what constitutes a threat to Taiwan, or requiring
Taiwan to spend a certain percentage of its GDP on defense in order to
receive U.S. military support. Incremental reduction would be easier to
sell to U.S. policymakers because it buys time for Taiwan to improve its
defenses, thus increasing the credibility of the island's military
deterrent. As discussed earlier, Taiwan's defense industries have proven
they can make high-quality military equipment that meets the island's
defense needs. Taiwan has the ability to develop a robust and effective
military deterrent, but it needs time to overcome existing challenges
and address unforeseen obstacles. If the United States were to reduce
its commitment incrementally, Taiwan's political and military leadership
would have the time to address such challenges. Incremental
[implementation of this policy option would also provide the United
States with opportunities to learn about Chinese intentions, based on
Beijing's
reaction]{.underline}.[66](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/costly-commitment-options-future-us-taiwan-defense-relationship#cite-66)
Stepping down from the defense commitment to Taiwan would be a major
accommodation on a core Chinese security interest. American policymakers
should demand some sort of reciprocal actions from Beijing that reduce
the military threat the PLA poses to Taiwan. In Meeting China Halfway,
Lyle J. Goldstein explains how "[**cooperation spirals**" in the
U.S.-China relationship can build "**trust and confidence** ... over
time through incremental and reciprocal steps that gradually lead to
larger and more significant
compromises]{.underline}."[67](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/costly-commitment-options-future-us-taiwan-defense-relationship#cite-67)
However, if Washington takes accommodating policy positions and Beijing
responds with obstinacy or increased aggression, then American
policymakers would likely want to adjust their approach. [Stepping down
from the U.S. defense commitment to Taiwan]{.underline}, regardless of
how it is implemented, [is a controversial policy option]{.underline}
that would face significant opposition. [However, there is a strong case
to be made for the benefits of such a policy. Taiwan's fate carries much
more significance for China than the United States, and American
military superiority over China is eroding]{.underline}. Although Taiwan
faces serious challenges, it would be capable of maintaining a military
deterrent without American support, especially given the other factors
that rein in Chinese aggression. A self-defense strategy emphasizing
asymmetric warfare could raise the costs of military conflict for China
to unacceptably high levels. Most important, [the risk of armed conflict
between the United States and China would be **significantly
reduced**]{.underline}.

[Shifts in U.S. policy]{.underline} [that encourage Taiwan to believe
that the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates will [support its
moves toward independence **increase the probability of
war**]{.underline}. For example, the United States could change Taiwan's
expectations by revising the conditions under which it will come to
Taiwan's aid. The United States currently tries to constrain Taiwan by
making its defense commitment conditional --- the United States will
respond only to unprovoked Chinese attacks; that is, it will not come to
Taiwan's defense if a Chinese attack is provoked by Taiwan's declaration
of independence. Eliminating or blurring this conditionality could
embolden Taiwan. A variety of dangers could follow. [If Taiwan declares
independence, war between China and Taiwan is the likely
outcome]{.underline}. [Even moving too far in that direction could fuel
a major crisis]{.underline}. And [if the United States actually would
come to Taiwan's defense, then conventional war between China and the
United States also becomes more likely]{.underline}. **[Conventional war
between two nuclear powers increases the probability of nuclear
war]{.underline}**. Other paths to conflict could also result. [In
response to a new]{.underline}ly provocative [policy toward
Taiwan]{.underline}, [China might adopt still more assertive policies in
the South China and East China Seas]{.underline}. The
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates could then [get drawn into
conflict to protect]{.underline} a friend or [ally]{.underline}.
[China]{.underline} might [accelerate its buildup of conventional forces
to further improve its ability to coerce Taiwan]{.underline}, [which
would intensify military competition with the United States and strain
political relations.]{.underline} If any change is in order[, the United
States should be moving in the opposite direction --- reducing its
commitment to Taiwan to improve U.S. relations with China.]{.underline}
I have argued elsewhere that the United States should pursue a grand
bargain with China: China would resolve its maritime disputes and
officially accept the United States' military presence and alliance
commitments in East Asia; in turn, the United States would end its
commitment to Taiwan. Although costly, among other reasons because
Taiwan is a democracy, accommodation could increase U.S. security. But
China's growing assertiveness, especially in the South China Sea, has
cast doubt on the wisdom of such a bargain --- accommodating an
expansionist state can be self-defeating. Down the road, the prospects
for bargained mutual accommodation may be better. For the time being,
careful maintenance of the long-standing United States policy toward
Taiwan is the best path forward.

Trump's administration rolled out a long-awaited overhaul of U.S. arms
export policy in 2018 aimed at expanding sales to allies, saying it
would bolster the American defense industry and create jobs at home.
Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro was one of the administration's
architects of that policy. Navarro, a China hawk, wrote about the

because of international orders. The Pentagon announced last week it
would sell 34 ScanEagle drones, made by Boeing Co, to the governments of
Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam for \$47 million. The
drones would afford greater intelligence-gathering capabilities,

one of [the largest]{.underline} to Taiwan [in recent years]{.underline}
by the United States. The single costliest [part of the package
is]{.underline} 108 M1A2 [Abrams tanks]{.underline}, the officials said,
[and]{.underline} the deal would also resupply some weapons, including
[portable anti-tank missile systems]{.underline}. The United States does
not give national recognition to Taiwan, a de facto independent island
off the southeast coast of China that the Chinese Communist Party
intends to bring back eventually under the control of Beijing, by force
if necessary. But [the [Taiwan Relations
Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/96th-congress/house-bill/2479)
obligates the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates government [to
help Taiwan maintain self-defense capabilities, and each administration
has sold it arms packages]{.underline}. The United States is Taiwan's
main arms supplier. [The Taiwan defense ministry requested the weapons
in the [latest
package](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-taiwan-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-preparing-to-sell-over-2-billion-in-weapons-to-taiwan-testing-china-sources-idUSKCN1T62CA)]{.underline},
which was first reported by Reuters on Wednesday. Congress would have to
be notified of the deal before it could go forward. Trump administration
[officials have become increasingly worried about the intentions of
Chinese leaders toward Taiwan]{.underline}, and [they]{.underline} also
[regard Taiwan as an important counterweight to China in the
region]{.underline}. Though China's military capabilities still lag far
behind those of the United States, the People's Liberation Army has
worked on weapons systems, including anti-ship ballistic missiles, that
might prove effective against the United States Navy in the event of
conflict in the Taiwan Strait. In recent months, the Pentagon has
ordered naval ships to sail through the Taiwan Strait with increasing
frequency, in shows of strength that officials call freedom of
navigation exercises. [The proposed purchase of tanks and missiles is
consistent with Taiwan's deterrence strategy,]{.underline} said Bonnie
S. Glaser, a senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies. "[They would help prevent an
invasion]{.underline}, making it difficult for an invading P.L.A. force
to establish a beachhead in northern Taiwan," she said, referring to the
People's Liberation Army. "I expect the Trump administration to approve
this package, as part of a policy of bolstering Taiwan's defenses."

Wang Kung-yi, a political science professor at the Chinese Culture
University in Taipei, said the [US-Taiwan Business Council]{.underline}
appeared to [want to play down the significance of the planned event in
Taiwan]{.underline}, probably [due to concerns about antagonizing
China's government]{.underline}. [Beijing]{.underline}, which considers
Taiwan a breakaway Chinese province, [has repeatedly warned the US and
other countries against helping the island to arm itself.]{.underline}
"[The]{.underline} Taiwan [seminar]{.underline} is significant in the
sense that it [will]{.underline} not only [facilitate exchanges between
prominent US arms suppliers and local manufacturers]{.underline} but
will [also]{.underline} serve as another important channel for officials
from the two sides to [discuss the kinds of weapons Taiwan should buy or
build to try to counter the military balance now heavily tilting towards
China]{.underline}," he said. It is not known whether the US will send
senior defense or State Department officials to attend the Taiwan event,
as it has done at previous meetings in the US, but prominent US arms
suppliers, including Raytheon and Lockheed Martin, are expected to send
representatives to Taiwan, according to Wang. Representatives of
Raytheon, Lockheed Martin and 10 other US arms suppliers joined a
delegation organized by the US-Taiwan Business Council to visit Taiwan
last month and met with President Tsai Ing-wen of the
independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party. [Senior military
officials and expert]{.underline}s, including those from Taiwan's
Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology, [are also expected to
attend the planned seminar]{.underline}, as they have at previous
conferences held in the US.

### Ending Arms Sales Key to Peaceful Transition

#### US Arm Sales to Taiwan prevents peaceful negotiations 

J. Michael **Cole**, 04/01/**11**, staff reporter at the Taipei Times,
"US arms sales creating 'vicious circle'", Taipei Times, 06/24/19,
http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2011/04/01/2003499637/1,
NN)

A report co-authored by a former commander-in-chief of the US Pacific
Command is calling on Washington to re-examine its relationship with
Taiwan, especially on what it calls the "vicious circle" of arms sales.
The product of a three-day roundtable at the University of Virginia's
Miller Center for Public Affairs in January, A Way Ahead with China:
Steering the right course with the Middle Kingdom explores how the US
could improve relations with China and portrays Taiwan as the principal
irritant in the evolving bilateral relationship. "Today, [[the changing
and evolving US/China relationship demands a practical
strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}," the introductory letter by center
director Gerald Baliles says. "There must be careful consideration of
what both nations seek to gain from this relationship, and of how the
relationship itself affects the balance of nations worldwide." [[Part of
that practical strategy]{.mark}, the report says, [involves rethinking
longstanding US security commitments to Taiwan under the Taiwan
Relations Act]{.mark}.]{.underline} "[The United States takes a somewhat
protectionist stance with Taiwan historically]{.underline}," the report
says. "However, Taiwan is now an economically successful democratic
institution that is slowly tending towards greater alignment with the
Mainland \[China\]. [[Our involvement with Taiwan is a frequent point of
contention with the Chinese, particularly in respect to arms
sales]{.mark}, and one that should be re-examined]{.underline}. [[The
complex relationship is political and should be re-examined outside of a
military context]{.underline}]{.mark}." Among the authors of the report
are former commander-in-chief of the US Pacific Command Admiral Joseph
Prueher, former ambassador to the People's Republic of China under
former US presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and former
commander-in-chief of the US Pacific Command Admiral Timothy Keating, as
well as James Shinn, National Intelligence Officer for East Asia at the
CIA. Two specialists on China, Charles Freeman of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies and David Lampton of Johns Hopkins
University, also took part, as did representatives from FedEx Express.
[In its recommendations, the report says [Washington and Beijing should
engage in what it calls "protracted negotiation," which involves
understanding each party's respective "want-to-haves" and
"need-to-haves." One of Beijing's "want-to-haves" is -unification with
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}. "[A peaceful resolution of the long
standing \[sic\] Taiwan issue, acceptable on both sides of the strait
\[,\] would indeed be a boon to stability in East Asia, as well as to
US/China relations. It is also an issue where progress can be
made]{.underline}," the report said. ["[Unfortunately, US arms sales to
Taiwan are part of a vicious circle, leading to the Taiwan issue that is
clearly political, and increasingly economic, being always discussed in
military terms]{.mark}]{.underline}," the report said. As the "Taiwan
issue" is not a military one, the report says, [[talks should be
"elevated from a mostly military to a politico-economic dialogue"
addressing the economy, politics and culture. Standing in the way of
that resolution, however, are the political considerations associated
with arms sales, which the report says are compelling all three
governments to make counterproductive policy
decisions]{.underline}]{.mark}. "Politically, the president of the
Taiwan people, now the extremely capable Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九), in order
to get elected, must satisfy a large segment of his Taiwanese
constituency by asking the US to approve annual arm sales to Taiwan," it
says, while "the US Administration, for domestic political reasons, must
offer arms to Taiwan ... \[and\] Mainland Chinese \[PRC\] leaders, to
reconcile increasingly pluralistic domestic pressures, are obliged to
protest the interferences of these arms sales in 'internal Chinese
affairs.'"

## Independence Movements

### Independence Movements Growing -- Tsai

#### Taiwan's actively seeking to be recognized as independent -- Tsai is rejecting 1992 consensus, shifting her tone to China, and seeking international support

Defying Xi Jinping Calls Unification Order 'Impossible'"*,* January 5,

TAIPEI, Taiwan --- [President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan called on Saturday
for domestic and international support of the island's de facto
independence, days after]{.underline} China's leader, [Xi Jinping,
warned that unification with China was inevitable]{.underline}. "It is
impossible for me or, in my view, any responsible politician in Taiwan
to accept President Xi Jinping's recent remarks without betraying the
trust and the will of the people of Taiwan," Ms. Tsai said in a briefing
for foreign reporters in Taipei, Taiwan's capital. "[We hope the
international community will pay attention and combine efforts to speak
out on our behalf,"]{.underline} she said. [Mr. Xi's
speech](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/world/asia/xi-jinping-taiwan-china.html?module=inline),
his first major address on Taiwan, has given [Ms. Tsai a chance to
position herself as the young democracy's defender, both to the outside
world and to voters who will decide next year whether she stays in
office. Her party was [battered in local
elections](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/world/asia/taiwan-election-results.html?module=inline) in
November, but since Mr. Xi's address there has been a groundswell of
support for her on Taiwan social media]{.underline} and even, to some
degree, in publications that tend to oppose her. [Tensions between
Taiwan and Beijing, which claims the self-governing island as part of
Chinese territory, have emerged as one of the region's flash points. Mr.
Xi, the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao, reiterated in his speech
that Beijing would use force if necessary to prevent Taiwan from seeking
formal independence. Mr. Xi has been ramping up [pressure on Ms. Tsai's
administration](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/25/world/asia/china-taiwan-identity-xi-jinping.html?action=click&module=inline&pgtype=Article&region=Footer)
over her refusal to accept the so-called 1992 consensus]{.underline} ---
a vague notion, accepted by Ms. Tsai's predecessor, tha[t posits that
Taiwan and China are part of the same country, with each side allowed
its own interpretation of what that China is. In his speech, Mr. Xi
urged Taiwan to avoid a "dead end" and accept his offer of the "one
country, two systems" framework]{.underline} under which Hong Kong has
operated since Britain returned it to Chinese rule in 1997. But many
people in Hong Kong and elsewhere --- not least in Taiwan, where the
situation is closely watched --- believe that [Hong Kong's promised
freedoms have been
eroding](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/world/asia/victor-mallet-hong-kong-financial-times.html?module=inline) under
Mr. Xi's rule."I myself expect all of Taiwan's political parties to
clearly state, '[We reject "one country, two systems,'" Ms. Tsai said on
Saturday. "And there's no need to talk about the 1992 consensus anymore,
because this term has already been defined by Beijing as 'one country,
two systems.'" Analysts said that Ms. Tsai, both on Saturday and in a
speech on Wednesday responding to Mr. Xi, had taken an unusually firm,
unequivocal posture, marking a shift away from the cautious ambiguity
she had previously deployed, apparently in hopes of avoiding unnecessary
provocations.]{.underline} "[There is no doubt that Tsai has changed her
tone,"]{.underline} said Austin Wang, an assistant professor of
political science at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who studies
Taiwan. "Tsai made a huge shift from not publicly accepting the 1992
consensus to directly rejecting it. "Taiwan's opposition [Kuomintang
party, which once ruled China, moved its government to the island in
1949, having lost the civil war to Mao's Communists]{.underline}. Taiwan
is still formally known as the Republic of China, the name under which
the Kuomintang governed the mainland. The Kuomintang said Thursday that
it was opposed to Taiwan independence --- a phrase it takes to mean the
removal of vestiges of the Republic of China in favor of a Republic of
Taiwan. [But even the Kuomintang, which favors closer relations with
Beijing than does Ms. Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party, said after
Mr. Xi's speech that a Hong Kong-style arrangement would not be
supported by most Taiwanese]{.underline}. An opinion article published
on Saturday in the United Daily News, a Kuomintang-friendly news outlet,
said that Ms. [Tsai's response to Mr. Xi this past week, including
several posts on [her Facebook
page](https://www.facebook.com/tsaiingwen/photos/a.10151242056081065/10155578072051065/?type=3&theater),
had reversed her fortunes with much of the public. [An
essay](https://solidaritytw.tumblr.com/post/181726959356/viral-response-to-tsai-speech-by-sxtbit)
that has circulated widely on Taiwanese social media portrays Ms. Tsai
as a mother vowing to defend her child from a bully.]{.underline}

### Independence Movements Growing -- Public Support

#### Taiwanese support for independence

rejects 'one-China principle\' as support for independence rises: poll",
article "Taiwan News", \[6/27/2019\]
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3622244

The Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation (TPOF, 台灣民意基金會) released
the results of their newest survey today, revealing that only [25
percent of the Taiwanese public support]{.underline} the idea of "[one
country two systems]{.underline}," [and 68 percent do not agree
with]{.underline} China's "[one-China]{.underline} principle." The poll
also revealed that [47.5 percent expect]{.underline} some kind of
[Taiwanese independence]{.underline} to take place in the future. [The
results show a 12 percent increase in support for]{.underline} Taiwanese
[independence]{.underline} when compared to last month's results. TPOF
suggested that recent threats by Chinese leader Xi Jinping (習近平) had
encouraged people who previously supported the status quo to move
towards supporting Taiwanese independence. On Jan. 2, Xi threatened
Taiwan to accept unification, and reserved the right to use force to
this end. In response, [Taiwan President]{.underline} Tsai Ing-wen
(蔡英文) [said]{.underline} that "[Taiwan will never accept a 'one
country, two systems' framework]{.underline}," [and called on the
international community to support its democracy against Chinese
threats.]{.underline} The survey also showed that 68 percent of
respondents do not agree that China and Taiwan belong to "the same
China." TPOF suggested that as the survey showed 47.5 percent expect
Taiwan independence to take place in the future and only 22.7 percent
expect unification, [the idea]{.underline} that [the Taiwanese people
want]{.underline} to maintain [the status quo]{.underline} indefinitely
[is a myth]{.underline}.

bloody, logistical nightmare", June 24, 2019, date accessed 6/26/2019,

Taiwan (CNN)Roaring out of the sky, an F-16V fighter jet lands smoothly
to rearm and refuel on an unremarkable freeway in rural Taiwan,
surrounded by rice paddies. In different circumstances, this could be
alarming sight. Taiwan\'s fighter pilots are trained to land on freeways
between sorties in case all of the island\'s airports have been occupied
or destroyed by an invasion. Luckily, this was a training exercise.
[There\'s only really one enemy that Taiwan\'s armed forces are
preparing to resist \-- China\'s People\'s Liberation Army]{.underline}
(PLA). And as [China\'s reputation as an **economic and military
superpowe**r has grown in recent years, so too has that **threat of
invasion**, according to security experts]{.underline}. Taiwan has been
[self-governed](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/28/asia/taiwan-us-china-bolton-intl/index.html)
since separating from China at the end of a brutal civil war in 1949,
but [Beijing has never given up hope of reuniting with what it considers
a renegade province]{.underline}. At a regional security conference in
June, Chinese [Defense Minister Wei Fenghe
said:](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-06/02/c_138110665.htm?mc_cid=cf6454682b&mc_eid=a324da7757)
\"[If anyone dares to split Taiwan from China, the Chinese military has
no choice but to **fight at all costs for national unity**.\" In some
shops in mainland China, you can buy postcards and T-shirts emblazoned
with patriotic emblems promoting the retaking of Taiwan]{.underline}.
But for seven decades, [China has resisted attacking Taiwan partly for
political reasons, including the **prospect of a US intervention** and
the potential heavy human toll. But the practical realities of a
**full-blown invasion** are also daunting for the PLA]{.underline},
according to experts. Ferrying hundreds of thousands of troops across
the narrow Taiwan Strait to a handful of reliable landing beaches, in
the face of fierce resistance, is a harrowing prospect. Troops would
then have a long slog over Taiwan\'s western mudflats and mountains to
reach the capital, Taipei. Not only that, [but China would face an
opponent who has been preparing for war for almost 70
years]{.underline}. At mass anti-invasion drills in May, Taiwan military
spokesman Maj. Gen. Chen Chung-Chi said the island knew it had to always
be \"combat-ready.\" \"Of course, we don\'t want war, but only by
gaining our own strength can we defend ourselves,\" he said. \"[If China
wants to take any action against us, it has to consider paying a
**painful price**.\" **Difficult and bloody** It could be easy to assume
that any invasion of Taiwan by Beijing would be brief and devastating
for Taipei]{.underline}: a David and Goliath fight between a tiny island
and the mainland\'s military might, population and wealth. With nearly
[1.4
billion](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html)
people, the People\'s Republic of China has the largest population in
the world. Taiwan has fewer than 24 million people \-- a similar number
to Australia. [China has the fifth largest territory in the
world]{.underline}, while Taiwan is the size of Denmark or the US state
of Maryland. And Beijing runs an economy that is second only to the
United States, while Taiwan\'s doesn\'t rank in the world\'s top 20. But
perhaps most pertinently, C[hina has been [building and modernizing its
military](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/04/asia/china-military-xi-jinping-intl/index.html)
at an unprecedented rate,]{.underline} while Taiwan relies on moderate
US arms sales. In sheer size, [the PLA simply dwarfs Taiwan\'s
military]{.underline}. China has an estimated 1 million troops, almost
6,000 tanks, 1,500 fighter jets and 33 navy destroyers, according to the
latest [US Defense Department
report.](https://media.defense.gov/2019/May/02/2002127082/-1/-1/1/2019_CHINA_MILITARY_POWER_REPORT.pdf)
Taiwan\'s ground force troops barely number 150,000 and are backed by
800 tanks and about 350 fighter aircraft, the report found, while its
navy fields only four destroyer-class ships. Under Chinese President Xi
Jinping, [the PLA has rapidly
modernized](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/04/asia/china-military-xi-jinping-intl/index.html),
buoyed by rises in military spending and crackdowns on corruption in the
army\'s leadership. \"China\'s leaders hope that [possessing these
military capabilities will deter pro-independence moves by Taiwan or,
should deterrence fail, will permit a range of tailored military options
against Taiwan and potential **third-party military
intervention**]{.underline},\" according to a 2019 [US Defense
Intelligence Agency
report](https://www.dia.mil/Portals/27/Documents/News/Military%20Power%20Publications/China_Military_Power_FINAL_5MB_20190103.pdf)
on China\'s military. Yet while China hawks in the media might beat the
drum of invasion, an internal China military study, seen by CNN,
revealed that the PLA considers an invasion of Taiwan to be extremely
difficult. \"[Taiwan has a professional military, with a **strong core
of American**-trained experts]{.underline},\" said Ian Easton, author of
\"The Chinese Invasion Threat\" and research fellow at the Project 2049
Institute, as well as \"highly defensible\" terrain. In his book he
described [an invasion by China as \"the **most difficult and bloody**
mission facing the Chinese military]{.underline}.\"

### Taiwan Strait Conflict Escalates

#### US arms sales to Taiwan escalates the Taiwan strait with China 

**Li Xia 4-17-19** (Li Xia is a writer and editor for Xinhua.com, "U.S.
arms sales to Taiwan a dangerous move to aggravate cross-Strait
situation", April 17^th^ 2019, accessed:6-24-18,
http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-04/17/c_137985601.htm)

The [[U.S. arms sale]{.underline}]{.mark} plan unveiled Monday is a
dangerous move that [[will only aggravate]{.underline}]{.mark} the
already complex and grim situation across [[the Taiwan
Strait]{.underline}]{.mark}. The U.S. government has approved a possible
500-million-U.S. dollar military sale to Taiwan, claiming that the move
will help to improve the security and defensive capability of the
recipient. Subsequently, Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen expressed
\"gratitude,\" saying that the arms sale was \"timely.\" The situation
across [[the Taiwan Strait]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is already
complicated and grim, [[is worsening]{.mark}]{.underline} as [[the
United States has been using Taiwan to contain
China]{.underline}]{.mark} [while the Taiwan administration kept seeking
foreign intervention.]{.underline} The Taiwan question [[concerns
China\'s sovereignty and territorial integrity and is the most important
and sensitive issue in China-U.S. relations.]{.mark}]{.underline} The
U.S. arms [[sales to Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark} constitutes [[a serious
violation of international law]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the basic norms
governing international relations, the one-China principle and the three
Sino-U.S. joint communiques and undermine China\'s sovereignty and
security interests.]{.underline} China\'s firm opposition to such arms
sales is consistent and firm. Since the current [[U.S.
administration]{.underline}]{.mark} took office, it has constantly
[[played the \"Taiwan card\" to contain China]{.underline}]{.mark},
especially in arms sales to Taiwan and military exchanges between the
United States and Taiwan. This has [[seriously damaged China-U.S.
relations]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and jeopardized peace and
stability]{.underline}]{.mark} across the Taiwan Strait. The Taiwan
question, which concerns China\'s core interests and the national bond
of the Chinese people, brooks no external interference. The U.S.
administration has once again stirred up sensitive nerves in the Taiwan
Strait. [Its gross interference in China\'s internal affairs has aroused
the strong indignation of the Chinese people on both sides of the
Strait.]{.underline} Some Taiwan organizations and people protested
outside the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) in Taipei, condemning
U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and demanding \"no war, only peace,\" and
\"[Taiwan is not a pawn for the United States.]{.underline}\" Therefore,
we would like to advise the [U.S. side to clearly recognize the high
sensitivity and serious harm of arms sales to Taiwan, correct mistakes,
honor its commitments and handle Taiwan-related issues in a prudent and
proper manner in accordance with the one-China principle and the
provisions of the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques.]{.underline}
[Taiwan\'s]{.underline} current Democratic Progressive Party
([DPP]{.underline}) administration, which [is teetering on the brink of
collapse]{.underline}, was overjoyed at the U.S. arms sales as if it had
been given a \"straw to save its life.\" Tsai Ing-wen and the [[DPP
administration have escalated provocations against the Chinese
mainland]{.underline}]{.mark}, created disturbances recently and
cooperated with the United States in vigorously clamoring the so-called
\"military threat\" from the mainland. In the face of next year\'s
general election on the island, [Tsai and the DPP will not hesitate to
let Taiwan serve as a pawn for forces of external interference in order
to protect their power, regardless of the safety and well-being of the
Taiwanese people.]{.underline} This party has not only misjudged the
situation but also deviated from the people\'s heart. [[U.S. weapons
cannot guarantee Taiwan\'s security]{.underline}]{.mark}. Tsai and the
DPP cannot secure their power and position by seeking foreign
interference or threatening the people.Tsai, the DPP and \"Taiwan
independence\" separatist elements should not play with fire or even
think about it. They are doomed to be alone in the face of the pressure
of their own actions. On April 17, 124 years ago, the Treaty of
Shimonoseki was signed, securing foreigner\'s occupation of Taiwan for
half a century. It left lasting, painful memories for all Chinese.
Today\'s [China will never allow the historical tragedy of national
division to repeat itself]{.underline}. No one and [[no force should
underestimate the determination and capability of the Chinese in
safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial
integrity.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Playing the Taiwan card could be dangerous for future U.S.-China
relations. [The Trump administration is caught up in a position between
the mainstream approach and the ultra-right nationalist approach in
dealing with China. The mainstream approach supports a cooperative and
stable bilateral relationship with China, a position close in what Xi
Jinping proposed a few years ago "a new model of major power
relations]{.underline}." In opposite, [the ultra-right nationalists in
the Trump administration want to have a harder-edged policy toward
China.]{.underline} They want Trump to adopt a tough stance on all
bilateral, global, and regional issues concerning China. [In their
views, China is an aggressive strategic competitor that needs to be
deterred with U.S. strength. The United States needs to deploy missile
defense close to Chinese borders and consolidate the American alliance
surrounding China.]{.underline} If this policy is adopted, Trump could
play the Taiwan card in a fashion like what the United States did in the
early Cold War years, treating Taiwan as an "unsinkable aircraft
carrier[." In order to deter Beijing from taking any actions that are
harmful to Taiwan's interest, Washington might help Taiwan build up
military strength against Beijing and expand its international space in
the world.]{.underline} In so doing, Washington will "rediscover" the
strategic value of Taiwan as a card of balancing against China. [If this
happens, the Taiwan Strait would be back to the center of a regional
power struggle and flash point of regional conflict. That would
certainly drive the U.S.-China relationship into new
confrontation.]{.underline}

[On March 31st, two PLA aircraft flew for about ten minutes on the
Taiwan side of the so-called median line that runs up and down the
Taiwan Strait. They **penetrated as much as 43 nautical miles** across
the line. Taiwan air force planes scrambled to monitor the PLA planes.
This was the first time in twenty years that there had been a
provocation of this sort by China, and it caused many people to **worry
about heightened tensions or even conflict.** I actually believe that
the purpose of this action was to send a political signal to the United
States and Taiwan to express displeasure at a variety of recent
developments between them that suggested closer cooperation. But this
does raise the broader question of just how dangerous the interaction
amongst Beijing, Taipei, and Washington is.]{.underline} Here, in
conclusion, are my best estimates: [First, absent from a clear and
strong provocation by Taiwan, such as **a declaration of independence**,
China will not initiate a full scale military campaign against campaign
to achieve unification. It has other ways of pursuing its goals, and it
believes that over time it will become more powerful. Also, the two
sides have been careful in managing their interactions over the Taiwan
Strait]{.underline}. But [if Beijing were to continue to engage in
provocative actions **as it did two weeks ago, it raises the possibility
of an accidental clash** that could then escalate into a broader
conflict.]{.underline} Second, the chances that Taiwan will declare
independence explicitly are close to zero. The population is opposed to
that and is unlikely to elect a leader who might try it. However, if a
pro-independence president were elected, [Beijing might interpret his or
her actions as covert moves towards independence and feel it has to take
some sort of action. **Miscalculation could be a problem.**]{.underline}
Third, one [danger for Taiwan is that Beijing will decide to expand its
intimidation campaign -- militarily, politically, economically, and
diplomatically -- and then **give Taiwan an ultimatum that it is time
for Taiwan to capitulate.**]{.underline} A key variable here is the
strength and unity of Taiwan's society, and I worry about [the
polarization of Taiwan's politics and the inability of the political
system to even try to reach a consensus on key issues, particularly on
the China issue.]{.underline} For Taiwan, [although the United States
has provided strong support over the years, and although the implicit
U.S. commitment to come to Taiwan's defense has helped keep the peace,
there are a couple of dangers that come with that support.]{.underline}
The first is that [Taiwan will get entrapped in a larger strategic
rivalry between China and the United States.]{.underline} The second is
that an American president who believes that protecting Taiwan is not in
the national interest of the United States will signal abandonment of
Taiwan, which would weaken deterrence. In [thinking about the
China-Taiwan dispute, from which we cannot exclude the possibility of
war, there is a question that should be asked but never is. That is, why
does China continue to insist that its unification formula -- one
country, two systems -- is the only one available for resolving its
fundamental dispute? Moreover, why should Beijing be allowed to define
the terms of the debate?]{.underline} One country, two systems was
formulated almost forty years ago in very different circumstances. It
was a formula that may have been appropriate for those times. But a lot
has changed since then. The world has changed. China has changed. And,
most importantly, Taiwan has changed. It became a democracy in which the
people have made it very clear that unification on China's terms is
totally unacceptable. Perhaps, in order to reduce the danger of the
current situation, it's time for China to change the terms on which to
discuss a political solution to its Taiwan problem.

**Williams 19**

(Williams, Trevor is the managing editor of Global Atlanta. "Chinese
Ambassador: Stability of U.S.-China Relations Hinges on Taiwan Issue,"
Global Atlanta, 1/18/19. D.A. 6/25/19.

[How well the U.S. and China can work together into the future will
depend largely on American posture toward the most crucial of China's
long-standing political concerns: Taiwan, the Chinese ambassador to the
U.S. said in Atlanta Friday. Taiwan is still the "**most important and
sensitive issue**" in a globally vital relationship that derives its
political foundation from the U.S.'s one-China policy, Cui Tiankai said
during a wide-ranging speech at the Carter Center.]{.underline} China
still considers Taiwan, a self-ruled island with a democratically
elected president and legislature, as a wayward province. The two sides
split in 1949 after a civil war. [Since early 2017, the **Trump
administration has rankled China** with a range of actions perceived as
upsetting the status quo. Shortly after his inauguration, President
Trump famously broke precedent by taking a call from Taiwanese President
Tsai Ing-wen, then questioned whether the U.S. would remain committed to
the one-China policy. He has gone on to complete arms sales to Taiwan,
allowed opening of a \$200 million de facto embassy in Taipei and signed
a law making it easier for Taiwanese government officials to travel to
the U.S.]{.underline} Mr. Cui suggested that [progress on talks to
de-escalate the ongoing U.S.-China trade war **could be threatened by
further moves in support of Taiwan.**]{.underline} On New Year's Day,
Chinese [President Xi Jinping made a widely publicized speech on Taiwan,
reiterating the long-held Chinese goal of reuniting with the island,
**by force if necessary**]{.underline}, though he set no timeline for
action. Mr. Xi's message was intended to convey "China's determination
to achieve national reunification and the opposition to any external
interference," Mr. Cui said at the Carter Center. "[Future stability of
China-U.S. relations will no doubt hinge on how this red line is
upheld.]{.underline}" "Future stability of China-U.S. relations will no
doubt hinge on how this red line is upheld." A forceful response from
President Tsai Ing-wen of the independence-leaning Democratic
Progressive Party in Taiwan had a galvanizing effect at a time when she
faces lukewarm support at home. [Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of
Defense reported this week its concern that China's military buildup is
focused on retaking Taiwan and defending against potential U.S.
intervention.]{.underline} President Jimmy Carter was a catalyst in all
this historical drama. After President Richard Nixon's visit to China in
1972, Mr. Carter went ahead with the decision to switch diplomatic
recognition from Taiwan, a U.S. ally, to the People's Republic of China
in 1979. The 40-year anniversary of that move was the subject of the
Carter Center symposium, which attracted prominent China scholars to
Atlanta to discuss how to build on the past four decades of
collaboration. Mr. Carter's move was bold at the time. Opposition to
abandoning Taiwan was strong and required both assurances of U.S.
protection (see the Taiwan Relations Act) and an exercise in strategic
ambiguity. Starting in the Shanghai communique in 1972, the U.S.
acknowledged that there was only one China and that both sides claim
Taiwan as a part of it, but it has never held the policy officially that
Taiwan is a part of the People's Republic of China. Mr. Carter, however,
seemed to say that this distinction didn't come into play until his
Joint Communique on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations with
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping Dec. 15, 1978, which affirmed the Shanghai
communique and added this language: The Government of the United States
of America acknowledges the Chinese position that there is but one China
and Taiwan is part of China. In his Friday speech following the Chinese
ambassador, Mr. Carter said the "breakthrough" moment in his talks with
Mr. Deng came when the two sides settled the Taiwan issue: "For many
years after \[Nixon's visit\], under him and President Ford, we
continued to recognized Taiwan as the only China, and I didn't think
that was correct. I had visited China quite early in my life and had
grown up with a very deep interest in China." "We had a breakthrough
when we finally resolved the very difficult issue of Taiwan and China's
relationship with Taiwan. To make a very complicated issue real simple,
we agreed that there was only one China and that Taiwan is a part of
China. But Deng Xiaoping agreed with me that any resolution of that
altercation with Taiwan would be done in a peaceful way." Mr. Xi's new
year's speech was meant to echo Mr. Deng's message to Taiwan in 1979,
which called for both sides to work toward peaceful reunification as
China embarked on a path of opening its economy to the outside world.
Shelley Rigger, an expert on Taiwan at Davidson College who was
attending the Carter Center forum, said the former president's
statements weren't wildly off base, but that they didn't reflect the
nuance of U.S. policy since 1972. "I think it was a kind of a shortcut.
Under different circumstances (the remarks) would not be a big deal.
Under these circumstances, in this particular venue, they could be
problematic in a potentially troubling way," she told Global Atlanta.
[China has taken a harder line on Taiwan since the DPP took power in
2016, poaching its dwindling number of allies and even going so far as
to pressure global companies like Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines to list
Taiwan as a part of China on their websites.]{.underline} Dr. Rigger
said [China is also more wary of Mr. Trump than previous presidents,
given the moves he has already made and his general
unpredictability.]{.underline} "[With this administration, you just
don't know what they might do. **Any movement is a little bit more
worrisome for China**]{.underline}," Dr. Rigger said. Mr. Cui urged both
sides to build trust, suggesting "unfounded worries" about China in the
U.S. are due to a lack of understanding about both China's history and
present-day goals of "peaceful development." Collaboration through
communication is key, he said. "[When this is done, **the possibilities
of miscalculation will be greatly reduced.** Of course, some
self-claimed strategists may still refuse to face the realities. They
may still try to sell conspiracy theories of various kinds to the world,
perhaps because they themselves are true conspirators. We need to
promote cooperation so as to expand common interests and avoid vicious
rivalry]{.underline}." Vincent Liu, a diplomat representing Taiwan at
Atlanta's Taipei Economic and Cultural Office, said during a discussion
with Global Atlanta in September that Taiwan has always aimed to
maintain a steady foreign policy even when dealing with tumultuous
periods. He didn't comment directly on China's more aggressive
diplomatic posture toward Taiwan, but he welcomed the Trump
administration's receptivity, shown by actions like the Taiwan Travel
Act. "When the United States and Taiwan say we are partners, we share
common values, we mean it, and this is a good way to prove that," Mr.
Liu said of the law.

### Chinese Invasion 🡪 US Intervention

[If the United States chose to intervene, US aircraft from bases in the
region could begin flying missions within hours]{.underline}. [China
might try to impede this by firing missiles to temporarily knock out
runways used by US aircraft, but this would reduce the number of
missiles available to hit Taiwan, and also bring Japan's military forces
fully into a war]{.underline}. Even if it won the military campaign,
Beijing would face the daunting prospect of trying to rule a society
that was accustomed to democratic governance and would be inveterately
hostile towards China for generations to come. Tibet would appear
quiescent by comparison. An important part of the calculation, of
course, is the likely US reaction[. The US government still has strong
incentives to prevent China's invasion of Taiwan]{.underline}. US
President Donald [Trump has made public statements questioning the value
of US alliances in Asia]{.underline}. During the summit with Kim Jong-un
in Singapore, Trump revealed a hope that US troops would eventually
leave South Korea. [But 18 months into his presidency, the
administration has not taken steps to disengage from US alliances or to
reduce US military forward deployment. Trump's senior advisers seem
committed not only to maintaining US strategic leadership in the western
Pacific Rim, but also taking a more confrontational posture with
Chin]{.underline}a, as reflected in the recently published policies on
security and defence. These characterised China as more adversary than
partner, a reverse of the Obama administration rhetoric. As a concrete
example, US "freedom of navigation operations" in the South China Sea
have increased relative to the Obama administration. [Polls in the
United States show only a minority of Americans would favour US military
personnel fighting to defend Taiwan]{.underline}. Members of Congress,
however, are more supportive. They realise America's leadership position
in the region would be severely if not fatally compromised if the United
States stood aside while a large authoritarian state and opponent of the
US-sponsored regional order gobbled up a small democracy that has strong
historical ties to America. They believe in the "democratic peace
theory": democracies don't fight against each other, so democratisation
throughout the world increases the space within which no serious threats
to US security will arise. They understand that Taiwan is the
"unsinkable aircraft carrier" that anchors the first island chain,
limiting the geostrategic platform from which China might otherwise
attempt to dominate eastern Asia. [A decision by Washington not to
intervene in a Taiwan Strait conflict in which China appeared to be the
aggressor would represent a dramatic shift in US strategy]{.underline}.
The overt attempts to politically distance the island from China [while
Chen Shui-bian was Taiwan's president from 2000 to 2008 prompted
Washington to say it would not necessarily intervene if Taiwan seemed to
provoke an attack. US policymakers, however, do not see President Tsai
Ing-wen as a provocateur]{.underline}. The Communist Party's recent
position on Taiwan is counterproductive. Reunifying Taiwan is not
necessary for China to be secure and prosperous, as is manifestly
obvious. [Worse, an obsession with the Taiwan issue could work against
other important goals, beginning with successfully managing the
difficult but necessary project of economic restructuring. Clearly,
Beijing needs a better approach than threatening Taiwan with
attack.]{.underline}

[The United States will not stand by to allow any non-peaceful attempt
to unilaterally alter the status quo of Taiwan, a senior US diplomat has
said in an apparent **warning against Beijing's threats** to retake the
self-ruled island, by force if necessary]{.underline}. [Washington would
also **do all it could to help Taiwan**]{.underline} rejoin some
international organisations such as Interpol, the official said, despite
strong protests from Beijing, which considers Taiwan a wayward province.
In his debut press conference on the island on Wednesday, [Brent
Christensen, the new director of the US de facto embassy, the American
Institute in Taiwan, signalled **stronger US support** for the island in
the face of persistent pressure from Beijing against
Taipei.]{.underline} "I am here to tell you that [US policy towards
Taiwan has not changed]{.underline}," Christensen said. "[Any effort to
determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means represents a
threat to the **peace and security** of the Western Pacific area and is
of **grave concern** to the United States. "We are opposed to unilateral
attempts to change the status quo]{.underline}." Since Tsai Ing-wen, of
the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, became the
island's president in 2016 and refused to accept the one-China
principle, [**Beijing has stepped up pressure against Taiwan**,
including staging war games around the island and poaching five of
Taipei's allies. It has also demanded that international companies,
including airlines, change the title of Taiwan to either a Chinese
province or "China, Taiwan" to indicate that the island is a part of
China.]{.underline} The principle is part of an understanding reached in
1992 between unofficial representatives of Beijing and Taipei that there
is only "one China", but each side would have its own interpretation of
what constitutes "China". Christensen said that as the new [US envoy to
Taiwan he would do all he could to promote **security cooperation**
between Washington and Taipei, saying "**promoting security
cooperation** and improving Taiwan's self-defence capability go hand in
hand]{.underline}". He also said [it was the US' "**obligation to
support Taiwan** in maintaining a sufficient self-defence capability
against coercion]{.underline}" and this policy was consistent for both
the Democratic and Republican parties. He cited the [Trump
administration's approval of two arms sales, including the US\$330
million deal]{.underline} for spare parts for the island's F-16s and
other warplanes, as examples of that commitment. He said [one of his
four priorities]{.underline} as the institute's director was to [promote
Taiwan's participation in the international community]{.underline}. "As
we face a multitude of global challenges -- the impacts of global health
pandemics; transnational terrorism and crime; and the insidious spread
of disinformation, to name a few -- [we cannot afford to exclude a
society \[Taiwan\] with so much to offer the world]{.underline}," he
said. [['**Prepare for war'**, Xi Jinping tells military region that
monitors
Taiwan]{.underline}](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/2170452/prepare-war-xi-jinping-tells-military-region-monitors-south)
He said [the US had long been a **vocal supporter** of Taiwan's
meaningful participation in international organisations]{.underline}.
"We continue our informal consultations and engagement to allow Taiwan
to have a more substantive role in the international community," he
said, adding that the broader engagement would benefit the global
community. He said [he expected high-level US officials would visit
Taiwan in line with the newly enacted Taiwan Travel Act]{.underline},
which allows exchanges of top-level officials between Taiwan and the
United States. [Christensen said the institute would move to its US\$255
million new compound at the end of this year]{.underline} and he hoped
it would be a good chance for a high-level US official to visit.
[Christensen's comments are expected to again **infuriate** Beijing,
which has loudly protested against the US for supplying arms to Taiwan
and allowing senior officials to visit the island]{.underline} -- acts
the mainland says violates the one-China policy that Washington
committed to observe after switching official recognition to Beijing.

As China grows more powerful, it may increasingly resent U.S. influence
in Northeast Asia. But unless U.S.-Chinese relations become severely
strained, China is likely to accept a continuing U.S. presence in the
region, given the alternatives. ACCOMMODATION ON TAIWAN? THE PROSPECTS
for avoiding intense military competition and war may be good, but
growth in China\'s power may nevertheless require some changes in U.S.
foreign policy that Washington will find disagreeable\--particularly
regarding Taiwan. Although it lost control of Taiwan during the Chinese
Civil War more than six decades ago, [China still considers Taiwan to be
part of its homeland, and unification remains a key political goal for
Beijing. China has made clear that it will use force if Taiwan declares
independence, and much of China\'s conventional military buildup has
been dedicated to increasing its ability to coerce Taiwan and reducing
the United States\' ability to intervene.]{.underline} Because China
places such high value on Taiwan and because the United States and
China\--whatever they might formally agree to\--have such different
attitudes regarding the legitimacy of the status quo, the issue poses
special dangers and challenges for the U.S.-Chinese relationship,
placing it in a different category than Japan or South Korea. [A crisis
over Taiwan could fairly easily escalate to nuclear war, because each
step along the way might well seem rational to the actors
involved.]{.underline} Current U.S. policy is designed to reduce the
probability that Taiwan will declare independence and to make clear that
the United States will not come to Taiwan\'s aid if it does.
Nevertheless, [the United States would find itself under pressure to
protect Taiwan against any sort of attack, no matter how it
originated]{.underline}. Given the different interests and perceptions
of the various parties and the limited control Washington has over
Taipei\'s behavior, [a crisis could unfold in which the United States
found itself following events rather than leading them]{.underline}.
Such dangers have been around for decades, but [ongoing improvements in
China\'s military capabilities may make Beijing more willing to escalate
a Taiwan crisis]{.underline}. In addition to its improved conventional
capabilities, [China is modernizing its nuclear forces to increase their
ability to survive and retaliate following a large-scale U.S.
attack]{.underline}. Standard deterrence theory holds that Washington\'s
current ability to destroy most or all of China\'s nuclear force
enhances its bargaining position. China\'s nuclear modernization might
remove that check on Chinese action, leading Beijing to behave more
boldly in future crises than it has in past ones. A U.S. attempt to
preserve its ability to defend Taiwan, meanwhile, could fuel a
conventional and nuclear arms race. Enhancements to U.S. offensive
targeting capabilities and strategic ballistic missile defenses might be
interprete[7c69e](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3021185.pdf?refrecid=excelsior%3Abdd6a0551af9eb1e292ae0809b57c69e))
Answering the question of what policy solutions can mitigate the
problems caused by U.S. arms sales to Taiwan is complex. The issue is
not just one of differing political interpretations between the 1982
U.S.-PRC Joint Communique and the TRA. These two documents are at
loggerheads where fundamental foreign policy differences between the
U.S. and China collide. U.S. efforts to exert its global and regional
influence exacerbate long-held Chinese suspicions of U.S. aspirations to
hegemony. In turn, China\'s drive to modernize its military along with
Beijing\'s domestic and international behavior exacerbate equally
long-held suspicions of China in the U.S. This has left Taiwan as the
destination of U.S. d by China as a signal of malign U.S. motives,
leading to further Chinese military efforts and a general poisoning of
U.S.-Chinese relations. [Given such risks, the United States should
consider backing away from its commitment to Taiwan. This would remove
the most obvious and contentious flash point between the United States
and China and smooth the way for better relations between them in the
decades to come.]{.underline} Critics of such a move argue that it would
result in not only direct costs for the United States and Taiwan but
indirect costs as well: Beijing would not be satisfied by such
appeasement; instead, it would find its appetite whetted and make even
greater demands afterward\--spurred by Washington\'s lost credibility as
a defender of its allies. The critics are wrong, however, because
territorial concessions are not always bound to fail. Not all
adversaries are Hitler, and when they are not, accommodation can be an
effective policy tool.

### AT: No Conflict

#### Both sides emboldened to fight due to US -- Taiwan involvement, including Taiwan strive for independence

AD

The state media said [Beijing was sending a loud and clear warning to
Taipei and Washington amid heightened tensions caused by Taiwanese
leaders' open advocacy for independence and increased American support
for the Taiwanese government.]{.underline} Over the past few weeks,
Chinese officials and state media have ratcheted up the rhetoric against
Taipei and Washington, the largest supplier of arms to the island.
Trump's trade war with China is just his opening gambit Referring to
Thursday's live-fire drills, Cui Tiankai, the [Chinese ambassador to US,
warned in a lecture at Harvard University that [China would try
every]{.mark} possible [means to defend]{.mark} its [sovereignty]{.mark}
and territorial integrity]{.underline}. Earlier this month, a [spokesman
for the Taiwan Affairs Office, said any outside forces that attempted to
"play the Taiwan card" would find their efforts "futile" and would hurt
themselves if they went "over the line", according to the official China
Daily]{.underline}. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen speaks on the
telephone to Donald Trump. Photo: EPA Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen
speaks on the telephone to Donald Trump. Photo: EPA Share: [The remark
was clearly aimed at US President Donald Trump and his administration
which in recent months has taken a number of significant steps to warm
ties with Taipei.]{.underline} As Beijing and Washington are currently
positioning themselves for a possible trade war, [[Trump's]{.mark}
intention to play the Taiwan card again is even more dangerous because
this [would further destabilise bilateral ties or]{.mark} even
worse,]{.underline} could **[[lead to a real war]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
But it needn't be terminal True to Trump's unconventional and
unpredictable presidency, he first started to play the Taiwan card in
the transition to the White House when he took a congratulatory call
from the Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen, breaking a nearly 40-year-old
diplomatic protocol governing China-US ties. [At that time, Trump made
it clear his intention was to use Taiwan as a play to force more
concessions on trade from China]{.underline}. His suggestion then was
overwhelmingly met with criticism and cynicism almost everywhere, even
in Taiwan where it raised concerns that the island could be used as a
pawn and discarded easily. [[China]{.mark} sees Taiwan as a province and
usually [reacts]{.mark} strongly [to]{.mark} any foreign country having
official contacts with the Taiwanese government or [sale of arms]{.mark}
to the island, particularly from the United States]{.underline}. Now one
year later, [[Trump's]{.mark} intention to play the Taiwan card again
signals a much broader agenda [targeting China]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Almost all the moderating voices in his administration have been forced
out and replaced by more hawkish officials including the soon-to-be
secretary of state Mike Pompeo and the National Security Adviser John
Bolton -- both of whom are known for tough stances against China and
pro-Taiwan views. Tough on China: US national security adviser John
Bolton. Photo: Reuters Tough on China: US national security adviser John
Bolton. Photo: Reuters Share: In recent months, [his administration has
approved licences for American firms to sell Taiwan technology to build
submarines and signed the Taiwan Travel Act to encourage visits between
American and Taiwanese officials]{.underline}. [All these have invited
protests from China]{.underline}. A major test will come in June when
the American Institute in Taiwan, the US de facto embassy, is slated to
move into a new building. There has been growing speculation that Bolton
or some other senior US official will attend the ceremony. If that
happens, Beijing will regard it as a major provocation. It is
interesting to note that amid the war of words with Washington over
trade, some elements in Beijing's propaganda machine have been using
warlike language to give the impression that China will not back down
from the trade spat and will fight the US to the very end. That could
well be a negotiation tactic, as trade issues are negotiable after all.
[But from the Chinese perspective, the Taiwan issue is absolutely
non-negotiable. It is a clearly marked red line]{.underline}. **[The
[Taiwanese leaders]{.mark}, [encouraged by]{.mark} the latest warming
signs from [Washington]{.mark}, have [started to]{.mark} openly
[advocate]{.mark} [independence]{.mark}, which is a major taboo for
Beijing and seen as breaking the status quo.]{.underline}** Over the
past 40 years, Beijing and Taipei have tried to maintain the status quo
in which both sides recognise the island as part of China, even while
neither government recognises the legitimacy of the other. Taiwan agrees
not to broach independence, in return mainland China does not use force
to take over the island. Washington recognises this one-China principle
but maintains close unofficial ties with Taiwan and provides the island
with arms under the Taiwan Relations Act -- a constant source of
friction with Beijing. Taiwanese Premier William Lai. Photo: EPA

worker for Taiwanese independence]{.underline}". Although this was not
the first time he has said this, Lai's latest declaration caused serious
worries in Beijing in the context of Washington's warming ties with
Taipei. [The heightened tensions over the Taiwan Strait have come as Xi
embarks on his second term as China's most powerful leader since Mao
Zedong]{.underline}. Last month the national legislature repealed the
term limits on the presidency, enabling Xi to rule as long as he likes.
[With Xi trying to assert China's power on the international stage,
[flexing China's military]{.mark} muscle in the Taiwan Strait in the
name of pushing back against the independence movement is likely [to
bolster Xi's support]{.mark} on the mainland]{.underline}. China's
official line has always been that it will seek peaceful reunification
with Taiwan but not rule out using force to take it over. In the past,
officials and state media have tended to emphasise the peaceful
reunification part -- more recently they have highlighted the bit about
using force. Moreover, China has never publicly stated a timetable for
reunification with Taiwan but some mainland analysts have started to
preach the idea that reunification could take place by 2035 or 2050. As
China beats its war drum, who should hear its call? These assumptions
stemmed from Xi's landmark report at the Communist Party's 19th congress
in October when he outlined a clearly defined timetable to realise what
he called the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation -- China would
basically become a modern country by 2035 and a world power by 2050. For
an ambitious leader like Xi, reunification with Taiwan has to be an
integral part of the dream. So will the US join the fray if push comes
to shove? Many people have mistakenly assumed the Taiwan Relations Act
requires the US to come to Taiwan's defence. In fact, the law contains
no explicit guarantee. Besides, there is a big question over whether the
US would risk waging a full-blown war with China over Taiwan. [In the
short term, if the current trend continues with the [US]{.mark}
determined to play the Taiwan card -- **which in turn helps
[embolden]{.mark} the pro-[independence]{.mark} movement in
Taiwan**]{.underline} -- China will probably feel compelled to
accelerate its military preparations and increase the frequency of
military shows of strength like the one last week. [All this means that
tensions over the [Taiwan Strait will get much worse]{.mark} [unless
Trump rethinks]{.mark} his plan to play the Taiwan card.]{.underline}

### AT: Taiwan Will Win

#### The war will not be short -- a China-Taiwan war would be long and drawn out 

**Westcott** 20**19**

bloody, logistical nightmare", June 24, 2019, date accessed 6/26/2019,

Taiwan (CNN)Roaring out of the sky, an F-16V fighter jet lands smoothly
to rearm and refuel on an unremarkable freeway in rural Taiwan,
surrounded by rice paddies. In different circumstances, this could be
alarming sight. Taiwan\'s fighter pilots are trained to land on freeways
between sorties in case all of the island\'s airports have been occupied
or destroyed by an invasion. Luckily, this was a training exercise.
[There\'s only really one enemy that Taiwan\'s armed forces are
preparing to resist \-- China\'s People\'s Liberation Army]{.underline}
(PLA). And as [China\'s reputation as an **economic and military
superpowe**r has grown in recent years, so too has that **threat of
invasion**, according to security experts]{.underline}. Taiwan has been
[self-governed](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/28/asia/taiwan-us-china-bolton-intl/index.html)
since separating from China at the end of a brutal civil war in 1949,
but [Beijing has never given up hope of reuniting with what it considers
a renegade province]{.underline}. At a regional security conference in
June, Chinese [Defense Minister Wei Fenghe
said:](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-06/02/c_138110665.htm?mc_cid=cf6454682b&mc_eid=a324da7757)
\"[If anyone dares to split Taiwan from China, the Chinese military has
no choice but to **fight at all costs for national unity**.\" In some
shops in mainland China, you can buy postcards and T-shirts emblazoned
with patriotic emblems promoting the retaking of Taiwan]{.underline}.
But for seven decades, [China has resisted attacking Taiwan partly for
political reasons, including the **prospect of a US intervention** and
the potential heavy human toll. But the practical realities of a
**full-blown invasion** are also daunting for the PLA]{.underline},
according to experts. Ferrying hundreds of thousands of troops across
the narrow Taiwan Strait to a handful of reliable landing beaches, in
the face of fierce resistance, is a harrowing prospect. Troops would
then have a long slog over Taiwan\'s western mudflats and mountains to
reach the capital, Taipei. Not only that, [but China would face an
opponent who has been preparing for war for almost 70
years]{.underline}. At mass anti-invasion drills in May, Taiwan military
spokesman Maj. Gen. Chen Chung-Chi said the island knew it had to always
be \"combat-ready.\" \"Of course, we don\'t want war, but only by
gaining our own strength can we defend ourselves,\" he said. \"[If China
wants to take any action against us, it has to consider paying a
**painful price**.\" **Difficult and bloody** It could be easy to assume
that any invasion of Taiwan by Beijing would be brief and devastating
for Taipei]{.underline}: a David and Goliath fight between a tiny island
and the mainland\'s military might, population and wealth. With nearly
[1.4
billion](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html)
people, the People\'s Republic of China has the largest population in
the world. Taiwan has fewer than 24 million people \-- a similar number
to Australia. [China has the fifth largest territory in the
world]{.underline}, while Taiwan is the size of Denmark or the US state
of Maryland. And Beijing runs an economy that is second only to the
United States, while Taiwan\'s doesn\'t rank in the world\'s top 20. But
perhaps most pertinently, C[hina has been [building and modernizing its
military](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/04/asia/china-military-xi-jinping-intl/index.html)
at an unprecedented rate,]{.underline} while Taiwan relies on moderate
US arms sales. In sheer size, [the PLA simply dwarfs Taiwan\'s
military]{.underline}. China has an estimated 1 million troops, almost
6,000 tanks, 1,500 fighter jets and 33 navy destroyers, according to the
latest [US Defense Department
report.](https://media.defense.gov/2019/May/02/2002127082/-1/-1/1/2019_CHINA_MILITARY_POWER_REPORT.pdf)
Taiwan\'s ground force troops barely number 150,000 and are backed by
800 tanks and about 350 fighter aircraft, the report found, while its
navy fields only four destroyer-class ships. Under Chinese President Xi
Jinping, [the PLA has rapidly
modernized](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/04/asia/china-military-xi-jinping-intl/index.html),
buoyed by rises in military spending and crackdowns on corruption in the
army\'s leadership. \"China\'s leaders hope that [possessing these
military capabilities will deter pro-independence moves by Taiwan or,
should deterrence fail, will permit a range of tailored military options
against Taiwan and potential **third-party military
intervention**]{.underline},\" according to a 2019 [US Defense
Intelligence Agency
report](https://www.dia.mil/Portals/27/Documents/News/Military%20Power%20Publications/China_Military_Power_FINAL_5MB_20190103.pdf)
on China\'s military. Yet while China hawks in the media might beat the
drum of invasion, an internal China military study, seen by CNN,
revealed that the PLA considers an invasion of Taiwan to be extremely
difficult. \"[Taiwan has a professional military, with a **strong core
of American**-trained experts]{.underline},\" said Ian Easton, author of
\"The Chinese Invasion Threat\" and research fellow at the Project 2049
Institute, as well as \"highly defensible\" terrain. In his book he
described [an invasion by China as \"the **most difficult and bloody**
mission facing the Chinese military]{.underline}.\"

#### And China thinks it can win -- makes conflict likely

In the end, [absent a U.S. and Japanese commitment to intervene in the
early stages of an attempted PLA invasion]{.underline} of Taiwan, there
is only a [slim likelihood that the Taiwanese military would be able to
"defeat" its opponent]{.underline} in the conventional sense of the
term. The force disparity between the two sides has simply become too
wide. As such, under prevailing circumstances, the [only way that Taiwan
can defeat China is to make sure that]{.underline} the PLA is
[never]{.underline} used to [attack]{.underline} [Taiwan]{.underline}.
Deterrence, therefore, is its most credible asset, and one which it can
put to much better use.

### AT Taiwan Will Win -- China Strategic Reform 

#### Taiwan wont win -- PLA strategic reforms account for Taiwan's military capabilities

the Groundwork for War with Taiwan, 06/24/19,

MELBOURNE, Australia -- [China is improving and increasing its options
for a possible future invasion of Taiwan]{.underline}, [with military
reforms and investments in multi-domain military capabilities offering a
range of options to defeat the self-governing island]{.underline},
according to a Pentagon report. [These options range from an air and sea
blockade of Taiwan to a full-scale invasion,]{.underline} although the
latter option would require a significant increase in the number of
amphibious ships, according to the latest annual China Military Power
Report released Thursday by the Department of Defense. Nevertheless,
[the report cautioned that the People's Liberation Army or PLA's efforts
to convert the bulk of its maneuver units to combined arms
brigades,]{.underline} "should eventually create more capable, modular
brigades and battalions," while the "expansion of army aviation and the
creation of two new air assault brigades also provides more attack, air
assault and close air support options for a Taiwan invasion. [China's
PLA has also made efforts to improve its ability to insert forces by
air, by restructuring its airborne corps and establishing air assault
units, which would be charged with aerial insertion and seizing key
terrain.]{.underline} This restructure saw it reorganizing its previous
units into airborne infantry brigades, a special operations brigade, an
aviation brigade, and a support brigade, with the corps conducting
training exercises in 2018 that involved long-range raid and airborne
operations based on actual war plans. [The service has also established
a joint logistics support force in late 2016, with the primary goal of
supporting a strategic campaign such as a Taiwan invasion.]{.underline}
This would be accomplished through command and control of joint
logistics, delivering of materiel, and managing various civil-military
integration support mechanisms[. It's strategic support force would then
be responsible for the use of electronic warfare and cyber operations
during a Taiwan contingency]{.underline}, by "seizing and maintaining
battlefield information control in contemporary informatized warfare."
[The report added that the PLA is likely still exploring how to reform
its joint command processes to integrate information operations and
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities more fully at
the theater-level, but noted that the structural reforms have removed
the biggest barriers to integrating these strategic
capabilities]{.underline}. Nonetheless, the report raises questions
about China's current ability to conduct a full-scale invasion. Despite
advances in the quality and quantity of its surface combatants and
submarines, the PLA Navy has in recent years only acquired a small
number of landing platform docks "indicating a near term focus on
smaller scale expeditionary missions rather than a large number of
\[Landing Ship Tanks\] and medium landing craft that would be necessary
for a large-scale direct beach assault."The preparedness of the recently
expanded PLA Marine Corps was also in doubt, with exercises rarely going
beyond battalion level events, and its newly raised brigades yet to
receive "their full complement of required equipment and not fully
mission capable." As a consequence, [the report noted that the scope of
training for these units was "rudimentary and the new brigades remain
unequipped to perform amphibious assault operations,\" concluding that
an invasion of Taiwan, besides being fraught with significant political
risk, "would likely strain China's armed forces]{.underline}."

### AT No Escalation 

#### Yes escalation -- arms sales to Taiwan makes escalation inevitable 

**Tanious 18**

**(Mina E. Tanious 07 July 2018, General Authority for Investment and
Free Zones (GAFI), Giza, Egypt and Faculty of Economics and Political
Science, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt, "The impact of economic
interdependence on the probability of conflict between states: The case
of "American--Chinese relationship on Taiwan since 1995", REVIEW OF
ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE VOLUME 4, ISSUE 1, AD)**

According to the 1982 USA--China Joint Declaration, WA committed to
gradually reduce the supply of arms to Taipei, In return, Beijing vowed
to resolve the issue peacefully. However, [In the 1990s, US arms sales
to Taiwan increased. In 1992, the Bush administration sold 150 F-16s to
Taipei and between 1991 and 1998, the USA arms sales to Taiwan was
totaled by \$20bn. On the occasion of USA Vice President Al Gore's visit
to Beijing in March 1997, Chinese prime minister Wen Jiabao requested
Washington to stop arming Taiwan and stressed on the fact of continuing
USA arming of Taiwan is one of the reasons for the tension in bilateral
relations.]{.underline} On January 29, 2010, the Defense Cooperation
Agency of the US Department of Defense announced its approval of the
long-awaited arms deal valued about US\$6.4bn. This deal included
advanced Patriot missiles, radar, Black Hawk helicopters and others of
modern weapons. [China's reaction to the arms deal between the USA and
Taiwan: China has stopped exchanges and military ties with the United
States.]{.underline} China called-up the US ambassador to "Beijing" to
make a formal complaint showing rejection and resentment of the arms
deal. The Chinese Government expressed its dissatisfaction with the
USAs' support for Taiwan militarily and that this would undoubtedly
affect cooperation with the USA in other fields. [China has taken a
strong stance and explicitly threatened punitive measures against US
companies, such as US firm Boeing, which is involved in arms sales to
Taiwan.]{.underline} China suspended its cooperation with the USA in the
framework of coordinating the Copenhagen conference on climate change
problems[. It also announced at the same month that it will be testing
its missile defense recently.]{.underline} Because of the desire of the
USA to maintain its relationship with China in the framework of mutual
economic cooperation between them, The Obama administration regretted
the deterioration of relations with China, and the reason for this is
the recognition by the American side of the existence of common
interests between the two countries, especially in the economic sphere,
where the USA is well aware that the impact of relations between the two
countries would negatively affect USA economic interests. Adding that
this would do harm to US companies that benefit heavily from Chinese
markets such as Boeing and other companies.

[In light of two arms sales approved by the Trump administration in a
relatively short-time span, in June 2017 (\$1.4 billion) and September
2018 (\$330 million), America is also considering to normalizing its
arms sales to Taiwan (the United States will move away from its previous
"bundling" method toward a case-by-case approach) to more swiftly and
timely address the ROC's security and defensive imperatives]{.underline}
("U.S. Moves toward Normal," 2018). As of this writing, [the Trump
administration is reportedly to have tacitly approved a new arms sales
request from Taiwan to purchase more than 60 F-16V fighter jets.
**Beijing has already expressed stern opposition** to such a
deal]{.underline} (the last time Washington sold the more sophisticated
F-16s to Taipei was in 1992 under the George H.W. Bush administration),
and **[if the U.S. formally endorses the package, it would certainly
exacerbate the already deteriorating Sino-American
relations]{.underline}** ("China Protests Possible Trump Move to Sell
F-16s to Taiwan," 2019). [The Trump government has agreed to issue the
marketing license required for U.S. defense manufacturers to engage with
Taiwan regarding the possibility of working on its indigenous submarine
program]{.underline}. That project had been stalled since the George W.
Bush administration (Chung, 2018). [But, the actual selling of
technology needing to build the submarines would require another license
later.]{.underline} [American military industries, arms strategists, and
defense officials have also enhanced their contacts with their Taiwanese
counterparts in the annual U.S.-Taiwan Defense Conference Forum.
Meanwhile, the U.S. military has increased the frequency and publicity
Tilting toward Taiwan in an Era of US-PRC Rivalry 263 of its warship
transits through the Taiwan Strait's international waters,
**demonstrating America's commitment to Taiwan's security.** President
Trump probably learned from the lesson of his call with Tsai how
strongly Beijing would react to any challenges to the One-China
issue]{.underline}. Nonetheless, [the Trump administration has not
ceased putting forward more hardened campaign to counter Chinese global
and regional assertiveness. For many hardliners in the executive branch
and U.S. Congress, the United States must step up its support for Taiwan
for both strategic and normative reasons.]{.underline} Even before Obama
left office, major senatorial and congressional members, the media,
left- and right-leaning think tanks and interest groups were strongly
advocating change that would allow for a U.S. Taiwan policy which is
less deferential to Beijing. From a national-security perspective, many
have urged the U.S. government to pay attention to using Taiwan's
strategic location (situated in the so-called first island chain) to
counter the PRC's ambitions to undermine American strategic interests
around China's rim. [Washington could strengthen its military
cooperation with Taipei to constrain and deny Chinese naval expansion
and activities. They also suggested that as China pursues policies and
practices grossly at odds with U.S. interests, increasing American
support for Taiwan could constitute a "cost imposition strategy" to show
Xi that his various challenges to U.S. interests "would not be cost free
and actually **would be counterproductive for Chinese concerns** on the
all-important Taiwan issue]{.underline}" (Sutter, 2018a, pp. 223--224).
[In contrast, another school of thought simply recommends that U.S. deal
with Taiwan "for its own sake, rather than in a contingent way dependent
on U.S. interests with China"]{.underline} (Sutter, 2018b, pp.
219--220). As an exemplar of successful democracy, Taiwan, in their
opinion, deserves to be treated with greater respect, dignity and more
pronounced role in American foreign relations and the international
community. Proponents of this camp, including Senators Ted Cruz, Marco
Rubio, Cory Gardner, House Representatives Eliot Engel, Ted Yoho, Steve
Chabot, Brad Sherman, to name just a few, have voiced strident
complaints about Beijing's intimidation of its regional neighbors
including Taiwan. They are in favor of more frequent U.S. cabinet-level
visits to Taiwan as well as selling more advanced American military
equipment to the ROC. Accordingly, in spring 2018, both chambers of the
U.S. Congress unanimously approved the passage of the Taiwan Travel Act,
which states: It is the sense of Congress that the United States
Government should encourage visits between officials from the United
States and Taiwan at all levels.... It should be the policy of the
United States to (i) allow officials at all levels of the United States
Government, including Cabinet-level national security officials, general
officers, and other executive branch officials, to travel to Taiwan to
meet their Taiwanese counterparts; (ii) allow high level officials of
Taiwan to enter the United States, under conditions which demonstrate
appropriate respect for the dignity of such officials, and to meet with
officials in the United States, including officials from the Department
of State and the Department of Defense and other cabinet agencies; and
(iii) encourage the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office
and any other instrumentality established by Taiwan, to conduct business
in the United States, including activities which involve participation
by Members of Congress, officials of Federal, State, or local
governments of the United States, or any highlevel official of Taiwan.
("Taiwan Travel Act," 2018) 264 Asian Politics & Policy---Volume 11,
Issue 2---2019 On March 16, 2018, Trump signed the TTA into law, in
spite of strong protests from Beijing (Brunnstrom, 2018). [Some
observers described that "if U.S.-China relations and cross-strait
relations are bad, Washington is more likely to try to play the Taiwan
card in a troubled engagement with Beijing, which makes China the odd
man out in the trilateral game"]{.underline} (Lin & deLisle, 2018, p.
9). The island is explicitly named one of America's "longstanding
military relationships... allies and partners" in the pursuit of a "free
and open Indo-Pacific" grand strategy ("National Security Strategy,"
2017, p. 47). The U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo underscored
Taiwan's "economic development, democratic society and high-tech
powerhouse" as fitting squarely with Washington's pursuit of like-minded
partnership and economic engagement in the Indo-Pacific region ("Remarks
by the Secretary of State," 2018). Trump signed, in addition to the TTA,
the National Defense Authorization Act of 2018 and 2019, respectively,
under which there are sections urging the U.S. government to strengthen
military relations with Taiwan, such as allowing for regular port calls
between the American and ROC navies and deepening personnel exchanges,
training, and exercises ("National Defense Authorization," 2017, 2018).
In NDAA 2019, [Democrats and Republicans in the Senate and House of
Representatives are in unison about the existential China threats and
urged the Trump White House to stand firmly against the PRC's "all of
nation longterm strategy" involving military modernization, influence
operations, espionage, and predatory economic policy to undermine the
United States and its interests abroad.]{.underline} In line with the
latest National Security Strategy, the national defense act directs a
whole-of-government approach to tackle Chinese aggressive behaviors in
the South China Sea, Indo-Pacific region and other "malicious
activities" such as economic coercion and technology theft (Sutter,
2018c, 2018d). [The U.S. Congress' hostility toward China has
intensified and its concerted support for Taiwan become more robust. On
December 31, 2018, President Trump signed into law the Asia Reassurance
Initiative Act, which contains provisions **reasserting U.S. commitments
to Taiwan's security and defense through regular arms sales** and
high-level official visits]{.underline} ("U.S. President Signs Bill,"
2019). The U.S. Senate is also pushing for a bill to strengthen the
international participation of Taiwan: Taiwan Allies International
Protection and Enhancement Initiative (Taipei) Act of 2018. On January
23, 2019, the House of Representatives unanimously passed a bill calling
the U.S. Secretary of State to help Taiwan "regain" its observer status
at the World Health Organization ("Taiwan Thanks U.S.," 2019). As well,
the Trump administration, under the more robust influence of
conservative nationalists and neoconservatives in charge of U.S.
economic, diplomatic, intelligence, and security apparatuses, such as
John Bolton (National Security Adviser), Matthew Pottinger (National
Security Council Senior Director for Asian Affairs), Randall Schriver
(U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asian and Pacific Security
Affairs), Robert Lighthizer (U.S. Trade Representative), and Peter
Navarro (Director of the White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing
Policy), has also shown greater sympathy toward Taiwan in opposition to
China (Wadhams, 2018). Shortly after the TTA was signed, a U.S. deputy
assistant secretary of state, Alex Wong, came to Taipei, standing next
to Taiwan's president Tsai Ing-wen, and stressed that "the aim of U.S.
policy is to ensure that Taiwan's people can continue along their chosen
path, free from coercion.... Our Tilting toward Taiwan in an Era of
US-PRC Rivalry 265 commitment to those goals has never been stronger"
(Horton, 2018, March). [When Beijing threatened penalties against
foreign businesses and companies, including U.S. airline carriers, for
referring to Taiwan, Macau, and Hong Kong as separate countries or
entities from mainland China on their web sites, the Trump White House
rebuked the PRC for engaging in "Orwellian nonsense," strongly objecting
to "China's attempts to compel private firms to use specific language of
political nature in their publicly available content."]{.underline}
("Statement from the Press Secretary China," 2018, May). Washington's
more supportive stance on Taiwan, in sum, is a measured response, based
on an alignment of both the U.S. executive and legislative branches, to
obvious shifts in the overarching Sino-American relationship: the
growingly assertive Chinese foreign policy behaviors and structural
intensification of U.S.-PRC power rivalry in the security, economic, and
technological realms. Furthermore, [Beijing has itself alarmed Taipei by
ramping up military exercises since Tsai's inauguration as Taiwan's
president, including flying bombers and other military aircraft around
the island and sending its aircraft carrier through the
strait]{.underline} ("U.S. Warships Pass Through," 2018). [The PRC's
efforts at taking away Taiwan's remaining diplomatic allies]{.underline}
(discussed in the next section) [and opposing Taipei's meaningful
unofficial participation at various international institutions and
forums, have led the U.S. government to openly accuse Beijing of
"altering the cross-strait status quo and undermining the framework that
has enabled peace, stability and development for decades"]{.underline}
("U.S. Accuses China," 2018). [However, notwithstanding Washington's
warming of ties with Taipei, two other notable trends simultaneously
characterize the Trump administration's cross-strait policy: (i)
reassurance to the PRC that it was not abetting de jure Taiwan
independence; and (ii) the president's penchant for transactional
treatment of foreign policy issues]{.underline}

military one, so we should discuss it in the layers of economy,
politics, and culture. Paraphrasing Einstein, "Simplify all things...but
not too much." Let us thus try to describe the vicious circle of Taiwan
arms sales. Politically, [[the President of]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark} people, now the extremely capable Ma
Ying-jeou, [in order to get elected]{.underline}, [[must
satisfy]{.underline}]{.mark} a large segment of

[constituency]{.mark}]{.underline} [[by asking the U.S. to

to Taiwan. [[The U.S.]{.mark} Administration]{.underline},
[[for]{.underline}]{.mark} domestic [[political reasons]{.underline},
[**must** offer arms]{.underline}]{.mark} [to Taiwan]{.underline} (The
large difference between what is approved and what is actually

[[protest]{.underline}]{.mark} [the interferences]{.underline} [of

been tasked, [[to show it]{.underline} **[can
deal]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[militarily [with
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A manifestation of this is demonstrated
in the large military build-up in Fukian province. A manisfestation is
that [[this is happening despite]{.mark} an environment of]{.underline}
increasing **[[cross-Strait economic activitie]{.mark}s]{.underline}**,
contact, and tourism. The goal enunciated in the Taiwan Relations
Act---"to preserve and promote extensive, close, and friendly
commercial, cultural, and other relations between the people of the
United States and the people on Taiwan, as well as the people on the
China mainland and all other peoples of the Western Pacific
area"---needs to be re-thought by all sides in a context broader than
military. Taiwan has over time and without encouragement become an
economically successful democratic polity. Of course, something as
sensitive as Taiwan policy should be changed only with great
deliberation. There are some in Washington and Beijing who talk quietly
of a new Taiwan Relations Act or 4th Joint Communiqué, but [[our
recommendation is that]{.underline}]{.mark} (1) dialogue on the
U.S.-China-Taiwan triangle be elevated from a mostly military to a
politicoeconomic dialogue and (2) that serious, official (perhaps
stemming from a Track Two, or non-government effort) [[steps be taken
to]{.underline} **[break the vicious circle]{.underline}**]{.mark}
described above. In our view the easiest, most statesmanlike, step could
be made by the PRC but this paper is about what the U.S. can do. [[There
is no better time to act than while relations]{.underline} [are working
well and]{.underline}]{.mark} both **[the U.S. and China need to expend
energies on other topics.]{.underline}**

#### Making concessions to China is key -- it's the only way to peacefully integrate them into the global liberal order -- the alternative is devastating transition wars

If you look at the total power in the world as a pie, the trend shows
that the size of the "pie" is growing. Therefore, [[the U.S.
will]{.underline}]{.mark} eventually **[[be less
dominant]{.underline}]{.mark}** in that sphere [[as nations like China
grow]{.mark} in influence]{.underline}. In order [to compensate for this
change]{.underline} in the world order, [[the U.S.
must]{.underline}]{.mark} **[help to [build a cooperative
relationship]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and move away from]{.underline} its
sense of **[dominance.]{.underline}** [[The policy of the
U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline} up to this point [[has been to]{.underline}
**[appear dominant at any cost]{.underline}**]{.mark}, but [[that
philosophy needs to]{.mark} reflect]{.underline} **[the
[chang]{.mark}ing world order]{.underline}**. The U.S. keeps trying to
fit China into an architecture that doesn't account for some adjustment
in how the U.S. sees its own role. There needs to be recognition that
**[things have changed]{.underline}** and that the presumptions of the
post Second World War system no longer apply in full with regards to
China. [[The relationship]{.underline}]{.mark} must change because it
**[[is]{.mark} ultimately [unsustainable]{.mark}]{.underline}** at the
current rate [and [the U.S. has]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[a lot at
risk]{.underline}**]{.mark} if the Chinese economy fails. In order to
increase China's international profile as a world power, the United
States could support China's broader participation in world
organizations such as the World Health Organization. This would also
increase the Chinese burden of protection in the world. One of the core
issues in the way of a strong relationship between China and the United
States is human rights, but human rights and the economy are not
necessarily linked. Therefore, in order to move forward, the U.S. might
need to recognize that the human rights issue might be deferred or
slowed until the economic issues have been set. U.S. administrations
historically attempted to manage the legal and political issues
regarding human rights in China instead of simply addressing the
relationship between the countries as a whole. This compartmentalizing
of the problems compounds the issues domestically and abroad. However,
there is some work that can be done with regards to political issues:
the U.S. could amend some of its conflicting legislation with regards to
China to make it more coherent. The fact remains that China needs
stability in order to grow economically, as does the United States and
the rest of the world. The Chinese also need the United States to help
shape the international and regional environment to promote stability.
The Chinese are pushing for a different monetary system where the dollar
does not reign; however, the strength of the dollar is one of the United
States' most important long term interests. In order to prove to China
the weight of the United States economy, there are several steps that
the U.S. can take. First, it can begin to do more business with
international counterweights to China such as India and Indonesia. The
U.S. is also strongly investing in Brazil and Mexico, so these
coordinated efforts with friends of the United States would make a huge
statement to China. Going through some trials and tribulations as
countries together builds bonds between nations, [China can begin with
**a peaceful resolution** to]{.underline} the [Taiwan]{.underline} issue
as a bond-building exercise. [In order for this to occur,]{.underline}
for example, [[the U.S. government could make]{.underline} [the decision
that]{.underline} **[arms sales are no longer
needed]{.underline}**]{.mark}, and in exchange ask that the Chinese
remove the missiles aimed at Taiwan. The United States would also like
to begin a nuclear dialogue and recognition in the assistance of
non-proliferation agreements. The resolution of this ongoing conflict
could signal a new beginning for an open dialogue with China.

the U.S.-China Trade War: Is a Conflict Over Taiwan the Real Threat?,\"
National Interest,
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/forget-us-china-trade-war-conflict-over-taiwan-real-threat-61627

[[Tensions]{.mark} between Taiwan and the]{.underline} People's Republic
of China ([PRC]{.underline}) **[[are surging]{.underline}]{.mark}** to
an alarming extent. The latest indicator is [the recent [exchange
of]{.mark} heated [rhetoric between]{.mark}]{.underline} Gen. Wei
Fenghe, [[China]{.mark}'s Minister of National Defense]{.underline},
[[and Taiwan]{.mark}'s Mainland Affairs Council]{.underline}, the
Taiwanese government's chief policymaking body dealing with cross-strait
relations. As Taiwan's self-proclaimed protector, Washington should be
extremely worried about these developments. Speaking on June 1 at the
Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual multilateral conference on Pacific
security issues, [[Wei warned against efforts]{.underline}]{.mark}
either in Taiwan or foreign countries **[[to
thwart]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[China's goal of
[reunification]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} Moreover, "[any
[underestimation of the PLA]{.mark}']{.underline}s resolve and will
**[[is]{.mark} extremely [dangerous]{.mark}]{.underline}**." Wei added
ominously that, "**[[If anyone]{.mark} dares to [split Taiwan from
China, the Chinese]{.mark} military [will]{.mark} have no choice but to
[fight]{.mark} at all costs]{.underline}**, at all costs, (sic.) for
national unity. If the PLA cannot even safeguard the unity of our
motherland, what do we need it for?" [The Mainland Affairs Council
responded with]{.underline} equally harsh and **[uncompromising
language]{.underline}**. In a statement issued the following day, [[the
council]{.underline}]{.mark} re[[asserted]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[Taiwan has]{.underline} **[never been]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[a
[part of the PRC]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and [would]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[never]{.underline}** [accept Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark}['s control
or threats]{.underline}. [[It accused China]{.underline}]{.mark} not
only [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[challenging international
norms]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and]{.underline} order," but added the
gratuitous slap that Beijing's claim to seek peaceful development was
"**[a lie of the ages]{.underline}**." Lest anyone not fully grasp the
extent of Taipei's hostility toward the PRC, the statement went on: "[We
need to remind the public that the Chinese]{.underline} [Communist Party
is practicing **anti-democracy**]{.underline}, anti-peace between the
two sides of the strait [and]{.underline} further **[resorting to
war]{.underline}**. This is the main cause of the tension in the Taiwan
Strait and the region, and it is the source of danger and provocation
against peace and stability." [The vitriolic exchange]{.underline}
[constituted a]{.underline} **[worrisome escalation]{.underline}** [of
the animosity]{.underline} between Taipei and Beijing that has been
roiling for the past three years. [The [victory of]{.mark} the
**[pro-independence]{.mark}**]{.underline} Democratic Progressive
[[Party]{.underline}]{.mark} (DPP) [[in Taiwan]{.mark}'s 2016
elections]{.underline} **[[dashed]{.mark} any
[hopes]{.mark}]{.underline}** [Chinese leaders had
[that]{.mark}]{.underline} the burgeoning [[economic ties]{.mark} with
the mainland [would translate]{.mark}]{.underline} gradually
[[into]{.mark}]{.underline} increased Taiwanese popular [support
for]{.underline} political [[reunification]{.underline}]{.mark}. Anger
at that strategy's failure led Beijing to revive a campaign to increase
Taiwan's diplomatic isolation by poaching the few small nations that
still maintain formal relations with Taipei. The PRC's menacing military
activities also increased. **[[Chinese war games]{.underline}]{.mark}**
in and around the Taiwan Strait [[have]{.underline}
**[soared]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[since 2016]{.underline}**. The U.S.
Defense Intelligence Agency's 2019 report to Congress also concludes
that [[Beijing is building up its]{.underline}]{.mark} ground, air, and
naval [forces to achieve]{.underline} a **[more robust
[capability]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[to invade
Taiwan]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Anger at Beijing's treatment of Taiwan
has led to congressional and executive branch measures to strengthen
Washington's backing for Taipei. A major step occurred in March 2018
when President Trump signed into law the Taiwan Travel Act (TTA), which
encouraged high-level U.S. officials to meet with their Taiwan
counterparts. That legislation, which passed both houses of Congress,
ended Washington's cautious practice under the Taiwan Relations Act
(TRA) of holding meetings only with relatively low-level Taiwanese
officials. It was especially noticeable that the TTA specifically
promoted interaction by "cabinet-level national security officials."
That provision proved to be more than a symbolic gesture when National
Security Adviser [John [Bolton met with Taiwan]{.mark} National Security
Council Secretary-General David Lee]{.underline} in May. [Bolton's
[intention to push for]{.mark}]{.underline} [stronger [security
ties]{.mark}]{.underline} between the United States and Taiwan
**[[cannot be overstated]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Before his current
stint in government service, [[he pushed for]{.underline}]{.mark} highly
dangerous and **[[provocative policies]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [He
[urged the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to
establish]{.mark}]{.underline} **[formal [diplomatic relations with
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}** and even advocated moving U.S. military
forces from Okinawa to Taiwan. [Either [measure
would]{.mark}]{.underline} cross a bright red line as far as Beijing is
concerned and would likely **[[trigger PRC military
action]{.underline}]{.mark}** to prevent Taiwan's permanent political
separation from the mainland. Having someone with those views holding a
crucial policy post and sitting just a few doors down from the Oval
Office greatly increases the likelihood of a further boost in U.S.
support for Taiwan, despite the risk of war with China. There are
multiple signs from various sources of growing U.S. backing for Taiwan's
de facto independence. **[[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}** certainly
**[[is stepping up]{.mark} its [support]{.mark}]{.underline}**. By a
unanimous voice vote in early May, [the House of Representatives passed
the Taiwan Assurance Act]{.underline}, which expresses firm support for
Taiwan while urging Taipei to increase its own defense spending. [The
[legislation]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[recommends]{.mark} that
[Washington **continue**]{.mark}]{.underline} "regular **[[sales of
defense articles]{.underline}]{.mark}**" to Taiwan and back Taipei's
participation in international organizations---something Beijing
emphatically resists. The Trump administration doesn't seem to need much
prodding. U.S. **[warships have transited the Taiwan
Strait]{.underline}** on several occasions over the past year [to
demonstrate military support for Taipei]{.underline}. At the Shangri-La
Dialogue session, Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan stated
that the United States would no longer "tiptoe around" destabilizing
Chinese behavior regarding Taiwan or the South China Sea. While
Americans are focused on the ongoing trade war between the United States
and China, the danger is growing of an actual shooting war that could
involve Taiwan. [The rhetoric coming out of]{.underline} both [Beijing
and Taipei is]{.underline} increasingly **[confrontational and
shrill]{.underline}**. [Taiwan]{.underline}'s governing party
[is]{.underline} firmly **[committed to resisting the
PRC]{.underline}**'s pressure for unification; indeed, incumbent
president Tsai Ing-wen is being challenged by an even more hardline,
pro-independence faction within the DPP. At the same time, [Chinese
leaders seem intent on pushing]{.underline} their **[reunification
agenda]{.underline}** with greater insistence and urgency. **[Those are
not comforting trends]{.underline}**. [[Washington has
a]{.underline}]{.mark} vague but very [real [commitment under the
T]{.mark}aiwan [R]{.mark}elations [A]{.mark}ct [to **protect the
island**]{.mark}]{.underline}'s security. Both [Congress
and]{.underline} the [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration seem to
be [[drifting toward]{.underline} **[boosting]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[the traditional level of [U.S. support]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
response to Beijing's escalating pressure on Taiwan. The danger is
growing that the TRA's paper security commitment may be put to a
real-world test. U.S. leaders and the American people need to ask
themselves whether they are really willing to risk war with a
nuclear-armed power to protect Taiwan. The prudent answer clearly should
be "no."

#### Absent conciliatory action by the US minor disputes escalate -- the plan is key to establish a cooperative framework that spills over to all other issues

**Swaine 1-16**-2019, Michael D. Swaine has a PhD from Harvard
University, "A Relationship Under Extreme Duress: U.S.-China Relations
at a Crossroads", article "Carnegie Endowment for International Peace",
https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/01/16/relationship-under-extreme-duress-u.s.-china-relations-at-crossroads-pub-78159

Amid this dangerous downward spiral, both [Beijing and Washington have
fewer incentives to]{.underline} undertake meaningful
confidence-building measures, much less [seek]{.underline} out areas of
[mutual accommodation and restraint.]{.underline} On the contrary,
[this]{.underline} state of affairs [inclines both sides to
rely]{.underline} more heavily [on military and]{.underline} other
[coercive means]{.underline} to signal the firmness of their resolve.
[It heightens sensitivities to perceived challenges]{.underline}, both
real and imagined, thereby [increasing the possibility of]{.underline}
truly dangerous [crises]{.underline}, even [over]{.underline} relatively
[minor disputes]{.underline}. The danger of such crises is most evident
in the Western Pacific, where China's growing military and economic
strength and the presence of several volatile [points of
contention]{.underline} between the two powers ([from Korea and Taiwan
to the South China Sea]{.underline}) could [result in]{.underline}
otherwise avoidable [miscalculation]{.underline}s, as each side seeks to
push back against perceived tests of its determination. Indeed, in the
absence of serious and sustained efforts to moderate this current ugly
dynamic, [the chances of a significant political-military crisis in the
not-too-distant future are increasing]{.underline}. This could take many
forms. [Beijing could decide]{.underline} that what it regards as
aggressive [U.S. containment]{.underline} and "pushback" efforts
[justify]{.underline} unprecedented displays of [Chinese determination,
in the form]{.underline}, for example, [of]{.underline} the permanent
deployment of [military forces]{.underline} on its artificial islands
[in the South China Sea]{.underline} and the declaration of a
corresponding air-defense identification zone (ADIZ). For its part,
[Washington could]{.underline} decide that it needs to augment radically
its deterrence capacities regarding Taiwan by [allow]{.underline}ing
U[.S. warships to visit the island on a regular basis]{.underline}.
Worse, it could take steps [to block improvements in cross-strait
relations]{.underline} so as to ensure that a now "strategically
valuable" Taiwan remains separate from mainland China. This would be a
direct violation of Washington's long-standing One China policy that has
ensured peace with Beijing for forty years. [For some misguided
proponents]{.underline} of a supposedly more realistic, adversarial
relationship, s[uch crises would presumably serve a positive
function]{.underline} by strengthening public and elite determination to
push back against the other side. In the U.S., such individuals seem to
believe that only the threat or actual implementation of a complete
disengagement and containment effort against Beijing can generate the
resources and strength of will necessary to prevent China from
dominating the West and destroying the global order. Some advocates of
[this reckless and ill-conceived approach insist]{.underline} that
[its]{.underline} positive [results]{.underline} will
[prevent]{.underline} the emergence of [a new Cold War]{.underline}
environment [by forcing Beijing to submit to U.S. demands.]{.underline}
In truth, [such an approach would]{.underline} almost inevitably
[produce a new Cold War]{.underline}, especially if U.S.-Russia
relations continue to worsen and Sino-Russian relations continue to
improve. And [such an environment would prove far more destructive than
beneficial]{.underline} for all nations concerned. That is largely
[because U.S. and Chinese interests]{.underline} today [are]{.underline}
more compatible, and the fortunes of the two protagonists (and the
world) more [intertwined]{.underline}, than was ever the case during the
original Cold War. Unlike present-day Beijing and Washington, Cold
War--era Russia and the United States were largely separated from one
another economically, culturally, and socially. Few Russians lived and
worked abroad, and few foreigners (beyond those from the Eastern Bloc)
worked and lived in Russia. Moreover, economic exchange between the
United States and the Soviet Union was minimal. Few countries relied
heavily on Russia for prosperity and stability. Unlike Moscow then,
[Beijing]{.underline} today [exerts major]{.underline} and deepening
[influence]{.underline} on countries both in Asia and [around the
globe]{.underline}. [Its]{.underline} economic and technological
[advances are heavily intertwined with]{.underline} many nations in [the
West]{.underline} and beyond, [and its military poses a]{.underline}n
increasingly [credible challenge to U.S. military]{.underline}
predominance [in Asia]{.underline}, as noted above. [The huge potential
risks]{.underline} and dangers inherent in the current situation [are
compounded by the fact that the United States is more insecure, less
confident, more internally divided, and more dependent on the
world]{.underline} now [than]{.underline} it was [during
the]{.underline} height of the [Cold War]{.underline}. As a result, [in
a new Cold War]{.underline}, a [stronger China would]{.underline} be
more likely to [overestimate its ability to outmaneuver]{.underline} and
pressure [the United States]{.underline}. By the same token, [a more
insecure]{.underline} yet still very strong [Washington could prove more
susceptible to overreaction]{.underline} than it was in the face of
Soviet Cold War threats. Taken together, [these factors indicate that
efforts]{.underline} by either or both sides [to isolate]{.underline} or
undermine [the other]{.underline} in the spirit of the Cold War of the
1950s and early 1960s [will produce major dangers for both]{.underline}
countries and other nations. For that reason, many other capitals would
resist [attempts]{.underline} by Washington or Beijing to compel them
[to choose sides in a zero-sum struggle for dominance]{.underline}. [The
resulting disruption would severely undermine the world economy,
\[crush]{.underline}\] ~~cripple~~ [global]{.underline} and regional
[cooperation]{.underline} on many issues, [and impel]{.underline} some
[nations to devote]{.underline} more [resources to military defense
instead of economic development]{.underline}. [The net
result]{.underline} of all this [would be]{.underline} the increased
likelihood of [instability and crisis]{.underline} within nations,
within regions, and ultimately [across the globe.]{.underline}

#### Us-China relations key to prevent war and solve warming

correspondent, is professor emeritus of peace and world-security studies

As Admiral Davidson suggests, one possible outcome of the ongoing cold
war with China could be [[armed conflict of the traditional
sort.]{.mark}]{.underline} Such an encounter, in turn, [[could escalate
to the nuclear level, resulting in mutual
annihilation]{.mark}.]{.underline} A war involving only "conventional"
forces would itself undoubtedly be devastating and lead to widespread
suffering, [[not to mention the collapse of the global
economy]{.underline}.]{.mark} [[Even if]{.underline}]{.mark} a shooting
[[war doesn't erupt]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, a [[long-term
geopolitical war]{.mark}]{.underline} of attrition [[between the US and
China will]{.underline},]{.mark} in the end, have debilitating and
possibly catastrophic consequences for both sides. Take the trade war,
for example. If that's not resolved soon in a positive manner,
continuing high [US tariffs on Chinese imports will severely curb
Chinese economic growth and so weaken the world economy as a whole,
punishing every nation on Earth]{.underline}, including this one. [High
tariffs will also increase costs for American consumers and endanger the
prosperity and survival of many firms that rely on Chinese raw materials
and components.]{.underline} This [[new brand of
war]{.underline}]{.mark} [[will]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[ensure]{.underline}]{.mark} that already sky[[-high defense
expenditures]{.underline}]{.mark} will continue to
[[rise]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[diverting funds from]{.underline}]{.mark}
vital needs [[like education, health, infrastructure, and the
environment]{.underline}]{.mark}. Meanwhile, preparations for a future
war with China have already become the number one priority at the
Pentagon, crowding out all other considerations. "While we're focused on
ongoing operations," acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan
reportedly told his senior staff on his first day in office this
January, "remember China, China, China." Perhaps the [[greatest
victim]{.underline}]{.mark} of this ongoing conflict [[will
be]{.underline}]{.mark} planet [[Earth]{.underline}]{.mark} itself and
all the creatures, humans included, who inhabit it. As the world's top
two emitters of climate-altering greenhouse gases, the [[United States
and China must work together to halt global warming or all of us are
doomed to a hellish future]{.underline}]{.mark}. With a [[war under
way]{.underline}]{.mark}, even a non-shooting one, the [[chance
for]{.underline}]{.mark} such [[collaboration is]{.underline}]{.mark}
essentially [[zero.]{.underline}]{.mark} The [[only way to save
civilization]{.underline}]{.mark} [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} for the [[US
and China to declare peace]{.underline}]{.mark} and focus together on
human salvation.

#### Warming exacerbates the conditions for war\-\--food, water, migration, threat multiplier

**Swain 15** - Department of Peace and Conflict Research, Uppsala
University, Uppsala, Sweden

(Ashok, "Climate Change: Threat to National Security", p1-3,
Encyclopedia of Public Administration and Public Policy, Third Edition)

In the last two decades, many research works have pointed that
[[environmental stress is one **main catalyst** that creates societal
insecurity that may result in armed
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}.\[1--6\] [Not only scarcity of renewable
resources, but also resources scarcity-induced population migration
might become a source of violent conflicts]{.underline} as well.\[7,8\]
However, in recent years, the relationship between climate change and
armed conflict has received more attention. It is often assumed that
climate change will intensify environmental stress and might even create
new conflicts.\[9--14\] The loss of living space and source of
livelihood attributable to climate change could force the affected
people to migrate. Arguably, the mass movement of populations due to
climate change may create security concerns for a nation-state. Climate
change has become a global environmental problem caused by the buildup
of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide and methane, in the
Earth's atmosphere. The world is warming up faster than any time in the
previous 10,000 years. The predicted marked sea level rise caused by
this climatic change may deprive millions of people of their living
space and source of livelihood in the near future. The Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has predicted that sea levels could rise
an average rate of 6 cm per decade over the next century.\[15\] A rise
of this magnitude will no doubt threaten the densely populated low-lying
countries and coastal zones of Asia and Africa and many island states in
the Pacific and Indian Ocean. Not only developing countries, rich
countries like the Netherlands and the south-eastern part of the United
States will also be affected by the sea level rise. Among other
predicted impacts are increases in tropical cyclones. Increased number
of cyclones would also enhance the risk of coastal flooding. Climate
change can also potentially alter the typical rainfall pattern, which
may lead to increased flooding, drought, and soil erosion in tropical
and arid regions of the world. The issue of climate change is high on
the world's policy agenda at present. The controversy over the science
of global warming and the procedures adopted by the IPCC in collecting
data fail to undermine decades of climate research confirming the
overall global climate change. Doubts and denial give way to debates
about the likely impact of climate change, particularly on developing
countries.\[ 16\] Agricultural production may become highly vulnerable
to climate change, given the other multiple stresses that affect food
systems in the South. Response to climate change can also affect
particular societies' cultural norms and social practices related to
food production. Moreover, some countries and societies are better at
formulating adaptation strategies for all aspects of land use practices
to safeguard them against the negative consequences of climate change.
To address the adverse effects of climate change, the effectiveness and
coping abilities of existing institutions matter as well. Within this
context, there is general recognition that the poor in the developing
countries will be the hardest hit by the impacts of climate change, as
they tend to depend more on the natural environment for their
livelihoods and have limited coping mechanisms and adaptive
capacity.\[9\] [Climate change can also potentially increase the number
of poor people by reducing the existing resource base, thereby pulling
more people into poverty.]{.underline} It has also been argued that
[[climate change will **compound** ]{.mark}**the propensity for [violent
conflict]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} particularly in states with weak
governance, poor institutions, and low social capital.]{.underline}
CLIMATE CHANGE AND INSECURITY Climate change has changed the discourse
in international politics, bringing the conservative military security
paradigm into the forefront of the debate. The interstate dimension
clearly dominates this discourse. A major focus of the ongoing
discussion is about the anticipated ice-free Arctic and, thus, the
competition to exploit arctic oilfields. [The]{.underline} other [most
discussed emerging challenge lies in the future of existing
water-sharing agreements because the run-off in many of the river basins
will vary more frequently]{.underline} and severely, because of changing
climate dynamics. Challenges are expected with extreme glacier melting
while, in other regions, droughts and meteorological disasters are the
major threats. [The [geopolitical dimensions]{.mark} and military
security consequences [of climate change pose a **severe challenge to
interstate relations**]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, it is the adverse
impact on human security of a large number of nations is most worrying.
[A critical component of human security is food security, which is going
to be seriously affected through the multiple impacts of climate
change.]{.underline} [The [agriculture]{.mark} sector [is **very
sensitive**]{.mark} to changes in climate]{.underline}. [Climate change
will consequently lead to more frequent extreme weather events
particularly in arid and tropical regions, such as droughts and floods,
eventually affecting agricultural productivity and likely leading to
**food shortages and societal insecurity**]{.underline}.\[17\] [[Sea
level rise]{.underline}]{.mark} has posed a serious threat to the
survival of some of the smaller island states. But it also [threatens
the sources of livelihood for millions of people that live in low-lying
river deltas in poor developing countries]{.underline}. Rich and
developed states might be able to mitigate the impact of rising sea
levels to some extent, for instance, London with the Thames Barrier.
Others rich countries have long experience with seawater intrusion,
e.g., Netherlands, which shields parts of its inland through the
Oosterscheldekering (Eastern Scheldt Storm Surge Barrier). But, [the
situation is **quite precarious** for poor developing
countries.]{.underline} CLIMATE CHANGE AND CONFLICTS **[[Conflicts will
increase owing to]{.mark} the impact of [climate
change]{.mark}]{.underline}**, though not through a direct singular
causal mechanism. The debate, which evolved prominently during the
1990s, frequently refers to [population migration as one of the key
linking points between climate change and armed conflict]{.underline}.
[[The anticipated increase in]{.mark} the number of climate change
[migrants will]{.mark} cause stress on receiving communities, which
might themselves suffer under resource stress, and, thus, eventually
[lead to]{.mark} new [security problems]{.mark} through increased
competition]{.underline}.\[5,7\] Some preliminary [[research finds
**quantifiable connections**]{.mark} between climate change and
organized communal violence]{.underline}.\[ 18\] [Raleigh]{.underline}
and Kniveton\[19\] [**confirm** the trend of high rainfall leading to
increased risk of localized communal conflict]{.underline}. However, the
findings indicate that [combination of socioeconomic and political
factors with climate change factors lead to conflict]{.underline}. The
discussion regarding the causal relationship between climate change and
conflicts has yet to produce consensus.\[16\] On the basis of the
existing literature, it can be safely argued that climate change may not
generate conflicts in itself, but that [[climate change can]{.mark}, and
in some instances already does, [act as a "**threat
multiplier**."]{.mark}]{.underline} CLIMATE CHANGE AND WATER CONFLICTS
[As climate change can potentially change water supply and demand
patterns, sharing of [scarce water resources]{.mark} of shared rivers
systems in the arid and semiarid regions [will become the **most likely
security challenges**]{.mark} in the near future]{.underline}. Climate
science has been able to provide a basic understanding of how the
hydrological cycle will change at the global level, but the predictions
of water demand and supplies at the regional and basin level is still
far from reaching some sort of consensus. [It is a **fact** that the
projected impacts of global climate change over fresh water may be huge
and marked]{.underline}, but they will not take shape on the same scale
in each and every geographical region. Even within an international
river basin, the effects will vary depending on the location.
[[This]{.mark} further **[enhances]{.mark} the [uncertainties and
anxieties]{.mark}** [over]{.mark} the [water availability]{.mark} in the
shared river systems]{.underline}. Unfortunately, as Eckstein rightly
points out, "[both domestic and international water laws and policies
are inadequate to meet the challenges posed by this global phenomenon or
to adapt to the additional **consequences that appear to be
inevitable**]{.underline}."\[20\] Existing water-sharing arrangements
between the riparian countries of international rivers in most cases
provide some mechanisms to adjust to the run-off variability while
agreeing on allocation of fixed quota of water. Usually, the regular
water-sharing agreements tend to be based upon the assumption that any
resulting shortages will be for a short duration only and that they can
address the issue with temporary reallocation methods.\[21\] However,
climate change not only can bring long-term increases or decreases to
the average run-off of the river system, it can also influence the
variability of those flows that require flexibility to be the part of
the water-sharing framework to cope with emerging situations.\[22\] As
global climate change brings long-term changes to the volume and pattern
of run-off in shared river systems, it becomes crucial to examine the
suitability of existing agreements to address this challenge.
Climate-related changes might require comprehensive adjustments in the
ongoing water management structure of international rivers.\[ 23\] There
is no doubt that climate change poses extreme challenges to water
resource management in international river basins in the South.\[24\]
Maarten De Wit and Jacek Stankiewicz\[25\] demonstrate the marked
potential effects of relatively small changes in rainfall due to climate
change over the perennial drainage of the river. Moreover, climate
change might cause extreme weather events, water shortages, changing sea
levels, or melting glaciers that can generate serious threats to
critical river water management infrastructure. While the importance of
adjustment of flow variability in water sharing is crucial, many of the
existing provisions within agreements are not adequate enough to meet
the scenarios that global climate change models project. They lack
enforcement and are generally dependent upon "ideal" riparian behavior
in case of eventuality. However, this approach may overcome run-off
deficits in the short term, but climate change poses the risk of
long-term flow reduction that would severely test existing provisions.
CLIMATE "REFUGEES" AND CONFLICTS The predicted marked sea level rise
caused by this climatic change may take away the living space and source
of livelihood of millions of people in the near future. The IPCC has
predicted that sea levels could rise an average rate of 6 cm per decade
over the next century. A rise of this magnitude will no doubt threaten
densely populated low-lying countries and coastal zones and many small
island countries. Among the other impacts, there could be an increase in
tropical cyclones. Increased cyclones would also enhance the risk of
coastal flooding. Climate change can also potentially alter the usual
rainfall pattern, which may lead to increased flooding, drought, and
soil erosion in tropical and arid regions of the world. The problem of
climate change-induced population migration ranks as one of the foremost
crises of our times. To date, however, [these people]{.underline} have
been viewed as a peripheral concern. But, their [sheer size has now
brought them into the fore as one of the most important issues on the
global political agenda. Large-scale transborder [migration has
**several dimensions for inducing conflict**]{.mark} between the
receiver and sender states]{.underline}. In some cases, giving
permission to the migrants to enter into its own territory may strain
the relationship between the receiving state and the sender country. The
[tension may arise from the exposure of the sender's inability to handle
the migration crisis by itself, or the sender may suspect or allege that
the receiving country is encouraging the migration]{.underline}. The
other possibility is that the [[migrants]{.underline}]{.mark}, after
being settled in the host country, [[may indulge themselves in
antigovernment activities against their native government]{.mark}, which
they may perceive as the perpetrator of their plight]{.underline}. [The
new location]{.underline}, physical proximity, and protection from the
former regime's retribution [can provide a good opportunity for them to
take revenge]{.underline}. In some cases, the [[migrants may be
encouraged or be manipulated]{.mark} by the host state in their effort
[to take revenge]{.mark} because of existing political differences
between the host and the sender states. [This will]{.mark} **of course
[result in creating negative implications for]{.mark} regional
[security]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\[7\] CONCLUSION [Although climate
change may not be the sole cause of conflict or large-scale population
migration, it is considered a threat multiplier]{.underline}.\[13,26\]
Social, economic, and political factors will also affect the
vulnerability or resilience of communities. In most of the developing
countries, the ability to cope with climate change decreases, and the
likelihood of conflict increases, as a result of factors that include
[poverty]{.underline}, low levels of education/[literacy]{.underline},
lack of skills, weak [institutions]{.underline}, limited
[infrastructure]{.underline}, lack of [technology]{.underline} and
information, limited access to [health]{.underline} [care]{.underline},
poor access to [resources]{.underline}, overexploitation of resources,
etc. [Climate change is likely to exacerbate many of these
problems]{.underline}.

over [[the \"One China\" policy]{.mark}.]{.underline} Last week, Reuters
reported that [Washington was on its way to approving \$2 billion worth

challenged that notion repeatedly. Despite protests from Beijing, Trump
signed the Taiwan Travel Act, legislation permitting high-level talks
between US and Taiwanese officials, last year. In May, the US national

security officials. This meeting came just after Taiwan renamed its
unofficial embassy in Washington the Taiwan Council for US Affairs. The

becoming more and more expensive. And though it does not include the
US\'s top fighter jets, it is sure to antagonize Beijing before the G20
meeting at the end of the month in Osaka, Japan, where US and Chinese
heads of state are expected to meet. On Thursday, a Chinese Foreign
Ministry representative, [[Geng Shuang, responded]{.underline}]{.mark}
to the news of the arms sale with a warning, according to the Chinese
state media outlet Xinhua. \"[[We urge the US side to stop arms sales to

January 2017, [China]{.underline} --- most likely [aware]{.underline}
that the incoming [US president was unfamiliar with]{.underline} the
[complexities of US-China relations]{.underline} --- [clarified its
position]{.underline} on Taiwan in a rare US media interview by the

started in 1949 after the Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek left the

China policy and China\'s economic nationalism are tied together in the
Chinese political imagination. That may seem foreign to the US, where
one set of technocrats handles economics and another handles national
security, but the merging of the two interests are a response to the
China\'s lost century. And both are being tested by the Trump
administration. While the US-China trade war producing a \" tech Cold

that the conflict has all the trappings of the Cold War era. China sees
US interference in Taiwan as an encroachment on its sphere of influence.
And the US sees Chinese involvement in the Caribbean similarly. Back in
February 2018 after a speech in Texas, then-Secretary of State Rex
Tillerson warned Latin American nations of China\'s \"imperial\"
ambitions, invoking the Monroe Doctrine. \"Latin America does not need
new imperial powers that seek only to benefit their own people,\" he
said. \"China\'s state-led model of development is reminiscent of the

dropped its recognition of Taiwan at China\'s behest. El Salvador did it
in 2018, and Panama in 2017. There may be a Cold War-reminiscent
motivation behind this arms sale as well. Taiwan\'s anti-China
president, Tsai Ing-wen, faces an uphill battle for reelection next
year. [In Washington the sale may be seen as a way to bolster her
chances of winning.]{.underline} \"One thing US administrations tend to
think, which may or may not be true,\" Thornton said, \"is that selling
weapons to Taiwan helps political candidates show that they have US

### Yes Arms Sales Key 

#### Increase of arms sales to Taiwan strains U.S. -- China relations

More Than \$2 Billion in Weapons Sales to Taiwan, Angering Beijing ,\"

WASHINGTON---The [U.S. is planning a new effort to help the Taiwanese
government upgrade its military]{.underline} by allowing Taipei to buy
billions of dollars' worth of weapons systems, possibly including more
than 100 tanks---a move that has [already drawn criticism from
Beijing]{.underline}. Washington [is legally obliged under the Taiwan
Relations Act of 1979 to help the self-ruled island access defensive
weapons]{.underline}, but such transactions are bitterly [opposed by
Beijing]{.underline}, which considers Taiwan a breakaway province. A
[[new]{.mark} round of [weapons sales]{.mark} [to Taipe]{.mark}i would
also [risk]{.mark} further [inflaming tensions between the U.S. and
China]{.mark} as the two countries remain locked in a trade
fight.]{.underline} Multiple people familiar with the weapons-sales plan
told The Wall Street Journal that members of Congress have been
informally notified of the possible arms sale. Ultimately, the Taiwanese
government would have the option to buy some or all of the items
included in the proposal, these people said. Reuters earlier reported
the [[potential sale,]{.mark} which includes Abrams tanks, antitank
missiles, medium-range tactical missiles and portable Stinger
air-defense missiles. The [value]{.mark} could be in [excess of \$2
billion]{.mark}.]{.underline} A State Department official, citing U.S.
government policy on potential or pending arms sales, declined to
comment on or confirm the terms before formal congressional
notification. A representative of the Taiwanese government declined to
comment beyond a Ministry of National Defense statement confirming its
request for the weapon systems, in accordance with U.S. procedures for
foreign military sales. In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
Geng Shuang said "[[China]{.mark} firmly, consistently and unequivocally
[opposes U.S. arms sales to Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}." He said he
[[urged]{.mark} Washington to recognize the sensitive nature of the
matter, honor the One China policy and [halt]{.mark} any U.S. arms sales
[to]{.mark} or military [relations with Taiwan]{.mark}.]{.underline}
China and Taiwan have been governed separately since 1949, when China's
Nationalist government retreated to the island after it was ousted from
the mainland by Communist Party forces. The [U.S. officially adheres to
the One China policy, meaning Washington won't establish formal
diplomatic relations with Taipei]{.underline}, but the [[U.S. and Taiwan
view]{.mark} the sales [as crucial for stability]{.mark} in the
region]{.underline}. President Trump approved a \$1.42 billion arms sale
in 2017, and the Obama administration approved a similar transfer in
2015. With [Beijing and Washington at a critical point in the
high-stakes trade negotiations, new weapons sales could become a
complicating factor in the dispute.]{.underline} President Trump warned
Beijing on Thursday about another potential tariff increase on Chinese
goods if negotiators fail to reach a deal. China's Commerce Ministry
reiterated that Beijing wouldn't shy away from responding to any U.S.
escalation, though said it is not seeking a trade war.

[Given the tensions]{.underline}---and the anger in Beijing---that are
[generated by US arms sales to Taiwan,]{.underline} some in the United
States [propose that Washington end (or at least scale back) weapons
sales to the island.]{.underline} Doing so, proponents suggest, [would
remove a major irritant in the US-China relationship and would increase
trust and cooperation in bilateral relations]{.underline}.6 More
fundamentally, proponents of a reduced US commitment to Taiwan suggest
that such a policy approach [would help lower the risk of armed conflict
in East Asia]{.underline}. This argument is developed most fully by
Charles Glaser,7 who suggests that ending the US commitment to defend
Taiwan would bring with it two significant benefits for the US-China
relationship. First, it [could improve US-China relations because such a
shift in US policy would remove a key source of mistrust in Beijing
concerning US motivations]{.underline}. Second, [ending US support for
Taiwan---by removing the key potential source of military conflict
between China and the United States---would reduce military competition
between Washington and Beijing.]{.underline} Glaser thus proposes a
"[grand bargain]{.underline}," in which the [United States]{.underline}
would [end its commitment to Taiwan in return for Chinese willingness to
"resolve its maritime disputes on 'fair' terms" and to accept a
long-term US security presence in East Asia.]{.underline} Others argue
that the US commitment to Taiwan is increasingly untenable as China's
military power continues to grow. For instance, Chas Freeman warns that
a continued US commitment to Taiwan is incompatible with (a) waning US
relative power in the region and (b) the importance that the PRC places
on the issue. A [failure to accommodate US policy]{.underline} to new
geopolitical realities, in turn, [risks future military conflict over an
issue about which China cares deeply.]{.underline}8 John Mearsheimer
argues along similar lines that China's rise as a great power, if it
continues, will mean that the current US security commitment to Taiwan
will be increasingly unsustainable

#### Ending Arms Sales to Taiwan would foster peaceful relations b/w U.S. and China---multiple warrants---FIRE!!!

**Zurong 13** (Wu Zurong, April 02 2013, "Is it Time to Stop Arms Sales
to Taiwan?", Wu is a Research Fellow at the China Foundation for

Since ancient times, Taiwan has been the territory of China. Oddly
enough[, [Taiwan has]{.mark} always [been an obstacle to the stable
development of Sino-US relations since]{.mark}]{.underline} the birth of
the People's Republic of China (PRC) in October of
[[1949]{.underline}]{.mark}. The peaceful development of relations
across the Taiwan Straits since 2008 is helping remove this obstacle[.
[It is]{.mark} high [time now]{.mark} [for the US
to]{.mark}]{.underline} seize the opportunity and make up its mind to
stop interfering in China's internal affairs[, [stop arms sales to
Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark} and stop overt and covert official contact
with Taiwan. The [[Taiwan issue]{.underline}]{.mark} is a remnant of
history. For the last 60 years or more, it [[has been the single most
important and most sensitive issue at the heart of Sino-US
relations]{.underline}]{.mark}. In a certain sense, the failure to
seriously discuss and resolve this issue has contributed to the 22 years
of estrangement and hostility experienced between China and the US. When
President Nixon made his historic visit to China [[in 1972, Taiwan had
been a central issue in the negotiations for normalization of
relations]{.underline}]{.mark} between China and the United States. On
January 1, 1979, China and the US established full diplomatic relations
when the Carter Administration decided to sever diplomatic relations
with Taiwan, withdraw American troops and military installations from
Taiwan, and to abrogate the treaties it had signed with Taiwan. In a
word, resolution of the Taiwan issue was key to normalization. Now[,
[with peaceful development established in cross-Straits relations,
assumed threats to Taiwan are diminishing and there is no apparent
danger to US interests]{.mark}]{.underline}. Therefore, the Taiwan
Relations Act is now completely out of date. The US has expressed
support for the continued expansion of exchanges and cooperation between
the two sides of the Taiwan Straits as it is not only in the interests
of the people of both sides of the Straits, but also helps maintain
peace and stability in the region. With the establishment of peace
prevailing across the Taiwan Straits, [[US arms sales to Taiwan have not
only become unreasonable but also unnecessary]{.mark}. [Taiwan's needs
for weapons are on the decline]{.mark}. The [arms sold to Taiwan are
used to protect Taiwan's fishing boats]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
Diaoyu Islands' territorial waters. It would be ridiculous if the US
insists on arms sales to Taiwan when the US officially insists on the
peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue. Under the current situation,
[[the US decision **to completely terminate arms sales to Taiwan would
be a wise choice**. Stopping interference in China's internal
affairs]{.underline}]{.mark} by terminating US arms sales to and
official contact with Taiwan [**[does not mean the US is "giving up
Taiwan]{.mark}**." [It only means that the **US has come to truly abide
by the principles and the spirit of the three joint
communiqués**]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[greatly [helping to enhance US
credibility and strengthen mutual political trust between China and the
US]{.mark}]{.underline}**. At the same time, it is believed that
[[nonofficial contact and exchanges by the US with
Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}, whether cultural, economic or business,
[[will continue to flourish on a solid basis in the peaceful environment
across the Taiwan Straits]{.mark}.]{.underline} 

### Yes Arms Sales Key -- Experts 

#### Yes---ending US arms sales to Taiwan would better US-China Relations---many experts agree\--

**Lin and Zhou 18** (Gang Lin, Wenxing Zhou, August 2018, "Does Taiwan
matter to the United States? Policy Debates on Taiwan Abandonment and
Beyond", China Review, Harvard University PhD student and does research

Although the status quo maintainers still belong to the mainstream in
the United States, [[many Americans have begun to rethink the Taiwan
issue in U.S.-China relations.]{.mark} Among them [some experts argue
for the policy of Taiwan abandonment with various degrees]{.mark},
either [for the sake of U.S.-China cooperation (e.g., Owens, Gilley,
Kent, Freeman), avoiding military conflict with China (Carpenter and
Glaser),]{.mark}]{.underline} or acknowledgments of the greater trend of
China's eventual reunification (e.g., Shambaugh, Prueher, Swaine,
Sutter, McDevitt, Brzezinski or Mearsheimer). Unlike Washington's tacit
acceptance of Taiwan's unification with the mainland for working with
the PRC to counterbalance against the Soviet Union in the 1970s and
early 1980s, [the [argument that Taiwan has to or should be abandoned
advocated openly in unofficial views in recent years have aroused more
public attention]{.mark}]{.underline} and therefore more criticisms and
reactions from status quo maintainers and the "Cold War minders." It
remains empirically underexplored to what extent these debates over
Taiwan abandonment will shape U.S. policy toward the Taiwan Strait.
[[Drawing on interactions among Beijing, Washington and Taipei over the
past decades, the answer to the question is often a big
yes]{.underline}]{.mark}, evidenced by policy adjustments following
policy debates and their impact on the future trend of U.S.-Taiwan
relations. It is clear that arguments of Taiwan abandonment between 2009
and 2014 are coincided with increasing U.S.- China cooperation and
smoothly peaceful development of cross-Strait relations. The growing but
limited tensions in both U.S.-China relations and domestic politics of
Taiwan in the late years of the Obama administration may have increased
the incentive and faith for Taiwan watchers in the United States who
want to maintain the status quo and even play the Taiwan card. This may
explain the decreasing voice of Taiwan abandonment in the last couple of
years of the Obama administration.

The United States on Sept. 24 announced a new set of arms sales to
Taiwan. Valued at \$330 million, this sale comprises [mainly spare parts
and
equipment](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/2165609/us-announces-new-taiwan-arms-deal-worth-us330-million)
to support Taiwan's air force, including its F-16s and C-130s. This
marks the second major arms sale to Taiwan by the Trump administration,
following [a \$1.4 billion sale in June]{.underline} 2017 that [included
long-range missiles and heavy torpedoes]{.underline}. Not surprisingly,
[Beijing promptly denounced the sale]{.underline}. The Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman
[declared](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/t1598615.shtml)
that "[the U.S. arms sales to Taiwan severely violates the international
law \[and\] the basic norms governing international
relations]{.underline}." The Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman
[warned](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-09/25/c_137492304.htm)
that the [U.S. move severely violated U.S.-China relations]{.underline},
"interfered with China's domestic affairs [and harmed China's
sovereignty and security interests, and seriously damaged China-U.S.
ties]{.underline}, relations between the two militaries, [as well as
peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait]{.underline}." The arms
sales announcement came not only amid another round of tariffs in the
slowly escalating trade clashes between the United States and China, but
also right after the U.S. imposed sanctions against the Chinese People's
Liberation Army (PLA).

#### Arms sales heighten political climate

**Xia 4-17**-2019, Li Xia has a PhD from Tsinghua University,
"Commentary: U.S. Arms Sales to Taiwan a Dangerous Move to Aggravate
Cross-Strait Situation", article "Xinhua Net", \[6/26/2019\],
http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-04/17/c_137985601.htm

[The U.S. arms sale plan]{.underline} unveiled Monday [is a dangerous
move that will only aggravate the already complex and grim situation
across the Taiwan Strait. The U.S. government]{.underline} has
[approved]{.underline} a possible [500-million-U.S. dollar military sale
to Taiwan]{.underline}, claiming that the move will help to improve the
security and defensive capability of the recipient. Subsequently, Taiwan
leader Tsai Ing-wen expressed \"gratitude,\" saying that the arms sale
was \"timely.\" [The situation across the Taiwan Strait,]{.underline}
which is already complicated and grim, [is worsening as the United
States has been using Taiwan to contain China]{.underline} while the
Taiwan administration kept seeking foreign intervention. The Taiwan
question concerns [China\'s]{.underline} sovereignty and [territorial
integrity]{.underline} and [is the most important and sensitive issue in
China-U.S. relations.]{.underline} The [U.S. arms sales]{.underline} to
Taiwan [constitutes a serious violation of international law,
th]{.underline}e basic norms governing [international relations, the
one-China principle and the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and
undermine China\'s sovereignty and security interests. China\'s firm
opposition to such arms sales is consistent and firm.]{.underline} Since
the current U.S. administration took office, it has constantly played
the \"Taiwan card\" to contain China, especially in [arms
sales]{.underline} to Taiwan and military exchanges between the United
States and Taiwan. This [has seriously damaged China-U.S. relations and
jeopardized peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.]{.underline}
The Taiwan question, which concerns China\'s core interests and the
national bond of the Chinese people, brooks no external interference.
The [U.S.]{.underline} administration has once again [stirred
up]{.underline} sensitive nerves in [the Taiwan Strait.]{.underline} Its
gross [interference]{.underline} in China\'s internal affairs [has
aroused]{.underline} the strong [indignation of the Chinese people on
both sides of the Strait.]{.underline} Some Taiwan organizations and
people protested outside the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) in
Taipei, condemning U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and demanding \"no war,
only peace,\" and \"Taiwan is not a pawn for the United States.\"
Therefore, [we]{.underline} would like to [advise the U.S. side to
clearly recognize the high sensitivity and serious harm of arms sales to
Taiwan, correct mistakes]{.underline}, honor its commitments [and handle
Taiwan-related issues]{.underline} in a prudent and proper manner in
accordance with the one-China principle and the provisions of the three
Sino-U.S. joint communiques. Taiwan\'s current Democratic Progressive
Party ([DPP)]{.underline} administration, which is teetering on the
brink of collapse, [was overjoyed at the U.S. arms sales as if it had
been given a \"straw to save its life]{.underline}.\" Tsai Ing-wen and
[the DPP]{.underline} administration [have escalated provocations
against the Chinese mainland]{.underline}, created disturbances recently
and cooperated with the United States in vigorously clamoring the
so-called \"military threat\" from the mainland. In the face of next
year\'s general election on the island, Tsai and [the DPP will not
hesitate to let Taiwan serve as a pawn]{.underline} for forces of
external interference [in order to protect their power, regardless of
the safety and well-being of the Taiwanese people.]{.underline} This
party has not only misjudged the situation but also deviated from the
people\'s heart. [U.S. weapons **cannot** guarantee Taiwan\'s
security]{.underline}. Tsai and [the DPP cannot secure their power and
position by seeking foreign interference or threatening the
people.]{.underline} Tsai, [the DPP]{.underline} and \"Taiwan
independence\" separatist elements [should not play with fire or even
think about it.]{.underline} They are doomed to be alone in the face of
the pressure of their own actions. On April 17, 124 years ago, [the
Treaty of Shimonoseki]{.underline} was signed, [securing foreigner\'s
occupation of Taiwan for half a century]{.underline}. It [left lasting,
painful memories for all Chinese.]{.underline} Today\'s China will never
allow the historical tragedy of national division to repeat itself.
**[No one]{.underline}** and no force [should underestimate the
**determination** and **capability** of the Chinese in safeguarding
national sovereignty and territorial integrity.]{.underline}

[Beijing has accused Washington of violating the one-China principle
with its recent sale of a US\$500 million military package to Taiwan,
saying the act seriously hurt relations between the two countries and
jeopardised stability in the Taiwan Strait.]{.underline} "[The Chinese
side]{.underline} resolutely [opposes]{.underline} any countries
[selling weapons to Taiwan]{.underline}," the defence ministry said in a
statement on Wednesday, while repeating its position that it regards the
self-ruled island as an inalienable part of the mainland and its need to
uphold its territorial integrity. The latest deal with Taipei, which
includes a pilot training programme and maintenance/logistics support
for F-16 aircraft in Arizona, is the third since US President Donald
Trump approved arms sales to the island in 2017. It was announced by the
Defence Security Cooperation Agency, part of the US Department of
Defence, on April 15. "What [the US]{.underline} side did not only
strongly [violated]{.underline} the [one-China]{.underline} principle
[and the three communiques]{.underline} prescribing Sino-US relations,
[but]{.underline} [also interfered in China's internal affairs and
damaged the sovereignty and security of China]{.underline}," the defence
ministry statement said. [The act]{.underline} also "[poisoned bilateral
military ties and seriously sabotaged cross-strait relations and
stability in the Taiwan Strait]{.underline}", it said. [Beijing
demanded]{.underline} that [Washington]{.underline} uphold the one-China
principle and [stop supplying arms to Taiwan]{.underline} and engaging
in military contact with it.

#### New US-Taiwan conference arrangements aggravate China 

**Lawrence Chung 18** ( Lawrence Chung, 2/20/2018, Covers Major

Retaliations with defense talks on Taiwan, Chinese Analysts warn",

[A]{.underline}nother [potential flashpoint for Sino-US relations
is]{.underline} looming with [plans for Taiwan to host a conference with
American defence industry representatives]{.underline} for the first
time in 16 years, mainland Chinese analysts have warned. The annual
US-Taiwan defence industry conference has long been a platform for
Taiwan and the United States to discuss arms sales and has been held in
the US for the last decade-and-a-half to avoid provoking Beijing, which
claims sovereignty over the island. But a Taiwanese military source
confirmed to the *South China Morning Post* on Tuesday that Taipei and
[Washington agreed]{.underline} last year that from 2018, [they would
take turns to host]{.underline} the event and [the
conference]{.underline} would now take place twice a year. [The move is
set to provoke Beijing and aggravate tensions]{.underline} in Sino-US
ties brought on by US President Donald Trump's decision in December to
sign the National Defence Authorisation Act strengthening military ties
with Taipei. In addition, the Taiwan Travel Act, which would allow US
officials at all levels to travel to Taiwan to meet their counterparts
on the island, will soon be sent the floor of the Senate for passage
after clearing the House of Representatives. Hu Benliang, a Taiwan
affairs specialist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the
US was "using Taiwan as a tool to contain China". Hu said that if the
travel act passed and the US sent senior officials to the conference, it
would risk "sending the wrong signals" to Taiwanese President Tsai
Ing-wen that the US encouraged Taiwanese independence. He also said
endorsement of the travel act would likely prompt retaliation from
Beijing, such as more frequent "island encirclement" patrols near
Taiwan. Liu Guoshen, head of Xiamen University's Taiwan Research
Institute, warned: "If this becomes the pretext for allowing formal
exchanges \[between the US and Taiwan\], it would seriously undermine
the stability of Sino-US [relations." The US-Taiwan Business Council,
which has organised the conferences since 2002, said earlier this month
that it "looks forward to working with the TW-DIDA \[Taiwan Defence
Industry Development Association\] on a separate defence delegation and
seminar in Taiwan this spring". The Taiwanese military source said the
conference would be held in Taiwan "in the first half of this year". But
instead of discussing Taipei's weapons wish list, the Taiwan meeting
would focus on technical exchanges between defence manufacturers from
the two sides. "The discussions on arms issues and defence industry
cooperation will be left to the conference to be held in the US in the
second half of this year]{.underline}," the source said. In Beijing,
spokesmen for the foreign and defence ministries were not available for
comment because of a public holiday. But state-run mainland tabloid
*Global Times* reported last month that Taiwan and the US would pay the
price for their high-level exchanges should the travel act become law.
Wang Kung-yi, a political-science professor at the Chinese Culture
University in Taipei, said that if the travel act became law soon, it
was very likely that the US would send senior officials to Taiwan with
the arms sellers. Wang also said that Taiwan's hosting of the conference
would be a boost to Tsai's ambitions for the island to develop its own
defence industry. "Tsai is keen to develop shipbuilding, aerospace and
information security in Taiwan. [Having major US arms suppliers at the
conference would be a]{.underline} definite [plus for]{.underline} her
[policy]{.underline}," Wang said. Last year, [the US pledged to sell
Taiwan US\$1.42 billion in arms, the first such sale under Trump's
administration.]{.underline}

[The decision]{.underline} by the United States [to sell arms to
Taiwan]{.underline} was "wrong" and [violated a consensus
reached]{.underline} when Chinese President Xi Jinping met US President
Donald Trump [at Mar-a-Lago]{.underline} in April, Beijing told
Washington. The announcement of the US\$1.4 billion deal comes a week
ahead of Xi's planned meeting with Trump on the sidelines of the G20
summit in Hamburg, Germany. [China's ambassador]{.underline} to
Washington, Cui Tanika, [told reporters that China firmly opposed the
deal]{.underline}. "We have expressed firm opposition to the US and we
will reserve our right to take further action," Cui told reporters at an
event in Washington to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong's
handover to China. A statement issued later by the Chinese embassy in
Washington DC [criticized the move as a breach of the consensus reached
between the two leaders at their first]{.underline} ever
[meeting]{.underline}. "The wrong move of [the US side runs
counter]{.underline} to [the]{.underline} consensus reached by the two
presidents in Mar-a-Lago and the [positive development momentum of the
China-US relationship]{.underline}," it's said. The arms sales package
was announced by a US State Department spokeswoman on Thursday. It
comprises seven items, including technical support for early warning
radar, anti-radiation missiles, torpedoes and components for SM-2
missiles, Associated Press reported.

The complicated relationship between the United States, the People's
Republic of China and Taiwan has been heating up. In recent months[,
China flexed some muscle by sending strategic bombers to circumnavigate
Taiwan]{.underline}. In March, President Trump
[signed](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-taiwan-china/trump-signs-u-s-taiwan-travel-bill-angering-china-idUSKCN1GS2SN)
the [Taiwan Travel
Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/535), which
calls for higher-level visits between the United States and Taiwan. The
United States has been considering [naval port
calls](http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201712140016.aspx) to Taiwan,
something that hasn't happened since the 1970s. [The possibility of
closer U.S.-Taiwan ties, in turn, has led to [strong
criticism](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/josh-rogin/wp/2017/10/12/china-threatens-u-s-congress-for-crossing-its-red-line-on-taiwan/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.8af2a1084ad7)
from the Chinese government]{.underline}. To make sense of these events,
here's what you need to know about U.S.-China-Taiwan relations: 1)
Taiwan's sovereign status is the big issue --- but the issue has
evolved. In 1949, at the end of the Chinese civil war, the losing
Nationalists (and their government, the Republic of China) retreated to
Taiwan. The victorious Communists established the People's Republic of
China in Beijing. Each government viewed itself as the legitimate
government of China, each viewed Taiwan as a part of China, and each
viewed national unification as an important goal. Beijing's bottom line
in 2018 remains unchanged: Taiwan is a part of China and must be unified
with the rest of the country. In Taiwan, reestablishing Republic of
China authority over all of China long remained a Nationalist goal and
questioning this aspiration was strictly off-limits under the martial
law in place until 1987. Today, however, the Republic of China has
evolved into a full-fledged democracy, and the idea that Taiwan is a
part of China is openly contested on the island. Most residents
currently [self-identify as
Taiwanese](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/01/02/yes-taiwan-wants-one-china-but-which-china-does-it-want/?utm_term=.86605f3596e2)
rather than as Chinese. While the Nationalist Party still pays lip
service (via the "[1992
consensus](http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201507190019.aspx)") to the
idea of Taiwan belonging to a greater "[one
China](https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21718499-polite-fiction-there-only-one-china-has-kept-peace-east-asiabut-now-it),"
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party does not. 2) The United States
does not recognize the ROC government --- but also doesn't recognize
Taiwan as a part of China. For decades after 1949, the United States
recognized the Republic of China, not the People's Republic of China, as
the government of China. This [changed in
1979](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1977-1980/china-policy), when
Washington and Beijing established official diplomatic relations and the
United States broke ties with the Republic of China. The United States
today maintains extensive --- [but
unofficial](https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35855.htm) --- ties with
Taiwan. Although the United States recognizes the People's Republic of
China as the sole legal government of China, Washington does not accept
the view of the People's Republic of China that Taiwan is a part of
China. Rather, the United States merely
"[acknowledges](https://www.ait.org.tw/our-relationship/policy-history/key-u-s-foreign-policy-documents-region/u-s-prc-joint-communique-1979/)"
the Chinese position on this issue. 3) Chinese leaders face difficult
trade-offs in their Taiwan policy. The People's Republic of China uses
both carrots and sticks to deal with Taiwan. Beijing sometimes uses
threats and coercion to deter Taiwan independence and to advance the
goal of unification[. The recent strategic bomber missions, along with
[increased](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-03/china-objects-to-taiwanese-delegates-in-perth-diamond-meeting/8494370)
efforts to[isolate Taiwan
internationally](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/world/asia/taiwan-world-health-china-.html),
are in part meant to punish Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen for [not
accepting](https://www.wsj.com/articles/taiwans-new-president-skirts-one-china-consensus-in-inaugural-address-1463723943)
that Taiwan is a part of China]{.underline}. More generally, [China
doesn't want Taiwan to feel comfortable with a status quo where progress
isn't being made on
[unification](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/20/asia/taiwan-china-xi-jinping-intl/index.html).]{.underline}
Beijing hopes to convince Taiwanese voters that they'd be better off
supporting the Nationalist Party, whose position on Taiwan's status is
more palatable to China. Tough actions also reassure nationalists in
China that their government remains resolute on the Taiwan issue.

### Ending Arms Sales Key to Relations 

#### ending arms sales to Taiwan solves US-China relations and South China Sea tension

sources say, angering China," Nasdaq, 6/6/19. D.A. 6/25/19

WASHINGTON, June 5 (Reuters) - [The United States is pursuing the sale
of more than \$2 billion worth of tanks and weapons to Taiwan, four
people familiar with the negotiations said, sparking anger from Beijing
which is already involved in an escalating trade war with
Washington.]{.underline} An informal notification of the proposed sale
has been sent to the U.S. Congress, the four sources said on condition
of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the
possible deal. [**The United States is the main arms supplier to
Taiwan**, which China deems its own and has never renounced the use of
force to bring the self-ruled island under its control. Taiwan President
Tsai Ing-wen said in March Washington was responding positively to
Taipei\'s requests for new arms sales to bolster its defenses in the
face of pressure from China. The United States has no formal ties with
Taiwan but is bound by law to help provide it with the means to defend
itself. China and the United States are engaged in a fierce trade war,
with clashes over **Taiwan and the South China Sea exacerbating
tensions.**]{.underline} A spokesman for the State Department, which
oversees foreign military sales, said the U.S. government does not
comment on or confirm potential or pending arms sales or transfers
before they have been formally notified to Congress. The congressional
notifications included a variety of anti-tank munitions, including 409
Raytheon Co and Lockheed Martin Corp-made Javelin missiles worth as much
as \$129 million, two of the sources said. The notifications also
included 1,240 TOW anti-tank missiles worth as much as \$299 million,
one of the sources said. There were also 250 stinger missiles worth as
much as \$223 million in the notification, the source said. Stingers are
often used in portable anti-aircraft weapons systems. Taiwan\'s Defense
Ministry confirmed it had requested those weapons and that the request
was proceeding normally. [The U.S. commitment to providing Taiwan with
the weapons to defend itself helps Taiwan\'s military to raise its
combat abilities, **consolidates the Taiwan-U.S. security partnership**
and ensures Taiwan\'s security]{.underline}, the ministry said in a
statement. **[The Chinese government condemned the planned
sale.]{.underline}** \"[We are severely concerned about the U.S. move
**and are firmly against U.S. arms sales to Taiwan**,\" Foreign Ministry
spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing in Beijing. China urges
the United States to stop arms sales to Taiwan and prudently deal with
issues relating **to Taiwan to prevent harm to bilateral relations and
peace and stability** in the Taiwan Strait]{.underline}, he added. CHINA
HAWK U.S. President Donald Trump\'s administration rolled out a
long-awaited overhaul of U.S. arms export policy in 2018 aimed at
expanding sales to allies, saying it would bolster the American defense
industry and create jobs at home. Trump\'s trade adviser Peter Navarro
was one of the administration\'s architects of that policy. Navarro, a
China hawk, wrote about the possible sale of tanks to Taiwan in a March
opinion column in the New York Times ahead of a presidential trip to the
Lima, Ohio, plant where they are made. At a low point, the U.S. Army had
only one tank coming from the plant a month, General Dynamics CEO Phebe
Novakovic said during an April conference call with investors, but said
\"we\'ll be rolling out 30 tanks a month by the end of this year,\"
partly because of international orders. [The Pentagon announced last
week it would sell 34 ScanEagle drones, made by Boeing Co , to the
governments of Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam for \$47
million. The drones would afford greater intelligence-gathering
capabilities, **potentially curbing Chinese activity in the region**.
China claims almost all of the strategic South China Sea and frequently
lambastes the United States and its allies over naval operations near
Chinese-occupied islands. Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Taiwan and Vietnam **all have competing claims.** China\'s Defense
Minister Wei Fenghe warned the United States at the Shangri-La Dialogue
in Singapore last weekend not to meddle in security disputes over Taiwan
and the South China Sea.]{.underline} Acting U.S. Defense Secretary
Patrick Shanahan told the meeting that the United States would no longer
\"tiptoe\" around China\'s behavior in Asia. Taiwan\'s Foreign Ministry,
responding to the Reuters report of planned the new arms sale, said
Wei\'s \"threatening\" comments and recent Chinese military drills near
Taiwan showed the importance of its need to strengthen its defensive
abilities. \"Going forward our government will continue to deepen the
close security partnership between Taiwan and the United States,\" it
said.

[Engagement begins with the assumption that the United States has huge
national interest in Sino-American coopera-tion. Ever since President
Richard Nixon opened up to China in 1972, supporters of engagement,
including policy makers, former presidents and prominent academics, have
held sig-nificant sway over US policy towards the PRC.]{.underline} At
its core, [engagement with China has two goals: to empower eco-nomic
internationalists in China and elicit more cooperation from Beijing, and
to give China a bigger stake in the liberal world order and broaden
domestic support for political reforms]{.underline}. At the same time,
there is always the possibility of using force should engagement fail
and China became a more threatening adversary. [The United States should
main-tain a strong leadership and security alliances in East Asia to
defend against illiberal challengers. As a result, Washington hopes that
constraining and even transformative effects may arise from continued
contacts with Beijing, even in times of tense relations between the two
capitals]{.underline} (Sutter,2010). [Adherents of engagement start from
the premise that Bei-jing's intentions are defensive and US military
power will remain superior to that of the PRC. They assume that Chi-na's
ambitions are unlikely to go beyond current claims to specific
territories not under its control, **primarily
Taiwan**]{.underline}(Gross, 2012). [They see no reason why China would
over-throw the existing international order, one from **which it has
benefited for a considerable amount of time**]{.underline}
(Ikenberry,2011a, 2011b; Steinfeld, 2010). Although they do not rule out
the possibility of China attempting to offset US military power in East

change in the future, US military dominance would be able to meet any
challenge posed by the People's Liberation Army
(PLA]{.underline})(Swaine, 2011). In these observers' eyes, given the
vast power gap between the two countries, [China's rapid rise does not
demand a dramatic shift in US engagement policy anytime soon. Given the
vast power gap between the two countries, China's rapid rise would not
demand a dramatic shift in US engagement policy anytime soon. Engagement
is vulnerable to a range of criticisms, particu-larly in the face of
China's growing assertiveness at home and abroad]{.underline} (Campbell
and Ratner, 2018). [For its defenders, however, more engagement, rather
than less, is needed in response to the intensifying security dilemma
posed by Chi-na's rapid military build-up. China's increasing military
coer-cion **is blamed on Washington's failure to deepen its engagement
with the PLA.** In order to enhance mutual trust and reduce uncertainty,
**Washington should address Beijing's concerns about US arms sales to
Taiwan**, surveillance patrols in Chinese waters, and the US military
posture in the Wes-tern Pacific, in return for China's commitment to a
peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue and the territorial disputes in
the East and South China Seas]{.underline} (Swaine, 2011, 2015). The
goal is to persuade Beijing to avoid the mistakes of Wil-helmine Germany
in the run up to World War I. As a result, in the eyes of its
supporters, [the preferred alternative to the current policy of
engagement is not its replacement, but rather its reinforcement. Some in
the engagement camp propose a two-pronged approach. While engaging
Beijing, Washington should also deepen its engagement with its allies
and other partners in the region]{.underline} (Ratner, 2013). Others
suggest that the United States should require more explicit quid pro quo
on the part of the PRC. David Lampton (2016), for example, advises
Washington to ask Beijing to get tough on Pyongyang, open appropriate
access for American journalists and respect US interests in freedom of
navigation. If this view prevails, an updated US engagement policy will
become more condi-tional and demand more reciprocity in its deepened
interde-pendence with China. Nevertheless, [others have come to believe
that the benefits to the United States of engage-ment with China, no
matter how it is adjusted, are likely to wane. As China grows stronger,
they speculate, **Washington will have no choice but to accommodate
Beijing's interests**]{.underline}

[Given the tensions]{.underline}---and the anger in Beijing---[that are
generated by US arms sales to Taiwan, some in the United States propose
that Washington end]{.underline} (or at least scale back) [weapons sales
to the island. Doing so]{.underline}, proponents suggest, [would remove
a major irritant in the US-China relationship and would increase trust
and cooperation in bilateral relations.]{.underline}6 More
fundamentally, proponents of a reduced US commitment to Taiwan suggest
that [such a policy approach would help lower the risk of armed conflict
in East Asia]{.underline}. This argument is developed most fully by
Charles Glaser,7 who suggests that [ending the US commitment to defend
Taiwan would bring with it two significant benefits for the US-China
relationship]{.underline}. [First, it could improve US-China relations
because such a shift]{.underline} in US policy [would remove a key
source of mistrust in Beijing concerning US motivations. Second, ending
US support for Taiwan]{.underline}---[by removing the key potential
source of military conflict between China and the United States---would
reduce military competition between Washington and Beijing.]{.underline}
Glaser thus proposes a "grand bargain," in which the United States would
end its commitment to Taiwan in return for Chinese willingness to
"resolve its maritime disputes on 'fair' terms" and to accept a
long-term US security presence in East Asia. Others argue that the US
commitment to Taiwan is increasingly untenable as China's military power
continues to grow. For instance, Chas Freeman warns that a continued US
commitment to Taiwan is incompatible with (a) waning US relative power
in the region and (b) the importance that the PRC places on the issue. A
failure to accommodate US policy to new geopolitical realities, in turn,
risks future military conflict over an issue about which China cares
deeply.8 John Mearsheimer argues along similar lines that China's rise
as a great power, if it continues, will mean that the current US
security commitment to Taiwan will be increasingly unsustainable. Taiwan
will ultimately be forced to accommodate growing Chinese power.9
Proposals to scale back US security ties to Taiwan are controversial,
however, and several scholars have written thoughtful critiques of the
idea. These critiques have generally made a few key points. First, it is
not self-evident that ending security ties with Taiwan would in fact
transform the US-China relationship: the interests of the two countries
arguably clash on many other issues (North Korea, maritime disputes in
East Asia, economic issues), and it is unclear why Beijing would yield
on these other issues if only the United States were to adopt a policy
on arms sales that---from Beijing's vantage---the United States had
already committed to follow in the 1982 joint communiqué. Second, the
United States' reputation in the region could be at stake. Some worry
that walking away from a commitment to Taiwan would send a troubling
signal to other US allies in East Asia. Beijing might likewise view US
concessions on Taiwan as a sign of weakness and conclude that Washington
was unlikely to challenge the PRC on other issues in the region. Third,
ending arms sales---because it would add to Taiwan's sense of
insecurity---could actually make Taipei more hesitant about entering
into sensitive political talks with the PRC; thus it isn't clear that a
reduced US commitment to Taiwan would facilitate a peaceful resolution
to the dispute. Finally, and relatedly, ending arms sales would likely
undercut Taiwan's deterrent capabilities, which in turn could encourage
a more coercive PRC approach to the island.10 [While we find these
counterarguments plausible, we believe the logic underpinning them needs
to be teased out at greater length. This is especially so for claims
about the prospects for stability in the Taiwan Strait]{.underline}. For
instance, we believe it is likely that [an end to arms sales would
indeed lead Taiwanese officials to feel less confident about their
bargaining power vis-à-vis the PRC. But it is not obvious why this
should in itself make them less likely to negotiate with Beijing: it is
also plausible that]{.underline}, in such a scenario, [Taiwan's leaders
would feel they had no other choice but to negotiate with an
increasingly powerful PRC. Similarly, while a shift in the cross-Strait
balance of power would indeed imply that Beijing could more easily
utilize a military option, it isn't obvious that this would in turn make
the relationship less stable: it is conceivable]{.underline}, for
instance, [that Taiwan would respond with more accommodating policies
that would remove Beijing's incentives to consider military
force.]{.underline} In short, how a shifting cross-Strait military
balance of power would affect stability in the Taiwan Strait is not
straightforward; in the following section, we consider the topic more
systematically

#### Ending arms sales to Taiwan solves -- Beijing's views U.S. commitment as a strategy to keep China as a secondary superpower

More important, however, is that focusing on the quality of current
cross strait relations overlooks two other less direct, but potentially
more significant, benefits of U.S. accommodation on Taiwan. First, U.S.
support for Taiwan is one of the most important, possibly the most
important, policy-driven sources of China's suspicions about U.S.
motives and intentions. Although the United International Security
States does not take a position on what the final outcome of the Taiwan
issue should be, [China considers U.S. support of Taiwan a key source of
"strategic distrust." A recent study by two leading authorities on
U.S.-China relations concludes that Beijing views U.S. arms sales to
Taiwan "as confirming American arrogance and determination to interfere
in China's domestic affairs and to prevent peaceful unification from
occurring, thereby harming a clearly-articulated Chinese core
interest]{.underline}." In a similar vein, their report argues that
["continuing to provide Taiwan with advanced weapons . . . is viewed as
pernicious in Chinese eyes and has added to suspicion that Washington
will disregard Chinese interests and sentiments as long as China's power
position is secondary to America's.]{.underline}"68 Nathan and Scobell
conclude that "most Chinese see strategic motives at the root of
American behavior. [They believe that keeping the Taiwan problem going
helps the U.S. tie China down]{.underline}."69 Similarly, a prominent
Chinese analyst argues: "[The position the U.S. takes on the Taiwan
issue determines the essence of American strategy toward China, and thus
determines the quality and status of U.S.-China
relations]{.underline}."70 Xu Hui, a professor at China's National
Defense University, holds that "U.S. policies toward Taiwan have been
and are the fundamental cause of some anti-American sentiment among the
Chinese public\....[I assure you that a posture change of the U.S.
policy on Taiwan will **remove the major obstacle for our military-to
military relations** and also **strengthen Sino-American cooperation by
winning the hearts and minds of 1.3 billion Chinese
people**]{.underline}."71 **[In short, ending the U.S. commitment to
Taiwan has the potential to dramatically improve U.S.-China relations,
which in turn could increase the possibility of cooperation on other
issues and reduce the probability of competition and
conflict]{.underline}**.

### AT Trade Wars More Important 

#### Arms sales to Taiwan outweigh current trade war on US China relations

**Kawase** 20**18**

(Kenji, Nikkei Asian Review chief business news correspondent, "[Taiwan
issue a **bigger concern** than US-China trade war]{.underline}",

TOKYO \-- [A prominent Asia scholar does not consider the U.S.-China
trade war the **most worrisome** development in the region.
Rather]{.underline}, what concerns Ezra Vogel, professor emeritus at
Harvard University, is [a **dangerous shift away** from the delicate
bilateral framework on Taiwan forged almost four decades
ago.]{.underline} \"[I am **not as worried as others about the trade
war**]{.underline},\" said Vogel, speaking to the Nikkei Asian Review in
fluent Japanese during his recent visit to Tokyo. To him, President
Donald Trump is only \"bargaining\" for better business deals, and not
only with China. Other targets include Mexico and Canada as evidenced by
the revamped North American Free Trade Agreement. [Vogel expects trade
tensions with China to rise, but does not anticipate the situation
\"spiraling out of contro]{.underline}l,\" as he believes cooler heads
on both sides will prevail to protect the substantial human and economic
ties that bind the two countries. [His **bigger concern** is the Trump
administration\'s Taiwan policy. The]{.underline} Taiwan Travel Act that
took effect in March allows mutual visits between U.S. and Taiwanese
officials. [He also finds **alarming Washington\'s approval of a [\$330
million arms sale to
Taiwan](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-Relations/U.S.-approval-of-330m-military-sale-to-Taiwan-draws-China-s-ire)**
in September following a \$1.4 billion deal made last year**.
Restricting** official relationships and arms deals with Taiwan were key
to the U.S. and China establishing diplomatic links in
1979]{.underline}. Hence, the [recent moves by the Trump administration
are \"**dangerous\" and \"going too far**.\" Vogel believes \"the U.S.
is not abiding by its previous promises made on Taiwan.\" The U.S.
agreed to switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to
Beijing]{.underline} and confine exchanges with the island to
\"cultural, commercial and other unofficial relations.\" At the same
time, [it only \"acknowledged\" Beijing\'s claim that Taiwan was part of
China]{.underline}. In the 1982 communique that dealt specifically with
arms deals, [the U.S. stated its intention to gradually reduce sales
\"to a final resolution,\" but did not commit to any time
frame]{.underline}. Before signing the agreement, [however, Washington
provided Taiwan with six assurances, one of which was not setting a
termination date for arms sales. This is the **strategic ambiguity**
that guides Washington\'s hand, one which Beijing plays as
well.]{.underline} Vogel has authored a biography on Deng Xiaoping and
deeply understands the process and the spirit behind past agreements.
\"[If the U.S. continues doing something peculiar \[like its current
actions\], **China may respond in a peculiar way as
well**,\"]{.underline} he warned. [Despite his concern, America and
Taiwan are set to **further cement military cooperation** at the
U.S.-Taiwan Defense Industry Conference starting on Sunday.]{.underline}

## 

## China Peaceful Rise

### Plan 🡪 Peaceful Rise

#### Chinese policy is teetering in the balance of a hostile or cooperative rise -- conciliatory action by the US will determine the nature of their rise to power

**Shifrinson 19**

(Joshua Shifrinson, Assistant Professor of International Relations with
the Pardee School of Global Affairs at Boston University, "Should the
United States Fear China's Rise?", 1/24/19, accessed 6/27/19,
https://doi.org/10.1080/0163660X.2018.1557491)//AM

In short, [despite concerns a rising China is apt to be a highly
predatory, revisionist state]{.underline} likely to challenge the United
States for dominance in East Asia and beyond, there are good reasons to
believe [this concern is overstated]{.underline}. If current trends
hold, [China may have reasons to try to prey upon the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, but the real risk of
antagonizing the United States during a period when the United States
will retain **[significant capabilities to make China pay]{.underline}**
dearly for aggrandizement **[means Chinese predation should remain
limited]{.underline}** in scope. Moreover, [if and when still other
great powers rise]{.underline}---a possibility that cannot be excluded
out of hand---[China may then face reasons to support the United States
and seek U.S. backing against other challengers]{.underline}. In either
case, the United States is playing a strong hand. More precisely, the
different scenarios point to distinct options for the United States as
U.S. policymakers grapple with the strategic changes needed to adjust to
China's rise. In the first scenario---China as cautious predator---[U.S.
policymakers face an obvious incentive to try to deter additional
Chinese predation by acquiring military capabilities to contain Chinese
aggrandizement]{.underline}. Prima facie, this might seem to call for an
assertive U.S. strategy to actively contain China. In reality, however,
retaining the ability to impose military costs on China need not mean an
expansive and open-ended arms buildup or coalition-building exercise.
Instead, [retaining the ability to impose costs on China could just as
well mean retaining the ability to "surge" forces into Asia]{.underline}
in the event of a crisis, moving offshore and imposing costs on the PRC
from afar (e.g., by [a blockade]{.underline}), [or]{.underline} even
[positioning tripwire forces around a security perimeter while preparing
to mobilize]{.underline} should China cross that hypothetical line. In
fact, the seemingly [greater lethality of modern military
tech]{.underline}nologies [compared to previous periods]{.underline} may
[allow the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to retain potent
military forces to dissuade Chinese aggrandizement with]{.underline}
reasonably [limited investment of blood and treasure]{.underline}.
Meanwhile, such costimposing military options carry a further benefit in
that they may help the United States husband its resources for what may
be a long-term effort. Although U.S. policymakers understandably wish to
pursue an assertive, forward-leaning strategy that would maximize U.S.
control over events while hemming in China, U.S. ends may be attainable
through other means. More limited forms of engagement may satisfy
American goals. Conversely, the second scenario---China as
self-interested supporter of the United States---would argue strongly
for something akin to restraint or offshore balancing. In this
circumstance, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [could
maximize the likelihood and scope of Chinese cooperation by taking steps
that]{.underline} (1) [signal the United States might well work with the
PRC against China's other competitors]{.underline} and (2) that the
United States is itself not a military threat. Hence, U.S. strategies
that reduce the U.S. role and presence in East Asia would seem to have
much to commend them. [Retracting U.S. security commitments and reducing
any lingering U.S. military challenge to China would increase the
likelihood that Chinese leaders]{.underline} would [conclude the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is]{.underline} relatively
[less threatening to China than other great powers]{.underline}. Fearing
the United States might be enticed by another actor, China may then bid
for U.S. cooperation. In short, [the U.S]{.underline}. mission in this
second scenario is [choosing a path that reinforces the incentives a
rising China would have to support the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates---[offshore balancing and/or restraint may
accomplish this]{.underline}. Ultimately, China's rise is among the most
important geopolitical developments in modern world politics. While the
shift in the distribution of power portends significant global changes,
the implications for the United States loom just as large. For the first
time in a quarter century, the United States is operating in an
environment where another great power's concerns matter---American
relative power is waning. Facing an adverse power shift, U.S.
policymakers and analysts alike are voicing understandable concerns that
a rising China will prove an inherent and increasingly assertive
challenger as its relative strength grows. Viewed in theoretical and
historical context, however, there are actually good reasons for
cautious optimism [that a rising China will not prove an all-out
predator eager to push the United States from the great power
ranks]{.underline}. In the final analysis, not only should the United
States retain the military capacity to keep Chinese aggrandizement in
check for the foreseeable future, but there may well be future shifts in
the distribution of power that the United States can exploit to
encourage Chinese support and cooperation. Although [U.S. policymakers
must be prepared to adjust the United States' own strategy to reinforce
and exploit these developments, cool calculation rather than undue worry
is the solution]{.underline}. China's rise is problematic, but history
and theory both indicate the United States is in a manageable---and
potentially advantageous---position.

### Plan 🡪 Peaceful Rise

#### Strategies of Asian predominance are grounded in [zero-sum mentality]{.underline} of the China threat\-\--this produces security dilemmas. The aff ends Chinese motivations for confrontation.

**Swaine 15** (Michael, Senior Associate in the Asia Program at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, "The Real Challenge in the
Pacific", Foreign Affairs. May/Jun2015, Vol. 94 Issue 3)

[For analysts such as krepinevich, [it is axiomatic that rising powers
such as China seek]{.mark} hard power [dominance]{.mark} and that the
central challenge for currently dominant powers such as the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is how to prevent them from
doing so. [This]{.mark} sort of [zero-sum
thinking]{.mark}]{.underline}--- which is increasingly common on both
sides of the Pacific---[[polarizes the region and undermines the]{.mark}
goals of continued [peace]{.mark} and prosperity [toward which all
strive. Both sides would benefit from]{.mark} a different
approach]{.underline}, one [that moved from a growing contest over U.S.
predominance in the region to a]{.underline} genuine, long-term
[[balance of power]{.mark} in the western Pacific resting on mutual
military and political restraint and accommodation]{.underline}, as well
as new policy initiatives designed [[to reduce]{.mark} the volatility of
[flash points]{.mark}]{.underline} such as the korean Peninsula and
Taiwan. CLASHING ASSUMPTIONS [Virtually all U.S. officials]{.underline}
and many Asian leaders [believe]{.underline} that [American military
predominance]{.underline} in the maritime realm [has provided the
foundation for]{.underline} a 70-year period of relative [peace and
prosperity throughout]{.underline} most of [the Asia-Pacific
region]{.underline}, forestalling arms races and militarized disputes
and permitting a sustained focus on peaceful economic development. [Many
Chinese, however, believe that in an increasingly multipolar and
interdependent world, order and prosperity should rely on a roughly
equal balance of power]{.underline}, both globally and
[among]{.underline} the region's [major nations, which should cooperate
in managing common challenges]{.underline}, working whenever possible
through international institutions such as the United Nations. To some
extent, these views are self-serving. Washington benefits enormously
from a U.S.-led international order in which its views and preferences
are given special consideration, and Beijing would benefit from a more
equal balance of power, which would give it a greater voice and check
the United States. But elites in each country also genuinely think that
their position accurately reflects the current and future reality of the
international system. Americans generally believe that peace and
stability flourish under American hegemony, which can and should be
preserved, and their Chinese counterparts generally believe that such
hegemony is an unfortunate historical anomaly that should give way to a
more balanced distribution of power---and that it is doing so already.
For most of the postwar era, [these perspectives coexisted]{.underline}
relatively easily, primarily [because Beijing was too weak to push its
own view]{.underline} and was able to rise steadily within the
U.S.-sponsored order. But [times have changed; China has outgrown its
subordinate status and now feels strong enough to press its
case]{.underline} in the western Pacific. [This]{.underline} development
[should not be surprising to anyone who understands modern Chinese
history and great-power transitions. [Beijing]{.mark} has an ongoing
incentive to work with Washington]{.underline} and the West [to
sustain]{.underline} continued economic [growth and]{.underline} to
[address]{.underline} a growing array of [common global and regional
concerns]{.underline}, from pandemics to climate change to terrorism.
[At the same time, it understandably [wishes to reduce its vulnerability
to]{.mark} potential future [threats from the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates and other
nations while increasing its overall influence along its strategically
important maritime periphery. As its overseas power and influence grow,
its foreign interests expand, and its domestic nationalist backers
become more assertive, [Beijing will naturally become less willing to
accept unconditionally military]{.underline}, political, and economic
relationships and [structures that it believes]{.underline}
disproportionately and [unjustly favor Western powers. And it will
increasingly worry that Washington might resort to]{.underline} pressure
or [force]{.underline} to try to undermine Chinese security moves in the
western Pacific and head off the United States' impending relative
decline. Many [Chinese observers]{.underline} now [believe]{.underline}
that Beijing's [past weakness]{.underline} and its need to cooperate
with the United States and the West in general have [made it too
accommodating]{.underline} or passive in dealing with perceived
challenges to China's vital national interests, from U.S. support for
Taiwan and Asian disputants over maritime claims to close-up U.S.
surveillance and other intelligence-gathering activities along the
Chinese coast. The more extreme variants of this nationalist viewpoint
threaten to transform China's long-standing "peaceful development"
policy, which focuses on the maintenance of amicable relations with the
United States and other powers, into a more hard-edged approach aimed at
more actively undermining U.S. influence in Asia. The so-called
bottom-line concept of Chinese President Xi Jinping's foreign policy is
an apparent step in this direction, stressing in an unprecedented manner
the need for China to stand resolute in managing territorial and
sovereignty issues in the East China and South China Seas. [Observing
these stirrings]{.underline}, meanwhile, many [American]{.underline} and
other foreign [observers see the beginnings of a larger effort to eject
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [from Asia]{.underline} and
eventually replace it as the regional, and possibly even global,
superpower. [[China's greater assertiveness]{.underline}]{.mark}
regarding maritime territorial disputes and U.S. and Japanese
intelligence and surveillance activities along its coastline [[are
interpreted as tests of]{.mark} U.S.]{.underline} and allied
[[resolve]{.underline}]{.mark}, a prelude to the creation of no-go zones
essential for the establishment of Chinese control over the western
Pacific. [In this view, the proper course of action for Washington is to
decisively disabuse Beijing of its aspirations by enhancing U.S.
predominance, increasing Chinese vulnerability]{.underline} in the
western Pacific, and making clear who is boss, right up to China's
12-nautical-mile territorial waters. [The problem with [this
outlook]{.mark}--- implicit in the concept]{.underline} of Archipelagic
Defense that [krepinevich proposes---is that it [**misdiagnoses China's
motivations** and]{.mark} thus **[exacerbates]{.mark}, rather than
mitigates, [the]{.mark} underlying [problem]{.mark}**[.
Beijing's]{.mark} de facto [attempts to limit]{.mark}]{.underline} or
end [[U.S. predominance]{.mark} along its maritime periphery [are
motivated by **uncertainty, insecurity**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
opportunism [**[rather than a grand strategic vision]{.mark}** of
Chinese predominance. [Chinese leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} today [[are
not trying to carve out an exclusionary sphere of
influence]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially in hard-power terms; [[they
are trying to reduce their considerable vulnerability]{.mark} and
increase their]{.underline} political, diplomatic, and economic
[leverage in their own backyard. This is a much less ambitious and in
many ways more understandable goal for a continental great power. It
does not necessarily threaten vital U.S. or allied interests, and
[it]{.mark}]{.underline} can [and [should be met with understanding
rather than defensive aggressiveness]{.mark}]{.underline}. UNSUSTAINABLE
TRENDS [Continued [U.S. predominance in the western Pacific cannot be
justified by the need to resist a Chinese drive to replace it, nor is it
necessary]{.mark} in order [to ensure regional (and global) order. It is
inconceivable that Beijing will accept U.S. predominance in
perpetuity]{.mark}]{.underline} and that it will grant the United States
complete freedom of action in the Pacific and recognize its ability to
prevail militarily in a potential conflict. [[Trying to sustain]{.mark}
such [predominance]{.mark}, therefore, [is]{.mark} actually **[the
quickest route to instability]{.mark}, practically [guaranteeing an arms
race, increased regional polarization, and reduced cooperation]{.mark}**
between Washington and Beijing on common global challenges]{.underline}.
And even if some Chinese leaders were tempted to accept continued U.S.
predominance, they would almost certainly end up meeting fierce and
sustained domestic criticism for doing so as China's power grows and
would likely end up reversing course to ensure their political survival.
[Trying to sustain American military predominance in the
region]{.underline}, meanwhile, [will become increasingly difficult and
expensive. A recent study by the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace]{.underline} (which I co-authored) on the long-term security
environment in Asia concluded that the United States will remain the
strongest military power on a global level for many years to come. But
this study also [found]{.underline} that [Washington will almost
certainly confront increasingly severe economically induced limitations
on its defense spending that will constrain its efforts to keep well
ahead of a growing Chinese military]{.underline} and paramilitary
presence with[in]{.underline} approximately 1,500 nautical miles of the
Chinese coastline (that is, the area covered by [the]{.underline}
so-called [first island chain]{.underline}). The barriers to maritime
predominance, however, apply to China as well as the United States. The
Carnegie Endowment study also concluded that U.S. military power in Asia
will almost certainly remain very strong and that even increased Chinese
regional military capabilities will not offer Beijing unambiguous
superiority. Any Chinese attempt to establish predominance in Asia would
fail, therefore, both because it would be difficult for China to surpass
the United States and because a scenario of this kind would frighten
bystanders and drive them into Washington's arms. **[[Chinese
leaders]{.mark} understand this and so [are highly unlikely to seek
predominance if they feel that they can achieve]{.mark} a decent amount
of [security in less confrontational ways. They are likely to
seek]{.mark}]{.underline}** some form of
**[[predominance]{.underline}]{.mark}** (as opposed to acting merely
opportunistically and in a more limited manner) **[[only if
Washington's]{.mark} words and [actions convince them that even the
minimal level of security they seek requires it]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Unfortunately, [the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates' [adoption of aggressive [military
concepts]{.mark}]{.underline}--- such as Air-Sea Battle, Offshore
Control, or even Archipelagic Defense---would deny them such security
and thus [[contribute to an ever-worsening security
dilemma]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Plan Key to Peaceful Rise

#### Transition is inevitable, but we can make it peaceful. The aff is not appeasement but is an integration with China that avoids great power war

[**The primary goal of US foreign policy must be the creation of a
satisfied China**. In no way does this mean appeasement or concessionary
policies]{.underline}. Creating a satisfied China relates to the
conditions that lead to the emergence of internal policies and
preferences in China for accepting the international status quo. Some of
this can be managed from abroad. Some cannot. China's entry into the WTO
was a good first step. Economic interactions create the opportunities to
socialize China into the prevailing rules and norms of commerce.
Security arrangements could follow. Here [the status of Taiwan is
critical]{.underline}. Potentially, [the most explosive issue in
Asia]{.underline} is the debate over the reunification of China and
Taiwan. [The management of this confrontation will shape the long-term
relationship between the United States and China]{.underline}. [How both
nations handle this controversy will influence]{.underline}, if not
determine, [their permanent long-term relationship]{.underline}. The
dynamics of the US-China relationship are defined by their changing
relative power. This dynamic is illustrated in Figure 8. Note that
[China's power is growing relative to that of the US. China will
overtake the United States in the next thirty to fifty years, long
before it is an advanced developed nation]{.underline}. The potential
confrontation will be---as in the case of Germany and the USSR in World
War II---one between a very advanced nation and a developing giant.
Whether one assumes slow or rapid growth is less important than the
essential trend. **[These overall trends can lead to a peaceful or
contested transition depending on the actions by the two
giants]{.underline}**. A major point of contention between them remains
the political dispute over Taiwan. China surely recognizes that time is
on its side, and may even see the benefits of an autonomous Taiwan.
Patience on the part of the Chinese leadership could bring the reward of
reunification without the use of force. The longer that China postpones
the use of force, the greater is the relative power shift from the US to
China and the higher the likelihood that an accommodation that maximizes
autonomy for Taiwan can be reached. Indeed as Figure 8 indicates, there
is greater room for accommodation under a cooperative US leadership. The
fundamental question is how long can this expectation be sustained
without generating the preconditions for a global war? Figure 9 shows
the three-way interaction between the US, China and Taiwan. Had Taiwan
declared its independence very early in the overtaking process, perhaps
immediately following the recognition of China by the United States,
Taiwan may well have succeeded without generating a regional or a global
conflict. This is no longer the case. Today, using its economic and
military preponderance, the United States can force China to back down
in any crisis. The overwhelming majority of studies indicate that the US
today certainly would win any military encounter in the Pacific because
the US navy can protect Taiwan against an invasion. Our estimates
suggest that in the Asian hierarchy US preponderance should last for 25
years and then the tables will start to turn. [This is not a long time
to alter international structures and perceptions]{.underline}. [It is
in the interest of both China and the US to find ways to postpone the
day of reckoning over Taiwan]{.underline}. An early regional conflict
prior to the anticipated transition would result in a likely defeat for
China, but the resentment would then set up a later confrontation that
carries with it the extraordinarily high costs of a global conflict. [In
the nuclear era a global conflict of this magnitude would be
devastating]{.underline}. [From the Power Transition perspective the
goal of a stable US policy is the addition of China into economic and
security arrangements]{.underline}. The first step in the direction of
cooperative relations was achieved when US support assured China's
membership in the WTO. However, a NATO-like security membership is
lacking

### China Rise Good w/out U.S. Involvement 

#### Chinese hegemony is peaceful without U.S. involvement in Taiwan -- Beijing will perceive arms sales as a security threat and attack on Chinese nationalism -- escalates to U.S.-China war

[China's rise will continue to redefine international politics in East
Asia. Contrary to many pessimistic assessments, China can rise
peacefully. Its growing military and economic power pose major
challenges to U.S. dominance in the region, but need not lead to
conflict]{.underline}. However[, China's peaceful rise is far from
assured. Both ambition and insecurity could lead China to challenge the
status quo, generating an armed class with the United
States]{.underline}. [U.S. strategy must therefore strike a careful
balance: its policies must effectively deter attacks against U.S. vital
interests, while at the same time not posing a serious threat to China's
security]{.underline}. Careful maintenance of the long-standing United
States policy toward Taiwan is the best path forward. Even [appearing to
be moving toward supporting Taiwan's independence would be seen by
China's leaders as a highly provocative act. China considers Taiwan to
be part of its homeland and unification remains a key political goal for
Beijing. The growing centrality of nationalism to the legitimacy of the
Chinese Communist Party makes Taiwan's future essential to the regime's
survival. China has made clear that it will use force if Taiwan declares
independence.]{.underline} Consequently, president-elect Trump's
telephone call with the leader of Taiwan and his seemingly cavalier
attitude toward upending the United States' long-standing Taiwan policy
are deeply misguided. [**Shifts** in U.S. policy that **encourage**
Taiwan to believe that the United States will support its moves toward
independence **increase the probability of war**. For example, the
United States could change Taiwan's expectations by revising the
conditions under which it will come to Taiwan's aid.]{.underline} The
United States currently tries to constrain Taiwan by making its defense
commitment conditional --- the United States will respond only to
unprovoked Chinese attacks; that is, it will not come to Taiwan's
defense if a Chinese attack is provoked by Taiwan's declaration of
independence. Eliminating or blurring this conditionality could embolden
Taiwan. A variety of dangers could follow. [If Taiwan declares
independence, war between China and Taiwan is the likely outcome. Even
moving too far in that direction could fuel a major crisis. And if the
United States actually would come to Taiwan's defense, then conventional
war between China and the United States also becomes more likely.
Conventional war between two nuclear powers increases the probability of
nuclear war]{.underline}. Other paths to conflict could also result. [In
response to a newly provocative policy toward Taiwan, China might adopt
still more assertive policies in the South China and East China Seas.
The United States could then get drawn into conflict to protect a friend
or ally]{.underline}. [China might accelerate its buildup of
conventional forces to further improve its ability to coerce
Taiwan]{.underline}, which would intensify military competition with the
United States and strain political relations. If any change is in order,
the United States should be moving in the opposite direction ---
[reducing its commitment to Taiwan to improve U.S. relations with China.

that the United States should pursue a grand bargain with China: China
would resolve its maritime disputes and officially accept the United
States' military presence and alliance commitments in East Asia; in
turn, the United States would end its commitment to Taiwan]{.underline}.
Although costly, among other reasons because Taiwan is a democracy,
accommodation could increase U.S. security. But China's growing
assertiveness, especially in the South China Sea, has cast doubt on the
wisdom of such a bargain --- accommodating an expansionist state can be
self-defeating. Down the road, the prospects for bargained mutual
accommodation may be better. For the time being[, careful maintenance of
the long-standing United States policy toward Taiwan is the best path
forward.]{.underline}

What? You didn't hear about this anywhere? And even now, you're not
exactly blown away, right? Well, such a name change may not sound like
much, but someday you may look back and realize that it couldn't have
been more consequential or ominous. Think of it as a signal that [the US
military is already setting the stage for]{.underline} an eventual
[confrontation with China.]{.underline} If, until now, you hadn't read
about Mattis's decision anywhere, I'm not surprised since the media gave
it virtually no attention---less certainly than would have been accorded
the least significant tweet Donald Trump ever dispatched. What coverage
it did receive treated the name change as no more than a passing
"symbolic" gesture, a Pentagon ploy to encourage India to join Japan,
Australia, and other US allies in America's Pacific alliance system. "In
Symbolic Nod to India, US Pacific Command Changes Name" was the
[headline](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-defense-india/in-symbolic-nod-to-india-us-pacific-command-changes-name-idUSKCN1IV2Q2)
of a Reuters story on the subject and, to the extent that any attention
was paid, it was typical. That the media's military analysts failed to
notice anything more than symbolism in the deep-sixing of PACOM
shouldn't be surprising, given all the attention being paid to other
major international developments---the pyrotechnics of the Korean summit
in Singapore, the insults traded at and after the G7 meeting in Canada,
or the ominous gathering storm over Iran. Add to this the poor grasp so
many journalists have of the nature of the US military's strategic
thinking. Still, [Mattis]{.underline} himself [has not been shy about
the geopolitical significance of linking the Indian and Pacific Oceans
in such planning]{.underline}. In fact, [it represents a fundamental
shift in US military thinking with potentially far-reaching
consequences]{.underline}. Consider the backdrop to the name change: in
recent months, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has
stepped up its naval patrols in waters adjacent to Chinese-occupied
islands in the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea
([as has China]{.underline}), **[raising the prospect of future
clashes]{.underline}** between the warships of the two countries. [Such
moves have been accompanied by ever more threatening language from
the]{.underline} Department of Defense ([DoD]{.underline}), [indicating
an intent to do nothing less than engage China militarily if that
country's build-up in the region continues]{.underline}. "When it comes
down to introducing what they have done in the South China Sea, there
are consequences," Mattis
[declared](https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript-View/Article/1538599/remarks-by-secretary-mattis-at-plenary-session-of-the-2018-shangri-la-dialogue/)
at the Shangri La Strategic Dialogue in Singapore on June 2. As a
preliminary indication of what he meant by this, Mattis promptly
[disinvited](https://news.usni.org/2018/05/23/china-disinvited-participating-2018-rimpac-exercise)
the Chinese from the world's largest multinational naval exercise, the
Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC), conducted annually under American auspices.
"But that's a relatively small consequence," he added ominously, "and I
believe there are much larger consequences in the future." With that in
mind, he soon
[announced](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/30/asia/mattis-south-china-sea-intl/index.html)
that the Pentagon is planning to conduct "a steady drumbeat" of naval
operations in waters abutting those Chinese-occupied islands, which
should raise the heat between the two countries and could create the
conditions for a miscalculation, a mistake, or even an accident at sea
that might lead to far worse. In addition to its plans to heighten naval
tensions in seas adjacent to China, [the Pentagon has been laboring to
strengthen its military ties with US-friendly states on China's
perimeter, all clearly part of a long-term drive to]{.underline}---in
Cold War fashion---"[contain" Chinese power in Asia]{.underline}. On
June 8, for example, the DoD
[launched](http://www.pacom.mil/Media/News/News-Article-View/Article/1545620/us-indian-and-japanese-maritime-forces-begin-malabar-exercise/)
Malabar 2018, a joint Pacific Ocean naval exercise involving forces from
India, Japan, and the United States. Incorporating once neutral India
into America's anti-Chinese "Pacific" alliance system in this and other
ways has, in fact, become a major 21st-century goal of the Pentagon,
posing a significant new threat to China. For decades, the principal
objective of US strategy in Asia had been to bolster key Pacific allies
Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the Philippines, while containing
Chinese power in adjacent waters, including the East and South China
Seas. However, in recent times, **[China has sought to spread its
influence into Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean
region]{.underline}**, in part **[by]{.underline}** extolling
**[its]{.underline}** staggeringly ambitious "[**[One Belt, One
Road]{.underline}**](https://www.brookings.edu/research/chinas-rise-as-a-regional-and-global-power-the-aiib-and-the-one-belt-one-road/)"
trade and infrastructure initiative for the Eurasian continent and
Africa. That vast project is clearly meant both as a unique vehicle for
cooperation and a way to tie much of Eurasia into a future
China-centered economic and energy system. **[Threatened by visions of
such a future, American strategists have moved ever more decisively to
constrain Chinese outreach in those very areas]{.underline}**.
**[That]{.underline}**, then, **[is the context for the sudden concerted
drive by US military strategists to link the Indian and Pacific Oceans
and so encircle China with pro-American, anti-Chinese alliance
systems]{.underline}**. The name change on May 30 is a formal
acknowledgement of an encirclement strategy that couldn't, in the long
run, be more dangerous. GIRDING FOR WAR WITH CHINA To grasp the
ramifications of such moves, some background on the former PACOM might
be useful. Originally known as the Far East Command, PACOM was
[established](http://www.pacom.mil/About-USINDOPACOM/History/) in 1947
and has been headquartered at US bases near Honolulu, Hawaii, ever
since. As now constituted, its "[area of
responsibility](http://www.pacom.mil/About-USINDOPACOM/USPACOM-Area-of-Responsibility/)"
encompasses a mind-boggling expanse: all of East, South, and Southeast
Asia, as well as Australia, New Zealand, and the waters of the Indian
and Pacific Oceans---in other words, an area covering about 50% of the
Earth's surface and incorporating more than half of the global
population. Though the Pentagon divides the whole planet like a giant
pie into a set of "unified commands," none of them is larger than the
newly expansive, newly named Indo-Pacific Command, with its 375,000
military and civilian personnel. Before the Indian Ocean was explicitly
incorporated into its fold, PACOM mainly focused on maintaining control
of the western Pacific, especially in waters around a number of friendly
island and peninsula states like Japan, South Korea, and the
Philippines. Its force structure has largely been composed of air and
naval squadrons, along with a large Marine Corps presence on the
Japanese island of Okinawa. Its most powerful combat unit is the [US
Pacific Fleet](http://www.cpf.navy.mil/about/#aor) ---like the area it
now covers, the largest in the world. It's made up of the 3rd and 7th
Fleets, which together have approximately 200 ships and submarines,
nearly 1,200 aircraft, and more than 130,000 sailors, pilots, Marines,
and civilians. On a day-to-day basis, until recently, the biggest worry
confronting the command was the possibility of a conflict with
nuclear-armed North Korea. During the late fall of 2017 and the winter
of 2018, PACOM engaged in a continuing series of exercises designed to
test its forces' ability to overcome North Korean defenses and destroy
its major military assets, including nuclear and missile facilities.
These were undoubtedly intended, above all, as a
[warning](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/11/25/asia-pacific/u-s-south-korea-will-stage-massive-air-exercise-warning-north-korea/)
to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un about what he could expect if he
continued down the path of endless provocative missile and nuclear
tests. It seems that, at least for the time being, President Trump has
[suspended](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/12/us-to-suspend-war-games-with-south-korea-donald-trump-kim-jong-un-north-summit)
such drills as a result of his summit meeting with Kim. North Korea
aside, the principal preoccupation of PACOM commanders has long been the
rising power of China and how to contain it. This was evident at the May
30 ceremony in Hawaii at which Mattis announced that expansive name
change and presided over a
[change-of-command](http://www.pacom.mil/Media/News/News-Article-View/Article/1535776/us-indo-pacific-command-holds-change-of-command-ceremony/)ceremony,
in which outgoing commander, Adm. Harry Harris Jr., was replaced by Adm.
Phil Davidson. (Given the naval-centric nature of its mission, the
command is almost invariably headed by an admiral.) While avoiding any
direct mention of China in his opening remarks, Mattis left not a
smidgeon of uncertainty that the command's new name was a challenge and
a call for the future mobilization of regional opposition across a vast
stretch of the planet to China's dreams and desires. Other nations
welcome US support, he
[insisted](https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript-View/Article/1535689/remarks-at-us-indo-pacific-command-change-of-command-ceremony/),
as they prefer an environment of "free, fair, and reciprocal trade not
bound by any nation's predatory economics or threat of coercion, for the
Indo-Pacific has many belts and many roads." No one could mistake the
meaning of that. Departing Admiral Harris was blunter still. Although
"North Korea remains our most immediate threat," he
[declared](http://www.pacom.mil/Media/Speeches-Testimony/Article/1537219/us-indo-pacific-command-change-of-command-ceremony/),
"[China remains our biggest long-term challenge]{.underline}." He then
offered a warning: Without the stepped-up efforts of the US and its
allies to constrain Beijing, "[China will realize its dream of hegemony
in Asia]{.underline}." Yes, he admitted, it was still possible to
cooperate with the Chinese on limited issues, but [we should "stand
ready to confront them when we must]{.underline}." (On May 18, Admiral
Harris was
[nominated](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-southkorea-harris/trump-nominates-pacific-commander-harris-as-u-s-ambassador-to-seoul-idUSKCN1IJ2RB)
by President Trump as the future US ambassador to South Korea, which
will place a former military man at the US Embassy in Seoul.) Harris's
successor, Admiral Davidson, seems, if anything, even more determined to
put confronting China atop the command's agenda. During his confirmation
hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on April 17, he
repeatedly
[highlighted](https://news.usni.org/2018/04/24/sasc-confirms-davidson-nomination-next-pacom-commander)
the threat posed by Chinese military activities in the South China Sea
and promised to resist them vigorously. "Once \[the South China Sea
islands are\] occupied, China will be able to extend its influence
thousands of miles to the south and project power deep into Oceania," he
[warned](https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Davidson_APQs_04-17-18.pdf).
"The PLA \[People's Liberation Army\] will be able to use these bases to
challenge US presence in the region, and any forces deployed to the
islands would easily overwhelm the military forces of any other South
China Sea claimants. In short, China is now capable of controlling the
South China Sea in all scenarios short of war with the United States."

### Rise = Peaceful

#### Multipolar transition happening and it will be peaceful 

**Layne 18** (CHRISTOPHER LAYNE;  Robert M. Gates Chair in Intelligence
and National Security at the George Bush School of Government and Public
Service at Texas A&M University; The US--Chinese power shift and the end
of the Pax Americana; January 2018)

The coming end of the Pax Americana The fate of international orders is
closely linked to power transition dynamics. Throughout modern
international history the prevailing international order has reflected
the balance of power that existed at the time of its creation. [When
that balance changes sufficiently, the old order will be replaced by a
new one]{.underline}. Viewed from this perspective, what are the Pax
Americana's prospects? [How will China's rise, and America's decline,
affect the international order in the years ahead]{.underline}? [The
surprising answer given by **top US security studies scholars** is:
'**Not much**]{.underline}.' The United States, so the argument goes,
can 'lock in' the Pax Americana's essential features, including its
rules, norms and institutions.65 John Ikenberry, Stephen Brooks and
William Wohlforth are the leading proponents of the lock-in thesis.
Ikenberry was the first to set out the concept, arguing in After victory
that a hegemon, by building an institutionalized, rules-based
international order, 'can lock-in favorable arrangements that continue
beyond the zenith of its power'.66 In other words, [the international
order can remain intact even after the hegemonic power that created it
has lost its pre-eminent position in the international political
system]{.underline}. On this point, Ikenberry echoes Robert Keohane's
argument in After hegemony that, once a liberal international order has
been established by a hegemonic power, if the hegemon declines [it is
possible for a small group of Great Powers to take the place of the
former hegemon and collectively manage the international
system]{.underline}.67 That is, under certain conditions '[hegemonic
stability' can exist even if there is no hegemonic power]{.underline}.
In Liberal Leviathan, Ikenberry built on this logic to argue that, even
if the Pax Americana were to wither completely, the LRBIO would
nevertheless survive. As Ikenberry put it: 'America's position in the
global system may decline but the international order it leads can
remain the dominating logic of the twenty-first century.'68 Ikenberry's
view seems to have evolved, however. In jointly authored articles in
International Security and Foreign Affairs, Brooks, Ikenberry and
Wohlforth embrace hegemonic stability theory.69 That is, they contend
that, like all international orders, the post-1945 international order
does, in fact, require a hegemonic power to maintain it---and not just
any hegemon, but the United States. The logic of their argument is that
the LRBIO and the Pax Americana are one and the same, and that US
pre-eminence is a necessary condition for the LRBIO. According to them,
the United States must exercise 'global leadership'---the US foreign
policy establishment's code phrase for hegemony---by acting as a
security provider and geopolitical stabilizer; by maintaining an open,
liberal international economy; and by promoting global cooperation
through upholding and revising the post-1945 liberal order---which is
both 'institutional and normative'---created by the Pax Americana.70
They also claim that the post-1945 Pax Americana 'allows the United
States to ... wrap its hegemonic rule in a rules-based order'.71 This
helps to conceal the actual motives of self-interest and realpolitik
that underlie American hegemony. Read together, the International
Security and Foreign Affairs articles by Brooks, Ikenberry and Wohlforth
make clear the authors' view that the post-1945 LRBIO is inextricably
linked to US hegemony; that is, to the Pax Americana. This is in keeping
with the common understanding of hegemonic stability theory. As they see
it, the post-1945 international order based on American pre-eminence
'has served the US well for the past six decades and there is no reason
to give it up now'.72 The argument has special force given that,
according to the--- correct---logic of their argument (and of hegemonic
stability theory), if American hegemony goes, the LRBIO goes with it. In
their preference for maintaining the post-1945 hegemonic American
international order, Brooks, Ikenberry and Wohlforth echo the renowned
late nineteenthcentury British statesman Lord Salisbury. Presiding over
a hegemonic Britain that was already perceptibly declining, he famously
said: 'Whatever happens will be for the worse. Therefore, it is in our
interest that as little should happen as possible.' The post-1945
international order is (or was) a concrete manifestation of America's
hegemonic status. So, of course, the US foreign policy establishment
wants as little change as possible in international politics. Why would
it wish otherwise, when change would inevitably be both the cause and
effect of diminishing American power and influence? The United States
has every incentive for wanting to prolong the post-1945 international
order. After all, for most of the last 70 years or so, the US has
occupied the geopolitical penthouse ('when America ruled the world').
From that lofty height, however, the only direction it can go is down.
The lock-in strategy is seductive because it holds out (or appears to
hold out) the possibility that the United States can preserve the status
quo---the post-1945 international order---even as the geopolitical
status quo of American hegemony is changing. Lock-in is
attractive---superficially---because it assumes that China's rise will
not effect a major change in the international system. Specifically,
lock-in holds that China's rise can be managed by integrating it into
the post-1945 international order, and ensuring that the exercise of
Chinese power takes place within that order's rules and institutions.73
By doing so, it is claimed, the United States can offset its declining
power and 'ensure the international order it leads can remain the
dominating logic of the twenty-first century'.74 Lock-in assumes that
China has no interest in overturning---or significantly modifying---the
post-1945 international order in which it rose and became wealthy.
Certainly, China did rise within the Pax Americana's LRBIO. However,
China did not rise to preserve that American-dominated order. For some
three decades (beginning with Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms) [China
took a low profile in international politics, and avoided confrontation
both with the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and with its
regional neighbours]{.underline}. [Integration into the open
international economy spurred China's rapid growth]{.underline}. China's
self-described 'peaceful rise' followed the script written by Deng
Xiaoping: 'Lie low. Hide your capabilities. Bide your time.' However,
the fact that China bandwagoned with the United States in joining the
international economic order did not mean that its longer-term intention
was---or is---to preserve the post-1945 international order. In joining
the liberal economic order, Beijing's goal was not simply to get rich;
by integrating itself into the post-1945 international order, China was
able to avoid conflict with the United States until it became wealthy
enough to acquire the military capabilities necessary to compete with
America for regional hegemony in east Asia.75 Judging from Xi Jinping's
policy pronouncements, China's days of biding its time and hiding its
capabilities are over. Lock-in proponents argue that even as the
Sino-American military and economic balance continues to tilt
increasingly in Beijing's favour, the post-1945 international order's
rules, institutions and norms will offset America's loss of hard power.
There is historical evidence that suggests this is wishful thinking.
Take the case of Britain after the Second World War. Despite the
dramatic weakening of Britain's economic and financial clout caused by
its efforts in the two world wars, after 1945 British leaders believed
that the United Kingdom could remain one of three major world powers. In
pursuit of this goal, they formulated their own version of lock-in. As
the historian John Darwin puts it, officials in London thought that by
transforming the Commonwealth, Britain could transition 'from an empire
of rule to an empire of influence'.76 Specifically, they believed that
'free from the authoritarian, acquisitive and exploitative traditions of
the old version of empire', the reconfigured Commonwealth 'would make
the British connection voluntary, democratic, and mutually
beneficial'.77 The reformed Commonwealth therefore would serve as the
institutional instrument of continuing British world power, within which
shared values and norms would bind Britain's former colonies and
dominions to London's leadership.78 The reasons why British policy
makers bought into this vision sound an awful lot like the reasons why
the presentday American proponents of lock-in think it will preserve the
United States' global leadership even as its hard power erodes. Lock-in
did not work for Britain following the Second World War, and there is
scant reason to think it will work for the United States in the coming
years of the twenty-first century. The lock-in strategy also assumes
that if the Pax Americana's institutions are reformed, Beijing (and
other non-western emerging powers) will find it more attractive to
remain in the post-1945 international order than to overturn it. That
assumption, however, is logically flawed: achieving lock-in by reforming
the existing international order presumes that the United States can
have its cake (preserving the Pax Americana) and eat it too (reforming
the current international system's legacy institutions). But, as we all
know, when the cake is eaten, it's gone. Reform---at least, any kind of
reform that would appeal to China---would mean the United States
yielding significant power in international institutions to accommodate
Beijing. However, doing so would reduce US ability to shape outcomes,
diminish Washington's voice in international institutions, and impose
constraints on US autonomy in foreign and domestic policy.79 As
University of Birmingham lecturer Sevasti-Eleni Vezirgiannidou observes
with respect to institutional reform: 'It is questionable whether this
will really preserve US influence or rather, on the contrary, diminish
it, as the United States will have to share power in a reformed order
and thus will be restricted in its ability to act unilaterally.'80 [The
US foreign policy establishment may talk the talk of reforming the
international order]{.underline} (and the institutions that underpin
it), [but it is doubtful it will walk the walk with respect to
reform]{.underline}, because [that would mean accepting a downsized
American role in international politics]{.underline}. On the contrary,
Washington's opposition to the AIIB indicates that the United States is
not prepared to see its influence in the international order diminished.
And, with respect to reforming the post-1945 international order to
accommodate the reality of a risen China, this is the nub of the
problem: **[instead of preserving the Pax Americana, reform would lead
to changes in the international order that would undermine
it]{.underline}**. Of course, regardless of whether there is
institutional reform, the coming decades are likely to witness major
changes in the international order irrespective of America's
preferences.

### china rise peaceful

Even from Realists, [we can observe the opinion China as a **rising
peace**]{.underline}. Considering that China is a rising hegemon and the
USA is a hegemon one; we can buy K N. Waltz's (pp. 881ff) argument of
stable bipolar world as opposed to multipolar or unipolar. Therefore,
[in addition to its own peaceful rising behaviour, **China's rise will
not be taken as a threat** rather a potential force for a better
peaceful and stable world by the time it equates itself with the present
hegemon: creating equilibrium. China's peaceful rise can also be argued
from its own benefits side. Nations whose populations **benefit from
bilateral trade** will have a powerful reason to remain at
peace.]{.underline} The widening acceptance of market mechanisms and the
deepening of regional economic ties should go a long way towards
counterbalancing any residual inclination towards conflict. [Countries
that are busy trading with one another are far **less likely to go to
war**]{.underline}. (Richardson, Cossa and Khanna, in Friedberd p.3)
What can we buy from this argument? China, more than any country else,
knows how peaceful co-existence brings wealth and development via trade.
If it threats other countries or others see its growth as a threat,
China might lose more than it gains. [China is happy the way it is
going. China has no reason to change its direction to be a threat. So,
other countries will also be deemed to consider it as is.]{.underline}
From R. Uriu's (pp. 388-389) export-led peace perspective, which country
is to see China as a threat? Uriu suggests that all of this tremendous
focus on exports (and international economic exchange more broadly) has
made East Asia into a zone of amity. China is here playing a leading
actor. [Almost all countries from all corners of the world, even Japan,
need China's peaceful rise. Is the major debtor and trade partner -- the
U.S. -- to see its main creditor's rise as a threat]{.underline}? For
one thing, [**China needs to be seen as peaceful force** from US
perspective for the formers huge stake in the latter one]{.underline}.
For another thing, which part of China is really a threat to theU.S.?
[China's economy though fast developing is far behind the U.S. Aside
nuclear power, **U.S.' immense military** might and overall science,
technology and intelligence capabilities are unparalleled with any
country including the PRC.]{.underline} (The following website compares
US-China military power --
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12154991> accessed on
February 9, 2011 ) Friedberg (p.3) summarizes how liberals place great
faith on international institutions on. [Despite the absence of strong
and well rooted economic or security institution]{.underline} （like
EU）in the region to grudge against China's threat (if any), the
emergence of the likes of APEC and ARF are of enormous help in providing
regular communication, forum for discussion, negotiation, establish
rules of acceptable behavior, and promote cooperation between nations.
If so, [**Chinas rise will not be seen as a threat** in the region so
far as the institution also guides China. Its neighbors and other trade
partners cannot see China's rise a threat]{.underline}. We can
substantiate this argument seen from two perspectives. One, [economic
interdependence and trade-expectation theory.]{.underline} D. Copeland's
(pp. 334ff),dictates that as partners heavily depend on peaceful, open
and free trade and investment, the big China equally needs their
partnership. [The more it grows, the more it needs their partnership to
satisfy its big 'belly'. It's going to trade with them not with the
planet Mars. **There is no way to think that tomorrow's China is a
threat to the region or the world**.]{.underline} B. Womack (p. 548)
tells us that [China's asymmetrical relationship with its small
neighbouring states, ironically, develops the credibility of its image
as a **peaceful, cooperative and inclusive partner**]{.underline}. Even
in the face of global rivalry, China's best policy would be to continue
its current directions by renewing commitments on the part of its
leadership and developing an awareness of the importance of solidarity
with less powerful states. (ibid) Two, history will repeat itself:
[Asia's past will be Asia's future]{.underline}. (S. Huntington, p.238)
[Asians accept hierarchy and they regard a clear ordering of relations
as the key to domestic and international tranquility.]{.underline}(D.
Kang pp.167, 177ff; Mahbubani, p.117) Such attitudes may well have
rooted in Confucianism. Whereas in Europe the dispersal of strength and
the insistence on autonomy went hand in hand, in Asia a heavy
concentration of capabilities has encouraged an inclination towards
deference and an acceptance of Chinese hegemony. (Friedberg, p.5) In
this connection, according to S. Huntington (p.234), for 2,000 years,
East Asian international relations were Sinocentric. [Most of the other
states in the region have long traditions of either cooperating with or
being subordinate to China. He suggests that similar patterns may well
prevail in the future. With the rap**id rise of Chinese power**, he
predicts the other Asian states will have to choose between power
balanced to the price of conflict and **peace secured at the price of
hegemony**. History, culture, and the realities strongly suggest that
**Asia will opt for peace** and hegemony power.]{.underline} D. Kang (p.
183) emphatically argues [it is Chinese weakness not Chinese rise that
has to be considered a threat]{.underline} esp. to the region. Hence,
(again) [China rise is peaceful and a happy end for the
region.]{.underline} Base on preponderance as opposed to absolute
reasoning, although the side arguing China's rise as a threat has more
than few grains of truth; generally speaking, I stand on the side of
some leaders like US President Obama and Ethiopian PM. Meles side who
are equally impressed by the other very strong side: [CHINA'S RISE IS
PEACEFUL!]{.underline}

### AT: China Rise Bad

#### China collapse is fundamentally worse than China Rise -- Any argument China rise bad is based on fear-mongering and xenophobic basis 

BY MING **XIA** **2018** 4/9 \"China Threat\" or a \"Peaceful Rise of
China\"?
https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/ref/college/coll-china-politics-007.html

[Will China become a threat to the United States, Japan, and surrounding
countries]{.underline}? The [reason for American concern mainly arises
from its hegemonic status in the world politics and the ideological
incompatibility of China with the Western value system]{.underline}.
[China\'s]{.underline} stunning economic growth has convinced the West
that it is just a matter of time until China becomes a world superpower.
But its [ideological orientation makes China a revolutionary power that
is threatening both to the United States\' status and global structure.
Three different logics have been constructed to substantiate the \"China
threat\" thesis]{.underline}. [First, ideological and cultural factors
make China a threat]{.underline}. For neo-conservatives in the Bush
Administration, [the mere factor that China still sticks to communism
makes view it adversely]{.underline}. [Samuel Huntington has added a
cultural factor: in the clash of civilizations, the \"unholy alliance
between Islamic and Confucian civilizations\" is the most fundamental
threat to the West]{.underline}. For people using this logic, the
sensible response from the U.S. is, in the short run, a containment
policy, and confrontation is possible if needed; in the long run, the
promotion of a peaceful transformation within China[. Second,
geopolitical and geoeconomic factors. For many realists, even China has
shed off its ideological straitjacket, as a great power in size
(territory, population, and economy), China has to pursue its own
interest and respect]{.underline}. Nationalism may still drive China
into a course of clash with the United States, if the latter refuses to
accommodate or share the leadership with China as a rising power. Some
scholars fear that democracy can unleash strong nationalism and popular
nationalism can make China even more aggressive toward the United
States. [Third, the collapse of China. Opposed to the previous two
perspectives, some people are concerned that if China suffers a
Soviet-style sudden-death syndrome and spins out of control, it can
create an even worse scenario. The sheer size of the population makes
refuge problem, the failed state and the followed crises (warlordism,
civil war, crime, proliferation of nuclear weapons, etc) impossible for
the world to deal with.]{.underline} Due to these three different
considerations, the United States often oscillates from demonization to
romaticization of China, from containment to engagement. The U.S.-China
relationship has shifted from conflict, to confrontation, to competition
and back to conflict, but so rarely features with cooperation. One
American China specialist characterizes the bilateral relationship as
\"the sweet-and-sour Sino-American relationship.\"

### China Rise Inevitable 

#### China Rise is inevitable---its only a question whether it will be antagonistic or cooperative---root factor is Taiwan

**Jisi et al. 17** (Wang Jisi, July 2017, "China-US Relations: Exploring
a New Pathway to A Win-win Partnership", Jisi is the President of the
Institute of International and Strategic Studies at Peking Strategy,
Chinese Side Report Exploring EN,
<https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/event/170705_Chinese_Side_Report_Exploring_EN.pdf>)

China's Taiwan policy can be summed up as "one country, two systems"
with the goal of peaceful reunification. So long as the Taiwanese
authorities do not pursue independence, the Mainland is willing to
consider cross-Strait reconciliation. The [[Taiwan issue is the result
of U.S. interference in China's internal affairs]{.mark}, and [China
believes the United States plays the Taiwan card as a means of
containing China]{.mark}]{.underline}. Current U.S. policy toward Taiwan
is facing tremendous challenges given the drastic changes in the balance
of power across the Taiwan Strait, the Mainland's remarkable rise, and
political turbulence within Taiwan. Will the United States restrain
Taiwanese independence or once again indulge the Taiwanese authorities
in provoking a crisis? China's overall policy on these issues remains
fundamentally unchanged. Chinese [[President Xi Jinping]{.mark}
repeatedly [stressed a policy of "sovereignty belongs to China, set
aside differences, and promote joint development" and]{.mark} to "[stay
committed to a peaceful approach, resolve disputes through negotiations,
and strive for peace and stability]{.mark}]{.underline}." Both nations
need to explore the possibility of peaceful coexistence and
co-development from a strategic perspective. As a traditional land power
developing its naval capabilities, China's maritime strategy must be a
regional one; and as a maritime power coming onshore, America's maritime
strategy must be a global one. The United States needs to adjust its
strategic goals in the Asia-Pacific region. The major difference between
the two nations in the Asia-Pacific region is seen in [[China's efforts
to uphold its sovereignty, maritime rights and interests, and America's
efforts 35 to maintain its own maritime dominance in the
region.]{.underline}]{.mark} A cool-headed United States needs to
recognize that so long as China continues to rise, the balance of power
in the Asia-Pacific region will shift. The [[United States must
recognize China's rise and its maritime aspirations]{.mark}, give due
space and status to China, [and avoid inflaming nationalistic sentiments
in Chin]{.mark}a. The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [should give up
its attempt to build an alliance system against China in this
region]{.mark}]{.underline}. It should also recognize and encourage
China to make more contributions to economic growth, freedom of
navigation, and regional stability.

relationship with China",
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00963402.2019.1555992)

Between the public accusations and [the **huge** planned **US** nuclear
arms modernization programs]{.underline}, the administration has
[created **new perceptions** in China of a **renewed** and strident US
nuclear **threat**]{.underline}, further [complicating the bilateral
nuclear relationship.]{.underline} But [the world can
ill-afford]{.underline} such [**deep** **mutual**
**suspicions**]{.underline} between two nuclear weapon powers, if we
want [to minimize the **risk** of a **nuclear war**]{.underline} or a
nuclear arms race. Maintaining a stable nuclear relationship requires
effort from both countries. But because [China's]{.underline}
nuclear-weapon [strategy is primarily **focused on reacting to and
deterring potential** US **nuclear strikes**]{.underline}, what
[Washington]{.underline} does to manage this nuclear relationship [will
be the **most significant** external **factor** on Beijing's nuclear
thinking and policy-making]{.underline}. With that in mind, here are
some suggestions on what the United State can do at its end, to tone
down the situation, stop things from getting out of control, and help to
avoid Cold War 2.0. From my research at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for
Global Policy, there are essentially five major elements involved if the
United States is to reach this goal. The United States must: lead by
doing (and demonstrate the right values); try to get a more accurate
understanding of China; find a common framework for maintaining nuclear
stability; start by reducing shared risks; and help China better
understand US policy. Let us examine each one in turn. Lead by
demonstrating the right values The United States has long been an
acknowledged leader in nuclear arms control and nonproliferation. But
its leadership in this area is seriously undercut by its latest Nuclear
Posture Review, which failed to use this once-in-an-administration
opportunity to promote these fundamental values and send the right
policy signals to other countries, such as China. Most notably, this NPR
reverses the previous policy of promoting nuclear arms control. It no
longer de-emphasizes the role of nuclear weapons in US national security
strategy, but instead does the opposite -- [promoting the development of
**new** nuclear **capabilities**, re-emphasizing low-yield tactical
nuclear weapons, abandoning the goal of making the "sole purpose" of
nuclear weapons be to deter nuclear attacks, and broadening the number
of non-nuclear attack scenarios]{.underline} which might lead to a
nuclear response by the United States. The new NPR also explicitly
renounces the idea of ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
(CTBT). This renewed interest in enhancing the role of nuclear weapons
effectively [**undoes** eight-**years of effort**]{.underline} by the
Obama administration [to convince]{.underline} the [experts of China and
other countries that the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is
sincere in its goal of promoting nuclear arms control and ridding the
world of nuclear risks]{.underline}. (Despite China's suspicion of such
proclaimed US intentions, the Obama administration had been making
headway. Any of that progress, however, was essentially lost as a result
of the policy reversal by the Trump administration.) Most troublesome,
the [new]{.underline} NPR reinforces the ["peace through strength"
doctrine]{.underline} advocated by President Trump. This policy is
problematic because it [sends the **message** that every country should
feel fine to pursue its own version of peace by building up its own
strength]{.underline}. The underlying difficulty is that [countries
disagree about what global peace should look like, influenced
by]{.underline} their own [perceived interests and
ideologies]{.underline}. But "peace through strength" basically calls
for countries to put aside their efforts to bridge their disagreements,
and instead settle issues through the [accumulation of, and
demonstration of, force]{.underline}. Unfortunately, the new Nuclear
Posture Review promotes this very principle of power politics. This
document states that a strong nuclear force "ensur\[es\] that our
diplomats continue to speak from a position of strength on matters of
war and peace," [and by doing so it embraces the notion that nuclear
power translates into diplomatic leverage]{.underline} -- and that the
United States seeks to pursue its foreign policy goals by waving its
nuclear weapons around (US Defense Department 2018). [This notion
corresponds with the increasingly loud voices of nationalist groups
within China, who believe that nuclear weapons are what]{.underline}
will [ultimately win]{.underline} China [international respect and make
other countries]{.underline} -- especially the United States -- [treat
China fairly and equally]{.underline} (Global Times 2017). [Such voices
**will** become louder and stronger **as a result** of the US government
supporting the same viewpoint]{.underline}. Consequently, [this view is
**driving domestic calls** in China to **greatly expand** China's
**nuclear arsenal** -- to build a nuclear force]{.underline} that is
"commensurate to" China's international status in the world (Global
Times 2016). [It also has the unfortunate consequence of promoting a
**cynical understanding** about international politics among members of
China's security **policy community**]{.underline}: Namely, that
super-powers only pay lip service to international norms and democratic
values; at the end of the day, the real rule is that might makes right.
***[This is bad news]{.underline}*** not only **[for]{.underline}**
managing the US-China nuclear relationship but for containing the
***[overall]{.underline}*** bilateral ***[geopolitical
competition]{.underline}*** as well. Similarly, when the US Nuclear
Posture Review declares that "\[e\]nsuring our nuclear deterrent remains
strong will provide the best opportunity for convincing other nuclear
powers to engage in meaningful arms control initiatives," China reads
this as more evidence of the United States' advancing foreign policy
goals not by soft power that inspires and persuades -- such as its
leading by example in promoting universal values -- but through
demonstrations of hard power that coerces and compels, such as the
flexing of military muscle in resolving international disputes. This
approach is ultimately self-defeating for the United States, because
China feels rather confident today about its capability to avoid defeat
in an arms competition. Consequently, soft rather than hard power has a
far better chance of convincing China to engage in meaningful arms
control initiatives. Furthermore, the 2018 NPR emphasizes that the
United States has the option of responding to non-nuclear strategic
attacks with nuclear means -- and it ensures that its [definition of
strategic attacks worthy of nuclear response by the United States are
vague, broad-ranging, and **open-ended**]{.underline}. According to the
NPR, non-nuclear strategic attacks include not only attacks on nuclear
weapon systems and their enabling capabilities, but also "attacks on the
U.S., allied, or partner civilian population or infrastructure." On top
of that, "the United States reserves the right to make any adjustment"
about what constitutes a non-nuclear strategic attack. This deliberately
undefined statement about the [use of nuclear weapons]{.underline}, from
the most advanced conventional military power in the world, [makes it
**inevitable**]{.underline} that some other [nuclear weapons
states]{.underline} would [ask: Why shouldn't we]{.underline} make more
out of our nuclear weapons and [relax our restraint]{.underline} on
nuclear use, given our less-advanced conventional capabilities? This is
not helpful when some Chinese experts are already asking for China to
broaden its nuclear use scenarios (Qiao 2014). Try to get a more
accurate understanding of china The Trump administration has given China
the highest level of attention in the history of US nuclear posture
reviews, and the 2018 NPR dedicates an entire subsection to delineating
a "tailored strategy for China." But an important part of this strategy
is based on the premise that China intends to conduct "limited nuclear
use" first in a conventional conflict with the United States. The
problem is that [there is **no credible evidence** to suggest that China
wishes to "secure an advantage" through the limited first use of nuclear
weapons in a conventional war]{.underline}. On the contrary, [Chinese
**military planners** seem to have **incorporated** the country's
**unconditional
n**]{.underline}o-**[f]{.underline}**irst-**[u]{.underline}**se [policy
**deeply** in their military thinking, policy-making, and operational
training. Admittedly, some Chinese scholars have argued for making
China's n]{.underline}o-**[f]{.underline}**irst-**[u]{.underline}**se
[policy conditional, but so far this is a **minority view** that has not
been able to influence the long-standing official policy of
unconditional no-first-use (Zhenqiang 2016). Thus, the]{.underline}
[United States appears to be accusing China of employing a "limited
nuclear use" strategy that Chinese **officials and mainstream**
**experts** genuinely do not endorse]{.underline}. For the NPR to then
pledge to develop more low-yield **[t]{.underline}**actical
**[n]{.underline}**uclear **[w]{.underline}**eapon[s]{.underline} to
counter a hypothetical threat [makes it easy for
**suspicious**]{.underline} Chinese [**experts** to conclude that the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [**is** merely
**generating an excuse** to build up its nuclear warfighting
capability]{.underline} (Xianrong and Min 2018).

Andrew J Nathan, professor of Chinese politics at Columbia University,
writes that the Five Principles of [Peaceful Coexistence offer an
alternative to the US-led world order]{.underline}, where international
institutions often reflect US interests and values. [This Chinese
alternative would allow nations to govern their own political
systems]{.underline} and people as they see fit, and stresses that all
nations are equal to do so [without interference]{.underline}. For
example, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council,
China has commonly vetoed or abstained from voting on resolutions that
require intervention or sanctions. Jane Golley, China expert at the
Australian National University, told the ABC it is \"natural and
expected\" for an emerging superpower like China to create plans to
protect its own interests. Dr Golley said the militarisation of [the
South China Sea]{.underline} \"[does not]{.underline} inherently
[contradict a peaceful development]{.underline}\", explaining that [it
is a security measure]{.underline} [to ensure shipping lanes would be
open]{.underline} in the event of war. \"[The costs of war would take
away from China\'s economic gains]{.underline},\" she said. \"What
[China is]{.underline} pursuing is [economic power]{.underline}, and
investment [and]{.underline} economics is inherently
[peace]{.underline}ful.\" Dr Golley added that \"American
assertiveness\" has led China --- under President Xi --- to build up its
military \"in line with its economic power\". \"[Why wouldn\'t a rising
power prepare a contingency in the event of a conflict with a
superpower]{.underline}?\" However, while [China pursues a peaceful
foreign policy]{.underline} unless provoked, domestically it is a
different story, she said. \"Beijing is enacting policies which are
certainly worrying,\" Dr Golley told the ABC. \"You see it in Hong Kong,
Xinjiang and within its own borders, but [I\'m yet to see]{.underline}
comprehensive evidence of [aggression overseas]{.underline}.\" A former
Defence Force chief says [in our lifetimes, our economy will be
devastated, our land seized, our system of government
upended.]{.underline} Dr Monk emphasised [it is important to keep a
\"cool head]{.underline}\" about [comparing China\'s rise to
it]{.underline}s great power [predecessors.]{.underline} He said [the
world\'s former superpowers]{.underline} --- including Europe\'s
colonial powers and Japan --- [have]{.underline} previously [risen
through]{.underline} \"[an unprecedented catastrophe]{.underline}\".
These include world wars or the mass enslavement of peoples. \"[The
possibility of]{.underline} \[[similar conflict]{.underline}\] occurring
in the 21st century [as a result of China\'s rise is
non-existent]{.underline},\" Dr Monk told the ABC. \"\[[China\]
has]{.underline} become integrated as a late starter in [a
mature]{.underline} international [system of trade and
investment]{.underline}, and [if it messes that system up it would
suffer egregiously.\"]{.underline}

WASHINGTON, Oct. 30 (Xinhua) [\-- A former U.S. senior diplomat said
here on Tuesday that **China is not a revisionist** country in the
current international system, and interests of the United States and
China are **not fundamentally incompati**ble]{.underline}. [Susan
Thornton, former acting assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific Affairs]{.underline}, made the remarks while attending a debate
whether the long-term interests of the United States and China are
fundamentally incompatible. [The Trump administration, in its national
security strategy, labeled China and Russia as U.S. competitors and
revisionist nations]{.underline}. Its recent trade and diplomatic
provocations against China have triggered widespread fear that
Washington is re-directing and shrinking its engagement with Beijing.
Thornton said that [the United States and China \"both have an
**interest in the continuation** of the **international
system**]{.underline},\" while noting that the two countries are both
permanent members of the UN Security Council. \"In this respect, I would
argue that [China is not revisionist, that China sees itself as wanting
to prolong and continue the existing international order albeit with
some changes]{.underline},\" she said. While holding the view that the
interests of the United States and China are not fundamentally
incompatible, Thornton said [there are ways to manage the differences
via **diplomacy**. \"We have many interests in common with China, and
some of these are at a level of abstraction beyond which we normally
think]{.underline},\" she said. \"China and the U.S. are both interested
in countering instability and conflict among regional hotspots,\" she
said. \"[They are both interested in countering terrorism and extremism,
countering large migrations of populations, pandemics, **environmental
and natural disasters**, and other sources of instability, and problems
in the world]{.underline}.\" \"Promoting prosperity for both of our
countries and other countries in the globe is an obvious common
interest,\" she argued. As the two largest economies on the planet, the
[United States and China share **interconnectedness in their economies**
which is important to both of the countries as well as the whole
world]{.underline}, according to Thornton. \"While it is true that some
of our interests are in conflict \... they must be managed through
deterrence and diplomacy; while other interests are compatible and can
be furthered with diplomacy and cooperation,\" she said. [All of the
issues between the two nations regarding incompatibilities \"can be
worked on so that they become either manageable or less
problematic]{.underline},\" she added. \"[It is not to say that there
won\'t be tension in the relationship and that this tension could be
actually constructive, but issues that may seem intractable, such as
some of those we worked on with China in the past]{.underline} \... we
have successfully managed and we have successfully gotten progress on,\"
Thornton said. [Noting the economic and **environmental challenges**
that the world is facing]{.underline}, Thornton said \"[without
**U.S.-China cooperation**, we will not be able to affect any progress
for the future of our future generations]{.underline}.\" The debate is
part of a string of events on U.S.-China relations co-hosted by the John
L. Thornton China Center at Brookings Institution and the Paul Tsai

[Not surprisingly, China's advances are discomfiting to Washington.
Still, the United States is starting from a position of unusual,
unnatural dominance.]{.underline} Indeed, when the Red Navy rusted away
in port after the Soviet Union dissolved, the waters up to China's coast
became a de facto American lake. Now, however, notes the Defense
Department, "[[China]{.mark} increasingly [seeks to leverage]{.mark} its
growing economic, diplomatic, and military **[clout]{.mark}** to
establish regional preeminence and expand its international influence."
[There's nothing nefarious about that]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Shifting
power]{.mark} balances [are inevitable]{.mark} as nations rise and fall.
Such [changes do not threaten]{.mark} American [security]{.mark}. U.S.
[influence]{.mark}, [dominance, and hegemony]{.mark}, yes, but none of
those is necessary to ensure American peace and prosperity]{.underline}.
The United States grew dramatically while still an international
nonentity. Washington's increasing intervention in other regions
actually put the country at much greater risk. Some believe that China
wants more than international influence. For instance, Steve Bannon has
claimed that Beijing seeks to be "the global hegemonic power." That's
possible, but he offered no evidence. [Importantly, there is no
ideological contest for hearts and minds, as during the Cold War. China
has dropped the pretense of promoting communism; the party is just a
cynical means for leadership to retain power.]{.underline} [[Nor does
Chinese foreign policy evince]{.mark} an appetite for [global
conquest]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Beijing has grown more
assertive, even aggressive, in its territorial claims, but all of those
are historically grounded, even if legally unpersuasive. Virtually all
the issues---Taiwan, the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, the Paracel/Xisha
Islands, the Spratly/Nansha Islands---spring from the Chinese Empire's
extraordinary weakness. [So far there have been [no demands that
threaten]{.mark} other [nations' independence]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Most important, China's concept of "active defense" is primarily
designed to frustrate U.S. intervention, not facilitate conquest of
American (or other) territory]{.underline}. For instance, the Pentagon
acknowledges that "PLA capabilities and concepts in development are
strengthening China's anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) and power
projection capabilities." Beijing is more interested in being able to
sink American ships with missiles and torpedoes than produce Chinese
carriers for an armada to seize Los Angeles.

### AT: US-China War Inescapable

#### The war is not inescapable -- China is too far off to surpass US primacy in the region -- US containment is the only trigger to aggressive competition between the two countries

The United States is a deeply polarized nation, yet one view
increasingly spans the partisan divide: the country is at imminent risk
of being overtaken by China. Unless Washington does much more to counter
the rise of its biggest rival, many argue, it may soon lose its status
as the world's leading power. According to this [emerging
consensus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/left-and-right-agree-get-tough-on-china-1515458432),
decades of U.S. investment and diplomatic concessions have helped create
a geopolitical monster. China now boasts the world's largest economy and
military, and it is using its growing might to set its own rules in East
Asia, hollow out the U.S. economy, and undermine democracy around the
globe. In response, many Democrats and Republicans agree, the United
States must ramp up its military presence in Asia, slap
[tariffs](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/opinion/trump-tariffs-economics.html)
on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese goods, and challenge
China's influence worldwide. But this emerging consensus is wrong and
the policy response misguided. [China is not about to overtake the
United States economically or militarily]{.underline}---quite to the
contrary. [By the most important measures of national wealth and
power]{.underline}, **[China is struggling to keep up and
will]{.underline}** probably [**fall further behind** in the coming
decades]{.underline}. [The United States]{.underline} is and [will
remain the world's sole superpower for the foreseeable
future]{.underline}, [provided that it avoids overextending itself
abroad or underinvesting at home]{.underline}. **[The greatest risk for
U.S. strategy]{.underline}**, accordingly, **[lies]{.underline}** not in
doing too little but **[in overreacting to fears of Chinese ascent and
American decline]{.underline}**. Instead of hyping China's rise and
gearing up for a new Cold War, [Washington should take more modest steps
to reinforce the existing balance of power]{.underline} in East Asia
[and reinvigorate the U.S. economy]{.underline}. To keep the peace,
[U.S. leaders should seek to engage]{.underline} rather than alienate
[Beijing]{.underline}, safe in the knowledge that long-term geopolitical
trends will favor the United States. MEASURING WHAT MATTERS [The main
piece of evidence typically cited for China's supposedly inexorable rise
is its]{.underline} large gross domestic product ([GDP]{.underline}),
along with various other statistics that are essentially sub-components
of GDP, including industrial and manufacturing output; trade and
financial flows; and spending on military, research and development
(R&D), and infrastructure. These **[gross indicators]{.underline}**,
however, [are terrible measures of a country's power]{.underline}. As I
show in a [new
book](https://www.amazon.com/Unrivaled-America-Superpower-Cornell-Security/dp/1501724789/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1537471572&sr=8-1&keywords=Michael+beckley),
they [fail to track the rise and fall of great powers over the past 200
years **and perform little better than a coin toss**]{.underline} [at
predicting the winners and losers of international disputes and
wars.]{.underline} In fact, by these very measures, China was at the top
once before: in the nineteenth century, [China **had** the world's
largest economy and the largest military]{.underline}. It also ran a
trade surplus with other great powers. Yet many Chinese citizens today
think of this era as a "century of humiliation" during which [their
country lost huge chunks of territory and most of its sovereign rights
to smaller rivals]{.underline}, most notably the United Kingdom and
Japan. Similarly, nineteenth-century Russia had Europe's largest GDP and
military, but it suffered a series of crushing defeats by the United
Kingdom, France, and Germany that culminated in the collapse of the
Russian empire in 1917. In the last century, [the Soviet Union outpaced
the United States by most measures of gross resources, including
industrial output, military and R&D spending, and the number of troops,
nuclear weapons, scientists, and engineers. It still lost the Cold
War.]{.underline} These and hundreds of other cases illustrate a simple
but crucial point: gross indicators such as GDP and military spending
exaggerate the power of populous countries, because they count the
benefits of having a large workforce and a big military but not the
costs of having many people to feed, police, protect, and serve. A big
population is obviously an important asset. Luxembourg, for example,
will never be a major power, because its economy is a blip in world
markets and its military is smaller than Cleveland's police department.
But [a big population is no guarantee of great power, because people
both produce and consume resources]{.underline}. One billion peasants
will produce immense output, but they also will consume most of that
output on the spot, [leaving few resources left over for power
projection]{.underline} abroad. To become a superpower, by contrast, a
country needs to amass a large stock of economic and military resources.
To do this, in turn, it must be big and efficient at the same time---not
one or the other. It must not only mobilize vast inputs but also extract
as much as possible from these inputs. In short, a nation's power stems
not from its gross resources but from its net resources---the resources
left over after subtracting the costs of making them. [MIGHT MAKES
RIGHT, BUT WHAT MAKES MIGHT]{.underline}? The list of these costs is
long. For starters, there are production costs, which include the raw
materials consumed to generate wealth and military capabilities, as well
as any negative byproducts of that process (think pollution). Then, add
welfare costs---the expenses a nation pays to keep its people from dying
in the streets, including spending on food, health care, education, and
social security. Finally, there's the price of security: the government
has to police and protect its citizens from enemies foreign and
domestic. Needless to say, these costs add up. In fact, they usually
consume most of a nation's resources. [To get an accurate sense of a
country's overall power, then, analysts need to account for these
costs]{.underline}. In recent years, the [World
Bank](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/29001/9781464810466.pdf)
and the [United
Nations](http://www.ihdp.unu.edu/docs/Publications/Secretariat/Reports/SDMs/IWR_SDM_2014.pdf)
have taken up this task and published rough estimates of countries' net
stocks of resources. Their analyses focus on three areas: produced
capital (man-made items such as machines, buildings, fighter aircraft,
and software), human capital (the population's education, skills, and
working life span), and natural capital (water, energy resources, and
arable land). In addition, the investment bank [Credit
Suisse](https://www.credit-suisse.com/corporate/en/research/research-institute/global-wealth-report.html)
has published data on countries' net stocks of privately held wealth.
Although these three databases use different data and methods, they
largely paint the same picture: [the United States' net stocks of
resources are several times the size of China's, and its lead is growing
each year, possibly by trillions of dollars]{.underline}. It gets even
more astonishing. [These numbers are conservative estimates, because
they rely on Chinese government statistics, which exaggerate China's
output by as much as 30 percent]{.underline} and ignore numerous costs
that erode its wealth and military capabilities. [Chinese businesses,
for instance, use roughly two times more capital and **five times more
labor** than U.S. companies **to generate the same** level of
**output**. More than one-third of China's industrial capacity is
wasted. More than half of its R&D spending is stolen.]{.underline}
Nearly two-thirds of its infrastructure projects cost more to build than
they will ever generate in economic returns. [China also spends hundreds
of billions of dollars more than the United States every year to feed,
police, and provide social services to its population]{.underline}.
These same inefficiencies and barriers drag down China's military might.
On average, [**Chinese weapons** systems **are** roughly **half as
capable** as those of the United States in terms of range, firepower,
and accuracy. Chinese troops, pilots, and sailors lack combat experience
and receive less than half the training of their American
counterparts.]{.underline} Moreover, border defense and [internal
security consume at least 35 percent of China's military budget and bog
down half of its active-duty force, whereas the U.S. military enjoys a
secure home base and can focus almost entirely on power projection
abroad.]{.underline} The U.S. military, of course, disperses its assets
around the world, whereas China's are concentrated in East Asia, making
it a formidable regional power. But [the United States' military
presence in many far-flung corners of the globe is a matter of policy
preference rather than necessity, meaning that Washington can quickly
redeploy forces from one area to another without seriously jeopardizing
its security. China]{.underline}, by contrast, has to keep most of its
military on guard at home. For one, it suffers much higher levels of
domestic unrest than the United States. [It also shares sea or land
borders with 19 countries, five of which have fought wars against China
within the last century and **ten** of which **still claim parts of
Chinese territory as their own**.]{.underline} Crucially, [**many of
these countries have developed advanced** air, naval, and missile
**capabilities that could prevent China from establishing**]{.underline}
sea or air **[control in]{.underline}** most of the [**East China and
S**outh **C**hina **S**eas]{.underline}. In sum, the United States
maintains a huge economic and military lead over China. [To catch up,
China will need to grow its power resources faster. This, however, is a
long shot, not only given its massive debts, dwindling resources, and
rampant corruption but also because of its eroding work
force.]{.underline} By some estimates, China will lose a quarter of its
working-age population---more than 200 million workers---over the next
30 years, while the number of Chinese aged 65 years or older will more
than triple. As a result, [China's ratio of workers to retirees, which
today stands at seven to one, will shrink to two to one. In the same
period, the U.S. work force is expected to grow by 30
percent]{.underline} and the American worker-to-retiree ratio will
remain around three to one.

• Cooperation on climate change mitigation, adaptation, and consequence
management. [China-US cooperation will be **increasingly critical to the
global response to climate change**. New scientific studies warn that
the worst-case scenarios for climate change impacts are the most likely
outcomes]{.underline}. Scientific assessments also maintain that
anthropomorphic climate change is partly responsible for extreme weather
events that the world is already experiencing at an increasing rate,
from the floods in Pakistan and the heat wave in Russia to the melting
glaciers and ice sheets and the "superstorm" Sandy that inflicted
unprecedented destruction on New York and New Jersey. It is highly
likely that [global climate change will be a key issue in the coming two
decades as the world faces increasing climate-induced humanitarian
disasters and infrastructure destruction requiring immediate and
expensive relief as well as costly, long-term adaptation. Climate change
likely will increase social and political instability in many areas of
the world, including emerging economies and developed
countries]{.underline}. It also will likely renew political pressure for
emissions reductions, especially by China and the United States, the
world's two biggest emitters. [China-US cooperation in all these areas

[[For nearly a decade, the U.S. and China]{.underline}]{.mark}, the two
most powerful nations on the planet, [have [met]{.mark} every year to
talk about how to run the world]{.underline} together. When the talks
began in 2006, they focused on issues like currency-exchange rates,
trade barriers and China\'s never-ending disputes with Taiwan.
[[In]{.mark} [2009]{.mark}]{.underline}, shortly after Obama\'s

that a better understanding]{.mark} between the U.S. and China [would
lead to a better deal at]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[Copenhagen]{.underline}]{.mark} climate summit that year. (**[[It
didn\'t help]{.underline}]{.mark}** --
**[[mistrust]{.underline}]{.mark}** between the countries
**[[was]{.mark} a large part of the reason [why the talks]{.mark}
[imploded]{.mark}]{.underline}**.)∂ [[This year\'s]{.mark} U.S.

influential climate hawks]{.underline} -- Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz,
top climate negotiator Todd Stern and John Podesta, counselor to Obama,
who has become the administration\'s de facto point man for climate
policy. [This [is the]{.mark} diplomatic equivalent of a **[full-court
press]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In the past couple of years, [[Obama has
made]{.mark} some important [moves]{.mark}, including [investing
billions]{.mark} in clean energy[, jacking up]{.mark}]{.underline}
vehicle-[[efficiency standards]{.mark} [and proposing rules to
limit]{.mark} pollution from U.S. [coal]{.mark} plants. [But]{.mark}
climate change is a global issue. [Unless the West can persuade other
countries to take climate action seriously]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
[nothing any single nation does is going to matter]{.underline}]{.mark}
much when it comes to solving the problem.∂
**[[Except]{.underline}]{.mark}**, that is, [**[for

[likely [determine whether or not \[hu\]mankind can]{.mark}]{.underline}
halt -- or at least [[ameliorate]{.underline}]{.mark} -- [global
[warming]{.mark}. The view among a number of prominent climate
scientists is that [if China\'s emissions peak around 2025, we may --
just barely -- have a shot at stabilizing the]{.mark} [climate before
all hell breaks loose. But the Chinese have resisted]{.mark}
international pressure to curb their emissions]{.underline}. For years,
they have used the argument that they are poor, the West is rich, and
that the high levels of carbon in the atmosphere were caused by
America\'s and Europe\'s 200-year-long fossil­fuel binge. Climate change
is your problem, they argued -- you deal with it. But that logic
doesn\'t hold anymore. [China is set to become the largest economy in
the world]{.underline} this year, and in 2006, it passed the U.S. as the
planet\'s largest carbon polluter. [[China]{.mark} now [dumps 10 billion
tons]{.mark} of CO2 [into the atmosphere]{.mark} every year. [That
number is expected to grow]{.mark}]{.underline} to 15 billion tons by
2030, [dwarfing the pollution of the rest of the world]{.underline}.
**[[If that happens]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[then the chances that the
world will]{.mark} cut carbon pollution quickly enough to [avert

out a global climate agreement, it [[may be the **last best
chance**]{.mark} to address this problem]{.underline} before the Years
of Living Dangerously begin. Like other climate negotiations held under
the banner of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,
the Paris meeting is likely to be warped by 25-year-old grudges and a
profound sense of distrust. \"But right now, [Paris is the only game we
have]{.underline},\" one member of the State Department\'s climate team
told me. \"If it fails, [[there is no Plan B]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"∂ In
Beijing, one of Kerry\'s goals will be to find out all he can about
China\'s strategy for Paris -- what kind of commitment the Chinese might
make, how sincere they are, what tactics they will use.
[[But]{.underline}]{.mark} for Kerry, [[this is]{.mark} anything
**but**]{.underline} a [straightforward]{.underline} conversation,
because [it\'s **[twisted up in]{.mark} [the shadow play]{.mark}** [of
U.S.-China relations, which are marked by **suspicion**, **paranoia**
and]{.mark} **[saber rattling]{.mark}** on both sides as the U.S.
adjusts to China\'s rising power]{.underline} in the world. \"What we
are living through now is the end of 500 years of Western
predominance,\" historian Niall Ferguson has written. The issue is not
whether China will challenge America\'s dominance, but when and how.

### Warming = Conflict Multiplier

#### The impact is water wars, food riots, collapse of states and resource conflict produce a crisis on par with terrorism, cyber-war and nuclear proliferation.

Michael **Klare**, 4-22-20**13**, \"Will water supplies provoke World
War III?,\" Salon,
http://www.salon.com/2013/04/22/could_water_supplies_provoke_world_war_iii_partner/

Brace yourself. You may not be able to tell yet, but according to global
experts and the U.S. intelligence community, the earth is already
shifting under you. [Whether you know it or not, you're on a new planet,
a resource-shock world of a sort humanity has never before experienced.
[Two nightmare scenarios --- a global scarcity of vital resources and
the onset of extreme climate change]{.mark} --- are already beginning to
converge and in the coming decades are likely to [produce a tidal wave
of unrest, rebellion, competition, and conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Just what this tsunami of disaster will look like may, as yet, be hard
to discern, but experts warn of ["[water wars" over contested river
systems, global food riots]{.mark} sparked by soaring prices for life's
basics]{.underline}, mass migrations of climate refugees (with resulting
anti-migrant violence), and the [breakdown of social order or the
[collapse of states]{.mark}]{.underline}. At first, such mayhem is
likely to arise largely in Africa, Central Asia, and other areas of the
underdeveloped South, but in time [[all regions of the planet will be
affected]{.mark}.]{.underline} To appreciate the power of this
encroaching catastrophe, it's necessary to examine each of the forces
that are combining to produce this future cataclysm. Resource Shortages
and Resource Wars Start with one simple given: the prospect of [future
[scarcities]{.mark} of]{.underline} vital natural resources, including
[energy, water]{.underline}, land, [food,]{.underline} and critical
minerals. This in itself would [[guarantee social unrest, geopolitical
friction, and war]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is important to note that
absolute scarcity doesn't have to be on the horizon in any given
resource category for this scenario to kick in. A lack of adequate
supplies to meet the needs of a growing, ever more urbanized and
industrialized global population is enough. Given the wave of
extinctions that scientists are recording, some resources --- particular
species of fish, animals, and trees, for example --- will become less
abundant in the decades to come, and may even disappear altogether. But
key materials for modern civilization like oil, uranium, and copper will
simply prove harder and more costly to acquire, leading to supply
bottlenecks and periodic shortages. Oil --- the single most important
commodity in the international economy --- provides an apt example.
Although global oil supplies may actually grow in the coming decades,
many experts doubt that they can be expanded sufficiently to meet the
needs of a rising global middle class that is, for instance, expected to
buy millions of new cars in the near future. In its 2011 World Energy
Outlook, the International Energy Agency claimed that an anticipated
global oil demand of 104 million barrels per day in 2035 will be
satisfied. This, the report suggested, would be thanks in large part to
additional supplies of "unconventional oil" (Canadian tar sands, shale
oil, and so on), as well as 55 million barrels of new oil from fields
"yet to be found" and "yet to be developed." However, many analysts
scoff at this optimistic assessment, arguing that rising production
costs (for energy that will be ever more difficult and costly to
extract), environmental opposition, warfare, corruption, and other
impediments will make it extremely difficult to achieve increases of
this magnitude. In other words, even if production manages for a time to
top the 2010 level of 87 million barrels per day, the goal of 104
million barrels will never be reached and the world's major consumers
will face virtual, if not absolute, scarcity. Water provides another
potent example. On an annual basis, the supply of drinking water
provided by natural precipitation remains more or less constant: about
40,000 cubic kilometers. But much of this precipitation lands on
Greenland, Antarctica, Siberia, and inner Amazonia where there are very
few people, so the supply available to major concentrations of humanity
is often surprisingly limited. In many regions with high population
levels, water supplies are already relatively sparse. This is especially
true of North Africa, Central Asia, and the Middle East, where the
demand for water continues to grow as a result of rising populations,
urbanization, and the emergence of new water-intensive industries. The
result, even when the supply remains constant, is an environment of
increasing scarcity. Wherever you look, the picture is roughly the same:
supplies of critical resources may be rising or falling, but rarely do
they appear to be outpacing demand, producing a sense of widespread and
systemic scarcity. However generated, a perception of scarcity --- or
imminent scarcity --- regularly leads to anxiety, resentment, hostility,
and contentiousness. This pattern is very well understood, and has been
evident throughout human history. In his book Constant Battles, for
example, Steven LeBlanc, director of collections for Harvard's Peabody
Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, notes that many ancient
civilizations experienced higher levels of warfare when faced with
resource shortages brought about by population growth, crop failures, or
persistent drought. Jared Diamond, author of the bestsellerCollapse, has
detected a similar pattern in Mayan civilization and the Anasazi culture
of New Mexico's Chaco Canyon. More recently, [[concern over adequate
food]{.mark} for the home population was a [significant factor]{.mark}
in Japan's invasion of Manchuria in 1931 and [Germany's invasions of
Poland]{.mark} in 1939 and the Soviet Union in 1941]{.underline},
according to Lizzie Collingham, author of The Taste of War. Although the
global supply of most basic commodities has grown enormously since the
end of World War II, analysts see the persistence of resource-related
conflict in areas where materials remain scarce or there is anxiety
about the future reliability of supplies. Many experts believe, for
example, that the fighting in Darfur and other war-ravaged areas of
North Africa has been driven, at least in part, by competition among
desert tribes for access to scarce water supplies, exacerbated in some
cases by rising population levels. "In Darfur," says a 2009 report from
the U.N. Environment Programme on the role of natural resources in the
conflict, "recurrent drought, increasing demographic pressures, and
political marginalization are among the forces that have pushed the
region into a spiral of lawlessness and violence that has led to 300,000
deaths and the displacement of more than two million people since 2003."
Anxiety over future supplies is often also a factor in conflicts that
break out over access to oil or control of contested undersea reserves
of oil and natural gas. In 1979, for instance, when the Islamic
revolution in Iran overthrew the Shah and the Soviets invaded
Afghanistan, Washington began to fear that someday it might be denied
access to Persian Gulf oil. At that point, President Jimmy Carter
promptly announced what came to be called the Carter Doctrine. In his
1980 State of the Union Address, Carter affirmed that any move to impede
the flow of oil from the Gulf would be viewed as a threat to America's
"vital interests" and would be repelled by "any means necessary,
including military force." In 1990, this principle was invoked by
President George H.W. Bush to justify intervention in the first Persian
Gulf War, just as his son would use it, in part, to justify the 2003
invasion of Iraq. Today, it remains the basis for U.S. plans to employ
force to stop the Iranians from closing the Strait of Hormuz, the
strategic waterway connecting the Persian Gulf to the Indian Ocean
through which about 35% of the world's seaborne oil commerce passes.
Recently, [a set of [resource conflicts]{.mark} have been rising toward
the [boiling]{.mark} point [between China and its neighbors in Southeast
Asia]{.mark} when it comes to control of offshore [oil and gas reserves
in the South China Sea]{.mark}. Although the resulting naval clashes
have yet to result in a loss of life, a [strong possibility of military
escalation exists]{.mark}. A similar situation has also arisen in the
East China Sea, where China and Japan are jousting for control over
similarly valuable undersea reserves.]{.underline} Meanwhile, in the
South Atlantic Ocean, Argentina and Britain are once again squabbling
over the Falkland Islands (called Las Malvinas by the Argentinians)
because oil has been discovered in surrounding waters. By all accounts,
[resource-driven potential [conflicts like these will only multiply in
the years ahead]{.mark} as demand rises, supplies dwindle, and more of
what remains will be found in disputed areas]{.underline}. In a 2012
study titled Resources Futures, the respected British think-tank Chatham
House expressed particular concern about possible resource wars over
water, especially in areas like the Nile and Jordan River basins where
several groups or countries must share the same river for the majority
of their water supplies and few possess the wherewithal to develop
alternatives. "Against this backdrop of tight supplies and competition,
issues related to water rights, prices, and pollution are becoming
contentious," the report noted. "In areas with limited capacity to
govern shared resources, balance competing demands, and mobilize new
investments, tensions over water may erupt into more open
confrontations." Heading for a Resource-Shock World Tensions like these
would be destined to grow by themselves because in so many areas
supplies of key resources will not be able to keep up with demand. As it
happens, though, they are not "by themselves." On this planet, a second
major force has entered the equation in a significant way. With the
growing reality of climate change, everything becomes a lot more
terrifying. Normally, when we consider the impact of climate change, we
think primarily about the environment --- the melting Arctic ice cap or
Greenland ice shield, rising global sea levels, intensifying storms,
expanding deserts, and endangered or disappearing species like the polar
bear. But a growing number of experts are coming to realize that [the
most potent effects of climate change will be experienced by humans
directly through the impairment or wholesale destruction of habitats
upon which we rely for food production, industrial activities, or simply
to live.]{.underline} Essentially[, [climate change]{.mark} will wreak
its havoc on us by **[constraining our access to the basics of life:
vital resources that include food, water, land, and energy. This will be
devastating to human life, even as it significantly increases the danger
of resource conflicts of all sorts erupting]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We
already know enough about the future effects of climate change to
predict the following with reasonable confidence: \* Rising sea levels
will in the next half-century erase many coastal areas, destroying large
cities, critical infrastructure (including roads, railroads, ports,
airports, pipelines, refineries, and power plants), and prime
agricultural land. \* Diminished rainfall and prolonged droughts will
turn once-verdant croplands into dust bowls, reducing food output and
turning millions into "climate refugees." \* More severe storms and
intense heat waves will kill crops, trigger forest fires, cause floods,
and destroy critical infrastructure. No one can predict how much food,
land, water, and energy will be lost as a result of this onslaught (and
other climate-change effects that are harder to predict or even possibly
imagine), but the cumulative effect will undoubtedly be staggering. In
Resources Futures, Chatham House offers a particularly dire warning when
it comes to the threat of diminished precipitation to rain-fed
agriculture. "By 2020," the report says, "yields from rain-fed
agriculture could be reduced by up to 50%" in some areas. The highest
rates of loss are expected to be in Africa, where reliance on rain-fed
farming is greatest, but agriculture in China, India, Pakistan, and
Central Asia is also likely to be severely affected. [Heat waves,
droughts, and other effects of climate change will also reduce the flow
of many vital rivers, diminishing water supplies for irrigation,
hydro-electricity power facilities, and nuclear reactors]{.underline}
(which need massive amounts of water for cooling purposes). The melting
of glaciers, especially in the Andes in Latin America and the Himalayas
in South Asia, will also rob communities and cities of crucial water
supplies. An expected increase in the frequency of hurricanes and
typhoons will pose a growing threat to offshore oil rigs, coastal
refineries, transmission lines, and other components of the global
energy system. The melting of the Arctic ice cap will open that region
to oil and gas exploration, but an increase in iceberg activity will
make all efforts to exploit that region's energy supplies perilous and
exceedingly costly. Longer growing seasons in the north, especially
Siberia and Canada's northern provinces, might compensate to some degree
for the desiccation of croplands in more southerly latitudes. However,
moving the global agricultural system (and the world's farmers)
northward from abandoned farmlands in the United States, Mexico, Brazil,
India, China, Argentina, and Australia would be a daunting prospect. [It
is safe to assume that [climate change]{.mark}, especially when
[combined with]{.mark} growing [supply shortages,]{.mark} will result in
a significant reduction in the planet's vital resources, augmenting [the
kinds of pressures that have historically led to
conflict,]{.mark}]{.underline} even under better circumstances. In this
way, according to the Chatham House report, [climate change is [best
understood as a "threat multiplier... a key factor exacerbating existing
resource vulnerability"]{.mark}]{.underline} in states already prone to
such disorders. Like other experts on the subject, Chatham House's
analysts claim, for example, that climate change will reduce crop output
in many areas, sending global food prices soaring and triggering unrest
among those already pushed to the limit under existing conditions.
"Increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as
droughts, heat waves, and floods, will also result in much larger and
frequent local harvest shocks around the world... These shocks will
affect global food prices whenever key centers of agricultural
production area are hit --- further amplifying global food price
volatility." This, in turn, will increase the likelihood of civil
unrest. When, for instance, a brutal heat wave decimated Russia's wheat
crop during the summer of 2010, the global price of wheat (and so of
that staple of life,bread) began an inexorable upward climb, reaching
particularly high levels in North Africa and the Middle East. With local
governments unwilling or unable to help desperate populations, anger
over impossible-to-afford food merged with resentment toward autocratic
regimes to trigger the massive popular outburst we know as the Arab
Spring. Many such explosions are likely in the future, Chatham House
suggests, if current trends continue as climate change and resource
scarcity meld into a single reality in our world. A single provocative
question from that group should haunt us all: "Are we on the cusp of a
new world order dominated by struggles over access to affordable
resources?" For the U.S. intelligence community, which appears to have
been influenced by the report, the response was blunt. In March, for the
first time, Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper listed
"[competition and scarcity involving natural resources" as [a national
security threat on a par with global terrorism, cyberwar, and nuclear
proliferation]{.mark}]{.underline}. "Many countries important to the
United States are vulnerable to natural resource shocks that degrade
economic development, frustrate attempts to democratize, raise the risk
of regime-threatening instability, and aggravate regional tensions," he
wrote in his prepared statement for the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence. "[Extreme weather events (floods, droughts, heat waves)
will increasingly disrupt food and energy markets, exacerbating state
weakness]{.underline}, forcing human migrations, and triggering riots,
civil disobedience, and vandalism." There was a new phrase embedded in
his comments: "resource shocks." It catches something of the world we're
barreling toward, and the language is striking for an intelligence
community that, like the government it serves, has largely played down
or ignored the dangers of climate change. For the first time, senior
government analysts may be coming to appreciate what energy experts,
resource analysts, and scientists have long been warning about: [[the
unbridled consumption of the world's natural resources, combined with
the advent of extreme climate change, could produce a global explosion
of human chaos and conflict.]{.mark} We are now heading directly into a
resource-shock world.]{.underline}

### Warming 🡪 Extinction

#### Unmitigated warming causes extinction -- no adaptation 

**Klein 14** (Naomi, award-winning journalist, syndicated columnist,
former Miliband Fellow at the London School of Economics, member of the
board of directors of [350.org](http://350.org/), *This Changes
Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate*, 2014, pg. 12-14)

But the bigger problem---and the reason Copenhagen caused such great
despair---is that because governments did not agree to binding targets,
they are free to pretty much ignore their commitments. Which is
precisely what is happening. Indeed, emissions are rising so rapidly
that unless something radical changes within our economic structure[, 2
degrees now looks like a utopian dream.]{.underline} And it's not just
environmentalists who are raising the alarm. [The World
Bank]{.underline} also warned when it [released its report
that]{.underline} "[we're on track
to]{.underline} [a]{.underline} [4-C]{.underline} [warmer
world]{.underline} \[by century's end\] [marked
by]{.underline} **[extreme]{.underline}** [**heat
waves**,]{.underline} **[declining]{.underline}** **[global]{.underline}** [**foodstocks**,]{.underline} **[loss
of ecosystems]{.underline}** [and
biodiversity,]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[life-threatening]{.underline}** **[sea
level rise]{.underline}**." And the report cautioned that, "[there
isalso]{.underline} **[no
certainty]{.underline}** **[that]{.underline}** **[adaptation]{.underline}** **[to
a 4-C world]{.underline}** **[is possible]{.underline}**."
Kevin [Anderson,]{.underline} former director (now [deputy director) of
the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change]{.underline}, which has quickly
established itself [as one of the U.K's premier climate research
institutions, is even blunter; he says]{.underline} [4 degrees Celsius
warming]{.underline}---7.2 degrees Fahrenheit---[is "incompatible with
an organized, equitable, and civilized global
community]{.underline}."¶ We don't know exactly what a 4 degree Celsius
world would look like, but even the best-case scenario is likely to be
calamitous. [Four degrees of warming could raise global sea levels by 1
or possibly even 2 meters by 2100]{.underline} (and would lock in at
least a few additional meters over future centuries). This would drown
some island nations such as the Maldives and Tuvalu, and inundate many
coastal areas from Ecuador and Brazil to the Netherlands to much of
California and the northeastern United States as well as huge swaths of
South and Southeast Asia. Major cities likely in jeopardy include
Boston, New York, greater Los Angeles, Vancouver, London, Mumbai, Hong
Kong, and Shanghai.¶ Meanwhile, [brutal heat waves that can kill tens of
thousands of people]{.underline}, even in wealthy countries, [would
become entirely unremarkable summer events on every continent but
Antarctica]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} [heat
would]{.underline} [also]{.underline} [cause staple crops to
suffer]{.underline} **[dramatic]{.underline}** **[yield]{.underline}** [**losses**across
the globe]{.underline} (it is possible that Indian wheat and U.S. could
plummet by as much as 60 percent), this at a
time [when]{.underline} [demand will be surging]{.underline} [due to
population growth and a growing demand for meat]{.underline}. And since
crops will be facing not just heat stress but also extreme events such
as wide-ranging droughts, flooding, or pest outbreaks, the [losses could
easily turn out to be more severe than the models have
predicted]{.underline}. [When
you]{.underline} [add]{.underline} [ruinous]{.underline} [hurricanes,
raging]{.underline} [wildfires, fisheries collapses,
widespread]{.underline} [disruptions to
water]{.underline} [supplies,]{.underline} [extinctions,
and]{.underline} [globe-trotting]{.underline} [diseases]{.underline} [to
the mix, it indeed becomes difficult to imagine that a peaceful, ordered
society could be sustained]{.underline} (that is, where such a thing
exists in the first place).¶ And keep in mind that [these are the
optimistic scenarios in which warming is more or less stabilized at 4
degrees Celsius and does not trigger tipping points beyond
which]{.underline} **[runaway warming]{.underline}** [would
occur]{.underline}. Based on the latest modeling, it is becoming safer
to assume that [4]{.underline} [degrees]{.underline} [could bring
about]{.underline} [a number of extremely
dangerous]{.underline} [feedback loops]{.underline}---an Arctic that is
regularly ice-free in September, for instance, or, according to one
recent study, [global vegetation that is too saturated to act as a
reliable "sink]{.underline}", leading to more carbon being emitted
rather than stored. [Once this happens, any hope of predicting impacts
pretty much goes out the window]{.underline}. And this process may be
starting sooner than anyone predicted. In May 2014, [NASA
and]{.underline} the **[U]{.underline}**niversity
of **[C]{.underline}**alifornia, [Irvine scientists
revealed]{.underline} that [glacier melt]{.underline} in a section of
West Antarctica roughly the size of France now "[appears
unstoppable]{.underline}." This likely spells down for the entire West
Antarctic ice sheet, which according to lead study author Eric Rignot
"comes with a sea level rise between three and five metres. Such an
event will displace millions of people worldwide." [The disintegration,
however, could unfold over centuries and there is]{.underline} **[still
time for emission reductions to slow down the process and prevent the
worst]{.underline}**. ¶ Much more frightening than any of this is the
fact that [plenty of mainstream analysts think that]{.underline} on our
current emissions trajectory, [we are headed for]{.underline} **[even
more than 4 degrees]{.underline}** [of warming]{.underline}. In
2011, [the usually staid International Energy
Agency]{.underline} (IEA) [issued a report predicting
that]{.underline} [we are actually on track for]{.underline} [6
degrees]{.underline} [Celsius]{.underline}---10.8 degrees
Fahrenheit---of warming. And as the IEA's chief economist put it:
"Everybody, even the school children, knows
that [this]{.underline} [will have catastrophic
implications]{.underline} [for all of us]{.underline}." (The evidence
indicates that [6 degrees]{.underline} [of warming is likely
to]{.underline} [set in motion]{.underline} [several]{.underline} [major
tipping points]{.underline}---not only slower ones such as the
aforementioned breakdown of the West Antarctic ice sheet, but possibly
more abrupt
ones, [like]{.underline} **[massive]{.underline}** **[releases]{.underline}** **[of
methane]{.underline}** [from]{.underline} [Arctic]{.underline} [permafrost]{.underline}.)
The accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers as also published a report
warning businesses that we are headed for "4-C , or even 6-C" of
warming.¶ These various projections are the equivalent of every alarm in
your house going off simultaneously. And then every alarm on your street
going off as well, one by one by one. They mean, quite simply,
that [climate change has become an]{.underline} **[existential
crisis]{.underline}** **[for the human species]{.underline}**. The only
historical precedent for a crisis of this depth and scale was the Cold
War fear that we were headed toward nuclear holocaust, which would have
made much of the planet uninhabitable. But that was (and remains) a
threat; a slim possibility, should geopolitics spiral out of
control. [The vast majority of nuclear scientists never told us that we
were almost certainly going to put our civilization in peril if we kept
going about our daily lives as usual, doing exactly what we were already
going, which is what climate scientists have been telling us for
years]{.underline}. ¶ As the Ohio State University climatologist Lonnie
G. Thompson, a world-renowned specialist on glacier melt, explained in
2010, "[Climatologists]{.underline}, like other scientists, [tend to be
a stolid group. We]{.underline} [are not given to theatrical
rantings]{.underline} about falling skies. Most of us are far more
comfortable in our laboratories or gathering data in the field than we
are giving interviews to journalists or speaking before Congressional
committees. [When then are climatologists speaking out about the dangers
of global warming?]{.underline} The answer is that virtually **[all of
us]{.underline}** [are]{.underline} [now]{.underline} [convinced
thatglobal]{.underline} [warming poses a]{.underline} **[clear and
present]{.underline}** **[danger to civilization]{.underline}**."

government [debt]{.mark}]{.underline}. Former treasury secretary Henry
M. Paulson and others have suggested that the [structural imbalances

current [economic crisis]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Yet, China will almost
certainly be called on to purchase the lion\'s share of new U.S. debt
instruments issued in connection with the US. stimulus and recovery
package. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton\'s February 23, 2009,
reassur-ance to Beijing that U.S. markets remain safe and her call for
continued Chinese investment in the U.S. bond market as a means to help
both countries, and the world, emerge from global recession underscored
the shared interest---and central role---that both countries have in
turning around the global economy quickly. Although [China\'s
considerable holdings of U.S. debt have been]{.underline} seen as **[a
troubling problem]{.underline}**, [they are now being perceived

[a]{.underline} primary [**[responsibility]{.underline}** [to

**[cooperation has been elusive]{.underline}**, [owing]{.underline} as
much **[to Washington\'s reluctance]{.underline}** as to Beijing\'s
intransigence. Painting China as the environmental bogeyman as an excuse
for foot-dragging in policymaking is no longer an option; for its part,
China, as the world\'s top polluter, must cease playing the
developing-economy card. Yet [energy security and climate
change]{.underline} **[remain an area of]{.underline}** genuine
**[opportunity]{.underline}** for joint achievement. Indeed, U.S.-China

The global future is likely to be increasingly volatile and uncertain.
The rate of change is increasing, driven by the accelerating pace of
technological development, unprecedented urbanization and growth of the
global middle class, and a wide range of [challenges beyond the control
of any one country but potentially affecting the **prosperity and
security** of all countries. Disruptive change in one geographic or
functional area will spread quickly]{.underline}.. No country, and
certainly not those with the largest populations and largest economies,
will be immune. [Global challenges like **climate change**, food and
water shortages, and **resource scarcities** will shape the strategic
context for all nations]{.underline} and require reconsideration of
traditional national concerns such as sovereignty and maximizing the
ability of national leaders to control their country's destiny. [What
China and the United States do, individually and together, will have a
major impact on the future of the global system]{.underline}. As
importantly, our individual fates will be inextricably linked to how
that future plays out. The three illustrative scenarios sketched out
below underscore how critical the future of the US-China relationship is
to each country and to the world. • Global Drift and Erosion (the
present world trajectory): [In a world in which nations **fail to
resolve global problems** and strengthen mechanisms of global
cooperation, **governments gradually turn inward**.]{.underline} Each
nation seeks to protect and advance its own narrow national interests or
to preserve an unsustainable status quo that is rapidly changing in ways
that erode the international order. [The international community's lack
of ability to cooperate to meet global challenges leads to international
crises and instability.]{.underline} Zero-Sum World: Unsustainable drift
leads to a world of predominantly zero-sum competition and conflict in
the face of severe resource constraints. [The result is economic crises
and internal instability as well as interstate confrontation. There is
risk of military conflict between major powers, which increases **global
mistrust and uncertainty** and fosters an "each nation for itself"
mentality that further **undermines** the ability of states to cooperate
in the face of growing common challenges]{.underline}. • Global
Revitalization and Cooperation: To escape the perils of drift or
zero-sum competition, [leaders in countries with the most to lose work
together to manage and take advantage of global challenges and
megatrends. Cooperation makes it possible to achieve win-win outcomes
that avoid or mitigate negative consequences of increased demand for
resources and the **impact of climate change** as well as to harness new
technologies to improve living conditions through sustainable
development. Cooperation creates and utilizes new transnational
institutions to prevent conflict and enhance security for all. **China
and the United States** become more prosperous as we work
together]{.underline}. 6 ATLANTIC COUNCIL China-US Cooperation: Key to
the Global Future The possible futures sketched out above (and developed
at greater length below) are intended to stimulate thinking about how
current trends and uncertainties could lead to very different global and
national outcomes. For many reasons, [the United States and China will
have **greater ability and incentives than other countries** to
cooperate in determining and shaping developments over the next two
decades.]{.underline} Indeed, it is very difficult to imagine a pathway
to "global revitalization and cooperation" in which China and the United
States do not cooperate and provide critical international leadership.
[Many factors will shape the future, some of which are beyond the
control of any nation state, but China and the United States---and the
character of the **US-China relationship**---will be
critical]{.underline}. The mutual dependence on each other's economic
performance and the success of the global economy as a whole was
demonstrated during the 2008 financial crisis that began in the United
States but quickly spread around the world. [US and Chinese leaders
recognized that they were in the "**same boat**" strategically and
engaged in a closely coordinated response to the crisis, which played a
key---if not decisive---role in preventing the situation from becoming
much worse.]{.underline} The need for joint and coordinated responses to
economic crises and to mounting economic challenges and threats is
certain to increase as globalization continues and interdependence
deepens.

insights from the maritime environment for the space domain, this
article surveys how China: 1) applies force, 2) manipulates laws, 3)
shapes the environment, 4) cooperates internationally, and 5) conducts
diplomacy. First, China possesses three major maritime agencies that
apply force in order to protect and pursue its interests: the People's
Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), People's Armed Police (PAP) and the
Maritime Law Enforcement Forces that include the Coast Guard, and the
Maritime Militia. As Andrew Erickson notes, each agency represents the
largest of its kind globally. The PLAN commands over 300 ships (whereas
U.S. Navy has 277 as of 2017) and its Coast Guard has over 1,200 ships.
In their research on territorial disputes in the South China Sea,
scholars Christopher Yung and Patrick McNulty find that China utilized
its military and paramilitary forces 148 times from 1995 to 2013 -- more
than all other active claimants (Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei,
and Taiwan) combined in the same period. Their research concluded that
as China's capabilities increased, Beijing was more likely to use force
to advance its interests and less likely to defer to legal or
multilateral solutions. From a space perspective, U.S. policymakers can
surmise that if China had a comparable offensive capability in the space
domain, it might also prefer utilizing force to challenge rivals over
other means. Though China currently does not have an offensive space
capability on par with the scale of its maritime forces, the U.S.
Department of Defense 2017 Annual Report to Congress asserted that the
[[PLA is]{.mark} aggressively [acquiring]{.mark} a range of
[counterspace capabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline} Given the fact that
there are no international limitations on developing ground-based
counterspace weapons, China may pursue an equivalent path of developing
a high quantity of systems to overwhelm adversaries during conflict.
Second, China could reinterpret laws as a pretext to apply force. In the
maritime domain, China reinterprets the United Nations Convention on the
Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to challenge U.S. freedom of navigation patrols
through the South China Sea. China claims waters extending past 12
nautical miles and into the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), saying that
foreign states must refrain from threatening the "territorial integrity
or political independence" of the owning state. Concurrently, in 1992,
China promulgated domestic maritime laws that extended its sovereign
claims and deemed the commercial or research activities of other states
illegal in contested waters. [The international community at large does
not recognize this reimagining of the EEZ; however, it does provide
China some legal footing and domestic cover to deploy maritime forces in
this region.]{.underline} Similarly, the Central Military Commission is
exploring the legalities for the use of force in space. PLA doctrine
proclaims the need to destroy, damage, or disrupt an adversary's space
capability to secure victory in the information space. Nationally, China
codified its security strategy of active defense -- using defensive
counterattacks in order to spoil the offensive actions of an adversary
-- in its National Security Law of 2015. By watching the evolution of
China's space-related domestic laws or reinterpretations of
international laws, U.S. policymakers may find China strategically
telegraphing its intentions through legal maneuvering. Third, when China
feels international laws are unfavorable, it may create an alternate
framework that advances its own interests. Shortly after a tribunal at
the Permanent Court of Arbitration of The Hague ruled against China's
activities in the South China Sea in 2016, China announced that it would
create a "maritime judicial center" and a "maritime arbitration center"
to promote its own vision for maritime law. China claimed that this
endeavor would advance the nation's role as a maritime power and support
the development of its Belt Road Initiative. Skeptics assert that China
initiated this endeavor to harden its claims on disputed territories and
to divert cases away from UNCLOS courts. By doing so, China can create
legal precedents to interpret international maritime laws and begin to
undermine the international maritime system framed around UNCLOS. In the
space arena, China is not anywhere close to rearranging an entire
judicial system around its views; however, it actively participates in
international space organizations and introduces measures that could
limit the ability for the United States to project force. Through the
United Nations, China and Russia have twice (2008 and 2014) proposed the
legally binding Treaty of Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in
Outer Space and of the Threat or Use of Force Against Outer Space
Objects (PPWT). The primary U.S. objections to the treaty were that it
did not include verification mechanisms, only applied to space-based
weapons, and did not include ground based ASAT weapons -- a primary
counterspace capability China is advancing. Fourth, [policymakers could
also examine China's maritime cooperation initiatives to envision
potential space cooperation. [China's counterpiracy operation]{.mark} in
the Gulf of Aden has slowly emerged as a valuable mechanism [to
improve]{.mark} [U.S.-China cooperation]{.mark} as seen through the
counterpiracy exercises of December 2014]{.underline}. On a grander
scale in June 2017, [China laid out an ambitious vision for cooperation
in relation to the "Maritime Silk Road" as part of its larger Belt and
Road Initiative]{.underline}. [[This plan envisions]{.mark} the
establishment of cooperative principles, environmental norms, maritime
security, and "[collaborative governance]{.mark}" to achieve mutual
prosperity]{.underline}. [If one believes in [China]{.mark}'s sincerity,
[working cooperatively]{.mark} across these lines could **[greatly
reduce security tensions]{.mark} and set conditions for long-term mutual
gain.**]{.underline} [Subsequently, China is pursuing international
cooperation in space -- not only for security and economic reasons, but
also to bolster the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party to
domestic and international audiences]{.underline}. The [European Space
Administration [(ESA)]{.mark} has [already expressed desires to
cooperate]{.mark} with China [on human space flight]{.mark} and the use
of its future space station]{.underline}. China especially values its
relationship with ESA due to the opportunities to trade and transfer
technologies denied by the United States. China and Russia have also
agreed to cooperate on human space flight and deep space exploration.
Though these initiatives are not on the scale of a Maritime Silk Road,
[they do [offer U.S. policymakers]{.mark} opportunities to work with a
rising space power for [positive ends]{.mark}]{.underline}. Finally, the
United States should pay attention to China's diplomatic and engagement
efforts with other nations. Contrary to the cooperative tenets for a
Maritime Silk Road, in 2016, China convinced Cambodia to block an
Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) joint statement that
recognized The Hague's arbitration ruling on the South China Sea dispute
in favor of the Philippines. In June 2017, Vietnam resisted China's
demands to vacate an oil venture within its EEZ, but eventually
capitulated when China threatened to use force. The most concerning
aspect for Vietnam was an atypical silence from its neighbors --
particularly from the Philippines, Indonesia, and Singapore. Apparently,
China's political and economic leverage over these nations prevented
them from publicly sympathizing with Vietnam or rebuking China's
actions. Seemingly, when pressed, China uses soft and hard power tactics
bilaterally to dislodge multilateral initiatives that counter it
interests. Could China disrupt the U.S.-European alliance as it did with
ASEAN unity? At this stage, Chinese-European cooperation in space seems
well intentioned. Nevertheless, U.S. policymakers should consider
whether China's growing space relations with Europe, Russia, or any
other space power could complicate U.S. interests in other areas. As
China strengthens its partnerships, its ability to shape laws,
institutions and the strategic preferences of others increase as well.
Conclusion [The United States sits at an important period to develop a
comprehensive space strategy that addresses China's growing influence.
U.S. cooperation with the Soviets in space during the Cold War was not
due to a desire for true cooperation, but a means to manage a potential
crisis related to the management of ballistic missiles and nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. [The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates could
[develop a similar mechanism]{.mark} for limited engagement with China
[to]{.mark} send positive signals and [reduce
misperceptions]{.mark}.]{.underline} [China's activities in space have
already intersected with U.S. interests and will only increase in
frequency and intensity over time]{.underline}. In the end, for the
United States to compete and lead in the space domain, [[it must
engage]{.mark} new players and shape the contours of the game. If
Washington is worried about how [China]{.mark} will play the game, it
can always look in the maritime arena for strategic clues.]{.underline}

[[The]{.mark} health [threat posed by migration]{.mark} has]{.underline}
recently **[[reared its head in China]{.underline}]{.mark}**. An
[outbreak of [yellow fever]{.mark}]{.underline} [that began in
Angola]{.underline} in December 2015 **[[spread to
China]{.underline}]{.mark}** three months later, marking the first case
of yellow fever ever reported in all of Asia, followed by 10 more
Chinese cases imported from Angola by May. [[Yellow fever is]{.mark}
a]{.underline} sometimes **[[deadly]{.mark} disease]{.underline}**
[caused by]{.underline} a **[mosquito-borne virus]{.underline}**. While
no cure exists, [there is [a vaccine]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} but
[it [is]{.mark}]{.underline} generally [[administered]{.underline}
**[only to those]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[living
[in]{.mark}]{.underline}** or traveling [to [areas where the disease
is]{.mark} endemic]{.underline}. As such, [[China]{.mark}'s]{.underline}
1.4 billion [citizens [are]{.mark}]{.underline} almost **[[universally
unvaccinated]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The Chinese cases came from Chinese
workers returning home after having worked in Angola, where over 200,000
Chinese workers are employed on work visas for China's aid and
investment projects in the country.46 Chinese authorities do require
travelers to Angola to be vaccinated for yellow fever, but there are
fears that many of the Chinese workers there may not have abided by this
rule. [[The spread]{.mark} of yellow fever to China
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} particularly [**[worrisome]{.underline}**
[given the]{.underline}]{.mark} [region's]{.underline} massive
[[population]{.underline}]{.mark} and the fact that
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} primary **[[vector of
transmission]{.underline}]{.mark}**--- the Aedes aegypti mosquito---[[is
**common** across]{.underline}]{.mark} much of [[China]{.mark} and
nearby countries]{.underline} in South and Southeast Asia. Many
epidemiologists have voiced concerns about how dangerous this confluence
of factors could prove to be. So far, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and China have]{.underline}]{.mark} each
[[responded to]{.underline}]{.mark} Angola's [[yellow
fever]{.underline}]{.mark} epidemic
**[[separately]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In addition to increasing
domestic mosquito monitoring and control activities to boost its own
preparedness, [the Chinese government provided Angola with]{.underline}
half a million dollars in [emergency assistance]{.underline} in
February, before the outbreak had even spread to China.47 [The
CDC]{.underline}'s Mozambique Field Epidemiology Training Program
[graduates]{.underline} have [collaborated with Angola]{.underline}'s
Ministry of Health [to track down]{.underline} suspected [cases of
yellow fever]{.underline} and intervene accordingly.48 With so much
recent discussion between U.S. and Chinese health authorities regarding
cooperative health security efforts in Africa,
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} tragic yellow fever [[outbreak
offers]{.underline}]{.mark} the two [countries]{.underline} [**[an
opportunity]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}]{.mark}
[achieve]{.underline} significant [[collab]{.mark}orative
action]{.underline} on global health, if they choose to embrace it. The
recent [concerns]{.underline} of yellow fever epidemic also [brought
attention to]{.underline} China's **[vaccine production]{.underline}**.
[The]{.underline} global [vaccine industry has]{.underline} **[long
been]{.underline}** **[dominated by]{.underline}** a few [multinational
companies]{.underline}. In the past decade[, [vaccine manufacturers from
China]{.underline}]{.mark}, India, and other emerging economies
**[[entered the]{.mark} international [market]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} helped to **[[drive down]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
[[vaccine price]{.underline}]{.mark}. For Jiankang Zhang, representative
for PATH's China Programs, [the growth of China's vaccine industry
is]{.underline} "**[a very positive development]{.underline}** for
global health, as [[governments]{.underline}]{.mark} and international
procurement agencies [will be able to [afford]{.mark}]{.underline} more
**[life-saving [vaccines]{.mark}]{.underline}** and thus protect more
lives." A Chinese vaccine manufacturer obtained the first WHO
prequalification vaccine (the Japanese encephalitis vaccine) in October
2013.49 Hope has been high that other vaccines manufactured from China
will be qualified and enter the global market before the next pandemic.
In the wake of the yellow fever epidemic in 2016, China's Sinovac
Biotech pledged to provide sufficient yellow fever vaccine supply for
all Chinese expatriate workers.50 As the world is wondering what the
next global pandemic will be, [[China's]{.mark} vaccine [manufacturing
capacity]{.mark} may]{.underline} soon [[be]{.underline}]{.mark}come
[**[one of the keys]{.underline}** [to stemming]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[a potential [global crisis]{.mark}.]{.underline}** A final global
health threat for the United States and China to consider as an area for
greater cooperation is bioterrorism. Bilateral cooperation on
counterterrorism is long established, but [[there is **little evidence**
of collab]{.underline}]{.mark}oration **[[in]{.mark} combating
[bioterror]{.mark}ism]{.underline}**. Microsoft founder Bill Gates
recently brought this issue into sharp relief at the Munich Security
Conference that was attended by 450 senior decision makers from around
the globe. Gates warned that "whether it occurs by a quirk of nature or
at the hand of a terrorist, [a]{.underline} fast-moving [[airborne
pathogen]{.mark} could [kill]{.mark}]{.underline} more than **[[30
million]{.underline}]{.mark}** people **[[in less than a
year]{.underline}]{.mark}**."51 Among other recommendations, [he
advocated]{.underline} that [[countries need to prepare for
pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark} in the same manner that the military
prepares for war---[[with]{.mark} "germ games" and]{.underline} other
**[pandemic [exercises]{.mark}]{.underline}**. He concluded that
bioterrorism now ranks with nuclear war and climate

change as one of three existential threats to humankind.

[The related parties should propel the cooperation in African
pragmatically and gradually. At the first stage, cooperation and
coordination can be carried out in light of projects and specific
problems]{.underline}. Priority should be given to the following fields:
([1) Field of environment which includes food crisis, natural disasters,
climate changes and water resources]{.underline}. Non-traditional issues
in the field of Environment not only diminish what Africa has achieved
in economic development, but also constitute potential roots of
political conflicts. For instance, the Darfur Crisis is directly due to
the contending for water and soil resources by related parties.55 ([2)
Field of energy. It serves the common interests of every party to ensure
the rational development and effective supply of energy and to prevent
the unreason able rising of energy price which breaks with the balance
between supply and demand]{.underline}. [(3) Field of infrastructure.
Backwardness in infrastructure is the bottle neck restricting Africa\'s
economic development; therefore, the AU and the NEPAD place this field
at top priority. Western countries\' capital and project management
experience and China\'s engineering technology of low price and high
quality can complement each other and promote Africa\'s infrastructure
construc tion]{.underline}. [(4) Field of peace and security. These are
prerequisites for development]{.underline}. Therefore it is in the
interest of Africa, the EU and China to cooperate in order to promote
stability and prosperity in African countries and to work together to
assist with AU peace-keeping operations, capacity building and training.
[(5) Field of education and public health. China has gained abundant
experience in medical and educational aid work]{.underline};56 while
various Western charity institutions, churches and social groups have
been engaging in primary education and public health work at the grass
roots of African countries[. China and Western countries can strengthen
cooperation in respect of human resources development and combating
diseases such as malaria]{.underline}, Aids and tuberculosis. After
gaining experience and mutual trust in the above fields, the parties
concerned can carry out cooperation in political fields such as
governance of Africa, political ideas and development models and so on[.
Through consultation and coordination, they can reduce suspicion and
enmity between each other and enhance mutual trust and
understanding.]{.underline} Anyhow, the fundamental way out for Africa
is to find a development model of its own and a path to build
self-esteem and dignity internally.

the United Nations as a neutral party between the United States and
China. The Chinese seem willing to support United Nations initiatives in
Africa as shown through its participation in UN peacekeeping missions
and its support to NEPAD]{.underline} (which the United Nations
supports). [In fact, because China seems to understand the importance of
support to NEPAD to further their interests in Africa, the United States
should look for ways to support African development more through NEPAD

Chinese President Xi [Jinping has backed efforts to ease tensions in the
Korean peninsula]{.underline}, but also said that North Korea\'s
security concerns should be addressed. In his widely watched meeting
with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang yesterday, President
[Xi also made it clear that China intended to be part of the equation in
resolving issues in the peninsula. Both countries have had run-ins with
the United States this year - China over trade and North Korea over
stalled denuclearisation talks]{.underline}. Mr [Xi\'s visit to
Pyongyang]{.underline} - before he meets US President Donald Trump at
the Group of 20 Summit in Japan next week - [served to underline
Beijing\'s close ties with North Korea]{.underline}, observers said. [Mr
Xi]{.underline} told Mr Kim that [he hopes the issue of denuclearising
the peninsula will be resolved through dialogue and that Beijing wants
to play a constructive role in the process. At the same time, he said,
any resolution should help North Korea meet its \"reasonable security
and development concerns\", indicating that Beijing wants the US to
accept North Korean demands for a security guarantee while easing
economic sanctions]{.underline}. Mr Kim said North Korea had \"taken
multiple positive steps\" over the past year to reduce tensions on the
peninsula, but this \"had not elicited a positive response from relevant
parties\". Talks between [Mr Trump and Mr Kim started promisingly in
Singapore last year but ended in mutual recriminations the last time the
two men met in Hanoi to discuss the mechanics of North Korea giving up
its nuclear arsenal in exchange for security guarantees and an end to
crippling economic sanctions]{.underline}. As Mr Xi arrived to a 21-gun
salute, with 250,000 North Koreans lining the streets, observers said
there would have to be intense discussions behind the ebullient optics
to break the deadlocked nuclear talks. Renmin University\'s North Korea
expert [Cheng Xiaohe said Mr Xi and Mr Kim would likely work to reach a
joint position on a provisional deal, which could then be presented to
Mr Trump in Japan. \"Whatever Xi brings to Trump at the G-20, it would
not just be North Korea\'s position, but would also include China\'s
input.\"]{.underline} South Korean [experts were more sceptical of any
breakthrough,]{.underline} with Dr Lee Seong-hyon of the Sejong
Institute think-tank noting that [the visit could be seen as a
diversionary tactic and leverage in the lead-up to Mr Xi\'s meeting with

as the most pressing challenge in the region, and noted that there is a
mutual interest in a denuclearized Korean Peninsula]{.underline}. Some
participants claimed that the United States and China should at least
conduct joint contingency planning, [as the threat of military clashes
has grown in the past year]{.underline}. However, [some participants
argued that the best avenue to sustain pressure on North Korea would be
through U.S.-Chinese cooperation. That could result in the start of a
denuclearization process and a ban on long-range missile testing,

However, significant challenges to such a process remain, including the
verification and longevity of an international commitment in light of
recent U.S. reversals on the Paris climate accords and the Iran nuclear

[this]{.underline} security [dilemma]{.underline} could grow more
pronounced, causing each side to nationalize innovation streams and
limit transparency in order to seek an edge over the other. In other
words, an existing security dilemma [could quickly morph into an AI
nightmare.]{.underline} The stakes are high. As others have pointed out,
[the United States and China stand on the cusp of rapid change in the
conduct of war]{.underline}, not unlike the employment of cavalry, the
advent of the rifled musket, or the merging of fast armor with air
support to achieve a blitzkreig.\[5\] [Both countries are investing
heavily to merge AI-enhanced capabilities]{.underline} and enable
machine-based decision processes with minimal human interaction. [In the
event of a confrontation]{.underline} between U.S. and Chinese forces
(e.g., in the South China Sea), robotics and [AI could play a critical
role. Rapid escalation is an acute risk]{.underline}, particularly if
the pace of technological advancements in capabilities exceeds the
development of protocols for maintaining human agency in decision-making
loops. [The real possibility of unintended and rapid escalation should
provide incentive for both sides to begin developing boundaries around
uses of AI in warfighting]{.underline}. The normative development
process around previous arms control treaties, including the Chemical
Weapons Convention, could offer applicable lessons that the United
States and China could draw from.

[The 1970s was a period for foreign policy in which some very important
stars came into alignment, culminating in Sino-U.S. "normalization" 40
years ago.]{.underline} An improbable coincidence of perceptive
leadership in both countries---by Richard Nixon and Mao Zedong---saw the
opportunities of realignment. [Each built the domestic coalition
necessary to create a remarkably durable, four-decade-long period of
peace, stability, and growing prosperity for both countries, Asia, and
the world]{.underline}. In the [United States]{.underline}, eight
administrations (Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush, and
Obama) [maintained basic policy continuity]{.underline}, while four did
so in China (Mao, Deng, Jiang, and Hu). The underlying dynamic of this
protracted improvement was that [each country's leadership came to see
that the other country could be useful in addressing domestic and
international challenges of utmost concern to itself.]{.underline} [It
was a very simple calculus---cooperation was more beneficial than
contention. Initially, both nations enhanced security cooperation with
respect to a common foe, the Soviet Union. This allowed the United
States and the PRC to avoid further entrapment in wars on China's
periphery.]{.underline} Economically, [China gained capital, technology,
and markets, and the United States gained gradually enlarging access to
a rapidly growing market.]{.underline} Culturally and intellectually,
[the United States tapped into new sources of brainpower, and China made
up time for a generation intellectually impoverished by the Cultural
Revolution. The progress China made is astounding, and the United States
now has growing interests in aligning itself with mounting Chinese
intellectual capacity.]{.underline} Scholars Qingnan Xie and Richard
Freeman find that "in 2016, 20 percent of the authors \[in Science and
Nature, premier scientific journals\] were Chinese---more than twice the
share in 2000."1 [The next era's gains in artificial intelligence will
go to the countries with big data---China has big data.2 I do not
attribute gains in each of these areas exclusively to engagement, but
without those policies, these important advances would have taken much
longer to achieve.]{.underline} Small examples can reveal big things.

Michael D. **Swaine**, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace and one of the most prominent American analysts in
Chinese security studies **2015** Beyond American Predominance in the
Western Pacific: The Need for a Stable U.S.-China Balance of Power
https://carnegieendowment.org/2015/04/20/beyond-american-predominance-in-western-pacific-need-for-stable-u.s.-china-balance-of-power-pub-59837

[The core assumptions underlying this negative dynamic
juxtapose]{.underline}, on the one side, the post--World War II American
notion that long-term order and prosperity depend on the unique
leadership role and dominant military power of the United States as a
security guarantor, dispute arbiter, deterrent force, supporter of
international law, and provider of public goods for states located in
critical regions of the world, including the maritime Asia-Pacific.
Indeed, for virtually all U.S. officials and many Asian leaders,
American military predominance, meaning the clear ability to defeat any
potential military challenge to U.S. and allied interests anywhere along
the Asian littoral and across the Western Pacific, from the continental
United States to the Indian Ocean, has provided the foundation for a
seventy-year-long period of relative peace and economic growth
throughout most of the region. In this view, U.S. maritime primacy has
forestalled arms races and armed disputes over long-standing rivalries
and permitted a sustained focus on peaceful economic development.¶ On
the other side, the Chinese espouse the belief that order and
prosperity, especially in an increasingly multipolar and interdependent
world, should rely on a largely benign and roughly equal balance of
power between the major nations, rooted in the need to cooperate to
manage an arguably increasing number of common challenges and mediated,
whenever possible, through international institutions such as the United
Nations. In this more broadly dispersed yet hierarchical power
structure, stronger powers have a duty both to guide and shape smaller
powers in mutually beneficial directions, not to dominate and manipulate
them. In this world, no single power should have the ability or the
intention to keep other powers in a condition of military or political
subservience, and no power should seriously infringe on the sovereignty
of another power without the endorsement of the international
community.¶ To some extent, these [U.S. and Chinese]{.underline} views
are [self-serving]{.underline}. While taking on many burdens across the
globe in defending public goods such as sea lines of communication and
enduring persistent trade deficits in order to stimulate global
development, Washington nonetheless benefits enormously from a U.S.-led
international order in which its views and preferences are given special
consideration. Its military power and economic clout ensure a privileged
position in major finance, trade, and security-oriented regimes, meaning
that the makeup, purpose, and rules of those regimes largely reflect its
power and interests, operate in ways that affirm U.S. views on the most
critical issues, and cannot be changed in major ways without
Washington's approval. Conversely, the Chinese seem to believe that a
genuine balance-of-power system and a strengthened process of
rules-based, international decisionmaking---meaning that no single power
has the clear unilateral ability to compel others to accept its rules
and procedures---will benefit China by giving it a greater voice among
nations and serving to restrain a supposedly arrogant, unilateralist,
and at times threatening the United States.¶ Aside from such obvious
self-interest, however, [policy communities in both nations genuinely
believe that their preferred international distribution of power best
reflects the current and future reality of the international
system]{.underline}: For most Americans, despite the forces of
globalization, which are creating ever more dispersed and interdependent
levels of economic, political, social, and military power among nations,
peace and stability only results from the unique ability of a single,
relatively benign superpower to shape, lead, and deter major threats to
global peace and prosperity. For the Chinese, all major industrialized
powers seek to control the international order in ways that can and at
times do weaken or threaten lesser (and especially developing) powers
and to varying degrees diminish the overall stability and prosperity of
the system. However, in light of the steady diffusion of power occurring
across the international system, many Chinese also believe that even the
most powerful states will need to overcome their drive for dominance and
cooperate in unprecedented ways.¶ Despite such stark differences, these
views coexisted more or less peacefully for many decades after World War
II, primarily because Beijing had neither the capacity nor the desire to
alter the U.S.-dominated order, both globally and in maritime Asia. From
the 1950s through the late 1970s, China was wracked by economically and
socially destructive Maoist ideological campaigns and internecine
political struggles, and it was threatened by the Soviet Union, its
huge, better-armed continental neighbor to the north. Such problems not
only distracted China's leaders for decades but also eventually
compelled them to embark on an unprecedented overture to the West, both
to counter the Soviet Union and to facilitate the kind of market-driven
economic development strategy that was needed to reestablish China as a
major regional and possibly global power. In fact, under such
conditions, many Chinese viewed American predominance in maritime Asia
and the U.S.-led alliance system that sustained it as on balance
beneficial to China. It kept the Soviets largely out of the region, kept
Japan nonmilitarized and oriented toward peace, and allowed Beijing's
Asian neighbors to concentrate on outward-oriented, beneficial economic
growth instead of disruptive arms races or historical rivalries.
Washington was only too happy to oblige Beijing in sustaining such an
order.¶ All this is now changing, at least in Asia. China's overseas
trade- and investment-driven economic success, the collapse of the
Soviet Union and other Communist regimes, and the fear---intensified by
the massive Tiananmen demonstrations and bloody crackdown of 1989 as
well as the more recent color revolutions---that the Chinese regime
could be the next to fall, have vastly increased China's dependence on
and influence over external economic, political, and social forces
across Asia and beyond, while deepening its sense of vulnerability and
suspicion toward the United States. Prior to the reform era, China's
wealth and power derived largely from domestic sources, many located far
from its coastline, and its security relied, by necessity, on a largely
peasant-based but massive army and only rudimentary air and naval
forces. These factors, along with its acquisition of a small nuclear
weapons arsenal in the 1960s, made it possible for [Beijing]{.underline}
to rely on a [security strategy of nuclear deterrence]{.underline}
through a modest second-strike capability and attrition through a
protracted conventional defense centered on "luring the enemy in
deep."1¶ This strategy [can no longer provide adequate security for
China]{.underline}. [Beijing must now defend against threats before they
can reach the Chinese homeland and vital coastal economic
centers]{.underline}. For the first time in its history, Beijing now has
both the ability and the motivation to seek to diminish significantly if
not eliminate the potential threat to its domestic and growing regional
economic interests posed by America's long-standing predominance in the
Western Pacific. Indeed, its ongoing acquisition of military
capabilities designed in large part to counter or complicate U.S. and
allied air, naval, missile, space, and cyber operations along its
maritime periphery, as well as its increasing economic and
political-diplomatic initiatives across the Asian littoral and its call
for a new, post--Cold War cooperative security architecture for the
Asia-Pacific, partly serve such ends. Moreover, the desire to reduce
America's past maritime superiority and economic power has become more
achievable and hence more compelling to many Chinese as a result not
only of China's continued economic success but also of the troubles now
plaguing America and the West, from anemic economic growth and domestic
political dysfunction to image concerns resulting from arguably unjust
Middle East wars and apparent egregious human rights abuses.¶ [This
should not be surprising to anyone who understands]{.underline} modern
[Chinese]{.underline} history and great power transitions. [Beijing has
an ongoing and likely long-term and deep incentive to work with the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and the West [to sustain
continued, mutually beneficial economic growth and to address a growing
array of common global and regional concerns]{.underline}, from
pandemics to climate change and terrorism. [At the same time, it
understandably wishes to reduce its vulnerability to potential future
threats from the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and other
politically and militarily strong nations, while [increasing its overall
influence]{.underline} along its strategically important maritime
periphery. [As Beijing's]{.underline} overseas [power]{.underline} and
influence [grow]{.underline}, [its foreign interests expand, and its
domestic nationalist backers become more assertive, it will naturally
become less willing to accept]{.underline} or acquiesce in
[international]{.underline} political and economic
[relationships]{.underline}, norms, and power structures [that it
believes disproportionately and unjustly favor Western
powers]{.underline}; put China at a strategic, political, or economic
disadvantage; or generally fail to reflect movement toward a more
multipolar global and regional power structure[. It will also likely
become more fearful that a declining]{.underline} (in relative terms)
[Washington will regard an increasingly influential China as a threat to
be countered through ever more forceful or deliberate
measures]{.underline}. Indeed, [this view is already widespread among
many Chinese observers.]{.underline}¶ [**One does not need to cast
Beijing as an evil or predatory entity to understand the forces driving
such beliefs.** They stem from national self-interest, historical
insecurity]{.underline} (and nationalist pride), [suspicion, fear, and
uncertainty]{.underline}. To some degree, they also stem from a level of
opportunism, [driven in part by fear]{.underline}, [but also in part by
the understandable desire to take advantage of China's growing regional
and global influence and America's apparent relative
decline]{.underline} in order to strengthen Chinese leverage in possible
future disputes.

### 2ac -- extinction first 

#### Extinction is A big deal 

**Torres 16** (Phil Torres; founding director of the X-Risks Institute,
an affiliate scholar at the Institute for Ethics and Emerging
Technologies;
<https://thebulletin.org/2016/09/how-likely-is-an-existential-catastrophe/>;
9-7-16)

In the past few decades, [the number of existential risk scenarios has
risen]{.underline}, and **[it will likely rise even more this
century]{.underline}**. Consider that only 72 years ago, prior to the
first atomic bomb exploding in the New Mexico desert, Homo sapiensfaced
only a handful of existential risks---all of them natural---including
asteroid and comet impacts, supervolcanic eruptions, and global
pandemics. Today the situation is quite different: **[Anthropogenic
risks such as climate change, [biodiversity
loss](http://www.thebulletin.org/biodiversity-loss-existential-risk-comparable-climate-change9329),
and nuclear weapons now haunt our species]{.underline}**. In addition,
[a swarm of [emerging
risks](http://www.globalchallenges.org/reports/Global-Catastrophic-Risk-Annual-Report-2016.pdf)
hover on the horizon]{.underline}: an engineered pandemic, a war
involving nanotech weapons, self-replicating nanobots, geoengineering,
and artificial superintelligence. If this trend continues into the
future, **[we should expect even more existential risk scenarios before
the 22nd century.]{.underline}** The increasing number of risk scenarios
suggests that **[the overall probability of disaster may have risen as
well]{.underline}**. [The more landmines]{.underline} placed [in a
field, the more likely one is to step in the wrong place]{.underline}.
According to the best estimates available, [the probability of a
doomsday catastrophe has]{.underline} indeed [increased over the same
period of time]{.underline}. For example, an [informal
survey](http://www.global-catastrophic-risks.com/docs/2008-1.pdf) of 19
experts conducted by the Future of Humanity Institute in 2008 yielded a
19 percent chance of human extinction this century. And Sir Martin
[Rees]{.underline}, co-founder of the Centre for the Study of
Existential Risk at Cambridge University,
[[argues](http://longnow.org/seminars/02010/aug/02/lifes-future-cosmos/)
that civilization has no better than a 50-50 chance of making it through
the 21st century intact.]{.underline} These estimates are far higher
than the probability of doom brought about by any natural phenomenon
before the Atomic Age. Putting risks in perspective. To underline the
urgency of existential risks, let's compare these estimates to the
[probability of an average American dying in an "air and space transport
accident"](http://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/mortality-risk)---which is
1 in 9,737 over the course of a roughly 80-year lifetime. As mentioned
above, the Future of Humanity Institute survey participants assigned a
19 percent chance of human extinction by the year 2100, which would mean
that [the average American is]{.underline} at least [[1,500 times more
likely](https://media.wix.com/ugd/d9aaad_a2bb594c8ead4ce5bbfc8e8a54534b50.pdf)
to die in a human extinction catastrophe than in a plane
crash.]{.underline}

[[Geography means]{.underline}]{.mark} that a [U.S. [invasion
of]{.mark}]{.underline} mainland [[China is]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[virtually [unthinkable]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as is [a Chinese
invasion of the United States]{.underline}. [Today's [Pacific

[than]{.underline}]{.mark} [Central [Europe]{.mark}]{.underline} [[in
1914 or]{.mark} 19[39]{.mark}]{.underline}. There, an enemy taking and
holding crucial territory was a legitimate fear. Of course, the roots of
pessimists' fears do not stem from a fear of large-scale invasion
launched by the United States or China against the other great power.
Rather, there are three arenas where conflict between the United States
and China is most likely: the South China Sea, the Senkaku Islands, and
Taiwan. China views itself as the rightful first-order power in East
Asia. Assuming China's capabilities continue to grow, it will likely use
its power to the shape the region towards its interests. It is no secret
that [the [R]{.mark}]{.underline}epublic [[o]{.underline}]{.mark}f
[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}hina's [[sovereignty]{.mark} ha]{.underline}s

[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} probably [use]{.underline} some combination
of diplomatic, economic, and political [power to **[undermine

Taiwanese sovereignty is within the purview of America's strict national
interest, then conflict will be difficult to avoid. However,
[[if]{.underline}]{.mark} (somewhat coldly) [[the

conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}, at least [over Taiwan]{.underline},
**[[can be avoided]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Even]{.underline} the
[[conquest of Taiwan]{.underline} **[would not make

### Containment Fails 

#### Containment fails

University, Ryan Devries has a BA from Calvin College, "Chinese
State-Society Relations: Why Beijing Isn't Trembling and Containment
Won't Work", article "Carnegie Endowment for International Peace",
https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/03/14/chinese-state-society-relations-why-beijing-isn-t-trembling-and-containment-won-t-work-pub-78596

WHY A [CONTAINMENT]{.underline} STRATEGY [DOESN'T HOLD
WATER]{.underline} This analysis is not intended to imply that democracy
is eternally ill-suited for China or that the current government's
repression is excusable. Rather, the point is that [Western
policymakers]{.underline} pondering how to respond to China's
authoritarian turn [should ground]{.underline} their [decisions in how
China actually is]{.underline}, [not how they]{.underline} might [wish
it were.]{.underline} That is why [it would be]{.underline} exceedingly
foolish and [counterproductive]{.underline} for the United States and
other Western nations [to try to undermine]{.underline} and weaken [the
Communist Party]{.underline} regime [by way of]{.underline} a Cold
War--style [containment]{.underline} policy. [The chances of success are
minuscule]{.underline}. [China is too enmeshed in global markets and its
economic clout is too considerable]{.underline} for containment to work.
Equally important, outside pressure of this sort would not drive a wedge
between China's rulers and ordinary Chinese people. Instead, [such a
strategy would]{.underline} likely [spook]{.underline} many Chinese
[citizens into rallying around]{.underline} government-sponsored
[nationalism]{.underline}, validating deep-seated suspicions that
so-called hostile foreign forces seek to prevent China's resurgence. And
even on the off-chance that Western pressure did succeed, [Chinese
society would]{.underline} almost certainly [fragment in chaotic ways
with disastrous ripple effects]{.underline} abroad. There are more
prudent steps Washington can take to put the relationship on surer
footing. First, influential figures in both countries should take a
stand against both reckless verbal sparring and hollow platitudes about
win-win propositions. [The relationship is undoubtedly becoming more
competitive]{.underline}, but this shift should be managed with
clear-eyed tactfulness and a strong appreciation of the need to maintain
cooperation with Beijing in critical areas such as WMD nonproliferation,
climate change, and economics. At the same time, to avoid or minimize
inadvertent U.S.-China crises, policymakers should strengthen both Track
I and Track II civil-military crisis management dialogues. Second,
Washington should strive to tackle its economic disputes with Beijing
shrewdly. The United States should present its top priorities far more
clearly, downplaying the misplaced emphasis on the trade balance in
favor of a primary focus on commercial cyber espionage, uneven market
access, and the creation of mutually beneficial and integrated economic
structures in Asia. Furthermore, trade talks should leverage the fact
that many U.S. partners in Europe and elsewhere harbor similar economic
concerns and desires. Possible solutions should be framed to Beijing not
as outright concessions to Western demands but as sorely needed reforms
in line with China's own domestic plans for economic restructuring.
Third, U.S. policymakers should proactively map out the challenges and
difficult choices they will face as Asia's strategic landscape continues
to shift. Congress should hold hearings focused on assessing how [the
changing contours of Asia's]{.underline} security, economic, and
political [domains will affect]{.underline} regional [stability
and]{.underline} other [U.S. interests]{.underline}. The long-term goal
should be to explore how Beijing and Washington can both take steps to
defuse regional hotspots and create at least the preconditions for a
genuine, stable balance of power in Asia. Like it or not, the Communist
Party government leading China today is rooted in deep historical and
political impulses. And while it is not the only conceivable regime that
could meet the Chinese people's long-term needs, an[y more
representative and less repressive Chinese government will need to
emerge on its own terms.]{.underline} In the meantime, [the United
States should pursue and protect its interests in farsighted ways that
increase the likelihood that its concerns about Chinese behavior will be
addressed while minimizing the risks of counterproductive
blowback.]{.underline}

#### Current Chinese containment fails

the Soviet way. Instead, it could explode into armed conflict", article

https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/united-states/article/2164221/us-cold-war-containment-strategy-against-china

For months, [the United States and China have been exchanging blows over
trade]{.underline}. What began with the Trump administration imposing
tariffs on a handful of goods earlier this year has ballooned into a
list that includes thousands of items. In July, [Trump]{.underline}
announced that he [is prepared to impose tariffs on all]{.underline}
US\$500 billion of [imports from China]{.underline}. [The
showdown]{.underline} between the world's two economic powerhouses [has
shaken the global financial system]{.underline} to its core. Over the
summer, the World Bank warned that the trade war could trigger a drop in
global trade of as much as 9 per cent, the type of economic shock the
world hasn't seen since the 2008 financial crisis. But, in recent weeks,
[China]{.underline} has begun to [suspect]{.underline} that [the trade
war is]{.underline} about more than just economics. Chinese officials
and academics have indicated that they see the trade war as a piece of a
bigger puzzle, a grand strategy reminiscent of the cold war policy of
[containment intended to thwart China's rise. This is]{.underline} a
[danger]{.underline}ous development [that has profound implications for
strategic stability]{.underline}. [Containment]{.underline} was designed
shortly after the second world war as a means of curbing Soviet
expansionism. At its core, containment sought to confront the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) through back door channels, support
for anti-communist forces, and all other means short of direct, armed
confrontation. The driving [philosophy]{.underline} behind the policy
[was that the Soviet system]{.underline} was rotten at its core and
[would]{.underline} eventually [collapse on its own]{.underline}. Sure
enough, in 1989, the Berlin Wall came tumbling down and, by 1991, the
Soviet Union had fully dissolved. Although [containment]{.underline}
worked in this case, it is a policy that [entails great
risk]{.underline}. [An adversary]{.underline} who [feels backed into a
corner is prone to lash out]{.underline} and take greater risks to
achieve limited gains and avoid losing face. This was the case with the
Soviet Union, which found itself locked in an ideological struggle with
a technologically superior foe. [During the Cuban missile
crisis]{.underline}, Nikita [Khrushchev tried to rectify this imbalance
by stationing nuclear missiles]{.underline} capable of striking the US
[on Cuba]{.underline}. But Khrushchev overplayed his hand. The US
detected the transfer before it was complete and [the confrontation
nearly escalated into]{.underline} a full-blown **[nuclear
war]{.underline}**. Although the cold war ended peacefully, [we are
lucky to have got out of it alive.]{.underline} [China,]{.underline}
however, [is no Soviet Union]{.underline}. Since opening up to the
outside world 40 years ago, China has developed into a vibrant economic
behemoth. [China's]{.underline} **[g]{.underline}**ross
**[d]{.underline}**omestic **[p]{.underline}**roduct in purchasing power
parity terms [is much larger than the US']{.underline} and it is poised
to become the world's largest market for consumer goods. [China's
economy is growing at twice the rate of the global economy]{.underline},
and [by 2028]{.underline}, [is likely to dethrone the US]{.underline} as
the world's largest economy as measured by GDP. In short, [it
is]{.underline} highly [unlikely]{.underline} that [the
Chinese]{.underline} system [will fade into obscurity]{.underline}. Yet
[this is the path]{.underline} the [Trump]{.underline} administration
[has chosen]{.underline}. In January, the US labelled China a strategic
competitor in its National Defence Strategy. Recent US moves to expand
ties to Taiwan have only made matters worse. Just last month, the
[Trump]{.underline} administration [passed]{.underline} a bill making it
harder for Chinese companies to acquire high-end technology. Shi
Yinhong, a foreign affairs adviser to China's State Council, called the
move "[hi-tech containment]{.underline}". People's Daily accused the US
of seeking global hegemony, and proclaimed that China should be
determined to fight. And fight they might. [China has developed a
powerful regional military that is likely to win any fight]{.underline}
it picks in its own backyard, particularly [in the South China
Sea]{.underline}. Chinese and US [military forces already spar
regularly]{.underline} in the region as the US asserts its freedom of
navigation rights in waters claimed by China. [By
implementing]{.underline} a policy of [containment]{.underline} towards
China and labelling it as a de facto enemy, the [Trump]{.underline}
administration [is pouring fuel on the fire]{.underline},
[increasing]{.underline} tensions, and with it, [the likelihood
that]{.underline} one of these [confrontations]{.underline} could
[escalate]{.underline} out of control. [Consider the
following]{.underline} hypothetical scenario: [a US
destroyer]{.underline} is harassed by Chinese coastguard vessels during
a freedom of navigation patrol. [Unable to change course]{.underline},
the US warship [rams one]{.underline} of the [Chinese
vessel]{.underline}s, killing dozens of sailors. To [China]{.underline},
this an act of aggression in its territorial waters, and they [call for
reinforcements to apprehend the destroyer's crew]{.underline}. From a US
perspective, this was an accident that took place in international
waters. [The crew refuses to surrender]{.underline}. [With tensions
soaring]{.underline} the chain of command breaks down. [Someone panics
and shoots]{.underline}. [The ensuing fight escalates into a full-blown
naval battle with]{.underline} multiple [Chinese ships]{.underline}
[sunk as well as a US\$3 billion US destroyer]{.underline} with all
hands. Through a series of unfortunate events, [two nuclear armed
superpowers find themselves in an armed conflict]{.underline} that
nobody wants. [War]{.underline} between the US and China [would be an
unmitigated disaster]{.underline} for both parties. Both countries
depend on each other to thrive, but that doesn't mean that war couldn't
happen. History has taught us that [when national pride is involved and
one party]{.underline} (or both) [feels trapped]{.underline} in a
corner, simmering [tensions can erupt]{.underline} into a roaring blaze.
We can only hope that someone in the Trump administration was paying
attention during that lesson.

Despite good intentions, **[the policy of ramping up arms sales to
Taiwan in an attempt to maintain a balance of force across the Taiwan
Strait is both misguided and dangerous]{.underline}**. The goal of
achieving a balance of power across the Taiwan Strait should not be
overemphasized.42 Achieving a balance of forces across the Strait is not
an end in itself. Instead, it should be viewed as means to the peaceful
resolution of the current stalemate. As a result, Taiwan does not
actually need to be able to defend itself without outside support. The
very idea is unsustainable. [The rate of China's economic and military
growth makes any unilateral attempt by Taiwan to maintain a military
balance across the Strait impossible]{.underline} in the long term.
Instead, [a sense of balance across the Strait relies on the implicit
possibility that the United States would become involved in a
Sino-Taiwanese dispute]{.underline}. **[One way that the U.S. signals
this commitment is through periodic arms sales]{.underline}**.43 [Given
the symbolic nature of such sales]{.underline}, they do not need to
include a considerable quantity of advanced weaponry, as their purpose
is not to alter the balance of power across the Strait. Even if ramping
up arms sales to Taiwan cannot forestall the development of an
asymmetrical balance between Taiwanese and Chinese forces, is there any
harm in selling increased quantities of advanced arms to Taiwan to help
alleviate pressure on the U.S. military? [There are]{.underline}
actually [a number of risks entailed in]{.underline} ramping up [arms
sales to Taiwan]{.underline}. As Wei-Chin Lee observes in Issues and
Studies, "[the unrestrained and unconditional supply of advanced weapons
to Taiwan could have the effect of upsetting the status quo in the
region]{.underline}"44 It is possible, for example, that an expansion of
arms packages would embolden Taipei by creating the impression of
unconditional American support. [This might then lead Taiwanese leaders
to take a risk and declare independence on the assumption that the U.S.
would support them against China. This would almost undoubtedly provoke
a military reaction from China]{.underline}, as [declaring independence
steps over the red lines]{.underline} set out by China's Anti-Succession
Law. The United States, as Taiwan's guarantor, would then be under
considerable pressure to meet China's aggression. This is clearly a
position that the United States has a vested interest in avoiding, due
to the potential for a nuclear conflict. What is the likelihood that
increased arms sales would actually embolden Taiwan enough to rashly
declare independence? It is hard to say, but recent improvements in
Sino-Taiwanese relations makes it somewhat unlikely. However, given the
catastrophic consequences of such an event, **[even the slightest
possibility of U.S. entrapment in a Sino-Taiwanese conflict ought to be
avoided.]{.underline}**

Drawing on the discussion above, it is clear [that neither abandoning
nor unconditionally arming Taiwan is in the interest of the United
States]{.underline}. Instead, it seems to be in America's best interests
to find a careful balance between the two extremes. A third policy
option, which is the one this paper maintains is **[the most appropriate
for the U.S. to adopt]{.underline}**, **[is the policy of strategic
ambiguity.]{.underline}** Essentially, it is a policy of dual
deterrence. [It entails simultaneously deterring China from invading
Taiwan and deterring Taiwan from declaring independence]{.underline}. It
is also an approach that has a distinguished pedigree. It was first
adopted by the Eisenhower administration in the 1950s, as a means of
preventing both China from invading Taiwan and Taiwan from sparking a
war with China by declaring independence---thereby avoiding resources
being drawn away from the ongoing conflict in Korea.45 To this very day,
the situation in the Taiwan Strait remains remarkably similar. It
continues to remain outside the interests of the United States to see
either Taiwan break from China or see China feel emboldened enough to
attack Taiwan. To deploy such a policy, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [ought to continue arms sales to
Taiwan]{.underline}, as is the current administration's policy.
[However, care should be taken to make sure such sales remain limited in
scope]{.underline}. [It should be unclear to both the PRC and Taiwan as
to whether or not the U.S. will become involved in any sort of crisis in
the Strait]{.underline}. This policy does not heavily rely on
maintaining a balance of power across the strait. Instead, arms sales
become more of a symbolic commitment by the United States to defend
Taiwan in the event of an attack. At the same time, **[limiting
arms]{.underline}** sales also **[signals that U.S. support for Taiwan
has concrete limits]{.underline}**, **[thereby discouraging rash action
on the part of Taipei]{.underline}**. This approach also has the benefit
of balancing the United States' commitments under the TRA to arm Taiwan
with its commitments under the August Communiqué to not sell increasing
levels of arms to Taiwan. Of the three options discussed, **[strategic
ambiguity is the policy that has the best chance of eventually leading
to a peaceful resolution of cross-Strait tension]{.underline}**. It
explicitly avoids conflict by maintaining the current status quo. It is
under this very status quo that Sino-Taiwanese relations have recently
begun to flourish. Such links may remain primarily economic in nature
for the moment. However, they may one day develop into a political
understanding as well. Essentially, the policy of strategic ambiguity
works to prevent the eruption of conflict that would shatter the dream
of peaceful reunification. It is also the policy that entails the least
risk for the United States---though it does require constant vigilance,
lest Taiwan or China become too emboldened. As it is both low risk and
consistent with America's long term goals, strategic ambiguity remains
the best approach to dealing with conflict over Taiwan.

maintenance crews. The State Department said the sale is meant to
improve the defensive capabilities of Taiwan. Senior Colonel Wu Qian, a
spokesman for the ministry, said in an online statement that China
resolutely opposes any country selling arms to or having military
interactions with Taiwan. \"[The action by the US has seriously violated
the one-China principle and the three Sino-US joint

the move \"a complete mistake and very dangerous\". The Taiwan question
is related to China\'s sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as
its core interests, and it is the most sensitive issue in Sino-US ties,
he said. Wu said Taiwan\'s attempt to rely on foreign forces and the US
using Taiwan to contain China are doomed to fail. China demands that the
US immediately cancel related arms sales to Taiwan and stop all military
interaction with the island to avoid further damage to Sino-US military
relations, bilateral ties and the peace and security of the Taiwan
Straits, he said. \"[The Chinese military has the resolve, confidence

Regional Effects. [Arms sales]{.underline} do not just affect the
recipient nation; they also [affect the]{.underline} local [balance of
power]{.underline}, often [causing ripple effects throughout the
region]{.underline}. Though advocates of arms sales trumpet their
stabilizing influence, as we have noted above, [arms sales often lead to
greater tension, less stability, and more conflict]{.underline}. Because
of this --- and the complementary problem of weapons dispersion --- the
regional impact of arms sales is less predictable and more problematic
than advocates acknowledge. Instability, Violence, and Conflict. First,
arms sales can make conflict more likely.79 This may occur because
recipients of new weapons feel more confident about launching attacks or
because changes in the local balance of power can fuel tensions and
promote preventive strikes by others. A study of arms sales from 1950 to
1995, for example, found that although arms sales appeared to have some
restraining effect on major-power allies, they had the opposite effect
in other cases, and concluded that "increased arms transfers from major
powers make states significantly more likely to be militarized dispute
initiators."80 Another study focused on sub-Saharan Africa from 1967 to
1997 found that "arms transfers are significant and positive predictors
of increased probability of war."81 Recent history provides supporting
evidence for these findings: since 2011, Saudi Arabia, the leading buyer
of American weapons, has intervened to varying degrees in Yemen,
Tunisia, Syria, and Qatar. Second, arms sales can also prolong and
intensify ongoing conflicts and erode rather than promote regional
stability. Few governments, and fewer insurgencies, have large enough
weapons stocks to fight for long without resupply.82 The tendency of
external powers to arm the side they support, however understandable
strategically, has the inevitable result of allowing the conflict to
continue at a higher level of intensity than would otherwise be the
case. As one study of arms sales to Africa notes, "Weapons imports are
essential additives in this recipe for armed conflict and carnage."83
Third, this dynamic appears to be particularly troublesome with respect
to internal conflicts. Jennifer Erickson, for example, found that
recipients of major conventional weapons are 70 percent more likely to
engage in internal conflicts than other states. Though halting arms
sales alone is not a panacea for peace and stability, arms embargoes can
help lessen the destructiveness of combat in both civil and interstate
wars simply by restricting access to the means of violence.84 Finally,
because of their effects on both interstate and internal conflict, arms
sales can also erode rather than promote regional stability. As noted in
the previous section, [where the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [seeks to manage regional balances of power, arms
sales often create tension]{.underline}, whether [because the American
role in the region threatens others or because American clients feel
emboldened]{.underline}. The Middle East, for example, has seesawed
between violence and tense standoffs for the past many decades, at first
because of Cold War competition and more recently because of the
American war on terror. The notion that increased U.S. arms sales since
9/11 made the Middle East more stable is far-fetched to say the least.
Similarly, though [many argue]{.underline} that American security
[commitments to]{.underline} countries like Japan, [Taiwan]{.underline},
and South Korea [have produced greater stability]{.underline}, [there is
a strong case to be made that the opposite is now true]{.underline}.
American support of South Korea has driven North Korea to develop
nuclear weapons; the presence of U.S. missile defense systems in South
Korea has aggravated China, and [American support of Taiwan produces
continual tension between the two powers]{.underline}.85

### AT Incrementalism / Weapons PICs -- Cant Solve Tensions

#### Ending ALL arms sales to Taiwan defuses war with China and boosts nonprolif regimes

[Forgoing arms sales is likely to be a superior strategy]{.underline}
even in cases where the United States has an entrenched interest. [In
the case of Taiwan]{.underline}, for example, though it is clear that
Taiwan needs to purchase weapons from other countries to provide for its
defense, those weapons do not have to be made in the United States.
Having Taiwan buy from other suppliers would help defuse U.S.-China
tensions. [Even if Taiwan's defenses remained robust, China would
clearly prefer a situation in which American arms no longer signal an
implicit promise to fight on Taiwan's behalf. This could also promote
more productive U.S.-China diplomacy]{.underline} in general, [as well
as greater stability in the Pacific region]{.underline}. Most
important[, breaking off arms sales would also reduce the likelihood of
the United States becoming entangled in a future conflict between Taiwan
and China. The second major benefit]{.underline} of reducing arms sales
is that it [would imbue the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[with greater moral authority]{.underline}. Today, as the leading
arms-dealing nation in the world, the United States lacks credibility in
discussions of arms control and nonproliferation, especially in light of
its military interventionism since 2001. [By showing the world that it
is ready to choose diplomacy over the arms trade, the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would provide a huge boost to
international efforts to curtail proliferation]{.underline} and its
negative consequences. This is important because the United States has
pursued and will continue to pursue a wide range of arms control and
nonproliferation objectives. The United States is a signatory of
treaties dealing with weapons of mass destruction, missile technology,
land mines, and cluster munitions, not to mention the flow of
conventional weapons of all kinds. [The effectiveness of these
treaties]{.underline}, and the ability to create more effective and
enduring arms control and nonproliferation frameworks, however, [depends
on how the United States behaves.]{.underline}

Taiwan's Ministry of Defense will formally declare its intention to
procure fifth generation Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II fighter
aircraft to U.S. officials in July, according to the country's Minister
of National Defense Feng Shih-kuan. Addressing a meeting of the
Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee in late April,
Taiwan's defense minister stated that **[ministry
representatives]{.underline}** will formally **[declare Taiwan's
intention to purchase the F-35 fighter jet to their U.S.
counterparts]{.underline}** in July during a visit to Washington, the
Taipei Times
[reports](http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2017/04/21/2003669124).
The United States has so far not filled key political appointee
positions which would cover U.S.-Taiwan defense relations, which,
according to the minister is the reason for the delayed request.
"Because the appointments of \[US\] officials have not yet been
completed, \[a formal proposal\] would be made to Washington in July,"
he said. The minister also bluntly stated to Taiwanese lawmakers that
the reason for the request is in response to "the enemy's military
development." G**[iven]{.underline}** U.S. President Donald **[Trump's
increasingly softer stance on China]{.underline}**,
**[which]{.underline}** vehemently **[objects]{.underline}** to the
**[sale of F-35s]{.underline}** to Taiwan, there are questions about
whether Taiwan will succeed in convincing the White House to approve the
sale in the immediate future. The **[Trump]{.underline}** administration
**[is currently drafting a new arms package for Taiwan]{.underline}**,
[which according to some sources will heavily tilt towards anti-ship,
surface-to-air, and surface-to-surface missile systems]{.underline}.
**[The package is expected to exceed \$1 billion in
value]{.underline}**. One of the key questions regarding the Trump
administration's arms package whether it will include U.S. technical
support for Taiwan's new so-called Indigenous Defense Submarine (IDS)
program. While supporting the program would send a clear political
message to Beijing, "U.S. technical support may be of limited value in
any case given that no American shipyard has built a diesel electric
submarine since the 1950s," I
[explained](https://thediplomat.com/2017/03/taiwan-to-build-own-attack-submarines-within-next-10-years/)

sell [advanced MK-48 heavyweight
torpedoes](https://thediplomat.com/2016/09/us-agrees-to-supply-taiwan-with-advanced-torpedoes/)
to Taiwan in 2016 and the weapons could be part of the Trump
administration's arms package.

As far as the PLA is concerned, [the Sino-U.S. military ties are the
vulnerable point in the overall relations and will likely worsen with
power transition deepening in the region]{.underline}. Under this logic
of evolution, there is little both militaries can do to reverse the
trend given the zero-sum nature of the contention. Institutionally, the
U.S. military is forbidden to maintain substantial contacts with the PLA
by U.S. law. For instance, the U.S. 2000 National Defense Authorization
Act singles out 12 areas where the U.S. military should not interact
with the PLA, leaving the bilateral cooperation only in those less than
meaningful agendas such as antipiracy and humanitarian assistance.80 The
previously mentioned "third party factor," such as the Taiwan issue, has
set insurmountable barriers for both parties to address the challenge of
"trust deficits." [If the current strife is not eased, the two
militaries will be gradually locked in a collision course and catch
Taiwan in the cross-fire. For instance, both militaries regard U.S. arms
sales to Taiwan to be more of a political issue than a military one. To
the United States it is even of only symbolic military
significance]{.underline}.81 The outcome is strikingly different. [The
Pentagon refuses to discuss the issue with the PLA due to its
"political" nature.]{.underline} Technically, the PLA would not care too
much about the sold arms, which would not alter the Strait balance of
power. [However, Beijing's political depiction that the sales are
violating China's sovereignty fundamentally clashes with Washington's
view that arms sales to Taiwan are a symbol of U.S. security commitment
to its allies and partners to sustain its global and regional
leadership. The sales will continue, partly because they commercially
benefit the United States and partly because the political cost is
relatively low]{.underline}.82 When China and the United States cannot
deal with the thorn, and politically it is unresolvable, the option left
to the PLA is very limited: suspension of military ties, set by Deng
Xiaoping and tried six times so far. In fact, such an option is
increasingly ineffective and entraps Beijing in the process. In a way,
the new package of arms sales in July 2017 approved by Trump was
moderate in content, although significant in expressing continued U.S.
support to Taiwan by the new administration. [The PLA has not adopted
the usual countermeasure of suspension of ties with the U.S. military.
Yet the dilemma lingers on and the solution is nowhere in sight. The
fatal test will emerge when the Pentagon crosses a PLA red line on arms
sales: the F-35s or submarines. Damocles' sword hangs
above]{.underline}.

\"Taiwan Won\'t Get U.S. Fighter Jets While Trump Seeks a China Deal,\"

The [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} Administration [has [put on

of]{.mark}]{.underline} [[jet]{.mark} fighters [to
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline} [[until the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} **[seals a [trade deal with
China]{.mark}]{.underline}**, three Administration officials told TIME
on Thursday. That decision has contributed to concern among some in the
Administration that the President may soon go soft on China in his
desire to secure a trade deal. The draft trade agreement currently under
negotiation would boost Trump's political fortunes and ease the jittery
stock market, but it is unlikely to address many of the issues at the
core of the U.S.-China trade dispute, said the U.S. officials, who spoke
anonymously because they aren't authorized to discuss the matter
publicly. The move underscores the complexity and difficulty of
balancing U.S. relations with an increasingly powerful China against the
American commitment to help Taiwan defend itself. The White House's
initial decision, first reported late last month, to offer tacit
approval for Taiwan to buy 60 Lockheed Martin F-16V fighter jets was
widely seen as a U.S. show of strength against China. The sale would be
the first time the U.S. has sold F-16s to Taiwan since 1992. While the
U.S. has a statutory obligation to aid Taiwan's defense in its
decades-long standoff with China, recent administrations have stopped
short of allowing the island to buy new fighter jets. [The
[Trump]{.mark} Administration's apparent [pause]{.mark} on the arms sale
therefore [represents]{.mark} a new [deference to
China]{.mark}]{.underline}. The U.S. officials who spoke to TIME noted
that the Trump Administration's decision to temporarily set aside the
Taiwan arms sale has not rattled Taipei. Taiwanese officials remain
confident that the arms sale will be completed after the U.S. and China
reach a deal, and that reduced Sino-American tensions are seen as better
for the island than allowing the countries' trade dispute, which has
resulted in more than a year of damaging, retaliatory tariffs, to
escalate, they said. [[Congress must]{.mark} also [approve]{.mark} of
any arms [sales to Taiwan]{.mark}, and [the Admin]{.mark}istration [has

statement to TIME on Monday: "While as a matter of policy we don't
comment on potential or pending arms sales cases before they are

regarding arms sales processes were incorrect.

Chinese government overthrown in the 1949 Communist Revolution, reacted
quickly to [a report suggesting that Trump's team has put a hold on the
arms deals in the midst of a trade war with China.]{.underline} "The
U.S. sale of F-16V fighter jets to Taiwan has not been put on hold," the
state-run outlet maintained, citing the Foreign Ministry. [But earlier
this week it appeared the deal was off. "That decision has contributed
to concern among some in the Administration that the President may soon
go soft on China in his desire to secure a trade deal,"]{.underline}
according to Time, which reported the decision. "The move underscores
the complexity and difficulty of balancing U.S. relations with an
increasingly powerful China against the American commitment to help
Taiwan defend itself."

[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and

a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**major [confrontation]{.mark}**
[over]{.mark}]{.underline} the possible [[sale of]{.mark} American
[fighters to Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}. Last week, Taiwanese President

[[request]{.mark} to Washington]{.underline}, D.C., [[to
purchase]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[F-16]{.mark}V Viper
[fighters]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Tsai said the decision to make the
request was supported by a review of Taiwan's defense needs. Days later,
Bloomberg News reported that [the White House was poised to approve the
Taiwanese request]{.underline}. If that report is true, th[e
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would be **turning
course**]{.underline} [on]{.underline} what has been a longstanding
[reluctance to sell fighters to Taiwan]{.underline}, even as it has
authorized other arms sales in line with the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act,
which requires the U.S. government to support Taiwan "with arms of a
defensive character." Even as the Obama administration and the Trump
administration have approved weapons and spare parts for sale to Taiwan,
[[fighters have]{.mark} long [been seen as]{.mark}]{.underline} **[a
bridge [too far]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[given]{.mark} [Beijing]{.mark}
serious [reservations]{.mark}]{.underline}. The United States authorized
the sale of 150 F-16 fighters to Taiwan in 1992. The Obama
administration, after receiving a request from Taipei, turned it down,
initiating a set of upgrades instead to Taipei's existing fleet. [The
issue hasn't gone unnoticed in China]{.underline}, where Taiwan is seen
as an inherent part of the country. [[Relations]{.underline}]{.mark}
across the Taiwan Strait [[have been]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[particularly [strained]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[since Tsai's
inauguration]{.mark} in 2016]{.underline}. The Taiwanese president hails
from the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), though
she herself has not explicitly supported independence --- long a
red-line for Beijing --- [[Tsai]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [has
[refused to endorse]{.mark} the]{.underline} so-called "[[1992

[supported]{.mark}]{.underline} and [[which forms]{.mark} what Beijing
sees as]{.underline} **[[the baseline for]{.mark} cordial cross-strait

prospect of a fighter sale to Taiwan this time comes at a time of
particularly heightened U.S.-China tensions. The Trump administration
has been known to seek leverage with Beijing across issues and it is
possible that this may turn into the latest case of Taiwan being used a
possible bargaining chip as Trump seeks to clinch a favorable trade deal
with Chinese President Xi Jinping. [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark},
however, has been unconventional on Taiwan policy in the past. As

### AT F-16 PIC -- Must End All Arms Sales 

#### Selling F-16 signals to china US supports Taiwan split 

**Lee 4-3-19,** Professor John Lee is a senior fellow at the Hudson
Institute in Washington DC and United States Studies Center in Sydney.
From 2016-18, he was the national security adviser to the Australian
foreign minister."Why a US Sale of Fighter Jets to Taiwan Matters",
April 3^rd^, 2019, accessed:6/28/18,
https://thediplomat.com/2019/04/why-a-us-sale-of-fighter-jets-to-taiwan-matters/)

In late March, Bloomberg reported that U.S. President Donald Trump's
advisers had encouraged Taiwan to submit a formal request to buy up to
60 advanced F-16V fighter planes. Any sale must still be approved by
Congress and would be the first major aircraft purchase from the United
States by Taiwan since 1992. During her visit to Hawaii last week,
[[Taiwanese President]{.underline}]{.mark} Tsai Ing-wen
[[confirmed]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark} had
[[requested a purchase of new fighter jets from]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates. [[Days
later]{.underline}]{.mark}, two [[Chinese fighter planes
crossed]{.underline}]{.mark} the median line in [[the Taiwan
Strait]{.underline}]{.mark} that divides China and Taiwan -- the [first
time]{.underline} this has occurred [for 20 years]{.underline}. [[Even
if]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[F-16V]{.underline}]{.mark} [[sale goes
ahead]{.underline}]{.mark}, Taiwan's new [[planes will not alter the
military balance between China and Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[nor
dissuade]{.underline}]{.mark} the mainland from further
[[provocations]{.underline}]{.mark} such as the median line flyover.
That is not Beijing's primary concern, however. The most important
[[calculation China must make]{.underline}]{.mark} is not the relative
capabilities of the Taiwanese armed forces but [[how the United States
will respond]{.mark} in the event of a crisis or [conflict in the Taiwan
Strait.]{.mark}]{.underline} Every clue with respect to uncovering U.S.
intention is vital because U.S. intervention could tip the military
balance against China in any such conflict. In any event, [[it
guarantees the end]{.underline}]{.mark} of any "acceptable cost"
[[outcome]{.underline}]{.mark} in the event of [[conflict for
China.]{.mark}]{.underline} Under the United States' 1979 Taiwan
Relations Act, any attempt to forcibly determine Taiwan's future is
considered "a threat to peace and security of the Western Pacific and of
grave concern to the United States." To prevent that, Washington is
obligated to sell "arms of a defensive character" to Taipei to allow the
latter to defend itself and dissuade China from launching any military
action. [Since the Bill Clinton era, administrations have denied
Taiwan's request to purchase new fighter planes on the basis that the
grey line from "defense" to "offense" might be crossed.]{.underline}
Speaking from Hawaii, Tsai let the cat out of the bag when she said the
purchase of advanced fourth generation fighters would "greatly enhance
our land and air capabilities, strengthen military moral and show to the
world the U.S. commitment to Taiwan's defense." It is the last line
which sends shivers down the spine of mainland leaders. Since the Taiwan
Relations Act came into force, the United States has deliberately
embarked on a policy of "strategic ambiguity" with respect to its
military commitments to Taiwan in the event the latter is attacked.
Whether the United States intervenes is a matter of political judgment
and strategic assessment. Under the Barack Obama administration, the
decision to only offer Taipei upgrades to its aging F-16 A/B planes
suggested to Beijing that de-escalating tensions arising from
differences over Taiwan was the predominant mindset. In contrast, the
Trump administration has shown unprecedented willingness to escalate
tensions with China over political, strategic, and economic differences.
The speech by Vice President Mike Pence last October at the Hudson
Institute and the 2017 National Security Strategy pulled no punches in
identifying China as a comprehensive rival to the United States. If the
sale of F-16V planes goes through, then, it is evidence that the mindset
in Washington with respect to Taiwan has also changed and is less
accepting of mainland sensibilities and demands. Such [[a sale would be
an indication]{.underline}]{.mark} that preserving de facto [[Taiwanese
independence]{.underline}]{.mark} is once more [[considered critical to
U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} and allied [[strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}
when it comes to keeping the PLA confined to inside the so-called First
Island Chain.

Trump\'s sale of F-16 fighters to Taiwan seen making China nervous
politically ; 4-1-19)

The U.S. may finally sell Taiwan the warplanes it has sought for more
than a decade to defend against China. Their arrival would deal more of
a political shock than a military blow to Beijing. Trump administration
[officials have given tacit approval to Taipei's request to buy
more]{.underline} than 60 Lockheed Martin Corp. [F-16s]{.underline},
according to people familiar with the matter, setting the stage for the
first such deal since 1992. While a few dozen fighter jets would hardly
tip the military balance against the increasing powerful Chinese
military, [it would signal a new American willingness to back the
democratically run island]{.underline}. "[For Beijing, it would be a
huge shock]{.underline}," said Wu Shang-su, a research fellow at the S.
Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. "But it would
be more of a political shock than a military shock. It would be, 'Oh,
the U.S. doesn't care how we feel.' It would be more of a symbolic or
emotional issue." The potential sale is among several gestures of U.S.
support for Taiwan in recent months, even as President Donald Trump and
Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping near a deal to end the costly trade war.
The U.S. also sailed a warship through the Taiwan Strait and
accommodated President Tsai Ing-wen's stopover in Hawaii last week,
drawing protests from [China]{.underline}, which [denounced the moves as
"extremely dangerous."]{.underline} Renewed U.S. interest in Taiwan
follows growing calls in Washington for a "whole-of-government" effort
to prevent China from surpassing American military and industrial
dominance. Perhaps nowhere has the power shift been felt more than on
Taiwan, an island of 23.6 million people that China aims to eventually
control despite 70 years of divided rule. [China has directed its
industrial strength toward huge investments in military
hardware]{.underline} over the past two decades, building a world-class
navy [and filling its coastline with missiles capable of hitting
Taiwanese]{.underline} [targets.]{.underline} The country spent 23 times
more than Taiwan on defense in 2017, up from double in 1997. New F-16s
won't "change the fundamental balance of capabilities across the strait,
nor will it eliminate the threat that China poses to forcibly absorb a
democratic Taiwan," said Scott Harold, an associate director of Rand
Corp.'s Center for Asia Pacific Policy. "Taiwan will continue to need to
invest in missiles, electronic warfare, mines and other advanced
conventional and asymmetric capabilities designed to deter, and if
necessary defeat, any Chinese effort to use coercion to compel
unification." Rand analysts argued in a 2016 report that [China's
sophisticated short-range ballistic missiles could "cut every runway at
Taiwan's half-dozen main fighter bases and destroy essentially all"
parked aircraft in a conflict]{.underline}. Any planes that made it in
the air could face Chinese pilots flying jets such as the J-20, a
"fifth-generation" stealth fighter considered to be a rival to
Lockheed's advanced F-22s and F-35s. Still, [the F-16 sale would
represent a shift by the U.S]{.underline}., which is obligated to sell
"arms of a defensive character" to Taipei under the 1979 Taiwan
Relations Act. Presidents since Bill Clinton have repeatedly rebuffed
Taiwan's requests for new fighter jets and other advanced weapons
systems that could provoke Beijing, with Barack Obama agreeing in 2011
to merely upgrade its aging F-16 fleet. Tsai said during her visit to
Hawaii on Wednesday that a fighter jet deal would "greatly enhance our
land and air capabilities, strengthen military morale and show to the
world the U.S.'s commitment to Taiwan's defense." The F-16Vs requested
by Taiwan are promoted as the world's most advanced fourth-generation
jet, including the latest radar and avionics, even though the original
F16 model has been in service for more than 40 years. The aircraft would
help the island respond day-to-day incidents such as air space
incursions that fall short of open war and mop up data during routine
patrols. [China]{.underline}, which suspended military exchanges with
the U.S. in response to previous sales, protested the F-16 move. The
[foreign ministry said the country lodged "stern representations" with
U.S. while the defense ministry warned against moves that undercut the
contention that the mainland and Taiwan are part of "one
China."]{.underline} "[Any words or actions that undermine the one-China
policy are tantamount to shaking the foundation of China-U.S.
relations]{.underline}, [are inconsistent with the fundamental interests
of China and the United States and are also extremely
dangerous]{.underline}," Senior Col. Wu Qian said at a briefing Thursday
in Beijing.

#### Selling F-16s to Taiwan angers China 

**Gertz 19**

The arms sales are being carried out under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act
that authorizes the United States to provide defensive weapons to Taiwan
to counter any mainland attack. [The last sale of 150
F-16]{.underline}A/B [models took place from 1992 to 199]{.underline}9
under the administration of President George H.W. Bush. [As with the
1992 transfers, the sale is expected to upset Beijing]{.underline},
which regards Taiwan as a breakaway province and not an independent
state. [After a smaller \$330 million arms sale for F-16 spare parts was
announced in September, Beijing spokesmen denounced the weapons
transfers as a violation of U.S.-China agreements.]{.underline} \"The
sales severely violate international law and basic norms governing
international relations, and [severely violate the one-China principle
as well as the principles of the three China-U.S. joint
communiques,\"]{.underline} Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said,
adding that China protested the earlier sale. [The Chinese military
protested the sale as interference in China\'s internal affairs and
damaging Chinese sovereignty and security interests.]{.underline} The
[official newspaper China Daily]{.underline} [stated]{.underline} that
same month that [the United States was threatening to cross a \"red
line\" with Taiwan arms sales]{.underline}. The Obama administration
sold around \$14 billion in arms to Taiwan. However, that administration
blocked a \$1 billion arms package in December 2016. In the first two
years of the Trump administration, a total of \$815.5 million in weapons
were sold to Taiwan. The aircraft sale is expected to boost that number
to around \$14 billion. China has stepped up pressure on the island in
recent months by conducting provocative military flights around Taiwan.
The island, located 100 miles from the southern Chinese coast, was set
up as the Republic of China in 1949 when Nationalist forces fled the
mainland during a civil war. The Pentagon 2018 report on the Chinese
military stated that the military balance is shifting in China\'s favor.
In terms of air power, between 2016 and 2017 China added 130 strike
aircraft and bombers, increasing the numbers from 400 to 530. The [jet
sales will be announced amid increasing tensions between Washington and
Beijing]{.underline}. Both remain locked in a trade dispute over
China\'s unfair trade practices and technology theft.

### AT QPQ CP w/ China

#### Unconditional concessions is key to relations 

**Wang, 2019**

Yuan-kang, Professor of Political Science at Western Michigan
University, "Rethinking US Security Commitment to Taiwan," Palgrave,
6/24/19, 10.1007/978-3-319-77125-0//WS

Over the decades, the US security commitment has kept the peace in the
Taiwan Strait, allowing cross-Strait social and economic exchanges to
flourish. China's rapid rise, however, puts stress on the international
system and foreshadows a dangerous power transition with the United
States. The structural stress is such that both the rising power's
dissatisfaction with the current system and the existing hegemon's fear
of being overtaken significantly increase the likelihood of war. Graham
Allison coins the term "Thucydides Trap" to capture the danger of power
transition.5 The high probability of war apparently prompted Chinese
President Xi Jinping to publicly deny the existence of the Thucydides
Trap during his visit to the United States in 2015: "There is no such
thing as the so-called Thucydides trap in the world. But should major
countries time and again make the mistakes of strategic miscalculation,
they might create such traps for themselves."6 [Avoiding a potential
US-China war has become one of the most important issues for
policymakers as well as academic communities. Accommodation emerges as a
war-avoidance strategy during power transition]{.underline}. T.V. Paul
defines accommodation as "mutual adaptation and acceptance by
established and rising powers, and the elimination or substantial
reduction of hostility between them."7 The term "[accommodation" is a
variant of the disgraced strategy of appeasement]{.underline}. Given the
emotional baggage of appeasement, most analysts choose to use the term
"accommodation" instead. Culling through various definitions, Norrin M.
Ripsman and Jack S. Levy summarize that appeasement is "conventionally
defined as the satisfaction of grievances through unilateral
concessions, with the aim of avoiding war."8 Charles Glaser defines
accommodation synonymously with appeasement: "unilateral territorial
concessions to an adversary designed to reduce the probability of war."9
Like appeasement, [the strategy of accommodation attempts to reduce the
probability of war by making unilateral concessions to a dissatisfied
adversary in hopes of turning it into a status quo power]{.underline}.
Proponents of accommodating China on Taiwan offer three arguments.
First, Taiwan is the most dangerous issue in US-China relations and the
main source of potential conflict. Removing it would pave the way for
better bilateral relations. In the words of Chas Freeman: "The Taiwan
issue is the only one with the potential to ignite a war between China
and the United States.... The kind of long-term relationship of
friendship and cooperation China and America want with each other is
incompatible with our emotionally fraught differences over the Taiwan
issue. These differences propel mutual hostility and the sort of ruinous
military rivalry between the two countries that has already begun."10
Similarly, Charles Glaser writes, "the United States should consider
backing away from its commitment to Taiwan. This would remove the most
obvious and contentious flash point between the United States and China
and smooth the way for better relations between them in the decades to
come."11 Forsaking Taiwan, so the thinking goes, defuses the most
explosive issue in US-China relations and prevents a future conflict.
Second, accommodationists argue that abandoning Taiwan could moderate
the security dilemma between the United States and China. Military
competition is already intensifying. China is expanding anti-access area
denial (A2/AD) capabilities (which the Chinese military refers to as
"counter-intervention," fan jieru) to thwart US intervention in the
Taiwan Strait, while the United States is developing its AirSea Battle
concept to counter China. Charles Glaser writes, "A decision by the
United States to end its commitment to Taiwan could moderate this
security Y.-K. WANG 249 dilemma...."12 Similarly, Bruce Gilley argues
that ending the US security commitment would "allow Taiwan to break this
cycle by taking itself out of the game and moderating the security
dilemma that haunts the Washington-Beijing relationship."13 In this
view, abandoning Taiwan enables trust-building and facilitates
cooperation between the United States and China. Third,
accommodationists claim that China has limited aims in its foreign
policy. "From the United States' perspective," writes Charles Glaser,
"there is broad agreement on Taiwan---China's goal of unification makes
China a limited-aims expansionist state."14 Chas W. Freeman, Jr., avers
that "China does not...have a history of global power projection, seek
to export an ideology, or propose to expand beyond its traditional
frontiers."15 In this view, China's security objective is defense of the
homeland, not expansionism. China does not seek regional hegemony, nor
does it wish to push the United States out of Asia. If China has no
desire beyond Taiwan, abandoning Taiwan would not risk creating a more
dangerous China. Once this key source of bilateral tension is removed,
both Beijing and Washington could then proceed to build a more
cooperative relationship. Bruce Gilley goes even further: "Beijing has
no interest in occupying or ruling Taiwan; it simply wants a sphere of
influence that increases its global clout and in which Taiwan is a
neutral state, not a client state."16 Since China is motivated by the
limited aims of defending the mainland, Gilley proposes that Washington
should stop antagonizing China and end its security commitment to
Taiwan, letting the island become a Finlandized neutral state. Taken
together, [accommodationists believe that by making unilateral
concessions on Taiwan, the United States would remove the principal
source of conflict and disagreement with China, thereby satisfying
China's grievances, reducing bilateral tensions, and potentially
avoiding]{.underline} [war]{.underline}. Although most accommodationists
do not explicitly ground their argument in international relations
theory, [their proposal parallels defensive realism]{.underline}.17
Defensive realism takes an optimistic view about the effects of anarchy,
arguing that the structure of the international system is generally
benign and does not always lead to competitive policies. In the
offensedefense balance, military technology and geography often favor
the defense. Security is thus plentiful.18 The best means for states to
be secure is to maintain the status quo. States should not attempt to
maximize relative power because it would trigger counterbalancing.
Defensive realists argue that states can convey reliable information
about their motives through costly signaling and policy choices. Both
China and the United RETHINKING US SECURITY COMMITMENT TO TAIWAN 250
States are secure because they enjoy "defensive advantage" created by
nuclear weapons and geographical separation. As Glaser argues, "China's
rise need not be nearly as competitive and dangerous...because the
structural forces driving major powers into conflict will be relatively
weak."19 The dangers come from secondary disputes such as Taiwan. A US
accommodation on Taiwan would indicate US benign motives toward China.
If China reciprocates, such as on the South China Sea or other issues,
it would convey information about the limited extent of China's foreign
policy aims. China could thus rise peacefully, a view that is in stark
contrast to offensive realism.20 As a theory, defensive realism is an
intellectual cousin of idealism. It describes how the world should work
instead of how the world actually works. As Glaser makes clear,
defensive realism "analyzes the strategies a state should choose"
(emphasis original) to achieve their goals and as such, "it is a
prescriptive, normative theory."21 The problem with normative theory
such as defensive realism is that it does not have much explanatory
power, as John Mearsheimer points out.22 [The historical record is often
at odds with defensive realism, with great powers having behaved in ways
that contradict the theory]{.underline}. Defensive realism often
attempts to explain away these anomalies by incorporating non-structural
variables such as domestic politics or misperception into their
theory.23 Like idealism, [the policy prescriptions of defensive realism
may appear desirable, but they are politically
infeasible.]{.underline}24 Their proposals provide little guidance to
realistic policy making. In this article, I draw on offensive realism to
highlight the dangers of accommodating China on Taiwan.25 Unlike
defensive realism, offensive realism argues that the structure of the
international system drives states to compete for power. To be secure,
major states will maximize relative power until they have dominated the
system. Great powers seek to establish hegemony in their region, while
preventing rival powers from dominating another region. The
offense-defense balance emphasized by defensive realism offers little
guidance to international politics because it is inherently difficult
both to distinguish defense from offense and to operationalize the
concept.26 States cannot reliably convey their motives or intentions to
others. The intentions of states are difficult to know, and even if
known, present intentions can still change in the future.27 Because
states face uncertainty about the intentions of others under anarchy,
the security dilemma cannot be moderated[.]{.underline} As Mearsheimer
points out, "little Y.-K. WANG 251 can be done to ameliorate the
security dilemma as long as states operate in anarchy."28 Adopting
offensive realism as the theoretical baseline reveals the flaws of
accommodationist arguments favored by defensive realists.

[A [Chinese aircraft carrier group was passing through the strategically

the authorities in Taipei. The Liaoning, along with its five escorts,
entered the highly sensitive waters from the South China Sea, heading
towards its home port of Qingdao in eastern China, the Taiwanese defence

warships also conducted what they classified as a "freedom of

latest voyage began earlier this month, when the ships sailed through
Japan's Miyako Strait, then passed the US territory of Guam and the
Philippines before entering the disputed South China Sea. On Monday it
passed by the Taiwanese-controlled Patras Islands before entering the
Taiwan Strait on Tuesday morning. The carrier was making its first ocean
voyage since leaving the dock after maintenance in February, and its
accompanied by two guided missile destroyers, the Shijiazhuang and

[The key for the United States, then, is lowering the chances of China
believing it can impose reunification by force]{.underline}. Since the
1970s, U.S. policy toward Taiwan has been based on a deliberate
strategic ambiguity as part of the so-called One China policy.

not treat Taiwan as a sovereign, independent nation. It
[[indicated]{.mark} that [it would oppose]{.mark} a [Chinese invasion of

### 2NC -- AT: Ending Arms Sales 🡪 Peace -- Chinese Aggression

#### Ending arms sales doesn't cause peace

The [revisionists suggest]{.underline} that [the U.S.]{.underline}
government [should satisfy the]{.underline} ''wants'' of the
[CCP]{.underline} regime [by stopping selling arms to
Taiwan]{.underline}: ''Strides forward in the U.S./China relationship
can be accelerated by a fresh look at solving the Taiwan issue.'' [No
specifics are offered on what China would give in return that would
enhance]{.underline} the likelihood of [peace in the
region]{.underline}. Where would China be more conciliatory? Wouldn't [a
U.S. accommodation]{.underline} of China's demands on Taiwan rather
[make it more likely that others in the region]{.underline}, especially
governments seeking U.S. support to help preserve their sovereignty,
would [deem Washington unreliable]{.underline}? Wouldn't [that
facilitate Beijing's regional hegemony]{.underline}? How would such an
outcome be helpful to the goals of America's Grand Strategy?
[The]{.underline} actual [consequences of abandoning Taiwan
would]{.underline} therefore be to [advance]{.underline} authoritarian
[China's regional domination to the detriment of]{.underline} virtually
[all others in the region]{.underline}, an outcome that would not
advance American interests. Yet the [revisionists]{.underline}, of
course, are realists. They [worry about war]{.underline} because they
find war-prone forces in China. Reports out of China portray President
Hu Jintao, who left office at the end of 2012, as long being under
attack as weak and indecisive in Asia, even as China was becoming more
expansionist and assertive against its neighbors. This tendency grew,
even though China Taiwan relations were tranquil. It does not bode well
for China's neighbors.16 It suggests that [the dangers of
war]{.underline} in Asia [are not]{.underline} significantly [related to
Taiwan's arms purchases from America]{.underline}. That is, [there is no
reason to believe]{.underline} the core contention of the revisionists:
[that ending arms sales to Taiwan will preserve the peace]{.underline}

### No independence Movement -- Pressure from China

#### PRC pressure makes Taiwanese pushes for independence impossible - the threat of intervention shuts down any reactionary forces

[President Xi Jinping **ratcheted up the pressure** on Taiwan's
pro-self-rule government on Wednesday, asserting China's right to use
military force against "foreign powers" that **intervene on the issue of
independence** for the country. Mr. Xi said Taiwan "**must be unified,
will be unified**" with China]{.underline} in a sharp rebuke to
President Tsai Ing-wen, who this week said [that her people wanted to
maintain self-rule and has courted closer ties with the US. "Chinese
people do not fight other Chinese]{.underline}," Mr. Xi said, but added
that [Beijing would take "**necessary measures**" against foreign
interference and "a small number of Taiwanese independence activists and
separatist activities]{.underline}". Mr. Xi's speech is the latest in a
series of [**aggressive** signals towards Taiwan and the US over the
past year]{.underline}, amid concerns in Beijing about warming relations
between Taipei and Washington. Ms. Tsai on Tuesday used a new year's
address to call China's attempts to "interfere in Taiwan's internal
politics" her "greatest challenge". Her remarks came a day after [US
President Donald Trump signed the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, a new
law that promotes US arms sales and high-level visits to
Taiwan.]{.underline} Mr Xi's speech marked 40 years since Beijing ended
the military bombardment of Taiwanese-controlled islands off the
mainland to instead focus on diplomacy. The two sides have been at
loggerheads since the Communist party took power in China nearly 70
years ago and the former ruling Kuomintang party fled to Taiwan. [China
claims Taiwan is its territory]{.underline}. A senior Taiwanese official
said [Mr. Xi's warning over foreign interference was clearly
"**targeting the US**" but played down concerns that Washington would
weaken its support. "I really do not worry that someday the United
States is going to abandon Taiwan]{.underline}," the official said. Ms.
Tsai responded to Mr. Xi's comments by saying Taiwan would never accept
"one country, two systems". "[China has to face the fact that the
Republic of China \[Taiwan\] exists]{.underline}," she said. Analysts
say that with the power to rule China for life, [Mr. Xi could be
considering making the eventual unification of China and Taiwan a
hallmark of his presidency with a more **nationalist
approach**]{.underline}. Zhu Feng, head of Nanjing University's school
of international relations, said the promise not to use military power
against "Chinese people" to force unification could be seen as "an
important development in Taiwan relations" but [it still left an opening
for **military retaliation** against perceived moves towards
independence.]{.underline} Recommended The Big Read China's 'sharp
power' play in Taiwan Since Ms. Tsai's pro-independence Democratic
Progressive party (DPP) won Taiwan's presidency in 2016, [**Beijing has
hardened its stance**, conducting live-fire naval **military exercises**
in the Taiwan Strait last year for the first time since
2015]{.underline}. In September, [China criticised the US for approving
a \$330m arms sale to Taiwan]{.underline}, the second such weapons
agreement with Taiwan since Donald Trump took office. [Beijing has also
**ramped up pressure** on civilian fronts, encouraging international
airlines and hotels into referring to Taiwan as part of China. China
will "**leave no room for any form of Taiwanese independence
movement**]{.underline}", Mr. Xi said. "The Taiwan problem is a Chinese
domestic issue . . . we cannot allow any foreign interference."

### Ending Arms Sales Kills Reconciliation 

#### Ending Security Ties with Taiwan makes the US look like a Puppet---T/Case

**Chen et al. 17** (Chen, Ping-Kuei, et al. "A Farewell to Arms?: US
Security Relations with Taiwan and the Prospects for Stability in the
Taiwan Strait." *Taiwan and China: Fitful Embrace*, edited by Lowell
Dittmer, 1st ed., University of California Press, Oakland, California,

[www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1w76wpm.15](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1w76wpm.15).)

Proposals to scale back US security ties to Taiwan are controversial,
however, and several scholars have written thoughtful critiques of the
idea. These critiques have generally made a few key points. First, **[it
is not self-evident that ending security ties with Taiwan would in fact
transform the US-China relationship]{.underline}**: the **[interests of
the two countries arguably clash on many other issues (North Korea,
maritime disputes in East Asia, economic issues]{.underline}**), and it
is unclear why Beijing would yield on these other issues if only the
United States were to adopt a policy on arms sales that---from Beijing's
vantage---the United States had already committed to follow in the 1982
joint communiqué. **[Second, the United States' reputation in the region
could be at stake]{.underline}**. Some worry that **[walking away from a
commitment to Taiwan would send a troubling signal to other US allies in
East Asia]{.underline}**. **[Beijing might likewise view US concessions
on Taiwan as a sign of weakness and conclude that Washington was
unlikely to challenge the PRC on other issues in the
region]{.underline}.** Third, **[ending arms sales---because it would
add to Taiwan's sense of insecurity---could actually make Taipei more
hesitant about entering into sensitive political talks with the
PRC]{.underline}**; thus it isn't clear that a reduced US commitment to
Taiwan would facilitate a peaceful resolution to the dispute. Finally,
and relatedly, **[ending arms sales would likely undercut Taiwan's
deterrent capabilities, which in turn could encourage a more coercive
PRC approach to the island]{.underline}**.10

### US-Taiwan Relations Unstable

#### The aff oversimplifies the relationship -- broader unpredictability under the Trump administration means they cant solve tensions at the Taiwan Strait

**DeLisle 18**

**(Jacques deLisle, August 2018, Stephen A. Cozen Professor of Law &
Professor of Political Science; Director, Center for East Asian Studies,
"United States-Taiwan Relations: Tsai's Presidency and Washington's
Policy", "China Review", AD)**

A similar pattern characterized moves in security relations. [The Trump
administration in June 2017 gave notice that it would be moving forward
with a significant arms sales to Taiwan, consistent with the Taiwan
Relations Act. The announcement followed a statement by Defense
Secretary Mattis, at the Shangri-La Dialogue, that made specific, if
brief, reference to Taiwan, reiterating the U.S. commitment to "working
with Taiwan," providing TRA-mandated defense articles, and "stand\[ing\]
for the peaceful resolution of any issues in a manner acceptable to
people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait." Congress passed, and Trump
signed, the National Defense Authorization Act, which called on the
president to allow for reciprocal ports of call by U.S. and Taiwan
navies.]{.underline} A senior visiting U.S. official in Taipei assured
Tsai at a public forum that the U.S. "commitment" to "bolster Taiwan's
ability to defend its democracy" had "never been stronger." Secretary of
State Mike Pompeo affirmed support for arms sales during his
confirmation hearings. At the 2018 Shangri-La Dialogue, Mattis echoed
and extended his remarks from a year earlier, saying that the
U.S."remains steadfastly committed to working with adopted remarkably
harsh rhetoric threatening an especially tough posture toward China. But
the implications for Taiwan policy were unclear when Trump came to
office and remained so. A U.S. presidential campaign's critical stance
toward China---and criticism of its predecessor for being too soft on
China---has sometimes foreshadowed enhanced support for Taiwan in a new
administration. This occurred, for example, in the Reagan and second
Bush administrations, and arguably the Clinton administration as well.
(In the case of Clinton, a longer time lag and several intervening
developments occurred between the U.S. election and the uptick in U.S.
support for Taiwan.) But this has not always been the case, and any such
"pro-Taiwan" effect often has been fleeting[. And, for Trump, the link
between words and deeds has been especially weak. The Trump
administration's approach to East Asian security issues has been
variable and contradictory, increasing uncertainty on many fronts
including Taiwan policy. By embracing an "America First" foreign policy,
casting doubt on the stability of traditional U.S. security commitments
in East Asia, and suggesting that even core U.S. allies such as Japan
and Korea might have to fend for themselves, Trump adumbrated an
approach that could imply significant erosion---or, at best, greatly
increased uncertainty---in the U.S.'s security commitment to
Taiwan.]{.underline} On the other hand, senior officials in the early
days of the Trump administration began to make trips to East Asia, in
large part to reassure allies about the reliability of U.S. security
commitments in the region. Taiwan to provide the necessary defense
articles and service ....\[and\] oppose\[s\] all unilateral efforts to
alter the status quo...." Former Secretary of Defense Ash Carter and the
incumbent Assistant Secretary for East Asia both characterized Taiwan as
holding a significant place in the Trump administration's Indo-Pacific
security strategy. [In July 2018, the U.S. took the unusual---and
Beijing-angering---step of sending warships into the Taiwan
Strait.]{.underline} Personnel decisions similarly suggested a cluster
of pro-Taiwan and pro--status quo moves in U.S.-Taiwan relations. After
months of indecision and speculation, a career official and widely
regarded symbol of policy continuity, Susan Thornton, was nominated as
Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs a post
she had been filling for months on an acting basis, although this signal
was muddied when her appointment did not go forward following
Tillerson's departure.68 Nearly a year into Trump's presidency, an
experienced official widely regarded as a friend of Taiwan, Randall
Schriver, was named to be an Assistant Secretary of Defense. [A few
months later, the most senior Trump administration official associated
with statements that raised concerns of waning support for Taiwan,
Secretary of State Tillerson, was summarily fired, and replaced by Mike
Pompeo, who was generally perceived as tougher on China and friendlier
to Taiwan.]{.underline} One of the advisors who was rumored to have
supported the Tsai-Trump phone call and who appeared to have few qualms
about taking positions that offend Beijing, John Bolton, was named as
National Security Advisor, replacing the more circumspect H. R.
McMaster[. The broader policy contexts that matter especially much for
U.S.- Taiwan relations have been unstable under Trump and sent ambiguous
signals about Taiwan and U.S.-Taiwan relations.]{.underline}

### AT Escalation -- US Wont Intervene

#### No escalation -- US wont intervene

Washington analysts continue to see an attempted People's Liberation
Army (PLA) invasion of Taiwan as prohibitively risky for China, but the
threat is real and must be taken seriously. The question is, [will the
US go to war with China for Taiwan, and consequently face catastrophic
consequences? The answer is no. It is easier to use allies to duel it
out.]{.underline} These actions are on display globally as you see many
countries are being drawn into the US effort to contain China's growing
influence. And they are taking some hard knocks for it. [The US is
trying to figure out how to safeguard its interests in the Indo-Pacific
against Chinese hegemony. Taiwan is a small player in this expansive
game, and therefore a very convenient card to play. With China's power
increasing by the day, Taiwan is ultimately better off reaching a
political rapprochement with China instead of relying on the US being
ready to defend it.]{.underline}

### AT Escalation -- Taiwan Wins the War

#### Taiwan wins a war against china

**Greer 18**

(Tanner Greer, writer and analyst formerly based out of Beijing whose
research focuses on the evolution of East Asian strategic thought from
the time of Sunzi to today, "Taiwan Can Win a War With China", 9/25/18,
accessed 5/26/19
https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/09/25/taiwan-can-win-a-war-with-china/)//AM

When Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke to the 19th Party Congress about
the future of Taiwan last year, his message was ominous and unequivocal:
"We have firm will, full confidence, and sufficient capability to defeat
any form of Taiwan independence secession plot. We will never allow any
person, any organization, or any political party to split any part of
the Chinese territory from China at any time or in any form." This
remark drew the longest applause of his entire three-hour speech---but
it's not a new message. The invincibility of Chinese arms in the face of
Taiwanese "separatists" and the inevitability of reunification are
constant Chinese Communist Party themes. At its base, the threat made by
Xi is that the People's Liberation Army has the power to defeat the
Taiwanese military and destroy its democracy by force, if need be. Xi
understands the consequences of failure here. "We have the
determination, the ability and the preparedness to deal with Taiwanese
independence," he stated in 2016, "and if we do not deal with it, we
will be overthrown." China has already ratcheted up economic and
diplomatic pressure on the island since the 2016 election of Tsai
Ing-wen and the independence-friendly Democratic Progressive Party.
[Saber-rattling around the Taiwan Strait has been common.]{.underline}
But [China might not be able to deliver on its repeated
threats.]{.underline} Despite the vast discrepancy in size between the
two countries, there's a real possibility that [Taiwan could fight off a
Chinese attack]{.underline}---**[even without direct aid from the United
States]{.underline}**. [Two recent studies, one by Michael Beckley, a
political scientist at Tufts University, and the other by Ian Easton, a
fellow at the Project 2049 Institute,]{.underline} in his book The
Chinese Invasion Threat: Taiwan's Defense and American Strategy in Asia,
provide us with a clearer picture of what a war between Taiwan and the
mainland might look like. **[Grounded in statistics, training manuals,
and planning documents from the PLA itself]{.underline}**, **[and
informed by simulations and studies conducted by both the U.S. Defense
Department and the Taiwanese Ministry of National
Defense]{.underline}**, this research presents a very different picture
of a cross-strait conflict than that hawked by the party's official
announcements. Chinese commanders fear they may be forced into armed
contest with an enemy that is better trained, better motivated, and
better prepared for the rigors of warfare than troops the PLA could
throw against them. [**Chinese army documents** imagine that this gamble
will begin with missiles]{.underline}. For months, the PLA's Rocket
Force will have been preparing this opening salvo; from the second war
begins until the day the invasion commences, these missiles will scream
toward the Taiwanese coast, with airfields, communication hubs, radar
equipment, transportation nodes, and government offices in their sights.
Concurrently, [party sleeper agents]{.underline} or special forces
discreetly ferried across the strait [will begin an assassination
campaign targeting the president and her Cabinet]{.underline}, other
leaders of the Democratic Progressive Party, officials at key
bureaucracies, prominent media personalities, important scientists or
engineers, and their families. [The goal]{.underline} of all this
[is]{.underline} twofold. In the narrower tactical sense, the PLA hopes
[to destroy as much of the Taiwanese Air Force]{.underline} on the
ground [as it can]{.underline} [and]{.underline} from that point forward
[keep things chaotic enough on the ground that the Taiwan's Air Force
cannot sortie fast]{.underline} [enough]{.underline} to challenge
China's control of the air. [The missile campaign's second aim
is]{.underline} simpler: paralysis. With the [president dead, leadership
mute, communications down, and transportation impossible]{.underline},
the Taiwanese forces will be left rudderless, demoralized, and
disoriented. This "shock and awe" campaign will pave the way for the
invasion proper. This invasion will be the largest amphibious operation
in human history. Tens of thousands of vessels will be
assembled---mostly commandeered from the Chinese merchant marine---to
ferry 1 million Chinese troops across the strait, who will arrive in two
waves. Their landing will be preceded by a fury of missiles and rockets,
launched from the Rocket Force units in Fujian, Chinese Air Force
fighter bombers flying in the strait, and the escort fleet itself.
Confused, cut off, and overwhelmed, the Taiwanese forces who have
survived thus far will soon run out of supplies and be forced to abandon
the beaches. Once the beachhead is secured, the process will begin
again: With full air superiority, the PLA will have the pick of their
targets, Taiwanese command and control will be destroyed, and isolated
Taiwanese units will be swept aside by the Chinese army's advance.
Within a week, they will have marched into Taipei; within two weeks they
will have implemented a draconian martial law intended to convert the
island into the pliant forward operating base the PLA will need to
defend against the anticipated Japanese and American counter-campaigns.
This is the best-case scenario for the PLA. But an island docile and
defeated two weeks after D-Day is not a guaranteed outcome. One of the
central hurdles facing the offensive is surprise. The PLA simply will
not have it. **[The invasion will happen in April or
October]{.underline}**. Because of the challenges posed by the strait's
weather, a transport fleet can only make it across the strait in one of
these two four-week windows. The scale of the invasion will be so large
that strategic surprise will not be possible, especially given the
extensive mutual penetration of each side by the other's intelligence
agencies. Easton estimates that **[Taiwanese, American, and Japanese
leaders will know that the PLA is preparing for a cross-strait war more
than 60 days before hostilities begin]{.underline}**. [They will know
for certain that an invasion will happen more than 30 days before the
first missiles are fired]{.underline}. [This will give]{.underline} the
[Taiwan]{.underline}ese [ample time]{.underline} [to move much of their
command and control infrastructure into hardened mountain tunnels, move
their fleet out of vulnerable ports, detain suspected agents and
intelligence operatives]{.underline}, [litter the ocean with sea mines,
disperse and camouflage army units across the country, put the economy
on war footing, and distribute weapons]{.underline} to Taiwan's 2.5
million reservists. [There are only 13 beaches]{.underline} on Taiwan's
western coast that [the PLA could]{.underline} possibly [land
at]{.underline}. [Each]{.underline} of these [has already been
prepared]{.underline} for a potential conflict. Long underground
tunnels---complete with hardened, subterranean supply
depots---crisscross the landing sites. The berm of each beach has been
covered with razor-leaf plants. Chemical treatment plants are common in
many beach towns---meaning that invaders must prepare for the clouds of
toxic gas any indiscriminate saturation bombing on their part will
release. This is how things stand in times of peace. As war approaches,
each beach will be turned into a workshop of horrors. The path from
these beaches to the capital has been painstakingly mapped; once a state
of emergency has been declared, [each step of the journey will be
complicated or booby-trapped]{.underline}. PLA war manuals warn soldiers
that [skyscrapers and rock outcrops will have steel cords strung between
them to entangle helicopters]{.underline}; tunnels, bridges, and
overpasses will be rigged with munitions (to be destroyed only at the
last possible moment); and building after building in Taiwan's dense
urban core will be transformed into small redoubts meant to drag Chinese
units into drawn-out fights over each city street. To understand the
real strength of these defenses, imagine them as a PLA grunt would
experience them. Like most privates, he is a countryside boy from a poor
province. He has been told his entire life that Taiwan has been totally
and fatally eclipsed by Chinese power. He will be eager to put the
separatists in their place. Yet events will not work out as he has
imagined. In the weeks leading up to war, he discovers that his older
cousin---whose remittances support their grandparents in the Anhui
countryside---has lost her job in Shanghai. All wire money transfers
from Taipei have stopped, and the millions of Chinese who are employed
by Taiwanese companies have had their pay suspended. Our private
celebrates the opening of hostilities in Shanwei, where he is rushed
through a three-week training course on fighting in the fetid and
unfamiliar jungles of China's south. By now, the PLA has put him in a
media blackout, but still rumors creep in: Yesterday it was whispered
that the 10-hour delay in their train schedule had nothing to do with an
overwhelmed transportation system and everything to do with Taiwanese
saboteurs. Today's whispers report that the commander of the 1st Marine
Brigade in Zhanjiang was assassinated. Tomorrow, men will wonder if
rolling power outages really are just an attempt to save power for the
war effort. But by the time he reaches the staging area in Fuzhou, the
myth of China's invincibility has been shattered by more than rumors.
The gray ruins of Fuzhou's PLA offices are his first introduction to the
terror of missile attack. Perhaps he takes comfort in the fact that the
salvos coming from Taiwan do not seem to match the number of salvos
streaking toward it---but abstractions like this can only do so much to
shore up broken nerves, and he doesn't have the time to acclimate
himself to the shock. Blast by terrifying blast, his confidence that the
Chinese army can keep him safe is chipped away. The last, most terrible
salvo comes as he embarks---he is one of the lucky few setting foot on a
proper amphibious assault boat, not a civilian vessel converted to war
use in the eleventh hour---but this is only the first of many horrors on
the waters. Some transports are sunk by Taiwanese torpedoes, released by
submarines held in reserve for this day. Airborne Harpoon missiles,
fired by F-16s leaving the safety of cavernous, nuclear-proof mountain
bunkers for the first time in the war, will destroy others. [The
greatest casualties]{.underline}, however, [will be caused by sea
mines]{.underline}. [Minefield after minefield must be
crossed]{.underline} by every ship in the flotilla, some a harrowing
eight miles in width. Seasick thanks to the strait's rough waves, our
grunt can do nothing but pray his ship safely makes it across. As he
approaches land, the psychological pressure increases. The first
**[craft]{.underline}** to cross the shore **[will be
met]{.underline}**, as Easton's research shows, **[with a sudden wall of
flame]{.underline}** [springing up from the water from the miles of
oil-filled pipeline sunk underneath]{.underline}. As his ship makes it
through the fire (he is lucky; others around it are speared or entangled
on sea traps) he faces what Easton describes as [a mile's worth of
"razor wire nets, hook boards, skin-peeling planks, barbed wire fences,
wire obstacles, spike strips, landmines, anti-tank barrier walls,
anti-tank obstacles]{.underline} ... [bamboo spikes, felled trees, truck
shipping containers, and junkyard cars]{.underline}." At this stage, his
safety depends largely on whether [the Chinese Air Force has been able
to able to distinguish between real artillery pieces from the hundreds
of decoy targets]{.underline} and dummy equipment PLA manuals believe
the Taiwanese Army has created. [The odds are against]{.underline} him:
As Beckley notes in a study published last fall, in the 1990 to 1991
Gulf War, the [88,500 tons of ordnance dropped by the U.S.-led coalition
did not destroy a single Iraqi road-mobile missile
launcher]{.underline}. [NATO's 78-day campaign aimed at Serbian air
defenses only managed to destroy three of Serbia's 22 mobile-missile
batteries]{.underline}. **[There is no reason to think that the Chinese
Air Force will have a higher success rate when targeting Taiwan's mobile
artillery and missile defense]{.underline}**. But if our grunt survives
the initial barrages on the beach, he still must fight his way through
the main Taiwanese Army groups, 2[.5 million armed reservists dispersed
in]{.underline} the [dense cities and jungles]{.underline} of Taiwan,
and [miles of mines, booby traps, and debris]{.underline}. [This is an
enormous thing to ask of a private who has no personal experience with
war]{.underline}. It is an even great thing to ask it of a private who
naively believed in his own army's invincibility. This sketch makes
sense of the anxiety the PLA officer manuals express. **[They know war
would be a terrific gamble]{.underline}**, even if they only admit it to
each other. Yet it [this also makes sense of the party's violent
reactions to even the smallest of arms sales to Taiwan]{.underline}.
Their passion betrays their angst. They understand what Western
gloom-and-doomsters do not. American analysts use terms like "[mature
precision-strike regime]{.underline}" and "[anti-access and area denial
warfare]{.underline}" to describe **[tech]{.underline}**nological trends
that **[make it extremely difficult to project naval and airpower near
enemy shores]{.underline}**. **[Costs favor the defense:]{.underline}**
[It is much cheaper to build a ship-killing missile than it is to build
a ship]{.underline}. But if this means that the Chinese army can counter
U.S. force projection at a fraction of America's costs, it also means
that the [democracies straddling the East Asian rim can deter Chinese
aggression at a fraction of the PLA's costs]{.underline}. In an era that
favors defense, **[small nations like Taiwan do not need a PLA-sized
military budget to keep the Chinese at bay]{.underline}**. No one needs
to hear this message more than the Taiwanese themselves. In my trips to
Taiwan, I have made a point of tracking down and interviewing both
conscripts and career soldiers. Their pessimism is palpable. This morale
crisis in the ranks partly reflects the severe mismanagement of the
conscription system, which has left even eager Taiwanese patriots
disillusioned with their military experience. But just as important is
the lack of knowledge ordinary Taiwanese have about the strength of
their islands' defenses. A recent poll found that 65 percent of
Taiwanese "have no confidence" in their military's ability to hold off
the PLA. Absent a vigorous campaign designed to educate the public about
the true odds of successful military resistance, the Taiwanese people
are likely to judge the security of their island on flawed metrics, like
the diminishing number of countries that maintain formal relations with
Taipei instead of Beijing. The PLA's projected campaign is specifically
designed to overwhelm and overawe a demoralized Taiwanese military. The
most crucial battlefield may be the minds of the Taiwanese themselves.
Defeatism is a more dangerous threat to Taiwanese democracy than any
weapon in China's armory. Both Westerners and Taiwanese should be more
optimistic about the defense of Taiwan than is now normal. Yes, **[the
Taiwanese Army projects that it can only hold off its enemy for two
weeks]{.underline}** after the landing---but **[the PLA]{.underline}**
also **[believes that if it cannot defeat the Taiwanese forces in under
two weeks]{.underline}**, **[it will lose]{.underline}** the war! Yes,
the disparity between the military budgets on both sides of the strait
is large, and growing---but the Taiwanese do not need parity to deter
Chinese aggression. A**[ll they need is the freedom to purchase the sort
of arms that make invasion unthinkable.]{.underline}** **[If that
political battle can be resolved]{.underline}** in the halls of
Washington, **[the party will not have the power to threaten battle on
the shores of Taiwan]{.underline}**.

The problem for China is that these methods still rely on the Taipei
government choosing to surrender. Historically, governments and
societies under attack become more defiant rather than submissive.
Judging from the reaction of Taiwan's people to Japanese colonisation
beginning in 1895 and to the imposition of Kuomintang rule beginning in
1945, Taiwan would not be an exception. For US and China, the real
friction over Taiwan is yet to come. The only sure way to compel
Taiwan's surrender would be for PLA soldiers to occupy Taiwan's major
cities. **[But even as China's military capabilities improve, the
chances of success in an all-out invasion of Taiwan are low -- even if
the United States did not intervene on Taiwan's behalf]{.underline}**.
[China would need to ferry its troops, most of them packed into
slow-moving and highly visible ships, across the 160km wide Taiwan
Strait, where they would be highly vulnerable to attack]{.underline},
and then unload them and huge amounts of ammunition and other supplies
while trudging through sand or mud and under heavy fire. [China has the
capacity to transport only a few tens of thousands of troops at a time.
Much of this force would not make it across the strait]{.underline}.
[Awaiting the survivors would be 180,000 active duty Taiwanese soldiers
plus 1.5 million reservists]{.underline}. [If the United States chose to
intervene, US aircraft from bases in the region could begin flying
missions within hours]{.underline}. China might try to impede this by
firing missiles to temporarily knock out runways used by US aircraft,
but this would reduce the number of missiles available to hit Taiwan,
and also bring Japan's military forces fully into a war. Even if it won
the military campaign, [Beijing would face the daunting prospect of
trying to rule a society that was accustomed to democratic governance
and would be inveterately hostile towards]{.underline} China for
generations to come. Tibet would appear quiescent by comparison.

But would Trump use military force to defend Taiwan? [Even without
large-scale U.S. involvement, China might not be able to conquer Taiwan
outright]{.underline}. [Conventional military invasions across bodies of
water are extremely difficult. And time would not be on Beijing's side
since any invasion would be disruptive, even catastrophic, for both the
global economy and China]{.underline}, which depends on exports of
manufactured goods and imports of energy and raw materials to sustain
its economy.

### Europe fill in 

#### Even with US sales, Europe is already invested

However, [Beijing does not just have the US to worry about. Taiwanese
media reported on September 26 about two contracts with France on
training and upgrades to nearly 50 French-made Mirage 2000 high-altitude
fighter jets in Taiwan's air force inventory.]{.underline} Three loud
and clear messages from Taiwan's military exercise Moreover, [Taiwan's
defence ministry decided on a European design for Taiwan's Indigenous
Defence Submarine project]{.underline}. The media has speculated that
French shipbuilder Direction des Constructions Navales Services and
German Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft were among the contenders, and one
of them is likely to be the winner. [The French connection to Taiwan's
defence modernisation is a timely reminder that European defence
industry companies are present and active in Taiwan]{.underline}. [With
France and Germany leading European resistance against adverse effects
of the Belt and Road Initiative, and greater scrutiny over Chinese
investment in and acquisition of strategic industries, Europe's arms
suppliers may find the situation ripe for taking a greater share in
Taiwan's defence projects. Their governments may very well give them the
green light]{.underline}. It is too early to say if the latest arms sale
to Taiwan will deliver on its promise of normalising the process of arms
sales and (to the extent possible) depoliticising decisions on arms
sales by removing undue deference to Beijing's perceptions.

This year marks the fortieth anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act
(TRA), one of the most important components of U.S. policy toward
Taiwan. In addition to President Ronald Reagan's 1982 Six Assurances[,
the TRA forms the cornerstone of the U.S.-Taiwan relationship, providing
unequivocal guidance for relations between both allies. Moreover,
**Taiwan is a U.S. ally** whose progress has been an inspiration to all
those still suffering under repressive governments. Taiwan's vibrant
democracy, open society, and free market are examples to the world of
what can be achieved when innovation and human rights are allowed to
flourish.]{.underline} For forty years, [the TRA has provided a vehicle
for peace in the Pacific and a means of maintaining a direct
relationship between Washington with the more than twenty-three million
Taiwanese people who are one of America's most important allies and
trading partners. This legislation provides an institutional framework
and legal basis for **continued U.S. relations with Taiwan after the end
of formal diplomatic ties.** Enabled by the TRA, continuity in U.S.
policy has preserved American credibility within the Asia-Pacific region
and enabled the island's nascent democracy to flourish. U.S. support for
Taiwan has also served as a visible symbol of U.S. commitment to peace
and security in the Asia-Pacific region.]{.underline} Moreover, helping
Taiwan make further meaningful contributions in the Asia-Pacific region
is in the interest of the United States and in line with the spirit of
the TRA. [**Taiwan was---and continues to be---one of America's most
reliable allies**. Furthermore, Taiwan now ranks as one of America's
**leading trade partners**. However, there are several areas where the
United States should seek to strengthen ties with Taiwan and to bring
into reality the legislative intent of the Taiwan Relations
Act.]{.underline} Chinese president Xi Jinping has said that he would
not renounce the use of force to achieve unification with Taiwan and
China has been building military outposts in the South China Sea. In
light of the Chinese threat against Taiwan, the United States needs to
stand up for what the TRA says and make it very clear that its
relationship with Taiwan is an important one. 1. Given the increasing
threat that China poses to Taiwan and to regional stability, it is in
the interest of the United States to strengthen Taiwan's defense
capabilities against China. [The best way to defend the democratic
island from an unprovoked attack is for **Washington to provide it with
next-generation jet fighters**. Washington must allow Taiwan to at least
to ensure that it can defend itself and prevent its self-defense
capabilities from ever eroding.]{.underline} 2. Washington should
continue to remind both sides of the Strait that it opposes the use of
force to settle the Taiwan issue, that a resolution of the Taiwan issue
is a matter for the two sides to decide themselves, and that the United
States does not support independence for Taiwan. 3. A free-trade
agreement would demonstrate American solidarity with Taiwan at a time
when China is intensifying its efforts to deny the small island nation
international representation and diplomatic ties with other countries.
This means making progress on the Trade and Investment Framework
Agreement (TIFA) process---a deal would help promote U.S. prosperity and
economic security. 4. Taiwan is still unable to fully participate in
most international organizations, despite this being a primary intent of
Section 4(d) of the TRA. Taiwan has the right and responsibility as a
member of the global community to participate in and contribute to
international organizations. Taiwan's inclusion is important not only
for the twenty-three million people on the island, and the United States
must continue efforts to overcome Taiwan's exclusion. 5. Taiwan is a
good friend and partner of the United States, and Taipei has been
providing assistance to Washington in dealing with a wide range of
matters on the global stage. A move by America to continue its
commitment to Taiwan is critical to the security of Washington, since
the two sides have established close ties through their attitudes toward
democracy and human rights. U.S.-Taiwan ties are also vital to peace in
the Asia-Pacific region. 6. Because of its proximity to---and
rapprochement with---China, Taiwan has carved out a unique role player
in the Asian Pacific as the stakes grow in the simmering tensions
between Washington and Beijing. Washington must work with Taipei
together toward a trilateral win-win relationship. Rather than fearing
possible damage to bilateral ties with China, Washington must work
closely with Taipei and take advantage of the benefits this important
partnership can offer. [In sum, the United States has an abiding
interest in peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. Toward that
end, the United States must support and encourage improvements in
cross-Strait relations, albeit at a pace acceptable to the people on
both sides. Strong United States support for Taiwan autonomy also helps
give twenty-three million people in Taiwan the confidence to strengthen
their cross-Strait relations.]{.underline} America's commitment to
Taiwan's safety and security is a hallmark of the TRA. Finally, Taiwan's
economic achievements over the last decades have proven the merits of
the TRA. Taiwan has aspired for greater integration into regional
economic and trade mechanisms. Looking forward, as America and Taiwan
commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the TRA, it is hoped that the
United States will continue to support Taiwan's democracy, freedom, and
economic prosperity, and continue to maintain a strong relationship with
Taiwan. Taipei deserves Washington's support in fulfilling the intent of
the congressional drafters of the Taiwan Relations Act.

### Alt Causes to Relations 

#### Cant Solve US-Sino Relations -- Multiple Alt Causes

**Swaine, 2019**

Michael D., With a PhD from Harvard, Swaine is a specialist in US-China
relations at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and is a
former senior policy analyst for the RAND corporation, A Relationship
Under Extreme Duress: U.S.-China Relations at a Crossroads, 1/16/19,
6/28/19,
https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/01/16/relationship-under-extreme-duress-u.s.-china-relations-at-crossroads-pub-78159//WS

Unfortunately, the positive momentum in the relationship has not lasted.
[While new challenges and opportunities initially served to justify and
compel greater U.S.-China cooperation in the first decade of the new
century, three other major unprecedented negative sets of
trends]{.underline}, both domestic and international, [also
appeared]{.underline} around the same time. These trends greatly
aggravated the differences between the United States and China and
eventually overshadowed the many positive factors at work in the
relationship. [The **first** trend emerged in the 1990s and 2000s and
produced two serious negative outcomes: severe damage to Beijing's
reputation in the West, which undermined expectations of China's
continued reform and opening, and a deepening of Chinese suspicions of
the United States and other democracies.]{.underline} [These
developments stemmed from Beijing's response to three major challenges
to CCP rule]{.underline}: [the collapse of communist and authoritarian
states]{.underline}, caused in part by the explosion of rapid,
internet-based forms of communication with freer societies[; the
emergence of unprecedented levels of corruption and socioeconomic
disorder]{.underline} in China in the 2000s, largely as a result of
decades of market-led, rapid economic growth and the failure to develop
an effective legal system; and [more dangerous forms of domestic
terrorism and unrest]{.underline}, occurring primarily in the ethnic
minority areas of Tibet and Xinjiang. This triple threat to CCP rule
greatly heightened the insecurities of China's leaders, prompting
efforts to purge the party ranks, strengthen overall party controls
throughout Chinese society, and increase the economic role of the state.
Those changes began during the Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao eras but have
intensified greatly under Xi Jinping. Most recently, such perceived
threats to the Party's leadership have caused Xi to build up his
personal position within the party, thus undermining the gradual
evolution of the Chinese political system toward a more predictable,
collective, and institutionalized pattern of rule. As a result of
Beijing's actions, [China's image among democratic states]{.underline},
already damaged by the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989, [declined much
further, as did Western confidence in China's commitment to pursue
continued growth through greater opening, marketization, and support for
the rule of law]{.underline}. To compound this blow to the relationship,
[Chinese leaders have become more deeply suspicious of Western
(]{.underline}and especially U.S.) [views and policies]{.underline}
toward China. Indeed, by the mid-1990s, the [CCP leadership concluded
that Washington and other democratic nations had contributed decisively
to the collapse or weakening of one-party systems elsewhere and might be
seeking similar ends for the PRC regime.]{.underline} Such fears and
suspicions were magnified by the long-standing, deeply rooted sense of
resentment toward the West many Chinese feel as a result of China's
so-called "Century of Humiliation." [A **second** set of highly negative
trends that emerged in the 2000s involved domestic developments in the
U.S. and the West,]{.underline} adding more suspicions on both sides
while also emboldening China's leaders in potentially dangerous ways.
Specifically, [the 2008 global recession, the deepening polarization of
American society, and the resulting near-paralysis of the U.S. political
system in dealing with critical domestic issues such as ballooning
health care and entitlement costs and huge government deficits created
two negative consequences for the U.S.-China relationship.]{.underline}
One is that many Chinese leaders somewhat tentatively concluded that the
United States had likely entered a period of systemic decline in which
America's ability to challenge or "contain" China's rise would drop
significantly, and the American model of pluralist democracy and
market-led economic growth would gradually lose its lustre. This dual
perception has strengthened the outlook of those within the Chinese
leadership, including Xi, who support a more confident use of China's
growing economic and military capabilities to push back against
Washington's supposed containment efforts and more vigorously defend or
advance Beijing's expanding interests overseas. This approach has
largely eclipsed the long-standing emphasis of the Deng Xiaoping era on
maintaining a relatively low international profile. It has given greater
license to those within China who prefer to give vent more vigorously to
long-held resentments against the West, or against so-called "hostile
Western forces," usually referring to the United States. Even more
worrisome, in the United States and other Western countries, wo[rsening
domestic economic and social problems\--exacerbated by the unprecedented
surge of both legal and illegal non-white immigrants]{.underline} into
Europe and the United States that began in the 2010s\-\--have [led to
the emergence of chauvinistic forms of nationalism hostile to
China]{.underline} and other countries. According to the line of
thinking currently so prominent in American politics, the globalization
of economic and social systems, most acutely manifested by Beijing's
conspicuous economic impact on Americans' daily lives, lies at the root
of growing domestic economic inequality, job losses, social injustice,
weakened national sovereignty and threatened cultural identity. In the
United States, [such hyper-nationalism is reflected most distinctively
in the extremist views of President Trump]{.underline}. He has
criticized U.S. politicians and global corporations for selling out U.S.
workers, and the national interest in general, by their support for
unfair multilateral trade agreements and by moving manufacturing
facilities to foreign countries. Most notably for U.S.-China relations,
Trump and his supporters have singled out China for special denunciation
when they blast a range of other countries as economic predators or
cheaters that aim to enrich themselves at America's expense. [A
**third** major factor contributing to the overwhelming negative
dynamics emerging in U.S.-China relations is China's very rapid
growth]{.underline}, which has passed certain key thresholds. Over the
last eighteen years, China has become the largest trading power in the
world, surpassed the Japanese economy to become the second largest
economic power overall, become a major source of innovation in key
high-tech sectors, accumulated massive foreign exchange reserves, and
transformed its military from a defense-oriented force focused mainly on
the homeland and Taiwan to a more expansive, sophisticated force capable
of operating at significant distances from China. While contributing to
global growth and the rise of living standards in many countries, [the
systemic changes arising from these developments have enhanced Chinese
confidence abroad while greatly stoking American fears]{.underline}. By
some measures, [China is now poised to equal America's military
footprint in the Western Pacific]{.underline}, which would effectively
end seventy years of U.S. maritime dominance in that critical region. In
addition, [Beijing is using its economic resources to
create]{.underline} what it hopes will become a vast network of
[interlinked economic structures and relationships]{.underline}
extending from China to Europe and Africa via both land and maritime
routes, the so-called Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). It is also
supporting or leading a variety of other multilateral and bilateral
economic and security initiatives\-\--such as new investment banks,
Asian economic associations, and strategic partnerships with U.S.
friends and adversaries alike\-\--that could significantly shape the
contours of the international system in new directions. Further, as
mentioned above, China is more assertively advancing, by economic,
political, and military means, its claims to disputed areas along its
maritime periphery from Northeast to Southeast Asia, thus alarming many
nearby states. Chinese confidence and assertiveness has increased, but
[certain more pessimistic Chinese sentiments have surfaced as well,
providing more fuel for the fears of American
hyper-nationalists]{.underline}. In recent years, slowing growth and
rising wages have intensified worries among Chinese economic policy
specialists about the so-called "middle income trap." This has produced
a policy consensus regarding the urgency of transforming China's economy
from a labor-intensive to a more competitive, innovation-driven economic
model. That, in turn, seems to underlie China's present very conspicuous
efforts to propel China into the top ranks of high-tech nations at the
fastest possible pace, by fair means or foul. For instance, while
spending billions of dollars on legitimate research and development,
[some Chinese entities now also engage in unprecedented levels of cyber
espionage, physical theft, coercive contract arrangements, and other
underhanded efforts to obtain cutting- edge technologies]{.underline}.
While certainly not justifying the blanket label of "economic predator"
applied by the Trumpists (see below), [these activities]{.underline},
along with perceived "unfair" protections of Chinese domestic
industries, [have significantly aggravated relations with more
developed, rule-of-law-based nations such as the United
States]{.underline}. Of particular note, they have contributed greatly
to the general souring of attitudes toward the China market evident
among many U.S. businesses, thus weakening a major historical pillar of
strong U.S.-China relations. A RELATIONSHIP ADRIFT AND TAKING ON WATER
[As a result of all the negative changes outlined above,]{.underline}
[the common (and in some areas growing) strategic logic, economic
incentives, and societal ties that long anchored the U.S.-China
relationship in the past are today rapidly disintegrating]{.underline}
under a tidal wave of growing mutual suspicion, faulty interpretations,
worst-case assumptions about motives, and zero-sum policy calculations.
Although this is happening in both Washington and Beijing, it is at this
time particularly evident in the United States.

The United States is locked into an intensifying confrontation with
China, and relations continue to rapidly deteriorate. [In the past
several weeks alone [trade talks]{.mark} have [broken down]{.mark},
President Donald [Trump]{.mark} has [raised]{.mark} [tariffs]{.mark} on

Trump has abandoned the naive hope that China could be persuaded to
liberalize and become a "responsible stakeholder" in the U.S.-led
liberal international order, and this adjustment is one for which he
deserves significant credit. Indeed, Trump's tough approach to China is
the one area where he enjoys broad bipartisan support, as even in badly
divided Washington there is growing recognition that China will be the
most formidable geostrategic competitor the United States has ever
faced. [Yet at the very moment when the United States faces its greatest

### Alt Cause to Relations -- Pompeo

#### Alt causes to US -- China relations -- Mike Pompeo

**Shih** 20**19**

(Gerry, Washington Post China correspondent based in Beijing, "As
U.S.-China relations fray, Beijing unleashes fury at one target:
Pompeo", June 27, 2019, date accessed 6/28/19,
https://www.pressherald.com/2019/06/27/as-u-s-china-relations-fray-beijing-unleashes-fury-at-one-target-pompeo/)//CS

BEIJING --- [He spouts "**lies and fallacies**,"]{.underline} according
to a Chinese government spokesman. "[A **cheerleader of
hatred**,]{.underline}" a Communist Party newspaper seethed. [He has
"**lost his mind**]{.underline}," a Chinese ambassador suggested in
April. [As U.S.-China relations scrape along their lowest level in
decades, one U.S. official has stood out as the most popular target of
Beijing's slings and arrows: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. China this
week singled out Pompeo in a remarkable, extended segment during the
state broadcaster's evening newscast]{.underline}. The top American
diplomat, whom state media recently likened to a gangster, didn't merit
a human comparison Wednesday night. "[The world needs to be vigilant
against the erosion to human peace caused by Pompeo, **which is like
that of a worm**]{.underline}," an anchor told hundreds of millions of
Chinese viewers. "[The entire diplomatic world ought to **despise and
suppress his conduct**."]{.underline} In some ways, [Pompeo's frequent
criticism of China touches on **well-worn sore spots** for
Beijing]{.underline}, such as human rights abuses against minority
Uighur Muslims in the Xinjiang region, [its trade practices and
allegations of espionage]{.underline}. But the depth of China's scorn
underlines the new, global dimensions of the U.S.-China rivalry. In
touring the world urging other countries to ban the Chinese company
Huawei, for instance, [Pompeo embodies the prospect that **irks and
unnerves China the most**: being encircled by the United States and
allies in a new Cold War.]{.underline} Asked for a response to the
attacks on Pompeo, a State Department spokesman said: "We will not
comment on ad hominem Chinese Communist Party propaganda." A senior
administration official said Pompeo has been advocating the position of
the U.S. government at large. "[Pushing back against Chinese bad
behavior was at the heart of President Trump's campaign and remains at
the center of his national security strategy]{.underline}," the official
said. "These are substantive issues that the United States is raising,
from debt diplomacy to trade to the systematic subjugation of Muslims."
This week, while U.S. and Chinese officials were preparing for a meeting
between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Japan,
Pompeo was in New Delhi coaxing the Indians to do more in the South
China Sea against a mutual rival, China. [In April, after **Pompeo
blamed China** for the crisis in Venezuela on a swing through Latin
America, the Chinese envoy to Chile told a newspaper Pompeo had gone
mad.]{.underline} In Beijing, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Lu Kang,
asked Pompeo to "take a break." ["For quite some time, certain U.S.
politicians have been touring the globe with the same script in their
pockets to smear China, starting fires and fanning the flames and sowing
discords," Lu told reporters.]{.underline} Given his public-facing
position, [Pompeo has attracted Beijing's ire more readily than China
hawks who work behind the scenes]{.underline}, such as economic adviser
Peter Navarro or national security adviser John Bolton. [Even President
Trump gets a relative pass in the state media compared with Pompeo, who
is **described more as an ideologue and gets pilloried** on a weekly if
not daily basis.]{.underline} Vice President Mike Pence is also viewed
warily, Chinese foreign policy experts say, after he delivered a tough
speech in October that stunned many in Beijing, who compared it to
Winston Churchill's 1946 "Iron Curtain" address. The Chinese say that
after Beijing and Washington navigated their bilateral relationship on
practical grounds for decades, officials such as [Pompeo now represent
an ideological turn in the United States that **fundamentally opposes**
the Communist Party's governance.]{.underline} "[Mike Pompeo, along with
Vice president Mike Pence, are no doubt the two U.S. politicians that
China hates the most at the moment]{.underline}," said Shi Yinhong, a
professor of international relations at Renmin University. "[Pompeo
cemented his '**China-hater'** status by making a series of imperious
and hard-line criticism of China from our Xinjiang and Hong Kong
policies to the Tiananmen protests in 1989. Worse still, he attempted to
use all those aspects to **attack** China's political
system."]{.underline} Amid intensely personal pieces aimed his direction
this week, the Global Times newspaper referred to Pompeo's tenure as the
head of the C.I.A., mused on the prospect of his running for political
office, and suggested he was enriching himself through ties with the
defense industry -- all to build a portrait of a "malicious poisoner of
global diplomacy." The paper weighed the legacy of American diplomats
such as Benjamin Franklin and Henry Kissinger. [Pompeo should be
considered **more extreme in his opposition** to China than the original
"Cold War knight]{.underline}," his Eisenhower-era predecessor John
Foster Dulles, it concluded. Zhu Feng, a prominent scholar at Nanjing
University whose long-term U.S. visa was revoked as he left Los Angeles
recently, said [the unusually pitched criticism reflected a broad
"nervousness" in China -- from the government in Beijing to the business

### Arms Sales Don\'t Effect Relations

#### Arms sales wont effect US-Sino Relations and even if it does China's response is just sabre rattling

Shannon **Tiezzi**, 12/18/**15**, Editor-in-Chief at *The Diplomat*, "On
Taiwan Arms Sales, China's Bark May Be Worse Than Its Bite", 06/24/19,

[The first arms sale to Taiwan authorized by the Obama administration
came in January 2010. Worth \$6.4 billion]{.underline}, the deal
included 113 PAC-3 missile defense missiles and 60 Black Hawk
helicopters. [China's response was more robust than normal]{.underline}
-- perhaps, as James Mann suggested in his book *The Obamians,* because
[Beijing believed it had a shot at ending U.S. arms sales to Taiwan once
and for all under Barack Obama]{.underline}. Regardless, a Chinese vice
foreign minister summoned then-U.S. Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman to
issue a protest. Most relevant for today's context, [Beijing also
threatened to sanction the U.S. companies involved in the sale, and to
cut off military exchanges with the United States]{.underline}. So what
became of those threats? [In the short-term, China did seriously curtail
military relations, shutting down military dialogues and exchanges for
almost all of 2010]{.underline}. The most noticeable effect was Beijing
denying then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates permission to visit China
after the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore. That led Gates to publicly
chastise China in his speech at the Dialogue for breaking off military
relations "over something that is, quite frankly, old news."
[Eventually, U.S.-China relations warmed again]{.underline} (thanks in
part to the desire of both sides to make Hu Jintao's state visit to the
United States in 2011 a success) [and Gates got to visit China in
January 2011]{.underline}. [Interestingly, the promised sanctions
against U.S. firms]{.underline} (which, as is the case today, were
always a vague concept[) never came]{.underline}. [That may be in part
because two of the firms involved in the 2010 sale -- Boeing and General
Electric -- have major commercial interests in China]{.underline}.
[Actually following through on sanctioning these companies would have
been a serious escalation in an already-tense relationship]{.underline}.
[In September 2011, the United States announced a \$5.9 billion upgrade
package for Taiwan's F-16A/B fighter jets, to a fairly muted reaction
from Beijing]{.underline}. Once again, a vice foreign minister (this
time Zhang Zhijun) summoned the U.S. ambassador (then Gary Locke) to
lodge a protest[. Zhang warned the sale would "inevitably" take a toll
on the overall relationship, especially military ties]{.underline}.
[Yet, even though one Chinese military officer urged China to "take
revenge" in an article for the People's Daily, Beijing didn't take major
steps to retaliate for the sale]{.underline}. A few U.S.-China military
contacts were postponed, but nothing on the scale of 2010's break. Part
of that, however, may have been related to timing -- [Beijing was
unwilling to create a huge issue in U.S.-China relations only a few
months before a heavily anticipated tour of the United States by then
president-in-waiting Xi Jinping]{.underline}. Xi's February 2012 visit
to the U.S. was seen as a display of his foreign policy prowess ahead of
his actually assuming China's top leadership roles; Beijing needed the
visit to go off smoothly. Meanwhile, Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou,
who had spearheaded a warming of cross-strait relations during his first
term, faced reelection in January 2012. China's leadership may have
decided to cut Ma a break by not lashing out over the arms sale, in the
hopes he would win reelection (and he did). So, with that background,
what should we make of this week's reaction from Beijing? First, it's
interesting that China summoned the U.S. charge d'affaires, rather than
Ambassador Max Baucus himself, to lodge its protest -- that suggests a
more moderate response. Military relations will likely suffer in the
short term, but given the intense work both sides have put into
institutionalizing those ties since 2011, a serious break a la 2010
would be a huge blow, and likely farther than Beijing wants to go for
the smallest Taiwan arms sale yet of the Obama administration. The
proposed sanctions on U.S. companies are interesting, as it provides a
new lever for Beijing to pull when responding to these arms sales. And
despite what many observers dismiss as pro forma responses from China,
[it should be noted that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan remain the top issue
of concern listed by Chinese military officials when discussing the
relationship]{.underline}. [But Beijing has made the sanctions threat
before and not followed through -- much as the Obama administration has
yet to follow through on its threat to sanction Chinese companies
profiting from cyber espionage. The threat alone remains a useful policy
tool, and Beijing may again decide that warnings -- rather than action
-- are enough.]{.underline}

### Arms Sales Good -- Key to Solve Invasion 

#### China is poised for an invasion now -- Arms sales are the only way to prevent that

At the G-20 summit this week, Chinese President [Xi]{.underline} Jinping
[may pressure]{.underline} U.S. President Donald [Trump to halt a
planned U.S. arms deal with Taiwan]{.underline}. [Xi may even offer
a]{.underline} tantalizing (but unreliable) [concession on the trade
dispute in return for concessions on Taiwan]{.underline}. Accepting such
an offer would undermine U.S. national security and the democratic
principles Americans support. Bullies tend to start fights they think
they can win, an important consideration when it comes to deterring
Beijing from aggression against Taiwan. Unfortunately, [due to China's
massive military mobilization and Washington's past reluctance to
provide sufficient arms to Taiwan, the military balance of power in the
Taiwan Strait has shifted in Beijing's direction]{.underline} --- making
war there more likely. To begin reducing this risk, Washington would be
wise to follow through on delivery of the pending arms package for
Taiwan. Based on the hope that economic liberalization would lead to
political liberalization, Washington facilitated Beijing's integration
into the global economy. American support for China's entry into the
World Trade Organization epitomized this strategy. Unfortunately,
increased wealth did not launch an inexorable march toward freedom in
China. Instead, the Chinese Communist Party, or CCP, used its financial
windfall to fund a major military expansion, bully its neighbors and
attempt to push the U.S. out of the region. These dynamics have been
perhaps most pronounced in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan is prosperous and
democratic, which creates an uncomfortable contrast for the CCP and an
object of emulation for its subjects on the mainland. As in Hong Kong,
the people of Taiwan have grown accustomed to their freedoms and are
reluctant to give them up. Impatient --- and determined to exert control
over the island --- [Beijing has employed political and military means
to isolate and intimidate Taiwan]{.underline}. First, Beijing has
pressed countries to cut ties with Taiwan. In 2018 alone, China
successfully pressured three more countries to sever Taiwanese
relations, leaving only 17 that recognize the island's government.
[Taiwan's diplomatic isolation makes American support all the more
important]{.underline}. More dangerously, due primarily to its
extraordinary military buildup, **[Beijing is moving ever closer to an
ability to successfully invade the island]{.underline}**. The U.S.
Defense Department's Indo-Pacific Strategy Report released this month
notes that "[China has never renounced the use of military force against
Taiwan, and continues to develop and deploy advanced military
capabilities needed for a potential military campaign]{.underline}."
Indeed, [as demonstrated by an increased number of military exercises
near Taiwan]{.underline}, the report warns that **[the
P]{.underline}**eople's **[L]{.underline}**iberation
**[A]{.underline}**rmy **[is "preparing for a contingency to unify
Taiwan with the mainland by force]{.underline}**." In the past, Taiwan's
superior technology and geography gave Taiwan a military edge when it
came to a potential conflict in the strait. However, as the Pentagon
noted, due to China's military buildup, those advantages are now largely
gone. In fact, as the Defense Intelligence Agency's 2019 report on
Chinese military power assessed, "[Beijing's longstanding interest to
eventually compel Taiwan's reunification with the mainland and deter any
attempt by Taiwan to declare independence has served as the primary
driver for China's military modernization]{.underline}." Simultaneously,
based on an overzealous and counterproductive desire in previous
administrations to avoid offending Beijing, [Washington has often been
reluctant to provide Taiwan the arms it needed]{.underline}. Fearful to
not provoke the Chinese, the Obama administration rejected Taiwanese
requests for 66 new F-16 fighter jets --- instead only offering
modifications for its aging aircraft. Admittedly, America's arms sales
to Taiwan are relatively modest compared to China's military buildup.
However, [the failure to provide Taiwan the required weapons exacerbated
the shift toward Beijing in the military balance]{.underline}. [As a
result]{.underline}, across most combat domains, [Beijing has
established both a quantitative and qualitative advantage over
Taiwan]{.underline}. Consequently, **[there is a risk that Beijing
planners and decision-makers might determine they could launch a
successful offensive against Taiwan]{.underline}**. [That perception in
Beijing makes aggression in the strait and a war with the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [more likely]{.underline}. The
bipartisan National Defense Strategy Commission listed aggression
against Taiwan as a top concern, arguing that **[allowing China to
absorb Taiwan by military force would constitute a "crushing blow to
America's credibility and regional position]{.underline}**." In addition
to genuine hard-power concerns, there is also a matter of principle.
When an authoritarian power threatens and bullies a democratic people,
America is not neutral. Furthermore, providing Taiwan the means to
defend itself is not just consistent with sound policy and good
principle --- it is the law. The Taiwan Relations Act made clear that
the establishment of diplomatic relations with Beijing rested on the
expectation that the future of Taiwan would be "determined by peaceful
means." To make this a reality, the law says the U.S. will provide the
weapons "necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient
self-defense capability." Admittedly, successive U.S. administrations
have interpreted and implemented this rather vague statute differently.
However, what seems clear is that **[Taiwan's ability to defend itself
against an increasingly belligerent and capable military threat from the
mainland is in doubt]{.underline}**. That would suggest that **[the
current arms package under consideration is not only permissible and
advisable under the law, but essential]{.underline}**. The
administration deserves credit for expanding freedom of navigation
operations in the Taiwan Strait and, at least initially, asking Congress
to support new arms sales to Taiwan. Those are good first steps, but
they are not enough. **[In addition to providing]{.underline}** these
**[arms without delay and stopping the erosion of U.S. military
superiority]{.underline}** vis-a-vis China, **[Washington should also
provide Taiwan the fighter aircraft and other weapons it needs to make
Beijing think twice before undertaking aggression in the
strait]{.underline}**. In its report this month, the Pentagon reiterated
the U.S. commitment to Taiwan's self-defense, invoking the words of the
Taiwan Relations Act. Those are good words. But in any potential
conversation with President Xi this week, President Trump would do well
to remember that it will take more than words to deter aggression from
the bullies in Beijing.

"China must be, and will be reunified," Chinese President
[Xi]{.underline} Jinping
[declared](http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/leaders/2019-01/02/c_1123937757.htm)
in a speech in January. Xi spoke of "peaceful reunification" with
Taiwan, but he warned, "We [do not forsake the use of
force]{.underline}." Ever since Hong Kong and Macau rejoined Mainland
China in 1997 and 1999, respectively, Chinese expectations that Taiwan
would follow suit have grown. When, a decade ago, the Beijing Olympics
and the global financial crisis boosted China's confidence on the world
stage, those expectations redoubled. But "[peaceful reunification" has
proved elusive]{.underline}. After Taiwan elected Tsai Ing-wen, of the
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), to the presidency
in 2016, many Mainland Chinese lost patience with the idea. Some Chinese
nationalists now argue that China has only a brief window of opportunity
to seize Taiwan. Talk of "forceful reunification" is ascendant. China
has already begun to tighten the noose. It has forced Taiwan out of
international bodies, such as the World Health Organization; required
airlines to replace "Taiwan" with descriptions such as "Taiwan, Province
of China"; and induced five more countries to sever relations with
Taipei. Beijing seems to believe that the United States will sit by as
it squeezes Taiwan. Taipei, meanwhile, has convinced itself that China
has no plans to invade. And U.S. President Donald Trump seems to think
he can rock the boat without consequences. All are wrong---and their
wishful thinking is raising the odds of conflict. "CHINA DREAM" IN
BEIJING Now that [Xi has consolidated power]{.underline}, he
[seeks]{.underline} a legacy befitting the great emperors of old: the
[reunification]{.underline} of the Middle Kingdom. "The only thing that
will make him the greatest leader in the Chinese Communist Party's
history is to take Taiwan back," Shen Dingli, a foreign relations
scholar at Fudan University, [told
Quartz](https://qz.com/1218961/what-xi-jinping-wants-to-do-with-his-unrivalled-power/)
in 2018. "If he were to achieve China's reunification, who will say he
is second to Mao Zedong or Deng Xiaoping?\" Xi, whose "China Dream"
promises to make China great again, likely agrees. "**[Fight a war, win
a war," is one of his signature slogans]{.underline}**. In 2017, he
presided over a military parade with a replica of Taiwan's presidential
palace visible in the distance. Chinese soldiers had constructed it to
train for an invasion of Taiwan. That same year, China's first aircraft
carrier, the Liaoning, circumnavigated Taiwan twice. "**[The PLA
is]{.underline}** likely **[preparing for a contingency to unify Taiwan
with China by force]{.underline}**," the U.S. Defense Department [told
Congress](https://media.defense.gov/2018/Aug/16/2001955282/-1/-1/1/2018-CHINA-MILITARY-POWER-REPORT.PDF)

invades Taiwan. "[Xi]{.underline} has told people that he [was impressed

[told](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red) the

[declared](http://taiwan.huanqiu.com/thwl/2016-12/9985848.html) in 2017.
"There will very likely be military conflict," retired Chinese General

sentiment is widespread. "Mainland Chinese public opinion became

journalist Huang Nian [wrote](https://udn.com/news/story/11321/3087200)
in April. "[Forceful reunification would derail it."]{.underline} This
[complacency has led Taiwan to neglect its armed forces]{.underline}.
[Taiwan's military suffers from a desperate shortage of
officers]{.underline}---[nearly half of all lieutenant positions are

recommended that Taiwan consider restoring conscription. "[The shift to
a voluntary military was a mistake]{.underline}," U.S. officials
[concluded](https://cybsbox.cy.gov.tw/CYBSBoxSSL/edoc/download/24967).
In an [April 2018 poll](https://www.storm.mg/article/428123), [more than
40 percent of Taiwanese said they had "no confidence at all" that their
military could defend Taiwan; but 65 percent had convinced themselves
that the PRC would not take military action against the
island;]{.underline} and only six percent believed that an attack was
"very likely." "AMERICA FIRST" IN WASHINGTON The withering of Taiwan's
armed forces has increased Taiwan's military reliance on the United
States---just when many in Beijing are questioning the U.S. commitment
to Taiwan. [Trump's "America first" doctrine has convinced many Chinese
that the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is]{.underline} now
[too isolationist to come to Taiwan's defense]{.underline}. "[America
will absolutely sacrifice Taiwan]{.underline}," the Global Times
[insisted](http://taiwan.huanqiu.com/article/2017-01/9999421.html) in
2017. "On the premise of America First ... the United States is not
likely to send troops to fight for Taiwan." For decades, a U.S. policy
of "dual deterrence" has helped prevent conflict in the Taiwan Strait.
Washington has warned Beijing not to attack Taiwan unprovoked, but
reassured Chinese leaders that the United States would not support
Taiwanese independence. It has told Taipei, in turn, that the United
States would come to its defense---as long as it did not provoke Beijing
by declaring independence. Making the policy work has meant treading a
fine line, but for decades, dual deterrence has allowed Taiwan to enjoy
de facto independence and helped prevent a war with China. Trump has
upset that delicate balance. In December 2016, Tsai called Trump to
congratulate him on his victory. The incoming Trump administration then
began to talk of "revisiting" the One China policy, under which the
United States recognizes the People's Republic of China as the sole
legal government of China, but maintains unofficial relations with
Taiwan. Beijing was outraged. Xi refused to talk to Trump until he
recommitted the United States to the One China policy. In February,
Trump capitulated. In a phone call with Xi, he affirmed that the United
States would continue to support the "One China" policy. "Trump lost his
first fight with Xi," the Beijing scholar Shi Yinhong
[bragged](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/10/world/asia/trump-one-china-taiwan.html)
to the New York Times. "He will be looked at as a paper tiger." Last
year, however, the pendulum swung back toward confrontation. In
February, Congress passed the Taiwan Travel Act, encouraging (but not
requiring) high-level U.S. officials to visit Taiwan, and high-level
Taiwanese officials to visit the United States. In the fall, Trump
started a trade war with China, generating anxiety among **[Chinese
nationalists]{.underline}**. They now **[believe Trump is using Taiwan
as part of a new Cold War against China, creating a sense of urgency for
reunification]{.underline}**. A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY China could well
move to take Taiwan before 2020, when some Chinese fear that Taiwan's
presidential election will close Beijing's window of opportunity for
military action. Many Mainland Chinese nationalists were disappointed,
rather than relieved, by the pro-independence DPP's poor showing in last
November's local Taiwanese elections. This counterintuitive reaction
reveals an alarming calculus: [should a weakened Tsai and the DPP lose
the presidency in 2020]{.underline} to a more pro-China candidate, [the
opportunity for "forceful reunification" would be lost]{.underline}.
"What a pity," one Weibo user from Beijing
[wrote](https://www.weibo.com/1974576991/H4gYticya?type=comment) about
the DPP's losses. ["We could be further away from the day of
reunification."]{.underline} It is the hated DPP that gives Chinese
nationalists a pretext to take Taiwan back now. That disappointment has
fed a sense of urgency among many Chinese nationalists. "I request that
Mainland China issue a timetable for reunification," one outraged Weibo
user [wrote](https://www.weibo.com/1974576991/H4gYticya?type=comment) in
November. "Whether peaceful or forceful, please don't drag this out
again and again." The 2020 U.S. presidential election also looms in the
minds of Chinese nationalists. Trump looks less likely to win reelection
after Democratic victories in the 2018 midterms, and [many Chinese worry
that a Trump loss would make forceful reunification harder]{.underline}.
Trump is seen as a businessman and isolationist willing to bargain
Taiwan away. "America will sell Taiwan out in the blink of an eye," a
People's Daily [editorial
claimed](http://opinion.haiwainet.cn/n/2018/0322/c456465-31284500.html)
last year. (Few Chinese recognize the possibility that Trump might
respond forcefully to an attack on Taiwan to rally support at home.) A
Trump successor, "forceful reunification" advocates fear, may not be so
willing to cut a deal. [Some in Beijing even think China
can]{.underline} retake Taiwan without violence. China may "break the
enemy's resistance without fighting," Wang Zaixi
[told](http://sc.people.com.cn/n2/2017/0105/c345527-29554902.html) the
Global Times in 2017. Just as the Communist Party seized Beijing in 1949
without shooting a single bullet, he argued, China could [capture Taiwan
peacefully by surrounding the island, imposing economic sanctions, and
cutting off its oil supply]{.underline}. "No need to shed blood," he
concluded. [The idea that China can force reunification without fighting
is delusional and dangerous]{.underline}. Tightening the military or
economic noose around Taiwan [would likely provoke a reaction from the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. [Given popular nationalist
pressures, Beijing would]{.underline} then feel compelled to
[respond]{.underline}. Things could get out of control fast. All sides
need to wake up to the dangers of backing into a conflict that few want.

platforms would help Taiwan defend against the overwhelming air and
missile attack that China would employ in any attack. The purchases
would sit alongside improvements to Taiwan\'s defense portfolio, such as
its modernizing air force.]{.underline} China, predictably, is

military buildup proximate to Taiwan, and by Chinese President Xi

these tensions to the point of war, neither should we allow Beijing to
pursue an unrestrained hostile policy. That course of action **will only
embolden Xi, leading him to believe he can corral or force Taiwan\'s

more.]{.underline}

States did not abandon most of the substantive features of its relations
with Taipei. There was no longer an American Embassy, but a nominally
private 'American Institute in Taiwan,' which essentially served the
same function. US forces were withdrawn from Taiwan, and the Mutual
Defence Treaty was terminated; but, as we shall see, Taiwan eventually
obtained a form of a security commitment through the provisions of the
Taiwan Relations Act.31 [Though the character of US relations with
Taiwan changed significantly at a formal level, the effects of that
change were muted at a substantive and practical level. Nevertheless, it
would not be accurate to say that the changes were purely semantic.
Given the unofficial character of US relations with Taiwan and Taiwan's
continuing insecurity, the United States' **Taiwan policy became much
more complex.**]{.underline} The US position on Taiwan bears the
unmistakable imprint of the historical period in which Washington and
Beijing pursued rapprochement. During the Cold War, neither the
Nationalists in Taipei nor the Communists in Beijing would have accepted
a permanent division between Taiwan and mainland China; the notion of an
independent Taiwan and the notion of 'two Chinas' were both anathema to
the rival Chinese regimes. Nor would it have been politically feasible
for the United States to allow Taiwan to come under the control of the
Chinese Communists; the Nationalists exercised 27 Copper, Taiwan, 56-57

considerable influence on US foreign policy through a network of
supporters who were collectively known as the 'China Lobby.'32 [The
objective of US policy was to change recognition from Taipei to Beijing
without creating the pretext for the Chinese Communists to seize control
of Taiwan. The solution was to adopt a neutral position on the question
of Taiwan's status and how it would be resolved. The United States
neither supported Taiwan's independence nor recognised Taiwan as part of
China. The United States affirmed its interest in a peaceful resolution
of the Taiwan Question, but it only stated a position on the process,
not on the outcome.33 Over time, a patchwork of communiqués and
legislation came to collectively define the 'One-China policy,' which is
the basic US position on the Taiwan Question.]{.underline} Richard Bush,
who previously served as the managing director of the American Institute
in Taiwan, lists the elements of the One-China policy as follows: 34
When American officials say that "we have a One-China policy," they
usually elaborate by listing several defining elements: adherence to the
three U.S.-PRC communiqués of 1972, 1978, and 1982; implementation of
the Taiwan Relations Act enacted in April 1979; an abiding interest in
the peaceful resolution of the differences between the two sides;
opposition to either side unilaterally changing the status quo and
non-support for de jure independence of Taiwan; the "six assurances"
conveyed to Taiwan in August 1982; and a preference for continuing
dialogue and cooperation between Beijing and Taipei, among others.35 The
One-China policy is distinct from the 'One-China principle' in that it
does not entail recognition of Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan; ever
since the Korean War, the United States has consistently (though
quietly) maintained the position that the status of Taiwan is
undetermined.36 It is essentially a neutral position on the issue of
sovereignty. [But **neutrality does not mean US indifference on the
issue of Taiwan's security**. As the PRC has never renounced the option
of using military force against Taiwan, so the United States has never
renounced the option of intervening in Taiwan's defence. The nature of
the US commitment to Taiwan's security was defined more clearly in the
Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) of 1979. Under the terms of the TRA, one of
the elements of US policy is to 'maintain the capacity of the United
States to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that
would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic system, of the
people on Taiwan.]{.underline}'37 [The United States is not required to
defend Taiwan in the event of a PRC attack, but it is required to
maintain the conditions that would make defending Taiwan a realistic
possibility. This forms part of the posture of 'strategic ambiguity,' in
which the United States has been deliberately vague about whether or not
it would intervene in Taiwan's defence]{.underline}.38 The logic behind
this posture is that [an unconditional commitment to Taiwan's security
might be interpreted by Beijing as a sign of eventual US support for
Taiwan's independence, and, according to some Chinese analysts, **an
unconditional commitment might encourage Taipei to undertake
destabilising actions**; while no commitment at all might encourage
Beijing to use military force against Taipei]{.underline}.39 32 Taylor,

[The TRA also states that US policy is 'to provide Taiwan with arms of a
defensive character' and that 'the President and the Congress shall
determine the nature and quantity of such defense articles and services
based solely upon their judgment of the needs of Taiwan, in accordance
with procedures established by law.'40 These **arms sales to Taiwan have
been a source of recurring tension between Washington and Beijing.**
Although the 1982 Joint Communiqué between the United States and the PRC
seemed to imply that these arms sales would be gradually reduced,
President Reagan stated to Deng Xiaoping that 'the U.S. willingness to
reduce its arms sales to Taiwan is conditioned absolutely upon the
continual commitment of China to the peaceful resolution of the
Taiwan-PRC differences.'41 As **Beijing has not renounced the use of
force, so the United States has not ceased the sale of
arms.**]{.underline} An insightful example of how social-scientific
theory has been applied to the US approach to the Taiwan Question is a
2002 article in the Washington Quarterly by Thomas Christensen. Drawing
on Thomas Schelling's concept of [coercive diplomacy, Christensen writes
that 'successful deterrence is a form of coercive bargaining that
requires a mix of credible threats and credible assurances.'42 He argues
that deterring Beijing from using military force against Taipei is a
question not only of demonstrating US support for Taiwan's security, but
also of reassuring Beijing that refraining from force will not lead to
the independence of Taiwan. Christensen concludes that 'a commitment to
Taiwan's freedom and democracy, but not its sovereignty, will allow the
United States to strengthen Taiwan's military security, improve military
contacts with Taiwan, and enhance protection of U.S. forward-deployed
forces where necessary and possible, without triggering conflict in the
process.'43 **The objective of deterrence in the Strait of Taiwan should
be to ensure that Beijing prefers the terms of peace to the cost of
war.**]{.underline} In brief, the United States has defined its policy
on Taiwan as one of neutrality on the question of sovereignty, stating
an interest in the process alone, and not the outcome, of the resolution
of the Taiwan Question. [US relations with Taiwan are of a strictly
unofficial character, but the United States has sold weapons to Taiwan
and maintained an ambiguous commitment to Taiwan's security, which opens
up the possibility for the United States to intervene in Taiwan's
defence. These elements are collectively known as the 'One-China policy'
and, **with the exception of arms sales**, are similar to the official
EU position on the Taiwan Question. The One-China policy is distinct
from the One-China principle, and the two terms should not be used
interchangeably.]{.underline}

submarine tech for local program", 4/7/17, accessed 6/28/19

[Taiwan is short five critical pieces of sub]{.underline}marine
[tech]{.underline}nology [that it needs to achieve its aim of building a
new class of indigenous submarines]{.underline}, according to a
Taiwanese defense analyst. Speaking to Defense News, Liao Yen-fan, a
Taipei-based analyst for the cybersecurity research firm Team T5 that
also focuses on air power and the Taiwanese military, said [the local
defense industry still needs to import the technology for these five
items]{.underline}, which [include modern torpedo tubes and
periscopes]{.underline}. Liao was citing representatives from Taiwan\'s
Ching Fu Shipbuilding, the company in charge of designing the combat
system and the largest subcontractor for Taiwan\'s domestic submarine
program. The program currently is in the design phase and is led by the
state-run National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology, or
NCSIST. CSBC Corporation is the main contractor. It\'s unclear what
other critical submarine technology Taiwan requires, although it likely
includes air-independent propulsion technology or an equivalent to allow
the submarine to be practically silent when operating in a submerged
environment. Liao told Defense News that Taiwanese delegations have
recently been dispatched around the world to try and secure the needed
technology transfer, including to the United States and Japan. However,
it is understood that [Japan has refused Taiwan\'s request for
assistance]{.underline}, almost certainly [out of fear of antagonizing
China]{.underline}, which sees Taiwan as a breakaway province and has
not ruled out the use of force to reunify the island with the mainland.
A budget equivalent to \$94.81 million has been allocated from December
2016 to December 2020 for the design of the new boats, according to an
earlier report presented by Taiwan\'s Ministry of National Defense.
Construction of the boats will follow the design phase, with CSBC
expecting [the first submarine to be built in eight years]{.underline}
and entering service with Taiwan\'s Navy 10 years after completion of
the design. The Navy is in the process of upgrading its two
Zwaardvis-class diesel-electric submarines purchased from the
Netherlands in the 1980s, with local media reporting that NCSIST will
enlist the help of foreign companies for the upgrade. The institute also
completed an evaluation of periscope upgrades and is in the process of
reviewing a design to upgrade their weapons systems.
**[Sub]{.underline}**marine[**s will** be an important asymmetric
capability and will **complicate any attempt** by China **to take Taiwan
by force**]{.underline}, [even though the former has undertaken a
massive effort to modernize]{.underline} its armed forces [and now
outguns Taiwan by a significant margin]{.underline}. In contrast,
[Taiwan has been compelled to increasingly rely on local industry to
meet]{.underline} its [defense needs]{.underline}, with China having
successfully used its substantial economic and political clout to
restrict the sale of advanced weapons to Taiwan. This reluctance could
prove to be a serious stumbling block to Taiwan\'s submarine ambitions.
Several Western European countries, most notably Sweden, France and
Germany, have established submarine programs and will possess the
technology that Taiwan needs. However, like Japan, they would likely
loathe to anger China with the sale of such significant weapons
technology to Taiwan. Even the United States, which is bound by the
Taiwan Relations Act to assist Taiwan, has severely limited its arms
sales to what it deems as \"self-defense\" weapons.

#### DCS now means Taiwan develops its own sub program

**Yeo 18**

[The State Department has given the go-ahead for American defense
companies to market submarine tech]{.underline}nology [to Taiwan to aid
in its quest to locally develop and build its own
sub]{.underline}marine[s]{.underline}. According to media reports from
Taiwan, the Ministry of National Defense spokesman Maj. Gen. Chen
Chung-chi and presidential office spokesman Sidney Lin confirmed that
[the State Department has granted the marketing license
required]{.underline} for the sale of technology to Taiwan. [The
granting of the license is a significant step for Taiwan's domestic
sub]{.underline}marine [program]{.underline}, and Lin added that [the
decision would upgrade Taiwan's self-defense capabilities]{.underline},
as well as benefit the safety and security of the region. Neither
official provided specifics about the submarine-related system the
marketing license has been approved for. However, Liao Yen-fan, a
Taipei-based analyst who focuses on air power and the Taiwanese
military, told Defense News that the approvals cover a marketing license
for a submarine combat management system, or CMS, along with a separate
technical assistance agreement. [This will cover some of the critical
areas of submarine development that Taiwan lacks]{.underline}, which
according to Dr. Collin Koh, research fellow at the Maritime Security
Programme at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies,
also includes sonar systems, modern periscopes and weapons systems. [The
latter will be in addition to the Mk-48 advanced heavyweight torpedo
Taiwan gained approval from the State Department to acquire]{.underline}
in June 2017 [under]{.underline} the [F]{.underline}oreign
[M]{.underline}iliary [S]{.underline}ales program. However, Liao said
that [the latest license approvals will]{.underline} instead [fall under
the D]{.underline}irect [C]{.underline}ommercial [S]{.underline}ales
program, and the two companies the approvals have been granted for have
not yet been named. Propulsion is one area the U.S. will be unable to
assist in Taiwan's submarine quest. Taiwan is seeking conventionally
powered diesel-electric submarines, while the U.S. Navy currently
operates only nuclear-powered boats. Taiwan may need to seek help from
other countries that build diesel-electric submarines for assistance,
particularly if it seeks enhanced underwater propulsion systems such as
Air-Independent Propulsion or AIP, according to Koh. Koh added that [if
Taiwan is content to eschew AIP for its new submarines, it is within the
capabilities of Taiwan's own local shipbuilding industry]{.underline}
and National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology or NCSIST
[to develop its own diesel-electric propulsion system, or
adapt]{.underline} commercial marine engines and generators for
submarine use. [The submarines are a central plank of Taiwan's ambitious
\$15 billion shipbuilding and]{.underline} force [modernization
program]{.underline}, with the equivalent of \$94.81 million being
allocated from December 2016 to December 2020 for the design of the new
boats. It has been reported that preliminary design was completed in
March, although the MND denied the reports. Taiwan is also carrying out
a life-extension program on its two Zwaardvis-class diesel-electric
submarines purchased from the Netherlands in the 1980s. Taiwan, an
island just off the east coast of China and separated by the Taiwan
Strait, is viewed by China as a rogue province following the end of the
Chinese civil war in 1949. A massive force modernization program over
the past two decades has seen China substantially outgunning Taiwan
today, and [submarines are seen to be an important asymmetric capability
and will complicate any attempt by China to take Taiwan by
force]{.underline}. China has also successfully used its substantial
economic and political clout to restrict the sale of advanced weapons to
Taiwan. Even the United States is bound by the Taiwan Relations Act,
which limits arms sales to "self-defense" weapons.

**[Taipei and Beijing are seemingly sliding into an escalatory spiral

last week, [China's defense minister invoked **Abraham Lincoln** to
justify the]{.underline} Chinese Communist Party's ([CCP) increasingly
aggressive reunification policy]{.underline}: "American friends told me
that Abraham Lincoln was the greatest American president because he led
the country to victory in the Civil War and prevented the secession of
the U.S. The U.S. is indivisible, so is China. **[China must be and will
be reunified."]{.underline}** Meanwhile, [Taiwan's government called on
China to " **repent**" on]{.underline} the coming 30th anniversary of
the 1989 [Tiananmen Square]{.underline} protests. Much of the media
coverage of the ongoing Taiwan-China dispute is focused on the
international repercussions of another Taiwan crisis; more specifically,
on how Washington would react to Chinese military aggression against
Taiwan. But what are Taiwan's military capabilities, and does Taiwan
stand a chance of repelling a prospective Chinese invasion? The National
Interest previously looked at the Taiwanese air force (ROCAF). We now
turn to Taiwan's navy. As a maritime nation embroiled in a serious
military dispute with a larger neighbor, [Taiwan's navy]{.underline}
(ROCN) [is unique for their nearly utter lack of a
sub]{.underline}marine [force]{.underline}. [Taiwan's submarine roster
consists of one US-purchased Hai Shih sub]{.underline}marine, the last
of the WWII-era Tench-class line to remain in service in 2019, and a
handful of Dutch-made Hai Lung submarines procured in the 1980's. As
with many of ROC's military shortcomings, Taiwan's submarine deficit is
the byproduct of a postwar strategic culture in which Tapei saw itself
as a major regional power, compensating for the PLA's numerical
advantage with superior training and equipment. But after [decades
of]{.underline} breakneck [Chinese military modernization]{.underline}
[coupled with creeping Taiwanese military stagnation]{.underline},
[Taiwan's surface navy is no position to contest the S]{.underline}outh
[C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea in any kind of pitched conflict
with the People's Liberation Army Navy. Taiwan's political leadership
has only recently begun to come to grips with the reality that
sea-control is no longer a viable military strategy. Instead, [Taiwan's
only recourse against]{.underline} a qualitatively and quantitatively
stronger [Chinese navy lies in]{.underline} Anti-Access/Area-Denial
([A2/AD)]{.underline} tactics. **[A sizeable fleet of modernized
Taiwanese attack submarines could impose serious costs on Chinese
vessels]{.underline}** operating in the Taiwan Strait, ambushing their
target with close-distance torpedo or anti-ship missile saturation
strikes. [There is a strong precedent for this]{.underline} style of
[asymmetric naval warfare]{.underline} in the form of the Falklands war,
but we need not reach back to the 1980's. Iran is currently pursuing an
analogous submarine-based A2/AD strategy to successfully contest the
Persian Gulf against the much larger and more powerful US navy. Slowly
but surely, Taipei appears to be coming around to the wisdom of
asymmetric submarine warfare. [Seizing on Washington's newfound appetite
for military aid to Taipei, the Taiwanese have taken the major step of
constructing a dedicated submarine production facility]{.underline}. The
factory will be operational next year, with the first prototype of an
indigenously-produced diesel-attack submarine scheduled for 2024.
**[Taipei's]{.underline}** costly, ambitious **[venture was enabled
by]{.underline}** the Trump administration's 2018 **[approval of a
marketing license]{.underline}** for Taiwan **[to procure submarine
components and tech]{.underline}**nology **[from American
manufacturers]{.underline}**. This is a major, if not long overdue,
first step in Taiwan\'s long and difficult road to naval modernization.
**[The project's long-term prospects undoubtedly depend on continued
American military support]{.underline}**, which has historically ebbed
and flowed between administrations. Nonetheless, a **[submarine fleet
geared toward area denial operations is]{.underline}**, and will likely
remain, **[Taiwan's best bet to counter Chinese sea
power]{.underline}**.

Chinese fighter jets, including Sukhoi-30 and Jian-11, flew by the

Western Pacific. Taiwanese warplanes and military vessels shadowed the
fighter jets. On March 31, the island\'s military scrambled fighter
planes after it said two Chinese J-11 fighter jets crossed the border

#### Trump's selling Taiwan F-16 Fighter Jets

Plans to Sell More Than \$2 Billion of Arms to Taiwan", article "The New

PARIS --- The [Trump]{.underline} administration [is
proposing]{.underline} to sell more than [\$2 billion worth
of]{.underline} tanks and other [military equipment to
Taiwan]{.underline}, American officials said on Thursday. The sale would
add to tensions between the United States and China, which are already
clashing over trade, communications technology and a military buildup in
the Pacific region. The sale would be one of the largest to Taiwan in
recent years by the United States. The single costliest part of the
package is 108 M1A2 Abrams tanks, the officials said, and the deal would
also resupply some weapons, including portable anti-tank missile
systems. The United States does not give national recognition to Taiwan,
a de facto independent island off the southeast coast of China that the
Chinese Communist Party intends to bring back eventually under the
control of Beijing, by force if necessary. But the Taiwan Relations Act
obligates the United States government to help Taiwan maintain
self-defense capabilities, and each administration has sold it arms
packages. [The United States is Taiwan's main arms
supplier]{.underline}. The [Taiwan]{.underline} defense ministry
[requested the weapons in the latest package]{.underline}, which was
first reported by Reuters on Wednesday. Congress would have to be
notified of the deal before it could go forward. Trump administration
officials have become increasingly worried about the intentions of
Chinese leaders toward Taiwan, and they also regard Taiwan as an
important counterweight to China in the region. Though China's military
capabilities still lag far behind those of the United States, the
People's Liberation Army has worked on weapons systems, including
anti-ship ballistic missiles, that might prove effective against the
United States Navy in the event of conflict in the Taiwan Strait. In
recent months, the Pentagon has ordered naval ships to sail through the
Taiwan Strait with increasing frequency, in shows of strength that
officials call freedom of navigation exercises. The proposed purchase of
tanks and missiles is consistent with Taiwan's deterrence strategy, said
Bonnie S. Glaser, a senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies. "They would help prevent an invasion, making
it difficult for an invading P.L.A. force to establish a beachhead in
northern Taiwan," she said, referring to the People's Liberation Army.
"[I expect the]{.underline} Trump [administration to approve this
package]{.underline}, [as part of]{.underline} a policy of [bolstering
Taiwan's defenses]{.underline}." She added that [the]{.underline} next
[package]{.underline} was likely to be [for 66 F-16 fighter
jets]{.underline}, a sale that members of Congress have been informed
[is]{.underline} currently [under discussion]{.underline}, according to
an American official.

#### F-16's sold now

Free Beacon. \"Trump Administration Approves Sale of F-16s to Taiwan,\"

AD)

[The Trump administration has approved the sale of dozens of new F-16
jet fighters to Taiwan, the first major warplane sale to the island
state in nearly 30 years. The interagency decision, to be announced in
the near future, authorized the sale of up to 66 F-16V jet fighters at
an estimated cost of \$13 billion,]{.underline} according to
administration officials familiar with internal discussions. The jets
are among several new weapons systems, including missiles, that are part
of the administration\'s latest arms sale to Taiwan, a key U.S. partner
in the Asia Pacific region. The jet sale reverses the Obama
administration rejection of Taiwan\'s request for the same number of
F-15C/D jets over fears of upsetting China. The George W. Bush
administration also blocked F-16 sales in 2007, amid worries about
triggering a backlash from Beijing. A Pentagon spokesman referred
questions about the arms sale to the State Department. A State
Department spokesman said the department does not comment on arms sales
until Congress is first notified. [The jet sale is part of the Trump
administration\'s more hardline policy toward China. Last year,
President Trump signed legislation authorizing greater amounts of
high-level U.S. visits to Taiwan.]{.underline} The arms sales are being
carried out under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act that authorizes the
United States to provide defensive weapons to Taiwan to counter any
mainland attack. The last sale of 150 F-16A/B models took place from
1992 to 1999 under the administration of President George H.W. Bush. As
with the 1992 transfers, the sale is expected to upset Beijing, which
regards Taiwan as a breakaway province and not an independent state.
After a smaller \$330 million arms sale for F-16 spare parts was
announced in September, Beijing spokesmen denounced the weapons
transfers as a violation of U.S.-China agreements. \"The sales severely
violate international law and basic norms governing international
relations, and severely violate the one-China principle as well as the
principles of the three China-U.S. joint communiques,\" Foreign Ministry
spokesman Geng Shuang said, adding that China protested the earlier
sale. The Chinese military protested the sale as interference in
China\'s internal affairs and damaging Chinese sovereignty and security
interests. The official newspaper China Daily stated that same month
that the United States was threatening to cross a \"red line\" with
Taiwan arms sales. The Obama administration sold around \$14 billion in
arms to Taiwan. However, that administration blocked a \$1 billion arms
package in December 2016. In the first two years of the Trump
administration, a total of \$815.5 million in weapons were sold to
Taiwan. The aircraft sale is expected to boost that number to around
\$14 billion. China has stepped up pressure on the island in recent
months by conducting provocative military flights around Taiwan. The
island, located 100 miles from the southern Chinese coast, was set up as
the Republic of China in 1949 when Nationalist forces fled the mainland
during a civil war. The Pentagon 2018 report on the Chinese military
stated that the military balance is shifting in China\'s favor. In terms
of air power, between 2016 and 2017 China added 130 strike aircraft and
bombers, increasing the numbers from 400 to 530. [The jet sales will be
announced amid increasing tensions between Washington and
Beijing.]{.underline} Both remain locked in a trade dispute over
China\'s unfair trade practices and technology theft. Despite several
months of talks and the imposition of tariffs, an agreement resolving
the trade dispute has not materialized. The manufacturer of the F-16V,
Lockheed Martin, describes the aircraft as the most technologically
advanced fourth generation fighter in the world. The first V variant was
flown in 2015. A central feature is the jet\'s Active Electronically
Scanned Array (AESA) radar, an advanced avionics system. Other features
include the capability of carrying advanced missiles, the Sniper
targeting pod and precision GPS navigation. [Taiwan\'s military has said
for more than 10 years that it urgently needs new warplanes to replace
older F-16s and other jets]{.underline}, to upgrade air power. A senior
Taiwan defense official said in December 2009 that new jets are needed
because 10 pilots had been killed in training accidents as a result of
flying older jets. \"Our pilots don\'t mind dying in combat, but they
don\'t want to die in training accidents because their aircraft are too
old,\" the official said. The Obama administration rejected the F-16
request at the time over fears of a disruption in ties. In April, the
U.S. government granted a license to Taiwan permitting technology
transfers that will assist in building its own submarines. Taipei is
currently in the process of designing an indigenous submarine needed to
deter mainland China\'s large naval forces. The U.S. government also
indirectly has assisted Taiwan in building land-attack cruise missiles,
both ground- and air-launched, that can range Chinese cities. After
China began conducting provocative flights near Taiwan, the Pentagon in
January 2018 authorized the sale of 250 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles
to Taiwan. Two senior Republican senators urged the president to sell
new jets last year. \"After years of military modernization, China shows
the ability to wage war against Taiwan for the first time since the
1950s,\" Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas) and Sen. James Inhofe (R., Okla.)
stated in a March 2018 letter. \"However, with your leadership, it is
possible to help Taiwan remain a democracy, free to establish a
relationship with China that is not driven by military coercion. Taiwan
has a legitimate requirement to field a modern fighter fleet to address
a myriad of defense contingencies.\" Cornyn and Inhofe, chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, said if the F-35B could not be
released, then F-16Vs should be sold. New fighters \"will have a
positive impact on Taiwan\'s self-defense and would act as a necessary
deterrent to China\'s aggressive military posture across the
Asia-Pacific region,\" the senators said. Rick Fisher, a senior fellow
at the International Assessment and Strategy Center, said Taiwan is
threatened by advanced jets from China, including stealth fighters, that
justify selling Taiwan more advanced F-35s. \"The administration should
be applauded for selling F-16s to meet an immediate need, but why not
commit the U.S. to victory on the Taiwan Strait?\" Fisher said. \"This
would require selling new long-range, anti-ship and land-attack
missiles, in addition to F-35s. Sure, \[Chinese President\] Xi Jinping
will be mad but will also be better deterred from starting a war that
could result in the collapse of the Chinese Communist Party.\" Defense
journalist Wendell Minnick reported recently that Taiwan chose the F-16V
after abandoning a proposal to buy the more advanced F-35 fifth
generation stealth jet from the United States. Taiwan was seeking the
vertical-takeoff version, the F-35B, but rejected the jet as too costly.
Washington in the past has balked at some arms transfers to Taiwan over
concerns of compromising weapons secrets through Chinese espionage on
the island. As part of its defense modernization, Taiwan also is
upgrading its force of Indigenous Defense Fighters that will give the
jets great weapons-carrying capacity and replace radar and combat
computers. Taiwan\'s fleet of 144 older F-16s have been undergoing
upgrades under a \$3.7 billion arms sale in 2016. The upgrades include
adding advanced radar used on the most modern F-22 and F-35 jets. Taiwan
plans to upgrade the entire F-16 force by 2023. China has deployed a
massive force of an estimated 1,200 ballistic and cruise missiles within
range of Taiwan. In a conflict, China is expected to launched hundreds
of missiles at Taiwan, including its air bases. The Pentagon has been
seeking to end the cumbersome bureaucratic process of selling arms to
Taiwan in large, multi-billion packages. [A new policy would sell needed
arms on a more normal basis similar to transfers with other allies under
the Foreign Military Sales program.]{.underline}

Taiwan said on Saturday that its plan to buy 66 F-16V fighter jets from
the United States remains on course despite reports that Washington has
put the sale on hold pending its trade negotiations with Beijing. A
statement issued by the island's defence ministry said a letter of
request had been sent to the US and that things were proceeding as
normal. The notice came after Time magazine reported on Friday that the
Trump administration had put the sale on ice while negotiators from the
US and China ironed out the final details of their hard-fought trade
agreement. If the deal does go ahead, it would be the first time since
1992 that the US had sold F-16s to Taiwan and would provide a
significant boost to the self-ruled island's defences. Although the US
has a statutory obligation to defend Taiwan, recent administrations have
stopped short of allowing it to buy new fighter jets. [According to
military experts, the new variant of the F-16, the Viper -- which can
carry a wide range of short- and medium-range air-to-air missiles -- is
more able to counter the threat of an air strike from mainland China's
fourth generation aircraft like the Su-35 and J-10.]{.underline} Taiwan,
US planning talks to counter Beijing's thrust for unification Alexander
Huang Chieh-cheng, a former deputy minister of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs
Council, said that with ties between Washington and Taipei stronger than
ever -- and Sino-US relations under pressure -- there had never been a
better time to try and seal the deal. "This is a strategic opportunity
for Taiwan, and Taipei should grab it," he said. "In recent years, as it
has adjusted its Indo-Pacific strategy to counter \[mainland\] China,
the United States has become more friendly towards Taiwan, even though
we all know it's really about Trump's 'America first' policy." [This is
a strategic opportunity for Taiwan, and Taipei should grab
it]{.underline} Alexander Huang, former deputy minister [The first
versions of the single-engine, supersonic multi-role F-16s were made by
General Dynamics -- which later sold its production to Lockheed Martin
-- in the 1970s and joined Taiwan's air force two decades later.
According to military experts, the upgrades to the latest variant put it
on a par with America's fifth generation fighters.]{.underline} For
instance, its AESA (advanced electronically scanned array) radar system
and electronic warfare devices are similar to those found on the F-22
and F-35 fighters flown by the US. The AESA is an all-weather system
that uses hundreds of tiny transmitting and receiving units -- as in the
compound eye of a fly -- to provide high-resolution detection and
imaging of land-based targets. The radar system and electronic warfare
devices on the F-16 Viper are similar to those found on the US' F-22 and
F-35 (pictured) fighters. Photo: Reuters The radar system and electronic
warfare devices on the F-16 Viper are similar to those found on the US'
F-22 and F-35 (pictured) fighters. Photo: Reuters [Andrew Yang Nien-dzu,
a former Taiwanese defence minister, said the Viper's capabilities would
be put to good use in the event of an aerial attack from mainland China.
"The F-16V has some very powerful combat and radar systems," he said.
"For example, its AESA can monitor more than a dozen targets at once,
and would be able to detect a PLA \[People's Liberation Army\] J-20
stealth aircraft at long distance]{.underline}." Yang said that Taipei
originally planned to bolster its air defences with F-35 fighters, but a
huge production backlog meant that even if the US agreed to a deal, the
jets would not be ready for at least a decade. "Because of the growing
security threat from the mainland it \[Taipei\] swapped to the F-16V,"
he said, referring to the increasingly frequent "island encirclement
patrols" conducted by the PLA air force. [Despite the revision, Yang
said the F-16V was a better fit for Taiwan because of its lower
maintenance costs. "Taiwan's air force has 27 years' experience in using
F-16 series aircraft and has developed a comprehensive system for
repairs, logistics and even pilot training]{.underline}," he said. The
F-16V's radar system could detect a PLA J-20 stealth aircraft (pictured)
at long distance, says former Taiwanese defence minister Andrew Yang.

aircraft (pictured) at long distance, says former Taiwanese defence

announced a NT\$110 billion (US\$3.57 billion) programme to have its
existing fleet of 140 F-16s upgraded to the same specification as the
F-16V, with the work expected to be completed by 2022. While the price
of the 66 new models is unknown, Taiwanese media earlier valued the deal
at between US\$7.8 billion and US\$8 billion, and said the jets were
likely to be ready by late 2020. That would put the cost for a single
aircraft in the range of US\$118 million to US\$121 million. US Defence
News reported earlier that Lockheed Martin sold 19 F-16Vs to Bahrain in
2017 for a total cost of almost US\$2.8 billion, or about US\$147
million apiece. While the upgrades and additions to Taiwan's air force
would undoubtedly bolster its fighting capabilities, sealing a deal with
the US on the F-16Vs represented more of a political than a military
victory for Taipei, according to Beijing-based military expert Zhou
Chenming. "Including all versions of the F-16, the indigenous IDF and
the Dassault Mirage 2000, Taiwan has only about 400 fighters," he said.
"How can it compete with the thousands of warplanes the mainland has? In
a war of attrition, victory depends not only on the quality of the
weapons, but also the quantity," he said. Jiao Guoli, a retired senior
colonel from the PLA air force, said the sale of the F-16Vs to Taiwan
was also likely to increase uncertainty in the Taiwan Strait and could
even be the trigger for a military conflict. "The PLA has the resources
to deal with the challenge of dozens of F-16Vs joining Taiwan's air
force and increasing its tactical capabilities," he said. "But as that
challenge grows, so does the tension that is brewing between the two
sides."

[declared](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/t1598615.shtml)
that "the U.S. arms sales to Taiwan severely violates the international
law \[and\] the basic norms governing international relations." The
Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman
[warned](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-09/25/c_137492304.htm)
that the U.S. move severely violated U.S.-China relations, "interfered
with China's domestic affairs and harmed China's sovereignty and
security interests, and seriously damaged China-U.S. ties, relations
between the two militaries, as well as peace and stability across the
Taiwan Strait." The arms sales announcement came not only amid another
round of tariffs in the slowly escalating trade clashes between the
United States and China, but also right after the U.S. imposed sanctions
against the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA). Because the Chinese
purchased Su-35 fighter jets and S-400 surface-to-air missiles from
Russia, the U.S. announced sanctions required by the Countering
America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act of 2017 against the PLA's
Equipment Development Department and its director, Lt. Gen. Li Shangfu.
The Chinese, meanwhile, canceled a meeting between Vice Adm. Shen
Jinlong (head of the Chinese navy) and U.S. Chief of Naval Operations
John Richardson with only 48 hours' notice. They also denied the USS
Wasp access to Hong Kong for a port call. It is unclear whether these
Chinese actions are more in response to the sanctions or the arms sales,
or perhaps the broader deterioration of U.S.-China ties. [The new arms
sales will help Taiwan maintain]{.underline} some semblance of
[credibility in its own defense]{.underline}, [especially in the
air]{.underline}. As [China has increased its pressure on
Taiwan]{.underline} (e.g., employing financial diplomacy [to

Chinese encroachment on it]{.underline}. [If it does not, no one else
will. It also upholds long-standing bipartisan precedent]{.underline},
set by every American president since Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter.
Despite the Chinese Foreign Ministry's obligatory objection to new arms
sales, the United States needs to sustain the diplomatic commitments
maintained by the last nine presidents. After all, America's one-China
policy is for its policymakers, not Chinese officials, to interpret.

[Taiwan\'s fleet of 144 older F-16s have been undergoing upgrades under

deployed a massive force of an estimated 1,200 ballistic and cruise
missiles within range of Taiwan. In a conflict, China is expected to
launched hundreds of missiles at Taiwan, including its air bases. The
Pentagon has been seeking to end the cumbersome bureaucratic process of
selling arms to Taiwan in large, multi-billion packages. A new policy
would sell needed arms on a more normal basis similar to transfers with
other allies under the Foreign Military Sales program.

Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense thanked Washington in a statement
Tuesday, adding that [the latest arms package would help]{.underline} it
[keep peace with China]{.underline}. \"The arms sale indicates strong
concern by the U.S. side toward our security,\" the statement said.
Local defense ministry contractors have stepped up development of
aircraft and missiles, but [Taipei]{.underline} still [relies on U.S.
weaponry for its more advanced systems]{.underline}. China runs the
world's third strongest armed forces, including missiles that Taipei
officials believed are aimed at Taiwan, and this year it announced an
8.1 percent defense budget increase. The type and value of arms in the
sale announced this week probably fall short of a laurel for Taiwan
President Tsai Ing-wen, whose party is campaigning now ahead of mid-term
local elections, said Liu Yih-jiun, professor of public affairs at Fo
Guang University in Taiwan. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-Wen, U.S.
Representative Ed Royce, and U.S. Congresswoman Judy Chu attend the Los
Angeles Overseas Chinese Banquet in Los Angeles, Aug. 12, 2018. But a
longer trend of improved relations with the U.S. government -- from a
\$1.42 billion U.S. arms package announced last year to Tsai's two
high-profile stopovers in U.S. territory last month -- has raised hopes
in Taiwan as China squelches the island's diplomacy with other
countries. Chinese reaction [In China, a military spokesperson said the
armed forces were "strongly dissatisfied with and resolutely opposed to
planned U.S. arms sales to Taiwan]{.underline}," Beijing's official
Xinhua News Agency said Tuesday. The military formally protested to
Washington, Xinhua said. \"Taiwan is a part of China and the one-China
principle is the political foundation of China-U.S. relationship,\" the
spokesperson was quoted saying. But [experts call this type of reaction
pro forma, short of retaliating against]{.underline} either [the
U.S]{.underline}. government [or Taiwan]{.underline}. That's partly
because the sale excludes powerful weapons systems, Liu said. \"[As long
as they don't sell Taiwan some kinds of F-35s and some kinds of most

assistant to President Ronald Reagan, Squaring the U.S., China, Taiwan
Triangle, <http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=13604>; 8-24-11)

Nothing causes greater discord in relations between the United States
and China than the status of Taiwan, officially known as the Republic of
China. However, **[the best way to maintain peace between Washington and
Beijing may be for the U.S. to continue selling weapons to
Taiwan]{.underline}**. Once ruled by imperial China --- but never by
communist China --- the Taiwanese have created a vibrant democracy. Yet
their small nation risks being crushed by Bejing\'s embrace. During the
Cold War, China and Taiwan were bitterly at odds. As China grew
economically and moderated politically, it surged past Taipei on the
international stage. **[Today China is determined to reassert control
over what it views as an errant province]{.underline}**. Even the U.S.
now recognizes only Beijing. However, Washington has promised to sell
Taiwan weapons for its defense. Last year the U.S. announced a \$6.4
billion arms package. The U.S.-China relationship likely will be the
world\'s most important bilateral connection this century. The two
nations are tightly linked economically. They share many other
interests: stability in East Asia, freedom of the seas, open global
economy, cooperative international institutions. Perhaps **[the most
important objective for the existing superpower and the potential
superpower is to avoid conflict.]{.underline}** China has demonstrated
little interest in overseas military expansion or attacking the U.S.
Economic competition between the two is growing in Asia, Africa, and
even South America, but Washington\'s best response would be to
liberalize the U.S. economy, not deploy the Navy. A clash is possible in
East Asia, however. Today the U.S. dominates the region, even along
China\'s border. But China is building deterrent forces, particularly
missiles and submarines capable of sinking U.S. carriers. China poses no
threat to the American homeland. However, Beijing doesn\'t want the U.S.
to be able to threaten its homeland. Imagine if the Chinese Navy was
patrolling America\'s coasts, prepared to intervene in, say,
Washington\'s struggle with Hawaiian secessionists. Since it is far
cheaper to build defensive than offensive weapons, America could
bankrupt itself buying additional platforms in order to maintain its
ability to attack the Chinese mainland. Nevertheless, Washington should
not abandon Taiwan. The island is entitled to decide its own destiny.
Beijing is not justified in trying to coerce the Taiwanese people. The
best solution would be a negotiated settlement. The two states and
peoples have drawn steadily closer. However, China will make itself
politically attractive only when it accepts a free society as well as a
freer economy. In the meantime, the U.S. should authorize arms sales
which enable the island to maintain a military deterrent just as China
is building a deterrent to America. Taipei should not \"try to match the
PRC (China) ship for ship, plane for plane, or missile for missile,\"
argued the Washington-based Taiwan Policy Working Group. Rather, Taipei
should build a small but deadly force capable of exacting a high price
from any attackers. Last year\'s weapons package included Harpoon and
Patriot missiles, mine-detection ships, Blackhawk helicopters, and
communications equipment. Washington put off any decision on advanced
F-16s and diesel submarines. But **[Taiwan is now pressing
for]{.underline}** the **[fighters]{.underline}**. The Obama
administration reportedly has decided to refuse to supply the most
advanced aircraft. China might retaliate diplomatically. However,
**[empowering Taiwan is worth risking tenser relations with
China]{.underline}**. After all, **[arms sales do not put America and
China on a path to war]{.underline}**. **[Rather, they create a
disincentive for Beijing to consider war as an option]{.underline}**.
That\'s why a reasonable **[accommodation]{.underline}** between China
and Taiwan **[is more likely if Taipei possesses the ability to defend
itself]{.underline}**. Taiwanese officials repeatedly made this point on
my recent visit. Vice Defense Minister Andrew N.D. Yang said the
objective is to create a force that tells China: \"Don\'t mess with us,
for you will pay a big price if you do.\" Ambassador Stephen S.F. Chen,
now at the National Policy Foundation, noted that **[better aircraft
would increase Taiwan\'s bargaining power:]{.underline}** \"when we
enter into political negotiations with the mainland we need to go into
negotiations from a position of strength.\" Of course, Taipei should not
be purely reliant on America. Taiwan recently deployed its third
generation of Brave Wind anti-ship missiles. Taipei also is considering
production of the Hsiung Feng-2E ballistic missile. Even a small
strategic deterrent would force China to hesitate before threatening
Taiwan. Washington should help Taipei defend itself. Peace is in the
interest of Taiwan, China and the U.S. Washington should maintain a good
relationship with China. And continuing **[arms sales to Taipei may be
the best means to preserve stability and peace across the Taiwan
Strait]{.underline}**.

Hopkins University, The hidden costs of defense cuts, New York Post,

**[The Defense Department recently confirmed that it's blocking the sale
of]{.underline}** 66 **[F-16 C/D fighters that Taiwan had wanted to
buy]{.underline}** to update its air force. The repercussions may
surprise you. The move was no great surprise: Red China has been making
a rumpus about the promised sale for months, even threatening in a
People's Daily editorial to use "the financial weapon" in retaliation if
the sale went through \-- and what America's biggest debt holder wants,
it's bound to get. Besides, the F-16s were going to be built in Texas,
not exactly this administration's favorite state. The Pentagon is trying
to soften the blow by offering an upgrade package for the F-16s Taiwan
already has. But everyone knows this is a major setback for relations
between us and one of our traditional allies in Asia. "We're so
disappointed in the United States," one Taiwan official said. But
**[blocking the sale]{.underline}** doesn't just hurt a friend in need.
It also **[limits our own power projection in the Pacific
region]{.underline}** \-- precisely why Beijing has been so adamant
about stopping the sale. **[And it's going to cost American jobs, and
deal a sharp blow to one of our biggest and most beleaguered defense
contractors]{.underline}**. It may even hurt our own future defense
capabilities, for reasons few policy-makers understand when they talk
about big budget cuts at the Pentagon. The F-16 is this country's
principal export fighter, seeing service in more than 20 air arms around
the world. The \$8.7 billion sale would have included the Pentagon's 3.8
percent surcharge on all military hardware sales to foreign countries.
That's real money in its pocket, not just another congressional
authorization. Or would have been \-- because now, wherever Taiwan does
decide to buy its new fighters, it won't be in the United States. In
addition, **[building those 66 planes would've kept Lockheed
Martin's]{.underline}** Dallas-Fort Worth F-16 **[production line
running]{.underline}** at capacity, helping to lower the price tag of
the F-16s Iraq and Oman have announced they are thinking of buying \--
**[and meant adding new assembly line and engineering
jobs]{.underline}**. **[Then the hundreds of subcontractors in 44 states
that supply parts, engines, and electronic systems for the Fighting
Falcon would've been adding new workers \-- by one published estimate,
as many as 87,000.]{.underline}** Add in the \$768 million in federal
tax revenue Lockheed and those subcontractors would have paid, and the
lost opportunities begin to add up. Now, killing the deal could cost
2,000 existing jobs, at an aviation company still reeling from Obama's
cancellation of its F-22 Raptor program and thousands of layoffs last
month. But the costs of cancellation don't stop there. **[Lockheed
Martin continually upgrades the US Air Force's own F-16s, and keeping
the production line going helps to lower those costs and maintains
efficient upgrade capabilities. Now those planes may
suffer]{.underline}**, as well \-- or cost millions more to add new
systems. If an angry Taiwan turns down the upgrade offer on new radar
and missile systems which our planes also use, that'll be still another
blow to hopes of keeping our own F-16s combat effective and in the air.
**[Loss of jobs, loss of revenue, loss of capabilities, and loss of
face]{.underline}**: It's a preview what America can look forward to
with other weapons programs if current plans to cut the Pentagon budget
by \$900 billion over 10 years go forward, **[leaving a ripple effect
through the economy but also in our force effectiveness]{.underline}**.
Republicans in Congress agreed to those plans with President Obama.
Perhaps, under a new, Republican president (especially if he happens to
come from Texas), they might reverse this disastrous and
self-destructive course, and not just on the Taiwan sale. Some skeptics
think the deal is dead. In dealing with Obama, "Beijing's kung fu is
better than Washington's \[meaning Congress'\]," is the way one attendee
at the Taipei Aerospace and Defense Technology Exhibition put it. We'll
see. In the meantime, our current defense policy seems to be largely
shooting ourselves in the foot \-- again.

one of its most sensitive issues. "**[These fighters will have a

respond to a request for comment. China has been increasing its military
exercises around Taiwan and making markedly stronger public comments
about the need to prevent Taiwan independence. On Tuesday, retired
Chinese general Wang Hongguang explained how easy it would be for China
to attack Taiwan in an opinion piece in widely read state-run newspaper
the Global Times, including a mass bombardment which would render
Taiwan's military inoperable within 48 hours. Taiwan's main command

The F-35 is important not only to southern Maryland. In Baltimore, Joel
Signor runs Resco Defense, an independent supplier and distributor. He
supplies the widgets that go into the horizontal iPad-like control panel
in the jet's cockpit. "We're shipping material for new production" of
the F-35, Signor said. "So, we're shipping directly to Mitsubishi or
directly to Northrop Grumman. Then they're taking these components and
assembling the next higher assemblies that will eventually someday find
their way into an aircraft." Resco is a small business, but the hype
around **[the fighter jet has]{.underline}** helped **[the company more
than double its workforce]{.underline}** from 10 to 22 employees in a
year **[and increase revenue from \$10 to \$25 million in a
decade]{.underline}**. Signor is also proud of his company for being in
a Historically Underutilized Business Zone \[HUB Zone\] in southwest
Baltimore. Signor says that means his company is injecting much needed
economic growth into the city and 35 percent of his employees are from
the surrounding neighborhood of Pigtown. "I don't focus necessarily on
people who have experience in a particular field or even has been in the
industry or has a college degree," Signor said. "We try to be open and
evaluate everyone based on their skills and, more importantly, their
attitude toward work." The F-35 program makes up 14 percent of Resco's
profits. Signor says they want to keep growing as Lockheed Martin looks
to produce 135 new jets in 2019. "The program is in its early stages, so
it looks like they're going to be around for a long time," Signor said.
"Hopefully till well after I retire." And that's the prognosis from Wall
Street as well. "Within the next three to five years, there certainly
seems to be upward pressure on annual deliveries and production rates
based on growing demand internationally," says Aerospace Defense Analyst
Joseph DeNardi with Baltimore-based financial services firm Stifel.
DeNardi predicts production of the plane could grow to 180 a year over
the next few years with countries like Australia, Turkey, and Japan
ramping up their F-35 programs for a variety of reasons. "It's a number
of different factors," DeNardi said. "The threat environment, which is
very high. \[**[And\] performance of the aircraft relative to
expectation]{.underline}**, which I think **[has been
good]{.underline}**." For Lockheed Martin, to get to this point of
expansion hasn't been easy. In 2016, during the initial testing phase of
the aircraft, the late U.S. Sen. John McCain called the program, "both a
scandal and a tragedy with respect to cost, schedule, and performance."
Last October, an F-35 crashed during a flight at Fort Beaufort in South
Carolina. The cause of the crash is still under investigation, but due
to the incident all jets were grounded and inspected for possible faulty
engine tubes. And last month, Lockheed Martin's first quarter profits of
the plane were below expectation. But DeNardi gives Lockheed Martin's
publicly traded stock a "buy" rating now. "I think the fact that they
were able to identify the cause gave us a little more confidence that it
is not going to be a reoccurring problem for the program," he said. And
that means the production of fighter jets in Maryland will continue for
the foreseeable future.

The six-year-old **[F-35 fighter jet]{.underline}** is the newest
military aircraft to roll out of Bethesda-based Lockheed Martin. While
the jet has been ridiculed as the most expensive defense program in U.S.
history, the plane **[is expected to add \$2 billion to Maryland's
economy over the next decade]{.underline}**, **[and almost 6,000
civilian and military jobs to the region]{.underline}**. Dressed in an
army-green jumpsuit, Billie Flynn tests F-35 fighter jets around the
Chesapeake Region. "I grew up around fighter jets," Flynn said. "My
father was a fighter pilot, so early in life I knew I wanted to fly."
Flynn is a veteran pilot with the Integrated Test Force at the Naval Air
Base in Patuxent River, Maryland. He admits testing a new aircraft like
the F-35 can be dangerous. "There is risk, but we're smart enough to try
and contain that," Flynn said. "And the fascination about finding new
things about aviation never ends." The jet costs \$89 million. Its
stealth capabilities and sensor fusion, which allows pilots to draw on
all of the plane's sensors and see the entire battlefield, are the two
characteristics that differentiate the F-35 from its predecessors, the
F-22 and F-18. "It's like Harry Potter's cloak of invisibility," said
Flynn, describing the plane's stealth mode. "It really is omnipotence.
It is flying with impunity because you know that no one can ever see you
and you can see everyone." Inside the plane, an F-35 pilot wears a
\$400,000 helmet. Just like with the helmet Iron Man Tony Stark wears in
"The Avengers" movies, the pilot can see everything outside the plane
thanks to its sensor fusion. "And here in Maryland, that means we can
see all the angulations of the coastline of the Chesapeake Bay," Flynn
said. "I can see all the fields that are plowed, all the highways, all
the power lines, all the boats, and the ships, and barges moving up and
down the Chesapeake." It's the next generation of military aircraft.
"It's built for a generation of kids --- men and women --- who spent far
too much time on video games," Flynn said. "\[It's\] more of an appetite
for a younger generation that don't have the habits of last generation's
fighters." The Naval Air Station in Patuxent River has a long history in
the state testing Marine Corps and Navy airplanes and helicopters. It's
one of two places in the U.S. that tests aircraft. It has been doing so
since 1937. "**[As we continue to refine and expand what the F-35 can
do, we're going to have a tremendous number of men and women
contributing to the F-35 for decades to come]{.underline}** here
**[in]{.underline}** southern **[Maryland]{.underline}**," Flynn said.

On the Kinmen Island only a few miles east of mainland China, Taiwan
deploys anti-ship missiles, surface-to-surface missiles, monitoring
radar and remote howitzers. Among these arms directly pointing at China,
the most advanced ones are from the United States. [Every round of U.S.
eye-catching and pricy arms package sales to Taiwan irritates
China]{.underline}. These sales of advanced armaments lead to intense
condemnation of Washington and sanctions against U.S. companies.
[However]{.underline}, [by changing current arms package sales to the
approach of a steady stream of small deals]{.underline}, [the

and better fulfill its security commitment to Taiwan. The U.S. has sold
arms to Taiwan since establishing diplomatic relations with the People's
Republic of China. These arms sales help the U.S. to fulfill the
security commitment to the island based on the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act
(TRA). However, with the current approach, the U.S. is failing to help
Taiwan to deter China, and also risks U.S.-Taiwan-China trilateral
relations. Instead, **[the U.S. can sell more arms]{.underline}**,

[Bolster U.S. credibility]{.underline}. China's severe complaints about
U.S. arms sales raise insecurity and doubts not only in Taiwan, but also

suggested approach---selling more arms, but below the radar --- the
United States can uphold its security commitments as well as
international obligations. It will significantly enhance U.S.
credibility in the region, especially among U.S. allies. [Stabilize
U.S.-Taiwan-China trilateral relations]{.underline}. [Smaller arms
deals]{.underline} between the U.S. and Taiwan [are much less likely to
irritate China]{.underline}. [China will find it difficult to impose
severe sanctions because of an arms deal only worth millions of
dollars]{.underline}. The U.S. has been balancing between China and
Taiwan since 1979, and has successfully avoided significant conflict
across the strait. Peace has provided the environment for the growth of
Taiwan's democracy, as well as the vast increase of trade between the
U.S. and China. This policy will help the U.S. to maintain the status
quo. [Secure Taiwan and its democracy]{.underline}. **[The increased
number of arms sold will equip Taiwan with better capability to deter
China]{.underline}**. If China were to conduct an attack, Taiwan would
be able to resist longer before the U.S. came to rescue. Facing the
rapid rise of Chinese military power and the prospect of decreased U.S.
arms sales, Taiwan has become more and more vulnerable against China.
This policy will help to secure Taiwan and its democracy. How can the
U.S. implement this policy effectively? [The U.S. can reach a private
agreement on larger multi-year deals with Taiwan]{.underline}, in order
to keep arms production lines open. However, [public announcements of
arms agreements should be small and incremental]{.underline}. Like past
arms deals, [the arms sales under this policy can be operated by the
Defense Security Cooperation Agency in the Department of
Defense]{.underline}. Even though there is a chance that China may find
out about the private agreement, it will be hard for China to create a
pretext for war building on rumors. The U.S. has been keeping "a robust
unofficial relationship" with Taiwan for decades. This relationship has
assisted the "Taiwan Economic Miracle" in the 1980s, promoted Taiwan's
democratization in the 1990s, and secured the well-being and confidence
of Taiwanese people in the 21st century. U.S. support underpins Taiwan's
sovereignty and democracy, and arms sales are the central element of
that support. Moreover, the U.S. security commitment to Taiwan is vital
to the geopolitical balance in East Asia, hence crucial to the U.S. and
its allies' security. With this increased yet less risky arms sale
approach to Taiwan, the U.S. will be able to not only secure Taiwan and
its allies in East Asia, but also the U.S. homeland. Last but not least,
it will help the U.S. to preserve both the reality and its image as a
world leader and guardian of democracy.

### Normalization Solves Relations 

#### Squo arms packages aggravate china -- regularization is key

University, "How to Sell Arms to Taiwan" 9/2/16, accessed 6/24/19,

Imagine that in 2020, [China learns]{.underline} that [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will soon deliver an unusually
large and comprehensive arms package to Taiwan]{.underline}. [Determined
to continue growing its military advantage -- and therefore its leverage
-- vis-à-vis Taiwan, China declares a red line against the delivery,
threatening severe consequences]{.underline} if the United States
proceeds. That announcement ignites a standoff in the Taiwan Strait.
Each side mobilizes its forces and prepares for the possibility of armed
conflict. [This hypothetical scenario captures one of the most likely
crises that could break out between China and the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates in the coming years. Because Sino-American
relations may come to define the international landscape of the 21st
Century, it is essential to anticipate and, if possible, avert exactly
this sort of flare-up, which could divert that critical relationship
down the wrong path. Fortunately, this particular danger is largely
preventable through subtle changes in policy that require no major
sacrifices to the American national interest. [To avoid a future crisis
with China over arms sales]{.underline}, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [should dispense with the "arms package" approach
to arms sales to Taiwan]{.underline} and instead [conduct]{.underline}
the [sales in a steady stream of small increments.]{.underline}
Nobel-prize winning strategist Thomas Schelling coined [the
term]{.underline} "**[salami tactics]{.underline}**" [to describe this
approach]{.underline}, a reference to slicing off an objective in a
series of gradual steps rather than all at once. Using [salami tactics
does not mean selling fewer arms.]{.underline} It means spreading out
the same sales across a series of [transactions that are each
individually too small to provoke a violent Chinese
response.]{.underline} This approach would have [two core principles: no
large arms packages, no long lulls between arms sales]{.underline}.
Adopting salami tactics would represent a marked change in U.S. policy.
In 1992, the George H. W. Bush Administration approved an arms package
that included 150 F-16A/B fighters, exactly the sort of unusually large
package that could one day trigger a crisis with an increasingly
powerful and assertive China. [More recent arms packages have been
smaller, but still larger than necessary]{.underline}. In 2008, the
United States announced \$6.5 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, a package
that included Patriot missiles, Apache attack helicopters, and upgrades
to the Taiwanese Air Force's F-16s and F-5s. In protest, China suspended
military-to-military ties with the United States. In 2010, President
Obama approved another \$6 billion package featuring Patriot missiles,
Blackhawk helicopters, Harpoon anti-ship missiles, and additional F-16
upgrades. China condemned the sales and sanctioned some participating
U.S companies. In 2014, the United States approved the sale of four
Perry-class frigates. It is currently common practice to announce up to
several years' worth of sales together. Last December, the United States
announced a \$1.83 billion arms package for Taiwan that included two
Perry-class frigates, amphibious assault vehicles, anti-tank missiles,
surface-to-air missiles, and upgrades to a variety of other weapon
systems. Predictably, China objected, with a spokesman declaring, "We
resolutely oppose sales of weaponry or military technology to Taiwan by
any country in any form or using any excuse." [China has yet to put its
full power behind attempting to halt an arms sale, but that may change
as China begins to flex its newfound muscles.]{.underline} The question
is: why combine these sales into one larger package that is so much more
likely to provoke a stronger Chinese response? Adopting salami tactics
would have meant splitting up the sales into multiple transactions
announced and delivered separately, bringing the price tag for each well
below \$1 billion. There is simply no need to treat as one package a set
of unrelated weapon systems. Indeed, there is no need to sell large
numbers of the same weapon system all at once. [Salami tactics can help
to avoid a crisis in which China learns of an impending arms deal and
declares a red line against it]{.underline}. [China would find it
difficult to threaten war over the sale of a few surface-to-air missiles
or a single frigate]{.underline}, especially after tolerating a similar
delivery only months beforehand. How could such a large threat be
credible for such a small infraction? Rather than declare a red line it
cannot enforce over yet another modest and ordinary sale, China would
more likely opt not to set one at all. Just as important as avoiding
large arms packages is avoiding long periods without any arms sales. [A
prolonged suspension of arms sales]{.underline}, even one that begins
for reasons other than assuaging China, [will gradually solidify into a
precedent]{.underline}. Once a no-sales precedent is in place, [then
even a small sale after ten years of none will become more provocative
than it would be today]{.underline}. China might seriously consider
accepting grave risks to uphold a new status quo of zero arms sales to
Taiwan. Taiwan will sometimes need to quietly agree to larger multi-year
deals so that U.S. arms manufacturers know, for instance, to keep a
particular production line open. However, when this proves unavoidable,
the United States can still announce and deliver these sales in
increments. Because China would find it difficult to threaten to go to
war in response to rumors or media reports of private U.S.-Taiwan
arrangements, China is far more likely to make any red lines contingent
on announcements or, more likely, actual deliveries. In short, to adopt
salami tactics would mean choosing strategic benefits over
administrative and commercial inconveniences. [The key to the salami
tactics approach is avoiding any single act that so harms Chinese
interests]{.underline} -- as defined by Beijing -- that China would
seriously consider using or threatening force to prevent it. Right now,
[U.S. policy draws too heavily on the arms package approach and
consequently risks just that.]{.underline} Opportunities to prevent
serious crises without sacrificing the national interest do not come
along often. It is vital to take advantage of them.

### Incrementalism Solves

#### It solves and enables the US to monitor the PRCs intentions in real-time

Eric **Gomez** is a policy analyst in defense and foreign policy studies
at the Cato Institute **2016** A Costly Commitment: Options for the
Future of the U.S.-Taiwan Defense Relationship September 28, 2016
https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/costly-commitment-options-future-us-taiwan-defense-relationship#full

How the United States goes about stepping down from its commitment is
important. Suddenly abrogating the TRA would be practically impossible
given the entrenched support for Taiwan within Congress. **[The most
realistic]{.underline}**, feasible **[approach requires incremental
reductions in U.S. support for Taiwan]{.underline}**. Examples of such
reductions could include setting a cap on the value and/or quality of
military equipment that can be sold to Taiwan, changing the TRA to more
narrowly define what constitutes a threat to Taiwan, or requiring Taiwan
to spend a certain percentage of its GDP on defense in order to receive
U.S. military support. [Incremental reduction would be easier to sell to
U.S. policymakers]{.underline} [because it buys time for Taiwan to
improve its defenses,]{.underline} thus [increasing the credibility of
the island's military deterrent]{.underline}. As discussed earlier,
Taiwan's defense industries have proven they can make high-quality
military equipment that meets the island's defense needs. T[aiwan has
the ability to develop a robust and effective military deterrent, but it
needs time to overcome existing challenges]{.underline} and address
unforeseen obstacles. [If the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[were to reduce its commitment incrementally, Taiwan's political and
military leadership would have the time to address such
challenge]{.underline}s. [Incremental implementation]{.underline} of
this policy option [would]{.underline} [also provide the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [with opportunities to learn
about Chinese intentions, based on Beijing's reaction]{.underline}.66
[Stepping down from the defense commitment]{.underline} to Taiwan [would
be a]{.underline} major accommodation on a core Chinese security
interest. American policymakers should demand some sort of reciprocal
actions from Beijing that reduce the military threat the PLA poses to
Taiwan. In Meeting China Halfway, Lyle J. Goldstein explains how
"[cooperation spirals" in the U.S.-China relationship can build "trust
and confidence]{.underline} ... [over time through incremental and
reciprocal steps that gradually lead to larger and more significant
compromises]{.underline}."67 However, [if Washington takes accommodating
policy positions and Beijing responds with obstinacy or increased
aggression, then American policymakers would likely want to adjust their
approach]{.underline}. Stepping down from the U[.S. defense commitment
to Taiwan]{.underline}, regardless of how it is implemented, [is a
controversial policy option that would face significant
opposition]{.underline}. However, there is a strong case to be made for
the benefits of such a policy. Taiwan's fate carries much more
significance for China than the United States, and American military
superiority over China is eroding. Although Taiwan faces serious
challenges, it would be capable of maintaining a military deterrent
without American support, especially given the other factors that rein
in Chinese aggression. A self-defense strategy emphasizing asymmetric
warfare could raise the costs of military conflict for China to
unacceptably high levels. Most important, the risk of armed conflict
between the United States and China would be significantly reduced.

## \*\*\* Containment

### 1NC -- Containment Turn

#### We are at a crossroads -- China is counterbalancing the US now but they are restrained by US arms sales -- the plan reverses that 

**Wilson 6-11**-2019, Jeanne L. Wilson has a PhD from Indiana
University, "Are Russia and China Revisionist States?", article
"University of Nottingham Asia Research Institute", \[6/27/2019\],
https://theasiadialogue.com/2019/06/11/are-russia-and-china-revisionist-states/

In the past few years, Russia and China have increasingly been referred
to as revisionist powers. For example, both the United States' 2017
National Security Strategy and the United States' 2018 National Defence
Strategy identify Russia and China as revisionist states. The concept of
revisionism encompasses various meanings that typically distinguish
between states that accept the status quo distribution of power in the
international system and those which seek to alter it to their
advantage. Here, I am primarily concerned with the extent to which
Russia and China challenge the implicit assumptions that underpin the
norms and values of what might be referred to as the international
community in the English School sense of the term. I argue that [Russia
and China are]{.underline} not revisionist but rather [neo-revisionist
states. However]{.underline}, it is [China]{.underline} rather than
Russia that [is]{.underline} more [likely]{.underline} substantively
[to]{.underline} challenge the status quo and [assume the position of a
full-blown revisionist power in the future.]{.underline} Both Western
[analysts and policymakers have identified]{.underline} a litany of
Russian and C[hinese behaviour that indicates nonconformance
to]{.underline} what is portrayed as [universal norms]{.underline} and
values. In fact, Russia and China contest a set of neoliberal practices
that have evolved in the post-World War Two international order.
Foremost amongst these is the evolution of human rights as a universal
value that legitimizes intervention in the domestic affairs of a
sovereign state (although Russia has made use of the rhetoric of the
"responsibility to protect" to justify its activities in the post-Soviet
space). Russia and [China]{.underline} similarly [view the]{.underline}
West's [elevation of liberal democracy]{.underline} as a universal ideal
[as a subterfuge for the fomenting of Colour Revolutions that seek
regime change in noncompliant targeted states]{.underline}. At the same
time, Russia and China accept and in fact continuously reaffirm their
commitment to a number of fundamental precepts of the international
order. These include the primacy of state sovereignty and territorial
integrity, the importance of international law, and the centrality of
the United Nations, particularly with respect to the key role of the
United Nations Security Council. It must be acknowledged that Russian
and Chinese promotion of these concepts does not necessarily provide a
reliable guide to their foreign policy behaviour (although the same
criticism can be lodged against countless other states). Russia and
China also actively participate in aspects of global governance, placing
an emphasis on the United Nations as the ultimate source of
international authority. Both states have signed a number of United
Nations Conventions and Covenants including the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights. They are members of a number of
multilateral and regional structures (although Russia has been suspended
from participation in the G-7). The two states stress their commitment
to the maintenance of global and regional security supporting the
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the non-militarization of space,
and the need to fight terrorism. Critically, Russia and China act as
rule takers rather than challengers in their participation in the global
financial institutions. China, in particular, has emerged as a vocal
supporter of globalization and free trade in conspicuous contrast to the
United States in the Trump administration. Russia and China's view of
the operation of the international system conforms in a large part to
Westphalian precepts, while rejecting the West's more recent adoption of
humanitarian and individualistic norms and values (which in fact exist
in a state of uneasy tension with the traditional assumptions of the
Westphalian order). In this sense, Russia and China are neo-revisionist
rather than revisionist states. Under the Xi Jinping leadership[, China
has adopted a more assertive foreign policy that]{.underline}, in
contrast to the behaviour of past leadership, [confidently asserts
China's status as a great power]{.underline}. On the one hand, this is
reflected in the State's efforts to readjust China's role in
international structures, as seen in the attempt to expand its
decision-making power within the International Monetary Fund. This sort
of behaviour, however, takes place within the boundaries of the
contemporary international community. On the other hand,
[China's]{.underline} launching of the [Belt and Road
Initiative]{.underline} (BRI) in 2013 [can be viewed as]{.underline}
offering [an alternative vision of global governance that challenges the
approach promoted by the hegemonic Western powers]{.underline}. Beijing
has offered a number of rationales for BRI which are in themselves at
least in part persuasive. This massive infrastructure project can be
seen as a means of developing China's Western regions, utilizing surplus
capital and providing employment, extending Chinese export markets, and
securing domestic energy supplies. Generally speaking, the Chinese
leadership has sought to downplay the strategic and geopolitical
implications of BRI. In fact, the BRI is closely associated with two
rather amorphous concepts: the "Community of Common Destiny" (minyun
gongtongti) and the "Silk Road Spirit" (silu Jingshen). The Community of
Common Destiny relies on a sort of updating of Confucianism (that is
also reminiscent of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence) to
stress mutual benefit, friendship, equality, and win-win outcomes. [The
Silk Road]{.underline} Spirit provides a parallel emphasis on
inclusivity that emphasizes the right of all states to choose their own
social systems, [a pointed rejection of the democracy and human rights
agenda of the hegemonic West.]{.underline} [Although the]{.underline}
initial [focus of BRI]{.underline} and the Community of Common Destiny
[is regional]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} long-term [implications are
global]{.underline}. The BRI and the Community of Common Destiny
potentially posit a Sinocentric global community that locates China at
its epicentre. Whereas [Russia lacks]{.underline} the material
[capabilities to propose an alternative framework]{.underline} to the
contemporary global system, [such restrictions do not apply to
China]{.underline}. To be sure, the success of the BRI is by no means
assured but the project has multiple adverse implications to the
continued ability of the West to set the rules of discourse and
behaviour in the international community. The Western response to a
rising China has largely been an effort to socialize China into the
norms and values of the US-led international order. But [China
increasingly possesses the potential ability to remake the international
community in its own image. To do so would indicate China's true status
as a revisionist power.]{.underline}

#### Appeasement undermines U.S. primacy, causes war

**Tellis 14** (Ashely, Carnegie senior associate, "Balancing Without
Containment", 1-22,

[This transition will not occur automatically if China's GNP one day
exceeds that of the United States. Rather, the threat of [supersession
will be]{.mark} more [gradual as]{.mark} continuing [Chinese economic
growth]{.mark}]{.underline}---at levels superior to the expansion
occurring in the United States--- [steadily [enables Beijing to
acquire]{.mark} all the other accoutrements that make for
[comprehensive]{.mark} national [power]{.mark}. On current trends, China
will consistently accumulate these capabilities over the next two
decades]{.underline}. It certainly aims to do so, at the latest, by
2049, the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of
China and the date by which Chinese President Xi Jinping has declared
China's intention to become a fully developed nation. [Acquiring the
appropriate foundations of power will position China to achieve, first,
strategic equivalence with the United States, thus transforming the
international system into a meaningfully bipolar order. Then, depending
on Beijing's own fortunes, [China]{.mark} [may]{.mark} possibly [surpass
Washington as the center of gravity in international politics]{.mark}.
Irrespective of which outcome occurs---or when---either eventuality
[would]{.mark} by definition [signal the demise of]{.mark} the
[primacy]{.mark} that the United States has enjoyed since the end of the
Second World War.]{.underline} Even if during this process a power
transition in the strict vocabulary of realist international relations
theory is avoided---a possibility because China's per capita income will
lag behind that of the United States for a long time even if it acquires
the world's largest GNP---[[Beijing's capacity to challenge]{.mark}
[Washington]{.mark}'s interests in multiple arenas, ranging from
geopolitics to trade and from advancing human rights to protecting the
commons, [will]{.mark} only [increase as]{.mark} its [power
expands]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words, China will demonstrate how
a rival can, as Thomas J. Christensen phrased it, "\[pose\] problems
without catching up."8 \<end page 3\> As Avery Goldstein has
persuasively argued, [**these [hazards could materialize]{.mark} rather
[quickly]{.mark}** [because China is]{.mark} currently [pursuing
provocative policies on territorial disputes]{.mark} over islands in the
East and South China Seas]{.underline}.9 That these disputes, which a
former U.S. official described as involving "uninhabited and
uninhabitable rocks,"10 do not appear prima facie to implicate a
systemic crisis should not be reassuring to the United States because
[every serious contestation that occurs in future Sino-American
relations will materialize against the backdrop of a possible power
transition so long as China's growth rates---even when
diminishing---continue to exceed those of the United States.
[This]{.mark} [dynamic]{.mark}]{.underline}, as William R. Thompson has
pointed out, [can produce extended "crisis slides" in which even
"relatively trivial incidents or a string of seemingly minor crises"
[may]{.mark} suffice to **[escalate]{.mark}** what was up to that point
a precarious structural transformation [**into full-fledged**
geopolitical polarization and **major w**]{.mark}**ar**]{.underline}.11
Since the relative disparity in Sino-American economic performance is
likely to persist for quite some time, [[even]{.mark} trifling [quarrels
will push bilateral ties]{.mark} ever more concertedly [in the direction
of]{.mark} greater [abrasion]{.mark} as accumulating Chinese power
further constrains U.S. freedom of action]{.underline}. AN UNPRECEDENTED
CHALLENGE In many ways, [the challenge posed by China will be more
serious than that posed by the previous American competitor---the Soviet
Union]{.underline}. While the Soviet Union was indeed a formidable
military power, its economic base was always much smaller than that of
the United States. Although insufficiently appreciated during the Cold
War, [the Soviet Union was actually a deformed entity: a military giant
possessing coercive capabilities that rivaled the United States but an
economic midget nurturing a productive base that was less than half the
size of its avowed competitor]{.underline}.12 Angus Maddison, for
example, has estimated that the gross domestic product (GDP) of the
Soviet Union, when at the height of its relative power in 1975, was
approximately 44.4 percent of that of the United States in the same
year. [China does not share this weakness, which makes the dangers posed
by its ascent--- and the prospect that it will one day acquire genuinely
comprehensive power rivaling that of the United States---far more
problematic.]{.underline} Furthermore, China's central location within
the larger concentration of Asian economic power---the fastest-growing
hub in the international system---endows its growth with even greater
significance. There is a risk that Beijing might someday exercise
choking control over this critical geopolitical space and thereby
endanger larger American and global security.13 Today, even before China
has completely risen, it is already committed to the objective of
enforcing a strict hierarchy in Asia, meaning that Beijing's position at
the top of the continental order is acknowledged and respected by all
its neighbors. As François Godement has pointed out, [Chinese strategy
for securing such primacy has revolved around translating]{.underline}
\<END PAGE 4\> [the massive economic gains it has made in recent years
into a geopolitical approach]{.underline} that emphasizes "coercion
without force."14 Even more astutely, Christopher Ford has noted that
"the 'thorough submission' of other countries" that China seeks is meant
to be voluntary--- that is, these countries "would be expected not to
have to be forced to comply, but rather spontaneously to choose to take
their place within the status-hierarchy under the benevolent guidance of
the virtuous leader."15 This is the only explanation that does justice
to then Chinese foreign minister Yang Jiechi's outburst at the 2010
meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations when, staring
directly at Singapore's then foreign minister, George Yeo, he bluntly
declared that "China is a big country and other countries are small
countries, and that's just a fact."16 Just in case Beijing's neighbors
do not get the message, however, China has begun to put in place the
foundations for enforcing its own version of the Monroe Doctrine along
its various peripheries. Beginning with "cartographic aggression"17
through claims such as its "9-dash line" in the South China Sea and its
expansive assertions along the Sino-Indian border to further efforts at
"national enclosure"18 through its recently expanded air defense
identification zone in the East China Sea to mounting "the world's
biggest military expansion" 19 for several years running, [China is
systematically laying the foundations to ensure that its neighbors
acquiesce to its burgeoning hegemony while simultaneously ensuring their
isolation vis-à-vis their most important external protector, namely the
United States.]{.underline} To be sure, China does not yet pose the kind
of military threats to Asia that the Soviet Union posed to Europe in its
heyday. This condition, however, may not last for long given that
China's relations with its neighbors are troubled in many ways.
[Disputes over continental and maritime boundaries persist, status
rivalries between China and its Asian peers have not disappeared, and
Beijing has, at least so far, studiously refused to renounce the use of
force in resolving geopolitical disagreements at a time when its own
capacity to mount significant standoff attacks on adjacent countries is
rapidly growing]{.underline}. Consequently, however remote the prospect
may seem at present, the United States could find itself in a conflict
with China in the future thanks to its extended deterrence obligations
to various Asian nations. Conflicts between China and its neighbors that
do not directly involve the United States but nevertheless affect U.S.
interests are also possible. On balance, both these contingencies have
inevitably impelled China "to expand and rapidly accelerate improvements
in ... \[its\] military and economic capabilities as well as increase
its external influence to simultaneously establish political and
economic dominance over the periphery ... \[in order to\] provide
leverage against future great power pressure."20 And these developments,
all told, will almost automatically accentuate regional security
dilemmas vis-à-vis both China's neighbors and the United States. [The
specific location of China's military capabilities makes this danger to
the Asian theater especially problematic]{.underline}. The Soviet
Union's air and land lines of communication to its Asian peripheries
were long, tenuous, and relatively underdeveloped, which made the
sustainability \<END PAGE 5\> of Soviet military forces in the Far East
a challenging proposition. Soviet combat power adjacent to the Pacific,
however significant in absolute terms, was considerably weaker than its
equivalent in Europe. China, by contrast, is highly advantaged on both
counts. It can threaten all the major regional states located along both
its continental and maritime peripheries through highly robust, and
rapidly improving, interior lines of communication. Furthermore, the
bulk of its military capabilities are either directly deployed along its
eastern seaboard or can be swiftly moved to any one of its strategic
peripheries. Thus, by comparison to the Soviet Union, China can more
easily overawe the major power centers in the Indo-Pacific while at the
same time more effectively preventing the United States from bringing
rearward reinforcements to bear in defense of its regional allies.21
[[All these realities]{.mark}---being a continental-sized power,
possessing a gigantic and technologically improving economy, enjoying
superior rates of relative economic growth, having a strategically
advantageous location, and rapidly acquiring formidable military
capabilities--- [**add up quickly** to make China a **far more
consequential rival**]{.mark} to the United States **[than any
Washington has faced in the past]{.mark}**. Although U.S. officials are
bashful about describing China plainly as a geopolitical threat, there
is little doubt that they recognize the possibility of a coming power
transition, with all its attendant dangers]{.underline}. Because of the
perennial arguments among liberals, realists, and neoconservatives,
there is no agreement in Washington about what the implications of this
transition might be. [Yet it is precisely this contingency that U.S.
grand strategy should aim to thwar[t]{.mark} because American primacy
has been beneficial for the international system and, even more
importantly, for the United States itself. [Preserving]{.mark} this
[preeminence]{.mark}, accordingly, [remains the central task for U.S.
policymakers]{.mark} today. Devising a strategy that is equal to this
responsibility must begin with an acknowledgment of both the
significance and the complexity of the challenge given China's deep
enmeshment with the world. There is no better way to begin this
assessment than by recognizing that globalization in the postwar period
has spawned uneven gains that have produced in China a new competitor to
the United States. This most recent bout of international integration
has been reinvigorated and nurtured by American hegemony, understood
simply as possessing more comprehensive power than any other state and
being willing to use that power to structure the global order in certain
ways]{.underline}. Beijing's continuing ascent in these circumstances
creates a difficult dilemma for Washington: unlike previous great powers
that rose largely through autarkic means, China has grown rapidly
because it has benefited disproportionately from American investments in
sustaining a liberal international economic order. China, admittedly, is
not alone in this regard. Many other European and Asian states have
enjoyed economic revitalization in the postwar period because of their
integration into the multilateral trading system underwritten by
American power. But China has experienced disproportionately greater
gains than the United States and others because its native comparative
advantages have been magnified through three distinctive policies.
First, Beijing has opted to maintain a domestic economy characterized by
significant protectionist components even as it has pursued an
investment-driven, export-led growth strategy that exploits the free
access available to the more open economies of the developed world.22
Second, the dominant role of the Chinese state in economic
decisionmaking has permitted the government to control critical factors
of production, such as land and capital, maintain advantageous exchange
rates, and sustain huge state-owned enterprises, which in their totality
have enabled China to advance nationalist aims beyond simply allocative
efficiency and the increased welfare of its population.23 And third, the
consistent and systematic targeting of foreign intellectual property on
a gigantic scale has advanced China's industrial policy goals, which
emphasize the speedy acquisition of advanced technologies by both
legitimate and illegitimate means in order to accelerate Chinese growth
vis-à-vis other rivals in the international system.24 All these elements
operating in unison have raised China's level of development, which in
turn has helped increase American welfare through trade---but at the
cost of embodying a rising challenge to U.S. power. However, [**[it is
by no means inevitable that China will continue to ris]{.mark}e** to the
point where it becomes a genuine peer competitor of the United
States.]{.underline} Although China has experienced meteoric economic
growth in recent decades, the Chinese state has manifold weaknesses. It
grapples with the prospect of adverse demographic transitions,
contradictions between Beijing's command polity and pseudo-liberal
economy, and an unbalanced growth strategy that emphasizes
overinvestment at the cost of domestic consumption. These weaknesses may
yet take their toll, leading to either a collapse of China's hitherto
relentless expansion or its severe moderation.25 The evidence indicates
that China's leaders are acutely aware of the precarious character of
the nation's economic achievements thus far. Given their own problematic
legitimacy, there is no doubt that they are deeply---even
fearfully---concerned about the survival of China's Communist regime in
the context of the rising threats to domestic stability. Given the
growing internal inequalities along multiple dimensions, the rampant
corruption throughout society (and especially among the elites), and the
increasing individuation in the prospering middle classes, China's
leaders remain obsessed by the dangers of internal chaos. They
understand that they might not be able to satisfy the rising
expectations of their now highly informed and restive population. The
decisions reached during the recent third plenum of the 18th Party
Congress indicate that the Xi Jinping regime remains intently focused on
confronting the country's myriad economic problems head-on both in order
to sustain China's global rise and to ward off any indigenous threats to
Communist control within China.26 However, the Xi regime remains
reluctant to face up to the need for constitutional political
liberalization, which raises questions about whether its policies (or
any similar policies followed by its successors) will indeed
satisfactorily dissipate the dangers of domestic instability. On this
score, only time will tell. But the reality of China's internal
troubles---which undoubtedly are considerable---has often strengthened
the belief that its rise as a great power will not prove as troublesome
to others as might be ordinarily expected. According to this line of
thought, China's domestic challenges will prevent its leaders from
pursuing those self-regarding policies that have been prosecuted by all
other great powers in history.27 There is no doubt that if the Chinese
economy falters badly and for a substantial period of time or the
Chinese state is gripped by a cataclysmic crisis---for whatever
reason---the growing challenge to American hegemony would be attenuated.
But absent such calamitous developments, it is unlikely that the weight
of China's internal challenges alone will prevent its leaders from
pursuing those willful policies that would seem natural to Beijing as
its power continues to grow. After all, elevated levels of Chinese
assertiveness, which have been on display since the 2007--2008 global
financial crisis, have occurred despite persistent domestic restiveness
for over five years now. Moreover, internal problems have not prevented
the Chinese state from successfully extracting the necessary resources
to sustain a dramatic military modernization over a long period of time.
Nor have they prevented recent Chinese leaders from steadily
disregarding Deng Xiaoping's old counsel to "hide and bide" in favor of
a new belligerence that takes the form of "show and go." In fact,
Beijing has been able to harness popular sentiments to support its
increasingly abrasive foreign policies in the Indo-Pacific region. Given
this reality[, [the U]{.underline}]{.mark}[nited [St]{.mark}ates [cannot
count on the possibility that China might stumble]{.mark} in any
fundamental sense. Nor can it assume that China's relatively higher
growth rates will naturally decay well before Beijing acquires
sufficient comprehensive power to become a consequential rival.
Washington also cannot presume that its own national capabilities writ
large will always remain more powerful or more fecund than
China's]{.underline}. Still less can it count on the prospect of Chinese
oppugnancy vanishing merely because Chinese growth rates threaten to
ease up somewhat in the future. After all, as Moscow did in years past,
Beijing could still pose a major threat to U.S. interests despite
possessing a smaller economy or experiencing slower economic growth.
[Because China alone among all other emerging powers has the potential
to displace the United States at the top of the international hierarchy,
[Washington confronts the necessity of]{.mark} consciously [developing
a]{.mark} grand [strategy that limits Beijing's ability to erode
overall]{.mark} U.S. [preeminence]{.mark}. This **[corrective strategy
needs to be developed now]{.mark}**, while China is still some distance
away from being able to effectively challenge the United States, **[or
else it risks being too late]{.mark}**]{.underline}. China's deep
integration with the international economy, however, implies that the
containment strategies that worked so effectively against the Soviet
Union cannot be successfully replicated today. Consequently, if
[Washington]{.underline} is to escape from the Scylla of paralyzing
helplessness in the face of China's rise and the Charybdis of inveterate
opposition to that ascent, it [must embark on a novel course of action
that can be best described as "balancing]{.underline} without
containment." This report lays out the logic of such a strategy,
focusing not so much on the current crises enveloping China and the
United States but rather on the structural quandaries created by
Beijing's continuing rise. It begins by reviewing why China's rise is
unique in modern history and examines the specific predicament posed by
China's ascendancy to the United States. Thereafter, it elucidates the
imperative of balancing China, given that other alternatives such as
containment are not options that can be easily exercised by Washington
at the present time. Finally, it develops the outlines of a strategy
that the United States should pursue toward China, an approach that
preserves the benefits of economic interdependence while limiting the
dangers of a Chinese exploitation of its growing power.

### L -- Arms Sales -- Regional Perception 

#### Ending arms sales collapses US alliance structure and emboldens Chinese expansion

More importantly, even [if it were possible to]{.underline} overcome
domestic opposition and [end arms sales]{.underline}, **[such a policy
would be major strategic error]{.underline}**, as [it would compromise
the U.S.'s regional clout by emboldening the Chinese and casting doubt
on U.S. strength in the eyes of its Asian allies]{.underline}. As Nancy
Tucker and Bonnie Glaser argue in the fall 2011 issue of The Washington
Quarterly, **[such a move would "prove to an increasingly confident
China that Washington has become weak, vacillating, and
unreliable]{.underline}**."32 [Combined with strong nationalistic
sentiments within China, such a perception would only encourage China to
continue taking an aggressive stance towards Taiwan.]{.underline} At the
same time, without U.S. support to bolster its confidence, Taiwan might
put recently improving ties with China on hold. In the worst-case
scenario, [an abandoned]{.underline} and desperate [Taiwan]{.underline}
might even declare independence.33 Under the boundaries delineated by
China's ASL, this [would almost certainly provoke an immediate military
response]{.underline}---[**creating a major conflict with the potential
to shatter the peace in East Asia.** Even if an abandoned Taiwan did
peacefully agree to reunification]{.underline} under increased Chinese
pressure, [such a move would call the United States' commitment to
democracy and liberal values into question, which would compromise its
soft power]{.underline}. [America's support for Taiwa]{.underline}n also
[serves as a barometer by which other Asian nations can measure the
United States' commitment to resisting the hegemonic ambitions of the
Chinese]{.underline}. If America suddenly abandoned Taiwan, [Pacific
nations]{.underline} with strong ties to the United States, like Japan,
South Korea, Australia, Thailand, and the Philippines, [might be
prompted reevaluate their alliances with the United States]{.underline}.
This would undoubtedly harm some of the United States' key interests in
the region. As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton notes, the United
States' alliances with these nations "leverage \[America's\] regional
presence and enhance \[its\] regional leadership at a time of evolving
security challenges." 34 As such, there is good reason to think that the
negative ramifications of abandoning Taiwan outweigh any of the
potential benefits of trying to win Beijing's favor.

reflected Beijing's estimate that Washington could be intimidated or
misled, as it juxtaposed a reference to Taiwan as a Chinese core
interest with concurrence that ''the two sides agreed that respecting
each other's core interests is extremely important to ensure steady
progress in U.S---China relations.''4 [Analysts who argue that
Washington can safely appease Beijing]{.underline} because ''territorial
concessions are not always bound to fail'' [are]{.underline}, **[without
evidence]{.underline}**, [assuming improbably modest Chinese
objectives]{.underline} (emphasis added).5 [Relying on the sacrifice of
Taiwan to fulfill Chinese ambitions **ignores more than intentions**, it
also **overlooks internal dynamics in China**. Beijing confronts
constant domestic turmoil. Corruption, income inequality, and
environmental degradation have tarnished the accomplishments of the
government and party. Fears among the leadership concerning mounting
social unrest, spurred by the Jasmine Revolutions in the Middle East,
produced harsh restrictions of the media and the Internet along with the
imprisonment of artists, underground church members, protesting
peasants, lawyers, and human rights activists. Regaining Taiwan is
**unlikely to provide a broad and enduring balance to internal
unhappiness**. Beijing also confronts militant nationalism
which]{.underline}, though fostered by the government, [is]{.underline}
still [difficult to control]{.underline}. [Any suspicion that
authorities are not adequately safeguarding Chinese interests and
securing international respect could **threaten regime

while gratifying, **could not thoroughly slake a continuing need for
Beijing to demonstrate its power**]{.underline}. Indeed, [the sacrifice
might promote **new appetites** and **necessitate fresh efforts to
satisfy that need**. Accommodating China's demands on Taiwan, moreover,
**would not necessarily cause Beijing to be more pliable on other
matters of importance to the United States**.]{.underline} [Beijing's
positions on issues such as Korea and Iran are shaped by China's
national interests and are not taken as favors to

China from increasing pressure on Pyongyang to give up nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. [Resolving China's Taiwan problem
**would**]{.underline} also **[not mean greater
cooperation]{.underline}** in preventing Iran from going nuclear given
Beijing's almost universal opposition to muscular sanctions, its growing

East.

### L -- Taiwan Key -- Containment Strategy

#### U.S. -- Taiwan relationship key to counter china -- only way to prevent a hostile rise

**Greenert 18**

(Admiral Jonathan W., former U.S. chief of naval operations and
chairmember of National Security Studies at the National Bureau of Asian
Research, "Strengthening U.S.--Taiwan Defense Relations," NBR, May 2018,

The [U.S.-Taiwan relationship is under the spotlight at a critical
time]{.underline}. [Concerns are rising over China's global campaign to
undermine Taiwan's legitimacy]{.underline}. A freeze has occurred in
official cross-strait exchanges since the Tsai Ing-wen administration
took office, [the U.S.-China trade relationship is increasingly
tense]{.underline}, and the Trump administration has shown a growing
interest in the Indo-Pacific region. [Washington is certainly aware of
Chinese assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific.]{.underline} The rapid pace
of People's Liberation Army (PLA) modernization has positioned China to
carry out its active defense strategy in the western Pacific, South
China Sea, and Indian Ocean within a few years. Despite the continuous
presence of these strategic and military challenges, [Washington still
lacks a consensus on how to strike a balance between the merits of
fostering defense relations with Taipei and the costs of retaliation
from Beijing]{.underline}. During the Obama administration, the United
States' and Taiwan's diverging views on defense policy and cooperation
posed obstacles to bilateral security ties. [Due to rapid Chinese
military modernization]{.underline} and then president Ma Ying-jeou's
prioritization of relations with China, the [United States developed an
"asymmetrical defense" framework for its arms sales policy]{.underline}.
This framework essentially [meant that Taiwan had to rely on its
geography and focus on anti-landing operations]{.underline} to counter a
PLA amphibious invasion scenario. The United States expected Taiwan to
invest most heavily in land-based mobile antiship cruise missiles, sea
mines, and multiple-launch rocket systems. Meanwhile, Taiwan's desire
for larger platforms, such as submarines and jet fighters, was
considered "symbolic" or "unrealistic" in Washington. Decision-makers in
the Obama administration felt that such force planning could never
compete with China in the long run---a position that led to a reduction
in arms sales. As a result, over the past decade Taiwan has been limited
in its ability to invest in self-defense capabilities. After years of
these trends, mainstream rhetoric in Washington remains centered on the
concept of asymmetrical defense and a perceived conservatism in Taiwan's
defense budget. [Since]{.underline} President Donald [Trump]{.underline}
received the congratulatory phone call from President Tsai after his
election in 2016, the [dynamics in U.S.-Taiwan defense
relations]{.underline} have [begun to change.]{.underline} The Trump
administration made its first announcement of arms sales to Taiwan only
ten months after assuming office. [Opportunities for further arms sales
are likely to increase]{.underline}, not least because arms sales are
also perceived to have a positive economic dimension. In addition, the
Trump administration appears less inclined to constrain its Taiwan
policy based on the asymmetrical defense framework. In April 2018, the
[State Department granted marketing licenses for U.S. defense companies
to sell submarine technology to Taiwan]{.underline} after years of
waiting. Additionally, high-ranking officials in the Trump
administration have supported U.S. Navy port calls to Taiwan, believing
this would demonstrate the United States' potential interest in
[fostering closer maintenance and logistics cooperation with
Taiwan,]{.underline} such as in 2015 when two U.S. F/A-18C aircraft made
a successful emergency landing in Taiwan. Additional areas for
U.S.-Taiwan defense cooperation exist, particularly on cybersecurity and
intelligence. In 2017, Taiwan launched a new Information,
Communications, and Electronic Force Command under the Ministry of
National Defense. While traditional [defense relations]{.underline} with
the United States---based primarily on arms sales---remain
States---based primarily on arms sales---[remain sensitive and will
become more so as China increases its power]{.underline} and influence,
cooperation in the cyber and electronic-warfare domains can bring
greater benefits to both sides. What can the United States expect from
Taiwan in these areas? Taiwan is known for its large pool of
cybersecurity talent. Personnel exchanges with the island would help
U.S. military interlocutors and policymakers better understand Chinese
cyber capabilities and vulnerabilities. Future bilateral defense
cooperation should devote greater attention to intelligence and cyber
exchanges, including through the new command, while helping fortify
Taiwan's counterespionage capabilities against incessant Chinese spying.
[U.S.-Taiwan defense relations can and must be characterized by mutual
cooperation]{.underline}, especially in light of China's aspirations to
become the regional security leader. A strong defense relationship based
on mutual respect will send a clear political message to China that this
and other U.S.-led partnerships in the region are built for the long
haul and cannot be easily divided.

Consequently, [there is a risk that Beijing planners and decision-makers
might determine they could launch a successful offensive against
Taiwan]{.underline}. [That perception in Beijing makes aggression in the
strait and a war with the United States more likely.]{.underline} The
bipartisan National Defense Strategy Commission
[listed](https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/2018-11/providing-for-the-common-defense.pdf)
aggression against Taiwan as a top concern, arguing that [allowing China
to absorb Taiwan by military force would constitute a "crushing blow to
America's credibility and regional position."]{.underline} In addition
to genuine hard-power concerns, there is also a matter of principle.
When an authoritarian power threatens and bullies a democratic people,
America is not neutral. Furthermore, [providing Taiwan the means to
defend itself is not just consistent with sound policy and good
principle]{.underline} --- [it is the law]{.underline}. The Taiwan
Relations Act made clear that the establishment of diplomatic relations
with Beijing rested on the expectation that the future of Taiwan would
be "determined by peaceful means." To make this a reality, [the law says
the U.S. will provide the weapons "necessary to enable Taiwan to
maintain a sufficient self-defense capability."]{.underline} Admittedly,
successive U.S. administrations have interpreted and implemented this
rather vague statute differently. However, what seems clear is that
Taiwan's ability to defend itself against an increasingly belligerent
and capable military threat from the mainland is in doubt. That would
suggest that [the current arms package]{.underline} under consideration
[is not only permissible and advisable under the law]{.underline},
[but]{.underline} [essential. The administration deserves credit for
expanding]{.underline} [freedom of navigation

Congress to support new [arms sales to Taiwan]{.underline}. Those are
good first steps, but they are not enough. In addition to providing
these arms without delay and
[stopping](https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/427175-american-military-superiority-will-fade-without-bold-national-action)
the erosion of U.S. military superiority vis-a-vis China, [Washington

the strait.]{.underline}

During World War II, Adm. Ernest King aptly portrayed Formosa as the
'cork' in the 'bottle' of the South China Sea---as a base from which
naval and air forces could seal off imperial Japan's Southern Resource
Area. Similarly, **[Taiwan has long served as a literal and figurative
cork in China's bottle]{.underline}**, riveting Beijing's attention on
the cross-strait stalemate while complicating north-south movement along
the Asian seaboard and access to the Western Pacific. [Uncorking the
bottle would]{.underline}, in effect, [free up resources for China to
pursue broader regional aims]{.underline}. For example, [Japan and South
Korea would feel the effects once Beijing stationed naval and air forces
on the island, turning their southern flank and imposing control of
adjacent seas and skie]{.underline}s. All Northeast Asian nations depend
on the seas to convey imports and exports to and from their seaports. As
we can infer from Adm. King's words, [absolute control of China's
economic lifelines equates to a stranglehold over the maritime-dependent
Japanese and Korean economies]{.underline}. [This fact isn't lost on
Chinese strategists]{.underline}. In this brave new world, Tokyo and
Seoul would find little solace in US nuclear guarantees or assurances of
future support, and would have little choice but to provide for their
own defence. **[The modest arms race already underway would
accelerate.]{.underline}** Beware of unintended consequences. As Glaser
frames it, optimistic realism serves neither US interests nor American
ideals in the Far East. Nor does history provide much sustenance for
strategies aimed at bartering territory for great power concord. Another
optimistic realist, Henry Kissinger, has noted that German unification
left the 19th century system of European power politics brittle. The
time-honoured way by which European powers resolved their grievances was
to parcel out bits and pieces of territory. They appeased one
another---for a time---by broadening the monarchs' geographic sway and
gratifying their vanity. Kissinger seemingly approves of this method of
easing tensions, judging from his praise of the Concert of Europe, an
arrangement instituted at the 1815 Congress of Vienna to manage
great-power relations. And indeed, the congress system preserved peace
for decades, as its founders intended. The lands used to mollify
European rulers came largely from Germany, which remained fragmented
into many small kingdoms and principalities and powerless to resist such
agreements. Forestalling a general war, then, came at a steep cost to
the inhabitants of German states shuttled from ruler to ruler without
their consent. This is hardly a precedent worth emulating today. Moral
qualms aside, the techniques employed by the concert ceased working
after German unification in 1871. Once Otto von Bismarck had forged a
muscle-bound German Reich, there were no more territories to shift
around to appease the great powers in times of strife. As Kissinger
notes, the flexibility went out of the concert system. Suspicions and
animosities mounted late in the century, marching the continent toward
the precipice of World War I. As it turned out, paying off governments
with land was a tactical measure, not a way to bring about enduring
peace. **[Payoffs don't beget goodwill, while their pacifying effect is
fleeting]{.underline}**. So much for land-for-peace diplomacy in
post-Napoleonic Europe. Or look at 19th century China. Imperial powers
plucked away seaports along the Chinese coast and imposed 'unequal
treaties' while asserting spheres of primacy throughout the country. A
decaying Qing Dynasty could offer only feeble resistance. [Capt. Alfred
Thayer
Mahan](https://thediplomat.com/flashpoints-blog/2011/01/06/garbage-in-garbage-out/)
likened this spectacle to imperial 'eagles' descending on the 'carcass'
of a debilitated China. Alarmed that Europeans might dismember China, US
Secretary of State John Hay circulated 'Open Door' notes among European
capitals in 1900, pleading for equal access to the country. And yet no
amount of East Asian colonies or spheres of interest managed to avert
World War I, which broke out scant years after the Open Door circulars
made the rounds. Overseas acquisitions satisfied the great powers'
appetites only temporarily. And finally, the fact is that history amply
demonstrates that new territorial acquisitions encourage statesmen to
seek forward defences for their valuable new holdings. The quest for a
defensive buffer for India, the jewel in the crown of the British
Empire, drove British policy in Central Asia during the 'Great Game'
with imperial Russia. And after its triumph in the Russo-Japanese War of
1904-1905, Tokyo almost instantly set out to mount a forward defence of
Korea, its principal gain from the conflict. Japanese pursuit of
security on the Asian mainland ultimately led Tokyo to invade first
Manchuria, then China proper. To be sure, obtaining the Korean Peninsula
and the southern half of Sakhalin Island in the peace settlement
satiated perceived Japanese security needs and steadied the regional
balance of power---briefly. But the ensuing strategic equilibrium bought
Britain and the United States too little time to respond adequately to
Japan's eventual, forcible reordering of the Asian hierarchy. British
leaders had struck up an alliance with Tokyo in 1902 in hopes that Japan
would become a responsible stakeholder in its own backyard---managing
East Asian affairs while permitting Britain to withdraw its fleet to
tend to the growing, and more pressing, rivalry with Imperial Germany
and its High Seas Fleet. This 'realist' calculus shattered during the
opening phases of the Pacific War, when Japanese forces launched a
blitzkrieg that dismantled the British Empire's Far East holdings.
Ambitious great powers tend to devour territorial concessions as
appetizers---not dessert. The bottom line is that [ceding territory to
land-hungry powers is a morally bankrupt enterprise that applies only a
temporary fix for international quarrels]{.underline}---briefly papering
over fundamental, nonnegotiable disagreements about the existing order.
And [this approach emboldens recipients]{.underline} of new land in the
process. Why would things be different this time? Prof. Glaser says he
offers an optimistic vision. Maybe. It's certainly not a very realistic
one.

It has hit Taiwan especially hard; [Taipei has no other security

the most stressing. [Taiwanese officials have discovered to their
chagrin that Washington is unwilling to sell them new fighters, tanks,
drones, and destroyers]{.underline}.47 Even diesel- electric submarine
technology, promised by George W. Bush in 2001, has heretofore proven
out of reach for Taipei.48 The White House, fearful of rousing
Beijing\'s ire, has instead offered Taiwan equipment of the type
provided to Mexico.49 Adding insult to injury, the Taiwanese have looked
on in astonishment as U.S. Navy ships make port calls up and down the
PRC coast, then sail past Taiwan at full steam as if it were a dreadful
pariah state, not a friendly democratic country.50 The landslide results
of the recent presidential and legislative elections in Taipei are
telling. The citizens of Taiwan chose Dr. [Tsai]{.underline} Ing-wen,
who [is]{.underline} widely viewed as tough on China and friendly to the
United States, and therefore [more likely to secure a better future
relationship with Washington]{.underline}.51 At the same time,
[they]{.underline} also [chose a Democratic Progressive Party whose
policy platform calls for a more robust indigenous defense industry as a
pragmatic hedge against]{.underline} continued American
[quagmire]{.underline}.52 Taiwan\'s new government wants to arm itself
and will do so whether its \"big brother\" helps or not. This can-do
attitude means that the [small island democracy,]{.underline} largely
ignored for the past decade, [will soon be at the forefront of American

[When]{.underline} President Barack [Obama announced]{.underline} what
he called [the]{.underline} U.S. "[pivot to Asia]{.underline}" before
the Australian parliament in 2011, [he]{.underline} linked America's
strategic interests to the success of democracy in the region and
[pledged "every element of American power" to achieving "security,
prosperity, and dignity for all." That places Taiwan and its democratic
future at the strategic epicenter of America's moral and political
commitment to the region]{.underline}. [[U.S. credibility is]{.mark} now
[tied]{.mark} inextricably [to Taiwan]{.mark}'s fate]{.underline},
**[[with or without]{.mark} an explicit defense commitment in [the
TRA]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Any **weakening of American
resolve**]{.mark} to ensure Taiwan's continued security [would]{.mark}
significantly [undermine]{.mark} that [credibility]{.mark} [throughout
the region among **friends, allies, and**]{.mark} most critically, our
**[adversaries]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Those who argue that the Taiwan game is not worth the candle fail to
grasp how much weight [other countries in the region]{.mark}
[place]{.mark} on America's [commitment to Taiwan as a **bell-weather of
U.S. reliability**]{.mark}]{.underline} [should any of them come under
increased coercive pressure]{.underline} or outright hostility [from
China]{.underline}. [They see the U.S. as the necessary balancer to
China's military buildup and expansionist policies and Taiwan **is the
number one test case of U.S. will.**]{.underline}

[That is why the U.S. declarative policy of ["strategic ambiguity"
**needs to change** sooner rather than later]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Washington's [refusal to make an **explicit public commitment**]{.mark}
to not only provide Taiwan with defensive weapons but to come actively
to its defense **[sows doubts in the region]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Worse, it **encourages China to** continue **pursuing its anti-access,
area denial strategy** of deploying attack submarines and ballistic
missiles to deter, delay, or defeat any U.S. intervention in a
cross-Strait conflict]{.underline}. After all, Washington has said ever
since 1995 that it might or might not defend Taiwan depending on the
circumstances. So Beijing has been creating the circumstances to affect
that calculus. Would it have invested so much of its national wealth and
effort to an anti-Taiwan strategy if the U.S. had made it clear back in
1995 that an attack on Taiwan would certainly mean military conflict,
possibly all-out war with the United States? Whatever their faults,
Chinese leaders are not suicidal. Yet, [[some experts argue that]{.mark}
a clear [declarative policy]{.mark} statement [is
unnecessary]{.mark}]{.underline} and "passé." According to that thesis,
China has been told in no uncertain terms in various private meetings of
the U.S. commitment to defend Taiwan so, they argue, it is already being
deterred from taking action against Taiwan.

[[There are several flaws]{.mark} in that analysis. [First, **it is
highly implausible**]{.mark} that **[a U.S. commitment]{.mark}** to go
to war with China **[could be made behind closed
doors]{.mark}**]{.underline} without the American public being informed.
[[Second]{.mark}, any [commitment]{.mark} **that is [not made publicly
lacks credibility]{.mark}** precisely [because]{.mark} **American
[prestige is not on the line]{.mark}** -- [a secret red line is]{.mark}
especially **[evanescent]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Third, [[China
observed]{.mark} with interest [what happened when]{.mark}, for one
brief shining moment, [strategic clarity broke]{.mark} through U.S.
policy]{.underline}. After the EP-3 incident in April 2001, President
George W. Bush was asked what the U.S. would do to defend Taiwan against
a Chinese attack; he replied "whatever it takes." That unambiguous
statement sent shock waves through the China specialist community. White
House and State Department officials rushed to "clarify" that U.S.
policy had not changed. Fourth, [much as Chinese leaders complain
about]{.underline} U.S. [arms sales]{.underline} to Taiwan, [they
understand that Washington has deferred to their sensibilities in both
the quantity and quality of the weapons transferred]{.underline}.
[Taiwan is consistently denied the advanced systems it
requests:]{.underline} F-16 CDs, F-35s, [diesel
submarines](http://thediplomat.com/2015/05/taiwans-submarine-saga/).
Fifth, [[Beijing has reason to doubt]{.mark} Americans' [will and
staying power in **any serious military confrontation with
China**]{.mark}]{.underline}. After all, [China]{.underline}
[has]{.underline} had first[-hand experience facing America's conduct of
limited war]{.underline} in Korea and Vietnam. [[It
has]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[observed]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S.
[[strategic planners' **penchant for "off-ramps"** on the escalatory
ladder]{.underline}]{.mark} -- [even with non-kinetic means like
sanctions, particularly against a major power,]{.underline} as in the
case of Iran over its nuclear program or Russia over Ukraine. [[China's
leaders]{.mark} may well [calculate that]{.mark}, even if there is an
initial U.S. response to a Chinese move and [Beijing demonstrates a
willingness to escalate the crisis]{.mark} over its core
interest]{.underline}, **[[it will be Washington that will blink
first.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[This question will become less theoretical as Taiwan's 2016 election
approaches]{.underline}. [If the candidate of the Democratic Progressive
Party appears to have a reasonable prospect of winning, let alone if he
or she is favored, [Beijing may see its last chance at peaceful
unification receding out of reach]{.mark}]{.underline}. [At that point,
as China's leaders from Mao Zedong on have made clear, **[Beijing will
not hesitate to resort to the use of
force]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [That threat was codified in
China's 2005 Anti-Secession Law]{.underline}, [which threatened war if
Taiwan declared formal independence or took actions toward that
end]{.underline}. But the ASL went beyond warning Taiwan against taking
affirmative pro-independence action; it also threatened Taiwan
for failing to act in accordance with China's wishes. It states: "In the
event that . . . possibilities for a peaceful reunification should be
completely exhausted, the state shall employ non-peaceful means and
other necessary measures to protect China's sovereignty and territorial
integrity." In other words, [[both de jure and de
facto independence]{.mark} (Taiwan's present status quo) [are
unacceptable to **Beijing and would justify going to
war**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

### L -- Taiwan Key -- AT "Arms Sales Are the Only Reason for Anger"

#### This is a poor reading of IR -- Other issues guarantee aggression 

**Wang, 2019**

Yuan-kang, Professor of Political Science at Western Michigan
University, "Rethinking US Security Commitment to Taiwan," Palgrave,
6/24/19, 10.1007/978-3-319-77125-0//WS

[Accommodating China on Taiwan]{.underline} is risky and dangerous[. It
would lead to false optimism about US-China relations and increase the
probability of conflict.]{.underline} The fundamental cause of US-China
strategic distrust lies in the anarchic structure of the international
system, not Taiwan. [Even without the Taiwan issue, the international
structure would still push China and the United States into intense
security competition]{.underline}, generating strategic distrust and
mutual suspicion. [Abandoning Taiwan would not make for a more
cooperative relationship between the United States and China, nor would
it prevent future conflict.]{.underline} The US security commitment to
Taiwan is consistent with American democratic values and strategic
interests. [Failing to come to Taiwan's defense would jeopardize US
credibility in protecting its Asian allies and create new security
dynamics that could further destabilize the region. Appeasing China by
giving up Taiwan would increase]{.underline}, not reduce, [China's
foreign policy ambitions]{.underline}. It is risky to assume that
China's foreign policy is guided by limited aims and will remain
unchanged as its power grows. Rising states tend to expand,63 and we
have no good reason to expect China to behave otherwise. The emerging
international structure foretells a deepening of US-Taiwan security
cooperation in the foreseeable future. Taiwan may take comfort that US
accommodating China on Taiwan is mainly an academic discussion and does
not reflect a change in US policy, but Taiwan must take measures
consistent with the dictates of international structure. To reduce its
vulnerability to China's military coercion, [Taiwan needs to strengthen
itself, diversify its foreign trade and investment, and maintain strong
ties with the United States. The ultimate objective of US grand strategy
toward Asia is to maintain a regional balance of power. In that regard,
Taiwan is an asset, not a liability.]{.underline}

### Appeasement = China expansion

#### Appeasement causes Chinese expansionism -- increases risks of conflict

There are certain [core issues troubling the Sino-U.S.
relationship]{.underline} that [extend far beyond the Taiwan
Strait.]{.underline} Whether it is Beijing's assertiveness towards its
neighbors \[9\], some of whom, like Japan and the Philippines, are
treaty allies of the United States, or issues related to cyber-espionage
and human rights, the [challenges currently testing the bilateral
relationship are profound and numerous. China is a revisionist
power]{.underline} \[10\]---and its claims on the international system
do not end with Taiwan. [One should not surmise]{.underline}, therefore,
[that Sino-U.S. strategic competition would abate were the Taiwan issue
to be resolved]{.underline}. Indeed, a growing body of work in the
strategic studies community has suggested that [Sino-U.S. tensions are
more structural than conjectural, and are the natural result
of]{.underline} the\[11\][friction]{.underline} \[11\] [that
traditionally occurs between rising and established powers]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [while some may assume that China's absorption of Taiwan
might provide]{.underline} at least [a symbolic first step]{.underline}
towards a more stable and peaceful relationship between Washington and
Beijing, [this hypothesis also appears]{.underline} somewhat
[untenable]{.underline}. To the contrary, an [American abandonment of
Taiwan might only succeed in emboldening, and strengthening hardline
elements within Beijing's leadership, by providing a material
confirmation of their long-held desire to see America progressively
retreat from the Indo-Pacific theater]{.underline}. Bonnie Glaser and
Nancy Bernkopf Tucker have expressed their concerns \[12\] over such a
development, cautioning that [A decision to jettison Taiwan, or even cut
back significantly on U.S. support, would prove to an increasingly
confident China that Washington has become weak, vacillating and
unreliable]{.underline}...Accordingly, [a U.S. sacrifice of Taiwan,
while gratifying, could not thoroughly slake a continuing need for
Beijing to demonstrate its power. Indeed, the sacrifice might promote
new appetites and necessitate fresh efforts to satisfy that
need.]{.underline}

### Plan =/= peace / AT No link

#### The link takes out solvency - the plan is a concession to China that fails to create peace -- 

**Jackson 15** (Van Jackson; Senior Lecturer in International Relations
at Victoria University of Wellington, and the Defence and Strategy
Fellow at the Centre for Strategic Studies;
<https://thediplomat.com/2015/08/the-myth-of-a-us-china-grand-bargain/>;
"The Myth of a US-China Grand Bargain "; 8-6-15)

A number of [scholars have tried to advance]{.underline} the
well-intentioned proposal [that U.S. concessions to China's many
concerns will somehow facilitate a peaceful order in Asia]{.underline}.
While I agree with the sentiment and recognize that there are areas of
international life where Sino-U.S. cooperation is essential, **[the idea
that U.S. accommodation of China will produce a peaceful and stable
order in Asia isn't just unrealistic; it's irresponsible.]{.underline}**
Though it wasn't the first, Hugh White's China Choice was an early and
pointed call for the United States to form a "G-2" with China in which
the two countries would work together to set the terms of the regional
order, requiring that the United States accommodate the demands of a
rising China. Jim Steinberg's and Michael O'Hanlon's Strategic
Reassurance and Resolve reiterates many of White's points, but with
better theoretical grounding. Lyle Goldstein's Meeting China Halfway
argues far more persuasively than many in this lineage, and some of his
specific recommendations merit serious consideration---not least because
they would incur no great cost to try. But there are equally serious
reasons to doubt the transformative ambitions attached to U.S.
concessions. The latest salvo in this "America must accommodate China"
literature hails from an accomplished political scientist at George
Washington University, Charles Glaser, writing in the most recent issue
of International Security. Glaser makes the sweeping and somewhat
unhelpful claim that military competition is risky and therefore
undesirable. As an alternative [he suggests that if only the United
States would abandon commitments to Taiwan, China would be willing to
resolve its territorial disputes in the East and South China Sea,
thereby sidestepping military competition]{.underline}. Prior to around
2008, proposals for U.S. accommodation of a rising China made much more
sense, or at least could be taken more seriously. **[But times have
changed. China's ambitions have changed]{.underline}**. **[And so has
its foreign policy behavior]{.underline}**. These contextual changes
matter for whether and when accommodation can have the desired effect.
More to the point though, there are a number of problems with the grand
bargain line of argumentation. First, [any proposal for a Sino-U.S.
solution to regional problems is by definition taking a great power view
of Asia that marginalizes the agency and strategic relevance of U.S.
allies and the region's middle powers]{.underline}. In the brief period
(five to ten years ago) when a G-2 concept was taken semi-seriously in
Washington, allies---especially South Korea and Japan---chafed. The
region's middle powers would be unlikely to simply follow the joint
dictates of China and the United States without being part of it, and
attempting a G-2 could ironically create a more fragmented order as a
result. Including others, at any rate, is antithetical to the concept of
a Sino-U.S. G-2 arrangement. As early as the 1960s U.S. officials tried
to rely on China to deal with regional issues spanning from North Korea
to Vietnam. It was almost always to no avail. Second, and as I've
written about extensively elsewhere, [Asia is rife with security
concerns that have nothing to do with China directly, so any
understanding reached with China would leave unresolved many of the
region's latent sources of potential conflict]{.underline}. Sino-U.S.
grand bargain proponents forget that China and the United States only
have real conflicts of interest by proxy. Every conceivable conflict
scenario involves China and some other Asian state---Taiwan, Japan, the
Philippines, Korea. The United States only becomes part of the picture
because of a commitment to regional order, including its alliance
network. Third, as its recent stock market crash makes all too obvious,
China remains a "fragile superpower," to quote Susan Shirk. Many factors
in its domestic political situation---corruption, growing wealth
disparities, and many forms of civil challenges to government
legitimacy---make it an unpredictable player. Nor is China showing
meaningful signs of political liberalization. There's so much brewing
underneath the surface in China that dealing with China today as if it
were a hegemon tomorrow assumes too much, and grants China too much
credit too soon. Fourth, [there's a defunct theory that's been smuggled
into arguments about changing Chinese behavior through U.S.
accommodation]{.underline}. Political scientists call it
"neofunctionalism," a term rarely used these days, even though its
spirit is pervasive in grand bargain arguments. Neofunctionalism came
about in the 1950s as a failed way to account for and push for European
integration.[The basic idea involved an assumption that low level and
innocuous types of cooperation would "spillover" into still more and
better quality cooperation]{.underline}. Comity among nations, it was
thought, would be the eventual outcome of mundane socioeconomic
interactions. But by the 1970s, **[the theory had become largely
discredited]{.underline}**.

### Containment Key -- Solves China Hostile Rise

#### China rise causes war

**Allision** 20**18**

(Graham, Douglas Dillon Professor of Government at Harvard Kennedy
School, "War Between China and the United States Isn\'t Inevitable, But
It\'s Likely: An Excerpt From Graham Allison\'s \"Destined for War\"",

https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/war-between-china-and-united-states-isnt-inevitable-its-likely-excerpt-graham-allisons)//CS

[Will Presidents Trump and Xi, or their successors, follow in the tragic
footsteps of the leaders of Athens and Sparta or Britain and
Germany]{.underline}? In his new Gelber Prize-nominated book, [Allison
says the **omens are not good**]{.underline} Two centuries ago, Napoleon
warned, "[Let China sleep; when she wakes, she will shake the world."
Today **China has awakened**, and **the world is beginning to
shake**]{.underline}. Yet many Americans are still in denial about what
China's transformation from agrarian backwater to "the biggest player in
the history of the world" means for the United States. What is this
book's Big Idea? In a phrase, Thucydides's Trap. [When a **rising power
threatens to displace a ruling power**, alarm bells should sound: danger
ahead. China and the United States are **currently on a collision course
for war**]{.underline} --- unless both parties take difficult and
painful actions to avert it. [As a **rapidly ascending China**
challenges America's accustomed predominance, these two nations risk
falling into a deadly trap]{.underline} first identified by the ancient
Greek historian Thucydides. Writing about a war that devastated the two
leading city-states of classical Greece two and a half millennia ago, he
explained: "[It was the rise of Athens and the fear that this instilled
in Sparta that made war inevitable."]{.underline} That primal insight
describes a perilous historical pattern. Reviewing the record of the
past five hundred years, the Thucydides's Trap Project I direct at
Harvard has [found 16 cases in which a major nation's rise has disrupted
the position of a dominant state]{.underline}. In the most infamous
example, an industrial [Germany rattled Britain's established position
at the top of the pecking order a century ago. The catastrophic outcome
of their competition necessitated a new category of **violent conflict:
world war**]{.underline}. Our research finds that 12 of these rivalries
ended in war and four did not --- not a comforting ratio for the
21st-century's most important geopolitical contest. This is not a book
about China. [It is about the **impact of a rising China** on the U.S.
and the global order]{.underline}. For seven decades since the Second
World War, a rules-based framework led by Washington has defined world
order, producing an era without war among great powers. Most people now
think of this as normal. Historians call it a rare "Long Peace." Today,
[an **increasingly powerful** China is unraveling this order, throwing
into question the peace generations have taken for granted.]{.underline}
In 2015, the Atlantic published "The Thucydides Trap: Are the U.S. and
China headed for War?" In that essay I argued that this historical
metaphor provides the best lens available for illuminating relations
between China and the U.S. today. Since then, the concept has ignited
considerable debate. Rather than face the evidence and reflect on the
uncomfortable but necessary adjustments both sides might make, policy
wonks and presidents alike have constructed a straw man around
[Thucydides's claim about "inevitability." They have then put a torch to
it --- arguing that war between Washington and Beijing is not
predetermined.]{.underline} At their 2015 summit, Presidents Barack
Obama and Xi Jinping discussed the Trap at length. Obama emphasized that
despite the structural stress created by China's rise, "the two
countries are capable of managing their disagreements." At the same
time, they acknowledged that, in Xi's words, "[should major countries
time and again make the mistakes of **strategic miscalculation,** they
might create such traps for themselves."]{.underline} I concur: war
between the U.S. and China is not inevitable. Indeed, Thucydides would
agree that neither was war between Athens and Sparta. Read in context,
it is clear that he meant his claim about inevitability as hyperbole:
exaggeration for the purpose of emphasis. The point of Thucydides's Trap
is neither fatalism nor pessimism. Instead, it points us beyond the
headlines and regime rhetoric to recognize the tectonic structural
stress that Beijing and Washington must master to construct a peaceful
relationship. If Hollywood were making a movie pitting China against the
United States on the path to war, central casting could not find two
better leading actors than Xi Jinping and Donald Trump. [Each
personifies his country's deep aspirations of **national greatness.**
Much as Xi's appointment as leader of China in 2012 accentuated **the
role of the rising power**, America's election of Donald Trump in a
campaign that vilified China promises a more vigorous response from the
ruling power.]{.underline} As personalities, Trump and Xi could not be
more different. As protagonists in a struggle to be number one, however,
[they share portentous similarities]{.underline}. Both: --- Are driven
by a common ambition: to make their nation great again. --- [Identify
the nation ruled by the other as the principal obstacle to their
dream]{.underline}. --- Take pride in their own unique leadership
capabilities. --- [See themselves playing a central role in revitalizing
their nation]{.underline}. --- Have announced daunting domestic agendas
that call for radical changes. --- [Have fired up **populist
nationalist** support to "drain the swamp" of corruption at home and
confront attempts by each other to thwart their nation's historic
mission]{.underline}. [Will the impending clash between these **two
great nations lead to war?**]{.underline} Will Presidents Trump and Xi,
or their successors, follow in the tragic footsteps of the leaders of
Athens and Sparta or Britain and Germany? Or will they find a way to
avoid war as effectively as Britain and the U.S. did a century ago or
the U.S. and the Soviet Union did through four decades of Cold War?
Obviously, no one knows. We can be certain, however, that the dynamic
Thucydides identified will intensify in the years ahead. Denying
Thucydides's Trap does not make it less real. [Recognizing it does not
mean just accepting whatever happens. We owe it to future generations to
**face one of history's most brutal tendencies head on**]{.underline}
and then do everything we can to defy the odds.

### Containment Key -- Solves China Hostile Rise

#### Chinas rise creates security competition that escalates -- only containment solves

Four Reasons to Manage China's Rise ; 11-7-18)

Why, then, does China's rise generate so much anxiety? Over the past two
years, I have travelled across the Indo-Pacific region, from Colombo to
Kuala Lumpur, Tokyo to Taipei, Hanoi to Honolulu, Port Blair to Perth,
Washington to Wellington, and beyond to Europe and the Middle East. In
all of these places and many others, regional political leaders,
diplomats, and military officers echo similar [concerns about China's
rise]{.underline}. Such concerns persist despite Beijing adopting a less
confrontational approach over the past few months towards Southeast
Asia, Japan, and India among others. Essentially, they are four reasons
for continuing concern about China's rise. The first -- infrequently
stated, and rarely in a public setting -- is a product of China's
continued opacity of decision-making and centralisation of power. This
is problematic **[because China is no longer an isolated and
inward-looking country]{.underline}**, **[but a state whose decisions
have direct implications for the rest of the world]{.underline}**. While
many had hoped that China's economic and social integration would be
accompanied by decision-making transparency, the consolidation of power
by Xi Jinping has diminished such expectations. Today, even relatively
minor actions by China are viewed with a great deal of scepticism. As
former Indonesian Deputy Foreign Minister Dino Patti Djalal recently
observed, while Washington is a known quantity, [China remains an
"enigma" in strategic terms]{.underline}. And even hardened realists
would acknowledge **[that opacity of intentions exacerbates security
competition]{.underline}**. A second area of growing concern involves
China's economic and trade policies, about which anxieties are much more
pronounced and public. The continuing dominance of state-backed and
heavily-subsidised enterprises, restrictive market access in certain
sectors, active industrial espionage programs, and a supply-side
approach to development have resulted in market distortions, an uneven
playing field, and ballooning debt. Political and policy leaders
increasingly believe that China's model has harmed growth and job
prospects in their own countries. The United States under Donald Trump
has chosen to contest China's "predatory economics" by slapping tariffs
and tightening investment opportunities. In Australia, Chinese
investments in critical infrastructure have become a hot-button issue.
In India, Chinese dumping has soured business sentiments. China's
signature international economic strategy -- the Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI, also known as One Belt, One Road) -- is only exporting
and further exacerbating these concerns. Third, while China is not alone
in the region in having territorial disputes, [its recent actions
concerning disputed territory have been disconcerting]{.underline}.
Beijing regularly employs civilian tools -- armed fishing boats,
dredging vessels, road construction crews, and civil aviation -- to
impose control or authority over disputed territory. US Secretary of
State Mike Pompeo has declared that the Indo-Pacific should be "free
from coercion or great power domination," such sentiments find resonance
elsewhere. Such concerns are manifested in actions too: the increased
tempo of US freedom of navigation operations (FONOPs) in the South China
Sea, Japanese remilitarisation efforts, and Indian attempts at blocking
Chinese road-building in disputed territory in the Himalayas. Whether at
Doklam or Ieodo or Scarborough Shoal, China's revisionism is adding to
regional tensions. Finally, [there are abiding concerns about China's
disrespect for international norms]{.underline}. Freedom of navigation
and overflight has been a major issue, [particularly after China's
rejection of international arbitration in the South China
Sea]{.underline}. [But other concerns, including over cybersecurity,
non-proliferation, space, and even the Antarctic Treaty System, are
becoming more pronounced.]{.underline} This extends to another area of
incipient competition: connectivity infrastructure. Several countries
have now articulated concerns about China's unsustainable financing,
opacity of contracts, hidden political strings, swapping of debt for
equity, and environmental degradation. In a thinly-veiled reference to
China, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned in Singapore that:
Rules and norms should be based on the consent of all, not on the power
of the few. From Thai diplomats to Nigerian central bankers, French
presidents to newly-elected Brazilian leaders, broad criticism of
China's external policies has been mounting. A host of new strategies,
policies, and informal mechanisms are already evolving to address these
concerns. China's rise already offers the subtexts for the US and
Japan's "Free and Open Indo-Pacific" strategies; India's Act East Policy
and its boycott of the Belt and Road Initiative; Australia's tough
legislation on political interference; and South Korea's "New Southern
Policy", with its emphasis on Southeast and South Asian engagement.
Bilateral and trilateral security partnerships among all four "Quad"
countries (the US, Japan, India, and Australia) have deepened, as have
all their partnerships with some Southeast Asian countries. [China's
rise cannot and should not be contained in a traditional
sense]{.underline}. Any effort at labelling criticism of Chinese
behaviour as reflective of a "Cold War mentality" is inaccurate, if not
deliberately misleading. The language of containment imposes an
anachronistic Cold War blueprint on a 21st century set of problems.
However, **[what countries that share concerns about China's rise can be
doing]{.underline}** -- on their own and in cooperation with one another
-- **[is raise the costs of adverse behaviour]{.underline}**. Managing
China's rise should be understood not as a diplomatic euphemism, but as
**[a distinct strategic objective.]{.underline}**

#### Containment is key -- ending arms sales erodes the credibility of our deterrence in the region

**Wang, 2019**

Last but not least, [abandoning Taiwan would destroy the delicate
balance between deterrence and reassurance, a balance that is critical
to regional stability.]{.underline} Current US policy toward Taiwan aims
to achieve dual deterrence. Aside from deterring China from attacking
Taiwan, Washington also seeks to deter Taiwan from taking political
initiatives that could destabilize the situation.52 [Deterrence alone,
however, is not sufficient to maintain the peace]{.underline}. Effective
deterrence requires both coercive threats and credible reassurances. In
addition to issuing the threats, the deterring state also needs to
reassure the target state that if it does not alter the status quo, its
core interests would not be deprived. Otherwise, the target will have no
incentives to heed the threats. As Thomas Schelling points out, "any
coercive threat requires corresponding assurances."53 Thomas Christensen
notes that successful deterrence requires "a mix of credible threats and
credible reassurances" about the conditions under which those threats
would be carried out.54 [The same logic applies to dual
deterrence]{.underline}. In such a situation, the deterring state needs
to deter not one but two states from destabilizing the status quo. On
the one hand, [the deterring state communicates coercive threats to both
target states about not changing the status quo. On the other hand, it
needs to reassure the target states that their interests will not be
sacrificed if they do not take steps to change the status
quo.]{.underline} Without reassurance that their interests would not be
jeopardized, the target states would have no incentives to abide by the
deterrent threats. [The 1995--1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis demonstrates the
imperatives of maintaining a delicate balance between deterrence and
reassurance.]{.underline} When Washington decided to issue a visa to
Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui to visit his alma mater, Cornell
University, in 1995, it deassured Beijing about the US commitment to the
one-China policy. [Beijing responded to "creeping Taiwan independence"
by launching missiles off Taiwan's ports]{.underline}, prompting
Washington to dispatch two aircraft carriers to the region. In the
aftermath of the crisis, President Bill [Clinton attempted to calm
Beijing's fear]{.underline} while visiting Shanghai in 1998 [by publicly
announcing the "Three Noes]{.underline}" (no support of Taiwan
independence; no support of "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan"; and
no support of Taiwan's membership in any international organization that
requires statehood). But he overcorrected. As Andrew Nathan points out,
[this "intentional tilt toward Beijing" was
counterproductive]{.underline}. It led President Lee to harden Taiwan's
position by declaring that cross-Strait relations were akin to "special
stateto-state relationship." [Tensions quickly escalated, with Beijing
freezing all contacts with Taiwan]{.underline}. Nathan concludes, "[The
United States' policy of reassuring Beijing has also deassured Taiwan,
thus worsening rather than easing tensions."]{.underline}55 Thus,
[accommodating China on Taiwan would have the similar effect of
deassuring Taiwan and raising tensions]{.underline}. It would destroy
the delicate balance between deterrence and reassurance. Accommodation
would force Taiwan into taking risky political initiatives that could
further destabilize the Taiwan Strait, as it did after President
Clinton's "three noes" announcement in 1998. [The current US policy of
strategic ambiguity has kept the peace in the region, and there is no
sound strategic rationale to change a successful policy.]{.underline}

Ever since the end of the Cold War, **[American policymakers have been
torn between engagement and containment of China]{.underline}**. The
George H. W. Bush administration advocated the unreasonable and
unattainable goal of preventing the emergence of a new peer competitor,
as if the United States could somehow prevent China's rise. Successive
U.S. administrations were at times distracted from a focus on China by
Saddam Hussein in the Persian Gulf, the Serbs in the Balkans, and
al-Qaeda and the Global War on Terror after 9/11, but in the end 21st
century geopolitics was always going to be dominated by the U.S.-China
rivalry. Foreign policy realists understood this better than most
observers because they view international politics without using
ideological, progressive, or sentimental lenses[. China is a great power
and will act like great powers have always acted: It will seek to expand
its power and influence. Nothing the United States could have done after
the end of the Cold War would have changed that.]{.underline} For some
Americans, especially those who view the world through Wilsonian lenses,
that is hard to admit. What Charles Krauthammer called America's
"unipolar moment" was just that --- a moment, and a brief one at that.
Robert Kaplan and Niall Ferguson, among others, have repeatedly pointed
out that modern Americans disdain the concept of "empire," even though
empires in one form or another have been ubiquitous throughout history.
Americans of the 18th and 19th centuries were not like that. Indeed,
those centuries witnessed the beginnings and the growth of the American
Empire, which Thomas Jefferson called an "empire of liberty," and John
O'Sullivan called "manifest destiny." The United States expanded over
the center of the North American continent by war, conquest, and
migration. Once that was accomplished, statesmen and geopolitical
thinkers like Theodore Roosevelt, Brooks Adams, and Alfred Thayer Mahan
envisioned an overseas empire, which the United States established after
the Spanish-American War of 1898. This was the same time period during
which European powers were scrambling for colonies in Africa and
expanding their interests and political influence in Asia. World War I
resulted in the collapse of four empires (the German, Russian, Ottoman,
and Austro-Hungarian) and in the United States the rise of Wilsonian
foreign policy. [President Woodrow Wilson naively envisioned a world
without empires; where every nationality would have its own country and
where conquest and territorial expansion would be erased from the Earth.
That vision should have been dispelled by the reconstitution of the
Russian Empire under the Bolsheviks and the German Empire under the
Nazis, and the growth of the Japanese Empire in the 1930s. Instead,
during World War II, Wilson's vision was advanced by President Franklin
Roosevelt, who relished the inevitable end of the British Empire but who
was complicit in the expansion of the Soviet Empire. After the war, Mao
Zedong successfully fought for control of the Chinese Empire against the
Nationalists. The "century of humiliation," when China was at the mercy
of Western colonial powers, was over. The People's Republic of China
(PRC) under communist rule would reconstitute the Chinese Empire,
despite naïve Western progressives who portrayed the communists as
democratic agrarian reformers. The Cold War was in essence another clash
of empires, though most Americans did not see it that way. There was, to
be sure, an ideological component to the conflict, but in the end
geopolitics trumped ideology. **The United States effectively allied
with other communist powers, especially the PRC, to contain and defeat
the Soviet Empire**.]{.underline} Realists understood that Francis
Fukuyama was wrong when he declared the "end of history" in the wake of
the Cold War. After the Cold War, China continued its economic reforms
under Deng Xiaoping but it never reformed its politics. There was to be
no Chinese Gorbachev. As China's economy grew, so too did its military
and its political ambitions. Today, observers not blinded by a Wilsonian
worldview see nothing surprising in China's growing naval power, its
actions in the South and East China Seas, and its Belt and Road
Initiative. This is what empires have always done. China under President
Xi Jinping is not hiding its ambitions. [In classical geopolitical
terms, China is a great Eurasian-based land power that has taken to the
sea. The United States should view the Belt and Road Initiative as a
geopolitical development of the first order. One does not have to accept
Graham Allison's entire argument to appreciate that the "Thucydides
Trap" has a sound basis in history and human nature. **China's challenge
to U.S. preeminence cannot be wished away.**]{.underline} The only
sensible U.S. policy, therefore, is a policy of "firm and vigilant
containment," in the words of George F. Kennan written in the early
years of the Cold War. Kennan was the ultimate realist, unblinded by
ideology or sentiment. He counseled patience and prudence and took the
long view, understanding that there are no permanent solutions to
international problems. [Containment does not mean war, though war is a
possibility in any great power rivalry and should be adequately prepared
for. American sea power, its Asian allies (especially Japan and
hopefully India), and the geography of the East Asian littoral make
containment doable. What is needed from the United States is an
unambiguous policy that will not be misunderstood by the Chinese
leadership. **Containment is passive and reactive**, not bellicose, but
it demands American willpower and steadfastness. China, like the Soviet
Union before it, is a peer competitor of the United States but it is not
invincible. Like the Soviet Union throughout the Cold War, it has
domestic problems and economic vulnerabilities that can be patiently and
prudently exploited. When George Kennan wrote about containment in 1947,
he said that Americans should find no cause for complaint, but rather
should "experience a certain gratitude to Providence which, by providing
the American people with this implacable challenge, has made their
entire security as a nation dependent on their pulling themselves
together and accepting the responsibilities of moral and political
leadership that history plainly intended them to bear."]{.underline}

### Containment Key -- Chinese Naval Power

#### Taiwan is key to Chinese power projection -- unlocks naval deployment

Why does China continue to yearn for Taiwan? [The island has tremendous
geopolitical value.]{.underline} Currently, Chinese naval power
projection is stuck behind the wall of islands stretching from Japan
through Taiwan and the Philippines, and down to Indonesia. [The Pacific
Ocean is nearly inaccessible for the People's Liberation Army
Navy]{.underline}. [With access to the Pacific, comes access to any
ocean. China has worked towards expanding connection to the Indian
Ocean. Reasons for this include geographic access to oil in the Persian
Gulf, major Chinese investment projects in Africa, and adjacency to
China's biggest regional rival, India]{.underline}. China cannot easily
access the Indian Ocean given the inhibition of the Straits of Malacca
and the unfriendly waters through which PLA ships would have to sail.
Therefore, [Taiwan remains the easiest access point from which China can
project strength from adjacent Asian vicinities]{.underline}. With
Taiwan, [China could launch its growing nuclear submarine fleet directly
into deep water, effectively hiding it from advanced sonar]{.underline}.
China has shown great interest over the past decade in naval expansion.
Its sights are set on an extensive blue-water navy. The PLA fleet
recently sailed around Taiwan with its sole, foreign-built aircraft
carrier, forcing Taiwan to scramble its air force. Additionally, the
first Chinese-built aircraft carrier is due to launch in 2020. A realist
nation would not invest in such a major weapons project and display
without plans to deploy. The navy would spend its time patrolling the
coastal waters from the Yellow to South China Seas without Taiwan
allowing an exit. [China can embrace its dream of becoming a true
regional hegemon if Taiwan becomes a forward base of operations for the
PLA Navy]{.underline}. Taiwan's value to China is not merely offensive.
[With several deep-water ports along Taiwan's western coast, the U.S.
Navy has unfettered access for operations along China's entire
coastline. This gives the U.S. Navy immediate retaliation capabilities
to flashpoints surrounding China]{.underline}, like the Korean peninsula
or the South China Sea. As long as Taiwan remains aligned with the
United States, China is contained. It is easy to understand why China is
so absorbed with keeping Taiwan from further gravitating towards the
U.S. sphere of influence. Although Taiwanese reintegration has not been
a key policy issue during Xi's presidency, Beijing will not cede ground
on the current One-China policy; neither should the United States. The
region is vital to U.S. interests. [More than \$5.3 trillion of trade
sails annually through the South China Sea, much of which travels to or
from the United States. South Korea, a key U.S. regional ally, depends
on its connections to the Pacific to maintain its liberal
democracy]{.underline} in the face of pressure from North Korea and
China[. The United States' growing relationships with Southeast Asian
nations such as Vietnam and Myanmar depend on easier access to the globe
for continued liberalization]{.underline}. Many allied nations in East
Asia depend on the extension of the nuclear umbrella for territorial
security[. The region depends on U.S. enforcement of international law
and norms]{.underline}. These realities may break down if China is given
naval control over the region, and that starts with Taiwan. President
Trump's phone call with President Tsai may not change the current
balance-of-power in the region. Nonetheless, it shows Beijing that
Washington may be interested in pulling Taiwan further towards the U.S.
camp. That is one of the biggest threats to China's future geopolitical
interests.

### Yes China Revisionist -- Framing 

#### You should err negative -- even if there is a risk that we are wrong, the implication of an aggressive china means we should presume they intend to aggressively challenge US interests

Does China Have Limited Aims? The claim of a limited-aims China is not
backed up by logic and evidence. [To begin with, whether a state has
limited aims is private information that outsiders cannot discern with
confidence. States also have incentives to conceal or misrepresent their
true aims to mislead others and to gain advantages. More importantly,
present aims can change in the future as a state's power
increases.]{.underline} A state that professes status quo aims today may
shift to an expansionist stance in the future when it has developed the
capabilities to alter the status quo, such as existing territorial
arrangements and alignment patterns among states. Thus[, claiming that
China is motivated by limited aims is logically unpersuasive and
empirically unknowable]{.underline}. In addition, there is [no
conclusive evidence to support a limited-aims China]{.underline}. There
is no agreement, let alone consensus, among analysts when it comes to
China's foreign policy goals. Some view China as a conservative,
defensive power intent on protecting its territory, while others see
China as an aggressive, expansionist state seeking to dominate Asia.33
To complicate matters further, [there are no widely accepted guidelines
for determining a state's foreign policy goals]{.underline}. After a
conflict has occurred, scholars often find themselves debating whether
the initiator was motivated by security or by greed. For instance, one
hundred years after the outbreak of World War I, there is still no
consensus among scholars about whether Germany was driven by the limited
aims of insecurity or by a greedy desire for hegemony. As Sebastian
Rosato persuasively argues, "if scholars armed with definitions and the
documentary record cannot agree about what states wanted long after the
fact, it is unlikely that great powers can do so in real time."34 [Since
we face uncertainty about China's foreign policy goals, **abandoning
Taiwan to China is highly risky and dangerous**.]{.underline} It would
not convince Beijing that Washington harbors only benign intentions
toward China and seeks cooperative relations. Instead, [Beijing is
likely to see such a concession as a sign of growing US weakness and as
a vindication of China's successful pursuit of power. US concession on
Taiwan would also fuel Chinese nationalism]{.underline}.35 It is
dangerous to assume that, once Washington abandons Taiwan, Beijing would
restrain its foreign policy ambitions or become a status quo power. On
the contrary, by acquiring a forward base in the First Island Chain,
China's capabilities to project power would be substantially enhanced
should Taiwan fall into Beijing's orbit. Rather than limiting its aims,
Beijing would likely push for more concessions on other issues. As John
Mearsheimer points out, "[appeasement is likely to make a dangerous
rival more, not less, dangerous."36 The structurally driven imperatives
for China to maximize relative power in Asia will not stop at the waters
of Taiwan.]{.underline} We have evidence that accommodation encourages
more aggressive behavior by China. In the early years of the Obama
administration, [the United States attempted to accommodate China by
refraining from criticizing China's human rights records, postponing
arms sales to Taiwan, demonstrating willingness to respect China's "core
interests," and delaying meeting with the Dalai Lama.]{.underline}
Instead of moderating its foreign policy aims, [China took these
unilateral concessions as "signs of American weakness,]{.underline} and
proof that China could get away with more assertiveness."37 The outbreak
of [World War II in Europe exemplifies the danger of
accommodation]{.underline} as well as the inherent difficulty of
discerning an adversary's foreign policy goals. Before the war, many
European [leaders and analysts considered Nazi Germany a limited-aims
state driven by its security needs]{.underline}. They found excuses for
Hitler's demands and proposed a policy of appeasement. Winston
Churchill's warning about Hitler, which turned out to be correct, was
considered alarmist. During the Munich Crisis, Sir Neville Henderson,
the British ambassador in Berlin, found excuses in Hitler's action and
rationalized it in this way: "One must also try to understand the German
point of view. If we were in Germany's place what would we, in the midst
of all this war psychosis, be doing: exactly what I think the Germans
are today doing."38 In hindsight, [policymakers misread Germany's
foreign policy goals and chose the disastrous policy of
appeasement.]{.underline}

### Yes China Revisionist -- AT Defensive Realism

#### Even if China isn't revisionist, internal pressure from CCP officials means they will pursue offensive strategies

NATHAN **VANDERKLIPPE** Jan. 16, **2017** Trump, using Taiwan as
bargaining chip, sparks outcry in ChinaBEIJING --- The Globe and Mail
https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/trumps-taiwan-bargaining-chip-sparks-furious-outcry-in-china/article33631217/

Donald [Trump's use of Taiwan as a bargaining chip has provoked a
furious outcry inside China, where it has fanned new flames of
nationalism and unleashed calls for China to invade
Taiwan.¶]{.underline} A week from his inauguration, Mr. Trump said in a
Wall Street Journal interview that "everything is under negotiation
including 'one China.'" It is the third time he has publicly questioned
a principle that most foreign nations, including Canada, have agreed to
support -- that Taiwan and mainland China form part of a single China.¶
In response, China this weekend insisted that Beijing treats its claimed
ownership of Taiwan as "non-negotiable," saying "there is but one China
in the world, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China."¶ But the
moderate language of China's official rhetoric is increasingly at odds
with its own foreign policy, military and media communities, which have
grown more outspoken in demanding a harsh rebuke to the U.S. as Mr.
Trump prepares to take office. Some are pushing for China to expand its
nuclear arsenal. Others are openly discussing a trade war with the U.S.
and military takeover of Taiwan.¶ Read more: Looming presidency leaves
world of uncertainty¶ For subscribers: As inauguration looms, Trump has
lots to prove¶ Read more: A U.S. federal sales tax would sure beat
Trump's 'border tax adjustments'¶ On Monday, state and Communist
Party-controlled media lashed out. The China Daily called Taiwan "a
Pandora's box of lethal potential," saying if Mr. Trump uses it as a
negotiating chip, "a period of fierce, damaging interactions will be
unavoidable, as Beijing will have no choice but to take off the
gloves."¶ The Global Times warned that "chaos" will ensue if Mr. Trump
tests China, saying Beijing "will be prompted to speed up Taiwan
reunification and mercilessly combat those who advocate Taiwan's
independence."¶ [Such nationalist fervour comes during a delicate year
for Chinese leadership]{.underline}, as groups and individuals inside
the Communist Party jockey for influence ahead of the Party Congress
this fall, at which a new roster of senior leadership under President Xi
Jinping will be finalized. **[No one in elite Chinese politics wants to
provide an opening to rivals by appearing insufficiently tough on the
Taiwan issue.¶]{.underline}** But some in China's academic establishment
are already questioning their country's official response as being too
easy on Mr. Trump.¶ "I would not have expected it to be so soft," said
Yan Xuetong, dean of the Institute of Modern International Relations at
Tsinghua University.¶ "The one-China principle is a precondition for
China and the U.S. to have formal diplomatic relations," he said.
Without that, "according to my understanding, China should stop any
formal diplomatic relationship with the U.S."¶ That would mean recalling
ambassadors, a huge step.¶ But failing to do so, Prof. Yan said, would
also be seen as a huge step inside China, since it would suggest Beijing
has stepped back from demanding U.S. respect for what is seen as a
foundational sovereignty issue.¶ Better for China to hit back with
force, shutting down its embassy in Washington before pursuing more
dramatic options, said Shen Dingli, vice-dean of the Institute of
International Affairs at Fudan University. He called a trade war "very
likely," and military hostilities "increasingly likely."¶ "If Mr. Trump
is ready to play with fire, let's play," said Prof. Shen, who is among
China's top international relations thinkers. "We can prepare to wage a
war to unify China." That would involve taking over Taiwan and making it
a Chinese province, with a Beijing-appointed governor.¶ "We have the
capability to do it. And Mr. Trump could expedite our process to finish
it," Prof. Shen said. Do that, and Mr. Trump would lose Taiwan as a
"bargaining chip. We will teach him a lesson, that you are wrong."¶
[Naval expert Li Jie,]{.underline} meanwhile, [called for upgrades to
China's nuclear arsenal and weapons technology to better counter the
Trump administration, an idea published in the nationalist tabloid
Global Times]{.underline}.¶ Such proposals are not official policy. And
it is growing more difficult to evaluate the authoritativeness of
Chinese academics. China's political atmosphere has grown less open, and
universities have been told to exercise greater ideological control over
their scholars.¶ "[We don't know if what they tell us is truly a
reflection of what they believe or rather what they think they need to
say]{.underline} in order [to ensure their position]{.underline} and
good relations [with the Chinese Communist Party]{.underline}," said J.
Michael Cole, senior non-resident fellow at the University of
Nottingham's China Policy Institute.¶ The most militaristic drum-beating
is unlikely to amount to much, he believes.¶ "[For now, I sense more
bluff than anything]{.underline}," he said, although he worries that in
the tension between China, Taiwan and the U.S., miscommunication could
spark accidental conflict.¶ "Nerves are on edge in Beijing; I'm not sure
how much longer the calmer heads there will be able to hold the zealots
in check," he said.¶ So far, China is holding the line on calm. On
Monday, foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying reiterated China's
position on Taiwan, saying "anyone who tries to take this one China
policy as a bargaining chip, for whatever motive, will be met with firm
opposition."¶ Mr. Trump is not yet in the White House, and hope remains
in Beijing that some sort of bargain can be struck to persuade him to
change course. The president-elect is still seen as a deal maker, and
China is willing to negotiate on trade and investment issues, scholars
said. How Mr. Trump's administration will act is also not clear, given
that his nominee for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, said last week,
"I don't know of any plans to alter the 'one-China' position."¶ If Mr.
Trump deviates from that, Beijing could refuse to recognize the
credentials of his chosen ambassador to China, Terry Branstad. "That
would be the first signal to the U.S. that, no, we're not going to have
business as usual if you are not following the one-China policy," said
Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies.¶ Beijing also has many levers to
squeeze Taiwan economically, a response that doesn't risk direct
conflict with the U.S.¶ "They are very far from a decision that says we
are now abandoning peaceful reunification and have to use force," Ms.
Glaser said.¶ Inside China, however, such niceties have faded in favour
of heated conversation. [If]{.underline} Mr. [Trump "wants to use Taiwan
as a chip to bargain with China, China will ask him whether he really is
ready to go to war over Taiwan]{.underline}," Cao Jingxing, a well-known

### Yes China Revisionist -- General

#### China is a Revisionist

**Blumenthal 19** (Daniel Blumenthal, Jan 14 2019, "China is a Dangerous
Rival, and America Should Treat it Like One", writer for the New York
Times, <https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/opinion/us-china-trade.html>)

The Trump administration has been clear about its view of China. A 2017
national security strategy [document called China a "revisionist"
power]{.underline} attempting to reorder international politics to suit
its interests. [It's difficult to think otherwise given Beijing's
military buildup, its attempts to undermine American influence and
power, its retaliations against American allies such as Canada, and its
economic actions. The United States economy and its national security
have been harmed by China's rampant theft of intellectual
property]{.underline} and the requirement that American companies that
want to do business in the country hand over their technology. These
actions threaten America's comparative advantage in innovation and its
military edge. E[ven uncoerced foreign investment in technology can
strengthen the Chinese military-industrial complex,]{.underline}
especially since the Communist Party has moved, since President Xi
Jinping took office in 2012, to a defense industrial policy that
translates in English to "civil-military fusion." In practice, many
Chinese and foreign "civilian" companies serve as de facto suppliers for
the Chinese Army and its technological-industrial base. Residents and
visitors are subject to constant visual surveillance, and a nascent
"social credit program" in which disobedience to party dictates is
reflected in credit scores, which could affect everything from home
purchases to job opportunities. These forms of social control often use
technology developed by Western companies. The administration has
demonstrated some good instincts on China, but it must not be distracted
by the next round of Beijing's false economic promises. [Protecting
innovation from Chinese attack makes the United States stronger.
Hindering the Chinese security apparatus makes external aggression and
internal repression more costly for Beijing.]{.underline}

"[It completely baffles me why they are pushing for taking all those
islands now]{.underline}," a friend wrote to me late last month,
referring to Chinese adventurism in the South China Sea.¶ [China's
[provocations are]{.mark} frequently [attributed to]{.mark}]{.underline}
President [[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} Jinping[['s]{.underline}
[nationalism]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}]{.mark} another reason,
almost always ignored, is [the ascendance of [the
P]{.mark}]{.underline}eople's [[L]{.underline}]{.mark}iberation
[[A]{.mark}rmy in Beijing policymaking circles]{.underline}. Howard
French, former bureau chief of the New York Times in Shanghai, suggests
[[another]{.mark} often o[verlooked factor fueling Beijing's
expansionist impulse]{.mark}]{.underline}---[China's accelerated
demographic decline.¶]{.underline} **[[China]{.mark} faces a
"[population crisis]{.mark}."]{.underline}** This term is usually used
in the context of exploding birthrates. China's crisis, however, is the
opposite. For almost four decades, Beijing rigorously enforced a
"one-child policy." Now, it's a "two-child" world in China, but the
change came much too late. [Even if the Communist Party scrapped all
birth restrictions today]{.underline}---not possible because that would
be an admission of "one of history's great blunders" [the country would
still be facing a sharp fall-off.¶]{.underline} Toward the end of last
decade, for instance, Beijing's official demographers expected the
workforce to peak this year. In fact, the highpoint came in 2011. Those
demographers now expect the country's population to reach its highest
mark in 2028, but a leading Chinese official publicly said that might
happen in 2020.¶ [So what does all this have to do with Chinese
aggression in its peripheral seas?]{.underline} "[[This is the moment to
go for the ring]{.mark}, if you will, [to]{.mark} try to [secure every
gain that you can]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [before the huge costs come
home]{.underline}]{.mark}[,"]{.underline} remarked French to PBS's Judy
Woodruff this month. He was [[referring to]{.mark} what he called
"**[the biggest aging crisis that the world has ever
seen]{.mark}**."]{.underline} "And, therefore [[we're seeing China
push]{.mark} very hard [in its immediate neighborhood, particularly in
the maritime zone]{.mark} surrounding China, to]{.underline} kind of
[create a security zone for itself, trying to lock in the territorial
and maritime gains that it can now, before a period of much more
difficult choices arises some time in the 2020s."¶]{.underline} French
believes that [[Beijing will soon have to choose]{.mark} not
[between]{.mark}]{.underline} guns and butter, but [between [guns and
"canes."]{.mark}]{.underline} He points out [[the party has been
increasing the PLA's budget by about 11 percent a year since]{.mark} the
[1991]{.mark} Gulf War, [but there is "no way that China will be able to
sustain that sort of military expenditure]{.mark}]{.underline}." Why?
"The most important reason is **[[because of]{.mark} its [population
changes."¶]{.mark} [China faces a closing window]{.mark} of strategic
opportunity.]{.underline}** [[Its horizons are limited by grim
demographic prospects]{.mark},]{.underline} a slowing economy, a
fracturing political system, and an environment [that has nearly reached
the limits of exploitation.¶]{.underline} [A [half-decade ago, many
argued that Chinese belligerence was the product of
overconfidence]{.mark}, a consequence of the global financial crisis of
2008.]{.underline} Now, after suffering foreign policy setbacks during
the last two years---the latest being last month's unfavorable Hague
ruling on the South China Sea---[[Beijing's moves could]{.mark}
be]{.underline}, as French suggests, [[the result of leaders thinking
that they must move fast while they still can.]{.underline}]{.mark}

January 22, **2011** China: Danger Before the Doom?
http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2011/01/china_danger_before_the_doom.html

With Chinese President Hu Jintao\'s visit to Washington, there\'s a lot
of talk about the rise of China as an economic and military power. But
[the [Chinese may have only a small window]{.mark} in time [to assert
global dominance]{.mark}]{.underline} \-- [[**and Chinese leaders have
to know it**. China is]{.underline}]{.mark}, perhaps, [[twenty years
from the start of a demographic implosion]{.underline}]{.mark}, one that
will cause enormous internal strains, economically and socially. ¶ Could
[[awareness of the hard demographic realities]{.mark} that lie ahead for
China [drive the Chinese to advance their interests
militarily]{.mark}]{.underline}, if need be[, [before China is hampered
by an aging population]{.underline}]{.mark}[?]{.underline} Will
[[the]{.mark} Chinese [military, alarmed by the coming demographic
crisis, push its nation to imperialism]{.mark}]{.underline}, similar to
that inflicted on Asia-Pacific by the Japanese through World War II? ¶
[An increasingly assertive Chinese military may be providing the answer.
Chinese [leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} \-- party and military \-- may
well [[appreciate that China needs to secure its position as a great
power before tackling the]{.mark} huge challenges of a [graying
population]{.mark}]{.underline}. ¶ The root of China\'s coming
demographic crisis is the nation\'s longstanding one-child policy; that
policy has markedly skewed the Chinese population older. Not far off,
many more old people and fewer young people mean greater strains on
China.¶ Neil Howe and Richard Jackson, with the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, wrote in the Washington Post about China\'s
demographic plight:¶ Consider [China]{.underline}, which [may be the
first country to grow old before it grows rich. For the past
quarter-century, China has been \"peacefully rising,\"]{.underline}
thanks in part to a one-child policy that has allowed both parents to
work and contribute to China\'s boom. But [**[by the
2020s]{.underline}**, [as the huge Red Guard
generation]{.underline}]{.mark} [born before the country\'s fertility
decline [moves into retirement, they will tax the resource]{.mark}s of
their children and the state. [China\'s coming age
wave]{.mark}]{.underline} \-- by 2030 it will be an older country than
the United States \-- [[may weaken]{.mark} the two pillars of the
current regime\'s legitimacy: rapidly rising [GDP and]{.mark} social
[stability]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Imagine workforce growth slowing to
zero while tens of millions of elders sink]{.underline}]{.mark} into
indigence without pensions, [[without health care]{.mark} and without
children to support them.]{.underline} [**[China could careen
toward]{.mark} social [collapse \-- or]{.mark}, in reaction, [toward an
authoritarian clampdown]{.mark}.**¶]{.underline} Howe and Jackson
aren\'t alone in their assessment of China\'s future. AT\'s Thomas
Lifson notes that [because Chinese parents widely prefer that their one
child be a male]{.underline}, aborting female fetuses, [[there will be
about **40 million** bachelor males in 2020]{.mark} unable to find a
female spouse.]{.underline} [Not only does [this]{.mark} reduce
births]{.underline}, [it [provides an ample supply of unattached males
suitable for military service]{.mark}.¶]{.underline} Rodger Baker wrote
recently at Stratfor about the end of China\'s economic miracle in the
\"not-so-distant future.\" But the Baker article chiefly addresses the
evolution of the Chinese military into a broader leadership role within
the country. ¶ For three decades now, [the Chinese have been reorienting
its military from a primarily land-based border defense to a military
that can project its strength]{.underline} in the air, on blue water,
and through advanced weapons\' technology and systems. ¶ Baker writes
that [[China\'s rapid economic expansion has led to China\'s dependence
on resources across the globe]{.underline}]{.mark}. China, though not a
resource-poor island like Japan, has an estimated population of 1.33
billion. [[Economic growth and growing consumer demands require that the
Chinese obtain resources overseas]{.mark}. China\'s [leadership is
seeking to project military power to ostensibly protect vital sea lanes
to ensure access to raw materials]{.mark}.]{.underline}¶ But one wonders
if [[China]{.mark}\'s buildup in projectable military power]{.underline}
doesn\'t [allow]{.underline} for [a contingency]{.underline}. China,
[[facing]{.mark} an end to its economic miracle, and]{.underline} facing
[[a demographic crisis]{.mark} in a mere twenty years]{.underline},
**[[may find its beefed up military useful in securing resources sooner
through]{.mark} intimidation or]{.underline}**, in some cases,
**[through [outright seizure]{.mark}]{.underline}** \-- particularly
[[in Asia,]{.mark} where China\'s military would have its strongest
reach. ¶]{.underline} Stratfor\'s Baker writes that [the growing power
of China\'s military leaders is permitting Chinese officers to insert
themselves into a range of issues that the Chinese
military]{.underline}, heretofore, [played only a secondary
role.]{.underline} ¶ Baker writes: ¶ Over the past year, [Chinese
military officers]{.underline} have made their opinions known, quite
openly in Chinese and sometimes even foreign media. They [have addressed
not only military issues but also Chinese foreign policy and
international relations]{.underline}.\[i\]¶ Though no parallel is
perfect \-- and as odious as the parallel may be to the Chinese [\--
[there\'s a disquieting similarity between the rise of imperial
Japan]{.underline} ]{.mark}[and China\'s rise today.]{.underline} [In
Japan, the Meiji government]{.underline} (1868-1912) [played a primary
role in the rapid modernization and industrialization of the Japanese
economy]{.underline}. The government, along with Japanese plutocrats,
procured Western technology to accelerate modernization \-- not only of
Japan\'s economy but military. ¶ In those years, Japan developed into a
mercantilist economy, depending on raw materials from abroad to
manufacture at home. As Japan moved [[in]{.underline}to]{.mark} [[the
1920s and 1930s]{.underline}]{.mark}, so grew the country\'s nationalism
and militarism. [[Japanese militarism]{.underline}]{.mark} and conquest
in Asia-Pacific [[were driven by the aim to create]{.underline}]{.mark}
a \"sphere of influence\" in Asia-Pacific, whereby [[raw materials
access]{.underline}]{.mark} and access to Asian markets would be
guaranteed. ¶ The rise of modern China begins with Deng Xiaoping in the
late 1970s. Deng\'s rule started China\'s Meiji period, a period still
underway. By all accounts, China isn\'t yet militarily strong enough to
contend with the United States for dominance in Asia-Pacific, but China
is making noticeable strides. ¶ The United States Defense Department, in
its yearly report to Congress about China (\"Military and Security
Developments Involving the People\'s Republic of China - 2010\"),
states:¶ [The pace and scope of China\'s military modernization have
increased over the past decade]{.underline}, enabling China\'s armed
forces to develop capabilities to contribute to the delivery of
international public goods, as well as increase China\'s options for
using military force to gain diplomatic advantage or resolve disputes in
its favor. \[Italics added\]¶ [[The Defense
Department]{.underline}]{.mark} report also
[[notes]{.underline}]{.mark}: ¶ [[China\'s leaders describe the initial
decades of the 21st century as a \"strategic window of
opportunity,\"]{.underline}]{.mark} meaning that regional and
international conditions will generally be conducive to China\'s rise to
regional preeminence and global influence, [[and seek to prolong that
window]{.mark} of opportunity as much as possible.¶]{.underline} But
[the Defense Department]{.underline} report [highlights [a number of
factors that could turn China from]{.mark} the [peaceful]{.mark} path of
international cooperation and competition [to]{.mark} an
[adversarial]{.mark} approach.]{.underline} Two factors are worth
mentioning, per the Defense Department report:¶ [Continued economic
development remains the foundation of the Party\'s popular
legitimacy]{.underline} [and underwrites its military power. [Unexpected
increases in resource demand]{.mark}]{.underline}, global resource
shortages or price shocks, or restricted access to resources, [[could
affect China\'s strategic outlook]{.mark} and behavior, [and]{.mark}
might [force its leadership to re-examine its resource
allocation]{.mark} priorities]{.underline}, including those for the
military. \[Italics added\]¶ [[Demographic stresses will]{.mark}
increase in the future]{.underline}, **[[creating a structural
constraint on China\'s ability to sustain high growth rates.]{.mark}
¶]{.underline}** To the United States\' credit, the nation is
anticipating possible threats from an \"imperial\" China. The United
States has a quiet, ongoing effort to strengthen or develop strategic
alliances throughout Asia-Pacific, most notably with Japan, the
Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, Australia, and Vietnam. The United
States is also pushing a \"counter basing\" strategy, in which Guam
figures prominently.¶ [[Will China act militarily]{.mark} to secure its
place as a great power [more quickly, given the demographic
crisis]{.mark} it faces in just twenty years]{.underline}? [[That
question may loom larger sooner than]{.mark} most [Americans]{.mark} now
[suspect]{.mark}.]{.underline}

how the competition manifests "across political, economic, and military
arenas", while noting the use of "technology and information" by U.S.

Taipei, Aug. 21 (CNA) [China\'s many actions to suppress Taiwan have
implications for not only Taiwan but the world because they demonstrate
Beijing\'s ambition to challenge and replace the existing international
order, President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) said Tuesday. \"I would like to
remind the international community that this is not just about Taiwan.
The severity of the situation has left no room to appease (China),\"
Tsai said.]{.underline} Tsai made her appeal at an impromptu press
conference at 12:20 p.m. after her administration announced
pre-emptively five hours earlier that it was terminating diplomatic ties
with El Salvador as the Central American country prepared to switch
recognition to China. Since Tsai took office in May 2016, [Taiwan has
lost five diplomatic allies]{.underline} \-- Sao Tome and Principe,
Panama, the Dominican Republic, Burkina Faso and now El Salvador \--
[that have been lured away by financial incentives from
China.]{.underline} Tsai said her administration has been aware of the
possible shift in recognition for a while and has tried to work with
international friends to prevent El Salvador from becoming a diplomatic
battlefield involving the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
[\"Regrettably, the Chinese government had no intention to step back but
instead scaled up its pressure (on El Salvador), with the aim of

world, whether interfering in the internal affairs of other nations or
disrupting the international economic order, has created high levels of
disruption in the world]{.underline}, Tsai argued. \"[China nowadays is
not just a threat to Taiwan]{.underline},\" she said. Tsai said her
administration will continue to cooperate with like-minded countries to
confront China\'s international behavior, which she described as
gradually spinning out of control.

### Yes China Revisionist -- Offensive Realism

#### China is realist -- they will increase nationalist power at any hint of US power declining 

**Schweller 18** (Randall Schweller\* Randall Schweller is Professor of
Political Science and a Social and Behavioral Sciences Joan N. Huber
Faculty Fellow, The Ohio State University; February 2018)

Consistent with this logic, many observers believe that, [since
2010]{.underline}, [Beijing has been pursuing its territorial ambitions
more aggressively]{.underline}. [China seeks to assert territorial
sovereignty and maritime jurisdiction over the]{.underline} bulk of the
[S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}eas---between
roughly 62% and 90% of this sea. Combined, Chinese territorial and
maritime demands stretch more than 800 nautical miles from the Chinese
island province of Hainan and encompass islands, rocks, reefs, and
waters claimed by Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, and
Indonesia. Moreover, [China has created more than 3200 acres of
territory]{.underline} between 2013 and 2015--- acreage that amounts to
nearly 17 times more land creation in two years than all of the other
claimant states combined in the past forty years.34 [China's ability to
station its missiles, fighter jets, and strategic bombers on these
artificial islands makes them tantamount to a fleet of 'unsinkable
aircraft carriers']{.underline}.35 [In the East China Seas, China has
repeatedly prompted 'incidents']{.underline} in the Diaoyu/Senkaku
Islands. As a result, [Sino-Japanese distrust has reached new
heights]{.underline}, reflecting the insecurities felt by both countries
as they contemplate their respective positions in Asia. [China is also
expanding its influence in the areas of global finance, trade, and
aid]{.underline}. As the United States under Donald Trump retreats from
globalization, especially from international trade agreements that fail
to deliver short-term US trade surpluses, **[China has dedicated itself
to]{.underline}** the opposite strategy: **[making longterm investments
with the aim of supplanting the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates as the world's dominant power.36 Key to this
plan is China's new 'One Belt, One Road' strategy. Launched by President
Xi Jinping in 2013 to improve links between Beijing and its neighbors
within Eurasia, the 'Belt and Road' strategy will make it possible for
China to become the economic center of all of Eurasia. This is no
fantasy. Witness the Chinese government's January 2017 launch of a rail
freight service between China and London. Traversing Asia and Europe,
the Beijing--London rail link, the first of its kind, is just one of
China's growing portfolio of rail connections. There are presently 39
lines that connect 12 European cities with 16 Chinese cities.37 For
maritime transport, [China is developing new seaports in the Indian
Ocean]{.underline} and has purchased the port of Piraeus in Greece,
which it is expanding to serve as the hub of a transport network of
China-built rail lines reaching from Greece into Hungary and then
throughout Europe. [This maritime trade route is being protected by
China's fast-expanding blue-water navy]{.underline}, new air and naval
bases built on reefs in the South China Sea, and China's first overseas
military base in Djibouti, which guards the Red Sea and Suez routes to
the Piraeus. Moreover, this vast continent-wide construction venture is
being financed mainly by loans from China to other countries---loans
that will bind recipient countries to China for a generation. Through
these infrastructure projects and the construction of an alternative
global architecture, most notably in the area of global finance and
credit with the new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB),
China---like the United States in the years after World War II---is
spinning its economic power into a global web of finance, construction,
and trade, making it possible for China to become the economic center of
all Eurasia.38 Explanations of China's new assertiveness have focused on
both international structure and China's domestic politics, that is, on
both third-image and secondimage causes. Regarding international
structure, pundits claim that, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis,
Chinese leaders perceived a dramatic shift in the global balance of
power---an unprecedented transfer of power and wealth from West to East
and South.39 The perceived decline of American power and onset of a more
multipolar world, so the argument goes, have emboldened Chinese leaders
to be 'more confident in ignoring Deng Xiaoping's longtime axiom not to
treat the United States as an adversary, and in challenging the United
States on China's interests'.40 Here, **[China's new assertiveness is
consistent with the classical realist principle]{.underline}** that
nations expand their political interests abroad when their relative
power increases. Or as Robert Gilpin explains the dynamic correlation
between power and the national interest: 'The Realist law of uneven
growth implies that as the power of a group or state increases, that
group or state will be tempted to try to increase its control over the
environment. [In order to increase its own security, it will try to
expand its political, economic, and territorial control]{.underline}, it
will try to change the international system in accordance with its
particular set of interests.'41 In this view, China's new assertiveness
is a predictable consequence of its changed (more exalted) position
within the international system. Relatedly, Suisheng Zhao argues that
China's post-2008 'strident turn' is explained by the convergence of
Chinese state nationalism and popular nationalism calling for a more
muscular Chinese foreign policy: 'Enjoying an inflated sense of
empowerment supported by its new quotient of wealth and military
capacities, and terrified of an uncertain future due to increasing
social, economic and political tensions at home, the communist state has
become more willing to play to the popular nationalist gallery in
pursuing the so-called core national interests.'42 Such popular
nationalism in China is very much a product of the country's historical
legacy 'of a long and glorious past, unjust treatment at the hands of
foreigners from 1840 to 1949 (and beyond), a desire to regain
international respect and equality, an imperative for territorial
reunification, and a wish to reaffirm their collective greatness as a
people and nation'.43 A shared sense of shame and humiliation with
respect to China's experience of having been a playground of foreign
(Western and Japanese) intervention and encroachment is particularly a
potent driver of Chinese nationalism and its current behavior.44 Indeed,
shame has been a stimulant, a call to action, for generations of Chinese
leaders and intellectuals. Though it may sound odd to most Western ears,
feeling shame was (and remains) the path to escape the bitter reality of
China's humiliating past. 'To feel shame is to approach courage,' reads
an inscription in the Temple of Tranquil Seas in Nanjing, where China
signed one of its most unequal treaties with a foreign power. China
'carries the self-image of a "victim nation," albeit a nation with
aspirations finally on a path toward greatness restored. This victim
complex, coupled with China's aspirations and growing power, creates a
sense of entitlement---a combination that makes Beijing prickly in its
dealing with the United States' and its neighbors.45 We see this
cantankerous and touchy mood not only in Beijing's increasingly tough
diplomacy but in the violent demonstrations over the past several years
staged by Chinese nationalists against Japanese companies with
operations in China, causing some of those companies to relocate to
Vietnam. Today, more than ever, Chinese public displays of nationalism
and outrage---whether set off by perceived unfair treatment by the West,
US--South Korea naval exercises, or insults from the Japanese---appear
genuine rather than manufactured. Moreover, whereas nationalism was
traditionally confined primarily to young Chinese and to some soldiers
in the People's Liberation Army (PLA), it has spread to Chinese
businesspeople, academics, and elite politicians.46 This diffusion of
Chinese nationalism is the product of China's rise and its domestic
political system becoming more participative, with different factions
fighting among each other, and China's public sphere growing more
dynamic, fueled by the Internet and social media. 'Beyond the party's
control,' notes Jayshree Bajoria, 'the emergence of the Internet in the
last two decades has given nationalists more power to vent their anger
after particular incidents. It has also brought the huge Chinese
diaspora in places like Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Europe,
and North America, into closer contact with those residing within
China's borders', facilitating the continuous flow and escalation of
nationalist rhetoric and propaganda.47 And because social media can be
used to organize large-scale, nationalist protests in Beijing and other
cities against foreign governments, the continued expansion of
information technologies throughout the population promises to
accentuate the role of nationalism in Chinese policymaking; it also
threatens to raise Chinese nationalism to dangerous and unstable levels
of hypernationalism.48 Given China's determination to avenge its past,
[there is every reason to expect that Chinese nationalism will continue
to grow in lockstep with the country's increased power]{.underline}.
**[This phenomenon is already evident among Chinese policymakers,
military officials, and average citizens]{.underline}**. The consensus
is that China must eventually become more internationally assertive to
the point where it, like the United States, is willing to intervene in
the domestic affairs of other countries to protect its far-flung
interests abroad.49 Moreover, some suggest that **[the goal of global
dominance lies at the core of China's journey]{.underline}** from
humiliation to rejuvenation. The notion of national rejuvenation,
according to the conservative Chinese analyst Yan Xuetong, 'conjures
"the psychological power" associated with China's rise "to its former
world status". The concept assumes both that China is recovering its
natural position and that this means being the "number one nation in the
world"'.50

#### history proves

**Mearsheimer 14** (John -- Chicago University Political Science

Peacefully?",

accessed 7/2/17)

[An especially popular claim]{.underline} among Chinese [is
that]{.underline} their country can rise peacefully because it has a
deeply Confucian culture. Confucianism, they argue, not only promotes
moral virtue and harmony but also explicitly rules out acting
aggressively toward neighboring countries. Instead, the emphasis is on
self-defense. [China]{.underline}, so the argument goes, has
historically acted in accordance with the dictates of Confucianism and
[has not behaved like the European great powers, Japan, or the United
States, which have launched offensive wars in pursuit of hegemony and
generally acted according to the dictates of realism. China, in
contrast, has behaved much more benignly toward other states: it has
eschewed aggression and pursued "humane authority]{.underline}" instead
of "hegemonic authority." This perspective is popular among academics as
well as policymakers in China. Many Chinese scholars like it because
they see it as an alternative to the principal international relations
theories, which are said to be Eurocentric and therefore oblivious to
China's exceptional culture. Confucianism is obviously a China-centric
theory. For example, Xin Li and Verner Worm write, "Chinese culture
advocates moral strength instead of military power, worships kingly rule
instead of hegemonic rule, and emphasizes persuasion by virtue." Yan
Xuetong, who is probably China's best-known international relations
theorist in the West, maintains, "The rise of China will make the world
more civilized. . . . The core of Confucianism is 'benevolence'. . . .
This concept encourages Chinese rulers to adopt benevolent governance .
. . rather than hegemonic governance. . . . The Chinese concept of
'benevolence' will influence international norms and make international
society more civilized." [Chinese policymakers offer similar
arguments]{.underline}. For instance, [the former premier Wen Jiabao
told a Harvard audience in 2003, "Peace loving has been a time-honored
quality of the Chinese nation." And one year later, President Hu Jintao
declared, "China since ancient times has had a fine tradition of
sincerity, benevolence, kindness and trust towards its
neighbors."]{.underline} The clear implication of these comments is that
China, unlike the other great powers in history, has acted like a model
citizen on the world stage. [There are two problems with this theory of
Confucianism]{.underline}. First, [it does not reflect how Chinese
elites have **actually talked and thought** about international politics
over their long history]{.underline}. In other words, [it is not an
accurate description of China's strategic culture over the
centuries]{.underline}. More important, [there is little historical
evidence that China has acted in accordance with the dictates of
Confucianism]{.underline}. On the contrary, [**China has behaved just
like other great powers, which is to say it has a rich history of acting
aggressively and brutally toward its neighbors.** There is doubtless a
prominent Confucian strand in Chinese culture going back more than
**2,000 years**]{.underline}. But as Alastair Iain Johnston points out,
[a second and more powerful strand is at play in Chinese thinking about
international politics. He calls it the "parabellum paradigm" and notes
that it places "a high degree of value on the use of pure violence to
resolve security conflicts." This paradigm]{.underline}, he emphasizes,
["does not make significantly different predictions about behavior from
that of a simple structural realpolitik model]{.underline}." That is why
he uses the term "parabellum paradigm" interchangeably with "cultural
realism," which is the title of his book. Very important is Johnston's
contention that Confucianism and cultural realism "cannot claim separate
but equal status in traditional Chinese strategic thought. Rather, the
[parabellum paradigm is, for the most part, dominant."]{.underline} The
discussion up to now has assumed that Confucianism is essentially
peaceful and does not advocate initiating war for any reason. But that
assumption is not true. As Yan Xuetong makes clear, the high premium
[Confucianism]{.underline} places on morality [does not rule out
employing war as an instrument of statecraft]{.underline}. Indeed, it
mandates that China be willing to wage just wars when another country is
behaving in ways that China's leaders deem immoral. Yan writes, "Some
claim that Confucius and Mencius advocate 'no war' and are opposed to
all war. In fact, they are not opposed to all war, only to unjust wars.
[They support just wars]{.underline}." He further says, "Confucius
thinks that reliance on preaching to uphold the norms of benevolence and
justice is inadequate. Hence he thinks the way of war should be employed
to punish the princes who go against benevolence and justice." Of
course, [this justification for war is remarkably pliable]{.underline}.
As almost every student of international politics knows, political
leaders and policymakers of all persuasions are skilled in figuring out
clever ways of defining a rival country's behavior as unjust or morally
depraved. Hence, with the right spinmeister, [Confucian rhetoric can be
used to justify aggressive as well as defensive behavior.]{.underline}
Like liberalism in the United States, Confucianism makes it easy for
Chinese leaders to speak like idealists and act like realists. And
[there is abundant evidence that China has behaved aggressively toward
its neighbors whenever it could over the course of its long
history]{.underline}. In his survey of Chinese foreign policy since the
second millennium BCE, the historian Warren Cohen writes, "In the
creation of their empire, the Chinese were no less arrogant, no less
ruthless, than the Europeans, Japanese, or Americans in the creation of
theirs." He adds, "Historically, a strong China has brutalized the
weak---and there is no reason to expect it to act differently in the
future, to behave any better than other great powers have in the past."
The political scientist Victoria Tin-bor Hui observes that when we look
at Chinese foreign policy over time, what we see is "the primacy of
brute force rather than 'humane authority.'" She notes, "It is difficult
to understand such prevalence of military conflicts throughout Chinese
history from only the perspective of Confucian thought." [Numerous
**other scholars** make similar arguments.]{.underline} Yuan-Kang Wang,
for example, writes, "[Confucian culture did not constrain Chinese use
of force: China has been a practitioner of realpolitik for centuries,
behaving much like other great powers have throughout world
history]{.underline}. . . . Chinese leaders have preferred to use force
to resolve external threats to China's security, take on a more
offensive posture as the country's power grew, and adopted expansive war
aims in the absence of systemic or military constraints." Finally, the
historian Hans J. van de Ven writes, "No one even with only a casual
interest in Chinese history can be unaware that China's capacity for war
in the last few centuries has proved truly awesome. . . . It is plain
that China's history has in fact been at least as violent as Europe's."
[One might]{.underline} concede that China has done little more than pay
lip service to Confucianism in the past, but [argue]{.underline} that
[it has undergone an epiphany in recent years and **now** embraces that
peaceful worldview while rejecting balance-of-power logic. **There is
little evidence**, however, that **such a change has taken
place**.]{.underline} Indeed, it is not unusual for experts on China to
note that [realism is alive and well there]{.underline}. Thomas
Christensen, for example, argues that "China may well be the high church
of realpolitik in the post--Cold War world," while [Avery Goldstein
says, "China's contemporary leaders, like their predecessors in Imperial
China, prize the practice of **realpolitik**." In sum, there is little
basis for the claim that China is an exceptional great power that
eschews realist logic and instead behaves in accordance with the
principles of Confucian pacifism]{.underline}. **[Almost all of the
available evidence indicates that China has a rich history of trying to
maximize its relative power]{.underline}**. Furthermore, [there is no
good reason to think China will act differently in the
future.]{.underline}

#### aggressive pursuit is inevitable -- best research

Competition, and Great Power War",

accessed 8/5/18)

[**The historical record** surrounding major wars **is rich with
evidence** suggesting that positional **concerns over status frustrate
bargaining**: expensive, protracted conflict over]{.underline} what
appear to be [minor issues]{.underline}; a propensity [on]{.underline}
the [part of decision makers]{.underline} to [frame issues in terms of
relative rank even when doing so makes bargaining harder]{.underline};
[decision-makers' **inability** to accept feasible divisions of the
matter in dispute even when failing to do so imposes high costs; demands
on the part of states for observable evidence to confirm their estimate
of an improved position in the hierarchy; the inability of private
bargains to resolve issues]{.underline}; a frequently observed
compulsion for the public attainment of concessions from a higher ranked
state; and [stubborn resistance on the part of states to which such
demands are addressed even when acquiescence entails limited material
cost]{.underline}. The literature on bargaining failure in the context
of power shifts remains inconclusive, and it is premature to take any
empirical pattern as necessarily probative. Indeed, Robert Powell has
recently proposed that indivisibility is not a rationalistic explanation
for war after all: fully rational leaders with perfect information
should prefer to settle a dispute over an indivisible issue by resorting
to a lottery rather than a war certain to destroy some of the goods in
dispute. What might prevent such bargaining solutions is not
indivisibility itself, he argues, but rather the parties' inability to
commit to abide by any agreement in the future if they expect their
relative capabilities to continue to
shift.[22](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/world_politics/v061/61.1.wohlforth.html#f22)
This is the credible commitment problem to which many theorists are now
turning their attention. But how it relates to the information problem
that until recently dominated the formal literature remains to be
seen.[23](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/world_politics/v061/61.1.wohlforth.html#f23)
The larger point is that positional concerns for status may help account
for the puzzle of bargaining failure. In the rational choice bargaining
literature, [war is puzzling because it destroys some of the benefits or
flows of benefits]{.underline} in dispute between the bargainers, who
would be better off dividing the spoils without war. Yet what happens to
these models if what matters for states is less the flows of material
benefits themselves than their implications for relative status? The
salience of this question depends on the relative importance of
positional concern for status among states. [Do **Great Powers Care
about Status**? **Mainstream theories** generally **posit** that states
come to blows over an international status quo only when it has
implications for their security or material well-being. The guiding
assumption is that a state's satisfaction with its place in the existing
order is a function of the material costs and benefits implied by that
status]{.underline}.[24](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/world_politics/v061/61.1.wohlforth.html#f24)
By that assumption, once a state's status in an international order
ceases to affect its material wellbeing, its relative standing will have
no bearing on decisions for war or peace. [**But** the assumption is
undermined by **cumulative research in** disciplines ranging from
**neuroscience**]{.underline} and [evolutionary **biology**]{.underline}
to [**economics**, **anthropology**, **sociology**, **and psychology**
that human beings are powerfully motivated by the desire for favorable
social status comparisons. This research **suggests** that the
**preference for status is a basic disposition** rather than merely a
strategy for attaining other
goals]{.underline}.[25](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/world_politics/v061/61.1.wohlforth.html#f25)
[People often seek tangibles]{.underline} not so much because of the
welfare or security they bring but because of the social status they
confer. Under certain conditions, [**the search for status will cause
people to behave in ways that directly contradict** their **material
interest in security** and]{.underline}/or [prosperity]{.underline}.

Kudos to the [senators]{.underline} who [urged]{.underline} President
[Trump]{.underline} on Friday [to move ahead on delayed arms sales to
Taiwan amid congressional concern]{.underline} [the White House is ready
to curry favor with Beijing at Taipei's expense]{.underline}. Four
Republicans and four Democrats wrote a letter to Trump urging him to
maintain [firm U.S. support for Taiwan]{.underline}, including
[provid]{.underline}ing [weapons it needs to defend itself against
China, regardless of Washington's diplomatic initiatives with
Beijing]{.underline}. They issued a bipartisan appeal amid concern [the
White House is abandoning Taiwan to please China]{.underline}. In their
letter to Trump, the senators said the United States also needed to
consult closely with Taiwan as it will soon need major military
hardware, including new fighter jets, submarines, missile defense and
electronic warfare systems[. Taiwan is an important ally]{.underline}
and the Trump administration needs to do everything possible to make
sure that it remains that way. Former President Ronald Reagan issued the
"six assurances" in 1982, stipulating that the U.S. will not set an end
date to arms sales to Taiwan, would not alter the Taiwan Relations Act,
would not hold consultations with China over arms sales to Taiwan, would
not mediate between Taiwan and China, would not pressure Taiwan to
negotiate with China and would not formally recognize Chinese
sovereignty over Taiwan. The Trump administration must end the practice
of putting off U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and bundling them in a package
at more convenient political moments. The arms sales should proceed at a
regular and routine pace without trying to finely calibrate the timing.
[The United States has an abiding interest in peace and stability across
the Taiwan Stra]{.underline}it. Toward that end, [the United States must
support and encourage improvements in cross-Strait
relations]{.underline}, albeit at a pace acceptable to the people on
both sides. Strong United States support for Taiwan autonomy also helps
give 23 million people in Taiwan the confidence to strengthen their
cross-Strait relations. Taiwan's democracy is incredibly important to
the region as a guidepost for other nations to follow. The letter sent

The ambiguity in the U.S.-Taiwan relationship since ties were broken in
1979 is perhaps best captured by Ronald Reagan who, as Governor of
California had visited Taiwan and who as a presidential candidate in
1980, had been critical of President Carter's decision. Yet, once in
office, Reagan rejected Taiwan's request for advanced jet fighters and
then publicly announced a policy "to reduce gradually" U.S. arms sales
to Taiwan. Muddying matters further, Reagan, first in secret and then
publicly, tried to reassure both Congress and Taiwan in 1982 by issuing
six "Assurances," which, among other things, stated that no date had
been set for ending arms sales and that the United States still held to
the view that the question of Taiwan's sovereignty should be "decided
peacefully." **[Thirty-seven years after the "Assurances," a completely
different geostrategic environment faces the United States in
Asia]{.underline}**. The Cold War is long over and so too the
justification for using China as a card to be played against the Soviet
Union. Also over is the hope that somehow economic engagement with China
would gradually but inevitably lead China down the road to political
reform and to becoming a "responsible stakeholder" in the international
system. To the contrary, as its economy has grown, **[China has
used]{.underline}** these **[increased]{.underline}** **[resources to
engage in a]{.underline}** **[quarter-of-a-century long military
build-up that has led to a worrisome change in the region's balance of
power and an assertion of power in the S]{.underline}**outh **[and
E]{.underline}**ast **[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**eas. In
this context **[Taiwan's independence and security should be
particularly important to Washington.]{.underline}** [With Russia's
annexation of Crimea, invasion of Ukraine and Georgia, and China's
destabilizing actions in the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina
[S]{.underline}ea [and undermining of Hong Kong's autonomy]{.underline},
**[Taiwan will be a key test of U.S. resolve]{.underline}** [in
supporting partners in the face of great power pressure.]{.underline}
Taiwan is also important in its own right as a thriving democracy and
major U.S. trading partner. No less significant, the island is critical
in the region's balance of power, sitting between two treaty allies
(Japan and the Philippines). North and south of the island are the sea
gateways to the broader Pacific and America's base in Guam. **[In a
crisis, Taiwan could be a key partner in containing the Chinese
military]{.underline}** within the first island chain and [preventing it
from exerting significant reach into the Western Pacific]{.underline}
For these reasons, Congress should use the opportunity presented by the
40th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act to assess its successes,
failures, and the changes that need to be made so that the United States
can still fulfill its original intent to the people of Taiwan. The broad
and deep relationship with Taipei that existed between 1949 and 1979 has
narrowed. Congress can reinvigorate the spirit of the Act by pursuing a
multi-pronged agenda for the U.S.-Taiwan relationship. First, as the
United States encourages partners to pursue economic decoupling from
mainland China in sensitive sectors, it should also initiate
negotiations with Taipei on a U.S.-Taiwan free trade agreement. China's
military buildup and its provocative maneuvers in the Taiwan Strait tend
to command the most attention, but Taiwanese economic dependence on the
mainland is also a significant national security challenge. [Deepening
trade and investment ties to the United States and other partners will
be key to Taiwan's continued independent existence]{.underline}, making
it more difficult for Beijing to utilize economic coercion to interfere
in domestic Taiwanese politics. Congress can encourage the Trump
Administration to accept the Tsai government's offer to resolve
longstanding irritants in the U.S.-Taiwan trade relationship and begin
negotiations on a free trade agreement as quickly as possible. Second,
the Taiwan Relations Act states that Congress intended to authorize "the
continuation of commercial, cultural, and other relations between the
people of the United States and the people on Taiwan." Yet while
business and cultural ties have continued to flourish, official
interactions have become limited because of the caution of
Administrations of both American political parties. And while Republican
and Democratic leaders in Congress have met with Taiwanese officials,
including the island's Presidents, on U.S. soil and in Taipei, Executive
Branch visits are overwhelmingly limited to working-level officials. The
rules governing these contacts are not a matter of law but are set by
State Department guidelines that can be modified at any time. Congress
should direct the Trump Administration to update those guidelines to
ensure that U.S. and Taiwanese officials of all ranks, including in the
respective national security agencies and militaries, can meet to
discuss issues of mutual interest. Congress should also consider making
the Director of the American Institute in Taiwan, our de facto embassy
in Taipei, a Senate-confirmed political position. Third, the United
States should take the steps necessary to ensure that the Taiwan
Relations Act's declaration that "any effort to determine the future of
Taiwan by other than peaceful means" would be "of grave concern to the
United States" is addressed. Given China's military buildup across from
Taiwan and its now routine air, naval, and missile deployments designed
to bully Taiwan, **[the Pentagon should]{.underline}**, in addition to
**[regularizing arms sales to Taiwan]{.underline}**, **[invite the
Taiwanese military to participate in exercises to
increase]{.underline}** the former's **[proficiency in combined
arms]{.underline}** and to ensure that the two forces are able to
operate effectively together should the need arise. Finally, Beijing has
put Taipei under increasing pressure by closing off its international
space. It has attempted to poach Taiwan's remaining diplomatic allies
and has used its growing clout in many international organizations to
block the more than 23 million Taiwanese from being represented in
international organizations on issues such as health, law enforcement,
and civil aviation. Congress should ensure that U.S. partners and allies
understand that promoting ties and cooperation with Taiwan is a priority
for U.S. policy, a priority that will be considered when Washington
assesses annual assistance budgets. Since 1949, Americans across all
economic strata have engaged in friendship and exchanges with Taiwan.
Congress intended the Taiwan Relations Act to preserve these ties and
honor the sacrifices previous generations of Americans made to Taiwan's
success. At a time when many wonder whether the world will be remade in
China's image, it's important to remember that there is another model
with Chinese characteristics out there---economically vibrant, raucously
democratic, pro-American, and peaceful toward its neighbors. The cost of
supporting Taiwan today is much less than it was in the 1950s. A good
start would be to update the TRA in a way that reflects the deep
historical ties between our two peoples.

[Senators]{.underline} Bob Menendez (the ranking Democrat on the Senate

promoting U.S. interests in a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan question
and a strong, vibrant, and democratic Taiwan]{.underline}. In a
bipartisan letter to President Donald Trump before his visit to Beijing
in November 2017, which Taiwan feared would result in a deal at its

reminded the president that [the United States and Taiwan "have fostered
a close relationship that has been of significant strategic and economic
benefit to both nations; and our two peoples are bound by shared values

December 2017, after a PRC diplomat threatened Taiwan, Senator Tom
Cotton promptly issued a statement in which he countered, "I take
Beijing's threats to use military force against Taiwan seriously. That's
why I urge both the president and Congress to accelerate the sale of
defensive weapons to Taiwan, as well as to bring Taiwan into joint
military exercises with the United States. We [can't afford to take

In reimagining the West and articulating the problem of difference or
heterology in international relations, scholars contend that 'difference
is marked and contained as international difference' with the emergence
of territorially bounded modern sovereign states that 'defines the
problem of difference principally as between and among states' (Naeem &
David, 2004). It is claimed that [the insistence on the maintenance of
order in the international system generates]{.underline} a **['pervasive
suspicion of difference']{.underline}** as [a source of disorder,
degeneration and armed conflict]{.underline}. The 'problem of difference
emerges and intensifies under modern conditions of relative equality,
often [leading to the reassertion of]{.underline} (illicit or informal)
[**forms of social hierarchy'**]{.underline} and the [marking of others
as inferior, dependent and threatening]{.underline} (Naeem & David,
2004, p. 23). The doubt and anxiety generated with the discovery of
difference is to be contained by locating it 'at some distance from the
self' and insisting on structural uniformity. These [managerial
exercises]{.underline} [compound the problem of difference]{.underline}
by their [failure to account]{.underline} for the [injuries suffered as
a result of]{.underline} a [violent and exploitative colonial practice
of imperialism.]{.underline} Barkawi and Stanski (2012) further suggest
that war among states is 'a difference of opinion pursued through
violent means' (Barkawi & Stanski, 2012, pp. 2--3) It is the act of
splitting of inside/outside that 'deflect (s) our responses to
difference in the direction of 'putrefying hatred' and constitutes the
'political and ethical limits and possibilities of modern life' (Naeem &
David, 2004, pp. 44--45). These conditions of sovereign political
community foster 'ethically limited and tragic interactions of these
separate states' (Naeem & David, 2004, pp. 44--45). The tragic
interactions during war entail 'recognition as well as Othering' through
war propaganda (Porter, 2013). But such propaganda exercises are often
undertaken as preliminary measures prior to the catalytic event that
leads to the outbreak of actual war. This [othering takes place through
deployment of techno-racial stereotyping]{.underline}. It is
**[differences in technology and race that]{.underline}** are
[emphasized to produce stereotypes]{.underline}. John W. Dower (1986)
argues that **['portraits of the enemy']{.underline}** are [sketched
through 'gross simplification and reductionism']{.underline} generating
two forms of stereotyping (Dower, 1986, p. 30). The 'first kind of
stereotyping could be summed up in the statement: You are the opposite
of what you say you are and the opposite of us, not peaceful but
warlike, not good but bad...In the second form of stereotyping, the
formula ran like this: you are what you say you are, but that itself is
reprehensible' (Dower, 1986, p. 30). Postcolonial scholarship has probed
at length into these cultural encounters to expose the psychology that
accompanies techno-racial stereotypes of Orientalism and Occidentalism.
A 'dehumanizing picture of the West' is painted through the prejudiced
practices of Occidentalism (Buruma & Margalit, 2004). Practices of
Occidentalism regard the West with 'loathing' as a '"machine
civilization", coldly rationalist, mechanical, without a soul' (Buruma &
Margalit, 2004, pp. 31, 21, 19). Occidentalism is often 'seen as the
expression of bitter resentment toward an offensive display of
superiority by the West' (Buruma & Margalit, 2004, p. 91). Yet there is
also a desire for 'Western knowledge for practical matters, such as
weaponry' (Buruma & Margalit, 2004, p. 39). An occidentalist exhibits
awareness that it is only through practices of 'development and
modernization' that it is possible to make any allowance for any
possibility of regeneration and redemption of the Other (Naeem & David,
2004, p. 49). But 'the problem of radical modernizers is how to
modernize without becoming a mere clone of the West' (Buruma & Margalit,
2004, p. 39). This resistance to becoming a clone of the West is because
'the mind of the West in the eyes of the Occidentalists is a truncated
mind, good for finding the best way to achieve a given goal, but utterly
useless in finding the right way' (Buruma& Margalit, 2004, p. 76).
Buruma and Margalit assert that, 'the mind of the West is often
portrayed by Occidentalists' as a: mind without a soul, efficient, like
a calculator, but hopeless at doing what is humanly important. The mind
of the West is capable of great economic success, to be sure, and of
developing and promoting advanced technology, but cannot grasp the
higher things in life, for it lacks spirituality and understanding of
human suffering (Buruma& Margalit, 2004, p. 75). There is also an acute
awareness that 'the overt language of race...superseded by the new
development of hierarchy of modernity' does not conceal a 'link' that
'could be inferred by the more privileged observer standing in the
transatlantic world' (Jones, 2010). In an effort to generate critical
self- reflexivity on practices of Orientalism and Occidentalism there
has been a proliferation of discourses on 'strategic Orientalism',
'techno Orientalism' and 'military Orientalism' as discussed below.
Keith Krause and Andrew Latham (1998) argue that practices of 'strategic
orientalism' constitute the 'foundation of Western security culture'
(Krause & Latham, 1998, p. 41). They assert that [**strategic
orientalism** is premised]{.underline} on the 'pervasive and axiomatic
belief that [the West (or occasionally the United States)]{.underline}
[as a civilization has a special role to play in global security
affairs'']{.underline} (Krause & Latham, 1998, pp. 41, 37). This is
based on 'a [reading]{.underline} of the [politico-strategic objectives
and purposes of Third World states]{.underline} that is i[nformed more
by Western fears and prejudices than by the realities of politics in
these states']{.underline} (Krause & Latham, 1998, p. 38). The
[deep-rooted fear of the attacking Asian hordes and their ability to
industrialize and develop sophisticated weapons reinforces twenty-first
century concerns about the 'Rising East']{.underline}. This 'phenomenon
of [imagining Asia and Asians in hypo-or hypertechnological
terms]{.underline} **[in cultural productions and political
discourse']{.underline}** is understood **[as
'techno-Orientalism']{.underline}** (Roh et al., 2015, p. 2). Practices
of [techno-Orientalism driven by 'imperial aspirations' and 'appetites
of consumerist societies']{.underline} are '**[infused with the
languages and codes of the technological and futuristic']{.underline}**
and in '[digital spaces abound with reinscribed racial tropes and
stereotypes; these are sites in which racialization is more likely
reinforced than challenged']{.underline} (Roh et al., 2015, p. 14).
Scholars developing the concept of techno-Orientalism observe its
'**[growing prevalence in the Western cultural
consciousness']{.underline}** and [suggest that the 'US techno
Orientalist imagination has its roots in the view of Asian
body]{.underline}...**[as a form of expendable
technology']{.underline}** (Roh et al., 2015, pp. 7--11). Nevertheless
they insist that the scope of techno-Orientalism is 'expansive and
bi-directional' and ponder on the 'danger that Asian and Asian American
creators...might internalize techno Orientalist patterns and
uncritically replicate the same dehumanizing model' (Roh et al., 2015,
pp. 3, 7).

#### Using threats to national security as a justification for a policy is just another attempt to expand the states monopoly over violence -- it allows them to take extreme measures in order to shore up US strength and becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy 

**Silva 14** (Marta Silva; Phd candidate in "International Politics and
Conflict Resolution" at the University of Coimbra;
<https://www.iapss.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/201_Volume-29.pdf>;
2014)

**[The use of]{.underline}** the term **[national security should
not]{.underline}**, therefore, **[be seen as inevitable or politically
innocent]{.underline}**: [political leaderships]{.underline} often [make
use of an ambiguous concept]{.underline}, such as nation, [to turn into
threats matters close to people]{.underline} (e.g.: their physical
integrity or [the capacity of]{.underline} [reproduction and expression
of their identity) and]{.underline}, that way, [to smooth the public
acceptance of extreme measures]{.underline}. In other words, [the
conceptual ambiguity serves the purposes of those who practice state
security policies and has become convenient to implement policies
that]{.underline}, otherwise, [would have to be profoundly debated,
contested and justified]{.underline} (Buzan, 1983: 9). Feeling the need
to understand this unruly use of security, Buzan, Waver and Wilde, back
in 1998, brought back the security sectors previously identified by
Buzan (military, political, economic, societal and environmental), while
setting themselves to identify other referent objects of security other
than the state (Buzan et al., 1998: 8). The authors identified a
continuum in the way issues can be managed, from their
non-politicization (when issues are not publically debated or solved),
through politicization and ending with securitization, a situation
during which issues are framed as a security problem, demanding
emergency measures, justifying actions beyond the normal boundaries of
political procedures, and often escaping the public debate (cf.
Williams, 2003: 213). As Weaver recalls, **[to produce security
is]{.underline}** also **[a political process, and "politics is
inherently about closing off options]{.underline}**, about forcing the
stream of history in particular directions" (Waever, 1995: 76). The
securitization process begins with a speech act, because to invoke
security is the same as to practice security: "\[...\] we can regard
'security' as a speech act. In this usage, security is not of interest
as a sign that refers to something more real; the utterance itself is
the act. By saying it, something is done (as in betting, giving a
promise, naming a ship). By uttering 'security', a state-representative
moves a particular development into a specific area, and thereby claims
a special right to use whatever means are necessary to block it" (Waever
1995:55). The use of the term 'security' may help the prioritization of
some issues in relation to others, but the process is enhanced if these
are presented as existential threats (even if what constitutes an
existential threat can change according to the different sectors and
their referent objects): "[If one can argue that something overflows the
normal political logic of weighing issues against each other, this must
be the cases because it can upset the entire process of weighing as
such: 'If we do not tackle this problem, everything else will be
irrelevant]{.underline} (because we will not be here or will not be free
to deal with it in our own way).' Thereby, **[the actor has claimed a
right to handle the issue through extraordinary means, to break the
normal political rules of the game]{.underline}** (e.g., in the form of
secrecy, levying taxes of conscription, placing limitations on otherwise
inviolable rights, or focusing society's energy and resources on a
specific task). **['Security' is thus a self-referential
practice]{.underline}**, **[because it is in this practice that the
issue becomes a security issues]{.underline}** -- not necessarily
because a real existential threat exists but because the issue is
presented as such a threat" (Buzan et al., 1998: 24)

#### The alternative is a de-colonial re-reading of international arms norm. Shifting focus from securitized policy that aims to punish the Other and instead prioritizing the Global South perspective of suffering can de-link threat construction in human security rhetoric.

To analyse sanctions as a foreign policy tool in security studies and to
examine the effects of these sanctions from our perspective as Iraqi
women (children at the time) sheds light on a number of things which
remain overlooked in conventional IR. We remember reading 85,000 tonnes
of bombs were dropped on Iraq during the airstrikes and how jarring this
was to see on paper because it immediately brought us back to hiding
under the stairs and watching buildings blow up, setting Baghdad on
fire. These are our most visceral memories of our childhood and country
of origin. Aside from this military violence, economic sanctions also
meant Iraqis had to do without food, medical supplies and other
necessities. The lack of these necessities reconfigured our lives as
Iraqis with lasting or enduring effects. For instance, many Iraqis,
including our families, fled Iraq in search of peace and a better life;
this meant our families were torn apart as they found refuge across
different states. Our stories here can be an epistemic manoeuvre. If
security, which places states at the forefront, requires, as we have
argued, [the dehumanisation of certain populations at the bottom of the
racial hierarchy]{.underline}, then [security approaches drawing on the
decolonial turn **can serve to rehumanise those who have been rendered
inhuman.**]{.underline} In other words, devastating economic sanctions
that inflict [violence on a population cannot be a rational or
legitimate response/ policy to a security concern]{.underline}.
Sanctions would be, as we have argued, situated as violence and, more
importantly, **[as a continuation of colonial domination, which always
involves death and destruction.]{.underline}** The [conventional
understanding of security]{.underline} and sanctions [does not allow for
a consideration of the human costs]{.underline} **[as anything other
than collateral damage]{.underline}** because [it is unwilling to think
about]{.underline} Iraqi [people as a factor.]{.underline} For example,
Bush clarified that the intended target of the sanctions was Saddam
Hussein and his regime and not the people of Iraq. On 29 January 1991,
Bush stated: 'let me make clear what I mean by the region's stability
and security. We do not seek the destruction of Iraq, its culture, or
its people'.87 But regardless of this rhetoric regarding the intended
target, the actual target of the sanctions was an entire population that
did not elect the Saddam Hussein regime and was incapable of holding him
accountable. When John Pilger, an Australian journalist, asked Peter van
Walsum, the former Netherlands ambassador to the UN and the chair of the
sanctions committee of the UNSC, whether the sanctions he was imposing
were violating the human rights of millions of people, van Walsum
responded: 'it is also documented the Iraqi regime has committed very
serious human rights breaches...'.88 Pilger continued, 'but what is the
difference in principle between human rights violations committed by the
regime and those caused by your committee?' 89 and van Walsum responded
with a vague, 'it is a very complex issue, Mr. Pilger'.90 This
rhetorical side-step of the issue by van Walsum is reflexive of the
problem in our current understanding of sanctions, especially by
decision makers. That is, [within the context of a colonial
international system, and in turn colonial international institutions,
our human rights violations can always be defined or labelled as
'complex' or as serving the global 'common good' rather than what they
are:]{.underline} [**instances of colonial violence against bodies in
the Global South** within a well-documented history of such
instances]{.underline}. In turn, their violence, such as Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait, is always deemed as such. [This ensures the response by us is
always designed to 'punish' or 'discipline' in order **to maintain the
international order/system.** Centring human suffering through
decolonial analysis rather than human security approaches is a form of
**epistemic de-linking from the hegemonic Eurocentric colonial
worldview**]{.underline} [that currently shapes conventional IR and
security studies]{.underline}. This paper uses [decolonial
theories]{.underline} to [problematise state-centrism by contextualising
the state as a by-product of colonial modernity]{.underline}. We then
extend this critique to economic sanctions as a foreign policy tool by
re-humanising the population at the receiving end of those sanctions --
in this case, Iraqis. That is, sanctions w[hich cause mass violence and
suffering to a population whose intended purpose are to discipline a
dictator cannot be justified,]{.underline} especially because
**[disciplining is a form of colonial domination]{.underline}**. Iraqi
enunciations of the impact of sanctions can potentially disrupt and
challenge the conventional understanding of sanctions as non-violent or
diplomatic tools and, in turn, can advance alternative security policy.
Grovogui tells us, either by 'benign neglect or sheer intellectual
hubris, the vast majority of Western theorists have forsaken the idea of
an alternative conceptualization of foreign policy that might differ in
both substance and ethos from that which emerged from modern Europe'.91
[Decolonial thinking creates an opening for a substantial
shift]{.underline} [not just epistemologically and
ontologically]{.underline}, **[but for an alternative ethos for foreign
policy and the international system]{.underline}** [where colonial
domination and violence is not the defining characteristic between North
and South.]{.underline}

In reimagining the West and articulating the problem of difference or
heterology in international relations, scholars contend that 'difference
is marked and contained as international difference' with the emergence
of territorially bounded modern sovereign states that 'defines the
problem of difference principally as between and among states' (Naeem &
David, 2004). It is claimed that [the insistence on the maintenance of
order in the international system generates]{.underline} a **['pervasive
suspicion of difference']{.underline}** as [a source of disorder,
degeneration and armed conflict]{.underline}. The 'problem of difference
emerges and intensifies under modern conditions of relative equality,
often [leading to the reassertion of]{.underline} (illicit or informal)
[**forms of social hierarchy'**]{.underline} and the [marking of others
as inferior, dependent and threatening]{.underline} (Naeem & David,
2004, p. 23). The doubt and anxiety generated with the discovery of
difference is to be contained by locating it 'at some distance from the
self' and insisting on structural uniformity. These [managerial
exercises]{.underline} [compound the problem of difference]{.underline}
by their [failure to account]{.underline} for the [injuries suffered as
a result of]{.underline} a [violent and exploitative colonial practice
of imperialism.]{.underline} Barkawi and Stanski (2012) further suggest
that war among states is 'a difference of opinion pursued through
violent means' (Barkawi & Stanski, 2012, pp. 2--3) It is the act of
splitting of inside/outside that 'deflect (s) our responses to
difference in the direction of 'putrefying hatred' and constitutes the
'political and ethical limits and possibilities of modern life' (Naeem &
David, 2004, pp. 44--45). These conditions of sovereign political
community foster 'ethically limited and tragic interactions of these
separate states' (Naeem & David, 2004, pp. 44--45). The tragic
interactions during war entail 'recognition as well as Othering' through
war propaganda (Porter, 2013). But such propaganda exercises are often
undertaken as preliminary measures prior to the catalytic event that
leads to the outbreak of actual war. This [othering takes place through
deployment of techno-racial stereotyping]{.underline}. It is
**[differences in technology and race that]{.underline}** are
[emphasized to produce stereotypes]{.underline}. John W. Dower (1986)
argues that **['portraits of the enemy']{.underline}** are [sketched
through 'gross simplification and reductionism']{.underline} generating
two forms of stereotyping (Dower, 1986, p. 30). The 'first kind of
stereotyping could be summed up in the statement: You are the opposite
of what you say you are and the opposite of us, not peaceful but
warlike, not good but bad...In the second form of stereotyping, the
formula ran like this: you are what you say you are, but that itself is
reprehensible' (Dower, 1986, p. 30). Postcolonial scholarship has probed
at length into these cultural encounters to expose the psychology that
accompanies techno-racial stereotypes of Orientalism and Occidentalism.
A 'dehumanizing picture of the West' is painted through the prejudiced
practices of Occidentalism (Buruma & Margalit, 2004). Practices of
Occidentalism regard the West with 'loathing' as a '"machine
civilization", coldly rationalist, mechanical, without a soul' (Buruma &
Margalit, 2004, pp. 31, 21, 19). Occidentalism is often 'seen as the
expression of bitter resentment toward an offensive display of
superiority by the West' (Buruma & Margalit, 2004, p. 91). Yet there is
also a desire for 'Western knowledge for practical matters, such as
weaponry' (Buruma & Margalit, 2004, p. 39). An occidentalist exhibits
awareness that it is only through practices of 'development and
modernization' that it is possible to make any allowance for any
possibility of regeneration and redemption of the Other (Naeem & David,
2004, p. 49). But 'the problem of radical modernizers is how to
modernize without becoming a mere clone of the West' (Buruma & Margalit,
2004, p. 39). This resistance to becoming a clone of the West is because
'the mind of the West in the eyes of the Occidentalists is a truncated
mind, good for finding the best way to achieve a given goal, but utterly
useless in finding the right way' (Buruma& Margalit, 2004, p. 76).
Buruma and Margalit assert that, 'the mind of the West is often
portrayed by Occidentalists' as a: mind without a soul, efficient, like
a calculator, but hopeless at doing what is humanly important. The mind
of the West is capable of great economic success, to be sure, and of
developing and promoting advanced technology, but cannot grasp the
higher things in life, for it lacks spirituality and understanding of
human suffering (Buruma& Margalit, 2004, p. 75). There is also an acute
awareness that 'the overt language of race...superseded by the new
development of hierarchy of modernity' does not conceal a 'link' that
'could be inferred by the more privileged observer standing in the
transatlantic world' (Jones, 2010). In an effort to generate critical
self- reflexivity on practices of Orientalism and Occidentalism there
has been a proliferation of discourses on 'strategic Orientalism',
'techno Orientalism' and 'military Orientalism' as discussed below.
Keith Krause and Andrew Latham (1998) argue that practices of 'strategic
orientalism' constitute the 'foundation of Western security culture'
(Krause & Latham, 1998, p. 41). They assert that [**strategic
orientalism** is premised]{.underline} on the 'pervasive and axiomatic
belief that [the West (or occasionally the United States)]{.underline}
[as a civilization has a special role to play in global security
affairs'']{.underline} (Krause & Latham, 1998, pp. 41, 37). This is
based on 'a [reading]{.underline} of the [politico-strategic objectives
and purposes of Third World states]{.underline} that is i[nformed more
by Western fears and prejudices than by the realities of politics in
these states']{.underline} (Krause & Latham, 1998, p. 38). The
[deep-rooted fear of the attacking Asian hordes and their ability to
industrialize and develop sophisticated weapons reinforces twenty-first
century concerns about the 'Rising East']{.underline}. This 'phenomenon
of [imagining Asia and Asians in hypo-or hypertechnological
terms]{.underline} **[in cultural productions and political
discourse']{.underline}** is understood **[as
'techno-Orientalism']{.underline}** (Roh et al., 2015, p. 2). Practices
of [techno-Orientalism driven by 'imperial aspirations' and 'appetites

and in '[digital spaces abound with reinscribed racial tropes and
stereotypes; these are sites in which racialization is more likely
reinforced than challenged']{.underline} (Roh et al., 2015, p. 14).
Scholars developing the concept of techno-Orientalism observe its
'**[growing prevalence in the Western cultural
consciousness']{.underline}** and [suggest that the 'US techno
Orientalist imagination has its roots in the view of Asian
body]{.underline}...**[as a form of expendable
technology']{.underline}** (Roh et al., 2015, pp. 7--11). Nevertheless
they insist that the scope of techno-Orientalism is 'expansive and
bi-directional' and ponder on the 'danger that Asian and Asian American
creators...might internalize techno Orientalist patterns and
uncritically replicate the same dehumanizing model' (Roh et al., 2015,
pp. 3, 7).

#### Using threats to national security as a justification for a policy is just another attempt to expand the states monopoly over violence -- it allows them to take extreme measures in order to shore up US strength and becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy 

**Silva 14** (Marta Silva; Phd candidate in "International Politics and
Conflict Resolution" at the University of Coimbra;
<https://www.iapss.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/201_Volume-29.pdf>;
2014)

**[The use of]{.underline}** the term **[national security should
not]{.underline}**, therefore, **[be seen as inevitable or politically
innocent]{.underline}**: [political leaderships]{.underline} often [make
use of an ambiguous concept]{.underline}, such as nation, [to turn into
threats matters close to people]{.underline} (e.g.: their physical
integrity or [the capacity of]{.underline} [reproduction and expression
of their identity) and]{.underline}, that way, [to smooth the public
acceptance of extreme measures]{.underline}. In other words, [the
conceptual ambiguity serves the purposes of those who practice state
security policies and has become convenient to implement policies
that]{.underline}, otherwise, [would have to be profoundly debated,
contested and justified]{.underline} (Buzan, 1983: 9). Feeling the need
to understand this unruly use of security, Buzan, Waver and Wilde, back
in 1998, brought back the security sectors previously identified by
Buzan (military, political, economic, societal and environmental), while
setting themselves to identify other referent objects of security other
than the state (Buzan et al., 1998: 8). The authors identified a
continuum in the way issues can be managed, from their
non-politicization (when issues are not publically debated or solved),
through politicization and ending with securitization, a situation
during which issues are framed as a security problem, demanding
emergency measures, justifying actions beyond the normal boundaries of
political procedures, and often escaping the public debate (cf.
Williams, 2003: 213). As Weaver recalls, **[to produce security
is]{.underline}** also **[a political process, and "politics is
inherently about closing off options]{.underline}**, about forcing the
stream of history in particular directions" (Waever, 1995: 76). The
securitization process begins with a speech act, because to invoke
security is the same as to practice security: "\[...\] we can regard
'security' as a speech act. In this usage, security is not of interest
as a sign that refers to something more real; the utterance itself is
the act. By saying it, something is done (as in betting, giving a
promise, naming a ship). By uttering 'security', a state-representative
moves a particular development into a specific area, and thereby claims
a special right to use whatever means are necessary to block it" (Waever
1995:55). The use of the term 'security' may help the prioritization of
some issues in relation to others, but the process is enhanced if these
are presented as existential threats (even if what constitutes an
existential threat can change according to the different sectors and
their referent objects): "[If one can argue that something overflows the
normal political logic of weighing issues against each other, this must
be the cases because it can upset the entire process of weighing as
such: 'If we do not tackle this problem, everything else will be
irrelevant]{.underline} (because we will not be here or will not be free
to deal with it in our own way).' Thereby, **[the actor has claimed a
right to handle the issue through extraordinary means, to break the
normal political rules of the game]{.underline}** (e.g., in the form of
secrecy, levying taxes of conscription, placing limitations on otherwise
inviolable rights, or focusing society's energy and resources on a
specific task). **['Security' is thus a self-referential
practice]{.underline}**, **[because it is in this practice that the
issue becomes a security issues]{.underline}** -- not necessarily
because a real existential threat exists but because the issue is
presented as such a threat" (Buzan et al., 1998: 24)

#### Threat construction around weapons of mass destruction is not neutral and allows westerns powers such as the US and NATO allies justification for military intervention and strategy -- i.e. "our" weapons are not destructive. 

Neil **Cooper 6**, currently the head of Peace Studies and International
Development at the University of Bradford in the U.K Putting disarmament
back in the frame, Review of International Studies (2006), 32,
353--376//kd

The [discourse on arms as objects of control]{.underline} is also
[intrinsically linked to the shifting and symbiotic
relationship]{.underline} **[between threat construction and the
legitimation of military technology and strategy]{.underline}**. This
does not simply occur at the macro level -- for example, in the ways
that the discourses surrounding the birth and then death of the ABM
Treaty have [reflected and reinforced alternative constructions of
threat]{.underline} (or indeed, of the utility of nuclear deterrence
when faced with thousands of Soviet nuclear weapons compared with its
utility when faced with nascent nuclear programmes in North Korea and
Iran).43 Even apparently minor disputes over language reflect shifting
areas of contention between hegemonic and counterhegemonic discourses.
Thus, the use of the appellation ['WMD' as a catch-all term to describe
nuclear, biological and chemical weapons]{.underline} (NBC) is often
contested. In particular, commentators have noted how this entails [a
particular categorisation (and representation) of NBC weapons as equally
(and uniquely) horrifying]{.underline}, a categorisation that is either
deemed too broad or too restrictive depending on the observer.

What is interesting about this debate is not so much who is right and
who is wrong but the way in which the parties in this debate have
changed over time and what [this signifies about the link between
representations of military technology, the framing of the arms
limitation agenda, and the interests of power]{.underline}. Thus, in the
1950s and early 1960s a number of mainstream institutions and academics
were concerned to challenge the veracity of the term WMD, whereas peace
academics/activists were concerned to preserve it. Consequently, the
academic and peace activist Philip Noel-Baker could bemoan [US and NATO
attempts to erode the link between nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons and to portray the latter two as 'normal and legitimate means of
war'.]{.underline}44 In contrast, Hedley Bull could note [the attempts
of]{.underline} the [US Chemical Corps to make chemical biological and
radiological]{.underline} (CBR) [warfare respectable and could argue
that when it came to such weapons]{.underline}: 'it is misleading to
regard them as forming, along with nuclear weapons, a category of
''weapons of mass destruction'' . . . the depiction of them as all alike
peculiarly evil and terrifying is not unquestionable'.45

Thus, in a period when [the major powers retained an interest in
chemical and biological weapons their framing as 'WMD']{.underline},
**[as opposed to weapons with military utility,]{.underline}** was under
interrogation from establishment outlets. [Similar attempts were also
made to distinguish more usable tactical nuclear weapons from strategic
ones]{.underline}.46 In contrast, in a context where CB weapons have now
been formally renounced by these same powers -- in part, at least
because of their role as force equalisers47 or 'the poor man's atom
bomb', there has been a reorientation of positions in this debate. The
['WMD' label now lies at the very heart of the dominant discourse on
proliferation to others (horizontal proliferation).]{.underline} Indeed,
as early as 1992 Krauthammer could characterise the post-Cold War period
as 'the era of weapons of mass destruction'.48 In contrast, the
discourse on domestic nuclear armouries is less likely to be burdened
with this kind of sobriquet. Indeed, current arguments for a new
generation of mini-nukes directly echo Cold War attempts to distinguish
between diff erent kinds of 'WMD', whether it be those between nuclear
and CB weapons or more particularly in this case, between tactical and
strategic nuclear weapons.

In many respects, this does not make for a particularly consistent and
coherent contemporary discourse on 'WMD'/NBC. Nevertheless, the combined
eff ect of [such linguistic devices is to ensure that 'our' WMDs are
framed as nuclear whilst 'their' nuclear technologies are framed as
'WMDs']{.underline}, thus [**de-linking discussion of 'our' technology**
from the acute moral opprobrium and heightened images of threat and
danger that are currently constructed around the term 'WMD' in popular
culture and the mainstream of academia.]{.underline}

#### You should have a high level of skepticism towards voting aff -- none of their impacts are real or threatening but the language they use invokes a sense of anxiety towards what "could" happen

**Balzacq 05** (Thierry Balzacq; The Three Faces of Securitization:
Political Agency, Audience and Context;
<http://www.guillaumenicaise.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Balzacq_three-faces-of-securitization.pdf>;
2005)

[It is useful]{.underline}, I argue, [to think of security
pronouncements not as speech acts]{.underline} that are successful to
the extent that rules are followed by the agents [but as discursive
techniques allowing the securitizing actor to 'induce or increase the
\[public\] mind's adherence to the thesis presented to its
assent']{.underline} (Perelman and Olbrechts-Tytecka, 1969: 4). The
speech act model is, therefore, born out of an attempt to propose the
idea that securitization is a sustained strategic practice aimed at
convincing a target audience to accept, based on what it knows about the
world, the claim that a specific development (oral threat or event) is
threatening enough to deserve an immediate policy to alleviate it. In
this regard, the revision I propose here is to recast the speech act
model of security. [By integrating strategic purposes into the
equation]{.underline}, [my approach elevates securitization above its
normative setting and]{.underline}, in so doing, [ensconces it in the
social context]{.underline}, [a field of power struggles in which
securitizing actors align on a security issue to swing the audience's
support toward a policy or course of action]{.underline}. The thrust of
this article stems from three assumptions --- one, although the CS
points out that a 'significant audience' must concur with the
securitizing actor (who speaks 'security') for a referent subject, i.e.
the threatening event to be securitized--the nature and status of that
audience-- remains unaccounted for. Two, like the CS, I assume that the
very use of the concept 'security' modifies the context, but unlike the
CS I argue that such a use must be aligned with an external context ---
independent from the use of language --- to yield the desired effect.
Three, in one view, I retain the broad focus on linguistic competence,
according to which the power of security utterances derives from the
social position of the speaker; but I add that [language has an
intrinsic force that rests with the audience's scrutiny of truth claims,
with regard to a threat, being made by the speaker]{.underline}. In this
paper, then, I defend the idea that the audience, political agency and
context are crucial, if overlooked, aspects of securitization that
should guide the analysis of the linguistic manufacture of threats in
world politics. A caveat. Theoretically, **[securitization is a
socio-philosophical approach]{.underline}**. Thus, differences in the
articulation of its theoretical premises affect the way empirical work
is done. Moreover, because this is so, to mark off securitization from
speech act theory requires investigating whether the pragmatic approach
provides a sustainable framework by which to gauge the strategic use of
language. To address this point would involve, primarily, a discussion
of the poststructuralist link to the speech act in order to capture how
the symbol security is managed, understood and put into reality, through
rhetoric. This, however, constitutes the purpose of another paper
(Balzacq, 2004). In a paper like this one, on the contrary, we need to
provide, first, the theoretical foundations of the pragmatic act, and,
second, to elaborate on these bases in order to say what the important
elements of the pragmatic act are and to state how they affect
securitization.

#### The alternative is a de-colonial re-reading of international arms norm. Shifting focus from securitized policy that aims to punish the Other and instead prioritizing the Global South perspective of suffering can de-link threat construction in human security rhetoric.

To analyse sanctions as a foreign policy tool in security studies and to
examine the effects of these sanctions from our perspective as Iraqi
women (children at the time) sheds light on a number of things which
remain overlooked in conventional IR. We remember reading 85,000 tonnes
of bombs were dropped on Iraq during the airstrikes and how jarring this
was to see on paper because it immediately brought us back to hiding
under the stairs and watching buildings blow up, setting Baghdad on
fire. These are our most visceral memories of our childhood and country
of origin. Aside from this military violence, economic sanctions also
meant Iraqis had to do without food, medical supplies and other
necessities. The lack of these necessities reconfigured our lives as
Iraqis with lasting or enduring effects. For instance, many Iraqis,
including our families, fled Iraq in search of peace and a better life;
this meant our families were torn apart as they found refuge across
different states. Our stories here can be an epistemic manoeuvre. If
security, which places states at the forefront, requires, as we have
argued, [the dehumanisation of certain populations at the bottom of the
racial hierarchy]{.underline}, then [security approaches drawing on the
decolonial turn **can serve to rehumanise those who have been rendered
inhuman.**]{.underline} In other words, devastating economic sanctions
that inflict [violence on a population cannot be a rational or
legitimate response/ policy to a security concern]{.underline}.
Sanctions would be, as we have argued, situated as violence and, more
importantly, **[as a continuation of colonial domination, which always
involves death and destruction.]{.underline}** The [conventional
understanding of security]{.underline} and sanctions [does not allow for
a consideration of the human costs]{.underline} **[as anything other
than collateral damage]{.underline}** because [it is unwilling to think
about]{.underline} Iraqi [people as a factor.]{.underline} For example,
Bush clarified that the intended target of the sanctions was Saddam
Hussein and his regime and not the people of Iraq. On 29 January 1991,
Bush stated: 'let me make clear what I mean by the region's stability
and security. We do not seek the destruction of Iraq, its culture, or
its people'.87 But regardless of this rhetoric regarding the intended
target, the actual target of the sanctions was an entire population that
did not elect the Saddam Hussein regime and was incapable of holding him
accountable. When John Pilger, an Australian journalist, asked Peter van
Walsum, the former Netherlands ambassador to the UN and the chair of the
sanctions committee of the UNSC, whether the sanctions he was imposing
were violating the human rights of millions of people, van Walsum
responded: 'it is also documented the Iraqi regime has committed very
serious human rights breaches...'.88 Pilger continued, 'but what is the
difference in principle between human rights violations committed by the
regime and those caused by your committee?' 89 and van Walsum responded
with a vague, 'it is a very complex issue, Mr. Pilger'.90 This
rhetorical side-step of the issue by van Walsum is reflexive of the
problem in our current understanding of sanctions, especially by
decision makers. That is, [within the context of a colonial
international system, and in turn colonial international institutions,
our human rights violations can always be defined or labelled as
'complex' or as serving the global 'common good' rather than what they
are:]{.underline} [**instances of colonial violence against bodies in
the Global South** within a well-documented history of such
instances]{.underline}. In turn, their violence, such as Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait, is always deemed as such. [This ensures the response by us is
always designed to 'punish' or 'discipline' in order **to maintain the
international order/system.** Centring human suffering through
decolonial analysis rather than human security approaches is a form of
**epistemic de-linking from the hegemonic Eurocentric colonial
worldview**]{.underline} [that currently shapes conventional IR and
security studies]{.underline}. This paper uses [decolonial
theories]{.underline} to [problematise state-centrism by contextualising
the state as a by-product of colonial modernity]{.underline}. We then
extend this critique to economic sanctions as a foreign policy tool by
re-humanising the population at the receiving end of those sanctions --
in this case, Iraqis. That is, sanctions w[hich cause mass violence and
suffering to a population whose intended purpose are to discipline a
dictator cannot be justified,]{.underline} especially because
**[disciplining is a form of colonial domination]{.underline}**. Iraqi
enunciations of the impact of sanctions can potentially disrupt and
challenge the conventional understanding of sanctions as non-violent or
diplomatic tools and, in turn, can advance alternative security policy.
Grovogui tells us, either by 'benign neglect or sheer intellectual
hubris, the vast majority of Western theorists have forsaken the idea of
an alternative conceptualization of foreign policy that might differ in
both substance and ethos from that which emerged from modern Europe'.91
[Decolonial thinking creates an opening for a substantial
shift]{.underline} [not just epistemologically and
ontologically]{.underline}, **[but for an alternative ethos for foreign
policy and the international system]{.underline}** [where colonial
domination and violence is not the defining characteristic between North
and South.]{.underline}

#### That solves -- giving the voice of the subaltern a space in international arms policy deconstructs racialized technology and discourses that cultivates makes global violent conflicts inevitable.

Scholarly efforts that are underway [to confront the 'dynamic of
denial']{.underline} by [recollecting the role of the Global South in
shaping the agenda of arms control and disarmament]{.underline} via
Bandung and the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) must be encouraged. Similarly
it will be interesting to see how efforts towards [reconstituting the
problem of disarmament as a global humanitarian problem can help resist
the 'dynamic of difference']{.underline} [between the West and the
rest]{.underline}. Chris Smith observes how 'the development of
conscious and active single-issue campaigns is much less easy than it
has been in the West' but that [the struggle for basic rights and
development has set the stage for the 'development of an alternative
paradigm' to address problems of peace and disarmament]{.underline}
(Smith, pp. 906- 907). This alternative paradigm of '[disarmament as
humanitarian action' is based on human rights and health based
approaches to weapons control]{.underline} [that give some credit to
Global South's contribution towards arms control and
disarmament.]{.underline} But there is an urgent need within the field
of security studies to engage with the concept of 'techno-racism' and
study the parallel and intersecting dynamics of difference and dynamics
of denial. While the dynamic of difference is dependent on the Other for
constituting the Self, [a growing dynamic of denial]{.underline} with
its [rejection of the Other helps in cultivating and nurturing a ground
for nuclear catastrophes]{.underline}. Any [possibility of such
catastrophes cannot be addressed through a simple succession of arms
control and disarmament agreements to regulate and prohibit landmines,
cluster munitions, small arms and light weapons and nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} **[It demands a much more rigorous engagement with
the proliferating techno-racial discourses]{.underline}** [on 'dynamics
of difference' and 'dynamics of denial' in practices of arms control and
disarmament]{.underline}. The [success of these weapons control
agreements is often attributed to the sufferings of the people living in
developing countries and becoming the victims of the use of these
weapons.]{.underline} But [**it is imperative to question** whether only
as sacrificial victims of techno-racial violence can the voice of the
subaltern make a claim and find resonance in the field of weapons
control]{.underline}?

### 2nc -- discourse shapes reality 

#### Discourse shapes reality -- studies 

**Wolters 13** (Eugene Wolters; founder and editor of
Critical-Theory.com; He is also a freelance writer;
<http://www.critical-theory.com/author/admin/>; 8-14-13)

[Verbal cues]{.underline} may [actively shape]{.underline} [the way we
visualize reality]{.underline}, **[a new study shows]{.underline}**.
Embedded in the realist, positivist and some (but not all) social
sciences is the idea that language merely reflects an objective reality.
In other words, you can call a Taco Bell Crunchwrap Supreme whatever you
want; it'll still give you explosive diarrhea. Critical theorists, in a
variety of fields, have argued the opposite. That our language actively
shapes our reality and there is no objective reality which exists
independent of language. For instance, that explosive diarrhea may be a
psychosomatic reaction to your racist conceptions of Mexican food. Okay,
Taco Bell is not Mexican food, nor is it "objective" good, but you get
the point. John [Mearsheimer]{.underline}, in a criticism of the
language-makes-reality tradition (in international relations),
[[argued]{.underline}](http://mearsheimer.uchicago.edu/pdfs/A0021.pdf):
It would be understandable if realists made such arguments, since they
believe there is an objective reality that largely determines which
discourse will be dominant. Critical theorists, however, emphasize that
the world is socially constructed, and not shaped in fundamental ways by
objective factors. Anarchy, after all, is what we make of it. Yet when
critical theorists attempt to explain why realism may be losing its
hegemonic position, they too point to objective factors as the ultimate
cause of change. [Discourse]{.underline}, so it appears, [turns out not
to be determinative]{.underline}, [but mainly a reflection of
developments in the objective world]{.underline}. In short, it seems
that when critical theorists who study international politics offer
glimpses of their thinking about the causes of change in the real world,
they make arguments that directly contradict their own theory, but which
appear to be compatible with the theory they are challenging. Of course,
Mearsheimer's criticism is the international version of a view also held
by many other fields, specifically
[positivism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivism). It is also, if
only implicitly, a view held by plenty of mainstream commentators. But
[a
[study](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/08/08/1303312110.abstract)
conducted at Yale]{.underline} is poking holes in the idea that our
perceived reality is all that it's cracked up to be. Yale researchers
[used a technique called "[flash
suppression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_suppression)" where
stimuli in one eye will block your perception in another]{.underline}.
For instance, a flash in your left eye can make an image in your right
eye functionally invisible. But it turns out, [when given a verbal
cue]{.underline}, such as the word "kangaroo" when the invisible image
was "kangaroo," it sometimes allowed the subjects to see the invisible
image. As the [Medical
Daily](http://www.medicaldaily.com/using-language-see-what-isnt-there-251153)notes,
"The findings suggest that [perception may be more subjective and
erratic than most of us would like to think]{.underline}."

#### Discourse DOES shape reality -- especially in this context 

**Wilhemsen 16** (Julie Wilhelmsen, Norwegian Institute of International
Affairs; How does war become a legitimate undertaking? Re-engaging the
post-structuralist foundation of securitization theory; 5-17-16)

[Discourses]{.underline} are seen as structures of signification which
[construct social realities]{.underline}. The understanding of
significative construction which informs most post-structuralist work is
taken from the structuralist linguistics of Ferdinand de Saussure
(1974). He held that [language is not determined by the reality to which
it refers]{.underline} -- [it should be understood as a system of
signs]{.underline}, [with the meaning of each sign determined by its
relation to other signs]{.underline}. A sign is thus part of a structure
together with other signs that it differs from, and it gains its
specific value precisely from being different from other signs. The
assumption, prevalent in most post-structuralist international relations
(IR) work, that [discourses are structured largely in terms of binary
oppositions]{.underline} draws on the work of Jacques Derrida. According
to Derrida (1981), language is a system of differential signs and
meaning is established not by the essence of a thing itself but through
a series of juxtapositions, where one element is valued over its
opposite. Binary oppositions are not neutral, they establish a relation
of power such that one element in the binary is privileged. Discourses
are seen as made in a process of social practical interaction and are
always textually interconnected; as such, they are a set of collectively
articulated codes and are intersubjectively embedded at the outset.
Moreover, [they are continuously conditioned by
intersubjectivity]{.underline} -- because, despite being highly
structured, [they are seen not as stable grids]{.underline}, [but as
open-ended, changeable and historically contingent]{.underline}
(Milliken, 1999: 230). This aspect of discourse implies that there is a
play of practice, or struggles over which discourses should prevail.
Some fixations of meaning become so conventionalized that we think of
them as natural. Other fixations are always possible, but may become
temporarily excluded by these hegemonic discourses (Laclau and Mouffe,
1985).7 The first argument for replacing Austinian 'speech act' with
post-structuralist '[discourse]{.underline}' is, therefore, that it
[enables us to move from a self-contained and definite core concept in
the theory to an inherently intersubjective and process-oriented
concept]{.underline}.8 But also, if we consider what a securitization
would look like in the empirical world, a more reasonable understanding
would be that a 'securitizing attempt' consists of a series of
utterances. Nothing can be constituted as an existential threat on a
political arena through a 'speech act' in the 'once said, then done'
sense. As Butler (1993) points out, the power of speech acts (not to be
confused with Austinian illocutionary speech acts) lie in their
iterability; that is, they can be cited, recited and changed through
such citation. It is only through iterability that utterances have
transformative potential.9 [This makes it more appropriate to explicate
'securitizing moves' as the onset or strengthening of a discourse that
constructs something as an existential threat]{.underline}. Finally, as
regards the application of securitization to understand how war becomes
acceptable, a discursive approach simply seems to have greater
explicatory clout. The Second Chechen War and the acceptance of this
violent undertaking in the wider Russian public cannot be thought of as
a single authoritative act: it is better grasped as an evolving
intersubjective process. The purpose of an enquiry informed by
post-structuralist ST is to study how this intersubjective process of
securitization unfolds.

#### Not one speech act -- yeah no duh it's the process 

**Wilhemsen 16** (Julie Wilhelmsen, Norwegian Institute of International
Affairs; How does war become a legitimate undertaking? Re-engaging the
post-structuralist foundation of securitization theory; 5-17-16)

The post-structuralist approach advanced in this article suggests that
**[the social process that enables the legitimate undertaking of violent
practices spring from an accumulation of statements that construct a
sharp boundary between the Other as an existential threat and the
threatened Self]{.underline}** (for key post-structuralist works on
Self/Other see Campbell, 1992; Connolly, 1991; Doty, 1996; Hansen, 2006;
Neumann, 1996; Walker, 1990). In a post-structuralist reading,
**[securitization is not one utterance by one actor]{.underline}**,
**[but is produced over time through multiple texts that represent
something as an existential threat]{.underline}**. [It is a result of an
intersubjective struggle through texts emanating from 'securitizing
actors' and 'audience' over what level of difference and danger to
attach to something and manifests itself in material emergency
practices.]{.underline} This is a very different process from the
actor-centric process suggested by Buzan et al. (1998) which indicates a
clear sequence, starting with a 'securitizing actor' that securitizes
towards a 'significant audience' via a speech act in the Austinian
(1962) 'once said, then done' (illocutionary) way and ending with the
explicit endorsement of emergency measures. When security is accentuated
as part of a constant and continuing social (re)-construction of
reality, as post-structuralist discourse theory encourages us to do
(Laclau and Mouffe, 1985), securitization is conceived of as a gradual,
intersubjective process, not as an instant, individual and intentional
event. This article contributes to the efforts by the 'second generation
securitization theory post-Copenhagen School' to specify and developed
the theory into more distinct and coherent variants of securitization
and to make it applicable to understand a wider range of cases and
situations (Balzacq, 2005, 2011; Croft, 2012; Donnelly, 2013; Floyd,
2010; Hagmann, 2015; McDonald, 2008; Salter, 2008; Stritzel, 2007, 2014;
Taureck, 2006; Vuori, 2008). But it also differs from the core
contributions to this second-generation literature. On the one hand,
Stritzel (2007, 2014) and Balzacq (2005, 2011) respectively bracket what
they call potential 'internalist' or 'philosophical' variants associated
with post-structuralist traditions and champion an 'externalist' and
'sociological' version of ST. On the other hand, Croft's (2012) and
Hagmann's (2015) works dovetail theoretically with the
post-structuralist reading of ST which is presented here in that they
emphasize the productivity of discourse and the identity dynamics
implicit in securitizations, but they also depart from this contribution
in important ways.2 Because they want to understand foreign policy
production in general and how securitization effects everyday life, both
Hagmann (2015: 17--18) and Croft (2012) are uncomfortable with
post-structuralism's focus on radical binary oppositions when theorizing
the production of identity and, consequently, ST's focus on posing
threats as 'existential'. But for the purposes of understanding how war
becomes acceptable, the focus on radical otherness and existential
threat is crucial. **[The launching of violent measures on a scale such
as war against an object]{.underline}**, a territory or a social group
**[hinges critically on representations of radical
otherness]{.underline}**. Similarly, while Hagmann (2015: 18) draws on
ST despite the strong emphasis on the way in which naming threats as
existential gives way to extraordinary -- that is, norm-breaking --
powers, this framework draws on it because of this emphasis on
extraordinary force. War and violence is necessarily dramatically
norm-breaking, particularly when it is levelled by the state against its
own citizens, as in the case presented in this article. **[How such
extraordinary force is enabled in a discourse of extreme difference and
danger is the key to understanding how war becomes
acceptable]{.underline}**. The article begins by outlining how
post-structuralist ideas on policy production can be used to re-phrase
securitization as a co-constitutive process of legitimation, and argues
in favour of substituting Austinian speech act (1962) with a
post-structuralist understanding of discourse to foreground
intersubjectivity. Picking up on and specifying this broader outline,
the article then moves on to show what post-structuralist insight does
to ST, with an eye to addressing the question of how war becomes a
legitimate undertaking. I expound key concepts and relations in
securitization, namely representations of existential threat to a
referent object; emergency measures; and audience acceptance (Buzan et
al., 1998: 26), offering post-structuralist re-interpretations of these
concepts. This will imply zooming in on signifying practices, the
changing identity constructions implicit in these practices, and their
logical and legitimate expression in material emergency practices, but
also broadening the focus of study to how referent object identity and
actorhood are (re-)produced through securitization, and how the putative
'audience' contributes to this process. Where possible, the writings of
Wæver, Buzan and de Wilde are revisited to find support for these
re-interpretations.3 By way of a conclusion I draw out some general
points on securitization and war.

Scholars and policy analysts who oppose humanitarian
[intervention]{.underline} make strong arguments that the practice
[is]{.underline} normatively [indefensible]{.underline}, [does not
conform to i]{.underline}nternational [law]{.underline}, [does not
advance]{.underline} the [interests of the intervening
states]{.underline}, **[and is ineffective.]{.underline}** The broadest
critique of humanitarian intervention is really an argument against the
current international order. According to this perspective, the
discourse on [intervention is unable to move beyond a limited focus on
decision-making because it fails to examine the liberal internationalist
context in which humanitarian emergencies take place]{.underline}.
[Humanitarian intervention]{.underline} is a problem-solving approach
that ignores the "economic statism" that [leads to humanitarian
crises]{.underline} [and]{.underline} simply [seeks to restore the
international order that gave rise to the conflict in the first
place]{.underline} (Pawlowska 2005). Less radical writers also pay close
attention to international context, often with emphasis on power
imbalance. They argue that humanitarian **[intervention is a variant of
colonial depredation: it is an instrument of strong states' domination
over weak ones]{.underline}**. [European and North American governments
choose the targets of intervention according to their strategic
interests]{.underline}. The involvement of the UN Security Council does
not help, as the Council is "less than representative" and gives a
handful of states inordinate influence through the veto provision (Ayoob
2001). In addition to being patently discriminatory, forcible
[intervention encourages violence]{.underline}. Any intervention
eventually will provoke local opposition (Roberts 1993). Opponents'
third criticism is that military intervention is not appropriate or
necessary. Violence was an essential part of the process that
established political order in the West. On one hand, we should expect
there to be violence as new, weak states struggle to impose their
authority. On the other hand, when a state is overly oppressive and
abuses its population, the people, through the principle of
self-determination, have a right to use violence against the government.
That right does not extend to actors outside the state, who are not
subject to the abuse. Intrastate violence, even with refugee flows, does
not constitute a threat to international peace and security (Walzer
1977; Ayoob 2001). Adam Roberts makes the point that those who are
concerned about justice should not underestimate the power of patient
promotion of human rights. The principle of nonintervention reduces the
risk of war, respects the differences between societies, and allows for
the development of rights within societies rather than imposing them
from outside (Roberts 1993). Opponents make a similar argument based on
international law: the UN Charter fundamentally prohibits humanitarian
intervention; self-defense is the only unambiguous justification for the
use of force. "\[A\]s a legal concept \[...\] humanitarian intervention
is incoherent -- any 'right' of humanitarian intervention amounts not to
an asserted exception to the prohibition of the use of force, but to a
lacuna in the enforceable content of international law" (Chesterman
2002:2). Arguments that humanitarian intervention is compatible with
Article 2(4) of the UN Charter are not persuasive, opponents say. Even
when international law is not enforceable for practical reasons, the
prohibition on the use of force remains. In extremis, a state
invalidates its sovereignty when it perpetrates atrocities against its
citizens, but it is up to the people to exert their right of
self-determination (Chesterman 2002). These normative and legal
objections are bolstered by an array of pragmatic arguments against
humanitarian intervention. First, humanitarian [intervention attempts to
do the impossible]{.underline}. Effective humanitarian action
necessitates understanding the limits of humanitarianism: it is beyond
the competence of humanitarianism to advance the cause of human rights,
contribute to conflict resolution, and promote social justice. **[It is
delusional to imagine that an ambitious peace and justice agenda can be
met by using force]{.underline}**, simply because humanitarian
imperatives are matched with just war principles. Historically,
**[national militaries fight wars to win not merely to secure
humanitarian access for aid workers]{.underline}**. Western countries,
the [most militarily competent to carry out interventions, continue to
view humanitarian action as an instrument to achieve self-interested
objectives]{.underline}. It is not reasonable, therefore, to expect
military practice to reflect the ideal of moral universalism (Rieff
2005). For most realists, the problem is not that humanitarian action is
instrumental for achieving self-interested objectives, but just the
opposite. They worry that interventionist countries lose touch with
their national interests. In the early post--Cold War years, when
liberal internationalists saw great potential to do good in internal
conflicts by working through the unshackled UN, realists cautioned that
the "new interventionism" could grow out of hand "until the United
States and the United Nations ultimately take on tasks for which they
are ill-prepared, leaving themselves embroiled in numerous internal
conflicts without the will or resources to bring peace to any" (Stedman
1993:2). The Clinton administration did exactly that by treating US
foreign policy as "social work." Three failed military interventions in
the peripheral countries of Bosnia, Somalia, and Haiti, in its first
year in office, dominated the foreign policy agenda of President
Clinton's entire first term and prevented the United States from
focusing on its vital interests (Mandelbaum 1996). In addition to
distracting governments from national interests, opponents say that
humanitarian intervention is inherently difficult and likely to fail. At
best, [even a large military force can do only a little
good]{.underline} (Posen 1996). When political leaders commit themselves
to humanitarian intervention, they must recognize that they are engaged
in a military operation where one or more armed parties do not consent
to a foreign military presence. They should be ready for a fight, [as
experiences in Somalia, Bosnia, and the D]{.underline}emocratic
[R]{.underline}epublic of the [C]{.underline}ongo show. [Intervening
troops attempt to deter attacks on civilians and aid operations, or to
compel gunmen to stop attacks after they have begun]{.underline} (a
harder task), [but the attempt often fails]{.underline}. [When
deterrence fails, interveners must choose between standing by as
atrocities occur]{.underline} ([like]{.underline} the Dutch UN battalion
[in]{.underline} Srebrenica, [Bosnia)]{.underline} [and using deadly
force against the attackers]{.underline} ([like]{.underline} the
Australians [in East Timor]{.underline}). According to this view,
intervening forces should be able to dominate the battlefield in order
to attain their objectives quickly with as few casualties as possible.
Dominating the battlefield almost always requires significant air and
ground forces and a large logistical infrastructure to support them
(Seybolt 2007). **[Rarely have governments committed the necessary
resources for short-term success, much less for the complex phase of
rebuilding shattered societies.]{.underline}** While realist opponents
see danger to national interests when militaries get involved in
humanitarian efforts, recent practice has turned this around, and has
confirmed the worst fears of humanitarian opponents. In Afghanistan and
Iraq, the US government considered humanitarian work to be "a force
multiplier" -- a term usually used for things that confer military
advantage, such as a good intelligence system or a strong logistics
train. Using humanitarian aid for political ends in a conflict zone was
an explicit objective of the Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) that
American and allied troops first established in Afghanistan in 2002.
Military personnel, with some civilians, staff PRTs with the aim of
improving local governance and doing quick impact development projects
to win hearts and minds (Perito 2005). Many humanitarian practitioners
argue that the economic development activities of military personnel in
PRTs challenge the humanitarian principles of impartiality, operational
neutrality, and independence. There is only weak evidence to suggest
that the principles are challenged, according to a study by an author
sympathetic to the humanitarian view, but the purposes the principles
are meant to serve -- safety and access -- have suffered. Politically
motivated attacks on humanitarian workers in Afghanistan and Iraq
increased and the amount of coordination with humanitarian
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) decreased, making aid operations
less efficient (Harmer 2008). Finally, opponents contend that the
concept of the responsibility to protect is untenable. Its critical
weakness is that reaction to atrocities has been framed as coercive
protection that can be undertaken without the consent of the host
government. Preventive measures and noncoercive persuasion have been
ignored. This interpretation demands an international protection
capability that does not now exist and cannot realistically be expected.
The case of Darfur highlights the operational and strategic shortcomings
of the concept. The African Union Mission in Sudan and its successor,
the UN--African Union Mission in Sudan, lack the ability to protect
civilians. Worse, their deployment distorted the negotiation process and
made resolution of the conflict more difficult (De Waal 2007).

### L -- threats construction 

#### Using threats to national security as a justification for a policy is just another attempt to expand the states monopoly over violence -- it allows them to take extreme measures in order to shore up US strength and becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy 

**Silva 14** (Marta Silva; Phd candidate in "International Politics and
Conflict Resolution" at the University of Coimbra;
<https://www.iapss.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/201_Volume-29.pdf>;
2014)

**[The use of]{.underline}** the term **[national security should
not]{.underline}**, therefore, **[be seen as inevitable or politically
innocent]{.underline}**: [political leaderships]{.underline} often [make
use of an ambiguous concept]{.underline}, such as nation, [to turn into
threats matters close to people]{.underline} (e.g.: their physical
integrity or [the capacity of]{.underline} [reproduction and expression
of their identity) and]{.underline}, that way, [to smooth the public
acceptance of extreme measures]{.underline}. In other words, [the
conceptual ambiguity serves the purposes of those who practice state
security policies and has become convenient to implement policies
that]{.underline}, otherwise, [would have to be profoundly debated,
contested and justified]{.underline} (Buzan, 1983: 9). Feeling the need
to understand this unruly use of security, Buzan, Waver and Wilde, back
in 1998, brought back the security sectors previously identified by
Buzan (military, political, economic, societal and environmental), while
setting themselves to identify other referent objects of security other
than the state (Buzan et al., 1998: 8). The authors identified a
continuum in the way issues can be managed, from their
non-politicization (when issues are not publically debated or solved),
through politicization and ending with securitization, a situation
during which issues are framed as a security problem, demanding
emergency measures, justifying actions beyond the normal boundaries of
political procedures, and often escaping the public debate (cf.
Williams, 2003: 213). As Weaver recalls, **[to produce security
is]{.underline}** also **[a political process, and "politics is
inherently about closing off options]{.underline}**, about forcing the
stream of history in particular directions" (Waever, 1995: 76). The
securitization process begins with a speech act, because to invoke
security is the same as to practice security: "\[...\] we can regard
'security' as a speech act. In this usage, security is not of interest
as a sign that refers to something more real; the utterance itself is
the act. By saying it, something is done (as in betting, giving a
promise, naming a ship). By uttering 'security', a state-representative
moves a particular development into a specific area, and thereby claims
a special right to use whatever means are necessary to block it" (Waever
1995:55). The use of the term 'security' may help the prioritization of
some issues in relation to others, but the process is enhanced if these
are presented as existential threats (even if what constitutes an
existential threat can change according to the different sectors and
their referent objects): "[If one can argue that something overflows the
normal political logic of weighing issues against each other, this must
be the cases because it can upset the entire process of weighing as
such: 'If we do not tackle this problem, everything else will be
irrelevant]{.underline} (because we will not be here or will not be free
to deal with it in our own way).' Thereby, **[the actor has claimed a
right to handle the issue through extraordinary means, to break the
normal political rules of the game]{.underline}** (e.g., in the form of
secrecy, levying taxes of conscription, placing limitations on otherwise
inviolable rights, or focusing society's energy and resources on a
specific task). **['Security' is thus a self-referential
practice]{.underline}**, **[because it is in this practice that the
issue becomes a security issues]{.underline}** -- not necessarily
because a real existential threat exists but because the issue is
presented as such a threat" (Buzan et al., 1998: 24)

### L - nuclear exceptionalism/proliferation 

#### The 1ac re-entrenches racialized difference by presenting proliferation of weapons as a threat in the hands of non-western countries and nations, reproducing colonial ideologies that seek to annihilate the Other.

But unlike strategic Orientalism and techno-Orientalism, Military
Orientalism is described as an exercise undertaken to investigate the
mental baggage of [Western consciousness accumulated from an interest in
'non-Western warfare']{.underline} (Porter, 2013, pp. 16--17). The
[endeavor]{.underline} of [military Orientalism]{.underline} is to
unpack [the 'range of assumptions and myths through which Westerners
**gaze on the military East**]{.underline} [and engage in a]{.underline}
critical **[dialogue with our own preconceptions']{.underline}**
(Porter, 2013, pp. 16--17). It encourages Westerners to voice their own
'fears about themselves, their survival, identity and values, through
different visions of non-Western warfare' (Porter, 2013, p. 21).
Military Orientalism issues a warning against reducing military history
to a morality play (Porter, 2013, p. 75). But it is open to the idea
that our common experiences of suffering can help cultivate a 'source of
critical self-reflection to perhaps nurture some understanding of the
'intimacy of the relationship' (Naeem & David, 2004, p. 187; Nandy,
1983). In investigating the intimacy of a relationship it might be
possible to glean and 'retrieve recessive images and practices' that
have been historically constituted through a network of social relations
and processes (Naeem & David, 2004, p. 191). These might present
creative opportunities to move beyond 'policing boundaries of self as an
exclusive and homogenous space' and instead 'appreciate and claim the
self that exists as part of the other beyond those boundaries' (Naeem &
David, 2004, p. 204). Porter insists on 'the interactive and
power-political nature of war, which has a culture of its own that can
change all parties to a conflict' (2013, p. 55). Porter claims that,
'paradoxically, war can drive cultures closer together' (2013, p. 33).
This is because, 'war...is not simply a clash of Others, made possible
by an ignorant horror of difference. The warrior looks out at the enemy
and sees men who are, in crucial respects, recognizably like himself'
(Porter, 2013, p. 34). He also argues that an engagement with, 'the
foreign "Other" can be treated as a superior model to inform
self-examination' (2013, p. 108). But this hopeful promise of [Military
Orientalism has not stemmed]{.underline} the tide of [populist
discourses deploying the dynamic of difference between **'The West and
the Rest'**]{.underline} in the aftermath of the Cold War to wage [and
**perpetuate a global War on Terror**]{.underline}. On the contrary it
is possible to argue that [there is deliberate and contingent
deployment]{.underline} of a '[decivilizing rhetoric that blends
irrational, aggressive, rigid, paranoid and exceptionalist discourses to
demonize Other-ness]{.underline}' and [give 'unwarranted authority and
autonomy']{.underline} **[to 'militarist and imperialist discourses of
national security']{.underline}** (Taylor, 2007, p. 670). There is
'**[sustained use of decivilizing imagery']{.underline}** that
'[represents the United States as a virtuous nation reluctantly but
legitimately fulfilling its divine mandate to use civilized reason and
superior force' vis-a vis 'nuclear capable and aspiring nations in Asia,
Africa and the Middle East' depicted in a 'racist, sexist language that
reproduces colonial ideology]{.underline}. As such [**it rejects the
authority and legitimacy of these nations as potential possessors of
nuclear weapons** and solidifies continued dominance by the United
States]{.underline} of the nuclear strategic environment' (Taylor, 2007,
p. 685). The strength of these populist [discourses reinforcing a
dynamic of difference and denial]{.underline} is [exhibited
with]{.underline} the contemporary 'malpractice' of [the Trump
administration to not respect the nuclear deal negotiated with
Iran]{.underline} (Kimball, 2018). [Nuclear weapons have long been
regarded as 'a new technological deity' and 'a divinely offered gift
that endorsed American exceptionalism and imbued its creators with
God-like power and the mission to restore order and justice in a fallen
world.']{.underline} (Taylor, 2007, p. 677). Gabrielle Hecht (2012)
defines **[nuclear exceptionalism as 'insistence on an essential nuclear
difference]{.underline}** -- [manifested in political claims,
technological systems, cultural forms, institutional infrastructures,
and scientific knowledge']{.underline} and insists 'nuclear
exceptionalism could be made, unmade, and remade' as 'for all efforts at
making nuclear things exceptional, there were opposing attempts to
render them banal' (Hecht, pp. 6-- 8). It is important to bear this in
mind as this [pernicious dynamic of difference and exceptionalism
becomes even more acute with current US President Donald Trump's
everyday populist declarations]{.underline}. He is on record for
[stating that the US will be at the 'top of the pack' 'until such time
as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes']{.underline} (Holland,
2017). In his recent visit to Poland 'to summon the courage and the will
to defend our civilization' Trump (2017) claims 'there are dire threats
to our security and our way of life' and argues, 'the fundamental
question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive.' There
is little doubt in his mind of the 'triumph' of the West (Holland,
2017). It is therefore helpful to pause in this tumultuous 'history of
the present' and suggest that 'every identity owes a debt to alterity'
(Naeem & David, 2004, p. 8). Thus it is interesting to observe how the
existing literature on 'dynamic of difference' between Orientalism and
Occidentalism has expanded its arsenal with a more complex conceptual
apparatus of Strategic Orientalism, Techno Orientalism and Military
Orientalism to helps us grasp the everyday practices of techno-racial
dynamic of differences that cultivate and nurture techno-racial
stereotypes. These stereotypes more often than not [dictate modes of
behavior that make the Other 'a monster that must not only be defeated
but also utterly destroyed]{.underline}...an enemy who no longer must be
compelled to retreat into his borders only' (Schmitt, 2007). It is this
'**[dynamic of difference' with its persistent desire to annihilate the
Other,]{.underline}** makes one wonder, whether it is not [a
complementary sub-text for an increasingly alarming and growing
superstructure of a 'dynamic of denial' in weapons control]{.underline}?
A dynamic of denial so petulant that it casts its shadow in celebrating
the recent success of a Nuclear Weapons Ban Treaty (2017).

### L -- China 

#### We shouldn't securitize China 

**Chandler et al 18** (David Chandler Westminster University, London, UK
Erika Cudworth University of East London, London, UK Stephen Hobden
University of East London, London, UK; Anthropocene, Capitalocene and
Liberal Cosmopolitan IR: A Response to Burke et al.'s 'Planet Politics';
Millennium: Journal of International Studies 2018, Vol. 46(2) 190 --208;
2018)

While the Manifesto's authors claim that they seek to fire a new
'political imagination' and to bring a 'new urgency' that is beyond
'politics as usual',55 the problem is less that the claims are utopian
than that they are a recipe for reinforcing the disciplinary hierarchies
just when they appear to be eroding. The 'Manifesto' faces exactly the
same problems as those already rehearsed in the critiques levelled
against the global cosmopolitan theorists: as long as we live under
capitalism the measures argued for would never succeed or, if they did,
they would only be used selectively to reinforce dominant power
relations. As Drucilla Cornell and Stephen Seely have noted recently, we
need to be extending human freedoms rather than seeking bureaucratically
and hierarchically to limit them. [The threats of global extinction and
global warming should not be used to pose a 'forced choice' of 'the
planet' or 'politics']{.underline}.56 [Giving up on]{.underline} the
human (of [liberal modernity]{.underline}) [does not]{.underline}
necessarily [imply]{.underline} that [we give up on humanist
aspirations]{.underline} [for]{.underline} radical [change and
revolutionary possibilities]{.underline} [and install]{.underline}
global [courts and legislators to act as enlightened
overlords]{.underline}, squashing democratic debate on the basis that
they can hear 'what the planet is telling us' to do. Thus, the greater
concern for us, of course, is the real impact of such a Manifesto: **[an
elitist and managerialist assault on the political imagination, which
has little to do with academic discussion and debate about whether and
how to go 'beyond IR' or beyond modernist constructions of the human
subject]{.underline}**. This is why, when you scratch the surface, what
is revealed is actually an anti-political manifesto: a call for the
abolition of politics. In their demand for urgent action on universal
moral grounds any attempt to discuss the stakes involved are sidelined
rather than encouraged. Therefore, it is little surprise that, in their
recent piece, Burke and Fishel blithely conclude: 'We are aware that
these are radical ideas that raise significant political and legal
complexities... Planet Earth needs unprecedented politics for these
unprecedented times'. Against this position, we would suggest a
'Non-Manifesto for the Capitalocene', one that encourages debate rather
than closing down discussion with calls for focusing on establishing new
legal and institutional frameworks of global security governance. While
the term 'Anthropocene' has entered common usage, we are concerned that
its use can confuse the issues rather than illuminate them.57 The term
once again puts an emphasis on the 'anthropo', the human. And while
Crutzen and Stoermer justifiably sought to draw attention to the human
impact on the planet, there is a danger that this reinforces the view of
the human as all-powerful and separate from the rest of nature.
Furthermore, it is not the 'human', that is the cause of the impacts on
the rest of nature, but a specific subset of the human, living within a
particular form of social organisation. Yet, as Stengers reminds us, the
planet does not discriminate. The specific subset of the human and their
ways of life will not be somehow targeted by planetary feedback loops.
Rather, it is the most vulnerable humans and other animals who will be
and are already bearing the first effects of the intrusion of Gaia. As
Roy Scranton puts it: 'We're fucked. The only questions are how soon and
how badly'.58 In emphasising **[a 'Non-Manifesto]{.underline}** for the
Capitalocene', we **[would]{.underline}**, first, **[refuse to rush to
support global securitising measures of any sort]{.underline}**, any
more than we would support state declarations of 'states of emergency'
or 'emergency powers'. Second, we think that politics cannot and should
not be reduced to 'the preservation and repair of ecological systems'.
It is a shame that the 'Planetary Manifesto' forces debate onto the
technical terms of what steps should or could be taken by global
(planetary) governance bodies and how feasible any such establishment of
these bodies might be and their political consequences. Intellectually
this discussion is no less problematic than debating earlier ideas for
world government or global governance in the past, and we are not the
first authors to highlight its 'deeply authoritarian and de-politicising
tendencies'.59 The Capitalocene and the End of IR The proposal of a
'[Non-Manifesto' is]{.underline} purely [a heuristic device to make
clear that we]{.underline} definitely [do not want to engage in the
debate on the policy-making terms]{.underline} set by Burke et al. **[It
is not a call for inaction]{.underline}**. [However]{.underline}, the
idea of the 'Non-Manifesto' flags up the demand that [we make a
refusal]{.underline}: a refusal [to fall back into reinforcing the
international arena as the source of politics and
policy-making]{.underline}. The Capitalocene actually makes a major
challenge to IR, one that is not taken at all seriously by Burke et al.
Indeed, [it challenges the possibility of governing from the top-down
through questioning the modernist understanding of the
world]{.underline}. For all their talk of the 'complex enmeshment of
human and nonhuman life in the planetary biosphere', Burke et al.
demonstrate little awareness of the consequences of this embeddedness
for the policy making they suggest or what is at stake for the
discipline of IR itself. IR is a discipline concerned with policy making
-- the policy making of the inter-state sphere and the projection of
policy intentions in the international arena. Until the 1990s, this was
a fairly minor academic concern and domestic politics and the discipline
of political theory were seen as much more important. IR as a discipline
boomed in the 1990s as the barriers between the domestic and the
international appeared to be blurring (this was what led some academics
to think that the days of the national state were over and the future
was that of global governance). However, the [fantasy of reproducing the
state at the global level failed and what we witnessed wa]{.underline}s
not the homogenising of the liberal order globally but rather [the
implosion of this order]{.underline}.

#### China threat construction causes US policies of containment, turning deterrence and increasing the probability of a nuclear war via prolif. The alternative is (a movement/self-reflection?) that questions (Western/US?) positivism.

**Pan, 2004**

Chengxin, Associate Professor of IR at Deakin University, Doctor of
Philosophy from Australian National University, and Master of
International Studies from Peking University, "The 'China Threat' in
American Self-Imagination: The Discursive Construction of Other as Power
Politics," 2004, 6/27/19,
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/030437540402900304//WS

I have argued above that [the \"China threat\" argument in mainstream
U.S. IR literature is derived,]{.underline} primarily[, from a
discursive construction of otherness.]{.underline} [This construction is
predicated on a particular narcissistic understanding of the U.S. self
and on a positivist-based realism, concerned with absolute certainty and
security]{.underline}, a concern central to the dominant U.S.
self-imaginary. Within these frameworks, it seems imperative that China
be treated as a threatening, absolute other since it is unable to fit
neatly into the U.S.-led evolutionary scheme or guarantee absolute
security for the United States, so that U.S. power preponderance in the
post-Cold War world can still be legitimated. Not only does [this
reductionist representation come at the expense of understanding China
as a dynamic, multifaceted country but it leads inevitably to a policy
of containment that,]{.underline} in turn[, tends to enhance the
influence of realpolitik thinking, nationalist extremism, and hard-line
stance in today\'s China]{.underline}. [Even a small dose of the
containment strategy is likely to have a highly dramatic impact on
U.S.-China relations, as the 1995-1996 missile crisis and the 2001
spy-plane incident have vividly attested]{.underline}. In this respect,
Chalmers Johnson is right when he suggests that \"[a policy of
containment toward China implies the possibility of war,]{.underline}
just as it did during the Cold War vis-à-vis the former Soviet Union.
[The balance of terror prevented war between the United States and the
Soviet Union, but this may not work in the case of
China]{.underline}.\"93 For instance, [as the United States presses
ahead with a missile-defence shield to \"guarantee\" its invulnerability
from rather unlikely sources of missile attacks, it would be almost
certain to intensify China\'s sense of vulnerability and compel it to
expand its current small nuclear arsenal so as to maintain the
efficiency of its limited deterrence]{.underline}. In consequence, [it
is not impossible that the two countries, and possibly the whole region,
might be dragged into an escalating arms race that would eventually make
war more likely.]{.underline} Neither the United States nor China is
likely to be keen on fighting the other. But as has been demonstrated,
[the \"China threat\" argument]{.underline}, for all its alleged desire
for peace and security, [tends to make war preparedness the most
\"realistic\" option for both sides]{.underline}. At this juncture,
worthy of note is an interesting comment made by Charlie Neuhauser, a
leading CIA China specialist, on the Vietnam War, a war fought by the
United States to contain the then-Communist \"other.\" Neuhauser says,
\"Nobody wants it. We don\'t want it, Ho Chi Minh doesn\'t want it;
it\'s simply a question of annoying the other side.\"94 And, as we know,
in an unwanted war some fifty-eight thousand young people from the
United States and an estimated two million Vietnamese men, women, and
children lost their lives. Therefore, to call for a halt to the vicious
circle of theory as practice associated with the \"China threat\"
literature[, tinkering with the current positivist-dominated U.S. IR
scholarship on China is no longer adequate.]{.underline} Rather[, what
is needed is to question this un-self-reflective scholarship itself,
particularly its connections with the dominant way in which the United
States and the West in general represent themselves and others via their
positivist epistemology,]{.underline} so that alternative, more nuanced,
[and less dangerous ways of interpreting and debating China might become
possible]{.underline}.

#### Understanding China as a social structure is necessary to understand its role in IR (alt k2 solve relations / china heg position can't be determined without the alt?)

**Fumagelli, 2018**

Relations, University of St Andrews. He has a PhD in Politics from the

Although it is sometimes heavy on theory, particularly in the first
section(Chapters 1--5) which could have been condensed, [this
volume]{.underline} sheds light on international roles as social
structures emerging from processes of self-identification, contestation
of domestic roles, and international interaction (Har-nisch, 2016, p.
3). The volume locates itself in the broad field of foreign policy
analysis, in which it [identifies a gap in the study of international
roles and iden-tities on a conceptual level,]{.underline} and another,
empirically, in the prevailing focus on "external expectations in the
processes of socialization, mimicking, or imi-tation" (Harnisch, 2016,
p. 3), meaning that "the literature \[\...\] lacks a set of mechanisms
to explain China's differentiated integration into the international
order" (Harnisch, 2016, p. 4). Contra those claims, [Harnisch argues
that a full understanding of China's place in the international system
and its positioning in the international social order requires taking
international roles as "social structures" seriously. To do so means
incorporating processes of self-identification, domestic contestation,
and alter-casting into the analysis as these are central to both the
current internal debate on China's role]{.underline} (Harnisch, 2016,p.
3). The volume's contributors ultimately posit that role theory should
take self-identification, domestic contestation, and other modes of
interaction much more seriously as causal mechanisms for self-binding
behavior by role-holders. No less valuable is the fact that unlike many
edited books, [this volume is a cohesive and coherent collective effort
structured around a common theoretical framework and a common set of
guiding questions]{.underline} which is no small achieve-ment for an
edited work.

#### China threat socially constructed 

**Katagiri 19**

"The Chinese Journal of International Politics", Volume 12, Issue 1,
<https://doi.org/10.1093/cjip/poy018>, AD)

Finally, [constructivists would associate the rebalance as a social
construct of emerging actors in the Asia-Pacific region in fostering
regional identity, cultures of cooperation, and a security
community.]{.underline}20 [Constructivists see the rebalance as having
the notional effect of encouraging nations to comply with the norm of
collaboration to deal with common threats]{.underline} such as piracy
and the climate change. At the same time, other [constructivists might
take issue with the rebalance by arguing that, owing to the hard
military image the rebalance projected, the USA should try to tone down
the impression and rhetoric whereby military power is perceived as
central. For them, the rebalance is not necessarily the best move to
address a threat that does not exist, and there is no need to make one
up. What people may see as China's threat is what the USA makes of it,
and the rebalance may, thus, contribute to a hostile
environment]{.underline} where there is no need for such a strategy in
the first place. Instead, constructivists would propose greater cultural
exchanges with Asian countries and promote cooperation-based on shared
values such as human rights protection and rule of law.

Computing and Communication, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK;
Securitization and the global politics of cybersecurity; 2018)

Hansen and Nissenbaum reach a conclusion that resonates with the broader
objectives of securitization theory and 'critical security studies': to
develop strategies to counter and interrogate the 'exceptional' status
of security issues -- where an issue might be presented as 'exceptional'
due to the threat to the national interest and/or exceptional due to the
technical knowledge needed to evaluate the threat: [Cyber
securitizations are particularly powerful precisely because they involve
a double move out of the political realm: from the politicized to the
securitized, from the political to the techniﬁed, and it takes an
inter-disciplinary eﬀort to assess the implications of the move, and
possibly to counter it \... cyber security stands at the intersection of
multiple disciplines and it is important that both analysis and academic
communication is brought to bear on it]{.underline}. The technical
underpinnings of cyber security require, for instance, that IR scholars
acquire some familiarity with the main technical methods and dilemmas,
and vice versa that computer scientists become more cognizant of the
politicized ﬁeld in which they design and how their decisions might
impact the (discursively constituted) trade-oﬀs between security,
access, trust, and privacy. (Ibid, 1172) The implication of this
argument is an important one: [we should develop the tools that enable
us to challenge the ethico-political dangers of hypersecuritization in
this rapidly changing (cyber) space]{.underline}; to be able to see into
this zone of expert knowledge and authority, the spaces where decisions
are made on the policies and technologies that will shape all areas of
war and security (see Balzacq 2011). But this article asks: What should
IR scholars be doing in addition to the challenge and task -- to become
more interdisciplinary in order to be able to engage with the potential
techniﬁcation and hypersecuritizations of cybersecurity policy and
discourse -- that was set out in Hansen and Nissenbaum's article?

We can agree that [I]{.underline}nternational [R]{.underline}elations
[is]{.underline} inherently [the discipline that has the responsibility
for considering global processes]{.underline}, and that
[this]{.underline} [is a responsibility it has]{.underline} thus far
[failed to shoulder]{.underline}. Yet this 'Manifesto' seems underpinned
by an expectation that International Relations while currently failing
the planet, may be of some use in 'saving' it. This is indeed dreaming.
**[Whatever might be 'saved', the discipline of IR will have little if
anything to do with it]{.underline}**. [The discipline's emergence as
the handmaiden of political theory]{.underline} (with all the modernist
binaries, including those of inside/outside, subject/object, cause and
effect) [makes IR particularly unsuited for dealing with the
entanglements of the Anthropocene/Capitalocene]{.underline}. Where the
globalisation of the 1990s undermined political theory's
state-centredness, the Anthropocene/Capitalocene of the 2010s similarly
rings the death-knell for Burke et al.'s human-centred global
liberalism. What we do not need at the present time is a 'planet
politics' based on diktat and wedded to a Liberal account of
International Relations. Rather, **[we need a concerted assault on the
systemic practices, institutions and imperatives of dominatory power
which have contributed to a condition of crisis]{.underline}**. What we
also require is the exploration of ideas from outside the disciplinary
prison. These may help us in the task of building networks of
reciprocity across social, cultural and species distinctions -- of
kin-making, of making space for the possibility of life in capitalist
ruins.84 If we are prisoners, it is because we choose to be, and that
appears to be the choice that Burke et al. have made. Thus we advocate a
Non-Manifesto for the Capitalocene. Even a Non-Manifesto might make use
of a rallying cry, and Springer's railing against Neoliberalism fits our
purposes well. So, fuck the Capitalocene and Fuck the hold it has on our
political imaginations. Fuck the violence it engenders. Fuck the
inequality it extols as a virtue. Fuck the way it has ravaged the
environment. Fuck the endless cycle of accumulation and the cult of
growth.85 Let us find new ways of making life with others in the
oncoming ruins of the Capitalocene; of making flourishing life for
myriad creatures including those wonderful primates called human. This,
certainly, will be beyond International Relations (as We Knew It). Let's
get out of jail.

### 2nc - Alt solvency 

#### Only the alt solves endless war-making 

**Wilhemsen 16** (Julie Wilhelmsen, Norwegian Institute of International
Affairs; How does war become a legitimate undertaking? Re-engaging the
post-structuralist foundation of securitization theory; 5-17-16)

The general thrust of the argument underlying this description of [the
securitization process]{.underline} is in many respects in line with
post-structuralist ideas of how policies [are coconstituted by
identities and rely on accounts that make sense of them and legitimize
them as they are launched]{.underline} (Campbell, 1992; Hansen, 2006).
The post-structuralist stance is that policies are not a given response
to an external reality to which the state (or other social actors)
relates objectively, but are co-constituted by ideas or identities.
**[References to identities are necessary to represent and legitimize
policies]{.underline}**, [but at the same time these identities are
constituted and reproduced through the formulation of
policies]{.underline}. This is why the term 'co-constituted' is used.
When the production of politics is understood in this way the task for
the analyst is to 'embrace a logic of interpretation that acknowledges
the improbability of cataloguing, calculating and specifying "real
causes" and concerns itself with considering the manifest political
consequences of adopting one mode of representation over another'
(Campbell, 1992: 4). Studying politics then involves studying how some
[representations of reality become dominant discourses]{.underline}, and
how problems, [subjects and objects are constituted in these discourses
that simultaneously indicate relevant policies to pursue]{.underline}.
The claim is not that [such dominant representations]{.underline} cause
certain policies or actions, but that they [both open up and constrain
the range of policies and actions that seem possible and legitimate to
undertake]{.underline} (Hansen, 2006). This link between identity and
policies can be conceptualized more explicitly as one of legitimation.
Jackson (2006: 16) sees legitimation as: the process of drawing and
(re)establishing boundaries, ruling some courses of action acceptable
and others unacceptable. Out of the general morass of public political
debate, legitimation contingently stabilizes the boundaries of
acceptable action, making it possible for certain policies to be
enacted. '**[The process of drawing and (re)establishing boundaries' is
here taken to be the continuous references to Self and Other that policy
formulation implies and which]{.underline}**, in turn, **[legitimates
policy implementation]{.underline}**. Based on this understanding of how
policies are produced and legitimized, [a poststructuralist approach
would imply treating securitization as a process through which a
representation of something as an existential threat becomes dominant at
the expense of other representations and uncovering]{.underline}, in the
course of research, [the changing boundary between this identity and
that given to the 'referent object']{.underline}. These changing
representations would not determine emergency action, but would
condition the range of emergency measures political actors could
undertake legitimately. In turn, the undertaking of such emergency
measures against the something that is said to be threatening and in
defence of the referent object would confirm and reinforce the new
identity boundaries that were drawn up and legitimize the undertaking of
emergency measures. From a poststructuralist perspective the process of
securitization is a fundamentally co-constitutive process and one that
implies legitimizing concrete material security practices (see below).
This reading suggests that securitization cannot be treated as a
sequential, linear process from securitizing actor through audience
acceptance and to emergency measures. Rather, it is a much more dynamic
development; securitizing actors, referent object, threat objects as
well as exceptional measures are co-constituted within the securitizing
process.4 Moreover, [alternative articulations of the Self/Other
boundary which attach a lower level of threat to the Other can emerge
and render emergency measures illegitimate]{.underline}. **[This would
be a process of de-securitization.]{.underline}**
