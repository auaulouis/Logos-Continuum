**Amnesty International 2014** (Amnesty International, "CHINA'S TRADE IN
TOOLS OF TORTURE AND REPRESSION",
[https://www.amnestyusa.org/reports/chinas-trade-in-tools-of-torture-and-repression](https://www.amnestyusa.org/reports/chinas-trade-in-tools-of-torture-and-repression/),

In recent years [China has consolidated its position as a major
manufacturer and exporter]{.underline} not only [of]{.underline}
firearms and related ammunition but also of a growing range of other
[equipment used in law enforcement]{.underline} -- from handcuffs to
electric shock stun batons to riot control gear. Chinese companies have
been actively promoting their equipment globally, increasing their
presence at trade fairs across the world. There are now more than 130
Chinese companies involved in the development, manufacture and trade in
these potentially dangerous products, a sharp rise from a decade ago,
but the size and scope of this industry in China has barely been
researched until now. This report documents [China\'s manufacture of and
trade in law enforcement equipment]{.underline} other than firearms and
related ammunition, and considers some examples of how this equipment is
used in China and abroad. The rise in Chinese manufacture and export of
equipment for use in law enforcement [has not been accompanied by
adequate domestic regulations or export controls]{.underline}. Some
equipment manufactured and openly marketed by Chinese companies -- such
as electric shock stun batons [and]{.underline} weighted leg cuffs --
[is intrinsically cruel, inhuman and degrading]{.underline}
**[and]{.underline}** therefore **[should be prohibited]{.underline}**.
The promotion, trade and export of inherently abusive equipment is
already prohibited in the EU -- a position reinforced by the 2013 UN
General Assembly resolution on torture. Other equipment -- for instance
ordinary handcuffs or certain types of crowd control equipment -- can
have a legitimate role in law enforcement, but its trade and use need to
be strictly controlled in line with international standards for law
enforcement to remove any substantial risk of the equipment being used
for violations of human rights. **[China does not have adequate controls
in place and has exported law enforcement equipment to countries where
there is a clear risk that the equipment will be misused.]{.underline}**
Chapter 1 presents an overview of China\'s law enforcement equipment
manufacturing sector. It looks in detail at four categories of equipment
manufactured in China: restraints, electric shock devices, striking
weapons and crowd control gear, assessing in each category whether the
equipment has a legitimate use and, if so, the necessary controls that
should apply to prevent misuse, or whether the use of the device should
be prohibited outright or suspended pending further research by
independent experts. Chapter 2 looks at how [this equipment has been
used by law enforcement officials in China to violate human
rights]{.underline}. It describes cases in which law enforcement
personnel have used electric shock equipment and restraints to torture
detainees held in China\'s notoriously harsh detention facilities. It
also looks at the misuse of riot gear in the policing of public
assemblies, including against Tibetan and Uighur protesters. Chapter 3
pieces together China\'s opaque international trade in an array of law
enforcement equipment using data gathered at trade fairs, company
literature, photographic evidence and specific cases of irresponsible
transfers. It analyses China\'s export controls, and concludes that they
suffer from inadequate export assessment criteria, weak oversight, lack
of transparency and reluctance to enforce existing regulations. As a
result, Chinese equipment marketed to law enforcement agencies in other
countries risks facilitating serious human rights violations. Chapter 4
analyses the responsibility of states and companies focusing
particularly on responsibilities in relation to the export of law
enforcement equipment. States have a legal obligation to co-operate in
the realization of human rights within and beyond their borders. The
chapter argues that [this principle]{.underline}, [already explicitly
recognized in relation to a wide range of conventional weapons through
the Arms Trade Treaty]{.underline} and other international legal
agreements[, applies to the use and export of law enforcement
equipment]{.underline}. It also looks at the corporate responsibility to
respect human rights and the risk of corporate complicity in human
rights violations where companies have failed to act with due diligence
to prevent equipment they manufacture or sell being misused. For many
years Amnesty International and the Omega Research Foundation (Omega)
have advocated [that states should adopt legally enforceable regulations
at the national and international levels to strictly control the
production, promotion, trade, transfer and use of policing and other law
enforcement equipment]{.underline}. In 2005 Amnesty International
[and]{.underline} Omega were instrumental in the EU\'s adoption of
regulations that [ban the production and export of specific \"tools of
torture\" and strictly control trade in other equipment which, while
intended for law enforcement, can easily be misused for torture or other
ill-treatment]{.underline}. Amnesty International and Omega continue to
campaign for these regulations to be strengthened in the EU and adopted
globally. Amnesty International and Omega are [calling on the Chinese
authorities to bring China\'s national regulation of law enforcement
equipment into line with this emerging international framework. The
Chinese authorities should prohibit the production, use and export of
\"tools of torture\". China must also reform its export licencing system
for law enforcement equipment, making the system transparent and
publicly accountable. Strict, human rights-based criteria must be
applied and met before export licences are issued]{.underline}. More
broadly, there must be a greater understanding of the potential problems
associated with law enforcement equipment, and the rationale behind the
regulation of its design, transfer and use. **[Concrete steps need to be
taken by all states, not only China, to combat the misuse of legitimate
law enforcement equipment by law enforcement agencies around the
world.]{.underline}**

\*card goes relatively in depth on the mechanisms of torture --
**TRIGGER WARNING**\*

Chinese security agents continue to employ a medieval array of torture
methods against government opponents, activists, lawyers and
petitioners, including spiked rods, iron torture chairs and electric
batons, a report claims. [The Amnesty International report, called No
End in Sight: Torture and Forced Confessions in China, is based on
interviews with nearly 40 Chinese human rights lawyers and contains
chilling details of alleged beatings and torture sessions endured by
those taken into police custody]{.underline}. Patrick Poon, the report's
author, said that despite government pledges to reform, Amnesty had
documented recent cases of torture in virtually every corner of the
country. "From Beijing to Hunan to Heilongjiang to Guangdong -- [there
are cases of torture in many]{.underline}, many [places]{.underline}.
The problem is still very widespread in different provinces. It isn't
just concentrated [in]{.underline} a certain area of
[China]{.underline}," he said. Poon said most of those targeted were
human rights lawyers, Communist party officials taken into custody by
anti-corruption investigators, and practitioners of the banned spiritual
movement Falun Gong. One of the most shocking cases described in the
report was that of Cai Ying, a 52-year-old human rights lawyer from
Hunan province. Cai claimed that after being detained in 2012 he was
forced to sit on a "hanging restraint chair" -- a contraption that
immobilises a prisoner by dangling them in the air with their hands and
chest strapped to a board. In a recent interview with Hong Kong's South
China Morning Post, Cai recalled excruciating torture sessions. "I was
humiliated so badly I thought of ending it all, but then I thought of my
daughter," he said. "The humiliating experience filled my heart with
hatred." Yu Wensheng, another lawyer, said that after being detained
last October for protesting outside a detention centre where a client
was being held, he spent more than three months in custody suffering
torture. Yu claimed he was held with death row inmates for 61 days,
during which he was questioned about 200 times. At one point officers
handcuffed him to an iron chair with his hands behind his back. "My
hands were swollen and I felt so much pain that I didn't want to live,"
he was quoted as saying. "The two police officers repeatedly yanked the
handcuffs. I screamed every time they pulled them." Speaking to the
Guardian earlier this year, Yu described the despair of his time behind
bars. "I felt helpless and lonely," he said. "**[It is both physical and
psychological suffering]{.underline}**. I don't think I could bear going
back to jail for a long stretch again. If I get sent back to jail again,
I will go on hunger strike -- I would rather die than face a long spell
in jail." Poon said the Chinese government had taken some steps over the
past five years to tackle the problem of torture. [In 2012 Beijing vowed
to "enforce preventive]{.underline} and remedial [measures]{.underline}
to prevent extortion [of]{.underline} confession by
[torture]{.underline} and collecting evidence through illegal methods".
Xinhua, China's official news agency, has reported on plans to introduce
real-time monitoring and control management of interrogation sessions
using audio and video equipment. [However]{.underline}, Amnesty [said
such reforms had "in reality done little to change the deep-rooted
practice of torturing suspects to extract forced
confessions"]{.underline}. Chinese law outlawed only certain acts of
torture and did not cover acts of mental torture, the group said.
Lawyers trying to investigate or seek redress for such cases were
"systematically thwarted by police, prosecutors and the courts". Human
rights activists believe the situation has deteriorated since President
Xi Jinping took control of the Communist party three years ago. Xi, who
some describe as China's most authoritarian ruler since Mao, has tasked
the country's security apparatus with dismantling any potential source
of opposition to the party. A renewed crackdown on human rights lawyers
has been under way since July, and at least 12 people -- including the
prominent rights lawyers Wang Yu, Li Heping and Zhang Kai -- are still
being held in undisclosed locations on state security charges. Activists
fear those prisoners are likely to be suffering psychological and
possibly physical torture. "The government's attitude to lawyers has
become even more hostile than before under \[former president\] Hu
Jintao," said Poon. "[If they continue to crack down on lawyers and to
allow this kind of torture to happen, it won't help maintain social
stability but will only create even more social unrest]{.underline}. If
lawyers face such treatment, imagine ordinary people."

### 2NC -- Turns Case

#### Chinese expansionism creates an exception for rights violations

**Roth 17** (Kenneth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, which
operates in more than 90 countries, previously served as a federal
prosecutor in New York and for the Iran-Contra investigation, graduated
Yale Law School and Brown University, Roth has conducted numerous human
rights investigations and missions around the world. He has written
extensively on a wide range of human rights abuses, devoting special
attention to issues of international justice, counterterrorism, the
foreign policies of the major powers, and the work of the United
Nations, "China, Events of 2017",
<https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2018/country-chapters/china-and-tibet>,
7/15)mw

[The broad and sustained offensive on human rights that started after
President Xi Jinping took power five years ago showed no sign of abating
in 2017]{.underline}. The death of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo
in a hospital under heavy guard in July highlighted the Chinese
government's deepening contempt for rights. [The near future for human
rights appears grim]{.underline}, especially [as Xi is expected to
remain in power at least until 2022]{.underline}. [Foreign governments
did little in 2017 to push back against China's worsening rights record
at home and abroad]{.underline}. The Chinese government, which already
oversees one of the strictest online censorship regimes in the world,
limited the provision of censorship circumvention tools and strengthened
ideological control over education and mass media in 2017. Schools and
state media incessantly tout the supremacy of the Chinese Communist
Party, and, increasingly, of President Xi Jinping as "core" leader.
[Authorities subjected more human rights
defenders]{.underline}---including foreigners---to show trials in 2017,
airing excerpted forced confessions and court trials on state television
and social media. Police ensured the detainees' compliance [by torturing
some of them, denying them access to lawyers of their choice, and
holding them incommunicado for months]{.underline}. In Xinjiang, a
nominally autonomous region with 11 million Turkic Muslim Uyghurs,
authorities stepped up mass surveillance and the security presence
despite the lack of evidence demonstrating an organized threat. [They
also adopted new policies denying Uyghurs cultural and religious
rights]{.underline}. Hong Kong's human rights record took a dark turn.
Hong Kong courts disqualified four pro-democracy lawmakers in July and
jailed three prominent pro-democracy student leaders in August.
**[China's growing global influence means many of its rights violations
now have international implications]{.underline}**. In April, security
officials at the United Nations headquarters in New York City ejected
from the premises Dolkun Isa, an ethnic Uyghur rights activist, who was
accredited as a nongovernmental organization (NGO) participant to a
forum there; no explanation was provided. [In June, the European Union
failed]{.underline} for the first time ever [to deliver a statement
under a standing agenda item at the UN Human Rights Council]{.underline}
(UNHRC[) regarding country situations requiring the council's
attention]{.underline}. [This stemmed from Greece blocking the necessary
EU consensus for such an intervention due to its unwillingness to
criticize human rights violations in China]{.underline}, with which it
has substantial trade ties. [Chinese officials continued throughout the
year to pressure governments around the world to forcibly return
allegedly corrupt mainland officials]{.underline} despite a lack of
legal protections in China or refugee status determination procedures
outside China. Despite the high costs, many in China continued to fight
for rights and justice in 2017. Activists, including those working on
women's, disability, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)
rights, continued to take cases to court to seek limited redress and
raise awareness. In a small but significant step, in July a court in
Henan province ruled against a public hospital for forcing a gay man to
undergo discriminatory "conversion therapy." In its narrow ruling, the
court found that admitting the plaintiff to the hospital against his
will violated his rights. Human Rights Defenders The death of Nobel
Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo in 2017 laid bare authorities'
ruthlessness towards peaceful proponents of human rights and democracy.
In July, after serving nearly nine years of his 11-year prison sentence
for "inciting subversion," Liu Xiaobo died from cancer in a Shenyang
hospital, heavily guarded by state security. During his hospitalization,
authorities isolated Liu and his wife, Liu Xia, from family and
supporters, and denied Liu's request to seek treatment outside the
country. Since Liu's death, authorities have forcibly disappeared Liu
Xia. The government also harassed and detained a group of Liu's
supporters for commemorating his death. In 2017, [authorities
continued]{.underline} politically motivated [prosecutions of human
rights activists and lawyers]{.underline} who were rounded up in a
nationwide crackdown that began in July 2015. Lawyer Wang Quanzhang and
activist Wu Gan remained in police custody, awaiting trial or verdict on
baseless charges. In November, lawyer Jiang Tianyong was sentenced to
two years in prison on charges of "inciting subversion of state power."
LIU XIAExpand Outside a Beijing courthouse, April 23, 2013: "I am not
free. If they tell you I'm free, tell them I'm not free."\... A number
of those caught in the "709 crackdown" were freed, but they continue to
be closely monitored and isolated from friends and colleagues; **[some
revealed that they were tortured and forced to confess while in
detention]{.underline}**. [Authorities also continued to harass and
intimidate the lawyers who represent the detainees, ordering them not to
speak to media and disbarring several after giving them failing marks in
China's annual lawyers' evaluation]{.underline}. In March, a court in
Guangdong province, in separate trials, convicted women's rights
activist Su Changlan and online political commentator Chen Qitang on
baseless charges of "inciting subversion" and sentenced them to prison
terms of three years and four-and-a-half years, respectively. Su was
released in October after serving her sentence. Her [health deteriorated
sharply while in detention due to inadequate medical care and poor
conditions in detention]{.underline}. In March, a Sichuan court
sentenced artist Chen Yunfei to four years in prison on charges of
"picking quarrels and provoking trouble" in connection with his
activities commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Massacre. [The government
also tried to eliminate the country's few independent human rights news
websites by jailing their founders]{.underline}. In August, a Yunnan
court sentenced citizen journalist and protest chronicler Lu Yuyu to
four years in prison on charges of "picking quarrels and provoking
trouble." Also in August, authorities charged Liu Feiyue, founder of the
website Civil Rights and Livelihood Watch (民生观察) with "leaking state
secrets" and "inciting subversion of state power." Liu [could face life
imprisonment if convicted]{.underline}. Veteran [activist]{.underline}
and founder of the human rights website 64 Tianwang, Huang Qi, [suffers
from kidney disease and has been denied adequate medical care since his
detention]{.underline} in November 2016. In August, prominent rights
lawyer and activist Gao Zhisheng disappeared from his home in Shaanxi
province. Authorities subsequently informed Gao's family that he had
been taken into police custody. [China continues to detain non-citizens
for promoting human rights in China]{.underline}. In March, Guangdong
authorities arbitrarily detained Taiwan democracy activist Lee Ming-che.
After holding him incommunicado for six months, denying him access to
family, a court in Hunan province sentenced Lee to five years in prison
for "subverting state power." Mainland activist Peng Yuhua, who was
tried alongside Lee, was given a seven-year sentence on the same charge.

invented in fascist Italy in 1937 by psychiatrist Ugo Cerletti. Darius
Rejali, author of Torture and Modernity, wrote of Cerletti \"having
killed a few dogs by experimentation\" and then \"discovered that Roman
slaughterhouses used electrocution to slaughter pigs.\" Cerletti
\"discovered that pigs could be shocked several times and would revive
after a few minutes.\" He then applied ECT to humans, his first victim
screaming that it was \"deadly.\" \"The torture and \'treatments\' of
the insane\" historically has derived from the \"application to animals
in abattoirs,\" Rejali stated.\[9\] Cerletti\'s device very rapidly
pressed into political service, Rejali said. In August 2017, a paper
published in History of Psychiatry documented how \"The Nazi political
and medical establishment\" regarded ECT as a means \"to empty
psychiatric institutions, thereby relieving the state of the burden...\"
Psychiatrist Emil Gelny \"added four extra electrodes to existing ECT
machines, which were attached to patients\' wrists and ankles to deliver
the lethal shocks after patients were knocked unconscious by the initial
current applied to the head.\"\[10\] In the 1950s, the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) expressed considerable interest in ECT
devices. In 1951, Project Artichoke, then MK-ULTRA under Deputy CIA
Director Richard Helms in 1953, aimed to control human behavior through
hallucinogenic drugs and electroshock.\[11\] Dr. Ewen Cameron, the first
president of the World Psychiatric Association, while professor of
psychiatry at McGill University in Canada in the 1950s and 60s,
developed his own version of shock treatment, using the UK Page-Russell
electroshock device invented in 1948. Cameron called his shock technique
\"de-patterning\" deliberately wiping out patient memories by the use of
intensive ECT. The CIA funded his work.\[12\] He described the procedure
on a patient to the 2nd World Congress of Psychiatry in 1957, stating:
\"There is complete amnesia for all events of his life.\"\[13\]
Electroshock \'took away her soul\' In 2017, 60 years after Cameron\'s
experiments left her mother damaged for life, Alison Steel obtained a
\$100,000 settlement from the Canadian government over Cameron\'s
experiments. \"She was never able to really function as a healthy human
being because of what they did to her,\" Steel stated. \"Her emotions
were stripped. It took away her soul.\"\[14\] **[Electroshock is also
used for torture, including on prisoners]{.underline}** of the French
during the 1954-62 Algerian War.\[15\] Journalist Gordon Thomas reported
that in 1961, Moroccan king Hassan II\'s security service was fully
staffed with doctors who supervised a wide range of tortures of
political detainees using several Page-Russell electroshock
machines.\[16\] Chinese dissidents and members of the religious group
The Falun Gong are still subjected to electroshock and \"other barbaric
forms of torture designed by prison guards to humiliate and inflict
maximum pain.\"\[17\] Until 1973, when the APA de-classified
homosexuality as a mental disorder, electroshock treatment was used in
an effort to prevent or eliminate homosexual behavior.\[18\] **[Other
forms of shock included jolts of electricity administered to the skin
and body,]{.underline}** sometimes directly to the genitals.\[19\]
**[Voltage of such devices ranged anywhere from 150-200 volts and on
children for behavioral control]{.underline}**, 300-400 volts.\[20\]
Allegations that psychiatrists and any others recommending ECT to treat
the LGBT community today are homophobic and cruel, CCHR says.\[21\]
Brain Damage and Memory Loss Yet the FDA and APA continue to ignore the
perils of ECT. **[In March 2016, a coroner from Sunderland County in the
UK determined Elsie Tindle died after electroshock triggered an
epileptic fit which caused irreparable brain
damage]{.underline}**.\[22\] **[A 2012 study published in Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences reported a considerable \"decrease in
functional connectivity\" between the prefrontal lobes of the brain and
other parts of the brain after ECT.]{.underline}** The most extensive
long-term follow-up study indicates that \"most ECT patients will never
recover from the damage in the form of persistent severe mental
deficits.\"\[23\] Austin, Texas, psychologist John Breeding, who heads
the Coalition for the Abolition of Electroshock, said, **[\"The bottom
line is that ECT \'works\' to the extent that it damages and disables
the brain]{.underline}**.\"\[24\] Breeding dispels psychiatric theories
that the procedure is safer today than its \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s
Nest\" days in the 60s. **[He says that ECT has more potential for harm
than ever. Much higher voltages are employed in the modern
procedure]{.underline}** because muscle relaxants and anesthetics raise
the seizure threshold, with more electricity required to produce a
seizure. **[The greater heat and electricity themselves cause more brain
cell death]{.underline}**, he says. He concludes \"Given what we know
about the resulting brain damage, I think this is a form of
assault...\"\[25\]

#### There are only two US manufacturers of shock therapy devices

**\-\--Wikipedia "Electroconvulsive Therapy"**

Devices Most modern ECT devices deliver a brief-pulse current, which is
thought to cause fewer cognitive effects than the sine-wave currents
which were originally used in
ECT.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy#cite_note-Rudorfer-1)
A small minority of psychiatrists in the US still use sine-wave
stimuli.[\[59\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy#cite_note-Prudic_01-59)
Sine-wave is no longer used in the UK or
Ireland.[\[61\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy#cite_note-Duffett-61)
Typically, the electrical stimulus used in ECT is about 800
[milliamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amperes) and has up to several
hundred [watts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt), and the current
flows for between one and 6
seconds.**[\[62\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy#cite_note-Lock-62)
[In the US, ECT devices are manufactured by two companies, Somatics,
which is owned by psychiatrists Richard Abrams and Conrad Swartz, and
[Mecta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecta)]{.underline}**.[\[69\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy#cite_note-69)
In the UK, the market for ECT devices was long monopolized by Ectron
Ltd, which was set up by psychiatrist Robert
Russell.[\[70\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy#cite_note-70)

What is Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)? [Electroconvulsive therapy
(ECT) is a medical treatment most commonly used in patients with severe
**major depression or bipolar disorder** **that has not responded to
other treatments.** ECT involves a brief **electrical stimulation of the
brain** **while the patient is under anesthesia**. It is typically
administered by a team of trained medical professionals that includes a
psychiatrist, an anesthesiologist, and a nurse or physician
assistant.]{.underline} [Does ECT work?](javascript:void(0))
**[Extensive research has found ECT to be highly effective for the
relief of major depression. Clinical evidence indicates that for
individuals with uncomplicated, but severe major depression, ECT will
produce substantial improvement in approximately 80 percent of patients.
It is also used for other severe mental illnesses, such as bipolar
disorder and schizophrenia.]{.underline}** ECT is sometimes used in
treating individuals with catatonia, a condition in which a person can
become increasingly agitated and unresponsive. A person with catatonia
can seriously injure themselves or develop severe dehydration from not
eating or drinking. [ECT is typically used when other treatments,
including medications and psychotherapy, haven't worked**. ECT is also
used for people who require a rapid treatment response because of the
severity of their condition, such as being at risk for suicide.** ECT's
effectiveness in treating severe mental illnesses is recognized by the
American Psychiatric Association, the American Medical Association, the
National Institute of Mental Health, and similar organizations in
Canada, Great Britain and many other countries.]{.underline} Although
ECT can be very effective for many individuals with serious mental
illness, it is not a cure. To prevent a return of the illness, most
people treated with ECT need to continue with some type of maintenance
treatment. This typically means psychotherapy and/or medication or, in
some circumstances, ongoing ECT treatments.

United States]{.underline}"*, JAMA Therapy,
<https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2680312>)//ICW-Gsharda

Discussion We used a decision analytic model to evaluate the clinical
and economic effects of varying strategies for using ECT to treat
treatment-resistant depression in the United States. [We found that ECT
would **substantially improve clinical outcomes**, reducing time with
uncontrolled depression from 50.2% to 32.9% to 37.1% of life-years over
a 4-year horizon]{.underline}. We projected a 74% to 78% likelihood that
ECT would be cost-effective in the United States given commonly accepted
cost-effectiveness thresholds (ICER ≤\$100 000 per
QALY).[29](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2680312#yoi180026r29)
Across a range of realistic variations in model input data, [we found
that offering ECT after failure of 2 lines of
pharmacotherapy/psychotherapy would **most reliably** maximize its
health-economic value.]{.underline} For patients with 3 or more prior
treatment trials, offering ECT later in the course of treatment would
still be cost-effective. When compared with other depression
interventions that have been evaluated, [the cost-effectiveness of ECT
for treatment-resistant depression is **superior** to pharmacogenetic
testing and similar to a rural collaborative care intervention. Based on
these findings, we **recommend** **that clinicians consider offering ECT
to patients with major depressive disorder** who have failed to respond
to 2 trials of pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy.]{.underline}
[Notably, our findings **align well** with 2017 recommendations from
**Conway et al**, who propose defining treatment-resistant depression by
"failure of 2 adequate dose-duration antidepressants or psychotherapy
from different
classes"[21](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2680312#yoi180026r21)
and **recommend considering ECT** at this point. Similarly, the **2017
Florida best practice guidelines** for treatment of major depressive
disorder **include ECT as a level 3 treatment**, to be considered after
failure of levels 1 and
2.[68](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2680312#yoi180026r68)]{.underline}
Despite these recommendations, we recognize that many clinicians will
regard offering ECT as third-line treatment to be overly aggressive,
especially given the common view of ECT as a last-resort treatment for
depression.[15](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2680312#yoi180026r15),[69](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2680312#yoi180026r69)
To understand how third-line ECT can be reasonable and cost-effective,
it is crucial to recognize how challenging treatment-resistant
depression is to manage. [Observational and trial data indicate that
fewer than one-third of patients with this condition respond to
pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy, and those who do respond are at
high risk of
relapse]{.underline}.[4](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2680312#yoi180026r4),[70](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2680312#yoi180026r70)
[Given the **limited effectiveness of commonly used treatments,** it may
be less surprising that earlier **ECT use would greatly improve clinical
outcomes** for patients with treatment-resistant
depression.]{.underline} Limitations Our analysis has limitations
related to the model's structure, the input data used, and the scope of
the analysis. By necessity, a model must include some simplifying
assumptions. Where possible, we have chosen these assumptions to be
conservative with respect to ECT's cost-effectiveness, such as assuming
indefinite maintenance ECT use, excluding ECT's effects on mortality and
speed of
remission,[3](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2680312#yoi180026r3),[7](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2680312#yoi180026r7)
and excluding the possibility of greater efficacy with earlier ECT
use.[10](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2680312#yoi180026r10)
In addition, our model assumes that transition probabilities between
states (eg, relapse
probabilities[71](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2680312#yoi180026r71))
do not vary over time. Despite these simplifications, the model's
outcomes are well validated by independent data on costs, long-term
clinical outcomes, and quality of life. Next, there are several
shortcomings in our model's input data. Much of our cost data are more
than a decade old and reflect primarily privately insured
patients,[43](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2680312#yoi180026r43)-[45](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2680312#yoi180026r43)
and there is uncertainty regarding the cost of
ECT.[16](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2680312#yoi180026r16),[17](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2680312#yoi180026r17),[45](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2680312#yoi180026r45)
In addition, many of our estimates of relapse rates with pharmacotherapy
or maintenance ECT reflect sample sizes of 100 patients or
fewer.[4](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2680312#yoi180026r4),[22](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2680312#yoi180026r22),[39](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2680312#yoi180026r39),[40](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2680312#yoi180026r40)Finally,
our reliance on clinical trial data may limit the generalizability and
external validity of our
results.[4](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2680312#yoi180026r4)
However, our main findings are robust to sensitivity analysis using
alternative data sources or appropriately broad confidence intervals.
Finally, the scope of our analysis introduces several limitations. Our
choice of a health care sector perspective is intended to be relevant to
patients, clinicians, and payers; however, this perspective excludes
indirect costs and benefits such as patient transportation and
productivity gains after depression
treatment.[17](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2680312#yoi180026r17),[72](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2680312#yoi180026r72)
Additionally, we did not evaluate other novel interventions for
treatment-resistant depression, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic
stimulation or
ketamine.[13](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2680312#yoi180026r13),[46](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2680312#yoi180026r46)
Conclusions [In this mathematical modeling analysis, we found that ECT
is a cost-effective treatment option for treatment-resistant depression
in the **United** States. Offering ECT after 2 failed lines of
pharmacotherapy/psychotherapy is most likely to maximize its
health-economic value and is concordant with recommendations from some
national guidelines and ECT specialists.]{.underline} **[Increasing use
of ECT by offering it earlier in the course of treatment-resistant
depression could greatly improve outcomes for this difficult-to-treat
patient population.]{.underline}**

#### Hundreds of millions of people worldwide suffer from mental health disorders that could be treated by ECT

[**Ritchie & Roser 18** -- Hannah Ritchie, PhD in GeoSciences at the
University of Edinburgh & Max

In this entry we present the latest estimates of mental health disorder
prevalence, disease burden rates, and mortality impacts across a number
of disorders. We address substance use disorders (alcohol and drug use
disorders) in separate entries on [Substance
Use](https://ourworldindata.org/substance-use) and [Alcohol
Consumption](https://ourworldindata.org/alcohol-consumption). **[Most of
the estimates presented in this entry are produced by the Institute for
Health Metrics and Evaluation and reported in their flagship Global
Burden of Disease study. Mental health and substance use disorders are
still significantly under-reported]{.underline}**. This is true across
all countries, but particularly at lower incomes where data is scarcer,
and there is less attention and treatment for mental health disorders.
Mental health disorders are complex and can take many forms. The
underlying sources of the data presented in this entry apply specific
definitions (which we describe in each relevant section), typically in
accordance with WHO\'s International Classification of Diseases
(ICD-10). This broad definition incorporates many forms, including
depression, anxiety, bipolar, eating disorders and schizophrenia.
[**Mental health disorders remain widely under-reported** --- in our
section on [Data Quality &
Definitions](https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health/#data-availability-on-mental-health)
we discuss the challenges of dealing with this data]{.underline}.
Figures presented in this entry should be taken as estimates of mental
health disorder prevalence --- they do not strictly reflect diagnosis
data (which would provide the global perspective on diagnosis, rather
than actual prevalence differences), but are imputed from a combination
of medical, epidemiological data, surveys and meta-regression modelling
where raw data is unavailable. Further information can be found
[here](https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health#how-is-prevalence-defined-and-measured).
**[In many cases, we may therefore consider reported estimates to be an
under-estimation of true prevalence and disease burden]{.underline}**.
It is also important to keep in mind that the uncertainty of the data on
mental health is generally high so we should be cautious about
interpreting changes over time and differences between countries. Even
taking into account that mental health disorders are likely
underreported, the data presented in this entry demonstrate that mental
health disorders are common and have a high prevalence. Improving
awareness, recognition, support and treatment for this range of
disorders should therefore be an essential focus for global health. The
table below provides a brief summary of the data which follows on mental
health and substance use disorders. Clicking on a given disorder will
take you to the relevant section for further data and information.

### 2NC -- Moral too

#### You have a moral obligation to minimize the risk of suicide

**Fitzpatrick 17** -- (Scott J Fitzpatrick, Centre for Rural and Remote
Mental Health, The University of Newcastle, July 2018, *"[Reshaping the
Ethics of Suicide Prevention: Responsibility, Inequality and Action on
the Social Determinants of Suicide]{.underline}",* Oxford Academic,

Configuring Relations of Responsibility for Suicide Prevention
[**Responsibility for suicide prevention** extends across
multiple]{.underline} domains. [These include the suicidal or previously
suicidal person's responsibility to him or herself and to others to
**minimize risk** by seeking help and complying with treatment
recommendations. Other forms of responsibility are evident in **policy
documents and interventions** directed toward families, communities,
schools, sporting clubs, workplaces, media and health and community
professionals and organizations. These broadly stipulate the importance
of **community ownership and responsibility in preventing suicide**,
although in practice what this means is unclear]{.underline}. In most
cases it is used to establish the foundation for embedding suicide
prevention activities, namely, education, gatekeeper training programs
and responsible media representations within the whole of community.
[Responsibility is also attributed to mental health professionals and
**institutions that have a significant duty in caring for persons** who
are **suicidal. Another form of responsibility is that which has been
taken up by organizations engaged in suicide and mental health education
and promotion. Responsibility for suicide prevention is also assumed by
federal, state and local governments who oversee funding commitments,
outcomes and specific policy directions**]{.underline} (Australian
Government Department of Health and Ageing, 2007). [These relations of
responsibility are characterized by different reciprocities of trust,
care, accountability and obligation and, therefore, require closer
analysis of what competing responsibilities entail (Trnka and Trundle,
2014]{.underline}).

[After]{.underline} the attacks on [September 11, 2001, the White House
made torture its secret weapon in the War on Terror]{.underline}.
Although Washington mobilized its regular military forces for
conventional attacks on Afghanistan and Iraq, [the main
challenge]{.underline} in this new kind of warfare [was a covert
campaign against "nonstate actors," terrorists who moved easily,
elusively, across the Muslim world from Morocco to Manila in "ad hoc
networks that dissolve]{.underline} as soon as the mission is
accomplished." With its countless Cold War victories, overthrowing
enemies on four continents by coups and covert operations, **[the
C]{.underline}**entral [I]{.underline}ntelligence [A]{.underline}gency
had an aura of invincibility and soon [became Washington's chosen
instrument it its battle against Al Qaeda]{.underline}. But, in truth,
the agency's reputation for clandestine derring-do was inflated, and its
qualifications for this new mission were slender indeed.  Though the
CIA was often successful when deployed against states or state agencies,
the agency remained, at base, a centralized Washington bureaucracy,
usually lacking the local knowledge, languages, or street smarts needed
for effective intelligence gathering on nonstate actors. In its
half-century history before September 2001, the CIA had fought only one
covert war comparable to its new anti-terror mission against Al Qaeda,
and the results of these operations during the Vietnam War were
decidedly mixed. Desperate for intelligence about its invisible enemy in
that conflict, an underground movement called the Viet Cong, the agency
soon descended into systematic torture of suspected communists, with
dismal results. Yet forty years later [when the CIA
launched]{.underline} a second, similar [campaign against another
nonstate actor, in this case Islamic terrorists, it soon found it had
few, if any, assets inside Al Qaeda or militant Muslim circles, leading
the agency to revive the torture techniques it had once used in South
Vietnam]{.underline}.

In this otherwise stable security environment, **[threats related to
nuclear weapons and their impact on deterrence have
multiplied.]{.underline}** These have **[emerged from]{.underline}** the
trend towards **[nuclear proliferation and]{.underline}** growth of
**[international terrorism]{.underline}**. The Cold War experience of
**[nuclear restraint and responsibility has been]{.underline}**
effectively **[replaced by]{.underline}** **[grave dangers of
nuclear]{.underline}** and other WMD **[terrorism]{.underline}**. This
has **[led to]{.underline}** **[heightened risks of conflict
escalation]{.underline}**. A **[catastrophic terrorist attack leading to
conventional war, and its escalating towards a nuclear exchange is no
longer an improbability]{.underline}**. This **[risks
c]{.underline}**reating hitherto **[unknown interpretations of
deterrence and dangers to its stability.]{.underline}** The
**[combination of nuclear weapons and terrorism has thus extended the
conflict spectrum]{.underline}**, **[to include terrorist
action]{.underline}** at one end **[to]{.underline}** a **[nuclear
exchange]{.underline}** at the other. While international collective
action and mature statesmanship can reduce and contain this danger, the
risk of having to manage nuclear deterrence under unstable conditions is
real. Deterrence will have to be based from now on multiple instruments
which can be applied in an integrated manner. A combination of
conventional military and nuclear capabilities, of economic sanctions
and of coordinated international responses, all supported by
multilateral organizations like the UN, will form the basis of
deterrence. Nuclear deterrence by itself, and applied by a single state,
is more likely to be counterproductive. The **[targets of]{.underline}**
deterrence and the **[activities]{.underline}** being deterred can
**[range from proliferation]{.underline}** related activities, to use of
international terrorism as instrument of state policy, **[to military
provocation and adventurism.]{.underline}** India views nuclear
deterrence as a means of limited value against the new range of threats
facing it and the international community. A combination of instruments
will therefore need to be utilized to obtain a cumulatively constructive
impact, to prevent the new range of threats from impacting on the
security of a state, or a region or on a global scale. Nuclear
deterrence is therefore in need of being reinterpreted as one amongst a
range of options, and even more as an option of last resort.

These changes in the agency's mission came suddenly. Only four years
after the CIA compiled its 1963 [interrogation manual for use against a
few Soviet counterintelligence targets, its agents were operating forty
interrogation centers in South Vietnam that killed more than twenty
thousand suspects and tortured countless thousands more]{.underline}.
Similarly, just a few months after the [CIA used its harsh techniques on
a few "high-value" Al Qaeda suspects, the practice spread to the
interrogation of hundreds of Afghans and thousands of
Iraqis]{.underline}. In both cases, not only did torture spread, but the
level of abuse escalated relentlessly beyond the scientific patina of
the agency's psychological methods to become pervasively, perversely
brutal. In sum[, the development of CIA techniques at the height of the
Cold War created a covert interrogation capacity that the White House
could deploy at times of crisis,]{.underline} whether in South Vietnam
in 1968 or in Iraq in 2003. Across the span of four decades, there was,
therefore, [a marked continuity in U.S. torture techniques and in the
agency's recourse to assassination as its ultimate weapon in these
covert wars.]{.underline}

**[[War involving]{.mark} significant fractions of the [U.S. and
Russian]{.mark} nuclear [arsenals]{.mark}, which are by far the largest
of any nations, [could have globally catastrophic effects]{.mark} such
as severely reducing food production for years,]{.underline}** 1

U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and Russia could occur
by various routes, including accidental]{.underline}** or unauthorized
launch; deliberate first attack by one nation; and inadvertent attack.
**[In an]{.underline}** accidental or **[unauthorized launch or
detonation, system safeguards or procedures to maintain control over
nuclear weapons fail in such a way that a nuclear weapon or missile
launches or explodes without direction from leaders.]{.underline}** In a
deliberate first attack, the attacking nation decides to attack based on
accurate information about the state of affairs. In an inadvertent
attack, the attacking nation mistakenly concludes that it is under
attack and launches nuclear weapons in what it believes is a
counterattack. 3 (Brinkmanship strategies incorporate elements of all of
the above, in that they involve intentional manipulation of risks from
otherwise accidental or inadvertent launches. 4 ) Over the years,
nuclear strategy was aimed primarily at minimizing risks of intentional
attack through development of deterrence capabilities, and numerous
measures also were taken to reduce probabilities of accidents,
unauthorized attack, and inadvertent war. **[For purposes of deterrence,
both U.S. and Soviet/Russian forces have maintained significant
capabilities to have some forces survive a first attack by the other
side and to launch a subsequent counter-attack]{.underline}**. However,
**[concerns about the extreme disruptions that a first attack would
cause in the other side\'s forces and
[c]{.mark}ommand[-and-c]{.mark}ontrol capabilities led to both sides'
development of capabilities to [detect a first attack and launch a
counter-attack before suffering]{.mark} damage [from the first]{.mark}
attack]{.underline}**. 5 **[Many people believe that with the end of the
Cold War and with improved relations between the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[and Russia, the risk of East-West nuclear
war was significantly reduced]{.underline}**. 6 **[However, it also has
been argued that [inadvertent]{.mark} nuclear [war]{.mark} between the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and Russia [has
continued to present a substantial risk]{.mark}.]{.underline}** 7
**[[While the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[and Russia are not actively
threatening]{.mark} each other]{.underline}** with war, **[they [have
remained ready to launch]{.mark} nuclear missiles in response to
indications of attack.]{.underline}** 8 False indicators of nuclear
attack could be caused in several ways. First, a wide range of events
have already been mistakenly interpreted as indicators of attack,
including weather phenomena, a faulty computer chip, wild animal
activity, and control-room training tapes loaded at the wrong time. 9
Second, **[[terrorist groups]{.mark} or other actors [might cause
attacks]{.mark} on either the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[or Russia [that resemble]{.mark} some kind
of nuclear [attack by the other nation]{.mark} by actions such as
exploding a stolen or improvised nuclear bomb]{.underline}**, 10
**[[especially]{.mark} if such an event occurs [during a crisis]{.mark}
between the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and
Russia.]{.underline}** 11 **[A variety of nuclear terrorism scenarios
are possible.]{.underline}** 12 **[[Al Qaeda has sought]{.mark} to
obtain or construct nuclear [weapons]{.mark} and to use them against the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. 13 Other methods could
involve attempts to circumvent nuclear weapon launch control safeguards
or exploit holes in their security. 14 It has long been argued that
**[the probability of inadvertent nuclear war is significantly higher
during U.S.--Russian crisis conditions]{.underline}**, 15 with the Cuban
Missile Crisis being a prime historical example. It is possible that
U.S.--Russian relations will significantly deteriorate in the future,
increasing nuclear tensions. **[There are a variety of ways for a third

What is of **[the utmost importance is that this entire subject --the
catastrophic environmental consequences of nuclear war -- has been
effectively dropped from the global discussion of nuclear weaponry. The
focus is instead upon "nuclear terrorism", a subject that fits official
narratives and centers upon the danger of [one nuclear
weapon](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-barack-obama-prague-delivered)
being detonated -- yet the scientifically predicted consequences of
nuclear war are never publically acknowledged or
discussed.]{.underline}** **[Why has the existential threat of nuclear
war been effectively omitted from public debate? Perhaps the leaders of
the nuclear weapon states do not want the public to understand that
their nuclear arsenals represent a self-destruct mechanism for the human
race?]{.underline}** Such an understanding could lead to a **[demand
that nuclear weapons be [banned](http://www.icanw.org/pledge/) and
abolished. Consequently, the nuclear weapon states continue to maintain
and modernize their nuclear arsenals, as their leaders remain silent
about the ultimate threat that nuclear war poses to the human
species.]{.underline}**

#### Terrorism leads to extinction.

Accordingly, **[there is a significant and ever-present risk that
terrorists could acquire a nuclear device or fissile material from
Russia as a result of the confluence of Russian economic decline and the
end of stringent Soviet-era nuclear security measures. 39 Terrorist
groups could acquire a nuclear weapon by a number of methods, including
\"steal\[ing\] one intact from the stockpile of a country possessing
such weapons, or \... \[being\] sold or given one by \[\*1438\] such a
country, or \[buying or stealing\] one from another subnational group
that had obtained it in one of these ways.\" 40 Equally threatening,
however, is the risk that terrorists will steal or purchase fissile
material and construct a nuclear device on their own. Very little
material is necessary to construct a highly destructive nuclear
weapon.]{.underline}** 41 Although nuclear devices are extraordinarily
complex, the technical barriers to constructing a workable weapon are
not significant. 42 Moreover, the sheer number of methods that could be
used to deliver a nuclear device into the United States makes it
incredibly likely that terrorists could successfully employ a nuclear
weapon once it was built. 43 **[Accordingly, supply-side controls that
are aimed at preventing terrorists from acquiring nuclear material in
the first place are the most effective means of countering the risk of
nuclear terrorism.]{.underline}** 44 Moreover, the end of the Cold War
eliminated the rationale for maintaining a large military-industrial
complex in Russia, and the nuclear cities were closed. 45 This resulted
in at least 35,000 nuclear scientists becoming unemployed in an economy
that was collapsing. 46 Although the economy has stabilized somewhat,
there \[\*1439\] are still at least 20,000 former scientists who are
unemployed or underpaid and who are too young to retire, 47 raising the
chilling prospect that these scientists will be tempted to sell their
nuclear knowledge, or steal nuclear material to sell, to states or
terrorist organizations with nuclear ambitions. 48 **[The potential
consequences of the unchecked spread of nuclear knowledge and material
to terrorist groups that seek to cause mass destruction in the United
States are truly horrifying. A terrorist attack with a nuclear weapon
would be devastating in terms of immediate human and economic
losses.]{.underline}** 49 M**[oreover, there would be immense political
pressure in the United States to discover the perpetrators and retaliate
with nuclear weapons, massively increasing the number of casualties and
potentially triggering a full-scale nuclear conflict. 50 In addition to
the threat posed by terrorists, leakage of nuclear knowledge and
material from Russia will reduce the barriers that states with nuclear
ambitions face and may trigger widespread proliferation of nuclear
weapons. 51 This proliferation will increase the risk of nuclear attacks
against the United States \[\*1440\] or its allies by hostile states, 52
as well as increase the likelihood that regional conflicts will draw in
the United States and escalate to the use of nuclear
weapons.]{.underline}**

### AT: Immoral

#### No ethical justifications make sense for why torture is bad -- util should guide your calculus

So we can now ask, [if we are willing to act in a way that guarantees
the misery and death of some considerable number of innocent children,
why spare the rod with known terrorists]{.underline}? I find it
genuinely bizarre that while the torture of Osama bin Laden himself
could be expected to provoke convulsions of conscience among our
leaders, the perfectly foreseeable (and therefore accepted) slaughter of
children does not. [What is the difference between pursuing a course of
action where we run the risk of inadvertently subjecting some innocent
men to torture, and pursuing one in which we will inadvertently kill far
greater numbers of innocent men, women, and children]{.underline}?
Rather, it seems obvious that [the misapplication of torture should be
far less troubling to us than collateral damage]{.underline}: there are,
after all, no infants interned at Guantanamo Bay. Torture need not even
impose a significant risk of death or permanent injury on its victims;
while the collaterally damaged are, almost by definition, crippled or
killed. [The ethical divide that seems to be opening up here suggests
that those who are willing to drop bombs might want to abduct the
nearest and dearest of suspected terrorists]{.underline}---their wives,
mothers, and daughters---a[nd torture them as well, assuming anything
profitable to our side might come of it]{.underline}. Admittedly, this
would be a ghastly result to have reached by logical argument, and we
will want to find some way of escaping it. But [there seems no question
that accidentally torturing an innocent man is better than accidentally
blowing him and his children to bits.]{.underline} In this context, we
should note that [many variables influence our feelings about an act of
physical violence]{.underline}. The philosopher Jonathan Glover points
out that "[in modern war, what is most shocking is a poor guide to what
is most harmful]{.underline}." To learn that one's grandfather flew a
bombing mission over Dresden in the Second World War is one thing; to
hear that he killed five little girls and their mother with a shovel is
another. We can be sure that he would have killed many more women and
girls by dropping bombs from pristine heights, and they are likely to
have died equally horrible deaths, but his culpability would not appear
the same. There is much to be said about the disparity here, but the
relevance to the ethics of torture should be obvious. [If you think that
the equivalence between torture and collateral damage does not hold,
because torture is up close and personal while stray bombs aren't, you
stand convicted of a failure of imagination on at least two counts:
first, a moment's reflection on the horrors that must have been visited
upon innocent Afghanis and Iraqis by our bombs will reveal that they are
on par with those of any dungeon. If our intuition about the wrongness
of torture is born of an aversion to how people generally behave while
being tortured, we should note that this particular infelicity could be
circumvented pharmacologically, because paralytic drugs make it
unnecessary for screaming ever to be heard or writhing
seen]{.underline}. We could easily devise methods of torture that would
render a torturer as blind to the plight of his victims as a bomber
pilot is at thirty thousand feet. Consequently, our natural aversion to
the sights and sounds of the dungeon provide no foothold for those who
would argue against the use of torture. To demonstrate just how abstract
the torments of the tortured can be made to seem, we need only imagine
an ideal ["torture pill"---a drug that would deliver both the
instruments of torture and the instrument]{.underline} of their
concealment. [The action of the pill would be to produce transitory
paralysis and transitory misery of a kind that no human being would
willingly submit to a second time. Imagine how we torturers would feel
if, after giving this pill to captive terrorists, each lay down for what
appeared to be an hour's nap only to arise and immediately confess
everything he knows about the workings of his organization]{.underline}.
Might we not be tempted to call it a "truth pill" in the end? [No, there
is no ethical difference to be found in how the suffering of the
tortured or the collaterally damaged appears.]{.underline}

#### Any chance torture reveals information should be taken -- moral concerns are not credible

**Harris \'11** (Sam Harris is an author, neuroscientist, and
philosopher, 5-25-2011, \"In Defense of Torture\", HuffPost, \<span

\[HS\]

[Opponents of torture will be quick to argue that confessions elicited
by torture are notoriously unreliable]{.underline}. Given the foregoing,
however, [this objection seems to lack its usual force]{.underline}.
Make these confessions as unreliable as you like---[the chance that our
interests will be advanced in any instance of torture need only equal
the chance of such occasioned by the dropping of a single
bomb]{.underline}. What was the chance that the dropping of bomb number
117 on Kandahar would effect the demise of Al Qaeda? It had to be pretty
slim. [Enter Khalid Sheikh Mohammed: our most valuable capture in our
war on terror.]{.underline} Here is a character who actually seems to
have stepped out of a philosopher's thought experiment. U.S. officials
now believe that his was the hand that decapitated the Wall Street
Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. Whether or not this is true, [his
membership in Al Qaeda more or less rules out his "innocence" in any
important sense, and his rank in the organization suggests that his
knowledge of planned atrocities must be extensive]{.underline}. [The
bomb has been ticking ever since September 11th, 2001. Given the damage
we were willing to cause to the bodies and minds of innocent children in
Afghanistan and Iraq, our disavowal of torture in the case of Khalid
Sheikh Mohammed seems perverse]{.underline}. [If there is even one
chance in a million that he will tell us something under torture that
will lead to the further dismantling of Al Qaeda, it seems that we
should use every means at our disposal to get him talking]{.underline}.
(In fact, The New York Times has reported that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed
was tortured in a procedure known as "water-boarding," despite our
official disavowal of this practice.) Which way should the balance
swing? [Assuming that we want to maintain a coherent ethical position on
these matters, this appears to be a circumstance of forced choice: if we
are willing to drop bombs, or even risk that rifle rounds might go
astray, we should be willing to torture a certain class of criminal
suspects and military prisoners; if we are unwilling to torture, we
should be unwilling to wage modern war]{.underline}.

#### As a policymaker torture is justified in a decision faced with nuclear terrorism 

**Harris \'19** (Sam Harris is an author, neuroscientist, and
philosopher, 4-07-2019, \" RESPONSE TO CONTROVERSY\",
<https://samharris.org/response-to-controversy/>) \[HS\]

[I am not alone in thinking that there are potential circumstances in
which the use of torture would be ethically justifiable]{.underline}.
The liberal [Senator]{.underline} [Charles Schumer has publicly stated
that most U.S. senators would support torture to find out the location
of a ticking time bomb]{.underline}. Such scenarios have been widely
criticized as unrealistic. But [realism is not the point of these
thought experiments. The point is that unless your argument rules out
torture in idealized cases, you don't have a categorical argument
against torture]{.underline}. [As nuclear and biological terrorism
become increasingly possible, it is in everyone's interest for men and
women of goodwill to determine what should be done if a person appears
to have operational knowledge of an imminent atrocity]{.underline} (and
may even claim to possess such knowledge), but won't otherwise talk
about it.

### More Terror Impact

#### Extinction.

In this otherwise stable security environment, **[threats related to
nuclear weapons and their impact on deterrence have
multiplied.]{.underline}** These have **[emerged from]{.underline}** the
trend towards **[nuclear proliferation and]{.underline}** growth of
**[international terrorism]{.underline}**. The Cold War experience of
**[nuclear restraint and responsibility has been]{.underline}**
effectively **[replaced by]{.underline}** **[grave dangers of
nuclear]{.underline}** and other WMD **[terrorism]{.underline}**. This
has **[led to]{.underline}** **[heightened risks of conflict
escalation]{.underline}**. A **[catastrophic terrorist attack leading to
conventional war, and its escalating towards a nuclear exchange is no
longer an improbability]{.underline}**. This **[risks
c]{.underline}**reating hitherto **[unknown interpretations of
deterrence and dangers to its stability.]{.underline}** The
**[combination of nuclear weapons and terrorism has thus extended the
conflict spectrum]{.underline}**, **[to include terrorist
action]{.underline}** at one end **[to]{.underline}** a **[nuclear
exchange]{.underline}** at the other. While international collective
action and mature statesmanship can reduce and contain this danger, the
risk of having to manage nuclear deterrence under unstable conditions is
real. Deterrence will have to be based from now on multiple instruments
which can be applied in an integrated manner. A combination of
conventional military and nuclear capabilities, of economic sanctions
and of coordinated international responses, all supported by
multilateral organizations like the UN, will form the basis of
deterrence. Nuclear deterrence by itself, and applied by a single state,
is more likely to be counterproductive. The **[targets of]{.underline}**
deterrence and the **[activities]{.underline}** being deterred can
**[range from proliferation]{.underline}** related activities, to use of
international terrorism as instrument of state policy, **[to military
provocation and adventurism.]{.underline}** India views nuclear
deterrence as a means of limited value against the new range of threats
facing it and the international community. A combination of instruments
will therefore need to be utilized to obtain a cumulatively constructive
impact, to prevent the new range of threats from impacting on the
security of a state, or a region or on a global scale. Nuclear
deterrence is therefore in need of being reinterpreted as one amongst a
range of options, and even more as an option of last resort.

#### Terror attacks go nuclear.

Winter, and Human Extinction"; 10/14/15;
<https://fas.org/pir-pubs/nuclear-war-nuclear-winter-and-human-extinction/>;
BF)

What is of **[the utmost importance is that this entire subject --the
catastrophic environmental consequences of nuclear war -- has been
effectively dropped from the global discussion of nuclear weaponry. The
focus is instead upon "nuclear terrorism", a subject that fits official
narratives and centers upon the danger of [one nuclear
weapon](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-barack-obama-prague-delivered)
being detonated -- yet the scientifically predicted consequences of
nuclear war are never publically acknowledged or
discussed.]{.underline}** **[Why has the existential threat of nuclear
war been effectively omitted from public debate? Perhaps the leaders of
the nuclear weapon states do not want the public to understand that
their nuclear arsenals represent a self-destruct mechanism for the human
race?]{.underline}** Such an understanding could lead to a **[demand
that nuclear weapons be [banned](http://www.icanw.org/pledge/) and
abolished. Consequently, the nuclear weapon states continue to maintain
and modernize their nuclear arsenals, as their leaders remain silent
about the ultimate threat that nuclear war poses to the human
species.]{.underline}**

Accordingly, **[there is a significant and ever-present risk that
terrorists could acquire a nuclear device or fissile material from
Russia as a result of the confluence of Russian economic decline and the
end of stringent Soviet-era nuclear security measures. 39 Terrorist
groups could acquire a nuclear weapon by a number of methods, including
\"steal\[ing\] one intact from the stockpile of a country possessing
such weapons, or \... \[being\] sold or given one by \[\*1438\] such a
country, or \[buying or stealing\] one from another subnational group
that had obtained it in one of these ways.\" 40 Equally threatening,
however, is the risk that terrorists will steal or purchase fissile
material and construct a nuclear device on their own. Very little
material is necessary to construct a highly destructive nuclear
weapon.]{.underline}** 41 Although nuclear devices are extraordinarily
complex, the technical barriers to constructing a workable weapon are
not significant. 42 Moreover, the sheer number of methods that could be
used to deliver a nuclear device into the United States makes it
incredibly likely that terrorists could successfully employ a nuclear
weapon once it was built. 43 **[Accordingly, supply-side controls that
are aimed at preventing terrorists from acquiring nuclear material in
the first place are the most effective means of countering the risk of
nuclear terrorism.]{.underline}** 44 Moreover, the end of the Cold War
eliminated the rationale for maintaining a large military-industrial
complex in Russia, and the nuclear cities were closed. 45 This resulted
in at least 35,000 nuclear scientists becoming unemployed in an economy
that was collapsing. 46 Although the economy has stabilized somewhat,
there \[\*1439\] are still at least 20,000 former scientists who are
unemployed or underpaid and who are too young to retire, 47 raising the
chilling prospect that these scientists will be tempted to sell their
nuclear knowledge, or steal nuclear material to sell, to states or
terrorist organizations with nuclear ambitions. 48 **[The potential
consequences of the unchecked spread of nuclear knowledge and material
to terrorist groups that seek to cause mass destruction in the United
States are truly horrifying. A terrorist attack with a nuclear weapon
would be devastating in terms of immediate human and economic
losses.]{.underline}** 49 M**[oreover, there would be immense political
pressure in the United States to discover the perpetrators and retaliate
with nuclear weapons, massively increasing the number of casualties and
potentially triggering a full-scale nuclear conflict. 50 In addition to
the threat posed by terrorists, leakage of nuclear knowledge and
material from Russia will reduce the barriers that states with nuclear
ambitions face and may trigger widespread proliferation of nuclear
weapons. 51 This proliferation will increase the risk of nuclear attacks
against the United States \[\*1440\] or its allies by hostile states, 52
as well as increase the likelihood that regional conflicts will draw in
the United States and escalate to the use of nuclear
weapons.]{.underline}**

**[Remember how the London Olympics were supposedly left vulnerable to
terrorists]{.underline}** after the security firm hired for the games
admitted that it couldn\'t supply enough manpower? This \"humiliating
shambles\" forced the British government to call in 3,500 security
personnel of its own, and led GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney to
utter some tactless remarks about Britain\'s alleged mismanagement
during his official \"Foot-in-Mouth\" foreign tour last month. **[Well,
surprise, surprise]{.underline}**. **[Not only was there no terrorist
attack]{.underline}**, the Games themselves came off rather well. There
were the inevitable minor glitches, of course, but no disasters and some
quite impressive organizational achievements. And of course, athletes
from around the world delivered inspiring, impressive, heroic, and
sometimes disappointing performances, which is what the Games are all
about. Two lessons might be drawn from this event. The first is that the
head-long rush to privatize everything \-- including the provision of
security \-- has some obvious downsides. When markets and private firms
fail, it is the state that has to come to the rescue. It was true after
the 2007-08 financial crisis, it\'s true in the ongoing euro-mess, and
it was true in the Olympics. Bear that in mind when Romney and new VP
nominee Paul Ryan tout the virtues of shrinking government, especially
the need to privatize Social Security and Medicare. The second lesson is
that **[we continue to over-react to the \"terrorist
threat.\"]{.underline}** **[Here I recommend you read John Mueller and
Mark G. Stewart\'s The Terrorism Delusion]{.underline}**: America\'s
Overwrought Response to September 11, in the latest issue of
International Security. **[Mueller and Stewart analyze 50 cases of
supposed \"Islamic terrorist plots\"]{.underline}** against the United
States, **[and show how virtually all of the perpetrators
were]{.underline}** (in their words) **[\"incompetent, ineffective,
unintelligent, idiotic, ignorant, unorganized, misguided, muddled,
amateurish, dopey, unrealistic, moronic, irrational and
foolish.\"]{.underline}** **[They quote]{.underline}** former Glenn
Carle, **[former deputy national intelligence]{.underline}** officer for
transnational threats saying \"**[we must see jihadists for the small,
lethal, disjointed and miserable opponents that they are,\" noting
further that al Qaeda\'s \"capabilities are far inferior to its
desires]{.underline}**.\" Further, Mueller and Stewart estimate that
expenditures on domestic homeland security (i.e., not counting the wars
in Iraq or Afghanistan) have increased by more than \$1 trillion since
9/11, even though **[the annual risk of dying in a domestic terrorist
attack is about 1 in 3.5 million]{.underline}**. Using conservative
assumptions and conventional risk-assessment methodology, they estimate
that for these expenditures to be cost-effective \"they would have had
to deter, prevent, foil or protect against 333 very large attacks that
would otherwise have been successful every year.\" Finally, they worry
that this exaggerated sense of danger has now been \"internalized\":
even when politicians and \"terrorism experts\" aren\'t hyping the
danger, the public still sees the threat as large and imminent. As they
conclude: \... Americans seems to have internalized their anxiety about
terrorism, and politicians and policymakers have come to believe that
they can defy it only at their own peril.  Concern about appearing to be
soft on terrorism has replaced concern about seeming to be soft on
communism, a phenomenon that lasted far longer than the dramatic that
generated it \... This extraordinarily exaggerated and essentially
delusional response may prove to be perpetual.\" Which is another way of
saying that **[you should be prepared to keep standing in those pleasant
and efficient TSA lines for the rest of your life]{.underline}**, and to
keep paying for far-flung foreign interventions designed to \"root out\"
those nasty jihadis.

#### [Threat inflation]{.underline}\--Expert reports are wrong

**Mearsheimer 11** (John J. is the R. Wendell Harrison Distinguished
Service Professor of Political Science at the University of Chicago,
"Imperial By Design" Jan/Feb The National Interest
<http://nationalinterest.org/print/article/imperial-by-design-4576>, BF)

Finally, **[the ability of terrorists to strike]{.underline}** the
American homeland **[has been blown out of]{.underline}** all
**[proportion]{.underline}**. In the nine years since 9/11,
**[government officials and terrorist experts have issued countless
warnings]{.underline}** that **[another major attack]{.underline}** on
American soil **[is probable]{.underline}**---even imminent. **[But this
is simply not the case]{.underline}**.3 **[The only attempts we have
seen are a few failed solo attacks]{.underline}** by individuals with
links to al-Qaeda like the "shoe bomber," who attempted to blow up an
American Airlines flight from Paris to Miami in December 2001, and the
"underwear bomber," who tried to blow up a Northwest Airlines flight
from Amsterdam to Detroit in December 2009. So, **[we do have a
terrorism problem, but it is hardly an existential
threat]{.underline}.** In fact, **[it is a minor threat]{.underline}**.
Perhaps the scope of the challenge is best captured by Ohio State
political scientist John Mueller's telling comment that "**[the number
of Americans killed by international terrorism since the
late]{.underline}** 19**[60s]{.underline}** . . . **[is about the same
as the number killed over the same period by lightning, or by
accident-causing deer, or by severe allergic reactions to
peanuts]{.underline}**."

(Nancy, Doctoral Researcher for @ the Centre for Trust Peace and Social
Relations, "Violent Conflicts and Civil Strife in West Africa: Causes,
Challenges and Prospects," Stability: International Journal of Security
and Development pp. 10-11) // WhtCbn

Despite efforts made to prevent and end violent conflicts in West
Africa, the region continues to experience sporadic violence and 16
volatile security challenges. The major challenge to ending conflict in
West Africa can be attributed to the poor understanding of the
fundamental causes of the conflict. For example in the current Malian
crisis, **[the misplaced understanding]{.underline}** of the
international community **[that the root cause of the conflict is the
terrorist activities]{.underline}** by Islamists in the region; thus,
placing it in the context of 'fight against terror' has in part hindered
the process of finding lasting solution for the conflict (Taylor 2013).
In that **[it has shifted the focus from the deep seated root causes of
bad governance, corruption, discrimination, ethnic marginalization, and
unstructured military governance]{.underline}**) **[to terrorist
activities]{.underline}** which is mainly an offshoot of the
conflict(Bourkhars 2013). Other challenges identified by scholars
include weak institutional structures; language barrier
(AngloFrancophone-Lusophone); lack of skills and expertise in conflict
mediation and dialogue; **[lack of resources]{.underline}**; lack of
political will; lack of coordination between and among ECOWAS agencies
and its partners; and noninclusive peace-building processes. These
factors **[make ending violent conflicts in the region increasingly
delicate and challenging]{.underline}** (Afolabi 2009). In affirming the
above, Aning and Bah (2009) identified a disjoint with regards to
collaboration and coordination between and among ECOWAS institutions and
its external partners (Aning and Bah 2009). This they emphasized is
affecting the implementation of the ECPF which was designed to
'strengthen human security and incorporate conflict prevention
activities as well as aspects of peace-building' (Aning and Bah 2009).
This has in part is also affecting the work operation of the ECOWARN.
For instance, recently, the regional early warning system was criticized
for not detecting the signs that led to the April 2012 coup d'état in
Guinea-Bissau as the early warning mechanism continued to grapple with
internal and external coordination challenges (IPI 2012). **[Lack of
resources of states and the subregional body also hinders the resolution
of conflicts in the sub-region]{.underline}**. Financial, human and
material resources for conflict resolution have been some of the
sub-region's challenges. For instance, most **[national security forces
lack the requisite equipment and capacity needed to adequately disarm
belligerent groups]{.underline}**. For example, **[in the Malian
conflict]{.underline}**, **[lack of equipment and capacity of the
national army has been noted as one of the challenges preventing
successive governments from addressing the]{.underline}** Tuareg
**[rebellions]{.underline}** since the 1960s (Chew 2012**[). In
Liberia]{.underline}** also, despite the acclaimed heroic intervention
of ECOMOG in 1996, material challenges such as **[lack of
equipment,]{.underline}** arms, sea and airlift capacities, and
machinery to some extent, **[affected the effective implementation of
the]{.underline}** ECOMOG **[mandate which in part contributed to the
re-surfacing of the conflict]{.underline}** in 1999 after peace was
restored in 1997 (Isma 2001).

#### Police Stability key to prevent lone wolf terror

**Barnes 12**

(Beau D., Attorney at Kobre & Kim, Judicial Law Clerk to the Honorable
Nathaniel M. Gorton, BA from Lewis and Clark College, JD from Boston
University School of Law, "CONFRONTING THE ONE-MAN WOLF PACK: ADAPTING
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PROSECUTION RESPONSES TO THE THREAT OF LONE WOLF
TERRORISM," Boston University Law Review, Vol. 92, No. 1613) // WhtCbn

In recent years, Al Qaeda and other members of the global jihadist
movement have specifically promoted "smaller-scale, less technically
complex tactics . . . \[which are\] more difficult for law enforcement
and intelligence operatives in the United States to identify in
advance."189 One well-documented "online training camp" exhorted
aspiring mujahideen that they need not "travel to other lands" because
"\[a\]lone, in your home or with a group of your brothers, you too can
begin to execute the training program."190 The shift to online
activities was part of Al Qaeda's "strategy to ensure that its war with
the U.S. will continue even if many of its cells across the world are
broken up and its current leaders are killed or captured."191 Declaring
that **[Al Qaeda's strategy now principally focuses on disaffected
loners perhaps overstates the point]{.underline}**, but **[the law
enforcement efforts of the past decade have drastically reduced the
number of options available to prospective terrorists]{.underline}**.
Lone wolf terrorism, then, is not just a subset of the broader category
of homegrown terrorism, but is, more accurately, **[an ineluctable
tactical evolution of the Al Qaeda social movement]{.underline}**.
Terrorists "learn from experience and modify their tactics and targets
to exploit perceived vulnerabilities and avoid observed
strengths."**[192 Al Qaeda's members are]{.underline}** simply
"**[adapt\[ing\] to their hostile physical
environment.]{.underline}**"193 Al Qaeda's evolution should come as no
surprise. As the quintessential practitioners of "asymmetric warfare" --
wherein a much weaker party attacks a much stronger party by targeting
its weak points194 -- terrorist organizations have always evolved in
ways that play to their strengths. **[Terrorist organizations "evolve
and transform in response to internal and external
pressures]{.underline}**. Like any social organization, they adapt to
their changing environment in a variety of ways, often splintering into
different entities or merging with other groups."195 **[The global
jihadist movement]{.underline}**, "\[l\]ike any sophisticated enemy, . .
. **[adapts its approaches and methods to what the United States
does]{.underline}**."196 Of course, **[one cannot give all of the
"credit" for lone wolf terrorism to Al Qaeda;]{.underline}** **[it is a
complex]{.underline}** social **[phenomenon]{.underline}** with multiple
influencing factors, and it would be too simplistic to ascribe to a
mono-causal explanation. Indeed, the issue of causation itself can be
complicated, as the Al Qaeda movement has at times only embraced lone
wolves after their attacks.197 However, **[Al Qaeda's strategic embrace
of lone wolves remains a significant factor in the emerging
threat]{.underline}**. From this analysis, a general picture emerges of
the contemporary lone wolf terrorist who shares only an ideological
affinity with the broader radical Islamic terrorist movement. **[This
individual]{.underline}** uses the Internet as a source of both
ideological and operational support, and **[is capable of
terrorism]{.underline}**, but only with the most basic means. The lack
of training, weapons, and manpower means that complex operations against
protected targets are passed over in favor of simpler attacks against

#### That triggers WMD lone wolf attacks

[As the history of guerilla warfare has demonstrated, one of the most
important objectives of an insurgency is to survive.]{.underline} More
often than not, guerilla wars are not won militarily; rather insurgents
persist in their struggle until they force a political solution to the
conflict. Historically, the critical factor that enables an insurgency
to persist over a long period of time is support from the populace.
[[New technology]{.mark}, however, [allows for]{.mark} smaller and
[smaller groups to remain viable]{.mark} even [without]{.mark} a broad
[base of support]{.mark}.]{.underline} Chris Anderson of Wired magazine
developed the concept of the ''long tail'' to explain how in the new
business environment with platforms such as Amazon, firms can profit by
selling previously hard-to-find items to a larger number of customers
instead of selling only a smaller variety of popular items in large
quantities.10 Likewise, as Thomas Rid and Marc Hecker observed in their
study War 2.0: Irregular Warfare in the Information Age, [a similar
[logic applies to]{.mark} extremist and terrorist groups in the sense
that it no longer requires a large popular following to survive over
time. A relatively low number of [highly motivated]{.mark}, partly
self-recruited, [and geographically dispersed followers]{.mark} can
share a cause without broader popular appeal, thus making niche
terrorism possible.]{.underline} As a consequence, the critical mass of
people necessary to establish a viable terrorist movement has been
drastically lowered.11 [Various political, social, and technological
developments have contributed to the miniaturization of terrorist
organizations and the increasing frequency of lone wolf
terrorism.]{.underline} Geopolitically, the dissolution of the Soviet
Union drastically changed the security environment within which
terrorists operate. During the Cold War, several communist states were
covert supporters of terrorist groups. At the time, supporting terrorism
was viewed as furthering the foreign policy objectives of the Soviet
bloc.12 In her classic study, The Terror Network, Claire Sterling
maintained that for much of the period from the late 1960s to the early
1980s, the Soviet Union was at the center of a global terrorist
apparatus.13 Although critics dismissed Sterling's thesis when it was
first released, subsequent examinations of the Soviet and East German
archives after the collapse of the Red Bloc suggest that she was not far
off the mark after all.14 Initially after the Cold War, terrorism went
into steep decline in large part because several leading terrorist
groups lost material support fromcommunist states.15 With the collapse
of Soviet Communism, the world entered what Charles Krauthammer referred
to as the ''unipolar'' era in which one sole superpower predominates.16
In an era of U.S.-dominated globalization, states have more to gain by
accommodation with the West rather than confrontation. In many parts of
the world, the setting is not conducive to large, clandestine groups
insofar as many foreign governments are coordinating their
counterterrorism efforts with the U.S. government, as they seek to
dismantle terrorist organizations and deny them funding and resources.
This trend accelerated after 9=11.17 [Technology has contributed to the
miniaturization of terrorism as well.]{.underline} One the one hand, new
surveillance technology has enabled governments to better monitor
dissident groups and potential terrorists. On the other hand, [the
**[emergence of new tech]{.mark}nology** has the potential to [serve as
a force multiplier for terrorists]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, the
Internet allows like-minded activists to operate on their own initiative
without the direction of a formal organization. Enhanced communication
capabilities allow for new flexible models of organization that eschew
traditional leadership structures and enable collaboration by disparate
parties that are geographically dispersed. Furthermore, the rise of the
''new media'' has led to a diffusion of soft power around the world that
has increased access to groups and individuals who have traditionally
not had much influence in the marketplace of ideas. The new media
developed concomitant with the Web 2.0, which arose after the Dot-com
bubble burst in the year 2000. Out of the rubble, a new crop of new
Web-based companies and services emerged that offered interactivity and
''user-generated content.'' The Web 2.0 encompasses an array of
interactive communications facilitated by a rapidly expanding set of
platforms, including blogs, Web forums, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube
that are linked together in innovative ways.18 The rise of the new media
ushered in a new era of communications, which allowed much greater and
broader participation from users, not only in the spheres of commerce
and social networking, but in terrorism and insurgency as well.19 Today,
[we are witnessing the age of the ''**[super-empowered
individual]{.mark}**,'' who if adequately armed [with a weapon of mass
destruction]{.mark} (WMD), [could wreak]{.mark} unprecedented
[havoc]{.mark}.]{.underline}20 [As the leaderless resistance concept
gains popularity in terrorist and extremist subcultures and [as our
infrastructure becomes]{.mark} more and more [interconnected]{.mark},
just a few determined lone wolves have the potential to cause greater
mayhem.]{.underline} These developments mark a major departure from
previous models of terrorism and insurgency. Thomas X. Hammes elaborated
on Lind's framework in the book The Sling and the Stone: On War in the
21st Century, in which he defined fourth generation warfare as an
evolved form of insurgency that endeavors to use all available
networks---political, social, and military, to convince the enemy's
decision makers that their strategic goals are unattainable or not worth
the cost.21 [To be effective, strategy must evolve to reflect the
current operational environment.]{.underline} Like other previous
variants of conflict and warfare that preceded it, the salience of
leaderless resistance comes about from a confluence of several
political, social, and technological trends. Conceivably, a
fifth-generation warfare could take the form of leaderless resistance in
which individuals and small cells commit acts of terrorism on their own
initiative with no traditional command-and-control hierarchy. [Numerous
trends are leading to the [miniaturization of terrorism]{.mark},
warfare, and conflict around the world.]{.underline} New Internet
platforms allow for faster and more efficient communications of which
terrorists can now avail themselves. Greater interconnectedness also
makes infrastructure more vulnerable to disruption as a perturbation
could precipitate a cascading effect throughout the system. [The
[availability of]{.mark} more [**lethal weapons** and **dual use
technology**]{.mark} could lead to deadlier attacks.]{.underline}
Finally, although the historical process of globalization has improved
the life opportunities of many people, it can be highly disruptive as it
upturns relations among citizens, cultures, economies, societies, and
governments. Several factors make leaderless resistance a potentially
effective strategy. Although the state's capacity to monitor is
substantial, individuals are still able to operate under the radar
screen and commit violence with little predictability. For instance,
having no criminal record other than minor offenses, Anders Behrig
Breivik was able to procure firearms and fertilizer for making his bomb
without raising red flags. His attacks seemed to come out of nowhere.22
[Leaderless resistance can serve as a catalyst spurring others to move
from thought to action. The [tactic can produce a demonstration effect
in that violence spawns copycats]{.mark}.]{.underline}23 Extraordinary
examples of leaderless resistance serve to recruit new members to the
network. Those actions that are unsuccessful are lost or discarded.24
Lone wolves do not require expensive or sophisticated equipment, as
evidenced by the D.C. snipers who used a semi-automatic rifle and a 1990
Chevrolet Caprice to terrorize the area. Leaderless resistance makes the
penetration of terrorist movements difficult because lone wolves work
alone and they have no information on other activists. Further, the mass
media can amplify the exploits of lone wolves. Finally, open societies
make leaderless resistance easier to carry out because there are
numerous soft targets.25 Nevertheless, there are measures that can be
applied to mitigate the risk of lone wolf terrorism.

As discussed in section I of this chapter, **[the market for new
law-enforcement products]{.underline}** in the Caucasus and Central Asia
**[is continuing to open]{.underline}** up**[,]{.underline}** allowing a
wider range of companies to showcase their products. **[Defence and
security equipment-manufacturing companies are keen to take advantage of
what are perceived to be lucrative emerging markets]{.underline}**
**[and exploit potential avenues for]{.underline}** new
**[sales]{.underline}**. For example, **[Beretta rifles have been known
to be deployed in Turkmenistan]{.underline}** since at least 2012;
according to news reports from April 2014, the President of Turkmenistan
met with the Vice President and Managing Director of Italy-based Pietro
Beretta SpA to discuss possibilities for further cooperation.94 **[Other
trade opportunities are increasingly available to international
companies]{.underline}** wishing to promote their goods in the region.
Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine have all hosted annual or
biennial international trade exhibitions where companies from many
different states display and offer for sale law-enforcement equipment.
All four countries hosted such fairs in 2014, while Azerbaijan also
hosted the inaugural Azerbaijan International Defence Industry
Exhibition (ADEX) in Baku in September 2014. While the Ukrainian
exhibition had fewer representatives from outside of Ukraine,
**[representatives from companies based in the]{.underline}** Caucasus
as well as from China, Europe, Israel, South Korea and the **[USA were
present]{.underline}** at the other law-enforcement exhibitions in
2014.95 **[Differing strategic alliances have understandably influenced
the equipment manufactured or purchased by states in the
region]{.underline}**. For example, Israeli, Turkish and **[US
crowd-control vehicles, weapons and ammunition have been observed being
deployed in Azerbaijan and Georgia]{.underline}**, both of **[which have
increasingly close ties to these three]{.underline}** significant
**['producer' states]{.underline}**. While certain equipment
manufactured by Western companies is accompanied by a (comparatively)
high price tag, the location of centres of manufacturing in Asia---and,
in particular, in China---has meant that large quantities of police and
security equipment is available relatively cheaply, thus allowing for
the cost-effective equipping of police forces. A 2013 news article
highlighted the issues relevant to the growth of new sources of supply
for lawenforcement equipment: Besides leading manufacturer Brazil in
Latin America, **[several new suppliers]{.underline}** for nonlethal
weaponry **[have cropped up, posing a challenge both on price and
delivery]{.underline}**. **[Manufacturers in the United States and
elsewhere in the West are up against rivals who compete on price,
payment terms and lack of parliamentary controls that often come in the
way of lucrative arms exports]{.underline}**.96 Any state or agency
wishing to purchase and deploy equipment should conduct a robust and
independent selection, assessment and testing regime prior to any
deployment, rather than relying on company data. Table 4.2 is drawn from
publicly available licensing data and photographic evidence of equipment
being deployed and shows transfers of law-enforcement equipment from
external sources to the region since 2001.97 Table 4.3 lists companies
manufacturing law-enforcement equipment whose products are known to
either be marketed in the region or transferred to end users in the
states being evaluated.

**[Procuring new equipment]{.underline}** for the ANA **[was one

international donations, but in 2008 it received permission from the
Afghan government to vet all donated equipment to ensure that it matched
identified requirements and that adequate logistical support was

capabilities in 2007, even though procuring large amounts of equipment
necessarily took time. By February 2008, the ANA had 60 percent of its
critical equipment on hand, up from 53 percent the previous August. Yet
for 21 of the 55 critical items (38 percent**[), less than 50 percent of

aspects, need to be robustly transparent and ethical, and the police

available; the hiring of personnel with inadequate professional skills;
**[lack of basic equipment]{.underline}** at the station level and
during investigations; **[poor morale of police officers]{.underline}**
owing to inadequate living conditions and low salaries; **[and high

example, the LHRC highlighted the case of the Kishapu Police Post, which
is also the designated District Police Office in a converted garage that
is "small, old, dilapidated" and has only one main room, and one cell to
keep those arrested and detained. Consequently, women detainees are made
to sleep in the main room, which is also the reception and staff office
used by three officers.318 Worryingly, in many areas, **[police lack
essential equipment]{.underline}** such as vehicles and petrol, which,
according to one Officer Commanding the District "does lead to us
selling our autonomy to ensure justice prevails and as such favour those
who donate towards our cause".319 After inspecting 255 police stations
between 2002 and2012, CHRAGG also found that: Most stations do not
have reliable means of transport and hence face problems in transporting
suspects, attending calls for assistance and investigating crimes.
There is a shortage of accommodation for police officers, and those
that do exist are in need of repair. Although there are separate cells
for men and women, there are no separate cells for children as required
under law, and so children are held in detention with adults. In some
cases, the cells are overcrowded and too small for the number of
detainees. Some cells had poor ventilation and inadequate lighting, and
most cells still used buckets as toilets, and had problems accessing
safe drinking water. There was often a shortage of police officers to
staff the station, and **[a lack of sufficient equipment.]{.underline}**

the country is not always above board,\" he said. **[\"They could ship
it in several pieces so it\'s not in a single piece, for example.\" And
even companies such as Electronic Defense, which does not sell to
individuals or on the Internet, may unwittingly export their
technology]{.underline}**. A contractor working on behalf of the South
African government, for example, asked Electronic Defense three years
ago for a sample of a stun belt and stun gun so South African prison
officials could evaluate their need for such devices. **[\"We sent a
couple of samples and never got them back]{.underline}**. **[You try
getting them back from the broker, but you just get passed from one
person to the next.]{.underline}** What do you do?\" said Kaufman, who
has no means of tracking the devices or even knowing if they are still
in African hands. **[South Korea never returned stun devices sent there
for evaluation]{.underline}** five years ago, Kaufman said. **[\"I do
suspect that when that happens, a lot of the technology gets
copied.]{.underline}** **[They\'ll copy it to the best of their
ability,\" he said. Or they may sell it to a third country or a
nongovernmental group. South Africa now has seven companies
manufacturing or distributing stun devices, including one that markets
stun belts. Most online sellers include notices on their Web sites
explaining international restrictions on stun devices, but they make
clear that once the product is shipped to a buyer, it\'s up to the buyer
to follow the law. \"We do deal with some people who resell, and,
really, we don\'t have any way of knowing what their regulations might
be if they\'re selling it somewhere else]{.underline}**,\" said Lowell

NGOs such as Amnesty were critical for generating the political will for
this ban by relentlessly campaigning for effective change and feeding
the media strong stories on how such equipment was actually used. Seven
years after the STOA report, the European Commission brought in the
Regulation No.1236/2005 **[concerning trade in goods which could be used
for capital punishment, torture and other ill treatment,]{.underline}**
which came into effect on 31 July 2006. The regulation was necessary but
not sufficient instrument to outlaw the trade. **[Amnesty identified a
series of loopholes including a failure to ban the import of such
technologies, a failure to outlaw]{.underline}** "transhipment" through
the EC, **[a failure to stop brokering and a failure to add a catchall
clause to extend control to all types of similar
equipment]{.underline}**. \[17\] A vital ingredient to rectifying these
glaring failures was the extraordinary comedian/activist Mark Thomas.
Mark energized a new generation of activists to take on the arms trade
and human rights violations through a series of hard hitting TV
programmes. He became more knowledgeable than most academics on the
minutiae and loopholes of the trade and helped forge powerful alliances
amongst human rights NGOs and research activists -- to the extent of
providing master classes on loopholes in UK law to Parliamentary Select
Committees. **[Mark said arms dealing]{.underline}** from the UK **[was
so easy and unregulated that children could easily set up as arms
brokers]{.underline}**. He proved his point by helping two schools in
Oxfordshire and Dublin do just that -- 'After School Arms Clubs'. **[The
kids were offered weapons, leg irons and even managed to buy and broker
electric shock devices and sting sticks]{.underline}**. Their
professional press briefings at the Irish and Westminster parliaments
helped to further tighten new controls on some of these loopholes, at
least in the UK. \[18\] **[There was certainly an urgent need to halt
the promotion of this type of equipment]{.underline}**. As the
regulation against torture and execution supplies was initiated in 2005,
I attended the 8th Janes Conference on Non-lethal Weapons at Leeds Royal
Armouries. The UK Department for Trade and Investment (DTI) were present
promoting British arms sales, but they also have a regulatory function.
When I spotted that **[one of the sponsors of the Janes' conference had
literature promoting electroshock technology]{.underline}**, inspired by
Mark, I asked the DTI staff to arrest the sponsors. Their stall was
quickly emptied of literature and feathers were ruffled but there were
no arrests. More recently, **[the Omega Foundation found catalogues at
the Milipol exhibition]{.underline}** in Paris in November 2015,
**[promoting]{.underline}** banned equipment such as **[thumb-cuffs,
spiked batons and weighted leg restraints]{.underline}**. Omega
reported: "**[A set of weighted leg irons and a spiked shield were
physically on display at this event]{.underline}**. As of 28 September,
the website of German company PKI Electronic Intelligence **[GmbH
continued to advertise banned 60,000 volt electric stun
hand-cuffs]{.underline}** with the chilling tagline "You never saw an
escaping person stop so quickly!" \[19\] Furthermore: "**[The global
market is rife with sinister equipment like leg chains and spiked batons
which can easily be turned into tools of torture]{.underline}**.
**[Introducing tighter EU restrictions on the sale, brokering and
promotion of these devices will bring us a step closer to eradicating
this shameful trade]{.underline}**," (Ara Marcen Naval, Advocate Advisor
for Arms Control, Security Trade and Human Rights at Amnesty
International)." \[20\] Extending European torture and execution free
zones Indeed, a network of NGOs including Amnesty, Omega and Reprieve
continued to successfully lobby for an effective closing of these
loopholes. \[21\] The European Commission responded in 2012 by
**[setting up an expert committee to]{.underline}** painstakingly
**[examine every form of security equipment which might be used to
violate human rights through torture]{.underline}** or execution. It was
a formidable task and the committee reported in 2013. The resolution
amending the earlier regulation was voted in by a huge majority of 612
in favour, 11 against, 54 abstentions. \[22\] **[The Regulation has
already had a direct impact on the trade and the global death count of
state executions, especially in the US where it has cut off supplies of
chemicals required for lethal injection]{.underline}**. Most recently
Pfizer joined the ban. \[23\] Closing the EU execution drugs supply

as tear gas, handcuffs and plastic bullets has legitimate policing uses,
**[Amnesty says many of the devices marketed by these companies are

Executions rise in 2013, with China topping list \"Chinese authorities

co-authored with the Omega Research Foundation calls on China to
immediately ban the production and trade of inherently cruel and abusive
equipment. It also urged Beijing to suspend or deny trade license for
the supply of equipment when there is a substantial risk that the
equipment will be used to commit or facilitate serious human rights
abuses. **[Amnesty said the global trade in law enforcement equipment is
poorly controlled]{.underline}** and China is not alone in its failure
to regulate the supply of law enforcement equipment to countries where
there is a clear risk that it will be misused. It added that all
countries should heed the report\'s recommendations. **[As many as 29
Chinese companies make electric stun batons that allow security
officials to apply painful multiple shocks to sensitive areas of the
body such as the groin without leaving long-lasting physical
traces]{.underline}**. A greater number of companies make restraint
devices such as weighted leg cuffs. Spiked batons have been exported to
security forces in Nepal and Thailand and have been reportedly used by
police in Cambodia, while Chinese made electric shock batons are being
carried by police in Ghana, Senegal, Egypt and Madagascar, the report
said. **[Another example highlighted shows how Chinese-made riot control
equipment was used to suppress protests]{.underline}** against the
rising cost of living in Uganda, killing at least 33. **[\"China\'s
flawed export system has allowed the trade in torture and repression to
prosper,\" Wilcken said.]{.underline}** The report also documents how
electric shock batons, mechanical restraints and other devices are
widely used in detention centers throughout China.

numbers of Chinese companies are profiting from the trade in tools of
torture and repression, fuelling human rights abuses across the
world]{.underline}**," said Patrick Wilcken, security trade and human
rights researcher at Amnesty International. **["This trade -- which
causes immense suffering -- is flourishing because the Chinese
authorities have done nothing to stop companies supplying these
sickening devices]{.underline}** for export or to prevent policing
equipment falling into the hands of known human rights abusers."
**[Chinese companies]{.underline}** -- most of which are state-owned --
**[have an increasingly strong presence in the global market for law
enforcement equipment.]{.underline}** China is the only country known to
manufacture spiked batons -- which have metal spikes along the entire
length of the baton or are plastic batons with a spiked metal head.
These are specifically designed as implements of torture and can cause
significant pain and suffering. Seven Chinese companies openly advertise
these inhumane sticks for export. Chinese-manufactured spiked batons
have reportedly been used by police in Cambodia and exported to security
forces in Nepal and Thailand. The research found 29 Chinese companies
involved in the export trade were advertising inherently cruel electric
stun batons. These devices make it easy for security officials to apply
extremely painful multiple shocks by hand to sensitive areas of the body
including the genitals, throat, groin or ears without long-lasting
physical traces. Scores of Chinese companies manufacture and trade
abusive restraint devices including heavy weighted leg cuffs and rigid
restraint chairs; one company manufactures neck combination cuffs. These
neck devices can endanger an individual's life by restricting breathing,
blood circulation and nerve communication between the body and the
brain. **[A review of several of the companies' marketing materials
reveals this equipment is being sold to various law enforcement agencies
across the world, including agencies that persistently abuse human
rights.]{.underline}**

**[On Monday, 24 September, the Alliance for Torture-Free Trade agreed
to step up the pace of its efforts and work towards a United Nations
instrument]{.underline}** **[- such as a binding convention - to stop
the trade in instruments for torture and the death
penalty]{.underline}**. The Alliance for Torture-Free Trade is an
initiative of the European Union, Argentina and Mongolia. **[In a
further boost to its work, the Alliance also saw a further five
countries joining, bringing the total to more than 60]{.underline}**. By
joining the Alliance**[, countries commit themselves to restricting
exports of these goods and to making it easier for customs authorities
to track down shipments]{.underline}** and identify new products.
Commissioner for Trade Cecilia Malmström, who co-hosted the Alliance\'s
first Ministerial meeting, held in the margins of the United Nations
General Assembly (UNGA) in New York said: \"**[Systematic use of torture
is a crime against humanity]{.underline}**. **[Today, we demonstrate our
commitment to human rights and taking concrete steps to eradicating
torture]{.underline}** and capital punishment. Torture is an instrument
of fear and has no place in any society. We\'ve come together with one
voice to say that we will not stand for this trade -- not in our
countries, or anywhere else in the world.\" The five additional
countries joining the Alliance for Torture-Free Trade at the Ministerial
were Australia, Cape Verde, New Zealand, Palau and Vanuatu. **[The
Alliance believes that UN instruments such as the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and the Arms Trade
treaty (ATT) provide working examples of international agreements to
stop unwanted trade]{.underline}**. **[Today\'s agreement]{.underline}**
to push for UN action marks a step forward in the process to **[create a
global framework for shutting down the trade in goods used to torture
people]{.underline}** or to carry out executions. **[The Alliance has in
its sights goods such as batons with metal spikes, electric shock belts,
grabbers that seize people while electrocuting them]{.underline}**,
chemicals used for executions, **[as well as gas chambers and electric
chairs.]{.underline}** Opened by United Nations High Commissioner for
Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, the Ministerial meeting saw
contributions from a range of Ministers and a series of international
experts, among them Secretary-General of Amnesty International Kumi
Naidoo. They testified to the horrors that are still carried out daily
with the panoply of goods manufactured and then bought and sold
internationally in a lucrative trade. In her opening speech, UN High
Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said torture had
directly affected her family. \"Torture is a grave attack on human
dignity,\" she said. \"It inflicts severe damage on both victims and
societies.\" **[In recent years, export bans on torture and execution
equipment - like the legislation in place in the EU - have made the
trade in these goods more difficult]{.underline}**. Such laws have not
ended it, however; **[traffickers find ways to circumvent bans and
controls through other countries.]{.underline}** This is why the
Alliance for Torture-Free Trade now aims to expand and take further
steps.

Strategic Trade Authorization License Exception In 2011, [the
Administration devised a new license exception known as the Strategic
Trade Authorization]{.underline} (STA), which is [designed to facilitate
transfers to low risk countries and to promote interoperability to
allies in the field]{.underline}.37 To be eligible, [exporters have to
provide notification to BIS of the transaction and a destination control
statement notifying the foreign consignee of the terms of the
exception\'s safeguard requirements]{.underline}, and they must obtain
from the foreign consignee a statement acknowledging its understanding
and willingness to comply with the requirements of the license
exception. Under the final rulemaking, [STA is available in various
degrees to 44 countries]{.underline}. To a group of 36 countries made up
of NATO partners and members of all 4 multilateral non-proliferation
control regimes, [dual-use items]{.underline} controlled for national
security (NS), chemical or biological weapons, nuclear
non-proliferation, regional stability, crime control, or significant
items (hot section jet technology) [are eligible for an STA. This
includes almost all items on the CCL that are not controlled for
statutory reasons.]{.underline} An additional eight countries are
eligible for exports, reexports, or transfers controlled for NS-only and
that are not designated as STA-excluded.38 [Dual-use items controlled
for missile technology (MT), chemical weapons (CW), short supply (SS),
or surreptitiously listening (SL) are not be eligible for export under
STA]{.underline}. [Certain implements of execution and
torture]{.underline}, pathogens and toxins, software and technology for
\"hot-sections\" of aero gas-turbine engines, and encryption [have also
been excluded from the STA]{.underline}. According to former
CommerceSecretary Locke, [the license exception will eliminate the need
for licenses for over 3,000 yearly types of transactions, affecting
\$1.4 billion in exports.]{.underline}39

#### International norms don't decrease torture

Norms Reduce Torture?," The Journal of Legal Studies , Vol. 38, No. 2,
pp. 465-466) // WhtCbn

**[The findings in this paper are a disappointment to anyone who
believes that an antitorture norm can reduce the state practice of
torture]{.underline}**. **[We could find no evidence]{.underline}** to
support that belief. **[The spreading of an international norm against
torture has,]{.underline}** according to our findings, **[not limited
the practice of torture to any extent]{.underline}**. Indeed,
**[reported practice worsened as the Convention against Torture gathered
more adherents]{.underline}**. Clearly there are issues with the
measures of torture that we used, as there are with any measure of human
rights practice. However, if the measures were fundamentally flawed, our
dictatorship variable should have performed equally badly to our norms
measure. It did not. Furthermore, we were able to bracket what the
effect of the norm on the increased reporting of torture would have to
be in order to account for our results, and we found that, to explain
our results, **[the effect of the norm on reporting would have to be
significantly larger than its effect on state practice.]{.underline}**
While disappointing, these results are perhaps not all that surprising
given earlier studies of the effects of human rights treaties on state
practice, notably, Hathaway (2002). **[If states' adherence to an
obvious legal commitment such as a treaty does not change its practice,
what hope is there that something as amorphous as a norm
will?]{.underline}** Still, behavior has changed with changing norms in
the past. The slave trade has been abolished and colonies are virtually
nonexistent, consistent with the development of strong prohibitory norms
against both of those practices. The question is, did the changing norm
cause the changing behavior or merely reflect it while behavior changed
for other reasons? One has to **[be very careful about conflating
behavioral norms and deontological norms]{.underline}**. On that very
point our results point to one inescapable conclusion: **[the
antitorture norm is a deontological norm, but it is not a behavioral
norm]{.underline}**.17 It is a fairly clear deontological norm because
**[over three-quarters of the countries in the world have legally bound
themselves to it]{.underline}** in some fashion. Indeed, the scope of
the deontological norm is such that even **[those who torture often
recognize the inappropriateness of their actions]{.underline}**.18 And
yet **[the antitorture norm is clearly not a behavioral norm because
violations of it are widespread]{.underline}**. In 2003, a year in which
more than three-quarters of the countries of the world were members of
the CAT, 69 percent of the countries in the word practiced some form of
torture according to Amnesty International reports. Our results suggest,
quite simply, that **[torture is a practice in which leaders engage even
though they know it is wrong]{.underline}**.

### 1NC -- Trade Turn

#### Restricting the torture sets a precedent that justifies protectionism

The representative of [Singapore]{.underline}, explaining her
delegation's position, said ["L.94" is fundamentally
flawed]{.underline}.  In terms of substance, [it asks the General
Assembly to legislate and regulate international trade]{.underline}.
 "[It is not the appropriate body to do so]{.underline}," she said. 
Moreover, only three informal consultations were held on the draft
resolution, during which many Member States expressed concern that the
text was being rushed.  In addition, ["L.94" seeks to establish new
conditions on international trade which could be used to justify
protectionism]{.underline}.  It is ironic that the co-sponsors have
always claimed to be advocates of a multilateral trading system, she
said, adding that [Singapore's "lifeblood" is international
trade]{.underline}.  However, it is inappropriate for the United Nations
to adopt this text.  With unilateralism on the rise, [the draft
establishes a precedent and emboldens others to put forth drafts that
legislate international trade]{.underline}.  Co-sponsors also link
capital punishment to torture, demonstrating that they are only
interested in pushing forward their ideologies.  For the abovementioned
reasons, she will vote against "L.94", urging others to do the same.

[Protectionism]{.underline} has also [been accused of being one of the
major causes of wars]{.underline}. The [constant warfare]{.underline}
[in the 17th and 18th centuries]{.underline} among European countries
[whose governments were]{.underline} predominantly mercantilist and
[protectionist;]{.underline} the American Revolution, which came about
primarily due to British tariffs and taxes; as well as the protective
policies preceding World War 1 and 2. According to Frederic Bastiat,
\"[When goods cannot cross borders, armies will]{.underline}.\" History
following this enunciation is not lacking example such as; in 1930,
facing only a mild recession, US [President Hoover]{.underline} ignored
warning pleas in a petition by 1028 prominent economists and signed the
notorious Smoot-Hawley Act, which [raised]{.underline} [some tariffs to
100% levels]{.underline}. [Within a year]{.underline}, over 25 other
[governments had retaliated]{.underline} by passing similar laws. What
was the result? [World trade came to a grinding halt, and the entire
world was plunged into the \"Great Depression]{.underline}\" for the
rest of the decade. [The depression in turn led to World War
II]{.underline}. An enhanced clarification is, when the government of
[Country \"A\" puts up trade barriers]{.underline} against the goods of
Country \"B\", the government of [Country \"B\" will]{.underline}
naturally [retaliate by erecting trade barriers]{.underline} against the
goods of Country \"A\". What was the result? [A trade war]{.underline}
in which [both sides lose]{.underline}. But all too often [a depressed
economy is not the only negative outcome of a trade war]{.underline} . .

Moreover, it is the [stated policy of most First World countries to
eliminate protectionism through free trade policies]{.underline}
enforced by international treaties and organizations such as the World
Trade Organization. [Despite this, many of these countries still place
protective and/or revenue tariffs on foreign products to
protect]{.underline} some favored or politically [influential
industries]{.underline}. This creates an artificially profitable
industry that [discourages foreign innovation]{.underline} from taking
place. Moreover, protectionist quotas can cause foreign producers to
become more profitable, mitigating their desired effect. This happens
because quotas artificially restrict supply, so it is unable to meet
demand; as a result the foreign producer can command a premium price for
its products. These increased profits are known as quota rents (CEE).
\[11\] My point of view, as a freshman economist is to try to understand
the degree in which countries have suffered or gained out of these two
principles. In spite of evidence of damage caused by trade restrictions,
pressure for more \"protectionist\" laws persists. Who is behind this,
and why? [Those who gain from \"protectionist\" laws are
special-interest groups, such as some big corporations, unions, and
farmers\' groups]{.underline} -- all of whom would like to get away with
charging higher prices and getting higher wages than they could expect
in a free marketplace. These special interests have the money and
political clout for influencing politicians to pass laws favorable to
them. Politicians in turn play on the fears of uninformed voters to
rally support for these laws. Who are therefore the losers in this
international game? YOU and all other ordinary consumers. Your
[freedom]{.underline} is being [trampled into the dust by these
laws]{.underline}, and you are literally being [robbed, through taxes
and higher prices, in order to line the pockets of a few
politically-privileged]{.underline} \"fat cats.\" This situation made it
clear to economist's mind that some are favored while others...also
\"[Protectionism is a misnomer]{.underline}. The only [people protected
by tariffs]{.underline}, quotas [and trade restrictions are those
engaged in uneconomic and wasteful activity]{.underline}. [Free trade is
the only philosophy compatible with international peace and
prosperity]{.underline}.\" by Walter Block \[12\] (Senior Economist,
Fraser Institute, Canada). Moreover, another great economist pointed out
the fact that, [the world enjoyed its greatest economic growth during
the relatively free trade period of 1945-1970, a period that also saw no
major wars]{.underline}. Yet we again see trade barriers being raised
around the world by short-sighted politicians. [Will the world again end
up in a shooting war as a result of these economically-deranged
policies]{.underline}? Can we afford to allow this to happen in the
nuclear age? Well, I think not really...because I suppose there is still
much to cover, for this better world we're all fighting for. Another
great economist pointed out the fact that, the economic war fought in
our world today is due to a huge variety of economic philosophy of
nationalism, as quoted below. \"[What generates war is the economic
philosophy of nationalism: embargoes, trade and foreign exchange
controls]{.underline}, monetary devaluation, etc. [The philosophy of
protectionism is a philosophy of war]{.underline}." Ludwig Von Mises
(Great Economist).

### 1NC -- EU key

#### EU key to eliminate arms trade

NGOs such as Amnesty were critical for generating the political will for
this ban by relentlessly campaigning for effective change and feeding
the media strong stories on how such equipment was actually used. Seven
years after the STOA report, the European Commission brought in the
Regulation No.1236/2005 **[concerning trade in goods which could be used
for capital punishment, torture and other ill treatment,]{.underline}**
which came into effect on 31 July 2006. The regulation was necessary but
not sufficient instrument to outlaw the trade. **[Amnesty identified a
series of loopholes including a failure to ban the import of such
technologies, a failure to outlaw]{.underline}** "transhipment" through
the EC, **[a failure to stop brokering and a failure to add a catchall
clause to extend control to all types of similar
equipment]{.underline}**. \[17\] A vital ingredient to rectifying these
glaring failures was the extraordinary comedian/activist Mark Thomas.
Mark energized a new generation of activists to take on the arms trade
and human rights violations through a series of hard hitting TV
programmes. He became more knowledgeable than most academics on the
minutiae and loopholes of the trade and helped forge powerful alliances
amongst human rights NGOs and research activists -- to the extent of
providing master classes on loopholes in UK law to Parliamentary Select
Committees. **[Mark said arms dealing]{.underline}** from the UK **[was
so easy and unregulated that children could easily set up as arms
brokers]{.underline}**. He proved his point by helping two schools in
Oxfordshire and Dublin do just that -- 'After School Arms Clubs'. **[The
kids were offered weapons, leg irons and even managed to buy and broker
electric shock devices and sting sticks]{.underline}**. Their
professional press briefings at the Irish and Westminster parliaments
helped to further tighten new controls on some of these loopholes, at
least in the UK. \[18\] **[There was certainly an urgent need to halt
the promotion of this type of equipment]{.underline}**. As the
regulation against torture and execution supplies was initiated in 2005,
I attended the 8th Janes Conference on Non-lethal Weapons at Leeds Royal
Armouries. The UK Department for Trade and Investment (DTI) were present
promoting British arms sales, but they also have a regulatory function.
When I spotted that **[one of the sponsors of the Janes' conference had
literature promoting electroshock technology]{.underline}**, inspired by
Mark, I asked the DTI staff to arrest the sponsors. Their stall was
quickly emptied of literature and feathers were ruffled but there were
no arrests. More recently, **[the Omega Foundation found catalogues at
the Milipol exhibition]{.underline}** in Paris in November 2015,
**[promoting]{.underline}** banned equipment such as **[thumb-cuffs,
spiked batons and weighted leg restraints]{.underline}**. Omega
reported: "**[A set of weighted leg irons and a spiked shield were
physically on display at this event]{.underline}**. As of 28 September,
the website of German company PKI Electronic Intelligence **[GmbH
continued to advertise banned 60,000 volt electric stun
hand-cuffs]{.underline}** with the chilling tagline "You never saw an
escaping person stop so quickly!" \[19\] Furthermore: "**[The global
market is rife with sinister equipment like leg chains and spiked batons
which can easily be turned into tools of torture]{.underline}**.
**[Introducing tighter EU restrictions on the sale, brokering and
promotion of these devices will bring us a step closer to eradicating
this shameful trade]{.underline}**," (Ara Marcen Naval, Advocate Advisor
for Arms Control, Security Trade and Human Rights at Amnesty
International)." \[20\] Extending European torture and execution free
zones Indeed, a network of NGOs including Amnesty, Omega and Reprieve
continued to successfully lobby for an effective closing of these
loopholes. \[21\] The European Commission responded in 2012 by
**[setting up an expert committee to]{.underline}** painstakingly
**[examine every form of security equipment which might be used to
violate human rights through torture]{.underline}** or execution. It was
a formidable task and the committee reported in 2013. The resolution
amending the earlier regulation was voted in by a huge majority of 612
in favour, 11 against, 54 abstentions. \[22\] **[The Regulation has
already had a direct impact on the trade and the global death count of
state executions, especially in the US where it has cut off supplies of
chemicals required for lethal injection]{.underline}**. Most recently
Pfizer joined the ban. \[23\] Closing the EU execution drugs supply
chain has already brought a halt to executions in many US States (where
some verdicts have been found to be racially biased or less than
evidence based). \[24\] **[Execution rates in the USA have now dropped
to their lowest level for 40 years]{.underline}**. \[25\]

**[Canada]{.underline}** recently **[apologized]{.underline}** **[and
gave \$10 million to a Canadian tortured by Americans]{.underline}**.
Meanwhile, **[the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[just
promoted someone who oversaw torture to the post of CIA
director]{.underline}**. The political contrast between the Canadian and
American approaches is jarring. **[The differences owe a lot to stronger
protections in Canadian law]{.underline}**. In 2002, Gina Haspel ran a
CIA black site in Thailand where at least one detainee was tortured with
waterboarding, which is a way to make someone feel like they are
drowning without killing them. In 2005, shortly after a Senate
investigation into torture began, **[Haspel executed]{.underline}** (and
reportedly advocated for) **[an order to destroy recordings of the
interrogations]{.underline}**. A dying John McCain urged his colleagues
to reject her nomination to become CIA director. He said: \"Ms.
Haspel\'s role in overseeing the use of torture by Americans is
disturbing. Her **[refusal to acknowledge torture\'s immorality is
disqualifying.\"]{.underline}** Despite McCain\'s call to conscience,
the U.S. Senate confirmed Haspel as CIA director, thereby ensuring the
CIA\'s record of impunity remains unblemished. **[Not a single CIA
officer has ever been held criminally liable for any of the systemic
torture practised]{.underline}** worldwide during the George W. Bush
era. This reflects the politicization of the prosecutorial function,
which skewed toward U.S. President Barack **[Obama\'s statements
that]{.underline}** \"**[I\'m more interested in looking forward than
looking backwards]{.underline}**.\" Nor was there ever a successful
civil suit against U.S. officials or the U.S. government. **[American
law provided]{.underline}** ample and **[effective shields to protect
torturers and the architects of torture policy]{.underline}**. Their
courts are highly deferential to Congress and the executive when it
comes to finding liability in the national security context and come
close to viewing such matters as nonreviewable political matters. One
after another, lawsuits were dismissed without proceeding to the macabre
merits. For example, Khalid El-Masri tried and failed to sue CIA
officials who assisted in his extraordinary rendition from Macedonia to
Afghanistan, where he was allegedly tortured. He was eventually released
on the grounds that his capture was a mistake. He later noted: \"it
seems **[the only place in the world where my case cannot be discussed
is in a U.S. courtroom]{.underline}**.\" In the end, **[no U.S. official
or institution was held accountable]{.underline}**, though it took
plenty of dirty hands for all that sweeping under a massive, rancid rug.
By contrast, **[the Canadian approach is more admirable]{.underline}**
in large part because of stronger laws that promote accountability. In
1985, the Supreme Court of Canada decided that **[it had an
\"obligation\" to review rights violations by the executive branch, even
if it involved sensitive national security matters]{.underline}**. It
rejected the U.S. \"political questions doctrine,\" which counsels the
kind of judicial deference which ultimately insulated the Bush
administration. Section 24(1) of the charter gives those whose rights
were violated a right to apply for an appropriate and just remedy.
**[The Canadian governments that have settled a number of
lawsuits]{.underline}** before and after the Omar Khadr case did so in
part because of concerns that those who had been tortured with Canadian
complicity might receive large damage awards from the courts. Last year,
ministers Freeland and Goodale apologized for Canada\'s role in Omar
Khadr\'s sordid and illegal treatment, and he received a bit more than
25 cents from every Canadian: 10 million taxpayer dollars in all. This
provides some accountability, if not justice. **[Institutions are more
likely to change their behaviour when mistakes are
costly]{.underline}**. One of us was involved in the early political
discussions about a possible settlement with Omar Khadr, when the
government faced the iron certainty of mounting legal costs in a losing
legal battle. What is perhaps most significant**[, in contrast to the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, **[is that the
government felt any real legal pressure at all]{.underline}**. Gina
Haspel is far from the only American complicit in torture, but **[a
Senate confirmation was one of the few available mechanisms in the
United States to hold anyone responsible]{.underline}**. To the extent
that Gina Haspel is a scapegoat for a more systematic evil, it is
because the **[American legal system catastrophically failed to demand
any further accountability.]{.underline}**

rule]{.underline}**, especially if they might be catastrophic.'215 Gross
makes the point, that '\[t\]o be a true moral absolutist, **[one must
support a ban on torture no matter what, that is, no matter how likely
the harm and no matter how great the magnitude of that
harm]{.underline}**.'216 However, when this principle is applied to real
life, '\[m\]any who support absolute, categorical rights... realize that
their position is untenable, not only practically but also morally
speaking, when applied to such catastrophic cases.'217 **[Fried, a
professed anti-utilitarian and human rights professor, suggests that
this is perhaps because they realise that 'it seems fanatical to
maintain the absoluteness of the judgement, to do right even if the
heavens will in fact fall]{.underline}**.'218 Here, Fried recognises
what might be referred to as a 'catastrophic exception' to any general
anti-torture argument.

#### **Consequentialism takes prioirty in the face of deontology in the face of large crises**

**[Moore, a self professed 'threshold deontologist', supports the notion
of catastrophic exceptions. He suggests that 'deontological norms govern
up to a point despite adverse consequences]{.underline}**; **[but when
the consequences become so dire that they cross the stipulated
threshold, consequentialism takes over']{.underline}**.219 Moore holds,
that **['consequentialist considerations can override deontological
judgements under the condition that extremely harmful outcomes are
inevitable consequences of enacting the alleged duty.]{.underline}**'220
That is to say, whilst torture is generally prohibited, when 'innocent
lives are at stake, torturing a terrorist is deontologically justified
and even morally required.'221 Cocks, a contributor to a draft of the
European Convention of Human Rights, declares that **['\[a\]ll forms of
torture, whether inflicted by policy, military authorities \[or\]
members of private organisations... are inconsistent with civilised
society]{.underline}**, are offences against heaven and humanity and
must be prohibited.'222 Cocks' moralistic ideal, is to a certain extent
accurate; torture is without a doubt 'inconsistent with society', and it
is certainly an 'offence against humanity', **[however this does not
automatically prohibit it in all circumstances]{.underline}**. Herein
lays the crux of the issue upon which moral absolutism is based; the
theory assumes that because something is wrong, it absolutely cannot be
done, but this is simply not the case. **[For example, it is possible to
give an account of the inherent wrongness of torture; it
'instrumentalizes the pain and terror of human beings; it involves the
deliberate, studied, and sustained imposition of pain to the point of
agony on a person who is utterly vulnerable... and it aims to use that
agony to shatter and mutilate the subject's will']{.underline}**.223
However, giving an account which shows that what is inherently wrong may
never in any circumstances be done is another. 'Inherently' does not
mean the same as 'absolutely'.224 **[Therefore, it is arguable that acts
classified as 'inherently wrong', may still be permissible in specific
situations.]{.underline}** Elshtain, a modern moral philosopher, asserts
that a refusal to approve the use of these techniques in the
aforementioned situations, amounts to 'a form of moral laziness,' 'a
moralistic code-fetishism,' or 'a legalistic version of pietistic
rigorism in which one's own moral purity is ranked above other
goods.'225 Elshtain paints a self-righteous and egotistical picture of
the absolutist position**[. This, however, is an unfair portrayal; the
absolutist position is dictated by law and convention. The international
legal instruments which forbid torture 'are public documents; they are
not treaties of personal ethics but conventions
establishing]{.underline}** minimum legal standards for the exercise of
state power. As such, they prohibit torture categorically and
absolutely'.226

#### Death can be justified then torture can be in some cases, torture is not inherently worse than death

**Steinhoff 13**

(Uwe, department of Philosophy at University of Hong Kong, PhD in
Würzburg, Research Associate in the Oxford Leverhulme Programme on the
Changing Character of War at the Department of Politics and
International Relations at Oxford University, "The Moral Justification
of Torture," Ethics of Torture Ch. 10, pp. 20-24) // WhtCbn

However, to avoid this problem, **[certain absolutist
opponents]{.underline}** of torture **[insist that being
tortured]{.underline}** (or even having been tortured) **[is in fact
worse than death]{.underline}**. Such **[a claim]{.underline}**, of
course, **[flies in the face of reason and common sense]{.underline}**.
Nevertheless, let us have a look at how those absolutist opponents of
torture try to back it up. The last chapter of Bob Brecher's book on
torture is entitled "Torture, Death, and Philosophy." He states: I shall
argue that torture breaks people; and that "purely" interrogational
torture, something that "leaves no lasting damage," is thus yet another
fantasy. To allow torture at all, therefore---whether or not legally
normalized, would be grotesque.10 What is actually grotesque here is the
"therefore" in this quote. Blowing out somebody's brain in
**[self-defense]{.underline}** also leaves lasting damage; it **[lasts
for eternity]{.underline}**. Nevertheless, **[it is still entirely
justifiable as a necessary]{.underline}** and proportionate **[means to
save an innocent life from the attack of an aggressor]{.underline}**.
The same holds for cutting off somebody's hand, gouging out somebody's
eye, severely burning somebody's skin with a flamethrower, and many
other forms of severely injuring an aggressor in proportionate and
necessary self-defense. Besides, **[Brecher adduces no evidence that all
forms of torture leave lasting damage; he just insists it
does]{.underline}**. As regards the "breaking" of people, Brecher
states: "**[The tortured person's capacity to act is
broken]{.underline}**."11 **[Yet]{.underline}**, this is of course
simply wrong. **[A dead person's capacity to act is
broken]{.underline}**, that much is certain, and a person who has been
knocked out in self-defense is likewise incapable of acting as long as
she is unconscious---but **[interrogational torture that undermined the
tortured person's ability to act would obviously be
counterproductive]{.underline}**. After all, one wants, one needs the
person to act: namely to commit the act of disclosing the required
information.12 Disclosing it is an act, and omitting to disclose it is
also an act. And after having been tortured**[, tortured people can do
all kinds of things]{.underline}**, for example going into a bar, having
a chat with friends, and drinking beer. **[Dead people
can't]{.underline}**. **[They can only rot, but that is not an
act]{.underline}**. Brecher also makes the following statement: "For
some people death is preferable to torture, not just while being
tortured, but afterwards too."13 That The Moral Justification of Torture
21 is true, but it is also irrelevant. After all, for some people death
might also be preferable to being publicly outed as homosexual. That
proves neither that killing is always better than publicly outing
someone as a homosexual, nor that outing someone as a homosexual is
always unjustified. Brecher criticizes Seumas Miller, who, like me,
thinks that some forms of torture are preferable to death. Brecher
claims: **[Miller forgets to tell us whether his assessment of what is
preferable relates to the situation before torture begins or after it is
over]{.underline}**. **[If it is a matter of a person's preference
before the torture starts, then they might well
prefer]{.underline}**---or judge---**[death to be better than the risk
of one's will being broken and/or of one's life being irretrievably
shattered]{.underline}**. **[If the preference Miller has in mind is one
expressed once the torture is over, then it is quite possible that
neither preference nor judgement are any longer relevant]{.underline}**.
For these are components of a normal human life, not of an entirely
shattered one. **[The inability in any everyday sense to prefer one
thing to another]{.underline}**, and/**[or to make everyday judgments,
is precisely part of what it is for one's life to have been utterly
shattered]{.underline}**.14 First of all, if the "inability in any
everyday sense to prefer one thing to another, and/or to make everyday
judgments, is precisely part of what it is for one's life to have been
utterly shattered," **[then very few torture victims' lives have been
utterly shattered]{.underline}**. Many torture victims are quite able to
prefer, in an everyday sense, chocolate ice cream to vanilla ice cream
or vice versa. Some people subjected to entirely justified nontorturous
self-defense, however, are not, because **[the self-defensive measures
taken inflicted far too much brain damage on them]{.underline}**. Thus,
what in Brecher's view is "quite possible" is also highly unlikely; thus
**[the preferences after the torture are not irrelevant]{.underline}**.
As regards Brecher's remarks about the preference for death before
torture, they only show that he does not quite understand the position
of his opponents. This lack of understanding is also revealed when he
talks about "the assumption they make about torture being just obviously
preferable to death."15 No one who defends torture under certain
circumstances makes any such assumption. **[Some of them only make the
assumption that some forms of torture are obviously preferable to
death]{.underline}**. That assumption is certainly correct, and nothing
Brecher says comes even near to refuting it. J. Jeremy Wisnewski and R.
D. Emerick, in their attempt to show that torture is worse than death,
do not fare better than Brecher. For instance, they claim that it "is in
torture's very nature to be capable of being worse than 22 On the Ethics
of Torture death."16 This is as true and as irrelevant as Brecher's
statement that some people prefer death to torture. **[It
is]{.underline}**, after all, also **[in death's very nature to be
capable of being worse than some torture]{.underline}**. They also claim
that "torture is inherently destructive of agency, and hence always
impermissible."17 I have already dealt with this claim in criticizing
Brecher's mistaken assertion that "\[t\]he tortured person's capacity to
act is broken."18 There is nothing to add. This is also true for their
claim, taken from Paul Améry, that "\[w\]hoever was tortured, stays
tortured."19 Whoever was killed, stays killed. Whoever was mutilated,
stays mutilated. Whoever was deflowered, stays deflowered. **[None of
this shows that they were unjustifiably tortured, killed,
mutilated,]{.underline}** or deflowered. In a certain way Wisnewski and
Emerick go even further than Brecher. They claim: **[The question that
must be posed is . . . not what is to be preferred, torture or death;
the question, more honestly, is as follows: what is to be preferred, an
immediate death or torture]{.underline}**, **[followed by the agonizing
life of one who has been tortured]{.underline}**?20 I find **[this
question somewhat dishonest.]{.underline}** This dishonesty is also
displayed in the fact that Wisnewski and Emerick accuse others of a
"seeming disregard paid to the actual literature,"21 while their attempt
to use it in support of their claim that torture is worse than death
suggests that they do not really care about the actual findings of that
literature. For instance, they quote Conroy saying: **[When
Doctors]{.underline}** Finn **[Somnier]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** Inge **[Genefke]{.underline}**
**[examined]{.underline}** twentyfour **[torture survivors an average of
9.5 years after their torture]{.underline}** (see "Psychotherapy for
Victims of Torture," British Journal of Psychiatry, 1986, vol. 149),
they found 71 percent had impaired memory, 75 percent had impaired
concentration, 75 percent experienced fatigue, 50 percent suffered from
persistent fear and anxiety, 38 percent experienced vertigo, 21 percent
reported sexual problems, and 13 tremors or shaking.22 And they add
three sentences later: As is obvious, **[the mental and physical state
of one who has been tortured has significant implications for
inter-personal relationships]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** hence
**[on one's ability to function in social]{.underline}** and familial
**[settings]{.underline}**. This is often enough to wrench the last
meaningful interactions from the lives of the broken. All that is left
to do, it seems, is die. The Moral Justification of Torture 23 At least
it is somewhat refreshing that Wisnewski and Emerick are consistent
enough to inform certain torture victims who are reading their book that
death is the best these readers can hope for and that they are no
autonomous agents anyway.23 However, how that squares with their
professed concern about human dignity, I do not know. Anyway, not only
"the mental and physical state of one who has been tortured has
significant implications for inter-personal relationships"; obviously
the mental and physical state of persons generally, tortured or not, has
such implications. Besides, if "the mental and physical state of one who
has been tortured" wrenches "the last meaningful interactions from the
lives of the broken" only "often enough," **[then it does not always
wrench it from the lives of those who have been broken by torture, let
alone from those torture did not manage to break]{.underline}**. That is
not surprising. For if you apply the method of subtraction to the Conroy
quote Wisnewski and Emerick offer, you come to the following result:
When Doctors Finn Somnier and Inge Genefke examined twentyfour torture
survivors an average of 9.5 years after their torture (see
"Psychotherapy for Victims of Torture," British Journal of Psychiatry,
1986, vol. 149), they found 29 percent did not have impaired memory, 25
percent did not have impaired concentration, 25 percent did not
experience fatigue, 50 percent did not suffer from persistent fear and
anxiety, 62 percent did not experience vertigo, 79 percent did not
report sexual problems, and 87 did not report tremors or shaking. **[In
contrast to this]{.underline}**, empirical studies show that not 20, not
30, not 98, but **[100 percent of those who have been killed are
dead.]{.underline}** And **[the mental and physical state of being dead
does not just "wrench the last meaningful interactions" from the dead
"often enough"; it does so always and permanently.]{.underline}** Maybe
I am being pedantic, but to me it seems that **[this is a very
significant difference between death and some forms of
torture]{.underline}**. Wisnewski and Emerick also offer the following
quote, this time from Sussman: \[U\]nlike other kinds of unwanted
imposition, **[pain characteristically compromises or undermines the
very capacities constitutive of autonomous agency itself]{.underline}**.
**[It is almost impossible to reflect, deliberate, or even think
straight when one is in agony]{.underline}**. When sufficiently intense,
**[pain becomes a person's entire universe and his entire
self]{.underline}**, crowding out every other aspect of his mental life.
Unlike other 24 On the Ethics of Torture harms, pain takes its victim's
agency apart "from the inside," such that the agent may never be able to
reconstitute himself fully.24 And they add: **[This is
sufficient]{.underline}**, it seems, **[to demonstrate that death is not
the greater of two harms]{.underline}**. In fact, **[quite the
contrary]{.underline}**.25 Before drawing such a conclusion, Wisnewski
and Emerick should perhaps first have compared torture with death. Let
us do this now: Unlike other kinds of unwanted imposition,
**[death]{.underline}** not only "characteristically," but absolutely
**[always compromises or undermines the very capacities constitutive of
autonomous agency itself]{.underline}**. It is not only almost, but
absolutely always impossible to reflect, deliberate, or even think
straight when one is dead. Not only when "sufficiently intense,"
whatever that means, but absolutely always **[death destroys a person's
entire universe and his entire self once and for all, destroying his
mental life completely]{.underline}**. Unlike other harms, **[death
destroys a victim's agency once and for all]{.underline}**, such that
the agent not only "may" never be able to reconstitute himself fully, he
is definitely unable to reconstitute himself at all. This is sufficient,
it seems, to demonstrate that not all forms of torture are a greater
harm than death. In fact, quite the contrary.

#### Util only allows torture for the greater good, no other cases mean it's justified

(Moran, a Senior Fellow at the University of Haifa\'s Center for Cyber,

Walzer is highly skeptical of utilitarianism's---whether it is
act-utilitarianism or ruleutilitarianism---ability to contain the notion
of "dirty hands" (1973: 168--173). **[Util]{.underline}**itarianism,
says Walzer, "**[captures some of the reasons for moral
taboos]{.underline}**," **[but]{.underline}** "**[fails utterly to
explain their power]{.underline}**" (2004: 36). This is why, on his
view, "dirty hands" is exclusively an "absolutist predicament" (Meisels
2008: 155). Meisels argues against this assumption, suggesting that "the
'dirty hands' thesis is actually more widely applicable and illuminates
a greater range of moral positions on issues such as torture than Walzer
himself assumes" (Ibid). She criticizes Walzer for **[his view of
rule-utilitarianism as "merely convenient rules of thumb," summaries of
previous calculations, and asserts that rule-utilitarianism "contains
rules with greater normative force, which derives from the usefulness of
the rules themselves]{.underline}**" (Ibid: 156--157).6 On this view, if
**[the use of torture is generally detrimental to the greater happiness,
a rule-utilitarian would be committed, perhaps as strongly as an
absolutist, to refraining from it]{.underline}**, **[regardless of its
immediate benefits;]{.underline}** by a rule-utilitarian's moral
standards, **[the use of torture would be a breach of a prohibition far
weightier than simply a breach of some rule of thumb]{.underline}**
(Ibid: 156--159). In fact, says Meisels, such a **[rule-utilitarian
could "certainly be said to have dirtied his hands considerably by doing
so \[using torture]{.underline}**\]" (Ibid: 156). I believe **[Meisels
is right in exposing Walzer's somewhat simplistic account of
ruleutilitarianism]{.underline}**. Thus, it is true that Walzer
underestimates the normative force attached by ruleutilitarianism to
rules and the system of rules in themselves**[, a force which transcends
the shortterm benefits any specific rule might entail]{.underline}**.
Still, I find Meisels' overall conclusion on the issue of
rule-utilitarianism and "dirty hands" to be mistaken. For the purpose of
the argument set henceforth I assume the existence of "pure"
rule-utilitarians, i.e. moral agents who are totally free of
deontological constraints and therefore base their moral position solely
on utilitarian calculations. As implied earlier, I highly doubt that
such moral agents actually exist and, as a matter of fact, Meisels'
repeated referrals to Nagel's idea of mixed moral intuitions seem to
point towards a similar position (Ibid: 154--155, 158). However, it is
Meisles' still-standing argument that the problem of "dirty hands" plays
out "within rule-utilitarianism" (Ibid: 155), which I will now refute.
**[A general prohibition on torture may be justified on
rule-utilitarian]{.underline}** (rule-consequentialist) grounds.7 A
complex, policy-oriented, calculation of the overall balance of
utilities entailed by the use, or non-use, of torture may lead the
rule-utilitarian to object to torture, under circumstances in which
**[an act-utilitarian would most probably support its use]{.underline}**
(Moore 1989: 295). Since **[the use of torture, even if beneficial when
judged on immediate terms, has "definite detrimental effects on any
society's general happiness]{.underline}**" (Meisels 2008: 157), a
rule-utilitarian-based prohibition on the use of torture **[may come
close in its force and scope to an absolute moral prohibition on
torture]{.underline}**. From that long-term-utility-based perspective,
**[a rule-utilitarian may undoubtedly hold a very strong moral objection
to torture of any kind]{.underline}**. However, **[a moral prohibition
on torture]{.underline}**, which is based on rule-utilitarian grounds,
**[can only approximate an absolutist position]{.underline}**; it can
never really be absolutist and at the same time stay totally faithful to
its own consequentialist terms (Gross 2004: 1497; Moore 1989: 296).
**[Once a rule-utilitarian has decided that despite]{.underline}** all
weighty **[considerations]{.underline}** **[to the
contrary]{.underline}**, **[the use of torture]{.underline}** in a
particular, extreme, case, **[is nonetheless the right thing to do, this
must be because of an exception]{.underline}**---rare as it might
be---**[that exits to the general utilitarian rule against
torture]{.underline}**.8 For **[if a pure
rule-utilitaria]{.underline}**n, despite her powerful moral presumption
against torture, **[allows the use of torture in a particular case, this
must be because the utility of opting to torture in that particular case
outweighs]{.underline}**, all things considered, the utilities
underlying the general rule, which means, from a utilitarian
perspective, that **[using torture in that particular case is what one
ought to do; it is the moral thing to do]{.underline}**. Any other
instance in which torture is used, should be considered, from a
rule-utilitarian perspective as wrong, that is immoral.

#### Util is correct even with torture, small sacrifices for greater good allows less evil

Let me finally point to the utterly counterintuitive, indeed absurd
implications of the view that all forms of torture are worse than death
for third-party action. **[Surgeons]{.underline}** sometimes **[amputate
limbs of unconscious patients in order to save their
lives]{.underline}**. **[They do this on the very reasonable assumption
that those patients would prefer life without a hand or a leg to no life
at all.]{.underline}** And if the patients do not, they still have the
option to kill themselves afterwards. In the same vein, it seems to be
justified to cut off someone's hand in the following situation: **[the
victim's fingers have gotten caught in a machine]{.underline}** **[that
will slowly pull her in]{.underline}** and crush her. **[A third person
passes by]{.underline}**. **[The victim is]{.underline}** screaming in
pain, **[unable]{.underline}** **[to communicate]{.underline}** and thus
to **[consent]{.underline}** to any action of another person. **[The
only way to save the person's life is to cut off her hand with the
axe]{.underline}** the passerby has. **[It seems that he is entirely
justified in doing just that]{.underline}**. **[Cutting off the victim's
hand is the lesser evil]{.underline}**. **[It is for the victim's own
good]{.underline}**. In fact, all else being equal, the following seems
to be true: **[if you can see to it that the smaller of two possible
harms befalls a victim, you are justified in inflicting the smaller one
if this is the only way to prevent the bigger one]{.underline}**. Now
consider the following case: an innocent victim is about to be
waterboarded for half an hour by some torturers (perhaps even by
state-sanctioned state agents for interrogational purposes---if that
should matter). Someone else comes along, and the only way she could
possibly prevent the victim from being tortured is to shoot the victim.
If one really thinks that all forms of torture are worse than death, it
is unclear how absolutist torture opponents---unwarranted ad hoc claims
aside---can avoid the conclusion that it is justifiable to kill the
victim in this situation. I take this to be a reductio ad absurdum of
the view that all forms of torture are worse than killing. Clearly, the
absolutist torture opponent who, full well knowing that the victim will
only be waterboarded for half an hour, kills him anyway to spare him a
fate allegedly "worse than death" is quite simply morally insane.

### 2NC -- Framing

#### Torture can be justified if the person have given up natural rights by harm and has information

Moving away from the timed threat scenarios, we can now briefly turn to
sketch a potential application of the foregoing arguments to the more
general interrogations of actors involved with terrorist threats.
Because **[a state of perpetual threat to the innocent persists, the
terrorist actors have forfeited their rights and may be
killed.]{.underline}** It follows that their rights to liberty, health,
and preservation of limb are likewise forfeit.22 22. **[It does not
immediately follow that this principle applies to all captured
persons]{.underline}** -- soldiers -- during wartime. Soldiers act as
surrogates for their states, and as such, enjoy some protections agreed
to by states in convention, so long as those soldiers and those states
abide by the convention. But **[an enemy soldier who plants a nuclear
device in a city and is captured may also be justifiably
tortured]{.underline}**. The threat to innocents converts him to a
terrorist. View all notes Thus, if pain infliction is useful in defusing
the more general terrorist "bomb,"23 23. It might seem that **[extending
the justification for torture in specific cases of self-defense to the
more general case of national self-defense against terrorism is
problematic.]{.underline}** But since terrorists by definition are
intending, planning, and carrying out lethal attacks against innocent
people, and since **[nation-states represent the self-defense rights of
their people, the inference to the general case is
justified]{.underline}**. What is less clear is the degree to which
torture can be used to ferret out information about entirely unknown
attacks, given the idealized conditions of knowledge in the ticking-bomb
scenario. But my argument shows that **[once rights-forfeiture has
occurred, the only real limit on interrogative pain-infliction would be
the principle of gratuity, namely that pain-infliction should be
employed for real interrogative purposes.]{.underline}** Thus,
**[employing torture on rights-forfeited persons already known to
possess information relevant to national self-defense for the purposes
of acquiring additional information is justified]{.underline}**. I
acknowledge that this creates an epistemic problem where torture may be
legitimated in cases where the victim no longer knows anything useful.
**[But the torture only becomes gratuitous once the torturers have good
reason to believe that their victim knows nothing else]{.underline}**.
However, if, as Rodriguez (2012 Rodriguez, Jose A. 2012. Hard Measures.
New York: Threshold Editions. \[Google Scholar\] ) suggests,
**[additional physical coercion becomes unnecessary once compliance is
reached]{.underline}**, then the point may be moot. View all notes
namely their aggressive plans of attack against innocent people, then
the innocent parties' self-defense rights kick in against the
terrorists. When "high value targets" are captured, and when they are
known to possess information vital to counter-terrorism efforts,
**[there is no moral limit to the amount and kinds of force that may be
employed to extract information necessary to safeguard the lives and
liberties of one's citizens]{.underline}**. Ethical limits on
interrogative torture come into play when we look at threatening a
terrorist's innocent family, a question of targeting, or when we capture
a person whose role remains unclear, a question of identification.
**[Torture may not be used on people known to be innocent simply because
they are valued by the bomb-planters]{.underline}**. Similarly,
**[torture may not be used to extract confessions of capital
offenses]{.underline}**, since that torture requires a warrant of
forfeiture for its justification.24 24. Recall the previous notes that
distinguished confession extraction from information gathering. Also
note that **[in cases where the tortured person is already known to have
committed relevant capital offenses, the use of torture to extract
additional confessions may be justified]{.underline}**. But where we
have in our grasp **[a person known to have forfeited his natural
rights]{.underline}** to life, liberty, limb, and property, **[and where
that person possesses information critical to safeguarding the lives of
innocent]{.underline}** people in our care, in such cases **[the only
ethical limit]{.underline}** on permissible coercion **[is the principle
of non-gratuitous harm]{.underline}**. Any coercion targeted on that
person necessary to safeguard the protected parties is permissible.
**[If it is permissible to kill a man in self-defense]{.underline}**,
**[then why would it be impermissible merely to harm him]{.underline}**?

view, "dirty hands" is exclusively an "absolutist predicament" (Meisels
2008: 155). Meisels argues against this assumption, suggesting that "the
'dirty hands' thesis is actually more widely applicable and illuminates
a greater range of moral positions on issues such as torture than Walzer
himself assumes" (Ibid). She criticizes Walzer for **[his view of
rule-utilitarianism as "merely convenient rules of thumb," summaries of
previous calculations, and asserts that rule-utilitarianism "contains
rules with greater normative force, which derives from the usefulness of
the rules themselves]{.underline}**" (Ibid: 156--157).6 On this view, if
**[the use of torture is generally detrimental to the greater happiness,
a rule-utilitarian would be committed, perhaps as strongly as an
absolutist, to refraining from it]{.underline}**, **[regardless of its
immediate benefits;]{.underline}** by a rule-utilitarian's moral
standards, **[the use of torture would be a breach of a prohibition far
weightier than simply a breach of some rule of thumb]{.underline}**
(Ibid: 156--159). In fact, says Meisels, such a **[rule-utilitarian
could "certainly be said to have dirtied his hands considerably by doing
so \[using torture]{.underline}**\]" (Ibid: 156). I believe **[Meisels
is right in exposing Walzer's somewhat simplistic account of
ruleutilitarianism]{.underline}**. Thus, it is true that Walzer
underestimates the normative force attached by ruleutilitarianism to
rules and the system of rules in themselves**[, a force which transcends
the shortterm benefits any specific rule might entail]{.underline}**.
Still, I find Meisels' overall conclusion on the issue of
rule-utilitarianism and "dirty hands" to be mistaken. For the purpose of
the argument set henceforth I assume the existence of "pure"
rule-utilitarians, i.e. moral agents who are totally free of
deontological constraints and therefore base their moral position solely
on utilitarian calculations. As implied earlier, I highly doubt that
such moral agents actually exist and, as a matter of fact, Meisels'
repeated referrals to Nagel's idea of mixed moral intuitions seem to
point towards a similar position (Ibid: 154--155, 158). However, it is
Meisles' still-standing argument that the problem of "dirty hands" plays
out "within rule-utilitarianism" (Ibid: 155), which I will now refute.
**[A general prohibition on torture may be justified on
rule-utilitarian]{.underline}** (rule-consequentialist) grounds.7 A
complex, policy-oriented, calculation of the overall balance of
utilities entailed by the use, or non-use, of torture may lead the
rule-utilitarian to object to torture, under circumstances in which
**[an act-utilitarian would most probably support its use]{.underline}**
(Moore 1989: 295). Since **[the use of torture, even if beneficial when
judged on immediate terms, has "definite detrimental effects on any
society's general happiness]{.underline}**" (Meisels 2008: 157), a
rule-utilitarian-based prohibition on the use of torture **[may come
close in its force and scope to an absolute moral prohibition on
torture]{.underline}**. From that long-term-utility-based perspective,
**[a rule-utilitarian may undoubtedly hold a very strong moral objection
to torture of any kind]{.underline}**. However, **[a moral prohibition
on torture]{.underline}**, which is based on rule-utilitarian grounds,
**[can only approximate an absolutist position]{.underline}**; it can
never really be absolutist and at the same time stay totally faithful to
its own consequentialist terms (Gross 2004: 1497; Moore 1989: 296).
**[Once a rule-utilitarian has decided that despite]{.underline}** all
weighty **[considerations]{.underline}** **[to the
contrary]{.underline}**, **[the use of torture]{.underline}** in a
particular, extreme, case, **[is nonetheless the right thing to do, this
must be because of an exception]{.underline}**---rare as it might
be---**[that exits to the general utilitarian rule against
torture]{.underline}**.8 For **[if a pure
rule-utilitaria]{.underline}**n, despite her powerful moral presumption
against torture, **[allows the use of torture in a particular case, this
must be because the utility of opting to torture in that particular case
outweighs]{.underline}**, all things considered, the utilities
underlying the general rule, which means, from a utilitarian
perspective, that **[using torture in that particular case is what one
ought to do; it is the moral thing to do]{.underline}**. Any other
instance in which torture is used, should be considered, from a
rule-utilitarian perspective as wrong, that is immoral.

### Torture Justified

#### Death can be justified then torture can be in some cases, torture is not inherently worse than death

**Steinhoff 13**

(Uwe, department of Philosophy at University of Hong Kong, PhD in
Würzburg, Research Associate in the Oxford Leverhulme Programme on the
Changing Character of War at the Department of Politics and
International Relations at Oxford University, "The Moral Justification
of Torture," Ethics of Torture Ch. 10, pp. 20-24) // WhtCbn

However, to avoid this problem, **[certain absolutist
opponents]{.underline}** of torture **[insist that being
tortured]{.underline}** (or even having been tortured) **[is in fact
worse than death]{.underline}**. Such **[a claim]{.underline}**, of
course, **[flies in the face of reason and common sense]{.underline}**.
Nevertheless, let us have a look at how those absolutist opponents of
torture try to back it up. The last chapter of Bob Brecher's book on
torture is entitled "Torture, Death, and Philosophy." He states: I shall
argue that torture breaks people; and that "purely" interrogational
torture, something that "leaves no lasting damage," is thus yet another
fantasy. To allow torture at all, therefore---whether or not legally
normalized, would be grotesque.10 What is actually grotesque here is the
"therefore" in this quote. Blowing out somebody's brain in
**[self-defense]{.underline}** also leaves lasting damage; it **[lasts
for eternity]{.underline}**. Nevertheless, **[it is still entirely
justifiable as a necessary]{.underline}** and proportionate **[means to
save an innocent life from the attack of an aggressor]{.underline}**.
The same holds for cutting off somebody's hand, gouging out somebody's
eye, severely burning somebody's skin with a flamethrower, and many
other forms of severely injuring an aggressor in proportionate and
necessary self-defense. Besides, **[Brecher adduces no evidence that all
forms of torture leave lasting damage; he just insists it
does]{.underline}**. As regards the "breaking" of people, Brecher
states: "**[The tortured person's capacity to act is
broken]{.underline}**."11 **[Yet]{.underline}**, this is of course
simply wrong. **[A dead person's capacity to act is
broken]{.underline}**, that much is certain, and a person who has been
knocked out in self-defense is likewise incapable of acting as long as
she is unconscious---but **[interrogational torture that undermined the
tortured person's ability to act would obviously be
counterproductive]{.underline}**. After all, one wants, one needs the
person to act: namely to commit the act of disclosing the required
information.12 Disclosing it is an act, and omitting to disclose it is
also an act. And after having been tortured**[, tortured people can do
all kinds of things]{.underline}**, for example going into a bar, having
a chat with friends, and drinking beer. **[Dead people
can't]{.underline}**. **[They can only rot, but that is not an
act]{.underline}**. Brecher also makes the following statement: "For
some people death is preferable to torture, not just while being
tortured, but afterwards too."13 That The Moral Justification of Torture
21 is true, but it is also irrelevant. After all, for some people death
might also be preferable to being publicly outed as homosexual. That
proves neither that killing is always better than publicly outing
someone as a homosexual, nor that outing someone as a homosexual is
always unjustified. Brecher criticizes Seumas Miller, who, like me,
thinks that some forms of torture are preferable to death. Brecher
claims: **[Miller forgets to tell us whether his assessment of what is
preferable relates to the situation before torture begins or after it is
over]{.underline}**. **[If it is a matter of a person's preference
before the torture starts, then they might well
prefer]{.underline}**---or judge---**[death to be better than the risk
of one's will being broken and/or of one's life being irretrievably
shattered]{.underline}**. **[If the preference Miller has in mind is one
expressed once the torture is over, then it is quite possible that
neither preference nor judgement are any longer relevant]{.underline}**.
For these are components of a normal human life, not of an entirely
shattered one. **[The inability in any everyday sense to prefer one
thing to another]{.underline}**, and/**[or to make everyday judgments,
is precisely part of what it is for one's life to have been utterly
shattered]{.underline}**.14 First of all, if the "inability in any
everyday sense to prefer one thing to another, and/or to make everyday
judgments, is precisely part of what it is for one's life to have been
utterly shattered," **[then very few torture victims' lives have been
utterly shattered]{.underline}**. Many torture victims are quite able to
prefer, in an everyday sense, chocolate ice cream to vanilla ice cream
or vice versa. Some people subjected to entirely justified nontorturous
self-defense, however, are not, because **[the self-defensive measures
taken inflicted far too much brain damage on them]{.underline}**. Thus,
what in Brecher's view is "quite possible" is also highly unlikely; thus
**[the preferences after the torture are not irrelevant]{.underline}**.
As regards Brecher's remarks about the preference for death before
torture, they only show that he does not quite understand the position
of his opponents. This lack of understanding is also revealed when he
talks about "the assumption they make about torture being just obviously
preferable to death."15 No one who defends torture under certain
circumstances makes any such assumption. **[Some of them only make the
assumption that some forms of torture are obviously preferable to
death]{.underline}**. That assumption is certainly correct, and nothing
Brecher says comes even near to refuting it. J. Jeremy Wisnewski and R.
D. Emerick, in their attempt to show that torture is worse than death,
do not fare better than Brecher. For instance, they claim that it "is in
torture's very nature to be capable of being worse than 22 On the Ethics
of Torture death."16 This is as true and as irrelevant as Brecher's
statement that some people prefer death to torture. **[It
is]{.underline}**, after all, also **[in death's very nature to be
capable of being worse than some torture]{.underline}**. They also claim
that "torture is inherently destructive of agency, and hence always
impermissible."17 I have already dealt with this claim in criticizing
Brecher's mistaken assertion that "\[t\]he tortured person's capacity to
act is broken."18 There is nothing to add. This is also true for their
claim, taken from Paul Améry, that "\[w\]hoever was tortured, stays
tortured."19 Whoever was killed, stays killed. Whoever was mutilated,
stays mutilated. Whoever was deflowered, stays deflowered. **[None of
this shows that they were unjustifiably tortured, killed,
mutilated,]{.underline}** or deflowered. In a certain way Wisnewski and
Emerick go even further than Brecher. They claim: **[The question that
must be posed is . . . not what is to be preferred, torture or death;
the question, more honestly, is as follows: what is to be preferred, an
immediate death or torture]{.underline}**, **[followed by the agonizing
life of one who has been tortured]{.underline}**?20 I find **[this
question somewhat dishonest.]{.underline}** This dishonesty is also
displayed in the fact that Wisnewski and Emerick accuse others of a
"seeming disregard paid to the actual literature,"21 while their attempt
to use it in support of their claim that torture is worse than death
suggests that they do not really care about the actual findings of that
literature. For instance, they quote Conroy saying: **[When
Doctors]{.underline}** Finn **[Somnier]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** Inge **[Genefke]{.underline}**
**[examined]{.underline}** twentyfour **[torture survivors an average of
9.5 years after their torture]{.underline}** (see "Psychotherapy for
Victims of Torture," British Journal of Psychiatry, 1986, vol. 149),
they found 71 percent had impaired memory, 75 percent had impaired
concentration, 75 percent experienced fatigue, 50 percent suffered from
persistent fear and anxiety, 38 percent experienced vertigo, 21 percent
reported sexual problems, and 13 tremors or shaking.22 And they add
three sentences later: As is obvious, **[the mental and physical state
of one who has been tortured has significant implications for
inter-personal relationships]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** hence
**[on one's ability to function in social]{.underline}** and familial
**[settings]{.underline}**. This is often enough to wrench the last
meaningful interactions from the lives of the broken. All that is left
to do, it seems, is die. The Moral Justification of Torture 23 At least
it is somewhat refreshing that Wisnewski and Emerick are consistent
enough to inform certain torture victims who are reading their book that
death is the best these readers can hope for and that they are no
autonomous agents anyway.23 However, how that squares with their
professed concern about human dignity, I do not know. Anyway, not only
"the mental and physical state of one who has been tortured has
significant implications for inter-personal relationships"; obviously
the mental and physical state of persons generally, tortured or not, has
such implications. Besides, if "the mental and physical state of one who
has been tortured" wrenches "the last meaningful interactions from the
lives of the broken" only "often enough," **[then it does not always
wrench it from the lives of those who have been broken by torture, let
alone from those torture did not manage to break]{.underline}**. That is
not surprising. For if you apply the method of subtraction to the Conroy
quote Wisnewski and Emerick offer, you come to the following result:
When Doctors Finn Somnier and Inge Genefke examined twentyfour torture
survivors an average of 9.5 years after their torture (see
"Psychotherapy for Victims of Torture," British Journal of Psychiatry,
1986, vol. 149), they found 29 percent did not have impaired memory, 25
percent did not have impaired concentration, 25 percent did not
experience fatigue, 50 percent did not suffer from persistent fear and
anxiety, 62 percent did not experience vertigo, 79 percent did not
report sexual problems, and 87 did not report tremors or shaking. **[In
contrast to this]{.underline}**, empirical studies show that not 20, not
30, not 98, but **[100 percent of those who have been killed are
dead.]{.underline}** And **[the mental and physical state of being dead
does not just "wrench the last meaningful interactions" from the dead
"often enough"; it does so always and permanently.]{.underline}** Maybe
I am being pedantic, but to me it seems that **[this is a very
significant difference between death and some forms of
torture]{.underline}**. Wisnewski and Emerick also offer the following
quote, this time from Sussman: \[U\]nlike other kinds of unwanted
imposition, **[pain characteristically compromises or undermines the
very capacities constitutive of autonomous agency itself]{.underline}**.
**[It is almost impossible to reflect, deliberate, or even think
straight when one is in agony]{.underline}**. When sufficiently intense,
**[pain becomes a person's entire universe and his entire
self]{.underline}**, crowding out every other aspect of his mental life.
Unlike other 24 On the Ethics of Torture harms, pain takes its victim's
agency apart "from the inside," such that the agent may never be able to
reconstitute himself fully.24 And they add: **[This is
sufficient]{.underline}**, it seems, **[to demonstrate that death is not
the greater of two harms]{.underline}**. In fact, **[quite the
contrary]{.underline}**.25 Before drawing such a conclusion, Wisnewski
and Emerick should perhaps first have compared torture with death. Let
us do this now: Unlike other kinds of unwanted imposition,
**[death]{.underline}** not only "characteristically," but absolutely
**[always compromises or undermines the very capacities constitutive of
autonomous agency itself]{.underline}**. It is not only almost, but
absolutely always impossible to reflect, deliberate, or even think
straight when one is dead. Not only when "sufficiently intense,"
whatever that means, but absolutely always **[death destroys a person's
entire universe and his entire self once and for all, destroying his
mental life completely]{.underline}**. Unlike other harms, **[death
destroys a victim's agency once and for all]{.underline}**, such that
the agent not only "may" never be able to reconstitute himself fully, he
is definitely unable to reconstitute himself at all. This is sufficient,
it seems, to demonstrate that not all forms of torture are a greater
harm than death. In fact, quite the contrary.

#### Util is correct even with torture, small sacrifices for greater good allows less evil

**Steinhoff 13**

(Uwe, department of Philosophy at University of Hong Kong, PhD in
Würzburg, Research Associate in the Oxford Leverhulme Programme on the
Changing Character of War at the Department of Politics and
International Relations at Oxford University, "The Moral Justification

Let me finally point to the utterly counterintuitive, indeed absurd
implications of the view that all forms of torture are worse than death
for third-party action. **[Surgeons]{.underline}** sometimes **[amputate
limbs of unconscious patients in order to save their
lives]{.underline}**. **[They do this on the very reasonable assumption
that those patients would prefer life without a hand or a leg to no life
at all.]{.underline}** And if the patients do not, they still have the
option to kill themselves afterwards. In the same vein, it seems to be
justified to cut off someone's hand in the following situation: **[the
victim's fingers have gotten caught in a machine]{.underline}** **[that
will slowly pull her in]{.underline}** and crush her. **[A third person
passes by]{.underline}**. **[The victim is]{.underline}** screaming in
pain, **[unable]{.underline}** **[to communicate]{.underline}** and thus
to **[consent]{.underline}** to any action of another person. **[The
only way to save the person's life is to cut off her hand with the
axe]{.underline}** the passerby has. **[It seems that he is entirely
justified in doing just that]{.underline}**. **[Cutting off the victim's
hand is the lesser evil]{.underline}**. **[It is for the victim's own
good]{.underline}**. In fact, all else being equal, the following seems
to be true: **[if you can see to it that the smaller of two possible
harms befalls a victim, you are justified in inflicting the smaller one
if this is the only way to prevent the bigger one]{.underline}**. Now
consider the following case: an innocent victim is about to be
waterboarded for half an hour by some torturers (perhaps even by
state-sanctioned state agents for interrogational purposes---if that
should matter). Someone else comes along, and the only way she could
possibly prevent the victim from being tortured is to shoot the victim.
If one really thinks that all forms of torture are worse than death, it
is unclear how absolutist torture opponents---unwarranted ad hoc claims
aside---can avoid the conclusion that it is justifiable to kill the
victim in this situation. I take this to be a reductio ad absurdum of
the view that all forms of torture are worse than killing. Clearly, the
absolutist torture opponent who, full well knowing that the victim will
only be waterboarded for half an hour, kills him anyway to spare him a
fate allegedly "worse than death" is quite simply morally insane.

#### Ethical rules change with important political actions

**Van Erp 13**

(Herman, Department of Philosophy at the University of Fort Hare,
"Political Obligation, Dirty Hands and Torture; A Moral Evaluation,"
South African Journal of Philosophy Vol. 32, Issue 1, pp. 112) // WhtCbn

Today, many complaints are heard about the deficiency of political
leadership on the global level. Fear of losing votes can easily become a
cause of political weakness. But dem**[anding political courage in the
abstract can be dangerous when connected with the widespread prejudice
that mass democracy slackens the sense of responsibility and is an
impediment to political courage]{.underline}**. Not seldom this courage
is connected with the idea that **[responsible political leaders may
hide their actions and commands]{.underline}**, that they may lie and
deceive the public opinion to prevent public indignation by not hurting
the moral feelings of the masses in difficult matters. This kind of
thinking about political leadership, which is fed by ideas concerning
the inadequacy of democratic decision procedures in a case of urgency,
has recently been defended in the context of the so called 'War on
terror'. **[Practices of torture have been tolerated and even
secretively instigated by democratic governments]{.underline}** **[by an
appeal]{.underline}** on this kind **[of obligation to improve political
decisiveness]{.underline}**. That it is impossible to keep one's hands
clean in realizing political ends seems to be common opinion. Hegel's
criticism of a morality that cherishes the ideal of a 'schöne Seele'
('beautiful soul') also accepts this opinion as true. And indeed, we
must not favour what Hegel calls 'the attitude of the chamberlain'
(Hegel 1807: 467ff). The chamberlain **[sees]{.underline}** **[the human
shortcomings and weaknesses of his master under private
conditions.]{.underline}** From that point of view, it is easy to
criticise the political hero. Such **[criticism and contempt is of
little relevance with]{.underline}** regard **[to the public or
political merit]{.underline}** of his master's actions. It seems
plausible that **[for]{.underline}** **[individual political
actions]{.underline}** **[of]{.underline}** some historical
**[importance]{.underline}** **[we must appeal to other standards than
the ethical rules for common daily life]{.underline}**. But it is also
true that democratic political virtue is allergic to utopian conceptions
of political heroism and leadership. Hegel affirms rightly that it **[is
impossible to act in a politically responsible way without accepting the
risk of doing wrong]{.underline}**. Would Hegel also subscribe
Machiavelli's famous dictum that political agents must learn how not to
be good? And if he did, would that involve a justification of crimes
committed by political leaders in the name of political necessity? In
the next section, I shall examine no further Hegel's approach to the
question but rather turn to the views of some contemporary moral
philosophers concerning this problem of politics and dirty hands.
