#### No China escalation

[The kind of U.S.-China jaw-jaw]{.underline} we have seen in the past
few weeks over trade, intellectual property, the future of technology
and innovation --- and over the past couple of years regarding the South
China Sea --- [is not unusual]{.underline}. In fact, [there have been
numerous similar escalations]{.underline} over the past few decades,
**[and not one has become a flash point triggering major
conflict]{.underline}**. Instead, [both China and the U.S. have
**consistently managed down**]{.underline}, rather than inflamed, [their
tensions]{.underline}. [This pattern of outbursts that dissipate
is]{.underline} not only understandable, it is also **[helpful for
China-U.S. relations]{.underline}** --- letting off steam to reduce
pressure (to keep the hot water metaphor going). Leaders on both sides
understand that [they each will need to send signals of being tough on
the other country from time to time, mostly **for domestic
purposes**]{.underline}. But [they share an understanding that these
outbursts are **not intended to trigger escalations**]{.underline} that
would do lasting damage to the relationship between China and the U.S.
Both countries benefit so much from their ever-greater economic
interdependence, even if they don't always like the terms of this
interdependence. So much for the history. Trump and Xi are clearly very
different leaders from their predecessors. Everyone knows that Donald
Trump wants to "make America great again." In his foreboding Destined
for War, Graham Allison summarizes Xi Jinping's ambition as to "make
China great again." Both leaders' focus very much begins at home, but
their domestic aspirations have big international consequences. Does
this mean "this time will be different" when it comes to China-U.S.
tensions? No ... and yes. No, in terms of bilateral China-U.S.
relations. **[The two countries will inevitably]{.underline}** continue
to **[spar]{.underline}**, [but neither wants to inflict a body blow on
the other because they would also be hurting themselves]{.underline}.
**[China-U.S. is a positive sum]{.underline}**, not a zero sum,
**[relationship]{.underline}**. Yes, in terms of China and the U.S. in
Asia. Instead of taking on each other directly, China and the U.S. are
wrestling for influence in Asia. The giants don't want to fight each
other, but they are willing and able to flex their muscles in the
region. This is making increasingly difficult the China-U.S. balancing
act Asia has so successfully executed in the past few decades, creating
unprecedented prosperity and stability in the region. Asian countries
should not, and will not, definitively "choose" between China and the
U.S. But different parts of Asia will shade more in one direction than
the other, because the American and Chinese strategies for the region
are very different. Since at least Barack Obama's "pivot" to Asia in
2011, the U.S. approach to Asia has focused more on geopolitics than on
geo-economics. Think increased U.S. military presence in Asia coupled
with walking away from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. China's approach
is the exact opposite. Very much aware of heightened sensitivities
regarding its assertions of sovereignty over Taiwan, Tibet and islands
in the South and East China Seas, China is increasingly emphasizing
geo-economics over geopolitics. Think the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank and the One Belt, One Road Initiative over naval
operations in contested waters. The following two charts paint a graphic
picture. Since 2011, the U.S. has sold nearly \$20B in military
equipment to its closest allies and friends in Asia. Chinese armament
sales have been both much smaller and concentrated in non-India South
Asia. Over the same period, trade with China has increased relative to
trade with the U.S. in the vast bulk of Asian countries --- against a
backdrop in which China was already the largest trading partner for most
of these countries. Add to this, the more than \$1 trillion of
preferential loans and construction projects China is planning to invest
in its One Belt, One Road Initiative: to build much needed
infrastructure in emerging economies in Asia and beyond; to create
export opportunities for Chinese infrastructure firms as the pace of
domestic projects inevitably slows; and above all, to increase China's
international influence in the process. How will Asia react to this
combination of American geopolitics and Chinese geo-economics? The New
York Times recently tried to sum it by putting countries into three
groups: "counteracting" China, "shifting toward China," and "playing
both sides." While it is overstated, **[there is real merit to this
framework]{.underline}**. Here are my friendly amendments to the Times's
Asia map: **[The U.S.'s core allies]{.underline}** (Australia, Japan and
Korea) [are trying to get closer to America in terms of military,
intelligence and communications]{.underline} (despite Trump's complaints
that the allies expect too much and do too little). The Chinese market
is extremely important to all three countries. But they do not need
Chinese infrastructure investment nearly as much as emerging Asia. As a
result, **[American geopolitics dominates Chinese geo-economics for
these countries]{.underline}**. Most ASEAN countries led (in size) by
Indonesia have little choice but to embrace Chinese geo-economics. For
all of these emerging markets, world-class infrastructure is the key to
realizing their full economic potential. Even if some ASEAN countries
have concerns about China's regional aspirations, the incentives to
welcome Chinese investment are overwhelming in the short to medium term.
Singapore is at the heart of ASEAN, but its position is much closer to
those of Australia, Japan and Korea than to its southeastern neighbors.
Real concerns about China's strategic ambitions, less need for Chinese
investment, and longer and deeper ties with the U.S. [Vietnam and the
Philippines are much more concerned about security
challenges]{.underline} from China than is the rest of ASEAN. **[But
they desperately need economic engagement with China]{.underline}**,
both trade and investment. As a result, [their embrace of the American
security umbrella will likely remain more muted]{.underline} --- easy to
understand given Vietnam's history, more perplexing given the
Philippines' long military relationship with the U.S. India is so big
that charting a more independent path is the natural move. India needs
the Chinese market, but issues such as water and Tibet along the long
border it shares with China mean that Sino-Indian relations will
inevitably be less than friendly. India has always been wary of the U.S.
both economically and militarily, but massive Chinese investment in
neighboring Pakistan and Bangladesh makes more collaboration with the
U.S. inevitable --- increasingly couched in terms of upgraded
relationships with the other stable democracies in Asia, Australia and
Japan (forming the "Quad" with the U.S.). The differences in these
trajectories are real. But it is important to reiterate that U.S.
geopolitics-China geo-economics is a continuum, not a dichotomous
either/or. [Every Asian country continues to benefit from, and to
expect, large-scale U.S. military presence in the region. Every Asian
country continues to benefit from China's economic rise]{.underline}.
What has changed is that increased China-U.S. tensions are leading both
major powers to turn up the heat on Asia. **[Neither great power can
afford large-scale confrontation with the other]{.underline}**. [They
are too co-dependent]{.underline}. But [they seem to be increasingly
comfortable with proxy wars]{.underline} in Asia. Don't expect a single
united Asian response. Do expect China-U.S. balancing to become
increasingly important, increasingly difficult, and increasingly
divergent in Asia.

### AT: Democracy 

#### DPT lacks explanatory power\-\--can't solve war

Fall of Liberal Democratic Peace Theory.\" Palladium Magazine.

Liberal [democratic peace theory]{.underline} (LDP), formulated largely
in the 1960s-1980s, [is viewed as one of the great wonders of
liberalism]{.underline} and a major point cited in favor of evangelizing
liberalism to the rest of the world. While there are variants, the basic
thesis is this: in the international arena, liberal democratic states
tend not to go to war with one another, because of the structural and/or
normative features of liberal democratic states. That is, liberalism as
such is directly responsible for the remarkable track record of peace.
In the post-World War II environment and doubly so in the post-Cold War
environment, more and more of the world was moving towards liberal
democracy. This was cause for excitement; world peace was on the
horizon. The Soviet Union had fallen, dictatorships were collapsing, and
the number of democracies was skyrocketing, prompting noted historian
[Spencer Weart to boldly
claim](https://www.amazon.com/Never-War-Democracies-Fight-Another/dp/0300082983)
that a "preponderance of democracies will transform the entire system of
international relations." The arc of history was bending in the
direction of liberalism and towards the democratic peace. **[But
something happened]{.underline}** in the early 2000s. The unfolding of
history as liberalism had been disrupted. The attacks of September 11,
the subsequent bungling of intelligence regarding WMDs, the United
States' decision to drag its NATO allies into a series of embarrassing
and ultimately ineffectual wars in the Middle East, numerous botched
attempts at regime change and nation-building, and aggressive
ideological demands as pre-conditions for diplomacy, have devastated the
credibility of the U.S.-driven, Western liberal order. In some areas,
**[history is now forking from the liberal path with a surprising
confidence]{.underline}**. [Axios [declared 2018 the year of the
strongman](https://www.axios.com/year-of-the-strongman-putin-xi-erdogan-sisi-maduro-0e528871-2add-425c-a092-0058abbe36ff.html),
but it can also be called the year of liberalism in crisis. Russia,
Egypt, China, Poland, Hungary, the Philippines, and
Turkey]{.underline}---among others---[have gained a renewed sense of
self and conviction in their opposition to liberalism]{.underline}, as
opposed to merely carving out for themselves an unprincipled exception
to liberalism and ceding it the moral high ground. **[Even in
Europe]{.underline}**, where liberal democracy claims some of its
greatest accomplishments, **[liberalism is beginning to
unravel]{.underline}** on the periphery in countries like Poland,
Hungary, and Italy. Jair Bolsonaro, who notably expressed sympathy for a
military dictatorship, has done tremendously well so far in the
Brazilian presidential election. Neither soft, nor hard evangelism of
liberalism is working the way it used to. For liberal theorists, [the
prospect of a liberal democratic world peace is now
questionable]{.underline}. The Economist has [put out a call to
arms](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2018/01/27/liberalism-is-the-most-successful-idea-of-the-past-400-years)
to defend liberalism as the most successful idea of the last 400 years.
Whether this call results in anything substantial remains to be seen.
But **[there is a palpable sense]{.underline}** that **[liberalism is
facing a serious new opposition]{.underline}**. Despite this trend,
liberalism's theorists have a hope encapsulated by [Daniel Deudney and
G. John Ikenberry's 2009
pronouncement](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2009-01-01/myth-autocratic-revival)
that "liberal states should not assume that history has ended, but they
can still be certain that it is on their side." And yet, in the nine
years following this bold pronouncement, [history has not been
especially kind to liberalism]{.underline}. Texas A&M political science
professor Christopher Layne, writing in early 2018, has [summed up the
current situation
aptly](https://academic.oup.com/ia/article-abstract/94/1/89/4762695),
namely that China as an increasingly self-aware superpower is already
reshaping the world order away from Pax Americana: The US foreign policy
establishment does not grasp this, and, instead, has invested the idea
of a 'rules-based, institutionalized' international order with a
talismanic quality. It claims that rules and institutions are
politically neutral, and, ipso facto, beneficial for all. However, in
international politics, who rules makes the rules. Rules and
institutions reflect the distribution of power in the international
system. A power transition is taking place in the early twenty-first
century: US power is in relative decline and China is rising quickly. No
international order---not even the Pax Americana---lasts forever. **[The
liberal world order cannot survive]{.underline}** the erosion of US
hegemonic power. It is **[this structural change, not Donald Trump, that
threatens the]{.underline}** post-Second World War **[international
order's survival]{.underline}**. It requires a huge leap of faith to
believe that a risen China will continue to subordinate itself to the
Pax Americana. Which brings us to the question: given that the prospect
of an expanded democratic peace is starting to hit some hard limits, how
well [does liberal democratic peace theory actually explain]{.underline}
the [peace]{.underline} that has existed among liberal democratic
states? Although LDP theory is essentially taken as an empirical law in
international relations, it has steadily picked up an increasing number
of qualifications, making the theory far less interesting than first
presented. As a sample, here are various renditions of the theory since
its modern inception in the 1960s: Claim 1: liberal democracies go to
war less than non-liberal democracies. Perhaps the most significant
abandonment in the field has been the monadic hypothesis: that liberal
democratic states are less likely to go to war compared to non-liberal
democratic states. Henry Farber and Joanne Gowa have [convincingly
shown](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2998170) that, statistically,
democracies on average have the same probability of going to war as
non-democracies. At this point, virtually no one holds the monadic
hypothesis, because of repeated confirmation of this finding. Claim 2:
no liberal democracy has fought another liberal democracy since 1816
(notably after 1812) This claim from Michael Doyle has increasingly
fallen out of favor. There weren't many democracies prior to 1945, and
so the number of dyadic pairs of liberal democratic countries that could
have gone to war was extremely limited. For example, Doyle excludes
Great Britain from counting as a liberal democracy until 1832 and denies
that the Spanish-American War of 1898 should count, even though the
Polity II data set lists Spain as a democracy in 1898. Others have
argued that the Second Philippines War of 1899 shouldn't count either,
as at the time the Philippines hadn't held an election yet. This strong
claim has largely been dropped because of a) exception cases that
require new qualifications to explain, and b) the fact that there
weren't enough existing liberal democracies to achieve significance. All
totaled, there are around 50 exception cases suggested in the
literature. Claim 3: mature liberal democracies tend not to go to
war/don't go to war with one another Although Peru and Ecuador fought
while both were liberal democracies, some maintain that the war occurred
before the "pacifying effects" of liberal democracy had enough time to
work, meaning maturity was lacking. Yet another qualification.
Interestingly, the U.S. intervened militarily to topple Salvador Allende
after he was democratically elected in Chile. Israel invaded Lebanon in
1981, but at the time, Lebanon's government was in disarray. R.J. Rummel
states that the Israeli attack on the United States' USS Liberty in 1967
counts as conflict below the level of war, but argued that Israel at the
time was "only partially free." That Finland joined up with the fascists
from 1941 to 1944 apparently shouldn't count, as no Finnish troops
attacked troops from a liberal democratic country, though Great Britain
bombed Finland in 1941. Claim 4: mature liberal democracies in the
post-1945 era don't go to war with one another The addition of the
'post-1945 era' qualification came later in the development of LDP
theory, and while it may be a disappointing qualification, it may be
necessary, given the small-N universe of liberal democracies before
1945. Bruce Russett [admits
that](https://books.google.com/books?id=_Wo4_nwxO9AC&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26&dq=%22the+absence+of+murderous+quarrels+between%22&source=bl&ots=kss4YmarIA&sig=6hxz_4HYYsFU9fTdaH2Nr0m0CBQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj6svTTuvrdAhXnxFQKHVc0BNkQ6AEwAXoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22the%20absence%20of%20murderous%20quarrels%20between%22&f=false)
"the absence of murderous quarrels between democracies was not too
surprising, and may need---at least for the pre-1945 era---little
further explanation." Claim 5: mature liberal democracies in the
post-1945 era don't go to war with one another, but for normative
reasons, not structural reasons It's claimed that the structural
elements of liberal democratic states, namely separation of powers,
checks and balances, elections, the free press, etc. should result in
less war in general, but this is essentially equivalent to the monadic
hypothesis, which has been largely abandoned. So, it might be possible
to explain the absence of war through the normative mechanisms of
liberal democratic states, as opposed to structural elements. Zeev Maoz
and Bruce Russett argue that while there is some support for the
structural model, the [normative model has more support and better
consistency](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2938740?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents).
The above are just a few of the continuing iterations of the theory.
This trajectory is by no means perfectly linear, nor is there consensus
among theorists on how many qualifications are required, but the fact
that these qualifications have continued to pile on is evidence that LDP
theory is now much closer on the spectrum to triviality than when first
introduced. And in general, the statistical approach adopted by much of
the literature is somewhat methodologically wrong-headed; it assumes
statistical properties which don't necessarily hold in fat-tailed
structural processes like war. But on some level, LDP seems intuitive,
first because we're naturally more amenable to arguments that uphold our
traditions of liberalism, and second because both North America and
Europe are now overwhelmingly comprised of liberal democratic states and
have enjoyed a near-unparalleled level of peace and prosperity over the
last 70 years. So, it's natural to posit that liberal principles
embedded in liberal democratic states are salient. **[While it is
true]{.underline}** that **[there is an empirical track record of peace
and prosperity between liberal democratic states]{.underline}** in
Europe and North America, especially following the conclusion of World
War II, **[the mere absence of war does not automatically vindicate the
theory]{.underline}**. [Zero is not]{.underline} necessarily
[statistically significant, since that result might]{.underline} simply
[be predicted by random chance]{.underline}, as is the case with
lightning strikes. People are struck by lightning all the time, but none
of my friends have ever been. Aside from issues of statistical
significance, [the primary task is to actually offer falsifiable
explanations and causal mechanisms]{.underline} supporting LDP theory.
If liberal principles explain the peace, how would we demonstrate that
causal influence, as opposed to merely positing it? From the LDP side,
while there are a host of mechanisms adopted to explain democratic
peace**[, astonishingly little research has been
conducted]{.underline}** into **[whether]{.underline}** these
**[mechanisms of liberalism]{.underline}** actually **[work to guarantee
the democratic peace]{.underline}**, suggesting a sort of "taken for
grantedness" that has become characteristic of current liberalism.
Michael Doyle's [recent expression of LDP
theory](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30038953?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)
in the article "Three Pillars of the Liberal Peace" stands out as a
careful explication of the causal logic underlying LDP theory. According
to Doyle, there are three mechanisms at play, and all three must be in
operation simultaneously to generate the democratic peace. The first
mechanism is that LD states are accountable to voters, especially the
median voter. As such, these states "preclude monarchs or dictators
turning their potentially aggressive interests into public policy while
assuming that the costs will be borne by a subordinate public." The
second mechanism is that liberal principles or norms entail respect for
legitimate individual rights, which are externalized in foreign policy.
As Doyle puts it, "Domestically just republics...presume foreign
republics to be also consensual, just, and therefore deserving of the
accommodation that the individuals that compose them deserve." Moreover,
the free press in liberal democratic states also helps to hold officials
accountable to liberal principles. The third mechanism is that commerce
between liberal democratic states binds them together in a way that
strongly discourages war. The first mechanism of [accountability
assumes]{.underline} that [voters pay close attention to war, don't like
war, and can't be manipulated into bearing]{.underline} the [costs of
war]{.underline}. **[These assumptions seem implausible when examining
America's track record]{.underline}** over just the last two decades.
Yemen, as [just one example out of
countless](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/us/politics/green-berets-saudi-yemen-border-houthi.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news),
probably does not even register as a country to the median voter. [The
U.S. is [currently at
war](https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/a3ywd5/white-house-acknowledges-the-us-is-at-war-in-seven-countries)
in at least seven different countries]{.underline}. [The]{.underline}
first [mechanism also assumes voters who are able to]{.underline}
accurately [assess]{.underline} the [success or failure of
policies]{.underline}, accurately assign responsibility for success or
failure, [and then electorally reward or punish elites]{.underline}.
**[This]{.underline}** concept **[is known as retrospective
voting]{.underline}**. In retrospective voting, voters cast ballots
based on results, not policies as such. Outcomes, then, have the
potential of functioning as a quick and easy heuristic for voters to
rely on to overcome policy ignorance and compel liberal democratic
leaders to act beneficially. But [in a 2013 study, Bryan Caplan et al.
[determined that voters systematically
overestimate](http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/politicalinfluence.pdf)
the influence of politicians]{.underline} on the economy and
systematically underestimate their influence on education and the
federal budget. [The prognosis for retrospective voting is
grim]{.underline}: "As long as ignorant and irrational voters know
enough to properly reward success and punish failure, democracy can
still work well. Unfortunately, retrospective voting requires a largely
undefended assumption: Voters' beliefs about political influence are
unbiased." That is, [voters overestimate, underestimate, and misallocate
influence.]{.underline} Numerous other studies have examined voters'
strange propensity to vote out incumbents based on bad circumstances out
of incumbents' control. One such study found that [voters punished U.S.
governors in oil-producing
states](http://users.nber.org/~jwolfers/papers/Voterrationality(latest).pdf)
based on fluctuating world oil prices. Another determined that the
[success or failure of incumbent politicians in Latin
America](http://www.fgv.br/professor/ebape/cesar.zucco/files/PaperJOP2016.pdf)
was based on U.S. interest rates, in addition to international commodity
prices. Voters also c[onsistently punish incumbents for droughts and
floods](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/csdi/research/CSDI_WP_05-2013.pdf).
These results illustrate the deep flaws of retrospective voting. While
the above work undermines retrospective voting in the abstract,
Sebastian Rosato [looked specifically at voter
behavior](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3593025) in the context of lost
wars and found that both liberal democratic and autocratic leaders have
similar chances of being removed from power for losing wars, but not a
single one of the liberal democratic leaders was actually punished. In
contrast, 29 percent of autocratic leaders were either killed,
imprisoned, or exiled. For wars that are costly, but not lost, that is,
wars where there is one fatality per 2,000 population, autocrats were
removed from power 35 percent of the time. They were also punished in 27
percent of cases. Democratic leaders, on the other hand, get off a lot
easier, and were only removed 27 percent of the time and punished in
just 7 percent of cases. Such findings cast doubt on the first pillar
for explaining democratic peace. The second pillar focuses on the
externalization of liberal democratic norms and principles to the
international arena via media publicity and other avenues, which causes
liberal democratic states to treat other liberal democratic states with
trust and respect, even in cases where there are serious clashes of
interests. This logic does not extend to liberal democratic states
respecting non-liberal democratic states in the same way and under the
same conditions. But **[norm externalization has not
applied]{.underline}** in crucial cases. In a 1994 paper, Christopher
[Layne used [process-tracing to determine that liberal norms and
principles did not explain any
part](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2539195?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)
of why near-miss wars did not occur]{.underline} between the United
States and Britain in 1861, France and Great Britain in 1898, and France
and Germany in 1923, as public opinion was not pacific and elites did
not refrain from making threats, among other indicators. Additionally,
[if liberal democratic norms operate]{.underline} internationally [to
prevent conflict, a fortiori they should operate
domestically]{.underline}. **[But according to Håvard
Hegre]{.underline}**, once GDP per capita is controlled for**[, it turns
out that [democratic states are no less likely to suffer from internal
conflict](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022343313512852),
compared to autocracies]{.underline}**. The [historical
record]{.underline} also [indicates that the U.S. aggressively
intervened in democracies and subsequently installed autocratic
regimes]{.underline}. Several recent and notable interventions were:
Iran in 1953, Guatemala in 1954, Indonesia in 1957, British Guyana in
1961, Brazil in 1961 and 1964, Chile in 1973, and Nicaragua in 1984.
Doyle's response is two-fold: first, the democracies weren't democratic
enough or weren't fully liberal democratic states, and second, these
U.S. interventions were covert, meaning that elites subverted a crucial
liberal democratic mechanism. The first response could arguably apply to
Iran, Indonesia, and Nicaragua, which at the time were quite immature
democracies, but certainly the regimes at the time were more democratic
than previous regimes. The other states, however, were much more
democratic. The second response about covert action misses the point. If
the mechanisms to explain such an outcome do not work as described in
even a small number of cases, so much the worse for the mechanisms.
Appeal to covert action to save the mechanism is simply an admission of
its limited explanatory power. The third and final pillar concerns [the
claim of conflict-reducing interdependencies between nations caused by
trade]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} supposing this is true---and the
literature is mixed on this point---[trade is not a principle or
mechanism exclusive in any way to liberalism]{.underline}. And the
argument that free trade specifically is necessary for this mechanism to
work is 1) putting an enormous amount of stock in the difference between
"free" and "unfree" trade, and 2) missing the point that free trade may
be best understood here as a proxy either for liberal democratic states
in the same military alliance or for the relationship between a liberal
democratic state and a small vassal state, in which no military conflict
is necessary to achieve desired economic domination. For Doyle, the
underlying mechanisms providing the causal logic for LDP theory must
always and at all times be in play for LDP theory to work. But this
position is in fact dangerously close to a tautology, as the second
mechanism holds that liberal democratic states' liberal principles of
respect, trust, and the recognition of legitimate individual rights are
externalized in its foreign policy. What this effectively translates to
is that **[it necessarily has to be]{.underline}** the case **[that
liberal democratic states treat other]{.underline}** liberal democratic
**[states with respect and trust for there to be a low likelihood of
war, which is uninformative.]{.underline}** If the causal logic of these
mechanisms is broken, or if there are numerous historical case studies
in which these mechanisms actually do not prevent war or explain
near-misses between liberal democratic states, then other candidate
mechanisms should be explored to explain the democratic peace. One way
of trying to answer the question of what best explains the lack of war
in Europe and North America is to imagine hypothetical scenarios from
the perspective of elite decision-makers in a dyad and come up with
plausible conditions under which war might emerge. What conditions would
have to obtain in the current geopolitical environment for Germany to go
to war with France, or England to go to war with France, or Germany to
go to war with Greece, etc.? Let's start with the last hypothetical,
although it will sound odd because war in Western Europe is almost
inconceivable in the post-World War II environment. But imagine we
broaden the circle and German decision-makers become so incensed with
Greece's lack of fiscal continence that Germany decides to invade
Greece. First, Germany's military is currently not capable of launching
and sustaining a land or air war in Europe. Second, both Germany and
Greece belong to the same U.S.-engineered military alliance, NATO, and
so other NATO member states would be obliged to defend Greece. Third, in
order to get to the point where the proposal of war in this instance
would even be on the table, the German state would have to be filled
with---and German voters would have to vote for---an entirely new elite
dominated by an entirely new and aggressive way of thinking. The United
States engineered the post-World War II environment specifically to
ensure this does not occur, and continually maintains this environment
with both hard and soft power---the former via its enduring military
presence on the continent and the latter via diplomatic censure and its
many U.S.-funded or coordinated non-governmental organizations. Replace
Greece in this example with France, and an additional point of
consideration appears: France has nuclear weapons. For any other
conceivable dyad, many or most of these considerations will also apply,
and none have any strong relationship with liberal principles or
mechanisms, with the exception in this case of the admitted liberal
character of the German elite. However, this of course is due to the
fact that a large part of Germany was a U.S. vassal state immediately
after 1945 and still maintains much of that character as a militarily
and diplomatically-occupied country. In the end, the public narrative
might be that Germany decided not to invade Greece because of its pure
adherence to liberal principles, but we might have reason to doubt such
an explanation. It would be a mistake to think of foreign policy
decision-makers as purely motivated by power, just like it would be a
mistake to conceive of them as purely utility maximizers. Humans in
general are motivated by a multiplicity of goods and generally possess a
certain baseline level of sociability. But the claim here is that the
motivations of sociability for peace are downstream of identity
relations, and identity relations in the post-1945 era emphatically were
constructed as part of Pax Americana, the new, U.S.-led order. Moreover,
due to the way sovereignty is de facto distributed in the post-World War
II environment, Germany is not quite the right unit for war and is part
of an arguably post-national order. While Germany is technically
considered to be a sovereign state, the idea of it practically
exercising this sovereignty to invade Greece and get away with it is not
very plausible. The long arm of the U.S., NATO, the European Union, and
the United Nations would instantly put a stop to such a move. The more
appropriate unit for war is more like NATO versus a rogue liberal
democratic state or a rogue NATO member state---perhaps Turkey. If NATO
did in fact go to war against its member state Turkey, democratic peace
theorists might claim that this is no way counts as a point against
their thesis. After all, Turkey isn't exactly a shining example of
liberal democracy. But what they're missing here is that [regime
character is fundamentally downstream of power relations and historical
processes]{.underline}. **[In the West, liberal democracy is the only
game]{.underline}** in town, **[and the extent to which other countries
have adopted liberal democracy is a reliable indicator of the extent to
which they have become integrated into the U.S.-dominated geopolitical
order]{.underline}**. The process of "becoming liberal," in other words,
is virtually indistinguishable historically from "integration into the
U.S.-dominated geopolitical order." And [integration has not been a
passive process]{.underline}. Non-democracies, [as Christopher Hobson
has noted](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23025581), have historically
been labeled threatening, both behaviorally and ontologically by the
West. In what almost follows naturally from this labeling process, [the
West has taken upon itself to employ coercive democratization or
sanctions to subordinate recalcitrant polities]{.underline}, often
resulting in worse developmental indicators in these countries, which
again reinforces the superiority of liberal democracies over other
competing systems. We can see this process currently at play in Iraq,
Iran, Russia, and North Korea, among many others. Unfortunately, we
don't have the luxury of examining a parallel universe identical to ours
with the exception that geopolitical historical processes have no impact
on regime character, such that it can be observed that states adopt
liberal democracy in a vacuum and then exhibit the democratic peace
among one another. In other words, we have a problem of collinearity.
Still, that doesn't mean a case for LDP can't be made in the actual
world. However, [there are few convincing case studies of countries
adopting liberal democracy in the absence of other pacifying
factors]{.underline}, such as power relations during the Cold War, in
which countries either sorted themselves or were sorted into blocs based
on alliance with the Western order or the Soviet order. The world order
is changing. **[Liberal democratic peace theory is]{.underline}** slowly
**[losing relevance]{.underline}**. Liberal evangelism feels passé,
given recent regime change failures in the Middle East and North Africa,
and backsliding in Eastern Europe. Theorists may soon be forced by
events to confront the possibility that liberal democratic regimes,
rather than demonstrating intrinsic benefits of liberalism as such, are
little more than the preferred regime-type of Pax Americana.

#### Democracy lacks a causal explanation for peace 

Renske **Doorenspleet 19**. Associate Professor in Comparative Politics
at the University of Warwick and academic leader of \'The Politics of
Hope\'. 2019. \"Democracy and Interstate War.\" SpringerLink.
https://link-springer-com.libproxy1.usc.edu/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-91656-9_3#Abs1.

My chapter, though, did not look for specific studies which could
support one specific argument (e.g. 'democracy is a good thing' or
'democracy has instrumental value as it brings peace between states').
The aim of the chapter was to investigate the question whether democracy
leads to interstate war or peace, [by analyzing dozens of statistical
studies]{.underline} which have been selected in a systematic way. The
analyses [revealed many caveats]{.underline}. The first caveat is that
**[none of the studies which have directly tested]{.underline}** the
**[democratic peace]{.underline}** hypothesis
**[demonstrated]{.underline}** that **[democracy is the only and most
important factor when explaining interstate war]{.underline}**. Some
[studies provided evidence]{.underline} that [other factors are
significant as well, and]{.underline} other studies [indicated that
alternative explanations are]{.underline} much [more
powerful]{.underline}, sometimes even [showing]{.underline} that [the
impact of democracy is simply spurious]{.underline}. Geographical and
economic factors, for example, play a key role as well, and tend to be
far more important, so it is certainly not only democracy which matters.
Secondly, these **[findings are based on quantitative studies, which
show correlation but not]{.underline}** necessarily
**[causation]{.underline}**. While there is a lively ongoing debate
about the causal mechanisms, it is still unclear how we can understand
and interpret the expected absence of interstate war between
democracies. The number of studies which criticize these ideas has
increased considerably since the mid-1990s, not just theoretically but
particularly empirically as [there is no strong evidence to back up the
ideas that norms and institutional constraints are the key
mechanisms]{.underline} (see Hayes
[2011](https://link-springer-com.libproxy1.usc.edu/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-91656-9_3#CR68)).
Moreover, the quest to find the underlying mechanisms should not get
priority anyway in future research, in my view, as the statistical
evidence for the democratic peace hypotheses is weak overall (see first
caveat above). Thirdly, **[democracies are not more peaceful than
dictatorships]{.underline}**. While there might be some evidence for
democratic peace among democratic states (or at least a correlation),
democracies are not more peaceful in general. [The evidence for a
monadic link is not clear, not significant and]{.underline} certainly
[not robust]{.underline}. There is no clear support for the monadic
peace hypothesis which states that interstate war is less likely in
democracies compared to dictatorships in general. And democracies do
fight with dictatorships---quite a lot. Finally, 'democratizing for
peace' seems a dangerous route to take, as [democratizing states fight
most---more than both democracies and dictatorships]{.underline}.
Democracies might not fight with each other, but the countries that are
democratizing are quite war-prone. Moreover, there is convincing
evidence that hybrid systems (or semi-democracies) are more likely to be
involved in interstate wars, not only compared to countries with higher
levels of democracy but also to countries with lower levels of
democracy. **[Democratization can be]{.underline}** a very
**[unpredictable and]{.underline}** possibly **[dangerous]{.underline}**
process, **[and]{.underline}** the findings in this chapter show that
democratizing for peace is likely to **[end in a deadly
disaster]{.underline}**. Based on those findings, this chapter comes to
the controversial conclusion that eventually [we cannot defend the
notion that it really matters whether you live in a dictatorship or
democracy]{.underline}, at least not [with regard to the likelihood that
an interstate war will take place]{.underline} in your country. In other
words, **[democracy is not a panacea for peace]{.underline}** in
general, and we cannot be sure that people living in democracies have
less chance to experience an interstate war compared to people living in
dictatorships. People living in democratizing and hybrid systems seem to
be most at risk, which means promoting democratization would not be
wise, at least not when achieving peace is the ultimate goal. Hence,
[war is most likely in democratizing countries]{.underline}. Still, the
chance of an interstate war is low in the other political systems---so
not only in democracies but in dictatorships as well. In this sense, the
idea that democracies make a significant difference is not
convincing.[ 43 ](https://link-springer-com.libproxy1.usc.edu/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-91656-9_3#FPar1)The
(instrumental) value of democracy cannot be found in being less
war-prone and bringing peace between countries.

#### No causal relationship between democracy and peace\-\--best studies 

Michael **Mousseau 18**. Professor of International Relations Theory at
the University of Central Florida. 2018. \"Grasping the scientific
evidence: The contractualist peace supersedes the democratic peace.\"

[No one]{.underline} has [challenged the multiple reports that
contractualist economy is the strongest]{.underline} nontrivial
[predictor of peace]{.underline} both [within]{.underline} (Mousseau,
2012b) [and between nations]{.underline} (Mousseau, 2013; see also
Nieman, 2015). **[The only]{.underline}** matter in **[controversy is
whether democracy has any impact on peace]{.underline}** after
consideration of contractualist economy. I [investigated all five
reasons offered in the literature]{.underline} (excluding
already-refuted arguments) [to think democracy causes peace, and found
no support for any]{.underline} of them. The **[correlation of democracy
with peace is zero regardless of how]{.underline}** contractualist
economy or interstate **[conflict is measured]{.underline}**; the
disaggregation of [the data yields no support for a causal interaction
of democracy with contractualist economy, and]{.underline} the state of
knowledge [offers no evidence of causation from democracy
to]{.underline} contractualist economy and [peace]{.underline}. While
some correlation of democracy with peace appears in analyses of all
disputes (at the 0.10 level), this appears to be a statistical artifact,
since democracy is near zero in analyses of wars, fatal-only disputes
(Mousseau, 2009, 2012a, 2013 and above), and militarized crises
(Mousseau et al., 2013a, b). Analyses of all-disputes are less accurate
than those of fatal disputes and crises because they are more likely to
include events that are not state-to-state confrontations, and more
likely to under-report events occurring in clientelist dyads. We saw
that clientelist [democracies tend to be geographically dispersed, and
this may account for the non-fatal peace, which does not exist in
bordering dyads where everyone has an equal chance to
fight]{.underline}. The [non-fatal correlation]{.underline} of democracy
with peace [is also marginal]{.underline}, as we saw in Table 4 that it
includes only 27% of dyads and only 50% of joint-democratic dyads. This
study largely investigated unsupported assertions of fact and showed
them to lack support: neither DOR nor Ray (2013) properly supported
their claims that multiple imputation, the treatment of ongoing dispute
years, an interaction, the adoption of an alternative measure for
contractualist economy, or reverse causality actually restore the
evidence for the democratic peace. In this way this study merely
corroborated what was already the state of knowledge, and it would be a
mistake to think there are continuing factual differences in this
controversy. I cannot promise that the analyses herein are error free,
and I fully expect defenders of the democratic peace to carefully
scrutinize them for errors, but **[no claim of error should be perceived
as resurrecting the correlation of democracy with peace unless it
is]{.underline}** also **[shown to change results]{.underline}**. Nor
has anyone disputed the overturning of the democratic peace as reported
in two studies (Mousseau, 2009, 2012a). While DOR (205) assert that the
analyses in Mousseau (2009) are based on a misinterpreted interaction
term, there is no such interaction term in Mousseau (2009). [The only
evidence-based defense of]{.underline} the [democratic peace that
exists]{.underline} today [comes from DOR's 120 regressions, 101 of
which are invalid]{.underline}. Of the 19 valid ones, [only 15 are of
fatal dispute]{.underline}s that count, [and every one of these
15]{.underline} regressions [is mired by]{.underline} one of two
[questionable practices: five include control for the DemocracyH term
that is said to artificially inflate]{.underline} the
[democracy]{.underline} coefficient; 10 are irrelevant because they
include the inconsequential interaction term additionally calculated at
the misleading 75th percentile of contractualist economy. **[If there is
a correlation of democracy with peace, why cannot this be shown in a
clear-cut regression?]{.underline}** Beyond the facts, [scientific
assessment calls for acknowledgment of the imbalance of
theory]{.underline} in this controversy. Economic norms theory does not
deny the correlation of democracy with peace, and thus all prior
evidence for it; rather, it offers a specific and falsifiable
explanation for the correlation that identifies it as spurious.
**[Defenders of]{.underline}** the **[democratic peace]{.underline}**
are not putting forth a competing explanation for the correlation;
rather, they **[simply oppose the idea that democracy does not
independently cause peace, with no reason]{.underline}** given for this
opposition. However, democracy is not a random variable, so there are no
scientific grounds that prohibit us from seeking to explain it, and
there are no scientific grounds that preclude that whatever explains
[democracy cannot]{.underline} also [explain]{.underline} the [peace.
Causality, not statistics, lies at the core of this
controversy]{.underline}, and causality cannot be directly seen: it can
only be theorized and corroborated. Yet **[defenders of]{.underline}**
the **[democratic peace have not addressed any]{.underline}** of the
**[extensive corroborations of economic norms]{.underline}** theory
**[accrued in studies of civil conflict and]{.underline}** insurgency
(Mousseau, 2012b), terrorism (Meierrieks 2012; Boehmer and Daube, 2013;
Krieger and Meierrieks, 2015), **[democratization]{.underline}** (Aytacx
et al., 2016), and human rights (Mousseau and Mousseau, 2008). The
weight of evidence for [economic norms theory overwhelms any theory of
democracy causing peace]{.underline} (Ungerer, 2012), yet defenders of
the proposition have sought only to report some statistically
significant correlation of democracy with peace, as if correlation
equals causation (Dafoe, 2011; Dafoe and Russett, 2013; DOR; Ray, 2013;
Russett, 2010). Nor is there any scientific basis for concluding that
this controversy is ultimately unresolvable because the factors are
closely related, as is frequently asserted without support (e.g. DOR:
203). The relevant factors are not closely related: contractualist
economy is only moderately correlated with trade interdependence (0.31),
income (0.71/0.56), and democracy (0.47) (Mousseau, 2013: 191--193).
That contractualist nations are almost always democratic does not mean
that democratic nations are almost always contractualist, and the
majority 57% of democracies had clientelist economies from 1950 to 2010.
**[The notion that democracy, market development, and trade are
synonymous is rooted in ignorance]{.underline}**, and ignorance cannot
justify discarding, after the fact, our carefully constructed measures
and datasets.13 The implications of this study are far from trivial: the
democratic peace, defined as [democracy causing peace, lacks the
evidentiary core on which it is based; the observation of democratic
peace is best explained by contract norms]{.underline}. If our field is
to abide by scientific rules of evidence, then our scholars must stop
describing democracy as a ''known'' cause, or correlate, of peace, and
we must stop tossing in a variable for democracy, willy-nilly, in
quantitative analyses of international conflict. [The variable to
replace it is contractualist economy, which]{.underline} not only
subsumes democracy but [is now the most powerful non-trivial factor in
the study of international conflict]{.underline}, whose impact is more
than 10 times that which we once thought democracy had. No historical
study is immune to criticism, but the progress of knowledge will not be
furthered with another (third) round of ardently asserted claims of
error that are not shown to change results. I understand the prior view
of democratic peace is known and intuitive and the contractualist peace
is less so, and unsupported assertions are enough for many to believe in
already-known claims. However, the purpose of science is to promote
rather than stifle innovation, and to differentiate good ideas from bad
ones. Better yet are new ideas that can help make the world a better
place, and economic norms theory is clear on that: if the wealthy
market-oriented nations wish to advance democracy and peace around the
world, the way to do that is to promote economic opportunity.

### AT: Disease 

#### No impact\-\--disease won't cause extinction 

**Adalja 16** -- \[Amesh Adalja, infectious disease physician at the
University of Pittsburgh\] "Why Hasn\'t Disease Wiped out the Human
Race?" June 17, 2016
(http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/06/infectious-diseases-extinction/487514/)

But when people ask me if I'm worried about infectious diseases, they're
often not asking about the threat to human lives; they're asking about
the threat to human life. [With each outbreak of a headline-grabbing
emerging infectious disease comes a fear of extinction
itself]{.underline}. The fear envisions a large proportion of humans
succumbing to infection, leaving no survivors or so few that the species
can't be sustained. I'm not afraid of this apocalyptic scenario, but I
do understand the impulse. [Worry about the end is a quintessentially
human trait. Thankfully, so is our resilience. For most of mankind's
history, infectious diseases were the existential threat to
humanity---and for good reason. They were quite successful at killing
people]{.underline}: The 6th century's Plague of Justinian knocked out
an estimated 17 percent of the world's population; the 14th century
Black Death decimated a third of Europe; the 1918 influenza pandemic
killed 5 percent of the world; malaria is estimated to have killed half
of all humans who have ever lived. [Any yet, of course, humanity
continued to flourish. Our species' recent explosion in lifespan is
almost exclusively the result of the control of infectious diseases
**through sanitation, vaccination, and antimicrobial
therapies**]{.underline}. Only in the modern era, in which many
infectious diseases have been tamed in the industrial world, do people
have the luxury of death from cancer, heart disease, or stroke in the
8th decade of life. Childhoods are free from watching siblings and
friends die from outbreaks of typhoid, scarlet fever, smallpox, measles,
and the like. [So **what would it take for a disease to wipe out
humanity now?**]{.underline} In Michael Crichton's The Andromeda Strain,
the canonical book in the disease-outbreak genre, an alien microbe
threatens the human race with extinction, and humanity's best minds are
marshaled to combat the enemy organism. Fortunately, outside of fiction,
there's no reason to expect alien pathogens to wage war on the human
race any time soon, and [my analysis suggests that any real-life
domestic microbe reaching an extinction level of threat probably is just
as unlikely. Any apocalyptic pathogen would need to possess a very
special combination of two attributes. **First, it would have to be so
unfamiliar that no existing therapy or vaccine could be applied to it**.
**Second, it would need to have a high and surreptitious
transmissibility before symptoms occur**. The first is essential because
any microbe from a known class of pathogens would]{.underline}, by
definition, [have family members that could serve as models for
containment and countermeasures. The second would allow the hypothetical
disease to spread without being detected by even the most astute
clinicians. The three infectious diseases most likely to be considered
extinction-level threats]{.underline} in the world today---[influenza,
HIV, and Ebola]{.underline}---[don't meet these two requirements.
Influenza]{.underline}, for instance, despite its well-established
ability to kill on a large scale, its contagiousness, and its unrivaled
ability to shift and drift away from our vaccines, [is still what I
would call a "known unknown."]{.underline} While there are many
mysteries about how new flu strains emerge, from at least the time of
Hippocrates, [humans have been attuned to its risk. And in the modern
era, **a full-fledged industry of influenza preparedness exists**, with
effective **vaccine** strategies and **antiviral** therapies.
HIV]{.underline}, which has killed 39 million people over several
decades, [is similarly limited]{.underline} due to several factors.
[Most importantly, HIV's dependency on]{.underline} blood and [body
fluid for transmission (similar to Ebola) requires **intimate
human-to-human contact, which limits contagion**. Highly potent
antiviral therapy allows most people to live normally with the disease,
and a substantial group of the population has **genetic mutations that
render them impervious** to infection in the first place. Lastly,
**simple prevention strategies** such as needle exchange for injection
drug users and barrier contraceptives---when available---**can curtail
transmission risk**. Ebola, for many of the same reasons as
HIV]{.underline} as well as several others, [also falls short of the
mark.]{.underline} This is especially due to the fact that [it spreads
almost exclusively through people with easily recognizable symptoms,
plus the taming of its]{.underline} once unfathomable 90 percent
[mortality rate by simple supportive care. Beyond those three, every
other known disease falls short]{.underline} of what seems required to
wipe out humans---which is, of course, why we're still here. And it's
not that diseases are ineffective. On the contrary, diseases' failure to
knock us out is a testament to just how resilient humans are. [Part of
our evolutionary heritage is our immune system, one of the most complex
on the planet, even **without**]{.underline} the benefit of **[vaccines
or]{.underline}** the helping hand of antimicrobial [**drugs**. This
system]{.underline}, when viewed at a species level, [**can adapt to
almost any enemy imaginable**. Coupled to **genetic
variations**]{.underline} amongst humans---[which open up the
possibility for]{.underline} a range of advantages, from [imperviousness
to]{.underline} infection to [a tendency for mild symptoms---this
adaptability ensures that **almost any infectious disease onslaught will
leave a large proportion of the population alive to
rebuild**,]{.underline} in contrast to the fictional Hollywood versions.
While the immune system's role can never be understated, [an even more
powerful protector is the faculty of **consciousness**.]{.underline}
Humans are not the most prolific, quickly evolving, or strongest
organisms on the planet, but as Aristotle identified, **[humans are the
rational animals]{.underline}**---and it is this fundamental
distinguishing characteristic that allows humans to form abstractions,
think in principles, and plan long-range. [These capacities, in turn,
allow humans to modify, **alter**, and improve themselves and their
environments. Consciousness equips us]{.underline}, at an individual and
a species level, [to make nature safe]{.underline} for the species
through such technological marvels as antibiotics, antivirals, vaccines,
and sanitation. When humans began to focus their minds on the problems
posed by infectious disease, human life ceased being nasty, brutish, and
short. In many ways, human consciousness became infectious diseases'
worthiest adversary.

Ironically, [White seems almost convinced that China would be willing to
engage in nuclear war over Taiwan, an assumption that is both untested
and portrays the leadership in Beijing as a bunch of **deranged

depicting Taiwan as a "core issue," it is]{.underline} in my view
[**unlikely** that the C]{.underline}hinese [C]{.underline}ommunist
[P]{.underline}arty [would unleash its nuclear arsenal over the matter
of Taiwan]{.underline}; in fact, I would advance that [it is probably
**unwilling to gamble China's economy** over Taiwan by launching major
military operations---all the more so if there is a promise that such a
course of action would result in a concerted response on the part of the
international community. The logic of deterrence is that it diminishes
the likelihood that the international community would be faced with the
maximalist options given us by White]{.underline}. (The bluster only
works if we believe it---and Beijing wants us to believe it just like
the good professor seems to do---as winning without a fight is a
foundational element of Chinese military strategy.)

#### Even if China seeks reunification, they won't use military force

The [shift in China's military approach towards Taiwan]{.underline}¶ As
[China's policy towards Taiwan has changed from a tougher
approach]{.underline} during the Jiang Zemin era [to a more moderate
approach]{.underline} under Hu Jintao today, [the role of military force
has been correspondingly downgraded]{.underline} in terms of prominence,
although by no means abandoned. This change is largely tactical, since
Beijing's ultimate goal of eventual re-unification under the one China
principle remains unchanged.¶ Reasons for the change in policy approach
have never been formally disclosed by Beijing. Nevertheless, reasonable
speculation is possible. On the one hand, [military
exercises]{.underline} in the 1995-96 Taiwan Strait crisis
[and]{.underline} the [hawkish remarks]{.underline} made by Premier Zhu
Rongji immediately before Taiwan's 2000 Presidential election all
[backfired]{.underline}, and Taiwan people were alienated despite the
fact that a trend for "Taiwan independence" did not come about. The
backfiring of a forceful policy by Beijing could be seen as early as in
the landslide victory of Lee Teng-hui in Taiwan's 1996 Presidential
election.¶ On the other hand, [China's diplomatic environment also
suffered from its forceful approach]{.underline} to Taiwan in the late
1990s. [The "China threat" theory emerged as a result of the hawkish
behaviour exhibited by the PLA]{.underline}, and this served to isolate
China by encouraging the US to develop closer security ties with Taiwan
and to strengthen the US-Japan alliance. It was also detrimental to
China's goal of building better relations with its neighbouring
countries, particularly those in Southeast Asia.¶ As such, [the hardline
policy had largely failed to achieve its aims, and had to be
changed]{.underline}. This change coincided with the transition from
Jiang Zemin to Hu Jintao. (18) As the leading figure of the fourth
generation of CCP leaders, Hu took control over the party, state, and
military step-by-step from Jiang between the years 2002 and 2005. During
this period, Taiwan-China relations also embarked on a new trajectory
with the revival of CCP-KMT cooperation marked by the visit of then-KMT
chairman Lien Chan to China in 2005. (19) The completion of Beijing's
power transition and Lien's visit China represented a milestone in terms
of China's military posture in its Taiwan policy, allowing China to move
Taiwan policy from a hard to a soft approach, while still refusing to
abandon the option of using military means against Taiwan in order to
block Taiwan independence.¶ For instance, Hu's keynote speech before the
17th Party Congress in 2007 greatly soft-pedalled the Taiwan issue, and
did not mention the mantra of opposing Taiwan's independence and two
Chinas. (20) Again, in his Political Report at the 17th Party Congress,
Hu offered Taiwan the opportunity to negotiate a peace accord. (21) The
changes in China's approach toward Taiwan under Hu laid the foundation
for the later dramatic improved atmosphere in cross-Strait relations.
There are several significant dimensions worth noting in the shift in
China's Taiwan policy since the Jiang-Hu transition of leadership.¶
Militarily, [Beijing reduced its public emphasis on the potential use of
force against Taiwan]{.underline}. Military tension flared up three
times during the Jiang era in 1995, 1996, and 1999. By contrast, no such
incidents have happened under Hu Jintao. Instead, [Beijing has stressed
non-military approaches to deal with Taiwan, and in a sense, Beijing has
adjusted its means to influence Taiwan softly and
comprehensively]{.underline}. For instance, the much-touted Dongshan
Island military exercises previously held annually near the Taiwan
Strait ceased in 2005, after having been scaled down in 2004. In
response, Taipei announced the cancellation of the Han Kuang drill
scheduled for 9 September 2004. (22) Further, PLA amphibious and
airborne exercises perceived as simulated attacks on Taiwan have been
held elsewhere, a step aimed at reducing the provocative nature of the
drills.¶ This does not mean Beijing has given up the military approach,
but rather that it prefers to stress softer approaches, even while still
regarding the use of force as a last option. In 2007, [Hu pointed out
that]{.underline} the main mission of the PLA is to win a war with
Taiwan, but also noted that [attacking the island would cause several
negative results]{.underline}, including damaging economic development
along China's southeast coast, impairing Beijing's foreign relations,
harming foreign investment in China, causing causalities, and pushing
back the progress of China's national modernisation. (23)¶ Although Hu
proclaimed the tough-sounding "Anti-Secession Law" (ASL) (24) in 2005 to
guard against the prospect of a declaration of Taiwan independence, and
although the law was widely perceived as a step toward preparing the
legal grounds for war against Taiwan, the law was actually meant more as
a step to unshackle the hands of China's Taiwan affairs experts to
promote cross-Strait engagement free from hawkish internal opposition
than as an attempt to intimidate Taiwan, even if Taiwan was further
antagonised and alienated as a result. In other words, the ratification
of the ASL served two goals: it sought to hold off any potential
criticism of Hu's new Taiwan policy on the one hand, while at the same
time attempting to buy time for a new approach aimed at winning the
hearts and minds of Taiwanese people for the ultimate goal of political
re-unification.¶ Hu's new Taiwan policy could also be demonstrated in
his handling of Beijing-Washington-Taipei relations. The new approach
has been to restrain Taiwan's independence via Washington
diplomatically, rather than to constrain Taipei directly and militarily.
This was in sharp contrast to the Jiang Zemin era, during which
Beijing's sensitivity to Taiwan separatism led it to launch missile
tests in the Taiwan Strait before the Taiwan presidential election in
1996. By contrast, Hu Jintao looked to Washington to rein in behaviour
by Taiwan that it considered destabilising.¶ For instance, during the
2004 presidential election campaign, Beijing unexpectedly did not resort
to military intimidation or even verbal attacks. Rather, as Chen
stressed Taiwan independence and referendum issues on several occasions,
Beijing encouraged Washington to admonish him while remaining silent
itself. This change reflected the increased importance China has
assigned to the US in its approach to constraining Taiwan. Beijing has
changed its policy vis-à-vis Taipei from acting directly across the
Strait to acting on Taipei indirectly through pressure exerted by
Washington.¶ Hu Jintao's changed approach toward Taiwan could be
observed in other areas as well. In the white paper China's National
Defense in 2008 released on 20 January 2009, (25) more than six months
after Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九) took office, Beijing
stressed that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have made progress in
consultations under the common political framework of the "1992
Consensus." (26) China took a further step in its 2010 defence white
paper, which proposed that Taipei and Beijing initiate talks about a
"military security trust mechanism." (27)¶ Briefly, under Hu Jintao,
[China's approach to Taiwan has become decidedly more patient and less
aggressive in response to Taiwan's de-emphasising of the independence
issue. Beijing's attitude nowadays is softer, more proactive, and more
flexible in engaging Taiwan economically, socially, and
culturally]{.underline}. This has greatly reduced Taiwanese analysts'
perceptions of threat from mainland China.

[[Military leaders **regularly inflate threats**]{.mark} or warn of the
**armed forces** becoming **hollow**]{.underline} and unable to maintain
its competitive ad- vantage vis-å-vis other countries in order [[to
justify the Pentagon\'s]{.mark} nearly **[\$700 billion]{.mark} annual
[budget]{.mark}**]{.underline}. \"I\'d love to see the budget go down,\"
secretary of defense James Mattis told Congress in April 2018, but with
\"the world that we\'re looking at out there, I don\'t think that\'s
going to be the case.\" In reality, [[**no military leader wants** to
see]{.underline}]{.mark} his or [[her **budget decrease**, which
means]{.mark} that the **[threats]{.mark} facing America** are **[always
severe]{.mark}.**]{.underline}2

[[**Military contractors**]{.mark} that [are **deeply reliant on defense
spending**]{.mark} and **[think tank]{.mark}er[s]{.mark}** who [increase
attention paid to their issues by reporting them in **alarmist
terms**]{.mark}]{.underline}---and ignoring positive global
trends---[**lend a hand** as well. The media]{.underline} endorses, and
even **[cultivates]{.underline}**, [**the notion** that America faces
**serious threats** because such stories]{.underline} sell newspapers,
**[get more viewers]{.underline}**, and lead to more clicks. \"If it
bleeds it leads\" is true not only of local crime reporting but of
international coverage too.

**[Activists]{.underline}**, human rights groups, national
[**[lobbies]{.mark}**, and **cybersecurity firms** play their part by
[present]{.mark}ing the [issues they work on **as**]{.mark} **potential
[threats]{.mark}** so as [to]{.mark} ensure they [receive]{.mark}
**heightened**]{.underline} media and **[[policy-maker
attention]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As Stephen Walt, the noted
international re- lations scholar at Harvard University, succinctly put
it a few years ago, \"[[Whether the issue is]{.underline}]{.mark} Cuba,
Darfur, [[the **Middle** **East**]{.underline}]{.mark}, Armenia,

[represents]{.mark}]{.underline} what we call [[the **Threat-Industrial

to the \"**military- industrial complex**\"]{.underline} and \"its
acquisition of unwarranted influence\' that President Dwight D.
Eisenhower famously warned of in his fare- well address in January 1961.
Like the group that Eisenhower de- scribed then, the TIC is not
clandestinely plotting behind closed doors in hidden mountain lairs. It
is not a club that its members sign up for or pay yearly dues to.
Neither is this far-flung group part of a secret or deliberate
conspiracy to shape public perceptions---though it certainly has that
effect.4

Rather, [[the TIC]{.mark} shares interests,]{.underline} objectives,
[and]{.underline} perhaps, above all, [a]{.underline}n inherent and
**[self-interested pessimism]{.underline}** about the global
environment. These collective yet uncoordinated [efforts [have]{.mark} a
[**tremendous influence** on the way Americans **think about

#### Ethical policymaking requires calculation of consequences

**Gvosdev, St. Antony's College Rhodes Scholar PhD, 2005**

(Nikolas, "The Value(s) of Realism", SAIS Review of International
Affairs, 25.1, project muse)

As the name implies, realists focus on promoting policies that are
achievable and sustainable. In turn, [[the morality of
a]{.underline}]{.mark} foreign [[policy]{.underline}]{.mark} action [[is
judged by its results, not]{.underline}]{.mark} by the
[[intentions]{.underline}]{.mark} of its framers. [A]{.underline}
foreign [[policymaker must weigh the consequences of
any]{.underline}]{.mark} course of [[action]{.mark} and assess the
resources at hand]{.underline} to carry out the proposed task. As
Lippmann warned, Without the controlling principle that the nation must
maintain its objectives and its power in equilibrium, its purposes
within its means and its means equal to its purposes, its commitments
related to its resources and its resources adequate to its commitments,
it is impossible to think at all about foreign affairs.8 Commenting on
this maxim, Owen Harries, founding editor of The National Interest,
noted, \"This is a truth of which Americans---more apt to focus on ends
rather than means when it comes to dealing with the rest of the
world---need always to be reminded.\"9 In fact, Morgenthau noted that
\"there can be no political morality without prudence.\"10 This virtue
of prudence---which Morgenthau identified as the cornerstone of
realism---should not be confused with expediency. Rather, it takes as
its starting point that [[it is more moral]{.underline}]{.mark} to
fulfill one\'s commitments than to make \"empty\" promises, and [[to
seek solutions that minimize harm and produce sustainable
results]{.underline}]{.mark}. Morgenthau concluded: \[End Page 18\]
Political realism does not require, nor does it condone, indifference to
political ideals and moral principles, but it requires indeed a sharp
distinction between the desirable and the possible, between what is
desirable everywhere and at all times and what is possible [under the
concrete circumstances of time and place]{.underline}.11 This is why,
prior to the outbreak of fighting in the former Yugoslavia, U.S. and
European realists urged that Bosnia be decentralized and partitioned
into ethnically based cantons as a way to head off a destructive civil
war. Realists felt this would be the best course of action, especially
after the country\'s first free and fair elections had brought
nationalist candidates to power at the expense of those calling for
inter-ethnic cooperation. They had concluded---correctly, as it turned
out---that the United States and Western Europe would be unwilling to
invest the blood and treasure that would be required to craft a unitary
Bosnian state and give it the wherewithal to function. Indeed, at a
diplomatic conference in Lisbon in March 1992, the various factions in
Bosnia had, reluctantly, endorsed the broad outlines of such a
settlement. For the purveyors of moralpolitik, this was unacceptable.
After all, for this plan to work, populations on the \"wrong side\" of
the line would have to be transferred and resettled. Such a plan struck
directly at the heart of the concept of multi-ethnicity---that different
ethnic and religious groups could find a common political identity and
work in common institutions. When the United States signaled it would
not accept such a settlement, the fragile consensus collapsed. The
United States, of course, cannot be held responsible for the war; this
lies squarely on the shoulders of Bosnia\'s political leaders. Yet
Washington fell victim to what Jonathan Clarke called \"faux
Wilsonianism,\" [[the belief that]{.underline}]{.mark} \"high-flown
[[words matter more than rational calculation]{.mark}\" in
formulating]{.underline} effective [policy]{.underline}, which [[led
U.S]{.underline}.]{.mark} policymakers [[to dispense
with]{.underline}]{.mark} the equation of \"[[balancing commitments and
resources]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"12 Indeed, as he notes, the
[Clinton]{.underline} administration had [criticized peace plans
[calling]{.mark} for]{.underline} decentralized [partition [in
Bosnia]{.mark} \"with lofty rhetoric without proposing a practical
alternative.\" [The subsequent war led to the deaths
of]{.mark}]{.underline} tens of [[thousands]{.underline}]{.mark} and
left more than a million people homeless. After three years of war, the
Dayton Accords---hailed as a triumph of American diplomacy---created a
complicated arrangement by which the federal union of two ethnic units,
the Muslim-Croat Federation, was itself federated to a Bosnian Serb
republic. Today, Bosnia requires thousands of foreign troops to patrol
its internal borders and billions of dollars in foreign aid to keep its
government and economy functioning. Was the aim of U.S. policymakers,
academics and journalists---creating a multi-ethnic democracy in
Bosnia---not worth pursuing? No, not at all, and this is not what the
argument suggests. But aspirations were not matched with capabilities.
[[As a result of holding out for the \"most moral\"
outcome]{.underline}]{.mark} and encouraging the Muslim-led government
in Sarajevo to pursue maximalist aims [rather than finding a workable
compromise that could have avoided bloodshed]{.underline} and produced
more stable conditions, the peoples of [[Bosnia suffered
greatly]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the end, [the final settlement was very
close]{.underline} \[End Page 19\] [to the one]{.underline} that
realists had [initially]{.underline} proposed---and the one that had
also been roundly [condemned on moral grounds.]{.underline}

### Util

#### Utilitarianism is the only ethical way to evaluate action because it is indifferent to temporal distance. 

**Davidson 15** (Marc D. Davidson, researcher and lecturer, University
of Amsterdam environmental ethics and economics "Climate change and the
ethics of discounting" WIREs Clim Change 2015, 6:401--412. doi:
10.1002/wcc.347 *.nt)*

Welfarist Consequentialism Utilitarianism The most common approach to
discounting in the climate debate is (classical) utilitarianism.
According to **[[utilitarianism,]{.mark} the right act is the one that
[maximizes utility]{.mark}]{.underline}** (or happiness, well-being, or
some other comparable measure) **[for all concerned]{.underline}**.
**[Th[e utilitarian approach has two consequences for
discounting]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The first of these is that **[[time
as such is irrelevant]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Sidgwick,61 one of the
founding fathers of utilitarianism, already observed that '**[[the
interests of posterity must concern a Utilitarian]{.mark} as much as
those of his \[their\] contemporaries]{.underline}**.' In other words:
**[changes in future utility count as much as changes in
present]{.underline}** utility.c The second consequence is that,
**[given the diminishing marginal utility of consumption, [discounting
is indeed required if future generations are expected to be wealthier
than we are today]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}d According to
Marshall,64 'a pound's worth of satisfaction to an ordinary poor man is
a much greater thing than a pound's worth of satisfaction to an ordinary
rich man.' According to utilitarianism, we should therefore discount
future climate damage at a rate equal to the expected growth rate of
consumption times the absolute value of the elasticity of marginal
utility: the Ramsey formula with the pure rate of time preference set to
zero. This is the approach followed by e.g., Ramsey,20 Pigou,56, and
Harrod65 in the general discounting debate and by e.g., Cline,32
Schelling,53 Azar & Sterner,66 Broome,67,68, and Stern6 in the climate
debate.

#### Extinction outweighs\-\--any risk is a reason to err neg 

Seth D. **Baum and** Anthony M. **Barrett 18**. Global Catastrophic Risk
Institute. 2018. "Global Catastrophes: The Most Extreme Risks." Risk in
Extreme Environments: Preparing, Avoiding, Mitigating, and Managing,
edited by Vicki Bier, Routledge, pp. 174--184.

2\. What Is GCR And Why Is It Important? [Taken **literally**, a global
catastrophe can be any event that is in some way catastrophic across the
globe]{.underline}. [This suggests a rather low threshold]{.underline}
for what counts as a global catastrophe. An event causing just one death
on each continent (say, from a jet-setting assassin) could rate as a
global catastrophe, because surely these deaths would be catastrophic
for the deceased and their loved ones. [However, in common usage, a
global catastrophe would be **catastrophic** for a significant portion
of the globe]{.underline}. Minimum thresholds have variously been set
around ten thousand to ten million deaths or \$10 billion to \$10
trillion in damages (Bostrom and Ćirković 2008), or death of one quarter
of the human population (Atkinson 1999; Hempsell 2004). [Others have
emphasized catastrophes that cause **long-term declines in the
trajectory of human civilization**]{.underline} (Beckstead 2013), [that
human civilization **does not recover from**]{.underline} (Maher and
Baum 2013), [that drastically reduce humanity's potential for future
achievements]{.underline} ([Bostrom]{.underline} 2002, [using the term
"**existential risk**"), or that result in **human
extinction**]{.underline} (Matheny 2007; Posner 2004). [A common theme
across all these treatments of GCR is that **[some]{.mark}
[catastrophes]{.mark} [are vastly more important than
others]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Carl Sagan was perhaps the first to
recognize this, in his commentary on nuclear winter (Sagan 1983).
[Without nuclear winter, a global nuclear war might kill several hundred
million people. This is obviously a major catastrophe, but humanity
would presumably carry on. However, with **nuclear
winter**]{.underline}, per Sagan, [**[humanity]{.mark} [could go
extinct]{.mark}**. The loss would be not just an additional four billion
or so deaths, but the [loss of **all future
generations**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} To paraphrase Sagan, [the
loss would be billions and billions of lives, or even
**more**]{.underline}. [Sagan estimated **[500 trillion lives]{.mark}**,
assuming humanity would continue for ten million more years, which he
cited as typical for a successful species. Sagan's 500 trillion number
[may]{.mark} even [be an **underestimate**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
analysis here takes an adventurous turn, hinging on the evolution of the
human species and the long-term fate of the universe. On these long time
scales, the descendants of contemporary humans may no longer be
recognizably "human". The issue then is whether the descendants are
still worth caring about, whatever they are. If they are, then it begs
the question of how many of them there will be. Barring major global
catastrophe, Earth will remain habitable for about one billion more
years 2 until the Sun gets too warm and large. The rest of the Solar
System, Milky Way galaxy, universe, and (if it exists) the multiverse
will remain habitable for a lot longer than that (Adams and Laughlin
1997), should our descendants gain the capacity to migrate there. [An
open question in astronomy is whether it is possible for the descendants
of humanity to continue living for an **infinite length of time** or
instead merely an **astronomically large but finite** length of
time]{.underline} (see e.g. Ćirković 2002; Kaku 2005). Either way, [the
stakes with global catastrophes **could** be **much larger than the loss
of 500 trillion lives.** Debates about the infinite vs. the merely
astronomical are of theoretical interest]{.underline} (Ng 1991; Bossert
et al. 2007), [but they have **limited practical significance**. This
can be seen when **evaluating GCRs from a standard
[risk-equals-probability-times-magnitude]{.mark} framework**. Using
Sagan's 500 trillion lives estimate, it follows that reducing the
probability of global catastrophe by a mere one-in-500-trillion chance
is of the same significance as saving one human life. Phrased
differently, [society should **try 500 trillion times harder to
prevent**]{.mark} **a [global catastrophe]{.mark} [than]{.mark} it
should [to save a person's life]{.mark}**. Or, preventing one million
deaths is equivalent to a one-in500-million reduction in the probability
of global catastrophe. This suggests society should **make extremely
large investment in GCR reduction, at the expense of virtually all other
objectives.**]{.underline} Judge and legal scholar Richard Posner made a
similar point in monetary terms (Posner 2004). Posner used \$50,000 as
the value of a statistical human life (VSL) and 12 billion humans as the
total loss of life (double the 2004 world population); he describes both
figures as significant underestimates. Multiplying them gives \$600
trillion as an underestimate of the value of preventing global
catastrophe. For comparison, the United States government typically uses
a VSL of around one to ten million dollars (Robinson 2007). Multiplying
a \$10 million VSL with 500 trillion lives gives \$5x1021 as the value
of preventing global catastrophe. But even using "just\" \$600 trillion,
[society should be willing to spend]{.underline} at least that much to
prevent a global catastrophe, which converts to being willing to spend
at least [\$1 million for a one-in-500-million reduction in the
probability of global catastrophe]{.underline}. Thus [while reasonable
disagreement exists on how large of a VSL to use and how much to count
future generations, even low-end positions suggest **vast resource
allocations** should be redirected to reducing GCR. This conclusion is
only **strengthened** when considering the **astronomical size of the
stakes**]{.underline}, but the same point holds either way. The bottom
line is that, [as long as something along the lines of the standard
riskequals-probability-times-magnitude framework is being used, then
**even tiny GCR reductions** merit significant effort. This point holds
especially strongly for risks of catastrophes that would cause
**permanent harm to global human civilization**. The discussion thus far
has assumed that all human lives are valued equally. This assumption is
**not universally held**]{.underline}. [People often value some people
more than others]{.underline}, favoring themselves, their family and
friends, their compatriots, their generation, or others whom they
identify with. [Great debates rage on across moral philosophy,
economics, and other fields about how much people should value
others]{.underline} who are distant in space, time, or social relation,
as well as the unborn members of future generations. [This debate is
crucial]{.underline} for all valuations of risk, including GCR. Indeed,
if each of us only cares about our immediate selves, then global
catastrophes may not be especially important, and we probably have
better things to do with our time than worry about them. [[While
everyone has the right to their **own views**]{.mark} **and
feelings**]{.underline}, we find that [[the strongest arguments are for
the **widely held position** that **all human lives should be valued
equally**]{.mark}.]{.underline} This position is succinctly stated in
the United States Declaration of Independence, updated in the 1848
Declaration of Sentiments: "We hold these truths to be self-evident:
that all men and 3 women are created equal". [[Philosophers speak of
a]{.mark}n agent-neutral, objective "view from nowhere"]{.underline}
(Nagel 1986) [or [a "veil of ignorance"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Rawls
1971) [[in which each]{.mark} person [considers what is best for society
**irrespective of which member**]{.mark} **of society [they happen to
be]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Such a perspective **suggests [valuing
everyone equally]{.mark}**, regardless of who they are or where or when
they live. This in turn [suggests a **very high value for reducing
GCR**]{.mark}, or a high degree of priority for GCR reduction
efforts.]{.underline}

### Intervening Actors

#### Evaluating intervening actors is key -- moral posturing precludes solvency

**Bracey, 8** -- (Christopher A. Bracey, Associate Professor of Law,
Associate Professor of African & African American Studies, Washington
University in St. Louis, September 2006, Southern California Law Review,
79 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1231, p. 1318)

Second, [reducing conversation on race]{.underline} matters [to an
ideological contest allows opponents to elide inquiry into whether the
results of a particular preference policy are desirable. [Policy
positions masquerading as]{.mark}]{.underline} principled
**[[ideological stances create the impression that]{.mark} a [racial
policy is not simply a choice among]{.mark} available [alternatives, but
the embodiment of some higher moral principle]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Thus, [[the \"principle\" becomes an end in itself, without reference to
outcomes]{.mark}. Consider the prevailing view of colorblindness in
constitutional discourse. Colorblindness has come to be understood as
the embodiment of what is morally just]{.underline}, independent of its
actual effect upon the lives of racial minorities. This explains Justice
Thomas\'s belief in the \"moral and constitutional equivalence\" between
Jim Crow laws and race preferences, and his tragic assertion that
\"Government cannot make us equal \[but\] can only recognize, respect,
and protect us as equal before the law.\"
[281](http://web.lexis-nexis.com/universe/document?_m=cd9713b340d60abd42c2b34c36d8ef95&_docnum=9&wchp=dGLbVzz-zSkVA&_md5=9645fa92f5740655bdc1c9ae7c82b328#n281)
For Thomas, there is no meaningful difference between laws designed to
entrench racial subordination and those designed to alleviate conditions
of oppression. [Critics may point out that colorblindness in practice
has the effect of entrenching existing racial disparities in health,
wealth, and society. But in framing the debate in purely ideological
terms, opponents are able to avoid the contentious issue of outcomes and
make viability determinations based exclusively on whether racially
progressive measures exude fidelity to the ideological principle of
colorblindness. [Meaningful policy debate is replaced by ideological
exchange, which further exacerbates hostilities and deepens the cycle of
resentment.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Magnitude 

#### Magnitude is key\-\--probability focus is anti-democratic\-\--the [illusion]{.underline} of objectively low risk is used to dismiss legitimate public concerns and conceal uncertainty

K. S. **Shrader-Frechette 91**, O\'Neill Family Professor, Department of
Biological Sciences and Department of Philosophy, at the University of
Notre Dame, Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Notre Dame, Risk
and Rationality: Philosophical Foundations for Populist Reforms, p 90-98

[There are]{.underline}, however, [a number of reasons for arguing
that]{.underline}, in certain cases, **[risk [consequences are more
important than]{.mark}]{.underline}** the accident **[[proba-
bilities]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For one thing, [greater social
disruption arises from one massive accident than]{.underline} from [a
number of single-fatality]{.underline} accident[s]{.underline}, even
though the same number of people may be killed. The law of torts also
rec- ognizes the heightened importance of high-consequence events, apart
from their probability of occurrence. In fact, for the rule of strict
lia- bility, risk is based almost totally on grave potential
consequences, re- gardless of the associated probability.S2 Part of the
justification for this judicial emphasis on accident consequences is
apparently the fact that the parties involved in litigation over
catastrophic accidents---the in- jured persons and those liable for the
injury---are not equal in bar- gaining power.\" The representative of
some technological or industrial interest usually has more clout than
the person damaged by it. More- over, as Chapter Twelve will argue in
more detail, a person is more deserving of compensation according to
strict liability when she is vic- timized by an impact that she did not
voluntarily accept or help to create. For all these reasons, societal
risk evaluation of potentially cata- strophic technologies ought to
focus on the accident consequences as well as on their probabilities. ¶
This point is clear if one [[consider]{.mark}s]{.underline} a rational
response to the invi- tation to play [[Russian Roulette]{.mark}. Suppose
the probability that a bullet is in a chamber when the trigger is pulled
is]{.underline} I in [same]{.underline} like- lihood, [per]{.underline}
reactor-[year]{.underline}, as a nuclear core melt. [[Even
with]{.underline}]{.mark} such [a [small probability, a person
could]{.mark} still [be rational in her refusal to play]{.mark} the
game**. [She could]{.mark} even [maintain]{.mark} that [the]{.mark}
[probability]{.mark} in question [is ir- relevant. Any probability of
fatality might be too high]{.mark}**]{.underline} if the benefits
deriving from taking the risk were not great enough. [And if so, then
probabilities might not be as important, in]{.underline} environmental
[risk evalua- tion, as proponents of the probabilistic strategy
suggest]{.underline}. As one expert expressed it, current debate over
whether a given technology has a particular risk probability is a
spurious issue. \"Risk assessors tend to choose methods and data that
support the position to which they are already committed.\"S4 If so,
then debate over environmental risks is likely to be over many factors
other than probability. ¶ Probabilities Are Often Uncertain ¶ The [claim
[that]{.mark}]{.underline} probabilities are central to risk evaluation,
and that \"the [bulk of [disagreement\" over **environmental hazards**
has been caused by]{.mark}]{.underline} \"[[**intuitive estimates** of
**unreasonably high risk**]{.underline}]{.mark},\" also [errs in
[ignor]{.mark}ing **[reasonable disagreement over]{.mark} risk
[probabilities.]{.mark}** [Risk assessment has been]{.mark} repeatedly
criticized as [an \"**arcane expert process**]{.mark}\"]{.underline}
that is over- dependent on probability estimates of assessors.S5 Many
risk assessors appear to believe that it is \"perfectly valid to base
public policy on expert estimates and data,\" but that, once a risk
expert has spoken, any dis- agreement is unreasonable and intuitive\"
Such a notion is doubly ques- tionable. ¶ It is in part implausible
because it presupposes a far more objective picture of probabilistic
risk data than is now available. Even the authors of the most complete
hazard analysis ever accomplished, WASH-1400, cautioned that their
probability estimates were deficient, unprovable, possibly incomplete,
assumption laden, and saddled with \"an appre- ciable uncertainty.\"
They said that \"the present state of knowledge probably will not permit
a complete analysis Of low-probability accidents in nuclear plants with
the precision that would be desirable.\' \'37 More generally and more
recently, risk assessors have pointed out that \"un- certainties of six
orders of magnitude are not unusual\" in any proba- bilistic risk
analysis.S8 In the face of such caveats, alleged certitude about which
risk probabilities are correct, and which are incorrect, may be
doubtful. As this chapter has noted, often the scientific mechanisms
causing a hazard are unknown, as in the case of methylene chloride.39
And, as the previous chapter also argued, accident probability often
can- not be determined on the basis of observed accident frequency.40 On
the one hand, very low values of an accident probability per LNG trip,
or per reactor-year, for example, are consistent with an assumed record
of zero accidents in 800 voyages, or zero core melts in 17,000 reactor-
years. On the other hand, an annual accident probability as high as I in
100 or I in 200 would still be consistent with the current LNG
accident-frequency record, just as a yearly probability as high as I in
2,000 would be consistent with the existing record for nuclear
accidents. Even though an accident record may be consistent with very
low risk- probability values, this frequency alone \"does not prove that
the values are low.wu ¶ [Proponents]{.underline} of the probabilistic
strategy also err, in emphasizing risk probabilities, because they [are
unable to account for the reasonable controversy]{.underline}---among
Nobel Prize winners, the American Physical So- ciety, the Environmental
Protection Agency, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the American
Nuclear Society---over various risk probabilities .42 Reputable
assessors affirm that many of the most serious environmental risks, such
as global warming from burning Of fossil fuels, are \"highly resistant
to quantification.\"\" Moreover. for a number of reasons, nuclear
probabilities, for example, are especially resistant to accurate
estimation. Compound events, sequential component fail- ures, sabotage
or human error, and weapons proliferation are not ame- nable to
quantification.\" Rasmussen computed the probability of having a Three
Mile Island type of accident as anywhere from I in 250 to 1 in 25,000
reactor-years.\" All this suggests that certain accidents are not really
\"impossible,\" because many low probabilities are not be- lievable. For
example, the probability for a royal flush is I in 464,000. Yet, in a
card game the probability is actually much higher, since the probability
of cheating is likely to be as high as I in 10,000. Likewise, although
the probability of a given environmental or technological ac- cident may
be only very slight, the higher probability of sabotage or terrorism is
likely to increase this number by several orders of mag- nitude. Real
risks, then, are likely to include so-called \"outrageous events\" or
\"rogue events,\" which are difficult to handle in probabilistic risk
assessment.46 Indeed, human error causes a majority of most in-
dustrial, marine, and transportation accidents.47 ¶ [[In claiming that
the public **overestimates**]{.mark} many [risk probabilities,
such]{.mark} as those [for **nuclear accidents**]{.mark}]{.underline},
many assessors assume that, in some of the most controversial, untested,
and potentially catastrophic areas of technology, it is possible to
judge clearly when a risk probability is accurate and when it is not.
This is an appeal to authority, an appeal that (given the history of
science) simply does not hold up. ¶ Risk assessors\' emphasis on the
importance of probability estimates is especially vulnerable because the
characteristics that, according to various experts, influence judgments
Of perceived and acceptable risks are highly intercorrelated;
involuntary hazards, for example, \"tend also to be inequitable and
catastrophic.\" 48 Therefore, as noted in Chapter Six, it is especially
difficult to determine whether society\'s expressed concern about
involuntary risks, for example, is merely an artifact Of the high
correlations between involuntariness and other undesirable risk
characteristics. There are numerous allegedly causal explanations, all
consistent with the same \"observed\" phenomena. Kasper makes an
analogous observation: ¶ Even the best of epidemiological studies is
confounded by the myriad expla- nations for low-level neurobehavioral
effects; the same effects attributed to lead may be caused by exlx»sure
to low levels of many other trace metals, and indeed by exposure to the
pace and stress of urban life itself. The result is that careful studies
yield not proof but only suggestions.\" ¶ Or, as Cox and Ricci put it,
\"multiple models, having quite different implications at low doses, may
all adequately \'fit\' the observed dose- response data.\"50 ¶ Precisely
because their hypothesis about misperceived probabilities is consistent
with other explanations, proponents of the probabilistic strategy are
not warranted in singling out the public\'s alleged misper- ceived
probabilities as the cause of its high aversion to societal risks.
Rather, as the previous chapter argued, the distinction between expert/
objective and lay/subjective determination Of environmental risks will
not hold up. Because of problems of actual risk calculation (prior to
any alleged evaluation), many hazard estimates are merely the intui-
tive gues.ses of individuals. Authors of a recent study conducted at the
Stanford Research Institute admitted, for example, that analytic tech-
niques could not handle probability estimates for certain human-caused
events. They concluded: \' \'We must rely on expert judgment,
quantified, using subjective probabilities.\' \'51 Likewise, the loss of
the astronauts in e Challenger disaster, as well as the death of three
astronauts on the ground at Cape Kennedy, demonstrated that even the
best systems- analytic approaches cannot anticipate every possibility.
In fact, one of the most famous nuclear risk probabilities, widely
touted as \"objective,\" highly value laden. This is the reactor-year
probability of a core melt in a nuclear plant, I in 17,000. As defended
in WASH-1400, this proba-bility is notoriously laden with value
judgments about the effectiveness of evacuation in the face of
catastrophe, the probability of weather stability, and the Gaussian
Plume rise of radioactivity.52 The problem, however, is not that such
\"objective\" probabilities (as given by experts) are value laden but
that they are apparently not recognized as such by proponents of the
probabilistic strategy. ¶ Lessons Learned from Experts\' Claims about
Societal Risks ¶ The [[tendency]{.mark} of]{.underline} proponents of
[the **probabilistic strategy**]{.underline} [[to]{.underline}
**[overem- phasize]{.underline}**]{.mark} the [[importance of]{.mark}
risk [probabilities]{.mark} and]{.underline} to condemn the public\'s
alleged \"misperceptions\" of societal risks reveals an important flaw
in contemporary environmental risk analysis. Assessors presume that, if
there is a public preference for a risk whose probability of fatality is
statistically higher than that of an alternative, then this preference
is a result of misperceived probabilities, not a legitimate value
system.5S Their failure to recognize the value components of allegedly
objective probability estimates [[goes **hand in hand**]{.underline}
[with]{.underline}]{.mark} assessors\' [[tendencies to define
ethical]{.mark} and political [issues as **merely technical**]{.mark}
**ones**]{.underline}, as the naive positivists are prone to do.\"\'
They assume, incorrectly, that agreement about technical matters is
sufficient for resolving normative disputes. Apparently, they make this
assumption because they are afraid of damaging \"the scientific
pretenses of their work.\"55 As a consequence, their
[[emphasis]{.underline}]{.mark} on the importance of abstract,
\"objective\" science [[helps]{.underline}]{.mark} both to
[**[disguise]{.underline}** [the]{.underline}]{.mark} often
[[exploitative way]{.mark} in which technology is used
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} to condone a passive acceptance of the status
quo. It allows asses- sors to **[[dismiss as irrational or
unscientific]{.underline}]{.mark}** (as Okrent, Starr, Whipple, Maxey,
Cohen, Lee, and others have done) [[any attempts to challenge
our]{.underline}]{.mark} contemporary ethical or political
[[values]{.underline}]{.mark}\" But, as Dickson has ar- gued, \"the use
Of supposedly objective models Of social behavior serves to legitimate
the imposition of social policy,\" because [the [**real risk concerns**
of laypersons can]{.mark}]{.underline} then **[[be dismissed as
subjective]{.underline}]{.mark}**.57 As one critic puts it, this is
\"like playing Monopoly with the Mafia: they always start the game
owning Boardwalk.\"58

### Predictions Good

#### [They're wrong]{.underline} about predictions and voting for them makes it worse

**Fitzsimmons, 7** -- Ph.D. in international security policy from the
University of Maryland, Adjunct Professor of Public Policy, analyst in
the Strategy, Forces, and Resources Division at the Institute for
Defense Analyses (Michael, "The Problem of Uncertainty in Strategic
Planning", Survival, Winter 06/07)

In defence of prediction Uncertainty is not a new phenomenon for
strategists. Clausewitz knew that 'many intelligence reports in war are
contradictory; even more are false, and most are uncertain'. In coping
with uncertainty, he believed that 'what one can reasonably ask of an
officer is that he should possess a standard of judgment, which he can
gain only from knowledge of men and affairs and from common sense. He
should be guided by the laws of probability.'34 Granted, one can
certainly allow for epistemological debates about the best ways of
gaining 'a standard of judgment' from 'knowledge of men and affairs and
from common sense'. Scientific inquiry into the 'laws of probability'
for any given strate- gic question may not always be possible or
appropriate. Certainly, analysis cannot and should not be presumed to
trump the intuition of decision-makers. Nevertheless, Clausewitz's
implication seems to be that [[the **burden of proof**]{.mark} in any
debates about planning [should belong to the decision-maker who
rejects]{.mark} formal analysis, standards of evidence and
[probabilistic reasoning]{.mark}]{.underline}. Ultimately, though, [the
value of prediction in strategic planning does not rest primarily in
getting the correct answer]{.underline}, or even in the more feasible
objective of bounding the range of correct answers.
[Rather,]{.underline} [[prediction requires decision-makers to
expose]{.mark}, not only to others but to themselves, the beliefs they
hold regarding [**why** a given event is likely or]{.mark} unlikely and
why it would be [important]{.mark} or unimportant]{.underline}. Richard
Neustadt and Ernest May highlight this useful property of probabilistic
reasoning in their renowned study of the use of history in
decision-making, Thinking in Time. In discussing the importance of
probing presumptions, they contend: The need is for tests prompting
questions, for sharp, straightforward mechanisms the decision makers and
their aides might readily recall and use to dig into their own and each
others' presumptions. And they need tests that get at basics somewhat by
indirection, not by frontal inquiry: not 'what is your inferred
causation, General?' Above all, not, 'what are your values, Mr.
Secretary?' \... If someone says 'a fair chance' \... ask, 'if you were
a betting man or woman, what odds would you put on that?' If others are
present, ask the same of each, and of yourself, too. Then probe the
differences: why? This is tantamount to seeking and then arguing
assumptions underlying different numbers placed on a subjective
probability assessment. We know of no better way to force clarification
of meanings while exposing hidden differences \... Once differing odds
have been quoted, the question 'why?' can follow any number of tracks.
Argument may pit common sense against common sense or analogy against
analogy. What is important is that the expert's basis for linking 'if'
with 'then' gets exposed to the hearing of other experts before the lay
official has to say yes or no.'35 There are at least three critical and
related benefits of prediction in strate- gic planning. The first
reflects Neustadt and May's point -- [[prediction enforces]{.mark} a
certain level of discipline in [making explicit the assumptions]{.mark},
key variables [and]{.mark} implied causal [relationships]{.mark} that
constitute decision-makers' beliefs and [that **might otherwise remain
implicit**. Imagine]{.mark},]{.underline} for example, [if Shinseki and
Wolfowitz had been made to assign probabilities to their opposing
expectations [regarding]{.mark} post-war [Iraq. Not only would they have
had to work harder to justify their views, they might have seen]{.mark}
more clearly the substantial chance that [they were wrong]{.mark} and
had to make greater efforts in their planning to prepare for that
contingency]{.underline}. [Secondly, the very process of making the
relevant factors of a decision explicit provides a firm]{.underline}, or
at least transparent[, basis for making choices.]{.underline}
Alternative courses of action can be compared and assessed in like
terms. [Third, the transparency and discipline of [the process]{.mark}
of arriving at the initial strategy [should heighten]{.mark} the
decision-maker's [sensitivity toward changes]{.mark} in the environment
that would suggest the need [for adjustments]{.mark} to that
strategy]{.underline}. [In this way, [prediction enhances]{.mark} rather
than under-mines **[strategic flexibility]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This
defence of prediction does not imply that great stakes should be gambled
on narrow, singular predictions of the future. On the contrary, the
central problem of uncertainty in plan- ning remains that any given
prediction may simply be wrong. Preparations for those eventualities
must be made. Indeed, in many cases, relatively unlikely outcomes could
be enormously consequential, and therefore merit extensive preparation
and investment. In order to navigate this complexity, strategists must
return to the dis- tinction between uncertainty and risk.
[[While]{.mark} the [complexity]{.mark} of the international security
environment [may make it]{.mark} somewhat [resistant]{.mark} to the type
of probabilistic thinking associated with risk, [a risk-oriented
approach seems to be the only viable model]{.mark} for national-security
strategic planning. [The alternative]{.mark} approach, which
categorically denies prediction, [precludes
strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Betts argues, Any assumption that some
knowledge, whether intuitive or explicitly formalized, provides guidance
about what should be done is a presumption that there is reason to
believe the choice will produce a satisfactory outcome -- that is, it is
a prediction, however rough it may be. If there is no hope of discerning
and manipulating causes to produce intended effects, analysts as well as
politicians and generals should all quit and go fishing.36 Unless they
are willing to quit and go fishing, then, strategists must sharpen their
tools of risk assessment. Risk assessment comes in many varieties, but
identification of two key parameters is common to all of them: the
consequences of a harmful event or condition; and the likelihood of that
harmful event or condition occurring. With no perspective on likelihood,
a strategist can have no firm perspective on risk. With no firm
perspective on risk, strategists cannot purposefully discriminate among
alternative choices. Without purposeful choice, there is no strategy.
One of the most widely read books in recent years on the complicated
relation- ship between strategy and uncertainty is Peter Schwartz's work
on scenario-based planning, The Art of the Long View. Schwartz warns
against the hazards faced by leaders who have deterministic habits of
mind, or who deny the difficult implications of uncertainty for
strategic planning. To overcome such tenden- cies, he advocates the use
of alternative future scenarios for the purposes of examining
alternative strategies. His view of scenarios is that their goal is not
to predict the future, but to sensitise leaders to the highly contingent
nature of their decision-making.37 This philosophy has taken root in the
strategic-planning processes in the Pentagon and other parts of the US
government, and properly so. Examination of alternative futures and the
potential effects of surprise on current plans is essential.
Appreciation of uncertainty also has a number of organisational impli-
cations, many of which the national-security establishment is trying to
take to heart, such as encouraging multidisciplinary study and training,
enhancing information sharing, rewarding innovation, and placing a
premium on speed and versatility. The arguments advanced here seek to
take nothing away from these imperatives of planning and operating in an
uncertain environment. But appreciation of uncertainty carries hazards
of its own. [Questioning assumptions is critical, but assumptions must
be made in the end.]{.underline} Clausewitz's 'standard of judgment' for
discriminating among alternatives must be applied. Creative, unbounded
speculation must resolve to choice or else there will be no strategy.
Recent history suggests that [[**unchecked scepticism**]{.mark}
regarding the validity of prediction [can marginalise
analysis]{.mark}]{.underline}, trade significant cost for ambig- uous
benefit, [[empower parochial interests]{.mark} in decision-making, [and
undermine flex]{.mark}ibility]{.underline}. Accordingly, having fully
recognised the need to broaden their strategic-planning aperture,
national-security policymakers would do well now to reinvigorate their
efforts in the messy but indispensable business of predicting the
future.

### Cognitive Bias 

#### Cognitive bias flows neg

[Many kinds of [cognitive bias]{.mark} and other psychological phenomena
[impede efforts at]{.mark} thinking clearly and [dealing]{.mark}
effectively [with existential risk]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[32\] For
example, [use of [the availability heuristic]{.mark} may [create a
"good-story bias"]{.mark} whereby [people evaluate]{.mark} the
plausibility of existential-risk scenarios [on]{.mark} the basis of
[experience,]{.mark} or on how easily the various possibilities spring
to mind. Since [nobody has]{.mark} any real [experience with existential
catastrophe, expectations may be formed]{.mark} instead on the basis of
fictional evidence]{.underline} derived from movies and novels. Such
[fictional exposures are systematically biased in favor of scenarios
that make for entertaining stories]{.underline}. Plotlines may feature a
small band of human protagonists successfully repelling an alien
invasion or a robot army. [[A story in which humankind goes extinct
suddenly]{.mark}---without warning and without being replaced by some
other interesting beings---[is]{.mark} less likely to succeed at the box
office]{.underline} ([although [more likely to happen]{.mark} in
reality]{.underline}).

#### Scope neglect proves our arguments

Eliezer **Yudkowsky 6**. Machine Intelligence Research Institute., 2006
"Cognitive Biases Potentially Affecting Judgment of Global Risks",
https://intelligence.org/files/CognitiveBiases.pdf

Two other hypotheses accounting for scope neglect include purchase of
moral satisfaction (Kahneman and Knetsch 1992) and good cause dump
(Harrison 1992). Purchase of moral satisfaction suggests that people
spend enough money to create a "warm glow" in themselves, and the amount
required is a property of the person's psychology, having nothing to do
with birds. Good cause dump suggests that people have some amount of
money they are willing to pay for "the environment," and any question
about environmental goods elicits this amount. **[[Scope neglect has
been shown to apply to human lives]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Carson and
Mitchell (1995) report that increasing the alleged risk associated with
chlorinated drinking water from 0.004 to 2.43 annual deaths per 1,000 (a
factor of 600) increased SWTP from \$3.78 to \$15.23 (a factor of 4).
Baron and Greene (1996) found no effect from varying lives saved by a
factor of ten. Fetherstonhaugh et al. (1997), in a paper entitled
"Insensitivity to the Value of Human Life: A Study of Psychophysical
Numbing," found evidence that [our perception of human deaths, and
valuation of human lives]{.underline}, [obeys Weber's
Law]{.underline}---meaning that **[[we use a logarithmic
scale]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And indeed, [studies of scope neglect in
which the quantitative variations are huge enough to elicit any
sensitivity at all]{.underline}, [show small linear increases in
Willingness-To-Pay corresponding to exponential increases in
scope]{.underline}. Kahneman, Ritov, and Schkade (1999) interpret this
as an additive effect of scope affect and prototype affect---the
prototype image elicits most of the emotion, and the scope elicits a
smaller amount of emotion which is added (not multiplied) with the first
amount. [Albert Szent-Györgyi said]{.underline}: "[I am deeply moved if
I see one man suffering and would risk my life for him]{.underline}.
[Then I talk impersonally about the possible pulverization of our big
cities, with a hundred million dead]{.underline}. **[[I am unable to
multiply one man's suffering by a hundred
million]{.underline}]{.mark}**." [Human emotions take place within an
analog brain]{.underline}. **[[The human brain cannot release enough
neurotransmitters to feel emotion a thousand times as strong]{.mark} as
the grief of one funeral]{.underline}**. [A prospective risk going from
10,000,000 deaths to 100,000,000 deaths [**does not multiply by ten the
strength of our determination to stop it.** It adds one more zero on
paper **for our eyes to glaze over**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [an effect so
small that one must usually jump several orders of magnitude to detect
the difference experimentally]{.underline}.

### Reps Not First

Imagery can enact powerful effects, since political actors are almost
always pressed to take action when confronted with images of atrocity
and human suffering resultant from wars, famines and natural disasters.
[Usually, [humanitarian emergencies are conveyed
through]{.mark}]{.underline} media
[[rep]{.mark}re[s]{.mark}entations,]{.underline} which indicate the
important role of images in producing emergency situations as (global)
events (Benthall 1993; **[Campbell 2003b]{.underline}**; Lisle 2009;
Moeller 1999; Postman 1987). Debbie Lisle (2009: 148) maintains that,
\'we see that the objects, issues and events we usually study \[. . .\]
do not even exist without the media \[.. .\] to express them'. As a
consequence, visual images have political and ethical consequences as a
result of their role in shaping private and public ways of seeing
(Bleiker. Kay 2007). This is because how people come to know, think
about and respond to developments in the world is deeply entangled with
how these developments are made visible to them. Visual representations
participate in the processes of how people situate themselves in space
and time, because seeing involves accumulating and ordering information
in order to be able to construct knowledge of people, places and events.
For example, the remembrance of such events as the Vietnam War, the
terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 or the torture in Abu Ghraib
prison cannot be separated from the ways in which these events have been
represented in films, TV and photography (Bleiker 2009; Campbell/Shapiro
2007; Moller2007). The visibility of these events can help to set the
conditions for specific forms of political action. The current war in
Afghanistan serves as [an example]{.underline} of this. Another [is the
nexus of hunger images]{.underline} and relief operations. Vision and
visuality thus become part and parcel of political dynamics, also
revealing the ethical dimension of imagery, as it affects the ways in
which people interact with each other. [[However,]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**[particular]{.mark}** [rep]{.mark}re[s]{.mark}entations [do
not]{.mark} automatically [lead to **particular** responses
as,]{.mark}]{.underline} for instance, [[proponents of
the]{.underline}]{.mark} so-called [[\'CNN effect' would

### NATO Impact 

#### NATO is [key]{.underline}\-\--it's a [full-spectrum]{.underline} force multiplier and [guarantees]{.underline} multilateral logistics 

**Weinrod 16** - Former Secretary of Defense Representative Europe and
Defense Advisor to the U.S. Mission NATO (W Bruce, "We Still Need NATO,"
The American Interest,
https://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/01/15/we-still-need-nato/)

[Not only does NATO remain relevant, but more importantly it continues
to support and advance U.S. security interests]{.underline}---though
again, often in ways that do not make headlines and that casual
observers rarely appreciate in full. Most fundamentally, [NATO provides
a standing multilateral military capability that can **deter or be
deployed** should a significant security threat arise]{.underline}.
Because NATO has a military capability in place, the core elements for
mobilization, deployment, and sustainment of substantial multilateral
military forces already exist. The [ongoing training, exercises, and
regular communication among the national militaries of NATO members
allows them to **jump-start** preparations and actions when needed
**without** very lengthy preparatory work]{.underline}. [This can allow
the U.S. government to proceed in shaping and leading military
coalitions more quickly, at less cost and with greater effectiveness,
than if NATO did not exist and its functional equivalent had to be
invented from scratch at a moment's not]{.underline}ice. While the U.S.
government retains the capacity and the right to act unilaterally if and
when necessary, it makes sense for it to act with others whenever
possible, whether through NATO or ad hoc coalitions of the willing. [A
multilateral framework can provide both political cover and military
resources, and the United States very much can benefit from
both]{.underline}. [The United States also benefits significantly from
NATO's **logistics** capabilities]{.underline}. Pontificating about
grand strategies sounds impressive, but for military effectiveness and
success, [logistics capabilities are what really count]{.underline}.
[For example, while NATO did not formally participate in the 1991 Gulf
War, NATO resources, supplies, bases, and other infrastructure provided
crucial support prior to and during the U.S.-led coalition military
action to force Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait.]{.underline} The coalition
in effect borrowed NATO capacities already in existence, and benefitted
greatly from equipment compatibility and common training and resources.
[Other coalitions of the willing assembled under U.S auspices and
utilizing NATO resources can follow the same approach]{.underline}. In
addition, [the U.S. government has access to the numerous military
facilities and resources that member nations make available to NATO. A
good example is Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, now being used against ISIS
in what is not a formal NATO operation]{.underline}. As importantly,
[working through NATO usually makes it relatively **routine** for host
governments to **agree** to U.S. requests to use facilities within their
territory for military-related purposes]{.underline}. [Without
NATO,]{.underline} in order to fulfill its security responsibilities,
the U.S. government would need to develop and maintain a complex network
of bilateral and multilateral security agreements and arrangements that
would seek to maintain the kind of connectivity and flexibility that
NATO already provides. Further, [the U.S. government would need not only
agreements to access such military facilities but also would likely need
to obtain specific approval from the host nation for each use and
perhaps even in some cases legislative approval]{.underline}. In
general, [it is much simpler, faster, and **easier politically** and
otherwise for nations to grant the United States the use of their
facilities within a NATO framework than it would be to have to grant
permission to the United States on their own]{.underline}. Over recent
decades [NATO]{.underline} has, as noted above, [developed]{.underline}
a [global security]{.underline} network that reflects formalized
relationships with non-NATO nations. For the United States, this brings
the advantage that it can work through NATO to develop or enhance
security relationships with states that belong to the PFP, the MD, the
ICI, and NATO bilateral security relationships. [Working through NATO
provides an extra dimension to U.S. efforts to enhance the military
capacities of friends and allies in various regions who, with training
and assistance, can provide supplementary support to NATO or U.S.-led
operations. NATO also supports U.S. interests by providing a
multilateral framework for a U.S. presence in nations where the U.S.
government wishes to help train and also enhance its military contacts,
but where unilateral U.S. military involvement might be politically
contentious]{.underline}.

#### [Consensus]{.underline} goes aff\-\--NATO [eradicates]{.underline} war

politics and ideology, citing multiple political science professors

[Trump's comments about NATO are like an **arrow** pointed straight at
the **heart of the alliance** \-- and]{.underline}, if implemented,
[would directly threaten the foundations of global peace
itself]{.underline}. Any president could simply choose not to abide by
Article 5. But [abrogating NATO agreements was always deemed
**unthinkable** by both parties, which has played an important part in
maintaining credible deterrence vis-à-vis Russia]{.underline}. [Trump
has put the idea of the US **not defending NATO on the table**, in a
very real way]{.underline}. **[This threatens]{.underline}** the very
integrity **[of NATO itself]{.underline}**. [If NATO allies start to
think that the United States can't be trusted to defend them, that NATO
is just on paper, then they'll start to wonder why they bother to adhere
to this alliance]{.underline} in the first place. If Trump wins the
election, [this could cause them to exit the security agreement
altogether]{.underline}. According to the best available research,
**[this would make war on the European continent far more
likely]{.underline}**. [One study]{.underline}, from professors Jesse C.
Johnson and Brett Ashley Leeds, [surveyed about 200 years of data on
conflicts and concluded that \"defensive alliances lower the probability
of international conflict and]{.underline} are [thus]{.underline} a good
policy option for states seeking to [maintain peace in the
world]{.underline}.\" [Another study looked specifically at the period
from 1950 to 2000 and found that \"formal alliances]{.underline} with
nuclear states appear to [carry significant deterrence benefits.\" The
US\'s formal agreements]{.underline}, then, [deter aggression against
its non-nuclear partners (like Germany and the Baltics]{.underline}). In
their new book on American grand strategy, Dartmouth scholars Steven
[Brooks and]{.underline} William [Wohlforth]{.underline} also surveyed
research from regional experts and [found a similar
consensus]{.underline}. In Europe, they write, [\"most
assessments]{.underline} nonetheless [sum up to the conclusion that NATO
is a net security plus]{.underline}.\" [Trump, then, could end up
weakening one of America's most important security
agreements]{.underline} --- and may already have done so.

#### Remaining steadfast to treaty commitments [against Russia]{.underline} is perceived by allies and enemies [globally]{.underline}

**Samp 17** -- senior fellow @ CSIS, MA in International Affairs @ GW
(Lisa, with Kathleen Hicks et al, "Recalibrating US Strategy Towards
Russia," Kindle Edition)

[How the United States chooses to manage the Russia challenge will shape
the geopolitical land- scape for decades to come. U.S. allies, partners,
and adversaries in the Middle East, Asia, and elsewhere **will be
watching** to see how the United States responds to the]{.underline}
evolving [challenges posed by Russia and will calibrate their behavior
accordingly]{.underline}. In the rush to make deals with Russia to se-
cure lesser objectives, the United States may well find itself sacri-
ficing a more fundamental goal: advancing a global order that benefits
our people, our econo- my, and our constitutional values. [Standing
**resolutely** by our allies and our treaty commitments is **central to
upholding that order**. We must meet Russia\'s efforts to challenge it
with the steel of our determination rather than mush that cedes our
hard-won gains]{.underline}.

#### Ambiguous US commitments to NATO cause Russia to [test resolve]{.underline} in Europe\-\--it causes a deterrence [perception crisis]{.underline}

https://www.vox.com/2016/7/21/12247074/donald-trump-nato-war)

[Trump's comments are]{.underline} worse than just [undermining NATO: By
refusing to commit to the Baltics **categorically**]{.underline}, [he
encourages Russia to test American resolve in dangerous
ways]{.underline}. [According to]{.underline} some [Russia
experts]{.underline}, Vladimir [Putin's ultimate wish in Europe is to
break NATO. The way to do that, according to these scholars, is to
expose the Article 5 guarantee as hollow: to show that when push comes
to shove, the United States]{.underline} or other large NATO powers
[wouldn't actually defend the weaker states]{.underline}. [The Baltic
states would be the most likely scenario for this to
happen]{.underline}. They are very small, they're right on Russia's
borders, and they aren\'t really all that important to Western
countries\' own security. By threatening these states, Russia would
force a question: Are the United States, Britain, and France really
willing to sacrifice their own soldiers in defense of a tiny state? In
2014, the Danish intelligence agency --- note that Denmark is a NATO
ally --- publicly warned that this was a serious possibility: [Russia
may attempt to test NATO's cohesion]{.underline} by engaging in military
intimidation of the Baltic countries, for instance [with a **threatening
military build-up** close to the borders of these countries and
simultaneous attempts of political **pressure**, destabilization and
possibly **infiltration**]{.underline}. [Russia could launch such an
intimidation campaign]{.underline} in connection with a serious crisis
in the post-Soviet space or another international crisis in which Russia
confronts the United States and NATO. [The critical issue in preventing
this scenario, again, is the **perception of NATO
commitment**]{.underline}. [So long as Putin believes that the US and
other major powers are firmly committed to the defense of their treaty
allies, he's **unlikely to risk starting a war** that he would almost
certainly lose]{.underline}. [This is why Trump's comments are so
damaging: They send a direct signal to the Kremlin that a Trump-led
America will be less than serious about the defense of NATO allies. This
suggests that a ploy to break NATO might have a bigger risk]{.underline}
of succeeding than previously thought. But note that [Trump]{.underline}
also [refused to say unequivocally that he wouldn't abide by the NATO
treaty]{.underline}. "I don't want to tell you what I'd do because I
don't want Putin to know what I'd do," he said. [But the entire point of
NATO is that Putin needs to know what America will do]{.underline}. [If
he knows the US will defend the Baltics, then he will likely back
off.]{.underline} [If he knows the US won't defend the Baltics, then we
could have the breakup of NATO]{.underline} --- which would be quite bad
but wouldn't immediately risk World War III. [The nightmare
scenario]{.underline}, though, [is that Putin's confidence in NATO is
undermined even though the United States under Trump remains committed
to defending its treaty allies]{.underline}. [That's the scenario under
which misperceptions]{.underline} potentially **[escalate into an actual
war between the world's two largest nuclear powers]{.underline}**. Max
Fisher wrote an extended piece on how this uncertainty could plausibly
escalate to war for Vox last year; I encourage you to read it. But the
point, according the experts Fisher spoke to, is that **[a firm
understanding that the US will defend its NATO allies is
crucial]{.underline}**. \"That kind of **[misperception]{.underline}**
situation **[is]{.underline}** definitely possible, and that's **[how
wars start]{.underline}**,\" Steve Saideman, a professor who studies
NATO at Carleton University, told Fisher. He then scarily compared
modern Europe with pre--World War I Europe: \"**[The thing that makes
war most thinkable is when other people don't think it's
thinkable]{.underline}**.\"

The personnel and structural changes in the United States and in the
world are forcing Germany to make difficult choices, from which
decision-makers in government and society can no longer shrink. [The
nuclearization of the twenty-first century is threatening to make
Germany defenseless]{.underline}. Rather than engaging in disarmament,
the world is threatened with the proliferation of nuclear dictatorships
based on the model of North Korea. Thus, [Germany must arm itself
against this threat.]{.underline} Moreover, **[Germany as a democratic
nuclear power would strengthen the security of the West]{.underline}**.
These questions must be discussed without hysteria; there is no need for
alarmism. Instead, the debate should focus on how to ensure Germany's
long-term security in an increasingly confusing world. Considering the
general rise of national egoism, a country like Germany must look toward
its own security. Ideally, [every potential aggressor must be deterred
by nuclear power]{.underline}. If the crises of the past years have
taught us one thing, it is that the impossible can become a reality very
quickly. Yet, above all [nuclear weapons have a political function,
namely to protect a country from blackmail in crisis situations. A
country's crisis diplomacy can only be successful when it is backed by
hard military power.]{.underline} After all, [the annexation of Crimea
**would probably not have occurred if NATO had possessed a credible
deterrent capacity** or if Russia could have been deterred by escalation
dominance]{.underline}. **[Therefore, Germany must also prepare itself
for this eventuality]{.underline}**. It is all well and good to call on
the Europeans to finally take their fate into their own hands, but
experience has eroded confidence in the ability of the Europeans to
follow a common security policy. Finally, the ritualized idealization of
European integration and the demonization of national interest has led
the European Union into a dead end and deep crisis. Consequently,
striking a balance between community interests and national
considerations is long overdue, especially in Germany. [In the face of
new transatlantic uncertainties and potential confrontations, national
defense based on an independent nuclear deterrence capacity **must be
given priority**]{.underline}. As the French say "Gouverner c'est
prevoir"---the art of government is based on foresight. Therefore, we
must not content ourselves with high-handed criticism of Trump; instead,
[we must arm ourselves militarily, against all sides and by any means
necessary. Following such a realistic, forward-looking policy, **Germany
will one day be able to handle crises confidently and strengthen the
free world**]{.underline}.

NATO needs to refresh its nuclear doctrine and employment policies. [In
the view of]{.underline} Matthew [Kroenig, a leading U.S. nuclear
deterrence theorist]{.underline}: [NATO must make clear in its nuclear
deterrence doctrine that it will respond to any use of nuclear weapons
against its members with a devastating nuclear
counterstrike]{.underline}. NATO should also retain the option of
responding to a strictly conventional Russian assault against a NATO
ally with a nuclear response. It should maintain this option not because
an early nuclear response would be necessary or automatic, but rather
because there is no reason to assure Russia that this would not happen.
Moreover, **[NATO's easternmost neighbors would vastly prefer nuclear
deterrence over a potential Russian incursion.]{.underline}**

In other words, the policies emanating from American intentions will
ultimately be of a pro-European nature, if dangerously delayed.
Nonetheless, the scope of discretion that has always characterized the
nature of [NATO's article 5 has been stretched by Trump to a level that
has seen the **alliance's credibility at its lowest since
1949**]{.underline}. While this disregard for NATO's reputational costs
(to its enemies' benefits) may reflect his transactional approach, [it
has already helped evaporate the effects of preventive deterrence,
conventional and nuclear, vis-à-vis Russia]{.underline}. It has also
heavily and publicly undermined the cohesion and, thus, the strength of
'the West' as such. And, fundamentally, it has, without further
strategic consultation within NATO, exposed Germany's military
vulnerability right in front of Putin's eyes and his cutting-edge
military. Today, [Germany must take the initiative and rebalance the
politics of article 5]{.underline}. In fact, this should be its
overarching strategic priority. The threat perception regarding Russia
is the glue that binds Europeans together. Tellingly, [not only have
leading Polish policymakers publicly endorsed a massive increase in
German hard power, they have also **indicated their agreement to a
European nuclear force.**]{.underline} Germany\'s so-called nuclear
participation as NATO member is very important as a means of
consultation about strategic questions; though, as such participation
only applies to short-range---and thus tactical nuclear weapons---it
does not provide any deterrent effects. Therefore, in light of Trump\'s
foreseeably unchanging approach, [Germany must undertake an overall
policy change]{.underline}. [**To strengthen NATO\'s credibility again
and safeguard its strategic security**, it needs to step forward and
make the establishment of a European nuclear force the
centerpiece]{.underline} of a new strategic planning process. This would
not, as it was suggested by the French in the past, be aimed at
financing their force de frappe, but rather [Germany would now
have]{.underline} equal standing in joint nuclear decision-making and,
quite literally, [**one hand at the nuclear trigger.** Thereby, Berlin
would powerfully address, within NATO, the strategic imponderabilities
caused by the current U.S. President and his isolationist disregard for
longstanding and very loyal, if weaker, allies.]{.underline} At the same
time, [such a new strategic policy is intended to signal to America that
this is not an attempt to change the European Union into a NATO rival,
rather it is meant to **credibly strengthen NATO's appearance to others,
such as Russia**]{.underline}. This would also help affect the dangerous
misperception of a decaying West, unwilling to fight for its way of
life, a position widely held in and by China.

[Amidst]{.underline} this [trade turmoil, China has taken steps to

importantly, [the petrodollar]{.underline} creates a strong pillar for

[It has long been a goal of the Chinese leadership to see
the]{.underline} national currency, the [yuan, play a greater role in
international finance]{.underline}. The
[internationalization]{.underline} of the yuan [has been pursued through
many initiatives and strategies, most recently in]{.underline} relation
to [**the IMF** and the inclusion of the yuan in a "basket" of
currencies underpinning **Special Drawing Rights**. Internationalization
has]{.underline} doubtless [**been delayed** by relative
non-convertibility and China's state-run financial system]{.underline},
amongst other factors. As matters are liberalized on the financial
front, so it becomes more credible for the yuan to play the global role
that would be expected of the currency of the world's largest trading
nation, the world's largest manufacturing nation, and the world's second
largest economy. [But the year 2018 has seen a dramatic break with this
SDR-focused strategy]{.underline}, and its replacement by a strategy
that targets the oil market -- the world's largest commodity market,
where trading in US dollars has been near-universal for decades.
[This]{.underline} break [involves the launch by China of a **new oil
futures contract on the Shanghai International Energy
Exchange**]{.underline} (INE). Launched on March 26, 2018, the Shanghai
oil futures contract has [met with solid market acceptance]{.underline}.
It has already overtaken comparable oil futures offerings in both
Singapore and Dubai. Of course [it still lags]{.underline} in volume
terms [behind the rival Brent crude oil futures contract traded in
London, and the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil futures traded in New
York. But **the very fact that it is being traded
seriously**]{.underline} by multinational commodity traders (like
Glencore) and is priced in a manner that is comparable to the Brent and
WTI indices, [indicates that this is **an initiative with the potential
to bring the Chinese yuan to the core of global commodity trading
activity**]{.underline}. This article analyzes the significance of the
Chinese oil futures contract initiative, creating what is widely known
as the "petroyuan", and sets it in the framework of the broader
internationalization of the yuan. It is important not to overstate the
significance of this event, as the institutions supporting the US dollar
as global currency are still powerful and dominant. China's prospects
have also been dented by the aggressive trade tactics launched by the
Trump administration, with a clear focus on China as principal target.
The issue is complicated by the re-imposition of US sanctions against
Iran, and specifically against Irani oil exports to China (as discussed
below). But there is a case to be made for the strategic significance of
this Chinese intervention in the commodity markets. Just as the current
US financial and industrial hegemony is grounded in the dollar's
exclusivity as vehicle for global oil trading, so [the decisive
intervention by the Chinese to create a credible alternative in oil
could well have the effect of ushering in a new, multipolar world of
trade, finance and industry.]{.underline} The case can be made that
[earlier Chinese initiatives to internationalize the yuan]{.underline},
such as the widely debated initiative to recast the financial system
based on Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), [were premature in the absence
of]{.underline} widely accepted [use]{.underline} of the yuan [in
commodity trading markets. **Now** China has taken an apparently
well-planned and executed initiative that **is focused precisely on the
commodity markets, and in particular on oil, the world's largest traded
commodity**. The initiative is backed by the gold convertibility of the
oil futures contract, creating an important safety valve]{.underline}.
The initiative can be viewed as [supported by **complementary efforts**
to create a yuan-based trading system in the form of the **Belt and Road
Initiative** and the **Asian Infrastructure Investment
Bank**]{.underline}. These far-sighted measures are coming together at a
time when the US is focused inwards on short-term trade measures like
imposing punitive tariffs on China and its allies including those in
Europe, Canada and Asia, and withdrawing from the Trans Pacific
Partnership. But the storm clouds created by the Trump initiatives
certainly complicate the picture -- particularly the re-imposition of
sanctions against Iran and its oil exports.

While [**it is premature to see the yuan displacing the US dollar
anytime soon**, the prospect of yuan trading in oil]{.underline} (and
subsequently in other commodity markets) [appears to be off to a strong
start]{.underline}. There is the oil futures contract now being traded
strongly on the INE in Shanghai. There is the bilateral trading in oil
between China and oil suppliers, in yuan -- where Russia, Iran and
Venezuela are the lead countries so far. There is the gold
convertibility of the yuan-based oil futures contracts. And there is the
grade-specification of the futures contract that is better aligned with
Asian oil consumption patterns than the existing international
standards, Brent crude and WTI. [Against these positive signs there are
the negatives that the introduction of the yuan-denominated oil contract
is now complicated by the imposition of **US sanctions against Iran and
Russi**a and by **wider trade sanctions** imposed by the Trump
administration against China]{.underline}. While these could have an
unexpected effect in accelerating China's move away from the US dollar
in oil trades, they could also have a decidedly negative impact if China
is induced to move away from Irani oil imports. Thus [the outcome is
likely to be the result of conflicting forces]{.underline}. One reading,
whose plausibility is argued in this article, is that yuan-denominated
oil trading is likely to become more significant, partially displacing
US dollar oil trading in one market after another. On the other hand
[there is **much momentum behind the incumbent hegemony of the US
dollar** and the practice of invoicing oil sales in
dollars]{.underline}. What can be said is that the shift from a
dollar-dominated world towards a multi-polar world order is now well
underway.

#### All of China's measures to internationalize the yuan are irrelevant in the face of dollar heg.

**Slav 18** (Irina Slav, 8-21-2018, a writer for the U.S.-based
Divergente LLC consulting firm with over a decade of experience writing
on the oil and gas industry, \"Petro-Yuan Not Quite Yet: Chinese Oil
Futures a Risky Endeavor\", Wolf Street,

[When the long-awaited yuan-denominated oil futures launched earlier
this year, opinions were split]{.underline}: one camp argued with
passion that the days of the petrodollar were numbered, its demise a
certainty. The other camp argued with just as much passion the yuan has
yet to catch up with the dollar as an international currency, and the
Chinese futures had basically as much of a chance as a snowflake in
hell. [Six months later]{.underline}, opinions remain split, but now
[the two camps have some facts and figures in their
arsenal]{.underline}. For example, a figure for the pro-petroyuan camp
was the record surge in trading volume in June, to 137.5 million tons of
crude for delivery in September. This translates into 137,503 lots,
compared to a combined 2.6 million lots for Brent and WTI together,
though, so the yuan contract still has a way to go to catch up. [The
anti-petroyuan camp]{.underline}, however, seems to [have a bit more
going for it after six months of trade. Bloomberg cites **traders as
saying that the exchange rate of the yuan coupled with storage costs
make the Chinese oil contract still a high-risk endeavor**]{.underline}.
[The **yuan has been falling** in recent months on the back of slowing
economic growth and the tariff spat with the United States]{.underline}.
There is a lot of space for surprises, however, and unpredictability is
not something low-risk traders like, so [exchange rates are one thing
that could put them off the yuan contract. Storage costs in China are
another problem. They are much higher than elsewhere: US\$0.95 per
barrel per month in the S]{.underline}hanghai
[I]{.underline}nternational [E]{.underline}nergy [E]{.underline}xchange
[compared with US\$0.05 per barrel per month at the Louisiana Offshore
Oil Port]{.underline}, Bloomberg reports. The reason for the higher cost
is limited storage capacity availability and the requirement that the
cargo be stored at a specific storage facility rather than at any
available. So, in light of these unpleasant facts, what does the
yuan-denominated futures contract have going for them? Well, apparently,
they could make sellers richer than if they choose to trade Middle East
grades. The yuan contract last week traded at a considerable premium to
all other oil futures, with the premium to the Middle East benchmark at
US\$3.35 per barrel. That makes a profit of US\$6.7 million for a cargo,
according to Bloomberg calculations---certainly not a small sum. But is
it worth all the risks? Perhaps it is and perhaps it isn't, but it looks
like it is still too early to say. The seriousness of the risks, after
all, is relative. This was evidenced in the record-high trading interest
in yuan futures in early June that some observers, quoted by S&P Global
Platts, attributed to the heightened price volatility in the Brent and
WTI benchmarks. On the other hand, [storage costs are a fixed problem
that is not about to go away]{.underline}. It's a risk that traders have
probably already learned to factor into their calculations. [Exchange
rates are another cesspool of volatility]{.underline}, but volatility is
a double-edged sword. Economic data from China may still surprise
positively as it has before, despite the tariffs.
[Ultimately]{.underline}, however, [the question of whether the
petrodollar will be replaced by the petroyuan is moot. The reason for

"[A lot of countries around the world are turning to Europe for
increased partnership in trade]{.underline},'' said Jens Nordvig, who
was Wall Street's top-ranked currency strategist for five years running
before setting up Exante Data a little over a year ago. "It's not crazy
to think that's also going to be happening in the area of capital
markets and reserve allocations. The bottom line is, t[his trade stance
the U.S. has now is not helpful in terms of making the dollar
attractive]{.underline}" for central banks that hold billions in
reserves. Nordvig estimates a half-trillion dollars could flow into the
euro in the next two years, equal to a 25 percent boost in the
currency's share of reserves. Developing countries and oil-exporting
nations in the Middle East, which rely heavily on international trade,
are the most likely to lift their euro allocations, he said. Six
emerging economies \-- China, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, India, South Korea
and Brazil \-- hold almost half the world's reserves, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. China alone has amassed over \$3 trillion in foreign
exchange \-- primarily as a result of its cheap exports to the U.S.
Trade Whale \"Buying Opportunity\" Silliness [**It does not matter
whether countries like the dollar or like euros**. Reserves are a mostly
**a function of trade math**]{.underline}. [**As the US deficit
increases**, and it will, **foreign countries will accumulate more US
assets**. It\'s **a mathematical necessity** that has nothing to do with
likability]{.underline}. From time to time, countries like China may
sell treasuries or other US dollar denominated assets to stop capital
flight. Death of the Dollar? Death of US dollar? China launches
petro-yuan to challenge greenback's dominance says RT. PetroYuan futures
started trading today. I am amused by the hype. Energy Independence [The
PetroYuan is not about the likability of dollars, nor does it represent
a desire by China to dethrone the dollar]{.underline}. Recall that the
US is on the verge of energy independence. As a result, the US will buy
less oil from the Mideast . China runs a huge trade surplus with the US,
but also a big deficit with the Mideast energy producers. Those
producers will now accumulate Yuan. PetroYuan Represents US Success
Three weeks ago, I reported US will Overtake Russia to Become Top Oil
Producer by 2023. As a direct result, the Saudi trade surplus with the
US will crash. Those oil exporters are finally ready to hold yuan. The
huge irony in all the petroyuan hype is that it is a direct result of
forthcoming US energy independence. That\'s a US achievement, far bigger
than the symbolic gain by China. No Dollar Dethrone: Three Reasons [The
idea that the yuan will soon replace the dollar as the world\'s reserve

economic reasons]{.underline}.

[In order to stabilize the petrodollar, the United States]{.underline}
also [needs a stable Middle East]{.underline}. Sanctions are one way to
control Middle Eastern affairs. Because oil is found in so many aspects
of world operations, major world deals are made in dollars and pass
through American-connected banks, allowing the U.S. government to
monitor, control, and sanction such deals. [Paired with the **immense
sale of arms and weapons** to Saudi Arabia, the United States provides
countless **incentives for the Saudis to stay in the deal**, helping
Saudi Arabia remain a prominent Middle Eastern power.]{.underline} In
the end, [the linchpin of this relationship is Saudi Arabia's confidence
in the United States dollar]{.underline}, as it indicates the weight of
the Saudi's trade surplus power. If these conditions are fulfilled, any
cheating or straying from Saudi Arabia's under-the-table agreement would
be illogical and detrimental. However, [the United States' continuing
trade and fiscal deficits are weakening the dollar and Saudi petrodollar
holdings]{.underline}. Combine this with the unforeseen rise of China
and conciliatory actions by China towards Saudi Arabia, and the United
State's petrodollar is in obvious trouble. New Threats Earlier this

"petro-yuan," which would effectively axe the
petrodollar**]{.underline}. Although Saudi Arabia relies heavily on U.S.
military power, [Saudi Arabia warming ties with China closeness are
alarming]{.underline}. China's growing economy and standing in the world
could undermine the attitude towards the United States. Above anything
else[, a shift in alliances could threaten America's

could disrupt a balance of power that has ensured relative world peace
since the Cold War. A weak US economy would leave the nation with a
weaker and drive a new dual-hegemony between Russia and China, who
signed an Eurasian Economic Cooperation pact on May 17th in Astana. As

dollar]{.underline} -- by taking it off of oil altogether -- is a future
possibility. In the last few months, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates' [reaction to the Chinese-Saudi Arabia negotiations
have been rather quiet with little report to no media attention.
With]{.underline} President [Trump]{.underline}'s continued rhetoric and
talk, it is clear that tariffs and a trade war will be of continual
focus, at least much more relative to the possible attack at the
petrodollar, and indirectly, at inflation in the United States. [Time
will tell if President Trump continues with the United States' historic
and desperate protectionism of the petrodollar]{.underline}. However, as
other nations like China and Russia rise to power, America should be
weary of confrontation in this region. In the end, America has an
interesting competitive advantage in its petrodollar deal with regional
powers like Saudi Arabia. [A final wild card--better energy technology
and natural gas, especially from Russia and Iran--can weaken OPEC
supremacy over the oil market, and thus the petrodollar]{.underline}.
However, [this is **not as dangerous as** **Chinese intervention into

Oil trading and oil futures [The oil market]{.underline}, currently
estimated to be worth \$14 trillion, [is]{.underline} (as mentioned
above) [the world's largest commodity market]{.underline}.1 [The
**current system of oil trading in US dollars** dates from an agreement
reached in 1974]{.underline} between the US and House of Saud of Saudi
Arabia, [to the effect that all purchases of oil from Saudi Arabia would
be made in US dollars, and surpluses would be recycled by Saudi Arabia
through US financial markets]{.underline}. These terms were extended to
encompass all members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) in 1975. [The **terms cemented the primacy of the US
dollar in world currency, trade and particularly oil trade
markets**]{.underline}. [In this way **the US managed to prolong its
dollar hegemony** beyond the decades of the post-war financial
settlement, which saw the primacy of the Bretton Woods institutions the
IMF and World Bank]{.underline}, and the move by President Nixon in 1971
to end the US dollar's convertibility into gold. Taking the US dollar
off the gold standard could well have undermined US financial hegemony
-- [but **the US-Saudi agreement** to price oil purchases exclusively in
US dollars **saved the day**. This agreement has been strictly complied
with by the Saudis]{.underline} as well as by the Gulf states members of
OPEC, [and has remained the bed**rock of a US dollar-centered global

#### Saudi's purchasing Treasuries and strengthening the petrodollar because of the arms sales relationship.

**McCormick 19** (Liz McCormick, reporter for Bloomberg, 6-30-2019,
\"Saudi Arabia's Buying of U.S. Treasuries Is Soaring Under Trump\",
Bloomberg,
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-30/saudi-buying-of-treasuries-is-soaring-under-trump,
accessed 7-2-2019) ml

By now, President Donald [**Trump's bromance with Mohammed bin Salman**
of Saudi Arabia is well documented]{.underline}. The platitudes and
chummy photo-ops. [The **billions of dollars in U.S. arms
sales**]{.underline}. And, of course, the willingness to brush aside
evidence implicating the crown prince in the murder of journalist Jamal
Khashoggi. [But what's gone largely unnoticed is]{.underline} just how
enthusiastic [the kingdom]{.underline} has been in **[snapping up
America's debt]{.underline}**. After aggressively culling its holdings
of U.S. government debt for most of 2016, Saudi Arabia has amassed an
even larger position since Trump's election in November that year. Based
on the latest reported [figures, the nation nearly doubled its ownership
of Treasuries to \$177 billion]{.underline}. No major foreign creditor
has ramped up its lending to the U.S. faster. Coincidence? Perhaps.
After all, [you could probably marshal any number of plausible
explanations]{.underline} for the timing of the oil-exporting nation's
buildup that don\'t involve some political quid pro quo. **[Rising
petrodollar revenue]{.underline}**. Risk aversion. A shift out of
negative-yielding bonds. And considering how big the U.S. deficit has
grown because of Trump's tax cuts, the amounts involved won't move the
needle all that much when it comes to America's financing needs.
Whatever the case may be, however, this much is clear: as Trump
continues to defend Prince Mohammed in the face of growing criticism on
a whole host of issues, from the Saudi-led war in Yemen to his alleged
role in the gruesome killing of Khashoggi, [the kingdom has everything
to gain from appearing to lend financial support to its most important
ally]{.underline} --- even if it isn't intentional. That\'s particularly
true after talk surfaced in May that China, the largest foreign creditor
to the U.S., might be considering the unlikely move of dumping its
Treasuries to punish Trump over his trade war. (Though at the Group of
20 summit in Osaka, the two countries declared a truce, at least for
now.) ["It's **a relationship where one hand washes the other**," said
Martin Indyk, a distinguished fellow at the C]{.underline}ouncil on
[F]{.underline}oreign [R]{.underline}elations and a former U.S. special
envoy to the Middle East during the Clinton administration. [Buying of
Treasuries could be a "manifestation of the closeness of the
relationship."]{.underline} Indyk was quick to note he doesn't have any
particular inside knowledge on the situation and **[the Treasury market
is a natural destination for Saudi Arabia's petrodollars
anyway]{.underline}**. But he suggested that as tensions between the
U.S. and Iran escalate, it also makes sense Trump would want the Saudis
to boost production to keep oil prices in check. [More output means more
petrodollars, which can then be recycled back into Treasuries. The
numbers stand out. From the end of October 2016, the last month before
Trump's election, through April of this year, Saudi Arabia upped its
ownership of Treasuries from \$97 billion to \$177 billion, Treasury
Department data show]{.underline}. The 83% jump was by far the biggest
among the top 12 foreign creditors in percentage terms. (The U.K., a
banking center whose figures are seen as a proxy for hedge funds and
other global investors, had the biggest absolute gain. Its holdings rose
from \$207 billion to \$301 billion.) That comes as China's holdings of
Treasuries fell to a two-year low amid increasing trade tensions between
the world's two largest economies. The Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority,
which manages the country's investments, didn't respond to a request for
comment. The buildup is also noteworthy because of just how dramatically
Saudi Arabia reduced its holdings in the months leading up to the
election. In the first nine months of 2016, the kingdom slashed its
ownership of Treasuries by almost 30% in its most aggressive retreat in
over a decade. Quid Pro Quo? A big part of the drawdown had to do with
Saudi Arabia's fiscal crisis at the time, when the monetary authority
burned through tens of billions of dollars to plug its biggest budget
deficit in a quarter-century. Yet there was also plenty of speculation
about Saudi Arabia's political motivations as well. In April of that
year, the New York Times reported that Saudi officials warned the Obama
administration and members of Congress it would sell off \$750 billion
worth of Treasuries and other American assets if lawmakers passed a bill
allowing the kingdom to be held liable in U.S. courts for the Sept. 11
terror attacks. (It ultimately became law after Congress overrode
President Barack Obama's veto.) That came after America took tentative
steps toward a rapprochement with Saudi Arabia's archrival Iran,
highlighted by the landmark nuclear deal under Obama that Trump pulled
out of last year. So with Trump, the kingdom has every incentive to play
nice. Besides breaking with tradition to visit Saudi Arabia on his first
foreign trip, Trump and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior
adviser, have forged close, personal relationships with the crown
prince, who's known as MBS. At the G-20, Trump met the kingdom's de
facto leader for breakfast on Saturday, calling him a "friend" and
praising their "great relationship." Crucially, Trump has repeatedly
downplayed Prince Mohammed's role in Khashoggi's killing inside the
Saudi consulate in Istanbul, in spite of CIA intelligence that led
lawmakers to unanimously assign blame to him. (Saudi government
officials have denied that he had anything to do with the murder.) [In
May**, Trump even bypassed Congress to approve a \$2 billion arms sale
to Saudi Arabia over bipartisan objections**. While the Senate blocked
the move, Trump will likely use his veto to push the deal
through]{.underline}. Critics say that by repeatedly giving Saudi Arabia
the benefit of the doubt, Trump has provided cover for Prince Mohammed
--- once feted as a progressive reformer --- to crack down on dissent at
home and wage a brutal war in Yemen, which has led to over 200,000
deaths, according to the United Nations. Granted, there are reasons to
think that Saudi Arabia's investments in Treasuries have nothing to do
with politics. From the end of October 2016 through April this year, the
price of Brent crude oil rose just a shade over 50%, a boon for the
coffers of the world's largest oil-exporting nation. Saudi Arabia may
also be shifting its exposure away from lower-yielding European bonds,
according to Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn
Global Forex. After all, 10-year Treasuries currently yield about 2.02%,
versus roughly -0.33% for German bunds. And as the world's safe-haven
asset, it's not hard to see Saudi Arabia moving into U.S. government
debt as a hedge for weakening global growth. "I suspect this is partly a
debt management issue" rather than from any political motive, Chandler
said. "Especially since there hasn\'t been a rise in Saudi Arabia\'s
(foreign) reserves." Indeed, even as the country's holdings of
Treasuries have jumped, its foreign-reserve assets have hardly budged.
It's a potential sign that Saudi Arabia is funneling more cash to plug
its deficit as it ramps up domestic spending. Yet in some ways, [**Saudi
Arabia's ownership of U.S. government debt has always been influenced by
political considerations**. For more than four decades, how much the
kingdom actually held was kept secret]{.underline} from the public as
part of a strategic agreement brokered during the Nixon administration.
The unique arrangement bound together two countries that shared few
common values, reshaping U.S.-Saudi relations for generations. It was
only in May 2016 that the U.S. began releasing a detailed breakdown of
Saudi Arabia's holdings in response to a Freedom of Information Act
request filed by Bloomberg News.

#### Ending arms sales would result in investment retaliation against the U.S.

President Donald [Trump threatened his most important Arab ally with
"severe punishment" if it was shown to have killed a top regime critic.
Saudi Arabia hit back]{.underline} with a not-so-veiled threat of its
own to weaponize its vast oil exports. The disappearance of Washington
Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi after he stepped inside the Saudi
consulate on Oct. 2 began as a tussle between regional heavyweights
Turkey and Saudi Arabia. But it spread rapidly to threaten Trump's
Middle East policy that's built around ever closer ties with the
kingdom's autocratic rulers. With Saudi Arabia shifting away from its
flat-out denials of involvement to announce an internal investigation,
and Trump floating the theory of "rogue killers," efforts to lower
tensions appear to be underway. If they fail, what actions could the two
sides take and what factors may hold them back? [SAUDI
ARABIA]{.underline} 1. The Oil Weapon The U.S. and Saudi Arabia are two
of the world's top oil producers. Saudi Arabia's more than 7 million
barrels a day of crude exports \-- the most in the world \-- give the
kingdom a key role in balancing global energy markets. Trump has urged
Saudi Arabia to put more crude on the market to pull prices back from
near four-year highs above \$80 a barrel. He is also leaning on Saudi
Arabia, a key ally in his stand-off with Iran, to replace barrels that
will come off the market when sanctions on the Islamic Republic take
effect next month. Were the Saudis to back away from signals they are
willing to meet global demand, prices could spike to \$100 a barrel,
just as Trump wants lower gas prices going into midterm elections that
could help determine the rest of his presidency. It might also make it
harder for U.S. sanctions to take as much Iranian oil off the market as
he seeks. The Saudis, meanwhile, would collect the profits. If they cut
output, oil prices could rise more sharply, but that would risk angering
customers and harming the global economy. Saudi Arabia last used its
petroleum wealth as a political weapon in 1973-74, when it led an Arab
oil embargo during a war between Israel and a coalition of Arab states.
2. [**U.S. Bond Holdings** In 2016, the U.S. released details of Saudi
holdings of American debt for the first time]{.underline}. The numbers
had been secret for four decades, part of a deal whereby the U.S. would
buy Saudi oil and provide it with military aid and the kingdom would
plow petrodollars into Treasuries to finance U.S. spending. [The **grand
total of Saudi holdings in 2016? \$117 billion**, ranking Saudi Arabia
among the **top 12 foreign holders of U.S. bonds.** Some analysts have
speculated that it might hold even more indirectly.]{.underline} Saud[i
Arabia could divest its Treasury holdings, and threatened to do just
that when it faced pressure]{.underline} over the involvement of its
citizens in the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. But it is far from the biggest
direct investor, limiting the impact. China and Japan hold over \$1
trillion each of U.S. Treasuries, which are classed among the safest
investments on Earth. "[The most powerful weapon Saudi has is oil and
its investments]{.underline}," said Fawaz Gerges, a professor of
international relations at the London School of Economics. "I doubt
Saudi will decrease the production of oil to the world economy because
it will hurt itself, and I doubt that Saudi will withdraw its
investments." 3. Regional Rethink Trump is counting on America's
strategic alliance with Saudi Arabia as he ramps up pressure on Iran
following his decision to ditch the 2015 nuclear deal. The two allies do
have some strategic differences \-- Trump for example has demanded the
Saudis pay more towards securing the Middle East, home to several U.S.
military bases \-- but ties are better than they were under the Obama
administration. Turki Al Dakhil, who heads the Saudi state-owned Arabiya
news network, wrote on Sunday that if pushed, the Sunni Muslim monarchy
could rethink its regional relationships, going as far as patching up
differences with Shiite Iran and its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah. Yet that
would mark a seismic shift in regional policy and analysts say it's
extremely unlikely. Saudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars pushing
back against what it says is growing Iranian influence in Yemen \--
where a more than three-year Saudi-led offensive has contributed to the
country's descent into humanitarian disaster \-- as well as Iraq, Syria
and Lebanon. "Saudi is unlikely to take any retaliatory steps," said
Gerges. It's "waging battles on multiple fronts against Iran in the
region and needs American and British support not just in military and
arms but also in terms of the security umbrella. The Saudis would be
left on their own." [UNITED STATES 1. Cut Arms Sales]{.underline} Trump
has said it would be "foolish" to cancel arms deals over the Khashoggi
case and that any measures taken should not jeopardize Saudi weapons
contracts with the likes of Boeing Co., Lockheed Martin Corp. and
Raytheon Co., which could put jobs at risk. If the U.S. abandoned what
he estimated as some \$110 billion in arms sales to the kingdom, the
Saudis would turn to Russia and China instead, he said. The president
must also contend with [the Senate]{.underline}, however, where some
[are urging a block on future arms sales to the kingdom. Analysts said
military hardware deals could face growing scrutiny from
Congress]{.underline}, as could U.S. support for the war in Yemen.
Though the Saudis can take their money elsewhere, Ian Bremmer, president
of the Eurasia Group consultancy, said they'd want U.S. weapons as that
would keep their respective systems integrated. "With the U.S. as the
world's largest oil producer, the relationship is even more imbalanced
than it was before," Bremmer said in an email. "[There's not much the
Americans need from the Saudis. **The reverse is not
true**."]{.underline}

#### Saudi Arabia is key to the global petroyuan.

\-\-- even if Saudi only exports the petroyuan to China, it would still
unseat the petrodollar

Could the Petro-yuan Unseat the Petrodolar But [it won't be easy to
unseat the petrodollar without the participation of some **major oil
producers** like]{.underline} Russia and **[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**.
Between them Saudi Arabia and Russia account for 26% of global oil
production and 25% of oil exports. Russia is already on board along with
Iran and Venezuela. 28 A more significant development was Russia
agreeing to some yuan-based oil trade in 2015. [Angered by the US
sanctions, the Russians began undermining the petrodollar by settling
more oil contracts in Asian currencies, especially the Chinese
yuan]{.underline}, the Hong Kong dollar and Singapore dollar. 29 [China
is now trying to persuade Saudi Arabia to start accepting the petro-yuan
for its crude oil. If the Chinese succeed, **other oil exporters could
follow suit**. Saudi Arabia currently sells a little more than 1 million
barrels of oil a day (mbd) to China]{.underline}. Russia is still the
top supplier to China, exporting 1.55 mbd and, in fact, Russia has been
taking market share away from Saudi Arabia in China. [If Riyadh wants to
avoid losing more ground, it may have to agree to petro-yuan
sales]{.underline}. For [Saudi Arabia]{.underline}, it [will find itself
between a rock and a hard place -- lose the Chinese market or spark the
**ire of Washington.**]{.underline} On balance, I think [Saudi
Arabia]{.underline} will [compromise]{.underline} by **[accepting the
petro-yuan]{.underline}** for oil exported to China and the Asia-Pacific
countries whilst continuing to accept the petrodollar for exports to the
European Union (EU) and the United States. Even such a compromise
[will]{.underline} still [tip the balance in favour of the petro-yuan
since 75% of Saudi oil exports go to China]{.underline} and the
Asia-Pacific region. For China, there is a lot of upsides to this
gambit. [An oil futures market based in yuan will **stimulate demand for
the Chinese currency**, which China believes will lend it strategic
clout.]{.underline} That money is also [more likely to be recycled back
into the Chinese economy. The US has been able to run huge budget
deficits]{.underline}, borrowing money at extremely low rates [because
of the demand for its currency]{.underline}. Petrodollars continuously
flow back into the US economy, creating investment and economic growth
that might not otherwise occur. The dollar has also long been one of the
premier safe havens for investors around the world. [China would like to
emulate that dynamic.]{.underline}

### Internal Link 

#### The petroyuan kills dollar hegemony \-\-- the U.S. can't properly respond.

**Macleod 18** (Alasdair Macleod, the Head of Research at GoldMoney,
1-10-2018, \"Will the Dollar Survive the Rise of the Yuan and the End of
the Petrodollar?\", Mises Institute,
https://mises.org/wire/will-dollar-survive-rise-yuan-and-end-petrodollar,
accessed 7-2-2019) ml

This might seem a frivolous question, while the dollar still retains its
might, and is universally accepted in preference to other, less stable
fiat currencies. However, [it is becoming clear, at least to independent
monetary observers, that in 2018 the dollar's primacy will be challenged
by the yuan]{.underline} as the pricing medium for energy and other key
industrial commodities. After all, the dollar's role as the legacy trade
medium is no longer appropriate, given that China's trade is now driving
the global economy, not America's. At the very least, if the dollar's
future role diminishes, then there will be surplus dollars, which unless
they are withdrawn from circulation entirely, will result in a lower
dollar on the foreign exchanges. [While it is possible for the Fed to
contract the quantity of base money]{.underline} (indeed this is the
implication of its desire to reduce its balance sheet anyway), [it would
also have to discourage and even reverse the expansion of bank credit,
which would be judged by central bankers to be **economic suicide**. For
that to occur, the US]{.underline} Government itself [would also have
to]{.underline} move firmly and rapidly towards [eliminating its budget
deficit. But that is being deliberately increased by the Trump
administration instead.]{.underline} Explaining the consequences of
these monetary dynamics was the purpose of an essay written by Ludwig
von Mises almost a century ago. At that time, the German hyperinflation
was entering its final phase ahead of the mark's eventual collapse in
November 1923. Von Mises had already helped to stabilize the Austrian
crown, whose own collapse was stabilized at about the time he wrote his
essay, so he wrote with both practical knowledge and authority. [The
dollar]{.underline}, of course, is nowhere near the circumstances faced
by the German mark at that time. However, the [conditions]{.underline}
that led to the mark's collapse [are beginning to resonate with a
familiarity that should serve as an early warning]{.underline}. The
situation, was of course, different. Germany had lost the First World
War and financed herself by printing money. In fact, she started down
that route before the war, seizing upon the new Chartalist doctrine that
money should rightfully be issued by the state, in preference to the
established knowledge that money's validity was determined by markets.
Without abandoning gold for her own state-issued currency, Germany would
never have managed to build and finance her war machine, which she did
by printing currency. The ultimate collapse of the mark was not mainly
due to the Allies' reparations set at the treaty of Versailles, as
commonly thought today, because the inflation had started long before.
The dollar has enjoyed a considerably longer life as an unbacked
state-issued currency than the mark did, but do not think the monetary
factors have been much different. The Bretton Woods agreement, designed
to make the dollar appear "as good as gold", was cover for the US
Government to fund Korea, Vietnam and other foreign ventures by monetary
inflation, which it did without restraint. That deceit ended in 1971,
and today the ratio of an ounce of gold to the dollar has moved to about
1:1310 from the post-war rate of 1:35, giving a loss of the dollar's
purchasing power, measured in the money of the market, of 97.3%. True,
this is not on the hyperinflationary scale of the mark --- yet. Since
the Nixon shock in 1971, the Americans have been adept at perpetuating
the myth of King Dollar, insisting gold now has no monetary role at all.
By cutting a deal with the Saudis in 1974, Nixon and Kissinger ensured
that all energy, and in consequence all other commodities, would
continue to be priced in dollars. Global demand for dollars was assured,
and the banking system of correspondent nostro accounts meant that all
the world's trade was settled in New York through the mighty American
banks. And having printed dollars to ensure higher energy prices would
be paid, they would then be recycled as loan capital to America and her
friends. [The world had been bought, and anyone not prepared to accept
US monetary and military domination would pay the price. That was until
now. **The dollar's hegemony is being directly challenged by**
**China**, which is not shy about promoting her own currency as her
preferred settlement medium]{.underline}. Later this month [an oil
futures contract priced in yuan is expected to start trading in
Shanghai]{.underline}.1 Only last week, the Governor of China's central
bank met the Saudi finance minister, presumably to agree, amongst other
topics, the date **[when Saudi Arabia will start to accept yuan for oil
sales to China]{.underline}**. The proximity of these two developments
certainly suggest they are closely related, and that the end of the
Nixon/Saudi deal of 1974, which created the petrodollar, is in sight. Do
not underestimate the importance of this development, because it
[**marks the beginning of a new monetary era**, which will be
increasingly understood to be **post-dollar**]{.underline}. The
commencement of the new yuan for oil futures contract may seem a small
crack in the dollar's edifice, but [it is almost certainly the beginning
of its shattering]{.underline}. America's response to China's monetary
maneuvring has always been that of a nation on the back foot. For the
last year, the yuan has been rising against the dollar, following
President Trump's inauguration. Instead of responding to China's
hegemonic threat by increasing America's role in foreign trade,
[President Trump has threatened all and sundry with trade restrictions
and punitive tariffs. It is a policy which could not be more designed to
undermine America's global economic status, and with it the role of the
dollar]{.underline}. In monetary terms, this leads us to a further
important parallel with Germany nearly a century ago, and that is the
contraction of the territory and population over which the mark was
legal tender then, and the acceptance of the dollar today. The loss of
Germany's colonies in Asia and Africa, Alsace-Lorraine to France, and
large parts of Prussia to Poland, reduced the population that used the
mark without a compensating reduction of the quantity of marks in
circulation. Until very recently, most of the world was America's
monetary colony, and in that context, she is losing Asia, the Middle
East and some countries in Africa as well. The territory that offers
fealty to the dollar is definitely contracting, just as it did for the
German mark after 1918, and as it did for the Austro-Hungarians, whose
Austrian crown suffered a similar fate. The relative slowness of the
dollar's decline so far should not fool us. The factors that led to the
collapse of the German mark in 1923 are with us in our fiat currencies
today. As Mises put it, If the practice persists of covering government
deficits with the issue of notes, then the day will come without fail,
sooner or later, when the monetary systems of those nations pursuing
this course will break down completely. Updated for today's monetary
system, this is precisely how the American government finances itself.
Instead of printing notes, it is the expansion of bank credit, issued by
banks licensed by the government with this purpose in mind, that ends up
being subscribed for government bonds. The same methods are employed by
all advanced nations, giving us a worrying global dimension to the
ultimate failure of fiat currencies, whose only backing is confidence in
the issuers. Now that America is being forced back from the post-war,
post-Nixon-shock strategy of making the dollar indispensable for global
trade, the underlying monetary inflation of decades will almost
certainly begin to be reflected in the foreign and commodity exchanges.
There is little to stand in the way of the global fiat monetary system,
led by the dollar, to begin a breakdown in its purchasing power, as
prophesied by Mises nearly a century ago. [Whether other currencies
follow the dollar down the rabbit hole of diminishing purchasing power
will to a large extent depend on the management of the currencies
concerned]{.underline} How a Fiat Currency Dies The last thing anyone
owning units of a state-issued currency will admit to is that they may
be valueless. Only long after it has become clear to an educated
impartial monetary observer that this is the case, will they abandon the
currency and get rid of it for anything while someone else will still
take it in exchange for goods. In the case of the German hyperinflation,
it was probably only in the last six months or so that the general
public finally abandoned the mark, despite its legal status as money.
Mises reported that throughout the monetary collapse, until only the
final months, there persists a general belief that the collapse in the
currency would soon end, there always being a shortage of it. The change
in this attitude was marked by the moment people no longer just bought
what they needed ahead of actually needing it. Instead, they began to
buy anything, just to get rid of the currency. This final phase is what
Mises called the crack-up boom, though some far-sighted individuals had
already acted well ahead of the crowd. Both these phases are still ahead
for the American citizen. However, we can now anticipate how the first
is likely to start, and that will be through dollars in foreign hands
being replaced for trade purposes with the yuan, and then sold into the
foreign exchanges. Once the process starts, triggered perhaps by the
petrodollar's loss of its trade settlement monopoly, it is not beyond
the bounds of possibility for the dollar to initially lose between a
third and a half of its purchasing power against a basket of
commodities, and a similar amount against the yuan, which is likely to
be managed by the Chinese to retain its purchasing power. It will be in
the interests of the Chinese authorities to promote the yuan as a
sounder currency than the dollar to further encourage foreign traders to
abandon the dollar. From China's point of view, a stronger yuan would
also help ensure price stability in her domestic markets, at a time when
countries choosing to remain on a dollar-linked monetary policy will be
struggling with rising price inflation. There then emerges a secondary
problem for the dollar. A fiat currency depends in large measure for its
value on the credibility of the issuer. A weakening dollar, and the bear
market in bonds that accompanies it, will undermine the US Government's
finances, in turn further eroding the government's financial
credibility. This will be happening after an extended period of the US
Government being able to finance its deficits at artificially low
interest rates, and is therefore unprepared for this radical change in
circumstances. As the dollar's purchasing power comes under attack,
lenders, whether they be those with surplus funds, or their banks acting
as their agents, will increasingly take into account the declining
purchasing power of the dollar in setting a loan rate. In other words,
time-preference will again begin to dominate forward rates, and not
central bank interest rate policy. This will be reflected in a
significantly steeper yield curve in the bond market, forcing borrowers
into very short-term financing or using other, more stable monetary
media to obtain capital for longer-term projects. This, again, plays
into [the yuan becoming the preferred currency, possibly **with a
rapidity that will be unexpected.** The US Government is obviously
ill-equipped for this drastic change in its circumstances]{.underline}.
The correct response is to eliminate its budget deficit entirely, and
refuse to bail out failing banks and businesses. Bankruptcies will be
required to send surplus dollars to money heaven and therefore stabilise
the dollar's purchasing power[. A change in the Fed's attitude towards
its banks and currency is, however, as unlikely as that of the
Reichsbank subsequent to the Versailles Treaty.]{.underline} Therefore,
it follows that [capital markets in dollars will inevitably be severely
disrupted, and **market participants will seek
alternatives**.]{.underline} Remember that the dollar's strength has
been based on its function in trade settlement and its subsequent
deployment as the international monetary capital of choice. [Both these
functions can be expected to go into reverse as the trade settlement
function is undermined.]{.underline} Whether China will be tempted to
employ the same methods in future to support the yuan as the Americans
have during the last forty-three years for the dollar, remains to be
seen. It may not be a trick that can be repeated. [There is a great
danger that a significant fall in the dollar will lead to global
economic stagnation, coupled with escalating price inflation, affecting
many of China's trading partners]{.underline}. China will want to
insulate herself from these dangers without adding to them by going for
full-blown hegemony. We are beginning, perhaps, to see this reflected in
rising prices for gold and silver. China has effectively cornered the
market for physical gold, the only sound money of the market that over
millennia has survived all attempts by governments to replace it. [Her
central planners appear to have long been aware of the West's Achilles'
heel in its monetary affairs, and have merely been playing along to
China's own advantage]{.underline}. As the dollar weakens in the coming
years, her wisdom in securing for herself and her citizens the one form
of money that's no one else's liability will ensure her survival in
increasingly turbulent times. Now that's strategic thinking.

[**The petro-yuan could be a death blow for an already weakened US**
dollar and the emergence of the yuan as the **dominant world
currency**]{.underline}. Back in 2015, [the first of a number of
strikes]{.underline} against the petrodollar [was dealt by
Russia]{.underline}. Gazprom Neft, the third-largest oil producer in
Russia, decided to move away from the dollar towards the yuan and other
Asian currencies. [Iran followed suit]{.underline} the same year using
the yuan with a host of other foreign currencies in trade, including
payment for Iranian oil. 6 [During the same year China also developed
its Silk Road, while the yuan was beginning to establish more dominance
in the European markets]{.underline}. A death blow that began in 2015
hit again in 2017 when China became the world's largest importer of
crude oil (see Chart2) Chart 2 [With major oil exporters finally having
**a viable way to circumvent the petrodollar system**, the US economy

**strong and steady decline in the dollar's value**]{.underline}. [The
petrodollar]{.underline} is backed by Treasuries, so it can help [fuel

currencies]{.underline}. Contrast this with a petro-yuan convertible to
gold. [The launching of the petro-yuan could be a **"wake up call"** for
the United States. Moving]{.underline} oil trade out of the petrodollar
[into the petro-yuan could take initially between **\$600 billion and

primary goal. Everything else is secondary.

[The great rivalry between the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[and China will shape the 21st century]{.underline}. It is a truth
universally acknowledged that [a great power will never voluntarily
surrender pride of place to a challenger. The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is the pre-eminent great power. China is now its
challenger. 30]{.underline} During his election campaign, Donald Trump
repeatedly castigated China accusing it of gaining an unfair trading
edge with the United States by manipulating its currency, threatening to
slap tariffs on Chinese exports and announcing his intention to withdrew
from the Trans-Pacific Partnership which he eventually did. He even
mused about ending the "One China" policy that governs the US policy
vis-à-vis Taiwan. 31 [The launching of the crude oil benchmark on the
Shanghai exchange could mark **the beginning of the end of the
petrodollar**. The United States is not going to take this potential
threat lying down.]{.underline} The [imposition of tariffs on Chinese
goods could be the first shots in the **petroyuan/petrodollar war of
attrition**]{.underline}. If a trade war between China and the United
States erupts, [China]{.underline} will not run from a fight with the
United States and [will retaliate]{.underline} by imposing its own
sanctions on US exports. And to punish the United States financially,
China could also offload its holdings of US Treasury bills estimated at
\$1.3 trillion. 32 [A confident China buoyed by the success of its crude
oil futures contract and an America enraged by the dollar loss of its
coveted reserve status make a **toxic combination where some kind of
miscalculation or accident is more likely**. With tensions running high,
US military leaders in the Pacific should prepare for even more
aggressive action from Chinese naval and air forces]{.underline},
possibly risking a repeat of the April 2001 collision between a Chinese
fighter jet and a US Navy surveillance plane. 33 There are good reasons,
however, why a confrontation between China and the United States might
not take place. Both great powers are aware that they risk losing so
much from any conflict between them. And it will be more difficult to
contain the aftermath of any new accident between them. In time,
President Trump will realize that China will not bend the knee before
him and stop his trade war against China and above all let the
petro-yuan and the petrodollar find their places in a global oil market
estimated at \$14 trilion. This is far better than damaging the global
economy and themselves by a trade war. Still, the [Sino-American
relationship will increasingly run into trouble as the American leaders
will hardly give up their hegemonic policy or 'unipolar'
status]{.underline}. And should a conflict arises, [China
knows]{.underline} that [it has]{.underline} in its arsenal [a very
**special strategic partnership with Russia,**]{.underline} which will
remain a healthy check on Washington's "unipolar folly". 34
[China-Russia ties are at their best and will remain stable for a very
long time]{.underline}. Observers in the West tend to underestimate the
solid foundation of the current Chinese-Russian relationship. The
intimacy between Beijing and Moscow is often referred to as a "marriage
of convenience." Both Beijing and Moscow, however, rank their ties as
the "peak" in mutual history. This can be judged by two analytical
frameworks: their converging visions of the future world order and their
harmonized national interests. [Russia and China share a strategic
vision against the unipolar world: both see the United States in
relative decline and the world already becoming multipolar]{.underline}.
In the process of mismanaging its decline, the US suffers from a
psychological problem that manifests itself in the unfounded fear of
power challenge from potential rivals, hence its persistent attempts to
hinder their rise. The world is changing and the world order must be
revamped. Pax Americana is over and Washington must adjust to the new
world. 35 Coincidentally, the Chinese view on the world order at this
historical juncture is shared and dovetailed by Putin's Russia. [Both
sides hold the view that Washington's alienation from both Beijing and
Moscow is reflected by the deeply rooted fear of the US losing hegemonic
status as the "only indispensable superpower".]{.underline} The
indications of the US fear are plenty. From Beijing's point of view, the
US decision to restart a Cold War containment strategy with the pivot
towards Asia was driven by misguided fear. From Moscow's perspective,
the Western alliance took advantage of post-Soviet chaos to push the
Western sphere of influence towards the Russian border. In sharp
contrast to mutual suspicion and deteriorating relationship between
Washington and Beijing, the Chinese-Russian tie has proved to be a
stable strategic partnership built on mutual understanding, respect and
national interests.

[One of the most brilliant aspects of the petrodollar system was
requesting]{.underline} that [oilproducing nations take their excess oil
profits and place them into **US debt securities**. This]{.underline}
system [would]{.underline} later [become known as **"petrodollar
recycling"** as coined by Henry Kissinger. Through]{.underline} their
[exclusive use of dollars for oil transactions, and then depositing
their excess profits into American debt securities, the petrodollar
system is **a \"dream come true\" for a spendthrift government** like
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. This has
[enabled]{.underline} the United States to maintain [**artificially low
interest rates**. The US economy has become dependent upon
these]{.underline} artificially low interest rates and, therefore, has a
vested interest in maintaining them through any means necessary. [The
**massive economic distortions and imbalances** generated by the
petrodollar system]{.underline} will eventually self-correct when the
artificial dollar and US debt demand is removed. That day is coming.
Another major benefit of the petrodollar system has to do with the
actual purchase of oil itself. [With oil priced in US dollars, America
can literally print money to buy oil and then have the oil producers
hold the debt that was created by printing the money in the first
place]{.underline}. What other nation, besides America, can print money
to buy oil?

Defending the Petrodollar System [Since the dawn of the oil age, the
geopolitical strategies concocted by developed nations have increasingly
been centred on maintaining easy access to the world's oil
supplies]{.underline}. And while most nations have a clear motivation to
maintain easy access to the world's cheapest oil supplies out of sheer
economic necessity, this is certainly not the sole concern for the
United States. [The United States has an additional unique incentive
regarding the world's oil, namely, ensuring that all oil]{.underline}
around the globe, both current supplies and future discoveries, [remain
priced in US dollars]{.underline}. A simple examination of America's
foreign policy efforts in the wake of the 'oil shock' of 1973 and in the
ensuing foundation of the petrodollar system, makes it painstakingly
clear to any casual political observer that a central goal of Washington
has been to control global oil supplies, specifically in the Middle
East. [After the 1973 'oil shock',]{.underline} former president
[Nixon]{.underline} warned US citizens "that American military
intervention to protect vital oil supplies" in the region, was a strong
possibility. This speech marked the first official and formal commitment
to [deploy US troops to the Middle East for the explicit reason of
protecting America's oil interests.]{.underline} On 23 January 1980,
former US president [Jimmy Carter]{.underline} proclaimed in his State
of the Union Address the "Carter Doctrine" which [stated]{.underline}
that [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates wo[uld use military
force]{.underline} if necessary [to defend]{.underline} its [national
interests in the Persian Gulf]{.underline}. It was a response to the
Soviet Union's intervention in Afghanistan in 1979 and was [intended to
**deter the Soviet Union**]{.underline} from threatening oil supplies
from the Middle East. By January 1, 1983, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [created]{.underline} the Central Command
([CENTCOM]{.underline}), currently based in Qatar, with the stated
mission of [acting as a **deterrent (primarily against the Soviets**)
and to help **maintain regional stability** and the flow of
oil]{.underline} from the Arab Gulf to the United States and other
western allies . After all, [maintaining a global order dependent upon a
"dollars for oil" system is no cheap task and requires careful
monitoring and oversight of the world's oil supplies]{.underline}. Chief
among the potential concerns for the petrodollar guardians are: threats
of restrictions on oil supplies and, perhaps most importantly, devising
"permanent solutions" to the problems presented by nations who dare
challenge the current "dollars for oil" system.

[There have been attempts to move off dollar-denominated oil trading at
various times]{.underline}. The EU has successfully negotiated oil
supply contracts denominated at least partially in Euros, and could no
doubt increase the weight of these in international transactions.3 [As
China has risen to become the world's largest oil importer, so its
capacity to insist on oil purchases denominated in yuan (RMB) has
grown]{.underline}. Already [**China-Russian oil contracts are largely
denominated in yuan, while Iran, Iraq, Venezuela and Indonesia also
follow** this practice to varying degrees in their dealings with
China]{.underline} and Russia.4 In September 2018 the chairman of the
Iraqi-Iranian Chamber of Commerce, Yahya al-Ishaq, told the news agency
Mehr that the two countries are now using their own national currencies
as well as the euro in bilateral trade.5 [It is widely reported that
**Saudi Arabia may be about to follow suit**, at least for Chinese
purchases of oil]{.underline}. This means that already [a significant
proportion of the global oil market is being traded in Chinese yuan with
**more to follow**]{.underline}. Of course these all represent bilateral
trade deals; there is no suggestion as yet that the yuan is being
utilized in multilateral trading arrangements, which would represent a
stronger competitive threat for the dollar. China has emerged as a
significant oil trader as it moves to occupy the center of the world
manufacturing system. Fig. 1 reveals how China has risen in terms of
manufacturing value-added to become prime manufacturing nation by 2010,
having overtaken Germany in the year 2000, Japan in 2006 and the US in
2010.6 The next Figure 2 reveals the complementary development whereby
[China has overtaken the US to become the world's largest importer of
oil as a single country.7 This makes **China's targeting of the oil
market as an arena for yuan-dollar competition of strategic
significance.**]{.underline} \[figured omitted\] [As China's
significance in the global oil market grows, so its choice of oil
suppliers correspondingly grows in significance]{.underline}. Fig. 3
reveals that Russia has now become China's largest supplier, displacing
Saudi Arabia, while Angola, Iran, Iraq and Oman remain large suppliers.8
\[figured omitted\] [Russia]{.underline}, which has emerged as China's
largest oil supplier, acc[epts Chinese RMB (the yuan) in payment. Iran
is also reported to accept yuan in payment for oil -- thus evading US
sanctions]{.underline} that came into effect at the beginning of
November this year. China in August was reported to be rejecting US
proposals that it curb its imports of oil from Iran -- and as noted
above it received a six-month waiver of sanctions due to take effect at
the beginning of November.9 [**Angola** is China's third largest
supplier -- and it not only accepts yuan in payment for oil, but indeed
it made the Chinese yuan its second currency in 2015, shifting firmly
into China's yuan-denominated circle of countries]{.underline}.10
[**Venezuela** likewise counts itself as part of the yuan sphere, and
has been]{.underline} accepting yuan in payment for oil supplies [since
2017]{.underline}. These are all bilateral trading relations; they do
not involve multilateral acceptance of the yuan, as yet. As these
countries move into the yuan-denominated sphere, so the pressure on
other countries (particularly Saudi Arabia) to accept the yuan for
Chinese sales also rises -- as its sales to China are sliding relative
to those of other non-OPEC countries.[11 In this way, a **significant
proportion of oil sales can be expected to be denominated in yuan**
rather than US dollars -- possibly as early as the end of
2018]{.underline}.12 These direct sales in yuan are likely to be
stabilized by the launch of the oil futures contract on the Shanghai INE
in March this year.

[**The Shanghai oil futures contract** An oil futures
contract]{.underline} is a contract that sp[ecifies a future delivery of
a standard quantity of oil, of a specified quality (or grade) at a
specified price]{.underline}. Such a contract allows both sellers and
buyers to hedge against future price movements, thus ensuring certainty
and stability. [The futures market for oil is the bedrock of stability
in the commodities markets, which underpin global industry and
manufacturing]{.underline}.13 [The]{.underline} oil futures [contracts
are specified on the Shanghai International Energy exchange (INE) in
terms of their date of issue and dates within which the oil must be
supplied]{.underline}. For example the contract SC1811 specifies a
listing date as 26 March 2018, an expiration date of 31 Oct 2018, and
delivery dates ranging between 1 Nov 2018 and 7 November 2018, with a
benchmark price of RMB 416 for the volume of oil specified in the
contract. A second example would be the contract SC1812 (meaning the
contract for December 2018), where the delivery dates range from 3
December to 7 December 2018, with benchmark price also set at RMB 416.14

declined from 70% to 57% of trades over the same period]{.underline}.15
A more recent article published by Nikkei Asian Review reported that
sales of Shanghai oil futures contracts [by the end of September had
reached 16% of all contracts issued globally, while sales of WTI
standard futures fell to 52% from 60% and those of Brent crude fell from
38% to 32]{.underline}%.16 An initial analysis of intra-day trading
patterns indicates that the volume of trades and their volatility are in
line with international experience. It is also significant that [the INE
futures contract is **the first on Chinese commodity markets** to be
eligible for trading by foreign players]{.underline}, and indeed it
remains open until the early hours of the morning in China to allow for
ease of trading from New York and Chicago. The same analysis of
intra-day trading detected evidence of significant US trading
interest.17 [The launch of an oil futures contract]{.underline}, with
full state backing as in this case, [is a **rare and notable event**.
China has waited for the best part of 25 years for this
moment]{.underline} -- ever since it launched a failed attempt to use
the RMB in oil trading in the early 1990s. This e[arly
initiative]{.underline} failed for lack of transparency and liquidity;
it [was premature for China to attempt to challenge the US dollar
hegemony]{.underline} and its centrality in financial and trade (and
particularly commodities trade) transactions. [**This time around**
China has learnt from these early mis-steps]{.underline} and from
earlier failed initiatives by other powers -- such as the attempt by
Oman to launch a dollar-denominated oil futures contract from Dubai in
2007, which never attracted sufficient liquidity to claim more than a
token presence in the oil trade market. [The other significant feature
of the Shanghai oil futures contract is that **it builds on the prior
launch by Beijing of a yuan-denominated gold futures market in Hong
Kong** in July 2017. This ensures that oil traders can, if they wish,
exchange their yuan as secured on the oil markets for gold]{.underline}.
It is also relevant that China has been an assiduous collector of the
world's gold over the past several years. Thus the gold convertibility
of the yuan-based oil futures contract is ensured. Possible
ramifications of the petroyuan While [the]{.underline} launching of a
[futures contract on the Shanghai INE]{.underline} might be a small step
for China, it [represents a **giant leap for the global trading
system**]{.underline}. The key to the success of this Chinese initiative
is to provide liquidity and convertibility -- both of which China has
been careful to provide.18 [Oil traders can hedge their purchases with
the oil future contract, which is denominated not just in Chinese yuan
but also in underlying grades of oil that reflect Chinese trading
preferences. In this way the Shanghai crude oil futures contract
promises to **become a global benchmark** alongside the European
standard in the form of Brent crude futures contract traded in London
and the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures contract traded in
New York]{.underline}. Of course, this promise is being buffeted by
Trump trade sanctions, against both China and Iran and Russia, and this
complicates the emergence of the petroyuan, possibly halting its rise or
derailing it. [The launch of the futures contract can be **anticipated
to widen the scope for yuan-denominated trading**, both in oil and in
other commodities]{.underline}. As [more of China's oil import bill
comes to be priced in yuan, so foreign suppliers will have more
yuan-denominated accounts with which they can purchase]{.underline} both
[Chinese goods and]{.underline} Chinese [services]{.underline}, but
[also]{.underline} Chinese [government securities and
bond]{.underline}s, thus **[strengthening the Chinese capital markets
and promoting the internationalization of the yuan]{.underline}** [--
**or at least the progressive de-dollarization** of the oil
market]{.underline}. The launch of the futures contract means that
[countries selling oil to China will be accumulating billions of Chinese
yuan which they will then be looking to recycle back to China through
purchases of Chinese goods and technologies or purchases of Chinese
government bonds, thus **strengthening the yuan as an international
reserve currency**]{.underline}. It can be anticipated that [this will
lead other countries wishing to engage in yuan-denominated
trade]{.underline}, and for other commodity markets after oil becoming
subject to similar trends. In this way, [the launch of the Shanghai
futures oil contract and its acceptance by the market could actively
contribute to the internationalization of the yuan, and the further rise
of China in the global financial system]{.underline}. These are points
brought out in the investors' report issued by Union Bank of Switzerland
(UBS) in April 2018, after the launch of the Shanghai oil futures
contract.19

The rise (and longevity) of the petrodollar [The emergent strategy of
pricing a new oil futures contract in yuan is a **smart move by China in
that it seeks to** **recapitulate the steps that led the US dollar to
its current position of dominance** in foreign currency
markets]{.underline}. As outlined by scholars such as Barry Eichengreen
and Eric Helleiner the US dollar rose to prominence quite rapidly in the
early 20th century, and its position was consolidated at the Bretton
Woods conference of 1944, designed to lay out the post-war financial
order.20 At this conference the choice was between an international unit
of account (the bancor, favoured by Keynes and Britain) and the US
dollar tied to gold. The US won that debate, and the dollar remained
tied to gold until the 1970s when enormous US balance of payments
deficits put the dollar under great stress and countries started to
insist on redeeming their dollar holdings in gold. This put a strain on
US gold reserves until Nixon broke the dollar-gold nexus in 1971. It was
only with the US-Saudi agreement of the early 1970s that Saudi oil sales
would all be denominated in US dollars, in exchange for US guarantees to
provide armaments and underwrite Saudi security, that the dollar came to
occupy a genuinely central role in world commodities trade. The US was
in the fortunate position following 1974 that it could pay the new high
prices for oil (provoked by the OPEC cartel) in its own currency, while
other countries making oil purchases would have to do so in dollars.
These countries therefore faced the challenge of building their own
dollar reserves, while excess dollars in the system (the so-called
"petrodollars") were recycled back to the US (as well as other markets)
where they were used to buy US goods or to purchase US government
securities (treasuries). This in turn increased demand for the
securities and so reduced interest rates. These have been the factors
that have underpinned US dollar hegemony for the past four decades
following the 1974 US-Saudi agreement. The precise steps in this process
that allowed the US dollar to continue its Bretton Woods dominance even
after the severing of the dollar-gold link by Nixon in 1971 ("closing
the gold window") can be traced as follows. In 1975, the member states
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) announced
their decision to invoice oil sales to all customers in US dollars.21
This momentous decision had been foreshadowed by US-Saudi agreements, in
particular the setting up of the US-Saudi Joint Commission on Economic
Cooperation, in 1974. These agreements were followed up by a Saudi
undertaking to recycle their US dollar earnings (petrodollars) in the
purchase of US Treasury bills -- making Saudi Arabia the largest holder
of US government debt of any of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
countries. As David Spiro argued in a celebrated study published in
1999, this was the real driver of the dollar's continued hegemony,
building on the fact that oil sales were to be invoiced in dollars.22
The Saudis were rewarded with prime coverage by the US security umbrella
and sales of US military weapons. This basic understanding, that oil
would be invoiced in US dollars by all OPEC states, for all customers,
in return for coverage by the US security umbrella, endured for decades
-- and only started to unravel with the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 and
subsequent turmoil and US wars and the establishment of military bases
throughout the Middle East and Central Asia. [It was precisely the
**absence of a Chinese strategy** to internationalize the yuan (or
rather de-dollarize the international system]{.underline} pivoting on
the oil trade) [via the medium of a revamped SDR system that had
**earlier condemned the strategy to failure**]{.underline}. Perhaps, as
argued by Barry Eichengreen and Guangtao Xia, [the revamping of SDRs as
a strategy was utilized by reformers in China as a cover for
liberalization of the financial system at home]{.underline}.23 But the
more that China was forced to import oil, from the early years of the
21st century, the more the SDR-based strategy appeared unsustainable.
[As China emerged as the world's largest oil importer in 2017, China's
leadership recognized **the opportunity for its oil purchases to be
conducted increasingly in yuan**]{.underline}.24 [This
strategy]{.underline}, which was pursued behind closed doors and [did
not emerge into the open until 2018 with the launch of the Shanghai oil
futures contract and direct purchases of oil in yuan by China from major
suppliers like Russia, Angola and Iran, has now emerged as **key to yuan
internationalization**. It represents **a total departure from the
failed strategy** of internationalization via SDRs, and indeed
replicates the earlier strategy of the US to place the dollar at the
center of the international financial system]{.underline}, because of
its use in oil trading, **[updated to the 21st century]{.underline}**.

#### Even if the petroyuan isn't achieved, de-dollarization is inevitable.

Internationalization of the yuan -- or de-dollarization? Fo[r the past
decade China has been pursuing a strategy for internationalization of
the yuan involving greater reliance on the IMF's]{.underline} Special
Drawing Rights ([SDRs) as an alternative international reserve
currency]{.underline}.25 The strategy was laid out in a famous essay
published by People's Bank of China governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, in 2009
(Zhou 2009). The idea was that with new allocations of SDRs to emerging
industrial powers like China, the SDR could not only serve as a
development tool but also as a means of international payment that would
provide an alternative to the US dollar. This was in fact a
long-standing policy position on the part of China, but in the wake of
the 2008 global financial crisis an SDR-centered international financial
system loomed as a particularly enticing prospect for China. Zhou's 2009
essay galvanized these efforts, as he pointed to the evident weaknesses
and inadequacies of the dollar-centered system (such as the impact of US
deficits) and outlined the advantages of the SDR as an alternative means
of international financial settlement. [Now the moves to introduce
yuan-based trading in the oil markets, and]{.underline} possible further
developments of yuan-based trade in [other commodity markets, means that
**the US dollar faces unprecedented challenges to its
hegemony**]{.underline} and may in the near future no longer be seen as
the anchor of the international monetary system. To paraphrase
Eichengreen, [this could be interpreted as bringing to an end the
"exorbitant privilege" enjoyed by the US on account of this dollar
centrality]{.underline} in international trade. Rather than viewing
China's moves as focused on internationalizing the yuan, [it
is]{.underline} probably [safer to view them more prosaically as aimed
at **de-dollarization of the international system** -- a move long
favoured by China]{.underline}. [The oil market initiatives this time
are **complemented and supported by other foreign policy initiatives**,
particularly]{.underline} the creation of a yuan-centered trading and
investment system via the [Belt and Road Initiative (BRI]{.underline}).
This initiative is widely viewed as one of the largest infrastructure
investment projects ever launched -- and as such promotes Chinese
investment and financial institutions to play a more significant role on
the international stage. An important Chinese aim for the BRI [as well
as the associated financial institutions, the BRICS New Development Bank
(NDB) (to some extent) and the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank
(AIIB)]{.underline}, is to [promote the use of the Chinese currency
(yuan]{.underline}, or RMB) [as a vehicle of trade]{.underline}. While
it has long been a strategic goal of China to internationalize the yuan,
until recently the trading volumes have worked against this, as did the
limited convertibility of the RMB. Now with the BRI the conditions for
internationalization are much more favorable. [The countries aligned
with China through the BRI form a **significant monetary bloc**, and are
already accepting the yuan as payment for commodities supplied to China,
and as means of payment for goods supplied from China]{.underline}. In
Pakistan with its large China Pakistan Economic Corridor the yuan is
already the dominant currency held by the central bank in its reserves.
At the end of June 2018, the cumulative total of China's commodity trade
with countries aligned with the BRI reached the equivalent of US\$5
trillion -- with the yuan being the primary vehicle for this enormous
trade volume.26 According to the HSBC, the BRI is likely to add an extra
\$2.5 trillion in new trade internationally each year.27 [BRI trade and
investment]{.underline} conducted in yuan promises to promote not only
Chinese economic growth and financial clout but also its geopolitical
influence and soft power while [serv]{.underline}ing [as a means for
countries to evade US sanctions. Both Russia and Iran are selling oil to
China and accepting payment in yuan]{.underline}, as a response to
(actual and potential) sanctions imposed on these countries by the US.
They also have extensive imports from China as well as other reasons for
seeking strengthened ties. [China also views the emergence of
yuan-denominated oil contracts as a means for Chinese companies to buy
oil and gas in their own currency, thereby avoiding exposure to foreign
currency fluctuations]{.underline}.28 Given that China is now the
world's largest oil importer as well as its leading trading and
manufacturing nation, these initiatives frame the emergence of a
multipolar world. Much discussion has focused on the prospects for the
Euro as a currency to be traded in oil markets -- so far a possibility
not exploited or promoted with any vigour by the EU. But if pursued
strongly the euro could well play the role of an alternative currency
for invoicing of oil sales, and as such it has been explored by
countries such as Iran as well as the countries of the Euroland.29
Central to this argument was the role that North Sea oil producers,
Norway and the UK, could have played in such an eventuality. That
opportunity has now passed. But the new contender is the yuan. While it
is premature to see the yuan displacing the US dollar anytime soon, [the
prospect of yuan trading in oil]{.underline} (and subsequently in other
commodity markets) [appears to be off to a strong start]{.underline}.
There is the [oil futures contract]{.underline} now being [traded
strongly]{.underline} on the INE [in Shangha]{.underline}i. There is the
[bilateral trading in oil]{.underline} between China and oil suppliers[,
in yuan]{.underline} -- where Russia, Iran and Venezuela are the lead
countries so far. There is [the gold convertibility of the yuan-based
oil futures contracts]{.underline}. And there is the
[grade-specification of the futures contract]{.underline} that is better
aligned with Asian oil consumption patterns than the existing
international standards, Brent crude and WTI. Against these positive
signs there are the negatives that the introduction of the
yuan-denominated oil contract is now complicated by the imposition of US
sanctions against Iran and Russia and by wider trade sanctions imposed
by the Trump administration against China. While these could have an
unexpected effect in accelerating China's move away from the US dollar
in oil trades, they could also have a decidedly negative impact if China
is induced to move away from Irani oil imports. Thus the outcome is
likely to be the result of conflicting forces. One reading, whose
plausibility is argued in this article, is that yuan-denominated oil
trading is likely to become more significant, partially displacing US
dollar oil trading in one market after another. On the other hand there
is much momentum behind the incumbent hegemony of the US dollar and the
practice of invoicing oil sales in dollars. What can be said is that
[the **shift from a dollar-dominated world towards a multi-polar world
order is now well underway.**]{.underline}

[China\'s recent introduction of yuan-denominated oil futures has
attracted some fairly extensive press commentary]{.underline}. Partly
this is down to a habit of over-interpreting everything happening in
China as just more evidence of their unstoppable rise to global
superpower status, but it is also due to some profound misconceptions
about the importance of oil as a commodity. It is widely thought, for
example, that oil somehow underwrites the global financial system and
guarantees the U.S. dollar\'s hegemonic status. [Inevitably, stories
about the toppling of the \"Petro-dollar\"]{.underline} and the long
yearned for rise of an alternative reserve currency, one not dependent
on the whims of a capricious political elite in Washington, [have
proliferated across the alter-net]{.underline} and on the state-backed
media platforms of Russia and China. [But we should be clear: **the
Petro-dollar does not exist**, and really hasn\'t done in any meaningful
way since the 1970s, **therefore the \"Petro-yuan\" has no
future**]{.underline}. This is not to say that oil will never be traded
in yuan, that is likely, but it is to say that trading oil in yuan will
not suddenly transform the currency into the global reserve many claim
is inevitable. Origins Of The Petro-Dollar [The **myth of the
Petro-dollar** comes from efforts in the 1970s to prevent the U.S.
suffering severe negative effects in its balance of payments from rising
oil prices]{.underline}. Until the late 1960s the U.S. had been an
oil-exporter, but by also being an oil consumer they had never sought to
maximize the rent from oil production by driving prices upwards. OPEC
countries, however, never had such qualms and when the opportunity arose
as the U.S. became an importer, happily restrained supply to drive
prices, and their own national incomes, higher. [The U.S. was worried
about the resultant trade deficit caused by suddenly having to pay vast
amounts for necessary imports, and so secured the agreement of Saudi
Arabia to only trade oil in U.S. dollars, meaning the U.S. could pay for
oil in their own currency. Saudi Arabia]{.underline}, for their part,
[accumulated huge reserves of U.S. dollars, investing some of them back
into the U.S. economy.]{.underline} The enormous lake of U.S. dollars
this created augmented the role of the dollar as the global reserve
currency, being a highly liquid, easily-exchanged claim on the products,
services and investment potential generated by the U.S. economy. But
this was merely one step in the rise of the greenback as the global
reserve. [The next step came when other economies--East Asia in
particular--followed the lead of the oil producers and also built up
huge reserves of U.S. dollars, all of which was made possible by the
abandonment of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system in the early
1970s]{.underline}. This practice helped to keep exchange rates for
exporters low, and kept a lid on inflation in the U.S., which suited
everyone up to a point. Future Petro-Yuan? Bringing this up to date, it
was a long time ago when the link between oil and the dollar mattered
much at all beyond the financial returns of non-dollar based oil
companies. Since the 1980s, the dollar has been consolidated as the
global reserve currency because of the strength and dynamism of the U.S.
economy, and oil exporters have demanded to be paid in U.S. dollars
because that\'s the currency they prefer to hold on to. To do otherwise
is to take on exchange risk[. Exporters can, and routinely do, accept
payment in whatever exchange medium they wish \-- tanks, planes and
construction services \-- but their central banks demand dollars for
reasons entirely unconnected to oil]{.underline}. Because the U.S.
dollar is a hard currency, easily exchangeable, underwritten by the U.S.
taxpayer, and founded upon decades of broadly consistent macro-economic
policy management. [Those who believe that oil being traded in U.S.
dollars gives the U.S. economy a unique advantage in the global economy
have it **exactly the wrong way around**. The U.S. economy is the
central economy in the global system because it is the most open,
innovative, and productive economy in the world]{.underline}, and
because of this, the U.S. dollar is the most convenient, liquid and
reliable medium of exchange. [One can imagine another currency
challenging it at some point in the future, but only on the basis of the
openness of its underlying economy, and the depth of the capital markets
denominated in it. And if the euro can\'t do it yet, why does anyone
imagine the yuan is up to the job? Furthermore, the U.S. dollar\'s
position as the global reserve currency has been underwritten by Chinese
economic policy. China has deliberately built up a huge pile of U**.S.
dollar-denominated reserves** which]{.underline}, contrary to much press
coverage and occasional threats of a big selloff from China, **[confirms
rather than undermines the dollar\'s status]{.underline}**.

#### China will force Saudi to adopt the petro-yuan.

**Meredith 17** (Sam Meredith, citing Carl Weinberg, chief economist and
managing director at High Frequency Economics, told CNBC, 10-11-2017,
"China will 'compel' Saudi Arabia to trade oil in yuan --- and that's
going to affect the US dollar", CNBC,

[**China will "compel" Saudi Arabia to trade oil** in yuan and, when
this happens, **the rest of the oil market will follow suit** and
abandon the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency, a leading
economist told CNBC]{.underline} on Monday. [Carl **Weinberg, chief
economist and managing director at High Frequency Economics**, said
Beijing stands to become the most dominant global player in oil
demand]{.underline} since China usurped the U.S. as the "biggest oil
importer on the planet." Saudi Arabia has "to pay attention to this
because even as much as [one or two years from now, Chinese demand will
dwarf U.S. demand]{.underline}," Weinberg said. "I believe that [yuan
pricing of oil is coming and as soon as the Saudis move to accept it ---
as the Chinese will compel them to do --- then the rest of the oil
market will move along with them]{.underline}." Crux of the petrodollar
In recent years, several nations opposed to the dollar being the world's
reserve currency have progressively sought to try and abandon it. For
instance, [**Russia and China have sought to operate in a non-dollar
environment** when trading oil. Both countries have also increased their
efforts to mine and acquire physical gold if, or perhaps when, the
dollar collapses]{.underline}. OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia is at the crux
of the petrodollar. Since a 1974 agreement between U.S. President
Richard Nixon and Saudi King Faisal, Saudi Arabia has accepted payments
for nearly all of its oil exports in dollars. [However, as China imports
more and more oil from countries across the world, the idea of having to
purchase that same oil in dollars has become increasingly irritable to
Beijing. In recent years, **China has sought to ratchet up the pressure
on Saudi Arabia over the form of currency in which their oil trade is
conducted**, with Riyadh now enjoying less and less oil purchases from
Beijing.]{.underline} What does it mean for the dollar? When asked what
it could mean for the dollar should the oil market move oil trade out of
the U.S. currency and into the yuan, Weinberg said [the world's
transaction currency would suffer "lesser demand for U.S. securities
across the board."]{.underline} "[Moving oil trade out of dollars into
yuan]{.underline} will take right now between \$600 billion and \$800
billion worth of transactions out of the dollar... (That) [means a
stronger demand for things in China, whether it's securities or whether
it's goods and services. **It is a growth plus for China and that's why
they want this to happen."**]{.underline}

#### A petroyuan won't kill dollar heg.

[Few geoeconomic game-changers are more spectacular than
yuan-denominated future crude oil contracts]{.underline} -- especially
when set up by the largest importer of crude on the planet. And [yet
Beijing's media strategy seems to have consisted in substantially play
down the official launch of the petro-yuan]{.underline} at the Shanghai
International Energy Exchange. Still, some euphoria was in order. Brent
Crude soared to \$71 a barrel for the first time since 2015. West Texas
Intermediate (WTI) reached the highest level in three years at \$66.55 a
barrel; then retreated to \$65.53. [A series of petro-yuan "firsts"
include the first time overseas investors are able to access a Chinese
commodity market. **Significantly, US dollars will be accepted as
deposit and for settlement**]{.underline}. In the near future, a basket
of currencies will also be accepted as deposit. [Does the launch of the
petro-yuan represent the ultimate deathblow to the petrodollar -- and
the birth of a completely new set of rules? **Not so fast. That may take
years**, **and** **depends on many variables**, the most important of
which will be China's capacity]{.underline} to bend, tweak and
ultimately rule the global oil market. As the yuan progressively reaches
full consolidation in trade settlement, the petro-yuan threat to the US
dollar, inscribed in a complex, long-term process, will disseminate the
Holy Grail: crude oil futures contracts priced in yuan fully convertible
into gold. That means China's vast array of trade partners will be able
to convert yuan into gold without having to keep funds in Chinese assets
or turn them into US dollars. [Exporters facing the wrath of Washington,
such as Russia, Iran or Venezuela, may then avoid US sanctions by
trading oil in yuan convertible to gold]{.underline}. Iran and
Venezuela, for instance, would have no problems redirecting tankers to
China in order to sell directly in the Chinese market -- if that's what
it takes. How to bypass the US dollar In the short- to medium-term the
petro-yuan will surely boost the appeal of the Belt and Road Initiative
(BRI), especially when it comes to the House of Saud. [It's]{.underline}
still [unclear in what capacity Beijing will be part of the Aramco IPO,
but that will be a decisive step towards the fateful historic moment
when Beijing will tell]{.underline} -- or compel -- [Riyadh to start
accepting payment for oil in yuan]{.underline}. [**Only then the
petrodollar may be at serious risk** -- along with the US dollar as the
global reserve currency]{.underline}. I have stressed before how, at the
2017 BRICS summit, Russian President Vladimir Putin went no holds barred
supporting the petro-yuan, specifically challenging the "unfairness" of
the US dollar's unipolar dominance. How to bypass the US dollar, as well
as the petrodollar, has been discussed at BRICS summits for years now.
Russia is now China's largest crude oil supplier (1.32 million barrels a
day last month, up 17.8% from a year earlier.) [Moscow and Beijing have
been forcefully bypassing the US dollar in bilateral trade]{.underline}.
In October last year, China launched a payment system in both currencies
-- the yuan and the ruble. And that will apply to Russian oil bought by
China. [**Still, the whole petrodollar edifice lies on OPEC** -- and the
House of Saud-- pricing oil in US dollars; as everyone needs greenbacks
to buy oil, everyone needs to buy (spiraling) US debt]{.underline}.
Beijing is set to break the system -- as long as it takes. [The
petro-yuan as it stands does not provide access to Chinese oil
markets]{.underline}. It starts as a great deal especially for Chinese
companies who need to buy oil but would rather avoid the oscillations of
foreign exchange. [**Nothing changes for the rest of the US
dollar-dominated commodity planet** -- at least for now.]{.underline}
The game will really start to change when other nations realize they
have found a real credible alternative to the petrodollar, and switching
to the yuan en masse will certainly spark a US dollar crisis. What the
petro-yuan may be able to provoke in the short term is an acceleration
of the next crises in treasuries and bond markets, which will inevitably
spill out in the form of a crisis in global currency markets. That
pan-Eurasian resource basket The game-changing aspect, for now, mostly
has to do with the exquisite timing. [Beijing has crafted an
**ultra-long-term plan** and yet chose to launch the petro-yuan smack in
the middle of a period of sharp deterioration in trade relations with
Washington]{.underline}. The answer to the geoeconomic riddle is bound
to be The Golden Moment. Eventually gold will rise to a level where
Beijing -- by then totally in control over physical gold markets --
feels ready to set a conversion rate. The -- Arabian -- 'petro' side of
the petrodollar equation should have been replaced long ago by a
priceless, captured pan-Eurasian resource basket. That was what Dick
Cheney dreamed of -- centering his dreams on the energy wealth of
Central Asia and Russia. That did not happen. What we have instead is
shrieking, manic Russophobia -- more like a graphic indication of how
precarious is the position of Western banking elites. On top of it, with
the petro-yuan, China deploys the key weapon, incorporated into BRI,
capable of accelerating the end of the unipolar moment. Yet [this is
just the initial step in an ultra-high-stakes game. One should
keep]{.underline} one's eyes [firmly focused on the interpolations
between trade connectivity and technological breakthroughs. **The
petrodollar may be in danger but is far from finished**.]{.underline}

\*AZRF = Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation

[In contrast with the]{.underline} internationally [**widespread
stereotype** of Russia as a revisionist power in the Arctic, Moscow\'s
future actions]{.underline} in the region [are]{.underline} more [likely
to be]{.underline} fairly **[pragmatic in nature]{.underline}**. Is
Russia igniting a new arms race in the Far North or taking justifiable
steps to defend its interests in a changing environment? The answer to
that question depends greatly on whom you ask, where they are, and just
how much they appreciate the range of issues that factor into Russia\'s
Arctic policy. [In the West, some analysts believe]{.underline} that
[Russia, due to **economic weakness** and **technological
backwardness**, tends to privilege coercive military
instruments]{.underline} to protect its interests in the Far North.
[Western mass media and]{.underline}, to a lesser extent, [politicians
portray]{.underline} the **[modernization]{.underline}** programs [and
changes in]{.underline} Russia\'s **[military
capabilities]{.underline}** within its Arctic territories
[as]{.underline} a [possibly **game-changing**]{.underline} buildup that
increases the risk of conflict. They often trace the start of their
concerns to 2007, when Moscow resumed naval and air patrols in the
Arctic and North Atlantic regions and planted a flag under the North
Pole, staking a major land claim. The Ukraine crisis has only fed
Western skepticism of Russia\'s true aims. Moscow insists that its
intentions, as articulated in the Arctic doctrines of 2008 and 2013, are
inward-focused or purely defensive, and aimed principally at the
protection of the country\'s legitimate interests. Primary among those
interests, it says, is the development of the Arctic Zone of the Russian
Federation (AZRF), already a vital region for the national economy and
one with great promise for further development in energy, mining,
infrastructure, communications, and beyond. [The Kremlin]{.underline}
also [maintains]{.underline} that [it is not pursuing a revisionist
policy, but]{.underline} rather [wishes to **resolve all
disputes**]{.underline} in the Arctic [by **peaceful means**, relying on
**international law** and **organizations**]{.underline}. Military
strategists generally insist that the country must be prepared for
contemporary and emerging security issues, no aggression implied.
Certain [Russian actions and activities]{.underline} in the Arctic [do
support officials\' stated determination to stick to a soft-power
approach, in a context of **dialogue and diplomacy**]{.underline}. At
the same time, the cold, hard facts of increasing military assets in the
Russian Arctic suggest that the government is making sure it is well
prepared to flex its northern muscle. [When the balance sheet is
tallied, there are grounds to believe]{.underline} that [Moscow will
pursue]{.underline} fairly [pragmatic and responsible
policies]{.underline} in the region for the foreseeable future.
Russia\'s Arctic Economy Between the collapse of the Soviet Union and
the early 2000s, the Kremlin paid little attention to the North. The end
of the Cold War meant that the region was no longer a zone of possible
confrontation with NATO and the U.S. In the Yeltsin era, the economic
potential of the region was underestimated, and Russia\'s northern
reaches were perceived by the federal government as aburdensome source
of socio-economic problems. Almost abandoned by Moscow, these areas had
to rely on themselves (or foreign assistance) for survival. Things began
to slowly change when the general socio-economic situation in Russia
improved, and the Putin government, with its ambitious agenda of
national revival, came to power. Today, [Russia has enormous national
interests in the Arctic]{.underline} region. [The industrial
base]{.underline} in the AZRF currently [accounts for]{.underline} up to
**[20 percent of the entire Russian GDP]{.underline}** - even if only
about 1.6 percent of the country\'s population lives there - [and nearly
a quarter of Russia\'s export revenues]{.underline}. Fueling these
figures is the fact that [the region produces]{.underline} no less than
[95 percent of the country\'s gas and]{.underline} approximately [70
percent of its oil]{.underline}. Russian geologists have discovered some
200 oil and gas deposits and there are more than 20 large shelf deposits
in the Barents and Kara Seas which are expected to be developed when
prices rise. The AZRF\'s mining industries yield 99 percent of Russia\'s
diamonds, 98 percent of its platinum, and the majority of other rare
metals. Reduced ice coverage due to global warming will mean increasing
access to these natural resources and correspondingly increasing
significance for the AZRF. The Russian federal and regional governments,
along with the private sector, have articulated plans to further develop
the industries and infrastructure of the region, including hundreds of
billions of dollars in Russian and foreign direct investment in energy,
mining, transport, and communications. Moreover, as the Arctic\'s sea
ice coverage continues to drop, [Russia stands to earn **considerable
economic benefits** from the development of the Northern Sea
Route]{.underline} (NSR) - which, when navigable, is the shortest
shipping route between European and East Asian ports. Important
[domestic routes connecting]{.underline} the full length of [the
country\'s enormous northern border should also expand]{.underline}.
Moscow believes that by improving NSR infrastructure and safety, the NSR
will be attractive not only to Russian business, but also to foreign
shipping companies. When the eagerly anticipated Yamal liquefied natural
gas plant becomes operational next year, shipments to East Asian
markets, and potentially to Europe and North America, will be
facilitated. In a sign of more to come, the new Christophe de Margerie
gas tanker made it through the NSR in August 2017, becoming the first
ship of this type to do so without needing an icebreaker escort. [With
this vast commercial potential as a backdrop, Russian Defense
Minister]{.underline} Sergei [Shoigu announced]{.underline} that [two
new Arctic coast defense divisions]{.underline} are to be established by
2018 as part of an effort to strengthen security along the NSR. One is
likely to be stationed on the Kola Peninsula, in addition to existing
military units there, while the other will be in the eastern Arctic. The
new forces can cover anti-assault, anti-sabotage, and
anti-aircraftdefensive needs. Given the trend of increasing Arctic
access, the government has also made strengthening the Border Guard
Service a top priority for High North security. The Border Guard has
been assigned to deal with new softsecurity threats and challenges, such
as the establishment of reliable border-control systems, the
introduction of special visa regulations to certain regions, and the
implementation of technological controls over fluvial zones and sites
along theNSR. All in all, Moscow plans to build 20 border guard stations
along its Arctic Ocean coastline. On these fronts, the [deployment of
new assets and]{.underline} the [expansion of security mandates in the
Russian Arctic appear]{.underline} to be [**reasonable** and **practical
steps** to support Russia\'s plans]{.underline} for developing the
region. Another change is the ongoing reorganization of the Russian
Coast Guard, a part of the Border Guard Service, which now has awide
remit in the Arctic; in addition to the traditional protection of
biological resources in the Arctic Ocean, oil and gas installations and
shipping along the NSR are among the agency\'s new priorities. The
attention that Russia is now paying to theCoast Guard is in line with
what other coastal states do, especially Norway and Denmark. Moreover,
[Russia actively partook in the creation of an Arctic Coast Guard
Forum]{.underline}, which was [established by]{.underline} the [coastal
states]{.underline} in November 2015. On these fronts, the deployment of
new assets and the expansion of security mandates in the Russian Arctic
appear to be reasonable and practical steps to support Russia\'s plans
for developing the region. Underwater Outpost Beyond guarding the AZRF
and facilitating its development, [a central priority of the
Kremlin\'s]{.underline} regional [strategy is to cement its claim to a
vast expanse of Arctic Ocean territory]{.underline}. In its initial
claim in 2001, Russia argued that the Lomonosov Ridge and the
Alpha-Mendeleev Ridge are both geological extensions of its continental
Siberian shelf and, as such, that much of the central Arctic Ocean falls
under its jurisdiction. The UN Commission on the Limits of the
Continental Shelf (CLCS) found the substantiation of the claim to be
insufficient and requested more information. In 2007, Moscow chose a
highly public way to show that it was undeterred: two mini submarines
completed a record-breaking descent of more than two and a half miles
beneath the North Pole and planted atitanium Russian flag in the seabed.
The move was not received warmly in the West. [Despite lingering
characterizations]{.underline} by some [of]{.underline} the
[flag-planting]{.underline} incident [as a]{.underline}n attempted
[land-grab, the Kremlin]{.underline} has [insisted]{.underline} that [it
plans to solve the problem within the **framework of international
law**]{.underline}, peacefully and based on solid data. [Russia
resubmitted its application in]{.underline} August [2015, and the CLCS
started its review]{.underline} the following year. The new claim
included underwater territories with a total area of almost twice the
size of Texas. The area holds an estimated 4.9 billion metric tons of
standard fuel. Parts of the Russian claim overlap with Danish and
Canadian claims, and the result of the review process remains to be
seen. In principle, [the \"**cooperative/compromise
scenario**,\"]{.underline} which was discussed between Canada, Denmark,
and Russia prior to the Ukraine crisis, [is still one of the possible
outcomes]{.underline}. The CLCS could encourage the three contenders to
negotiate an agreement which could include the idea of making the
central Arctic a zone of international cooperation and/or a natural
reserve governed by the UN. Ukraine in the Arctic? Today, many [western
concerns about Russia\'s Arctic intentions make direct reference to the
Ukraine crisis]{.underline}, or rather, how the West views Russia\'s
actions and intentions in Ukraine. [The crisis]{.underline}, however,
[had **little impact** on Moscow\'s perception of the Arctic as a region
of **international cooperation** and **peace**]{.underline}. As before,
Russia\'s military strategy has three major goals: first, to demonstrate
sovereignty over the AZRF, including its offshore exclusive economic
zone and continental shelf; second, to protect its economic interests in
the High North; and third, to demonstrate that Russia retains its great
power status and has world-class military capabilities. [It should be
noted that following the Soviet era, the Russian military presence in
the Arctic had degenerated significantly, and the country\'s nuclear and
conventional forces]{.underline} badly [needed
modernization]{.underline}. In this sense, [Russia\'s strategy is
comparable with]{.underline} those of [other coastal
states]{.underline}; [the U.S. and Canada]{.underline}, for example,
[are modernizing their assets in the Arctic as well]{.underline}. The
modernization program for Russia\'s strategic forces in the North
includes the renewal of its nuclear submarine fleet. This program was
planned ten years ago, and it was neither initiated nor affected by the
Ukraine crisis. Currently, six Delta IV- and one Typhoon-class
submarines are being updated. Future plans would replace these
watercrafts with the new Borey-class, fourth-generation,
nuclear-powered, ballistic missile submarines. In contrast with the
strategic component, the composition of Russia\'s conventional forces in
the Arctic was affected by Ukraine. At the same time, some Russian
security brass do believe there are threats and challenges that require
further development of military capacity in the Far North. They took
notice of the negative effect of the Ukraine crisis on Russia\'s
relations with NATO and its member states, which unilaterally suspended
several cooperative projects with Russia, including on the development
of theRussian energy sector in the Far North, the development of
confidence- and security-building measures, and
military-to-militarycontacts. As such, in contrast with the strategic
component, the composition of Russia\'s conventional forces in the
Arctic was affected by Ukraine. [Plans had]{.underline} previously [been
announced to transform the **motorized infantry** and **marine
brigades** located in the Murmansk region]{.underline}, near Norway,
[into an Arctic special forces brigade]{.underline}, with soldiers
trained for operations in the Far North. It had also been decided that
all conventional forces in the AZRF should form an Arctic Group of
Forces, to be led by a Joint Strategic Command \"North\" (planned for
2017). However, due to tensions between Russia and the West resulting
from the Ukraine crisis, the Arctic brigade was created ahead of
schedule, in January 2015, and deployed in Alakurtti, close to the
Finnish border. This was done to augment, rather than to replace, the
existing brigades - in contrast with initial plans. It was also
announced that a second Arctic brigade will be formed and stationed east
of the Urals. Given the \"increased NATO military threat\" in the
Arctic, President Putin decided to accelerate thecreation of Command
\"North\" as well. It was established in December 2014, three years
ahead of schedule. [While these developments may sound
alarming]{.underline} to some, [there is only a rather **limited level
of modernization** and increases or changes in force levels and
structures]{.underline}. [Some of these changes]{.underline} - the
creation of new special forces and border guard units, the commissioning
of more sophisticated warships and air defense systems, and the
establishment of new command structures - [have **little** to do with
obtaining **new offensive capabilities** or **power-projection** into
disputed areas or the region at large]{.underline}. Rather, [they are
for the patrolling and protecting of undisputed national territories and
exclusive economic zones]{.underline} that are becoming more accessible,
including for illegal activities, such as poaching, smuggling, and
uncontrolled migration. Other changes - such as the modernization of the
Russian strategic nuclear submarine fleet - may have more to do with
maintaining a deterrent potential against NATO or the U.S. rather than
with developing first-strike potential and other offensive capabilities.
To put it differently, [these modernization programs should not provoke
an arms race or undermine regional cooperation]{.underline}. More than
Military Moscow must also tackle the serious social and economic
problems of the country\'s indigenous Arctic communities, including the
in-compatibility of their traditional ways of life with present economic
realities; rising disease rates; high infant mortality; and alcoholism.
Unemployment among Russia\'s indigenous peoples has been estimated at
between 30 and 60 percent, three to four times higher than that of other
AZRF residents. Life expectancy is 49 years, compared to 72 for the
average Russian. Moscow\'s efforts to remedy these ills have still not
come close to its targets and are harshly criticized by indigenous
peoples and both national and international human rights organizations.
The quality of life for the indigenous population in regions such as
Khanty-Mansi, Nenets, Koryakia, and Chukotka remains unacceptably low.
The Yamalo-Nenets are a, perhaps exceptionally, has a booming indigenous
economy built around reindeer-herding, with social programs implemented
effectively and major conflicts between indigenous interests and energy
companies generally avoided. [The Kremlin does]{.underline} appear to
[understand the need for **constructive dialogue** and **deeper
engagement** with all of Russia\'s AZRF regions, municipalities,
indigenous peoples, and NGOs]{.underline}. In practice, however, the
federal bureaucracy\'s policies and approaches will often confront
subnational actors and civil society. Instead of using the resources of
these actors in a creative way, Moscow tries to control them. In so
doing, the state undermines their initiative, making them passive, both
domestically and internationally. [Russia\'s Arctic policy attempts to
address all]{.underline} of these [factors, from]{.underline} the
[economic to]{.underline} the [territorial, from]{.underline} the
[geopolitical to the social]{.underline}. [In contrast
with the internationally widespread stereotype
of Russia as a **revisionist power**]{.underline} in the Arctic, [its
future actions are]{.underline} more [likely to be fairly
**pragmatic** in nature]{.underline}. This is far from a worst-case
scenario. On the one hand, such an approach will aim to
protect Russia\'s legitimate economic and political
interests in the High North. On the other hand, [Moscow can benefit from
cooperation with foreign
partners]{.underline} in exploiting the Arctic\'s natural resources,
developing its sea routes, and advancing environmental research and
protection. [Russia clearly has a preference for **soft-power** -- or,
more precisely, **non-hard power** -- instruments **in the
Arctic theatre**]{.underline}. That includes a conspicuous disposition
to dialogue and engagement through the relevant international
organizations. This preference should be taken seriously by Russia\'s
partners, as reciprocation will be decisive in determining thefuture
of the Arctic.

Russia\'s [annexation of Crimea and subsequent
war]{.underline} in eastern Ukraine in 2014 [has ignited a fierce
international debate on how to view Russia\'s foreign
policy]{.underline}. Much of [the discussion]{.underline} has f[ocused
on Russia\'s alleged **\'revisionist position\'**
towards the ]{.underline}present [international system]{.underline},
which Russia considers too Western dominated, and Russia\'s supposed
\'assertiveness\' or \'aggressiveness\' (Bartles & McDermott, 2014;
Illarionov, 2014; Kasparov, 2015; Piontkovsky, 2015). [Some scholars
point out that the **annexation of Crimea**]{.underline}
and the war in Ukraine [is a **\'game changer\'**]{.underline}, arguing
that the West must re-assess its threat perception and change its policy
vis-a-vis Russia in a more firm direction (Center for Militære Studier,
2014; House of Commons Defence Committee, 2014). Other scholars argue
that what we are experiencing is a New Cold War
between Russia and the West (Legvold, 2014; Lucas, 2015). Part of this
debate has focused on Russia\'s alleged breaking or bending of
international rules and concepts (Allison, 2014; Kupfer & Waal, 2015;
Lamont, 2014). Others argue that what we see is a \'resumption of
great-power rivalry\' (Trenin, 2014), a \'return of geopolitics\'
(Kotkin, 2016; Mead, 2014; Mearsheimer, 2014). [The debate is further
influenced by the **war in Syria**, where Russia is described as
establishing itself as **\'a player\'** in the Syrian
crisis]{.underline} or as a \'key regional player\' (Kozhanov,
2015) [in the wider Middle East]{.underline}. A move from Putin that
once again has caught Washington \'off-guard\' and essentially
forces the USA and the West \'to get real\' about Russia and forego any
plans of another \'reset\' (Stent, 2016). Another general
argument in the debate has been to highlight a supposed trend
towards a narrowing of the circle of people around Putin to mere
yes-men, ridding him of critical advice (Galeotti & Judah, 2014; Judah,
2014). Other scholars highlight that \'the chaotic manner in which the
operation in Crimea unfolded belies any concerted plan for territorial
revanche\' as a sign of \'a leader who is increasingly prone to risky
gambles and to grabbing short-run tactical advantages\' (Treisman, 2016,
p. 48), and who \'is about immediate tactics, not long-term strategy\'
(Marten, 2015, p. 191). [The impression]{.underline} left [from these
most valid accounts is a Russia that must be **confronted** and
**balanced** because of its assertive, aggressive and revisionist
stand]{.underline}. A country which one cannot cooperate with but must
balance because of its rule-changing and destabilising behaviour. And a
Russian leader who is short sighted, unpredictable and gambling with the
future of his country, who takes all of the important decisions on
foreign policy on his own without consulting more than a handful of
trusted advisors and friends. But [if one takes a closer look at
**Russia\'s policy vis-a-vis the Arctic**, Russia does not look like a
**revisionist power**]{.underline}. [It looks]{.underline} more
[like a **status quo power** following a **well-established** long-term
strategy]{.underline}. Paradoxically, [Russia has followed the **\'rules
of the game\'** in the Arctic]{.underline} - while all the time
\'breaking the rules of the game\' in Ukraine. [Russia has been a
**constructive supporter** of the Arctic Council and the Barents
Euro-Arctic Council, and]{.underline} it has [strictly followed the
process of delineation of the undersea territory in the Arctic under
the]{.underline} auspices of the [United Nations Convention of the Law
of the Sea]{.underline} (UNCLOS) - of which it (the Soviet Union) has
been a signatory member since 1982 - and met deadlines and requirements
of the UN Committee on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS). It
has not bullied or threatened its neighbours and fellow members of the
Arctic Council. [How can this be explained if Russia\'s behaviour is
increasingly confrontational, rule breaking and assertive?]{.underline}
Is it just a matter of time - a period of \'quite before the storm\' -
until Russia is strong enough to use its steady growing military power
in the Arctic for breaking rules and making territorial gains in that
area as well? Or is Russia actually engaging in a rule-governed
behaviour that is non-assertive and non-revisionist, at least in the
Arctic? And what implications, if any, might this have on other policy
areas? Are there other areas where we might cooperate rather than
confront Russia? [In explaining]{.underline} the [**lack of spillover**
from the war in Ukraine]{.underline} so far some [scholars underline the
effects of **international organisations** and **regimes** in the
Arctic]{.underline} (Ikonen, 2015). Some are more sceptical of what the
future brings and suggests establishing new, or enhanced, institutions
in the Arctic, especially concerning security issues (Conley & Rohloff,
2015). Others focus on structural factors and point to [the lack of
**conflicting national interests** between the Arctic coastal
states]{.underline} in [explain]{.underline}ing [the apparent lack of
spillover from the war in Ukraine and point to the mutual coexistence of
\'moderate military build-up combined with enhanced diplomatic
accommodation\' in the Arctic]{.underline} (Kristensen & Sakstrup,
2016).

[Contrary to]{.underline} the [**Western alarmists**\' worries about
Moscow\'s military pre-eminence in the Arctic, the Russian military
presence]{.underline} in the region [has **considerably decreased** over
the last two decades]{.underline}. [Both components -- naval and air
force -- of the Russian armed forces in the region are **inferior** to
the NATO ones]{.underline} (see Tables 1 and 2). It should be also noted
that [in contrast with the Cold War period when Russian military
strategies in the Arctic were dictated by the logic of **global
political** and **military confrontation** between two
superpowers]{.underline} (USSR and USA) or two military blocs (Warsaw
Pact and NATO), [the current Moscow' military policies in the region are
driven by completely different motives]{.underline}. As [the threat of a
global nuclear war has disappeared]{.underline}, these strategies aim at
three major goals: first, to demonstrate and ascertain Russia\'s
sovereignty over the AZRF (including the EEZ and continental shelf);
second, to protect its economic interests in the High North; and third,
to demonstrate that Russia retains its great power status and has
world-class military capabilities. The demonstration of Russia' military
power and its regional presence in the Arctic are mainly done through
strategic bomber and naval patrols as well as land and naval exercises.
The air force is perceived by Moscow as a central element in its
demonstration of power. Overflights of Russian military aircraft over
the Arctic fell from 500 per year during the Soviet period to only half
a dozen in the 1990s and at the start of the 2000s. In 2007, Russian
strategic bombers flew over the Arctic for the first time since the end
of the Cold War. Two Tu-95MS, based in the Saratov region at the Engels
aviation base with mid-flight refueling capability, now regularly patrol
the Arctic. These overflights drew heavy criticism from Norway, Canada,
UK and the USA who have seen these patrols as evidence of Russia\'s
return to the Soviet-like military practices and growing strategic
ambitions in the Arctic. However, as the most authoritative [Western
military experts point]{.underline} it [out, the resumption of the
Arctic]{.underline} strategic bomber [patrols may be
interpreted]{.underline} more in terms of the desire not to lose
capacities and, above all, [as a **political tool** rather than the sign
of a **renewed aggressiveness**]{.underline} in the
region.[22](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.library.emory.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14751798.2014.948276)22.
Lasserre, Le Roy, and Garon, 'Is There an Arms Race in the Arctic?';
Laruelle, Russia\'s Arctic Strategies, 128--9.View all notes As far as
the air force potential available for operations in the Arctic is
concerned, Russia has a fleet of aging long- and medium-range bombers.
There are 63 turbo-propelled Tu-95MSs, which are very old (designed in
the 1950s) but still the mainstays of the Russian strategic aviation.
The Russian air force also has 18 more modern, long-range Tu-160
Blackjacks bombers, as well as 80 Tu-22M Backfire medium bombers that
were especially feared by NATO in the Cold War period for their
anti-ship capacities. It should be noted that these planes are not
stealthy and are easily detected when flying at high altitude, despite
additional electronic countermeasures recently added to the Tu-160 and
Tu-22M. Moreover, the shortage of mid-air refueling tankers remains the
most serious problem affecting the operational capabilities of Russian
strategic aviation. Several Arctic air bases have been reactivated in
Anadyr, Monchegorsk, Olenia, Tiksi, Vorkuta and -- more recently -- on
the Kotelny Island (Novosibirsky Archipelago) although with quite
limited and dual-use (military and civilian)
capacities.[23](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.library.emory.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14751798.2014.948276)23.

The prototype is scheduled to fly in 2020 and the aircraft is expected
to enter service only in 2025--2030. However, these plans can be changed
if other programs (for example, the 5th generation fighter Sukhoi
T-50/PAK-FA) would become a more important priority for the Russian Air
Force. Because of the long time frame for the development of the PAK-DA,
it was decided to upgrade the Tu-22M and produce 10 more Tu-160s before
2020. Some experts suggest that probably many present Russian strategic
and medium-range bombers will no longer be operational by 2025--2030 and
the air force will then be left only with its aging Tu-160 and Tu-95
fleet. As far as the [naval patrolling]{.underline} is concerned, since
2007, Russia resumed long-range patrols in different parts of the world.
This [was symbolized by]{.underline} the [patrols undertaken by the
nuclear-powered]{.underline} guided-missile [cruiser Peter the
Great]{.underline} through the Mediterranean and Caribbean Seas, and the
South Atlantic and Indian Oceans. In 2008, Russia confirmed that it was
expanding its current level of operations in the Arctic. The Navy
resumed its warship presence in the Arctic Ocean with military ships
patrolling near Norwegian and Danish defense zones. It also increased
the operational radius of the Northern Fleet\'s submarines, and
under-ice training for submariners has become a priority task. [Russia
has **ambitious plans** to modernize its navy]{.underline} deployed to
the High North. For example, after the Peter the Great\'s successful
trip around the world in 2007, the Ministry of Defense announced that it
would upgrade three other heavy nuclear-powered missile cruisers, the
Admiral Lazarev, the Admiral Nakhimov and the Admiral Ushakov.
Currently, the Admiral Kuznetsov, the only Russia aircraft carrier,
operates with the Northern Fleet, hosting 20 fighters and 10
anti-submarine helicopters on board. The destroyer Vice-Admiral Kulakov,
recently repaired, was integrated into the Northern Fleet in 2011. The
naval aviation includes 200 combat aircrafts and 50 helicopters. Looking
at the problems that the Northern Fleet currently faces, it should be
noted that the fleet needs coastal ships and frigates able to conduct
rapid intervention operations. Several are currently under construction,
but they have already experienced numerous delays. The purchase of two
Mistrals helicopter carriers from France and the project to build eight
Admiral Gorshkov class and six Krivak class frigates which is constantly
delayed will not be enough to renew Russia\'s ocean-going surface ships.
Keeping nuclear deterrence capabilities is crucial for the future of the
Northern Fleet. The older sea-based nuclear deterrent is in the process
of deep modernization. Presently, Russia has six operational Delta III
and six Delta IV strategic submarines. According to the Russian Defense
Ministry, there are no plans to modernize the older Delta III class
submarines. They were built during the 1980s and will be decommissioned
in the near future. Only the Delta IV submarines undergo the process of
modernization. They will be provided with a new sonar system and the new
Inter Continental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Sineva (Skiff SSN-23) which
entered service in 2007. Sineva is a third-generation liquid-propelled
ICBM, which is able to cover a distance up to 8300 kilometers and to
carry either 4 or 10 nuclear
warheads.[24](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.library.emory.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14751798.2014.948276)24.

Soviet Union -- has been in operation by the Northern Fleet since
January 2013. Two other Borey-class submarines, the Alexander Nevsky and
the Vladimir Monomakh, run the sea trials and the fourth one, Prince
Vladimir, is under construction at the Severodvinsk

Pacific Fleet. The Borey-class submarines, which are to be deployed to
the Northern Fleet will be based at the Gadzhievo navy base (about
100 km from the Norwegian border), where new infrastructure is being
built to host them. This new generation of the Russian strategic
submarines is almost invisible at deep ocean depths and -- having
several types of cruise missiles and torpedoes -- it will be able to
carry out multipurpose missions, including attacks on enemy aircraft
carriers and missile strikes on coastal targets. According to the
Defense Ministry\'s plans, the building of eight Borey-class submarines
(four for the Northern Fleet and four for the Pacific one) should be
completed by 2020, which once again seems too ambitious and unlikely. To
provide the logistical and administrative support to the Northern Fleet,
a new Arctic Center for Material and Technical Support with a staff of
more than 15,000 was created in 2012. As far as the land forces are
concerned the 200th independent motorized infantry brigade, with
soldiers trained in a special program and equipped with modern personal
equipment for military operations in Arctic, will be based at Pechenga
close to the Norwegian border town of Kirkenes and be operational by
2016. It should be noted that these plans will not increase Russia\'s
offensive capabilities because the above-mentioned unit will replace the
two brigades (the marine and army ones) that are currently located near
Pechenga. Along with the army, air force and navy, the efforts to
strengthen the Border Guards Service\'s (which is subordinated to the
FSS) control over the region were made. An Arctic border guards unit was
created as early as in 1994. Its aim was to monitor the circulation of
ships and poaching at sea. The unit was reorganized in 2004--2005. In
2009, it was announced that new Arctic units had been established in
border guard stations in Arkhangelsk and Murmansk. They started to
patrol the NSR -- for the first time since the Soviet time. Now the
border guards are assigned with the task to deal with the new -- soft
security -- threats and challenges, such as the establishment of
reliable border control systems, the introduction of special visa
regulations to certain regions and the implementation of technological
controls over fluvial zones and sites along the NSR. It is currently
controlled from the air by border guard aircrafts and on the land and
sea by the North-Eastern Border Guard Agency; the Russian border guards
further plan to establish a global monitoring network from Murmansk to
Wrangel Island. All in all, Moscow plans to build 20 border guard
stations along the Arctic Ocean\'s
coastline.[28](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.library.emory.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14751798.2014.948276)28.

the academia but also the military. The objective of the Russian Navy\'s
mission within the framework of the expedition Arktika-2012 was to prove
that its landmass extends to the North Pole by drilling into the sea
floor to collect rock samples for scientific analysis. In September
2012, the Kalitka, a Losharik-class nuclear-powered auxiliary submarine,
was used to guide the Kapitan Dranitsyn and Dickson icebreakers in
drilling three boreholes at two different sites on the Mendeleev ridge,
collecting over 500 kg of rock
samples.[29](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.library.emory.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14751798.2014.948276)29.

Mir stations used in the Arktika-2007 expedition can also operate at
such depths, they can only stay submerged for 72 hours. The Kalitka was
mounted to the underside of a larger nuclear-powered auxiliary submarine
(the Orenburg, a redesigned Kalmar or Delta III stretch) to transport it
to the drilling site and was supported by the larger boat during the
operation. To sum up, [the Russian modernization programs do **not

the Arctic, [including efforts to build **new ports** and]{.underline}
other [**infrastructure facilities** and expand an **icebreaker
fleet**]{.underline}. Speaking at the Arctic forum in St. Petersburg
attended by leaders of Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, Mr. [Putin
said]{.underline} that [Russia plans to dramatically increase cargo
shipments across the Arctic sea route]{.underline}. He said that the
amount of cargo carried across the shipping lane is set to increase from
20 million metric tons last year to 80 million tons in 2025. \"This is a
realistic, well-calculated and concrete task,\" Mr. Putin said. He noted
that [Russia, the only nation with a **nuclear icebreaker fleet**, is
moving to expand it]{.underline}. Russia currently has four nuclear
icebreakers, and Mr. [Putin said]{.underline} that [three
new]{.underline} such [ships are currently under
construction]{.underline}. By 2035, Russia stands to have a fleet of 13
heavy icebreakers, including nine nuclear-powered ones, he said. The
Russian leader said that [Russia plans to **expand**]{.underline} the
[**ports** on both sides]{.underline} of the Arctic shipping route --
Murmansk on the Kola Peninsula and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky on the
Kamchatka Peninsula -- [and invited foreign companies to invest in the
reconstruction project]{.underline}. Other ports and infrastructure
facilities along the route will also be upgraded and expanded, he said.
[Russia]{.underline}, the [United States, Canada, Denmark, and Norway
have]{.underline} all [been trying to assert jurisdiction over parts of
the Arctic as shrinking polar ice creates new opportunities for
**resource exploration** and **new shipping lanes**]{.underline}.
Speaking at the forum, Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg emphasized
the need to respect international law and noted that the Arctic Council
provides a key arena for dialogue. \"Now and then I hear the Arctic
described as a geopolitical hotspot,\" she said. \"This is not how we
see it. We know the Arctic as a region of peace and stability.\" She
noted that \"this should not be taken for granted,\" adding that \"it is
the result of political decisions and practical cooperation between the
Arctic states.\" \"Respect for international law and regional
cooperation are keys to ensuring peace and stability across borders,\"
Ms. Solberg said. Ms. Solberg and other leaders who spoke at the forum
underlined the need for all countries in the Arctic region to focus on
areas of mutual interest despite differences. [The Russian
military]{.underline} has [revamped and modernized a]{.underline} string
of Soviet-era [**military bases** across the polar region, looking to
protect its hold]{.underline} on the region, which is believed to hold
up to one-quarter of the Earth\'s undiscovered oil and gas. Addressing
the forum, [Russian Foreign Minister]{.underline} Sergey [Lavrov
said]{.underline} that **[military deployments]{.underline}** in the
Arctic [are intended to **protect national interests**]{.underline}.
\"We ensure the necessary defense capability in view of the
military-political situation near our borders,\" Mr. Lavrov said, noting
that a recent NATO exercise in Norway was openly directed against
Russia. [Russia\'s relations with the U.S. and]{.underline} other [NATO
allies]{.underline} have [plummeted to post-Cold War lows over the
Ukrainian crisis,]{.underline} the [war in Syria, Moscow\'s meddling in
the 2016]{.underline} U.S. presidential [election, and other
issues.]{.underline} Mr. Putin used the forum to criticize the U.S. and
the EU sanctions against Russia over its action in Ukraine, but
emphasized that they wouldn\'t hamper the country\'s plans to expand its
presence in the Arctic. He charged that the U.S. has used the economic
restrictions as a tool to protect its economic interests, citing
Washington\'s opposition to a prospective pipeline under the Baltic Sea
that would carry Russian gas to Germany as an example.

share of skepticism, centered around cost and practicality concerns. It
now appears that Russia's Northern Fleet plans to give at least one of
its Typhoon submarines a new lease on life, though not quite in the way
that Burtsev intended. Dmitri Donskoi, the first Typhoon-class vessel

RSM-56 Bulava ballistic missile testbed. In 2018, it was announced that
[Donskoi will undergo a **deep refit** to join the upcoming
[Borei](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/russias-new-borei-class-submarine-armed-new-and-deadly-nuclear-missile-and-super-stealth)
line]{.underline} as one of two Russian submarine classes to deploy
Bulava missiles. Earlier this week, the press office of Russia's
Northern Fleet announced that Donskoi has [completed combat
trials](https://dni24.com/exclusive/225941-samaya-bolshaya-v-mire-apl-proshla-morskie-ispytaniya-posle-remonta.html)
in the White Sea. It is unclear if a similar fate awaits Arkhangelsk and
Severstal, which were
[decommissioned](https://sputniknews.com/military/201801191060883176-nuclear-submarines-utilization-russia/)
in the mid 2000's and have sat in a Severodvinsk repair port ever since.
But even if Donskoi will be the only one to receive this treatment,
[serious logistical problems]{.underline} persist. [Not only is there a
**heavy upfront bill** to refitting]{.underline} as old and large a
vessel as Donskoi, [but the **maintenance costs**]{.underline} of a
modernized Typhoon submarine [would far exceed]{.underline} that of
[its]{.underline} much [smaller and leaner Borei
counterparts]{.underline}. What does [the Russian Navy]{.underline}
stand to [gain from such a **daunting and expensive
project**]{.underline}, [involving everything

titanium derusting to nuclear reactor replacement?
**[Prestige]{.underline}**, for one. [Typhoon is]{.underline} arguably
[the most feared and renowned submarine]{.underline} line [ever
constructed by Russia]{.underline} or its Soviet predecessor state; a
household name from such classic films as the Hunt for Red October, but
also [a genuinely **potent**]{.underline}
[[**centerpiece**]{.underline}](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/russias-typhoon-class-submarines-had-enough-nuclear-18374)
[of the **Soviet SLBM arsenal**]{.underline} from 1981 onward. [There
is]{.underline}, however, [a technical case]{.underline} for refitting
at least one Typhoon vessel. [Russia's emerging [modernization
model](http://cimsec.org/ambitions-challenges-russias-naval-modernization-program/30008)]{.underline}
of a lean, local, rapid-response force [may be]{.underline} a

sprawling coastlines [but]{.underline} has [increasingly left
the]{.underline} Russian [Navy without a maritime means of conducting

Burtsev notes that [Russia's current]{.underline} submarine [lineup
compares unflatteringly with]{.underline} the [refitted US]{.underline}
Ohio-class [submarines]{.underline}, capable of fielding a whopping 154
Tomahawk cruise missiles. He adds that even Russia's surface ships, like
the new Admiral Gorshkov class frigates, struggle to match this volume
of firepower; the aging, heavily armed Kirov-class [Petr

The [Soviet Navy would have to "treat and/or derust each Typhoon's
massive steel outer hull]{.underline} and Titanium inner hulls.
[Russia]{.underline} may have [lost the highly expensive industrial
capability to work Titanium for submarines]{.underline}." On April 20,
2019, Russia's TASS Agency [reported](http://tass.com/defense/1049551)
that [Vice Admiral]{.underline} Oleg [Burtsev announced Russia's
intention to take two of its decommissioned Typhoon-class ballistic
submarines and pack them full of hundreds of cruise
missiles]{.underline}. "The dimensions of these submarines allow arming
each of them with at least 200 cruise missiles \[each\]," he said. The
Typhoon ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs), famously
[featured](https://youtu.be/AWPBr4L1eyE?t=99) in the film Hunt for Red
October, are by far the biggest and most expensive submarines ever
built. Cruise-missile-armed Typhoons would give Russia direct analogs of
the United States' four[Ohio-class cruise missile
submarines](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/the-navy-has-one-submarine-could-drop-154-tomahawks-missiles-23529)
(SSGNs), which had their launch tubes for nuclear-armed ballistic
missiles replaced with vertical launch systems for 154
conventionally-armed Tomahawk cruise missiles. Burtsev made the
missile-envy issue explicit: "American Ohio-class submarines can carry
154 Tomahawk cruise missiles and [Chinese Project 055
destroyer](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/could-chinas-new-type-55-destroyer-beat-the-us-navy-battle-23149)
is capable of carrying 112 cruise missiles. But our frigates belonging
to the Project 22350 can currently carry only 16 of them. Subsequent
frigates will get 24 of them. It is still insufficient," he added. But
[there's a big problem]{.underline} this plan---[revamping the two
mothballed subs would likely cost more than]{.underline} simply
[building newer]{.underline}, better [submarines]{.underline} for the
job. The Typhoon and Kalibr The Typhoon-class submarine, officially
designated the Project 941 Akula ("Shark") in Russia, are Cold War
behemoths measuring 175-meters in length and displacing 48,000 ton
submerged. That amounts to twice the tonnage of American [Ohio-class
SSBN](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/why-russia-china-fear-americas-ohio-class-submarines-19120)
it was intended to rival. No less than five internal pressure hulls made
of ultra-expensive titanium gave the Typhoon's extraordinary resilience
to battle damage---and extraordinary cost to manufacture. The Typhoons
were designed to lurk under the ice of the Arctic Circle, covered by
friendly Soviet naval forces, awaiting a very-low-frequency radio signal
indicating that World War III had broken out and had gone nuclear. In
that event, they'd rise close to the surface, counting on their
reinforced sails to smash through the ice if necessary, and launch their
twenty R-39 ballistic missiles. Each missile, in turn, would unleash ten
independently targeted 100-kiloton yield nuclear warheads on American
and European cities and military bases. Only one Typhoon remains
operational today, TK-208 Dimitriy Donskoi, which has been employed on
occasional missile tests. Three others, plus another Typhoon which was
laid down and never completed, were scrapped between 2005 and 2009, an
operation 80 percent funded with U.S. and Canadian money. Smaller, newer
and stealthier Borei­-class SSBNs, as well as older Delta-class boats,
perform Russian nuclear deterrence patrols instead---at half the
operating and maintenance cost of the Typhoons. The two Typhoons being
proposed for refit are the decommissioned TK-17 Arkhangelskand TK-20
Severstal, which have been rusting in an Arctic ship repair center at
Severodvinsk since 2006 and 2004 respectively. For over a decade, the
Russian Navy repeatedly announced intentions to either scrap or refit
the subs as [recently as
2018](https://sputniknews.com/military/201801241061036396-akula-submarines-retirement-plans/),
only to apparently [change its
mind](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/some-russias-most-powerful-warships-including-2-the-worlds-18389).
[The idea of arming]{.underline} the [Typhoons with cruise missiles and
mines]{.underline}, instead of new ballistic missiles, [has been kicked
around]{.underline}
[[for]{.underline}](https://sputniknews.com/russia/20081216118881590/) a
while. The Typhoons have even been considered for use as [submarine
cargo
ships](https://gcaptain.com/russian-cargo-submarine-bizarre-maritime-technology/)
for circumventing Arctic ice. Burtsev stated that [Kalibr­ cruise
missiles would be the Typhoon SSGN's principle armament, but also
suggested]{.underline} more [advanced Zircon and hypersonic Oniks
missile currently under development could also be equipped]{.underline}.
The Kalibr is [Russia's
analog](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/why-russias-enemies-fear-the-kalibr-cruise-missile-19129)
of the U.S. Tomahawk cruise missile. It comes in a submarine-launched
3M14K land-attack and 3M54K radar-guided anti-ship variants, with ranges
of 1,600 and 400 miles respectively. Unlike the subsonic Tomahawk, the
anti-ship 3M54 model can dash nearly three times the speed of sound on
its terminal approach to evade missile defenses. On at least nine
occasions between 2015-2018, Russian Kilo-class submarines have fired
subsonic 3M14K Kalibr missile through their torpedo tubes at land
targets in Syria. The P-800 Oniks is a more advanced supersonic
anti-ship missile in service on new Yasen-class submarines, while Zircon
is a hypersonic weapon with a reported top speed of Mach 9 that has yet
to be integrated onto a submarine platform. Costs Meet Benefits The idea
of a gigantic submarine ripple-firing two hundred cruise missiles at
NATO bases or a carrier task force sounds intimidating. But just how
realistic is a cruise-missile refit? [Submarine analyst Peter
Coates]{.underline} [[notes in a blog
post](http://gentleseas.blogspot.com/2019/03/extraordinary-russian-comments-on.html)
the major challenges revamping the Typhoons would pose]{.underline}. The
Soviet Navy would have to "treat and/or derust each Typhoon's massive
steel outer hull and Titanium inner hulls. [Russia]{.underline} may have
[lost the highly expensive industrial capability to work Titanium for
submarines]{.underline}." [Russia would]{.underline} also [have to
develop modernized combat systems and sensors]{.underline}, particularly
for targeting the cruise missiles, as well as heavily retrofit the
2.4-meter diameter ballistic missile tubes to pack in twenty cruise
missiles each. Then, [there is the matter of the Typhoon's]{.underline}
two thirty-three-year-old [nuclear reactors, which]{.underline} would
likely [need to be replaced entirely]{.underline}. Lastly, [cruise
missiles]{.underline} like the Kalibr, priced at \$1.2 million each,
[are fantastically expensive]{.underline} even for the U.S. military,
and Russia has roughly one-twelfth the defense budget. Concentrating
two-hundred missiles on one submarine, rather than dispersing them
across Russia's many Kalibr-compatible launch platforms, may not be a
sensible or affordable way to use the limited supply of costly missiles.

David **Chandler 07**, Westminster IR professor, "Deconstructing
Sovereignty: Constructing Global Civil Society," in Politics Without
Sovereignty: A Critique of Contemporary International Relations, pg
164-5

Global civil society [[theorists focus]{.mark} their ire [on]{.mark}
what they understand to be the]{.underline} narrow, [exclusionary bias
of [the sovereign state]{.mark}. In turn, they
[view]{.mark}]{.underline} a wide constellation of [[transnational
actors]{.underline}]{.mark}, from the global mega-NGOs to
[local]{.underline} farming [cooperatives, [as]{.mark} representing [a
radical alternative]{.mark} that opens up]{.underline} the [space for
new]{.underline} kinds of [political]{.underline} organization and
[activity. In fact, what the celebration of 'bottom-up' politics and the
critique of the state really express is a deep disenchantment
with]{.underline} mass [society and]{.underline} the demands of [formal
accountability that go along with]{.underline} representative
[democracy]{.underline}.72 [**[A consequence]{.mark} of rejecting the
political sphere [is that it leaves]{.mark} political [struggles
isolated from any shared framework]{.mark} of meaning** or from any
formal processes]{.underline} of democratic accountability. [[The quest
for]{.mark} individual [autonomy]{.mark}]{.underline} and the claim for
the recognition of separate 'political spaces' [and the
'incommunicability' of political causes]{.underline}, each
**[[demonstrate]{.mark} the [limits of]{.mark} these [radical claims

global **[civil [society]{.mark}]{.underline}** \[END PAGE 164\]
[[**'from below'**. Far from reflecting]{.mark} the emergence of
[new]{.mark}]{.underline} global [[political forces]{.mark}, the global
civil society, by virtue of its social [isolation, is marked by]{.mark}
political **[weakness]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As such, [[the only
strategy left]{.mark} to it [is]{.mark} a retreat into]{.underline}
elite lobbying and **[[individualized ethical
postures]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It is important to stress that [I am
not claiming that the key problem with radical]{.underline} global civil
society [approaches is their rejection of formal engagement per se in
existing political institutions]{.underline} and established parties.
[The point I am making]{.underline} here [is that the **rejection of
state-based politics**, which forces the individual to engage with and
account for the views of other members of society, reflects a deeper
problem -- an unwillingness to engage in political
contestation]{.underline} per se. **[[Proponents
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** global civil [**society 'from below' therefore
seek to legitimize their views as the [prior moral claims]{.mark}** of
others. This has the effect of transforming]{.underline} global civic
[actors into]{.underline} the [advocates of those unable to make moral
claims themselves]{.underline}. Alternatively, they put themselves in
harm's way and would lead by inarticulate example. [What they
[avoid]{.mark} doing is]{.underline} pursuing their own interests or
[[seeking to build]{.mark} political [solidarity around shared
interests. What can actually be achieved through their]{.mark} chosen
[methods is **limited**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Radical lobbying and calls
for recognition may in some cases precipitate a generational turnover in
the establishment. [However, the rejection of social engagement is more
likely to [lead to a **further shrinking** of the political]{.mark}
sphere, [reducing it to]{.mark} a small circle of **[increasingly
unaccountable elites]{.mark}**. [If the only alternative]{.mark} to the
political 'game' [is]{.mark} to threaten to 'take our ball home' -- the
anti-politics of [rejectionism -- the powers that be can sleep
peacefully]{.mark} in their beds]{.underline}.

#### The alternative results in a [solipsistic retreat into the self]{.underline} that [recreates]{.underline} the anti-black logics they disavow --- a strategy that [critically leverages]{.underline} the legal system is the [best approach]{.underline}.

Recently, this last option has gained traction in the scholarly
community under the name of Afro-pessimism.3 [[Theorists]{.mark} under
this banner have investigated the persistence, through many shifting
forms, of **antiblack racism**]{.underline} throughout the history of
the West. [They [claim]{.mark} that **[Western metaphysics]{.mark}** or
**theology**]{.underline} [[has rooted]{.mark} **deep within it** [a
commitment to]{.mark} the **[dehumanization of black
bodies]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [The very concept of the human has been
defined in such a way as to exclude blacks.]{.underline} Black life is a
life foreclosed, at every moment present but ignored, counted only to be
condemned. Slavery and segregation were, in this view, symptoms of a
deeper problem, just as the racism of the legal system is a symptom.
[[Within this **totalizing rubric**]{.mark}, the disease of
[anti-blackness is **so intransigent** that there **is no
hope**]{.mark}.4]{.underline} Or, in a theological register, the only
hope is for apocalypse: for a time when all worldly laws will be struck
down, when the law of God will be implemented, and when black bodies
will be resurrected. Although Afro-pessimist theorists may be committed
in principle to resisting racism---given the intense foreclosure of
black humanity, black life itself comes to be coterminous with
resistance---there is neither a sense that practical wisdom is needed to
engage with the social and political world nor a sense that normative
conclusions can be drawn from any form of reflection on human nature.
Practical wisdom buys into the logic of white supremacy when what is
needed is for that logic to be upended. Reflection on human nature is
impossible because the foreclosure of black humanity has been so
thorough. [[We are left **waiting for the
apocalypse**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

3\. Frank **[[Wilderson]{.underline}]{.mark}** synthesizes the tradition
in the first chapter of his Red, White, and Black. In theology, Carter's
Race and Jennings's Christian Imagination can be read in this tradition.

4\. For a thoughtful reflection on hope in Afro-pessimism, **[[see
Warren]{.underline}]{.mark}**, "Black Nihilism and the Politics of
Hope"; see also Lloyd, "Afro-Pessimism and Christian Hope."

[[Afro-pess]{.mark}imism [results in a **solipsistic retreat** into
the]{.mark} **supposedly foreclosed [self]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[White supremacy]{.underline}]{.mark} cuts off or [[**perverts all
possibilities** for **black sociality**]{.mark} on this
theory]{.underline}. It similarly cuts off or perverts all possibilities
for intergenerational transmission.5 [[What is left is the **individual,
black and alone**, facing the]{.mark} **indestructible [behemoth of
white supremacy]{.mark}**. The individual will **try to
resist,**]{.underline} will try to take up David's slingshot. [But with
no criteria by which to know justice, [with]{.mark} his or [her]{.mark}
own [sense of self]{.mark} always [**mangled** by the **crushing force
of white supremacy**]{.mark}, there are **few pebbles to throw** and no
one with whom to consult to learn how to fashion a
slingshot]{.underline}. All that is left is to pray or retreat into
memories---or memoirs.

Jones-Armstrong for thinking through these points with me.

[Must the black natural law tradition really **collapse** when faced
with the **challenge of a racist legal system?** [I see **no reason**
why this **must be so.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Consider again what [[black natural law]{.mark} most centrally
[entails]{.mark}]{.underline}: [[**ideology critique** and **social
movement organizing**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[These]{.underline}]{.mark}
are the responses that [necessarily follow from proper reflection on
human nature and its distortions]{.underline}. Both of [these
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} called for and are [[**very possible
responses** to a **racist legal system**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Upon
seeing a chain gang outside her train window, Anna Julia Cooper responds
by calling for the creation of a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Humans. That is to say, she calls for organizing, and she does it in
a text that performs ideology critique, calling into question the wisdom
of the world. [[The black natural law tradition **embraces the need**
for **robust institutions**]{.mark} in the black community to cultivate
right perception of natural law, and it puts front and center the role
of intergenerational transmission in cultivating such right
perception.]{.underline}

What, then, of the worry that the systemic violence of the American
legal system leaves black natural law flummoxed because it presents no
point of attack, no single law that can be compared unfavorably with
natural law? [Such [**points of attack** could]{.mark} serve **two
purposes**]{.underline}. [On the one hand, they [could **motivate calls
for justice**]{.mark}**.** The canonical formulations of black natural
law]{.underline} do not begin by attacking specific laws, however. They
[begin by reflecting on how human nature is distorted by institutions,
laws, and social norms]{.underline}. [The second purpose that [an
**attack on specific laws**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[might]{.mark} serve
is to offer a way of **[implement]{.mark}**ing natural law.]{.underline}
But the [**[black natural law]{.mark} tradition** emphasizes the need
for **practical wisdom** and **patience** in the **implementation of
natural law**.]{.underline} [The Montgomery bus boycott **initially**
did not demand integration]{.underline}; it demanded first-come,
first-served seating on buses, whites from the front and blacks from the
back. Douglass remained a slave, patiently waiting for the right
opportunity to escape all the while building community with his fellows,
even after triumphing in his fight with Covey and thus confirming his
right to freedom. [**[Specific laws may be attacked]{.mark}**, but
**only** [at the **proper moment.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The challenge of America's **racist legal system** offers an
opportunity to **confirm and refine** the **black natural law
tradition**. Focusing on **one or another law** to be fixed **tempts us
to forget** what is **most basic** in that tradition: **ideology
critique** and **social movement organizing**]{.underline}.
[[**Confronting the racist legal system** teaches blacks to look
**suspiciously** on the]{.mark} **wisdom of the [world,]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} **work together to [build power]{.mark}**[, and to]{.mark}
patie**ntly [wait until the right moment]{.mark}** to **rise up and

### AT: Anti-Ethics 

#### Anti-blackness doesn't corrupt all ethics

Naomi **Zack 17**. University of Oregon. 03/07/2017. Review of Stain
Removal: Ethics and Race. Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews,
https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/stain-removal-ethics-and-race/.

Miller begins by [[claiming]{.mark} that there cannot be]{.underline} an
[ethics of race because]{.underline} an [ethics of
**anything**]{.underline} [presupposes that its **subject**]{.underline}
[can be **perceived**]{.underline} or correctly described [in
some]{.underline} \"factual\" or [value-neutral way]{.underline},
because it is \"outside\" of ethics. [But race is]{.underline}
**[already evaluative]{.underline}** (evaluated) [throughout the modern
period]{.underline}, beginning systematically in philosophy with Kant\'s
ordinal (ranked, with whites first) taxonomy of human races. Miller\'s
insistence that race is already inexorably evaluative is based on his
emphasis of the importance of myths about the transfer of value through
heredity and physical embodiment. Physical embodiment is the object of
perception, so that racial identities are what Bernard Williams has
called \"prejudicial objects.\" Miller claims that [value-laden myths
about race have **criminalized some** human bodies]{.underline} in a
tradition of \"blessing and curses.\" [By contrast, and in
**opposition**, **Enlightenment** ideas about moral responsibility made
it possible for]{.underline} individual **[autonomy]{.underline}** [in
a]{.underline} **[single lifetime]{.underline}** \-- the individual
creates her own fate through choices. [[Ethics]{.mark} is
thereby]{.underline} born, but only [in]{.underline}
**[opposition]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} the tradition of
**[hereditary]{.underline}** blessings and [**curses**. And the ethical
tradition of individual responsibility **[requires]{.mark}** the
tradition **against which it reacted**, as well as those who remain
identified with the \"blessing and curses\" tradition, that is,
**[racialized \"others.\"]{.mark}**]{.underline} Miller outlines these
core ideas in his Introduction. In chapter 1, he argues that ethical
emphases on deeds neglect accompanying evaluations of the agent. Chapter
2 considers how subjectivity could be \"reconfigured\" in terms of
affiliative relations that transfer value, when awareness of what is
determined could operate as a \"circuit breaker\" on the forces
determining value (pp. 77-8). Chapters 3 and 4 are an analysis of
ancient Greek and early Christian thought about the origination of value
and ethical knowledge as part of the natural world. Here, Miller shows
how value first emerged after action was deemed criminal, a structure
that is proto-typical for the historical emergence of race. Miller\'s
Conclusion is not a \"happy ending,\" because ethical inheritance still
dominates the subject seeking freedom and nothing, not even a reversal
of existing racial power structures, can undo the past. Miller ends with
a passage by James Baldwin which expresses a tension between acceptance
of cursed/criminalized inheritance in the first paragraph and a thirst
for vengeance in the second: The custodian of an inheritance, which is
what blacks have had to be, in Western culture, must hand the
inheritance down the line. So, you, the custodian, recognize, finally
that your life does not belong to you: nothing belongs to you. This will
not sound like freedom to Western ears, since the Western world pivots
on the infantile, and, in action, criminal delusions of possession, and
of property. . . . But the people of the West will not understand this
until everything which they now think they have has been taken away from
them. In passing, one may observe how remarkable it is that a people so
quick and so proud to boast of what they have taken from others are
unable to imagine that what they have taken from others can also be
taken from them. (p. 171) The controversy I predicted at the start of
this review is unlikely to unite moral philosophers and philosophers of
race, because both traditional moral philosophers and progressive
anti-racist philosophers will recognize a fundamental criticism of their
entire enterprise in this work. Enigmatic questions are raised for both
groups of scholars: [[Is race such a]{.underline} **[fundamental
category]{.underline}**]{.mark} [of human existence [that it
**overrides**]{.mark}]{.underline} basic assumptions about [[how
we]{.underline}]{.mark} can develop our characters and [[regard
others?]{.mark} Can the]{.underline} **[historical
contingency]{.underline}** [of race **override**]{.underline} the
**[more important]{.underline}** concerns and **[projects]{.underline}**
[involving]{.underline} **[character]{.underline}** development and
assessment**[?]{.underline}** [How does the importance of what we now
take to be ethical concerns and projects compare with the power of the
value-imbued]{.underline} **[ontology]{.underline}** [of
race?]{.underline} [[If race is]{.mark} already [embedded in]{.mark}
racial]{.underline} [[**ontology**, why]{.mark} is it [not]{.mark}
possible to]{.underline} [**[resolve that circularity through careful
analysis]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} **[recognizes]{.underline}**
[this]{.underline}]{.mark} [problem, [without seeking
to]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[purify racial
ontology]{.underline}**]{.mark} as it is commonly taken to be?
[[Philosophers of race]{.underline}]{.mark} might [already
recognize]{.underline} the [morally bad aspects]{.underline} of race
throughout history [and advocate mourning]{.underline} and memorial, [as
well as resolve to [resist]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[morally bad
aspects of race in their]{.mark} own [discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
fact, most philosophers of race who seek to retain racial categories
proceed exactly in that way. [[Similarly, ethicists could]{.mark} take
special care to [cultivate **awareness**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of how
**their moral prescriptions**]{.underline}]{.mark} and systems
**[[exclude]{.underline}]{.mark}** or already criminalize
**[[nonwhites]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Although]{.underline}, as noted,
[Miller]{.underline} [**[claims]{.underline}**
[that]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline} **[enterprise of
[ethics]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[is **impossible**]{.underline}
[without]{.underline}]{.mark} **[nonwhite]{.underline}** **[[racial
others]{.underline}]{.mark}** who are [[already
considered]{.underline}]{.mark} morally bad or [[not qualified to be
ethical subjects]{.underline}]{.mark} or objects, [[he has given
**little support for this sweeping assertion**. Surely, the
**abolitionist movement**]{.underline}]{.mark} against slavery, [white
[supporters of]{.mark}]{.underline} the U.S. **[[civil
rights]{.underline}]{.mark}** movement, [[and]{.mark} international
[humanitarian discourse **disturb** that
generalization]{.mark}]{.underline}, if only [[as an **empirical
matter**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Finally, although Miller resists
addressing race as racism, [it is difficult to understand how his
analysis of race as a stain that cannot be removed from ethics and his
analysis of ethics as **ineradicably white**]{.underline} (or not
nonwhite) [does]{.underline} **[not amount to deep
analysis]{.underline}** of anti-nonwhite racism. Miller\'s book is a
short, dense, brilliant, and fascinating work that is very important for
its historical and phenomenological depth of analysis. Miller\'s
analysis proceeds by unveiling or positing a horrible but compelling
prophecy that to remove ideas of nonwhite race as curse would also
remove the need for ethics. The question is whether there would be
interest in taking responsibility if some individuals were no longer
burdened by hereditary criminalization. [[The]{.underline}
**[illogic]{.underline}**]{.mark} [of this question, [that A is
motivated to be ethical **because B is not ethical**, is **alleviated**
if]{.mark} those [\"others\"]{.mark} so burdened [are **recognized as
projections of the ethical self**]{.mark}]{.underline} \-- [that is,
criminalized B is a projection of ethical A. Still, **[removing the need
for ethics]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[by removing]{.mark} what it is a

[criminalization]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [does]{.underline}
**[not]{.underline}**]{.mark} necessarily
**[[preclude]{.underline}]{.mark}** [some [people]{.mark} from
**[gratuitously choosing]{.mark}**]{.underline} to be [[**good**. That
already happens when ethics is purely secular and **some are

### AT: Cruel Optimism 

#### Their theory of cruel optimism is wrong\-\--the alt links to it\-\--cruel optimism is good when striving to improve society

**Ryan 16** (Mary K. Ryan, Virginia Tech, \"Finding a Better Society:
The Work of Lauren Berlant\'s Cruel Optimism\" Spectra: The Aspect
Journal, Vol 5, No 1 (2016),
https://spectrajournal.org/SPECTRA/article/view/347/225)

Lauren Berlant\'s 2011 book Cruel Optimism (Duke University Press) seeks
to understand how people survive neoliberal postwar restructuring. In
spite of deteriorating social, economic, and environmental conditions in
present-day Europe and the United States, Berlant finds that people
still remain attached to fantasies of the good life. It is in this
dichotomy that she frames her theory of cruel optimism, the \"relation
of attachment to compromised conditions of possibility whose realization
is discovered either to be impossible, sheer fantasy, or too possible,
and toxic.\"\[1\] [[Cruel optimism comes]{.mark} about [when individuals
remain attached to \"conditions of possibility]{.mark}\" or \"clusters
of promises\" which are embedded in desired objects or ideas, even when
those same objects or ideas inhibit people from acquiring or fulfilling
such items or promises]{.underline}.\[2\] [Berlant groups unachievable
fantasies of the good life into four categories]{.underline}: promises
of upward mobility, job security, political and social equality, and
durable intimacy.\[3\] [These four criteria constitute what
liberal-capitalist societies claim people must possess in order to make
life add up to something. Yet, society can no longer provide
opportunities for individuals to achieve such flourishing.]{.underline}
Berlant\'s primary inquiry is into these fantasies of the good life, and
she spends much of the book grappling to understand how and why
individuals cling to false promise. The process of survival is a bedrock
interest of this book. To understand how survival is possible, Berlant
pits the relational dynamic of striving against the structural feeling
of optimism. Here, optimism is a type of attachment which serves to
invest oneself into the plausibility of one\'s own survival or the
world\'s continuity. Perhaps counterintuitively, Berlant does not
require that optimism feel good, positive, or even optimistic; instead
she suggests that this dynamic \"\...might feel any number of
ways.\"\[4\] [This opens the door to people holding attachments which
may be injurious or cruel, whether to themselves and
others]{.underline}. **[Although it may be tempting to frame her
argument as a kind of masochism, [Berlant\'s analysis does not support
this interpretation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [She does not necessarily
find people receiving joy or pleasure from cruel optimism; **[she simply
perceives it as a mode of survival]{.mark}.** The affective structure
sustains cruel optimism, or, as Berlant puts it: \"the very pleasures of
being inside a relation have become sustaining regardless of the content
of the relation]{.underline}.\"\[5\] Ultimately, Berlant is not
concerned with the feeling\'s saliency, but, instead, with what people
do with this optimism. **[[Maintaining attachments to fantasies]{.mark}
of the good life, no matter how harsh reality might be, [enables people
to get through or endure life]{.mark} on a day-to-day basis, especially
[when]{.mark} day-to-day [lifestyles would be unlivable without some
kind of larger fantasy framework]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} In
this book, aesthetics is central to Berlant\'s method of understanding
the present. Berlant does not equate the lives of the aesthetic
characters she examines in her art, film, or literary analysis with
actual individual lives, but offers them as a model through which to
understand the lives of real people. As she puts it, aesthetics is not
\"equivalent to what happens to people but \[rather\] to see that in the
affective scenarios of these works and discourses we can discern claims
about the situation of contemporary life.\"\[6\] Berlant employs
aesthetics as a relationship between the rhythms of genre art and the
tempos of society. In other words, the destruction of the good life
\"manifests itself in an emerging set of aesthetic conventions that make
a claim to affective realism derived from embodied, affective rhythms of
survival.\"\[7\] Berlant not only ties our experience of the world to
aesthetics, but she endows aesthetics with the ability to
\"\...habituate our sensorium by taking in new material\" and \"provide
metrics for understanding how we pace and space our encounters with
things.\"\[8\] As the book progresses, however, [[Berlant\'s]{.mark}
general [reliance on aesthetics]{.mark} [comes to be
insufficient]{.mark} [for]{.mark} connecting her allusive examples to
[wider political discourse]{.mark}, effectually and inadvertently
[sidelining]{.mark} the critical [political practices]{.mark} this
cultural studies book contends to care about so deeply]{.underline}.
Berlant does not provide a detailed explanation for why she selects
particular works in the chapters of her book, making her range of
selections both eclectic and disorienting. Although Berlant notes that
Cruel Optimism continues an exploration of common themes in her work,
she appears to assume readers will naturally place this work alongside
her \"national sentimentality trilogy,\" which is comprised of The
Anatomy of National Fantasy, The Female Complaint, and The Queen of
America Goes to Washington City.\[9\] Her writing is highly
self-referential and she engages in ample self-citation throughout the
book. This tone sometimes feels exhausting and could be awkward for new
readers who may not draw the connections her references imply. Even for
those familiar with her other work, Berlant suggests that Cruel Optimism
moves beyond the \"normative modes of love and the law\" that
characterized her prior works, arguably making the references to her
earlier works a questionable marker to preface her writing with in the
first place.\[10\] Despite this stylistic liability, Berlant\'s use of
aesthetics is vital to how she understands shifts in conceptions of the
good life. She uses aesthetics to capture the present moment, a time she
characterizes as \"crisis ordinariness,\" and then to suggest the status
quo\'s \"impasse\" as a transitional opportunity where we come to
appreciate the shortcomings of genre to convey the present.\[11\] Each
chapter examines a different type of impasse and showcases ways
individuals are developing strategies for survival or adjusting ways of
getting by in response to fantasies of the good life which are no longer
sustainable. Berlant documents how individuals contribute to the
creation of new emergency aesthetic forms which navigate situations of
incoherence and precariousness. While Cruel Optimism does not identify
queer studies as a lodestone for itself, the book\'s argument is clearly
influenced by queer theory\'s tradition of challenging normative
categories of gender, bodies, and desire. Berlant\'s descriptive focus
on aesthetics and identity threaten to overwhelm her sincere interest in
agency, but as I will stress in my conclusion, there is no mistaking
this book as a call for action. In discussing her methodological
approach, Berlant asserts \"my method is to read patterns of adjustment
in specific aesthetic and social contexts to derive what\'s collective
about specific modes of sensual activity toward and beyond
survival.\"\[12\] She theorizes about the collective historical present
by first focusing on the particular. Yet, Berlant is also interested in
generalization. \"Generalization is part of my method, to track the
becoming general of singular things, and to give those things
materiality by tracking their resonances across many scenes, including
the ones made by nonverbal but still linguistic activities, like
gestures.\"\[13\] Given her focus on particular day-to-day actions,
Berlant perhaps surprisingly critiques everyday life theory because she
argues that it \"no longer describes how most people live.\"\[14\]
Instead, she places her work alongside Nigel Thrift\'s
Non-Representational Theory, Marc Augé\'s Non-Places: Essays on
Supermodernity, Michael Taussig\'s The Nervous System, and Kathleen
Stewart\'s Ordinary Affects because she feels they \"turn towards
thinking about the ordinary as an impasse shaped by crisis in which
people find themselves developing skills for adjusting to newly
proliferating pressures to scramble for modes of living on.\"\[15\]
Ultimately, Berlant uses specific examples to compile an archive of the
\"impasse or transitional moment\" to illustrate \"exemplary cases of
adjustment to the loss of this fantasy\" of the good life.\[16\] The
role of institutions is implicitly woven throughout Berlant\'s book.
Most directly, she uses the phrase \"precarious public sphere\" to
delimit the site upon which cruel optimism is played out. In this space,
we see \"an intimate public of subjects who circulate scenarios of
economic and intimate contingency and trade paradigms for how best to
live on.\"\[17\] Berlant presents a politically-motivated concept of the
historical present as a means to understand what forces are responsible
for whatever urgent crises have taken hold. She does not fully develop
objections to specific institutions that she deems culpable for the
calamities she examines; instead, she broadly hangs her argument on
liberal-capitalist societies in Europe and the United States. For this
reason, it seems Berlant agrees with Bourdieu\'s claim that the state
has a monopoly of power to carry out both legitimate and symbolic
violence. Bourdieu observes that \"state bureaucracies and their
representatives are great producers of \'social problems,\'\"\[18\] and
such \"social problems\" are reflected in Berlant\'s examination of
\"precarious bodies, subjectivity, and fantasy in terms of citizenship,
race, labor, class (dis)location, sexuality, and health.\"\[19\]
Bourdieu, drawing on Weber, argues that \"the state is an X (to be
determined) which successfully claims the monopoly of the legitimate use
of physical and symbolic violence over a definite territory and over the
totality of the corresponding population.\"\[20\] While Berlant does not
make the connection to Bourdieu that is being drawn here, and thus never
declares these allusions to state control directly, she nevertheless
ensconces Bourdieu\'s logic by placing total blame on the state for the
\"retraction of the social democratic promise of the post-Second World
War period in the United States and Europe.\"\[21\] Bourdieu and Berlant
go hand-in-hand; Cruel Optimism provides an in impactful, heartbreaking
illustration of fractured state policies and state violence practiced on
its population in the context of social norms of optimism. Berlant
provides a myriad of fascinating individual stories and genre examples
as a pathway to discussing collective, or mass, identity and ideology in
liberal-capitalist societies. She considers intuition to be the place
where affect meets history, claiming that \"affect theory is another
phase in the history of ideology theory.\"\[22\] In what sounds like a
21st c. update to psychoanalysis, Berlant expands Freud\'s assertion
that \"there is no negative in the unconscious\"\[23\] in observing that
\"the training of intuition\...enables us to formulate the investments
and incoherence of political subjectivity and subjectification in
relation to the world\'s disheveled but predictable dynamics.\"\[24\]
Berlant seeks to move beyond structure, agency, and disruption into a
new mode of analysis which examines \"adjudication, adaptation, and
improvisation\" amid the status quo, what she dubs \"a crisis-defined
and continuing now.\"\[25\] Although Berlant does not extrapolate
universally, she does seem to suggest that no one can escape an
affective mediation with the historical present: \"there is no place
sufficiently under the radar to avoid the insult that the world is not
organized around your sovereignty.\"\[26\] Individuality, anonymity and
trauma are at play here with each other. In one of the most sublime and
powerful remarks in Cruel Optimism, Berlant writes that \"one has only
been loaned a name and biography and personality and meaningfulness, and
that that loan could be recalled not just by death but by the cruel
forces of life, which include randomness but which are much more
predictable, systemic, and world-saturating than that too.\"\[27\] This
serves as a reminder that modern personal identity is always intimately
associated with sovereignty. Berlant adds great value to contemporary
social and psychological thought, by accentuating the role that slow
death, \"the condition of being worn out by the activity of reproducing
life,\"\[28\] plays in maintaining personal agency in everyday living.
Employing a summary of Marx\'s discussion of the body under regimes of
production, Berlant offers the example of the obesity epidemic to
display the confluence of concerns over personal health as not \"just a
\'crisis\' of judgement in the affective present but an ethico-political
condition\....\"\[29\] Moreover, she suggests that \"impassivity and
other politically depressed relations of alienation, coolness,
detachment, or distraction, especially in subordinated populations, can
be read as affective forms of engagement with the environment of slow
death\....\"\[30\] This results in her vivid portrayal of citizens as
\"\...survivalists, scavengers bargaining to maintain the paradox of
entrepreneurial optimism against defeat by the capitalist destruction of
life.\"\[31\] Berlant\'s uses psychological and physical health to
demonstrate pathways of personal endurance as well as social resistance.
[[Berlant]{.mark} writes extensively about how people in everyday life
survive and relate to cruel optimism, but [hardly deliberates on]{.mark}
the other half of the equation: **[how government action creates such a
situation]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Berlant assumes capitalist
destruction is understood by her readers. [Berlant writes \"capitalist
activity always induces destabilizing scenes of productive
destruction,\" but offers no specific proof]{.underline}.\[32\] Although
one might agree that people are probably aware of things reported on in
the mainstream media such as unemployment or outsourcing, one may
question if most people connect the dots on a deeper level, as Berlant
does, to these problems being symptoms indicating the fragility of the
capitalist system. Moreover, she makes a mistake to presume the
experience of or reaction to destruction can always be shared,
consistent, or mutually identified. Another way the reader can observe
that Berlant is on a different level of analysis, and further
justification for why her assumptions ought to be stated more directly,
can be found in her understanding of political terms. Take \"hegemony,\"
for example. It is reasonable to presume most people conceive of
hegemony as broadly having to do with power. Yet, in Berlant\'s
discussion of hegemony, she rejects this common conception, claiming
that \"to see hegemony as domination and subordination is to disavow how
much of a dependable life relies on the sheerly optimistic formalism of
attachment.\"\[33\] Moreover, when she writes that the hardest problem
is \"understanding the difficulty of unlearning attachments to regimes
of injustice,\" she seems to conflate personal attachments with formal
systems of (in)justice.\[34\] A few more background claims about her
understanding of what capitalism and neoliberalism have done to the
world might have meant the book would be de-cloistered a bit, helping it
speak to a larger audience. Cruel Optimism is a valuable, provocative
book about the future of institutions, intimacy, obligation, and
responsibility. [[Berlant]{.underline} [seeks]{.underline}
[alternatives]{.underline}]{.mark} for remaking the fantasmatic/material
infrastructure of collective life, [[concluding]{.underline}]{.mark}
that \"[[no form of being]{.mark} in the political or
politics---[**including withdrawing from them**---will solve the
problem]{.mark} of shaping the impasse of the historical
present]{.underline}.\"\[35\] When Berlant provocatively asks \"Why
should you be spared?\" she is of course referring to literal aging and
death, but also to our shared experience of \"living amid the breakup of
modernity\'s secure institutions\" ---the state, the corporation, the
family, and politics.\[36\] Berlant wants the reader to disabuse one\'s
\"freedom from the obligation to pay attention to much, whether personal
or political\".\[37\] In Cruel Optimism, [Berlant places the reader at
the center of a crisis for social change which she considers to be the
new ordinary: despite ideas of better good lives ahead, we know it is
awkward and threatening to break away, even from something we know is
not working.]{.underline} As this visceral and intimate book shows,
**[[Berlant does not wish to spare]{.mark} you from the [painful work of
cultivating a better society]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

### AT: Curry 

#### Curry votes aff\-\--an understanding of Blackness as within the world is necessary to retake notions of humanity from Western 'Man'

Ebony A. **Utley and Curry 16**, associate professor, Department of
Communication Studies @ CSU Long Beach, and Tommy J. Curry, associate
professor of philosophy @ Texas A&M, 7-29-2016, "Humanizing Blackness:
An Interview with Tommy J. Curry," *Southern Communication Journal*, Vol
81:4, pg. 263-265

**[Curry]{.underline}**: [[**Most people** think of Blackness]{.mark}
and how we study Blackness [as]{.mark} a negative endeavor. It's [always
associated with **oppression**]{.mark}**, pathology, suffering.**
[There's another way]{.mark} that we could look at Blackness as an
alternate version of the human being.]{.underline} Like a human being
that's [made within history, [that]{.mark} really [**stands within the
courage** and **enduring** of **slavery, suffering, and
poverty**]{.mark}---an evolved kind of humanity that's **[of the world
and not something that stands outside of it.]{.mark}** We usually
associate humanity with whiteness, reason, virtue]{.underline}, and all
of these things that we haven't really realized in the world. [With
Blackness you get that quality of the human that is found within
triumph, struggle, and resistance[. Resistance is a human quality that
Black people possess **because they're human**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but
there is something else about [Black humanity]{.underline} that [is
unique]{.underline}, that comes about [because of slavery, Jim Crow,
rape, castration. These types of things are peculiar to Black people,
and because of that, their humanity]{.underline}, as it interacts with
the world[, has created this unique thing that we now think of in terms
of Blackness.]{.underline} Utley: Can anyone who accepts the definition
of Blackness as the condition of being a human being, consider
themselves Black? Curry: No. When we talk about the quality of Blackness
what we're actually talking about is awareness about the conditions that
have been brought about through colonization through racism, through
poverty, through disease, through wretchedness. The question is: Do you
have it? Do you have the history or the trauma of slavery, or
colonization, or genocide? Of being marked, targeted, and exposed? Do
you experience the world as a social death, always able to be killed
because of the continuous violence towards Black people? Utley: If an
individual is phenotypically Black, but does not experience the word
this way, is this person still Black per your definition? Curry: Yes,
because it's not about the consciousness of "this is the life I've
lived," it's the possibility of existence in this world. I can walk off
the cliff and say that I don't believe in gravity, but I'm not less
affected by gravity. If I walk off the cliff, I'm still dead. That's
what I mean. Consider whiteness, even if you're a poor white person that
could be killed by the cops, the question is "Do you live your life as
if the very condition of living is formulated on death?" [White
people]{.underline}, even poor white people, [don't go through moments
of life where they know that their disposability is fundamentally
necessary for everyone else's existence. Young black men certainly do.
The exploitation of black women certainly makes that true. They're the
disposable and the exploitable.]{.underline} People can say that bad
shit happens to other people too, and I'm in complete agreement with
that. It doesn't disown that there are different kinds of experiences,
but [when you talk about Blackness in America, you're talking about how
groups of people who are descendants of slaves and colonialism whose
**existence** within the empire is **conditioned by
death.**]{.underline} That's a very different thing. [And yet, [there's
something]{.mark} in Black people [that says **resist**. That's]{.mark}
the question of [how **humanity is being created and reformed.**]{.mark}
We don't get that complexity[. **We study Blackness and Black people**
as if]{.mark} they were [a **reflection of certain political
ideologies**, not the **consciousness** of a people who think]{.mark}
that [they should **actually be able to live**,]{.mark} **to be
citizens**]{.underline}, husbands, or wives. [These are]{.underline} all
[complex emotions that exist in human societies that are studied across
the world, but are **never utilized to study Black
people.**]{.underline} Utley: How should we study Black people? Curry:
In my work I refer to that as the culture-logic---an idea to frame how
Black people create the world through a co-authoring of the world. [How
does the human being interact with the world, not as a **distant
object**, but literally how do they make it, form it, contour it so that
it reflects their own existence? This replaces]{.underline} things that
we talk about now like [phenomenology, critical theory, or
even]{.underline} basic concepts of metaphysics like [ontology or
epistemology. Because what we're talking about is how the world and the
human are necessary to create social reality.]{.underline} They don't
exist separate from each other. [When we study Blackness we like to
**study** it as a **material artifact** that's **outside of our
perception.** So racism becomes an **object of our study.** It doesn't
become]{.underline} something that is [created and co-created. We see
Black people's problems when we study Black people in that way, and it
reproduces some of the assumptions of inhumanity. Because **if we
thought of ourselves as human, then we would create
realities**]{.underline} just like white people create realities. Utley:
How do white and Black reality creation processes differ? Curry: White
people project themselves into the future all the time. They're building
ideas that are going to set the foundation, like in technology, in
astrophysics etc., that set the foundations for generations ahead of
them. [White people fundamentally **believe they're human**, so their
advances are grounding]{.underline} for future generations centuries
later. [Black people **can't speak** in that way because we **don't
fundamentally believe** that **Blackness** is a **foundation to
humanity**, such that it has anything to contribute to civilization.
That's a very different intellectual space to produce knowledge if you
believe that you are simply a **fleeting contingent** of an
**environmental circumstance**. That you have no separate history,
aspiration, or vision for what the world could]{.underline} or could not
[be.]{.underline} We don't expect this for other groups of people, but
ask Black people what they contribute besides reform of the empire? And
they're like, "We don't know because that's not what we teach our
scholars to think towards." [We have to refocus our lens in a very
serious way.]{.underline} Utley: Is there one academic discipline that
refocuses Blackness better than others? Curry: No. Utley: They're all
equally failing? Curry: Yes. [Disciplines are]{.underline} the specific
[articulations of how we've divvied up Western concepts of the human.
Sociology is a reflection of how the European man exists within colonial
society.]{.underline} Economics is how the European man rationalizes
self-interest profiting in colonial societies. Philosophy, how do
Western men fit themselves in relationship to all other people who are
not as rational or human? Disciplines are merely reflections of
different pieces or aspects of one concept of the human. [When writing
about Blackness [we have to **challenge ourselves** to **not study**
]{.mark}**Blackness or [race-theory]{.mark}** [as if it's **one aspect**
of how **Western bourgeois man rationalizes Black
lives**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is what I think a lot of our work
turns into. [The issue is how do we separate from a study based on that
separation, not how we regret the distance race puts us from an ideal
white notion of humanity.]{.underline}

### AT: Fixed 

#### Structural racism is not a fixed feature of society\-\--it can be named, challenged, and reduced\-\--legal reforms that target anti-black structures are radical politics that fundamentally alters psychological conceptions of anti-blackness 

**Omi & Winant 8** -- \*Associate professor of ethnic studies and acting
director of the Institute for the Study of Social Change at the
University of California, Berkeley, \*\*Professor of sociology at the
University of California, Santa Bar bara, where he founded and directs
the UCSB Center for New Racial Stud (Michael, Howard, PMLA, Vol. 123,
No. 5, Special Topic: Comparative Racialization (Oct., 2008), pp.
1565-1572, Once More, with Feeling: Reflections on Racial Formation)

One of the central arguments we make in Racial Formation is that the
[post-World War II [**movements** for **racial equality**]{.mark} and
justice in the United States politicized the social. The long-delayed
eruption of racial subjectivity]{.underline} and self-[awareness into
the mainstream political arena [set off a **massive transformation in
the very nature of politics**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Through its
politicization of the social, [[the black freedom movement]{.mark} and
its allies **[both under mined and contradicted]{.mark}** **[traditional
concepts of politics]{.mark}** [and, in so doing, **reshaped**]{.mark}
both [the democratic]{.mark} and despotic [prospects for]{.mark}
American **[politics]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This was an unstable and at
times explosive transition with seismic ef fects. Though centered on the
issue of race, the political transformation went far beyond race to
encompass issues of gender and sexu ality, war and peace, and
citizenship, among a host of other issues. [Postwar social
movements]{.underline} in the United States [provided the link between
the experiential and institutional dimensions of politics]{.underline}.5
What we call [a \"racial project\" establishes this link]{.underline}.
We defined a racial project as \"simultaneously an interpretation, repre
sentation, or explanation of racial dynamics, and an effort to
reorganize and redistribute resources along particular racial lines\"
(56). Reflecting on this definition, Nguyen mis understands our notion
of \"racial projects,\" suggesting that our usage of the term is \"pri
marily about material resources.\" [Nguyen claims that our concern with
the state and with politics \"leads them to argue that race is chiefly
articulated through class.\"]{.underline} We were a bit surprised by
this misreading in an oth erwise excellent piece, since we are at pains
in our book to challenge reductions of race to class and indeed include
a chapter that ad dresses the problem. In fact[, we are more accustomed
to the opposite criticism: that we don\'t take class seriously
enoug]{.underline}h.6 We argue that [racial projects large and
small]{.underline} [from mass actions or **[comprehensive]{.mark}
[legislation]{.mark}**]{.underline} (examples [**[located at the
macrosocial level]{.mark}**) to]{.underline} speech acts or [personal
experiences of prejudice]{.underline} or discrimination (examples
located at the microsocial level)?**[[accrete over historical time to
shape both the racialized social structure and our psychic structure as
racial subjects]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [[The linkages between racial
signification and racialized social structure are ongoing and intrinsic
as well as **unstable and conflictual**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Any claim
to a racial identity nec essarily connects the claimant to others mak
ing similar claims and to the sociohistorical system in which that
identity acquires mean ing. [This equation works in reverse as well:
when social, political, or economic institutions allocate resources
along racial lines, they]{.underline} nec essarily [assign individuals
and groups to racial categories. They are \"signifying\" race even when
denying that they\'re doing so.]{.underline} Self-Activity and
Self-Recognition in a Racialized World Koshy writes, \"The
representational strain of dealing with the elusive and dynamic quali
ties of racial and sexual identities makes us too eager to declare that
we are over difference.\" Indeed, if we cannot act outside the domain of
racism, if we cannot understand our identities outside the
interpellative reach of racialization, how can we achieve the more
autonomous self recognition that we desire? Lee asks, \"How can we make
race matter so that it attends to the exile of our longing\'\... and
invites others to imagine resistance as a life\'s work and power as acts
of making and remaking?\" In many ways, racial identity continues to
embody what DuBois called \"unreconciled strivings\" (DuBois, Souls 11).
The simultane ous avowal and disavowal of racial politics shapes (and
debilitates) political language and strategic thinking: in electoral
politics, vocab ularies of personal, collective, and national identity
and visions of equality and social jus tice. The challenges in the
post-civil-rights era seem daunting, and the problems that have emerged
seem irresolvable. Koshy notes that in this contemporary context,
\"racial injury comes to operate as a differend since it marks the
impossibility of articulating an injustice within the existing system of
discourse.\" Lee states that \"\[a\] 11 [we have to work with are the
master\'s tools, and we dream for other ones]{.underline}; we look for
resistance but settle formulticul turalism; [we critique the power that
power imposes on us, and this intellectual work leaves us breathless at
the end of the day.\" Though it may be heretical to say so, we do have
more to work with than the master\'s tools: **[we have pragmatism, the
radical pragmatism that proceeds from deep commitments to
democracy.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[Radical pragma ism suggests that we
see racial politic]{.underline}s]{.mark} (and politics) **[[as an
ongoing creative practice]{.underline}]{.mark}**, that we understand
self-reflective action as an everyday matter. Conscious or unconscious,
acknowledged or denied, the racial organiza tion of everyday life is
omnipresent: where we live, the work we do, what we eat and what we
wear, the language we speak and the idioms we use, the television
programs we watch; in short, nearly every aspect of our everyday lives
is shaped in crucial ways by race[. Self-activity and self-reflective
action are at the heart of the radical pragmatist
perspective]{.underline}.7 It reflects a more robust view of democ racy,
something already [visible in John Dewey]{.underline}, George Herbert
Mead, W[. E. B. DuBois,]{.underline} Alain Locke, [Iris Marion Young,
and many others]{.underline}. Such an approach can help us develop a
more advanced theory of race and racism.8 A radical democratic
pragmatism, for example, might help us rethink the pressing issue of
race-gender-class intersectionality (Crenshaw; Hancock; Collins). Nguyen
notes (citing Sau-ling Wong) that there is a ram pant tendency to
\"ethnicize gender.\" There is also the opposite tendency, the
\"gendering of race\": consider the \"threat\" posed by young black men,
the age-old debates over mascu linity in black intellectual and
political terri tories, the associations made by Islamophobes (when
convenient) of Islam and sexism. For all this traffic across the
race-gender frontier, however, the explanatory framework for
intersectionality studies remains elusive. Unquestionably, a general
parallel exists be tween racial and gender-based oppressions and
emancipatory claims. Simone de Beau voir explicitly modeled her
pioneering ac count in feminist theory, The Second Sex, on working-class
and anticolonial struggles of emancipation. The key parallels she
stressed included rule through chattelization, the as signment of
political status based on corpo real characteristics, \"isolation
effects\" such as \"seriality\" and alienation, and the internal ization
of domination. Numerous other com mon experiences link these axes of
power and resistance. Yet movements based on race, gen der, and labor
have always teetered between convergence and divergence, in the United
States and elsewhere. That\'s at the macro social, institutional level.
At the microsocial, or experiential, level a similar uncertainty op
erates: involvement in multiple oppressions, for example, often forces
us (and especially forces women) to choose our battles. We con front
competing demands for solidarity, often across race, class, or gender
lines. Rather than lament the dilemmas en countered across different
axes of stratifi cation and difference, we must learn from them?chiefly
about the instability in prac tice of our concepts of race, gender,
class, sexuality, ethnicity, and so forth. Under standing
intersectionality requires a strong recognition that self-reflective
action shapes the production and transformation of indi vidual and
collective identities. Self-activity happens as we choose our battles in
the con tradictory conditions of the post-civil-rights and, yes,
post-second-wave-feminism pe riods that we are now in. [The achievements
of past decades provide a new repertoire of political and performative
resources]{.underline}, **[a more developed political-armaments
depot]{.underline}**, if you like, f**[rom which we can draw our ammuni
tion]{.underline}**. Perhaps coded racial appeals have lost some of
their effectiveness.9 [Raciality and gender status]{.underline} now
operate much more comprehensively in the contradictory fashion we have
suggested than they did in the past. As inheritors of the politicization
of the social, they [are today formidable vehicles of collective
interpellation and self-interpellation]{.underline}, but at the same
time they operate in a continuing framework of structural racism,
neoliberal ism (i.e., superexploitation on a world scale), and
masculinism. Leaders and movements indeed, **[all political actor, are
steering their boats through these treacherous shoals]{.underline}**.
Interdisciplinarity Where scholarly works on race are concerned,
interdisciplinarity should be more properly the norm than the exception.
We should be suspicious of imposed disciplinary bound aries and should
mistrust claims to preemi nence from those in the social sciences and
the humanities, as well as the natural and biological sciences. Koshy
argues that \"\[s\]ocial-scientific par adigms, which laid the
groundwork for the modern study of race, are suffering from rep
resentational fatigue in addressing the way in which racial realities
have morphed.\" While we can certainly see her point, we doubt that it
can be applied so comprehensively to any discipline (much less a group
of disciplines) without immediately eliciting relevant coun terexamples.
This is as true ofthe humanities as it is ofthe social sciences, of
course. Social science has long been divided by what Immanuel
Wallerstein?drawing on a long tradition in the history of ideas?charac
terized as \"nomothetic\" versus \"idiographic\" forms of knowledge.
Literary scholarship, especially over recent decades, has sought to
manage theories based on a heterodox set of approaches: remember
deconstruc tion, reception theory, historicism? If these frameworks are
more than trends or fads, it is at least in part because they attempt to
synthesize perspectives that cut across disci plinary lines and refuse
the division between the humanities and the social sciences. In our view
there are no serious claims to be made for coherence on the part of any
discipline, or group of disciplines, beyond those of taste? for a
certain canon, method, or focus of in quiry. This is especially true for
racial studies, which (among their many sins) turn out to be
constitutive of our disciplines rather than constituted by them.10
Returning once more to the concept of racial projects, we see that one
key idea un derlying this concept?of what might be called building
blocks in racial-formation processes?is that there can be no racial rep
resentation, no signification on race, that does not immediately and
necessarily invoke social structures, power relations, lived expe
riences of identity and difference. This point might be seen as
Foucauldian, an association we happily uphold, but it can also be linked
to the pragmatist current. Consider Herbert Blumer\'s equation of
prejudice and group po sition, DuBois\'s veil, or Eddie Glaude\'s quest
for a \"post-soul\" politics of black liberation. In the Twenty-First
Century Lee discerns a \"resignation\" in Racial For mation, especially
in the second edition, and links it with various works on the \"melan
cholia\" that succeeded the containment of the movement for racial
justice (especially under Reagan). There is something in this. [Of
course, structural racism persists: it is visible in the accumulated
weight of past racist practices in the legacy of a system of slavery
that has been \"unwilling to die]{.underline}\" (Douglas\'s con curring
opinion in Jones v. Mayer 445; Fea gin), [in the continuity
of]{.underline} nativism and [white racial nationalism]{.underline}
(Brimelow; Berlet and Ly ons; Huntington), [in the way the racially un
equal distribution of resources in the past has structured continuing
inequality and injustice in the present]{.underline} (Oliver and
Shapiro), and in a potentially long list of cognate examples. **[[The
racial reforms won by our movements were]{.mark} not only [real
victories]{.mark};]{.underline}** they also marked a defeat of our more
radical aspirations. The incorporation of our demands (equality, jus
tice, inclusion) in the warped and denatured form of \"color blindness\"
reinforced the un derlying racist system we set out to destroy[. Yet
that is not the end of the story.]{.underline} To challenge the new
racial hegemony will require a serious engagement not only with the
politics of identity but also with the struc tural racism against which
race-conscious subjects must contend and in which they are
simultaneously embedded. The politicization of the social made that
engagement more pos sible, because it allowed us to see everyday life as
a field of struggle against racism. [We live in racial history.
**[Structural rac ism is not a fixed feature of United States so ciety.
It can be named; it can be challenged; it can be
reduced]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We ended the second edition of Racial
Formation with an injunction to \"notice\" race. Tlie contradiction
between that necessity and the uncertain denial involved in color
blindness identifies the racial battlefield ofthe twenty-first century.

### AT: Fugitivity 

#### Blackness is not para-ontological\-\--Moten's theory can never move beyond fugitivity and relies on a misapplication of Fanon and Heidegger

David **Marriott 16**. Professor, UC Santa Cruz. "Cultural Studies in
Emerging Knowledge." Rhizomes 29: 1-5.
<http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/pdf/marriott.pdf>.

\[4\] Crucially, Moten presents his argument not as a \'refusal\' of
Fanon, but as a \'demand that we read\' his texts as if \'for the first
time\'.\[9\] This would mean that any reading of Fanon must begin
naively (etymologically speaking), without prejudice or prescription:
it\'s a demand that recalls phenomenology\'s approach to things/sachen
(an approach in which reading is both a bracketing and a reduction).
This scene is immediately complicated, however, in that naïve reading,
which in this hypothesis or story is to begin without judgment,
reappears in the prescription that we read naively. Indeed, if naivety
is demanded what would it mean to prescribe Fanon\'s texts as the
addressee of that naivety? And if one accepted, with Moten, that such
naïve reading constitutes neither a refusal nor judgment of Fanon, and
if it were decided that such reading could also be named a refusal of
refusal (of Fanon\'s disavowing claim), then the complication only
spreads. That demand for naivety, which describes itself as black
optimism, is in turn derived from a certain reading of Heidegger. It is
from the latter that Moten rapidly determines what it means to give the
\'case\' of blackness a hearing, to register the optimism of its
outpouring despite the \'horror of its making\', or the horror from
which it was made.\[10\] The word \'case\' must be understood as both a
tribunal and its hearing, but \'case\' too in the sense of
psychopathology: here [Moten does not explain why]{.underline},
nominally speaking, [the case of blackness should take the form of a
juridical dispute between Fanon and Heidegger, nor why that dispute
should be settled by the latter\'s account of \'representational
thinking\']{.underline}.\[11\] In terms of the law applicable to this
case, Fanon\'s crime, then, would be his failure to think beyond law or
pathology, or to imagine a new set of possibilities as defined by
Heidegger\'s ontological naivety---but also that the latter\'s claim to
return representation to its ontological ground (as too in Moten\'s
constant implicit claim to give blackness a hearing) merely means that
Fanon\'s own critique of ontology is inevitably reduced to a litigious
politics of representation. \[5\] We know that the case of blackness
(and its juridical rhetoric) includes at least two questions: what is
this thing called blackness and how is it to be represented? The
junction at which these two questions meet in Peau noire, masques blancs
is that of a flaw: this flaw is born very specifically from an
experience of ruination \'that interdicts any ontological
explanation\'.\[12\] In the colony, the phenomenological form of social
power is never immediate, that is to say, a relation of representation,
but a confrontation that designifies, and, at the same time, resignifies
social relations once they are racially determined, a confrontation in
which both being and law acquire new significations born out of
disavowal (what Fanon defines as the lactifying desire for substitution
or separation of the black from the négre, and of the white from its
other) and of amplification (the recoding of the social and symbolic
order by racial signifiers of precarity and threat, fear and
impoverishment). [Saying that there is a question whether blackness is
disavowed in Fanon, a [disavowal]{.mark} whose meaning is in dispute,
**[does not]{.mark}**]{.underline}, however, [**[explain]{.mark}** why
Moten continues to use the language of [ontology]{.mark} and of law to
explain Fanon\'s writing on blackness as a phenomenology]{.underline}.
[The [etymology of]{.mark} the word [\'case\']{.mark}]{.underline} also
[[includes]{.mark} that of **[contingency]{.mark}**]{.underline} and of
fall (lapsus); [that is to say, the meaning of [blackness is **not
prescribed**]{.mark}, and has no prior signification before it is
raced]{.underline}. This contingency or fall (the lapsus or trauma of
racialization) denotes not a prescribed imperfection but refers to the
time, paradoxically enough, in which the black comes face to face with
its own contaminating filiation with the négre, a confrontation that is
never simply in the order of an object, but is that of an exposure that
is also the work of a certain concealment; it is a moment in which any
simple history (of escape or confinement, mimicry or identification) is
necessarily the impure avowal of an imaginary longing for a colorless
presence, meaning, or proximity. [[If]{.mark} one accepts, along with
Moten, that [blackness always escapes]{.mark} its positioning in either
[law or representation, and]{.mark} if it were to be shown that
[neither]{.mark} that [law]{.mark} (or its history) [nor]{.mark} that
[representation]{.mark} (or its history) [can capture]{.mark} \'the case
[blackness]{.mark} makes for itself in spite of and by way of every
interdiction\', according to which this case names both a specific
pathology and object, [then **why** hold onto]{.mark} this [juridical
rhetoric]{.mark} (with respect to the case) to present that [which
**apparently** always escapes law and
representation?]{.mark}]{.underline}\[13\] \[6\] [[By writing blackness
as]{.mark} ceaseless [fugitivity]{.mark}, Moten]{.underline} has [moved
towards a position in which [blackness is only black when it exceeds its
racist disavowal]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Or, the blackness of blackness
can only be recognized as black in so far as it escapes the racism of
its history: but what allows us to see this escape is not blackness, but
its racist disavowal]{.underline}. Or, [in order to reconcile blackness
with that which blackness supposedly is, [Moten has to rely on the
narrative of its]{.mark} constraint or [pathology, **which he cannot do
without**]{.mark}]{.underline}: this pathology enables Moten to avoid
the disavowing naiveties of Fanon but only in so far as he too reads
naively, or optimistically. A third possibility would make this
disavowing claim, that Moten wants to make deliver up its secrets, a
sign of how Moten himself disavows how racist disavowal complicates his
reading of what he describes as Fanon\'s phenomenology, in which
impurity inevitably generates a pathological meaning. Or again: if Fanon
hears what Moten does not hear (in terms of his reading of the case),
this is because [Moten can only affirm blackness as affirmation, not
because it escapes pathology, but because [blackness is experienced
**only** as]{.mark} the activity of [escape, but]{.mark} one which
**[never escapes the ontology]{.mark} of such
[production]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [It follows that [blackness **cannot
escape** its own fugitivity]{.mark}; its constitutive moment is
traversal (or, what constitutes it is its force of subversion with
regard to the pathological classifications of blackness)]{.underline}.
If Fanon fails \'to investigate more adequately the change from object
to thing\', one could also suggest [[this failure]{.underline}]{.mark}
fails to address, or **[[forecloses]{.underline}]{.mark}**, that other
scene in Fanon; in short, [[how the]{.mark} very [distinction between
**object and thing** refuses to engage]{.mark} with [the]{.mark}
Fanonian [unconscious]{.mark} ([in which the object is **neither**
simply represented nor simply fugitive to the]{.mark} languages of
[**law**, **ontology**, or **difference**]{.mark})]{.underline}.\[14\]
[The form of this problem seems to be linked to what can appear to be a
persistent equivocation in Moten\'s reading of Fanon between apparently
ontological claims and the use of the aesthetic-political to somehow
escape ontology]{.underline}. [This situation, which would demand new
formulations of the relationship between ontology and the
aesthetic-political, is perhaps programmed by the logic of a
presentation which needs to see a radical break between them, a
necessity whose prescription is also thus **disavowed**]{.underline}.
\[7\] [This scenario is not an easy one to follow]{.underline}, and
might therefore be described as itself Fanonian. Moten defines as black
a situation in which the obligation to steal away goes along with a
\'movement of escape\' that is not criminal and cannot be \'enframed\'
as such. Moten states this movement as follows: blackness is \'an
ensemble always operating in excess of that ancient juridical
formulation of the thing\', it is \'a stolen, transplanted organ always
eliciting rejection\', and, \'the lived experience of blackness is,
among other things, a constant demand for an ontology of disorder, an
ontology of dehiscence\' and so on.\[15\] [Aside from noting the logical
instability of this \'always\': namely, [if x is always escaping then it
cannot]{.mark} be said to [ever entirely escape]{.mark}, it is clear
that, [according to **Moten\'s own logic**]{.mark}, these descriptions
leave it completely undecidable whether blackness is fugitive because it
**never** quite escapes (its enslavement, its impurity), or whether it
always thereby escapes how it is rendered black, or not, precisely
because it is not an object]{.underline}. Moten refers to this situation
as the \'special ontic-ontological fugitivity of/in the slave\' which he
says is \'necessarily unaccounted for in Fanon\'.\[16\] I am not going
to provide any detailed commentary on this word \'necessarily\',
although it would not be difficult to construct an argument showing that
[Fanon]{.underline}, in so far as he [insists on the necessary
mis-recognition of blackness as black, is]{.underline} in fact in some
senses [the most radical discourse of why blackness remains unaccounted
for]{.underline}. Nor would it be difficult to argue that [Fanon escapes
the hold of the pathological/normative opposition]{.underline}. I shall
also try to resist the temptation of denouncing [a very general tendency
to present the operation of disavowal as a \'critique\' of]{.underline}
what Fanon himself says about [racist disavowal]{.underline}, of
assuming that when Fanon says that [black lived experience names both a
specific discourse of misrecognition and the symptom of that
misrecognition, that attempts to name misrecognition, such as Moten\'s,
which attempt to position Fanonism as a misrecognition of what blackness
is, would themselves]{.underline} not **[generate further cases of
misrecogniton]{.underline}**, or escape [the naivety of such
optimism]{.underline}. Instead, I shall narrow down the scenario still
further and consider something like the logic of escape in Moten\'s
engagement with phenomenology, especially with respect to his own
representations of the aesthetic-political. This restriction will seem
only the more excessive in that I shall appeal to only a very small part
of Moten\'s case history, ignoring notably all of what he says about art
here, and concentrating on what he says about theft, in the sense of
stolen from or dispossession. \[8\] After citing Heidegger\'s famous
reading of the jug in the essay, \"Das Ding\", [Moten argues that Fanon
confuses the black\'s \'becoming-object\' for the thing that blackness
is]{.underline}, which exceeds the jurisdiction of racist discourse and
its formulation of an \'impure, degraded, manufactured (in)human who
moves only in response to inclination, whose reflexes lose the name of
action\'.\[17\] So that in contradistinction to Fanon, [Moten wants to
present \'the inadequacy of any ontology to blackness\' as the
inadequacy of \'calculation to being in general\' and then show how
blackness as lived is \'a constant demand for an ontology of disorder,
an ontology of dehiscence\']{.underline}.\[18\] [[The
**problem**]{.mark} with this approach [is its]{.mark} particular
**[determination of history as filiation]{.mark}**: Moten\'s commitment
to black social life, to its vitality, [leads him to
provide]{.mark}]{.underline}, in section one, [[an]{.mark}
anything-but-Fanonian [history]{.mark} of racist philosophy ([in which
blackness is always the sign of negation]{.mark})]{.underline}. This is
the context in which Fanon sets out his reading of blackness as
interdiction or flaw. [Because he fails to read this context, Moten is
obliged to read the figure of impurity as part of a history of
philosophy rather than as one of Fanon\'s essential points **critiquing
philosophical historicity**, which queries how the being of the black
has been understood in both the history of philosophy and the
philosophical history of the concept of \'race\']{.underline}.
[Consequently, Fanonism is viewed as an aberrational consequence of that
history, rather than **one of its sharpest critiques**]{.underline}.
\[9\] [This leads Moten to present a history]{.underline} of Fanonism
[that puts Fanon in the same company as that of Daniel Patrick Moynihan
(!)]{.underline}---suffice it to say I think that it\'s a horrible
philosophical travesty of Fanon to present his work as the antecedent of
this anti-black moralist from the US. Moten knows all this too. [Whence
the [**effect of decontextualisation**: the **price paid** for]{.mark}
the **[naivety]{.mark}** of his reading [never]{.mark} essentially [goes
beyond]{.mark} a **[restricted]{.mark} set of [prescriptions]{.mark}**
[that]{.mark}, even when they take the form of **endless questioning**,
[are **necessarily disavowed**]{.mark}]{.underline}. One consequence of
this is that [Moten\'s own placing of Fanon in a tradition dominated by
the representation of black pathology is]{.underline} also [dominated by
the need to present Fanonism as, paradoxically, a pathological
object]{.underline}. Lastly, let us recall that Moten\'s philosophical
reading of Fanon wants to question what he sees as a particular,
pessimistic inflection, which is marked by the absence of black social
life. It\'s a reading in whose exposition the discontinuity of black
social life is determined as [a kind of pious optimism, or in Moten\'s
terms a paraontological form of resistance]{.underline}. The case of
blackness, in [[Moten\'s transcription]{.mark} of Heidegger, [has **no
code of law**]{.mark} or body of jurisprudence or rule of representation
to determine its ontology for \'its relation to law is reducible neither
to simple interdiction nor bare transgression]{.underline}.\'. [The law
for the case of blackness must be found, invented]{.underline}. [**But**
if the black judge or critic has **no law** at hand, it would seem that
the possibility of judging is given in the name of an
aesthetic-political optimism: [our task]{.mark} here]{.underline} (that
of \'judging Fanon\') [[puts us in the situation of having to judge the
case]{.mark} which thus prescribes judgment -- [of **blackness as
pathology**]{.mark}---[**without grounding** its being in or as
pathology]{.mark}]{.underline}: [[Moten]{.mark} therefore [repeats the
pathological **presupposition of a judgment**]{.mark} (of black
pathology) [in the attempt to judge it
non-pathologically]{.mark}]{.underline}. The phrase \'Fanon is too
pessimistically black\' names an example (which cannot just be an
example) of this situation. Fanon is too black (or not black enough)
because he can only see blackness as instituted out of violence and
pathology, out of the lived experience of racism, and this violence
returns to question the institution of black social life even as it
constitutes it. In a brilliant article called \"The Social Life of
Social Death\", Jared Sexton, wondering what happens when blackness
determines itself as essentially \'pathological\' (Moten\'s word),
suggests that Fanon (as opposed to his blackness) names the limits of
this very situation.\[19\] [The question of the pathologization of
blackness is]{.underline} then, says Sexton, [\'a reinscription of
(black) pathology [that **reassigns its cause** and **relocates its
source without ever getting inside it\'**]{.mark};]{.underline}
\'another way of putting this might be to say that [they \[the thinkers
of blackness as pathology\] are caught in [a **performative
contradiction** enabled by disavowal\']{.mark}]{.underline}.\[20\] If,
for Sexton, [Moten is a repetition of that \'black\' disavowal, then
Fanon is another, displaced, repetition of Moten\'s
repetition]{.underline}.

#### The alternative fails\-\--fugitivity is a flawed method of political engagement that makes neoliberal violence inevitable.

**Love 15** -- Associate Professor at the University of Pennsylvania
\[Heather, ""Doing Being Deviant: Deviance Studies, Description, and the
Queer Ordinary," differences Vol. 26, No. 1, p. 89-91\]

Today, queer studies -- prestigious but unevenly institutionalized --
still signals absolute refusal or criticality -- all anti- and no
normativity. In their influential 2004 essay, "The University and the
Undercommons" (and in the 2013 book that followed from it), Fred [[Moten
and]{.underline}]{.mark} Stefano [[Harney]{.underline}]{.mark} rely on
such an understanding of queer (as well as concepts borrowed from black
studies, feminism, ethnic studies, and anticolonial thought). They
[[call for]{.mark} betrayal, [refusal]{.mark}]{.underline}, theft,
[[and]{.mark} [marronage]{.mark}]{.underline} as modes of resisting the
iron grip of the academy, pointing to an uncharted, underground, and
collective space they call the undercommons. "To enter this space," they
write, "is to inhabit the ruptural and enraptured disclosure of the
commons that fugitive enlightenment enacts, the criminal, matricidal,
queer, in the cistern, on the stroll of the stolen life, the life stolen
by enlightenment and stolen back, where the commons give refuge, where
the refuge gives commons" (103). Moten and Harney speculate whether the
"thought of the outside" (105) is possible inside the university and
suggest that if there is an outside, it is along the margins and at the
bottom. [[Yet **their imagination of that outside is indebted to the
inside**]{.underline}]{.mark}, in particular to the conception of
deviance produced within sociology. [Their account of the undercommons
reads like a rap sheet, a list of the traditional topics of deviance
studies: theft, homosexuality, prostitution, incarceration. [Moten and
Harney do not describe the undercommons, but]{.mark} rather [ask]{.mark}
their [readers to join it]{.mark}]{.underline}, to participate in active
revolt against profes- sional and disciplinary protocols. To o er an
objective account of the social position of radical academics would be
to further business as usual in the academy; dwelling in the
undercommons requires giving up on the usual protocols of description.
Moten and Harney argue against the traditional role of the "critical
academic" (105), which they see as just another turn of the professional
screw, since work that opposes the academy does not challenge its basic
structure or everyday operations. They argue that "to be a critical
academic in the university is to be against the university, and to be
against the university is always to recognize it and to be recognized by
it, and to institute the negligence of the internal outside, that
unassimilated underground, a negligence of it that is precisely, we must
insist, the basis of the professions" (105). In contrast to the figure
of the critical academic, they forward the image of the "subversive
intellectual" who is "in but not of" the academy (101). Without
dismissing the galvanizing effect of such a call to the undercommons,
[[it is important to **consider the limits of the refusal** of
objectification as a strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}. To be unlocatable,
to be nowhere, to be in permanent revolt: Moten and Harney describe the
path that queer inquiry laid out for itself.
[Objectification]{.underline} -- [recognition, description,
**[critique]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- [[can]{.mark} be a way to
reinforce the status quo, but it [is]{.mark} also **[a way of
acknowledging one's institutional position and the real differences
between inside and outside]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Even the most
subversive intellectuals in the academy are "on the stroll" in a
metaphorical but not a material sense. The fate of those who came "under
false pretenses, with bad documents, out of love" (101), if they
survive, is to become "superordinates" in Becker's sense. Whose side are
we on? Can we hold onto the critical and polemical energy of queer
studies as well as its radical experiments in style and thought while
acknowledging our implication in systems of power, management, and
control? Will a more explicit avowal of disciplinary affiliations and
methods snuff out the utopian energies of a field that sees itself as a
radical outsider in the university? To date, [both the political and the
methodological antinormativity]{.underline} of queer studies [have made
it difficult to address our implication in [the violence of knowledge
production]{.mark}, pedagogy, and social inequality.]{.underline}
[**Such violence [is inevitable]{.mark}**, and critical histories of the
disciplines]{.underline} -- and the production of knowledge about social
deviance -- [are essential.]{.underline} [**[Undertaking such
work]{.underline}**, [however]{.underline}, **[will not allow escape
into a radically different relation to our objects because we
are]{.underline}**]{.mark} (as Moten and Harney also argue) part of that
history -- we are **[[its contemporary
instantiation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. To imagine a social world in which
those relations are transformed -- in what Moten and Harney refer to as
the "[prophetic organization]{.underline}" (102) -- [may be crucial
for]{.underline} the achievement of [social justice, but **[to deny our
own implication in existing structures is also a form of
violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Norma Coates expresses here an ethical and aesthetic quandary we might

misogynistic work? [How can one have an aesthetic taste for something

called for the necessity for feminists to abandon mainstream cinematic
pleasure as coercive (Mulvey 1975; Lorde 1983). [I contend, however,

[what]{.mark} the [master\'s tools "do,"]{.mark} when nothing is as

[What ought I hope for? This question guides]{.underline} our [pursuit
of the good life]{.underline} and its answer is often shaped by our
social, political, and educational experiences. [We aren't born
with]{.underline} ready-made [hopes]{.underline}; rather, [we shape them
through]{.underline} our [interactions]{.underline} with others, our
growing sense of what is possible as [we learn]{.underline} about our
environment, and [our experiments with the world to see what we can do
within it and to change it]{.underline}. Other [people play an important
role]{.underline} in this process, [especially through institutions like
schools]{.underline}, social arrangements like families, and political
practices like democracy. [They shape the traditions and
expectations]{.underline} we inherit, as well as the ways in which we
test, challenge, and revise what has been passed on to us. Despite this,
[hope is too often described in [individualist terms]{.mark} that
[**fail to encapsulate** the]{.mark} full [**process** of hoping and
its]{.mark} potential [impact]{.mark} on shared living]{.underline}.
[Many **theologians** link hope with]{.underline} an individual's [faith
in a deity]{.underline} who will act on his or her behalf, 1 [some
philosophers employ a **narrow understanding** of hope as an
individual's desire for an outcome in the face of
uncertainty]{.underline}, 2 while many more psychologists describe hope
as an individual's use of willpower and "waypower" to achieve clear
goals. 3 [Instead, I]{.underline} will [offer [a **pragmatist
account**]{.mark} of hope]{.underline}, which is [firmly [rooted
in]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[experiences]{.underline}]{.mark} of
individuals [and [grows out of real]{.mark} life [circumstances]{.mark},
yet cannot be disconnected from social and political life]{.underline}.
4 I extend my account to show how [a pragmatist view of hope is
necessarily connected to other people and can]{.underline} be used to
[enrich our experiences in communities]{.underline}. Moreover, [such
hope can help us to **[better face]{.mark} current [political struggles
and social problems]{.mark}**]{.underline}, all the while building a
democratic identity together. 5 In this article, I will explain how
[pragmatism offers an enhanced understanding of hope]{.underline} and
its role in our lives together. To examine the ways in which shared
hoping and the shared content of our hopes shape our identity and our
work together in democracy, I consider both how and what we hope.
[Unlike]{.underline} other [accounts of hope that are **largely divorced
from life's circumstances**, such as **theological accounts** that
direct our attention to deities]{.underline} and psychological accounts
[that tell us we must hope for our goals regardless of real world
constraints]{.underline}, [pragmatist hope is noteworthy because it is
firmly rooted in reality]{.underline}. 6 Moreover, [[a
pragmatist]{.mark} account [addresses]{.mark}]{.underline} some of the
[current [obstacles]{.mark}]{.underline} we face [in American democracy
[and is **capable of transforming**]{.mark} **or improving**
[them]{.mark}]{.underline}. Perhaps more importantly, [such hope can be
directly and indirectly cultivated within citizens]{.underline}, thereby
[offering a feasible way that democratic life can be
strengthened]{.underline}. 1 Present Context Before looking at hope in
detail, let's briefly first take stock of current conditions that relate
to hopelessness in personal and political life. In pragmatist spirit,
the account I offer here must attend to real conditions. Unfortunately,
these are conditions where hope is struggling, where democracy may be in
jeopardy, and where the dominant form of hope that we do see is largely
privatized. To begin, a recent study using the World Values Survey and
other polling sources finds that democratic [[citizens
have]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[become]{.mark} more [cynical]{.mark} about
the value of democracy]{.underline} as a political system, [less hopeful
that anything they do might influence public policy, [and]{.mark} more
[willing to]{.mark} express **[support]{.mark} for [authoritarian
alternatives]{.mark}**]{.underline}." 7 [[Those]{.mark} citizens
[have]{.mark} increasingly [**withdrawn** from democratic
participation]{.mark}, whether that be through formal institutions or
alternatives in the public or civic spheres]{.underline}, such as
joining in movements or protests. There has been a dramatic shift in how
the wealthy view democracy, with 16 percent of them now believing that
military rule is a better way of living and an astounding 35 percent of
rich young Americans holding such a view. 8 There are likely many
factors impacting this current state of affairs and I will touch on a
few here. 9 First, in terms of hope most overtly, Alan Mittleman rightly
notes that "[the legitimacy of politics is damaged in proportion to its
failure to fulfil the hopes it has engendered]{.underline}." 10 Indeed,
several recent American candidates ran on messages of hope and yet the
visions evoked have often failed to be fulfilled in reality, crushing
the heightened expectations of citizens. [Politicians often use the
rhetoric of hope, but they tend to distort what hope really is and what
it requires of citizens]{.underline}, as I will explain later. Instead,
they make reference to the supposed destiny of the nation with God as
its backer. Or, as in the cases of Barack Obama and Donald Trump, some
citizens place their hope in the leader himself, invoking a messianic
figure. These forms of hope entail no more citizen action than, perhaps,
donating to a campaign or wearing an iconic t-shirt proclaiming "hope."
Instead, I will argue that, rather than passively relying on the hope
promised by politicians, citizens must participate in shaping and
fulfilling hope, making such hope more genuine and robust. Second,
[[structural violence]{.mark} and inequality, common amongst poor and
racial minority communities in America, [has wreaked havoc on
hope]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In some cases]{.underline}, it has eroded
hope. 11 In others [[it]{.mark} has [rendered hope
exhausting]{.mark}]{.underline}, 12 \*\*\*footnote 12 begins\*\*\*

[citizens]{.mark} are [left]{.mark} either **[nihilistically without
hope]{.mark}** or perpetually chasing a vision of justice that
is]{.underline} (perhaps sometimes intentionally kept) [out of
reach]{.underline}. 13 \*\*\*footnote 13 begins\*\*\* **[Calvin

of [hope that is]{.mark} more [**sustainable** and]{.mark} more
[**attuned** to]{.mark} the [real conditions]{.mark} of life that we can
control and others where we have limited control]{.underline}. Third,
[citizenship]{.underline} in America [has increasingly become centered
on individuals]{.underline}, personal responsibility, entrepreneurship,
and private success. [Historical accounts of rugged
individualism]{.underline} have now [joined forces with calls to educate
children in grit and expectations]{.underline} that one will fight [to
earn one's position]{.underline} and goods [in a competitive
marketplace]{.underline}. 14 [This environment lacks trust in others and
discourages collaborative effort]{.underline}. [Often [those who]{.mark}
have not been successful]{.underline} in the past, or do not see viable
avenues for being so in the future, [**[fatalistically accept]{.mark}**
these [conditions]{.mark} and [become passive]{.mark} about countering
or changing them]{.underline}. [While others who have enough resources
and power]{.underline} to be comfortable with the present conditions,
[indulge in the privilege of being cynical or apathetic]{.underline}.
[[Some spread]{.mark} these [states of hopelessness]{.mark}]{.underline}
or jaded negativity [through memes]{.underline} and messages on social
media, [especially about the role and effectiveness of government,
**[rendering cynicism a collective practice]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 15
[Cynics, left believing that their political efforts are useless or
ineffective and perhaps that everyone acts on self-interest, are left to
look out merely for themselves, without a sense of responsibility to act
on behalf of themselves and others]{.underline}. Indeed, [cynics may
mock others who do not hold such views as naïve and out of touch with
reality]{.underline}. [Cynicism functions as [a **distancing maneuver**,
separating citizens from]{.mark} each other, from formal [democratic
institutions]{.mark}, and from civic organizations, where visions of an
improved world and action to achieve it tend to occur]{.underline}. [My
notion of hope aims to span those divides]{.underline}. Finally, [what
is left of hope has become **privatized**]{.underline}. 16 [This is
exacerbated as neoliberalism]{.underline} continues to assert Margaret
[Thatcher's claims, "There is no such thing as society, only individuals
and families," and "there is no alternative to the market."]{.underline}
[Hope is reduced to a mere drive to achieve one's own limited
dreams]{.underline}, or those of one's children, typically only through
financial terms and material goods. When citizens are rendered isolated
competitors, [[they lose]{.mark} the [**ability to detect social
problems** and]{.mark} the [**motivation to ameliorate them**,
especially if]{.mark} the [effects]{.mark} on one's self]{.underline} or
family [[are not immediate]{.underline}]{.mark}. Economist Tyler Cowen
describes these citizens as [the new "complacent class,"]{.underline}
who are [content]{.underline} with the way things are as long as they
are not directly harmed and as long [as they can stay surrounded by
people and things that confirm their experience of the
world]{.underline}. In their complacency, the members of the complacent
class are unable to "inspire an electorate with any kind of strong
positive visions, other than some marginal adjustments." 17 I aim to
show how hope is better understand as a social and political endeavor
that brings us into contact with others as we craft visions of the
future. In sum, [these changes in citizens' lives and views **debilitate
individual citizens and democracy as a whole**]{.underline}. [They keep
us from recognizing and solving collective problems and from leading
better lives together]{.underline}. Citizens sit around waiting for
reasons to hope, sometimes becoming swept up in campaign rhetoric when
election cycles come around, rather than acknowledging that [hope is
generated through action as subjects working together]{.underline}, as I
will argue. I will turn now to depict a [pragmatist]{.underline} account
of [hope]{.underline} that [can be]{.underline} formally [cultivated in
schools and]{.underline} informally in [our lives
together]{.underline}---a way of hoping together [that may better
support democratic life in these challenging times]{.underline}. 2
Pragmatist Hope I offer here a pragmatist account of hope, largely based
in the philosophy of John Dewey. Notably, Dewey himself does not provide
such an account, even though hope underlies much of his work and was
evident in his own personal life as he encountered considerable despair
at the loss of two of his children and his wife, while also facing two
world wars. I construct a view of hope from Dewey's well-articulated
elements of inquiry, growth, truth, meliorism, and habits.
[[Pragmatism]{.mark} begins with the real and complicated conditions of
our world]{.underline}. [It [brings together intelligent reflection with
inquiry, habits, and action]{.mark} so that we can understand and change
our environments to better align with our needs and
desires]{.underline}. [Hope plays an important role in that
process]{.underline}. Inquiry, Growth, and Truth For Dewey,
[hope]{.underline} often [arises within the midst of despair, when we
have lost our way and are struggling to move forward]{.underline}.
[Dewey describes these moments as "indeterminate
situations."]{.underline} He turns to the process of inquiry via the
empirical method to help us explore those situations, consider possible
courses of action, and test out various solutions. It is inquiry that
helps us to understand, act upon, and reconstruct our environments and
our experiences so that we are able to move forward out of the
indeterminate situation. In a richly cognitive and often social
practice, [inquiry invokes curiosity and [problem solving to move us out
of ruts]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [[this]{.mark} method
**[combats]{.mark} the [stagnation of fatalism]{.mark}** [by urging us
to **formulate and try out solutions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Growth
describes how reconstructions of our experiences through [inquiry
develops]{.mark} physical, [intellectual, and moral capacities]{.mark},
actualizing them and helping them inform one another so that
[they]{.mark} continue in a chain that [enables one to **live
satisfactorily**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [We **grow** when we learn from
inquiry into indeterminate situations and **create ways to re-establish
smooth living** that carries us from one activity to the
next]{.underline}. [[Many]{.mark} people **[wrongly assume]{.mark}**
that [growth]{.mark}]{.underline} necessarily [[has an
**end**]{.underline}]{.mark}---as if it were "movement toward a fixed
goal." 18 We tend to think of growth as only progression toward some
specific outcome, such as mastering bicycle riding or graduating from
high school. [But this way of thinking tends to place the emphasis on
the static terminus, [**rather** than focusing on the
**process**]{.mark} of growing [as **itself educative** ]{.mark}**and
worthwhile**]{.underline}. [Dewey's alternative view]{.underline} of
growth [does not neatly and linearly move toward a fixed
goal]{.underline}. [Instead,]{.underline} he describes
[[trajectories]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[are]{.mark} more
[complicated]{.mark}]{.underline}, often [shifting with the
environment]{.underline}. Moreover, [holding onto a fixed goal may be
undesirable because doing so employs a limited or possibly foreclosed
vision of the future]{.underline}. Instead, [as changes occur in one's
environment]{.underline}, Dewey asserts that [people must continually
inquire into moments of uncertainty and changing circumstances, develop
new hypotheses about those situations, and revise their
aims]{.underline}. Dewey works with what he calls ["ends-in-view," which
are relatively close and feasible, even if difficult to achieve, rather
than overarching goals at some final endpoint in the
future]{.underline}. Those ends-in-view guide our decisions and
hypotheses along the way, [keeping us resourceful in the
present]{.underline}. In Dewey's words, the discovery of how things do
occur makes it possible to conceive of their happening at will, and
gives us a start on selecting and combining the conditions, the means,
[to command their happening]{.underline}...[there must be a realistic
study of actual conditions and the mode or law of natural
event]{.underline}, in order [to give the imagined or ideal object
definite form and solid substance]{.underline}---to give it, in short,
[practicality and constitute it as a working end]{.underline}. 19 For
Dewey, [[ends and means]{.mark} are intelligently [considered in **light
of each other**]{.mark}, with [both]{.mark} being
**[revisable]{.mark}**, and [neither **abstracted**]{.mark} from the
other]{.underline}. [Each fulfilled end-in-view sustains our hope by
highlighting meaningful headway and directing our further
action]{.underline}. [Ends-in-view later become means to future ends,
working in an ongoing continuum]{.underline}. [[This]{.mark}
**sustenance of hope** [differs from theological accounts which are
**difficult to sustain**]{.mark} on faith alone [and]{.mark} may [leave
believers **frustrated**]{.mark} at an apparent lack of action or
improvement]{.underline}. It also differs from positive psychology and
grit literature which tends to focus on large, far-off, and challenging
goals that one holds tenaciously. [Many people think of hope as
goal-directed and future-oriented]{.underline}. [While objects of hope
for pragmatists may temporarily serve as ends-in-view, the practice of
hope moves us forward through inquiry and experimentation as we pursue
our complicated trajectory]{.underline}. [It helps to unify our past,
present, and future]{.underline}. [[Hope]{.underline}]{.mark}, then, [is
[not]{.mark} just about a vision of the future, but rather a way of
living in the present that is informed by the past and what is
anticipated to come]{.underline}. [[Whereas utopian views]{.mark} of
what could be [may]{.mark} actually immobilize one and may [exhaust
one]{.mark} in the present, **[pragmatist hope is always tied to what
one is]{.mark} doing [and feasibly can do]{.mark} in the present**,
especially when equipped with knowledge of the past]{.underline}.
Central to pragmatist philosophy, [ideas become true insofar as they
"work" for us, fruitfully combine our experiences, and lead us to
further experiences that satisfy our needs]{.underline}. [Pragmatists
are concerned with the concrete differences in our lived experiences
that an idea's being true will make]{.underline}. [Pragmatic truth
expresses "the successful completing of a worthwhile
leading."]{.underline} 20 Unlike truth as a corresponding match between
proposition and reality, [pragmatist truth]{.underline} is something
that [occurs when the goals of human flourishing are
satisfied]{.underline}, at least temporarily. Built into these criteria
is consideration of the well-being of others, for successful leading
through experiences almost always necessarily requires working and
communicating with others. Additionally, the differences an idea will
make are quite limited, and therefore less truthful, if relevant only to
one person. While not a comprehensive vision of the good life, [certain
norms including equality and just communication are entailed both in
these deliberations and the determination of truth]{.underline}. 21 We
must consider how to flourish alongside others as we craft our
ends-in-view. This differs considerably from other philosophical and
psychological accounts of hope based on the desire of objects or states
of affairs regardless of whether they are good for us or other people.
Meliorism Pragmatists like Dewey recognize the difficulty of present
circumstances, yet approach them practically, rather than
idealistically, with thoughtful action, believing that circumstances can
be improved. 22 Unlike simple optimists, however, they do not hold that
the situation will necessarily work out for the best, but rather they
believe people should make efforts to contribute to better outcomes.
Such efforts are rarely undertaken alone, instead they are tied to
others who are working together to solve problems. In the words of
contemporary pragmatist Cornel West, "Optimism adopts the role of the
spectator who surveys the evidence in order to infer that things are
going to get better. Yet when we know that the evidence does not look
good...Hope enacts the stance of the participant who actively struggles
against the evidence." 23 Meliorism entails action in the face of
difficulties. [Dewey sees hope as a way of living aligned with
meliorism, "the idea that at least there is a sufficient basis of
goodness in life and its conditions so that by thought and earnest
effort we may constantly make better things."]{.underline} 24 [Meliorism
is **[not]{.mark} a [belief in inevitable progress]{.mark}**,
[but]{.mark} rather [a call to]{.mark} human [action]{.mark}, especially
[in the midst of]{.mark} struggle and [uncertainty]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Dewey firmly argued that [it would be foolish to believe that there is
"an automatic and wholesale progress in human affairs,"]{.underline}
insisting instead that [[betterment "depends upon
**deliberative**]{.mark} **human [foresight]{.mark}** [and **socially
constructive work**]{.mark}."]{.underline} 25 Martin Luther King, a
champion and practitioner of hope, was enshrined on the floor of Obama's
oval office with his phrase: "The arc of the moral universe is long, but
it bends toward justice." Importantly, given how many hopes fell flat
under the messianic figure of Obama, King later explained in a
pragmatist spirit of meliorism, "[Human [progress]{.mark} never rolls on
wheels of inevitability; it [comes through]{.mark} the **[tireless
efforts]{.mark}**]{.underline} of men willing to be co-workers with God,
and [[without]{.mark} this [hard work, time]{.mark} itself [becomes an
ally of]{.mark} the forces of [social stagnation]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[We must **use time creatively**, in the knowledge that the time is
always ripe to do right]{.underline}." 26 We cannot wait until we have a
clear picture of our final future goals; rather, [we must act now in
intelligent ways and through inquiry to bring about better conditions
and, thereby,]{.underline} truth. [27 And we must be flexible to change
and redirect our efforts as they unfold]{.underline}. [[Meliorism is an
**alternative to**]{.mark} **both [pessimism and
optimism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[It cultivates **hope**, **growth**,
and **better worlds**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For some pragmatists, like
Colin Koopman, this meliorism-based hope is "[the pragmatist affect par
excellence]{.underline}: '[hope is the **mood of
meliorism**]{.underline}' (27), '[the characteristic attitude of
pragmatism is hope']{.underline} (17)." 28

### AT: Law Bad 

#### Law is not innately anti-black

Amna **Akbar 18**, Assistant Professor, Moritz College of Law, 7/25/18,
"Toward a Radical Imagination of Law," Public Law and Legal Theory
Working Paper Series No. 426

Around the same time, I had begun teaching a law and social movements
seminar. We studied the Black Panthers and Young Lords, Len Holt, Assata
Shakur, and Ella Baker. I worried my students found the questions faced
by these movements to be abstract and faraway. I wanted them to
understand that contemporary movements struggled with questions similar
to those in the texts we labored over. That's how an organizer found
himself surrounded by future lawyers. Hayes, along with his comrades in
the contemporary [[Black liberation]{.mark} and immigrant justice
[movements, **confronted**]{.mark} many of the same **[strategic and
tactical choices every day.]{.mark}**]{.underline} As I had hoped, his
presence transformed our conversation. Our intellectual distance from
the texts vanished, and our lively conversation ended with a question:
What is the proper role of lawyers within the movement? After a short
pause, Hayes praised the technical chops and procedural expertise
lawyers bring to the table. But that is not enough, he said. ["Most
lawyers see a problem and think, **'How can I fix this law?**'" This
view is **too narrow:** it obscures the stakes and **concedes to status
quo arrangements.** "The role of the law is to protect the state," Hayes
reasoned. "**[Lawyers must work with movements to imagine]{.mark} with
us [the kind of state we want to live in.]{.mark}** Only from there can
we work together to think about the laws we need."2]{.underline} In
conversations with intellectuals and organizers around the country, I
realized the Movement for Black Lives (**[[M4BL]{.underline}]{.mark}**
or Movement)3---the larger movement configuration in which the chapter
based Black Lives Matter network functions---[was having a far richer
and more imaginative conversation about law reform than lawyers and law
faculty. The Movement for Black Lives was situating their critique in
**Black history** and intellectual traditions, and their **imagination
of alternate futures** in Black freedom movements. Their critique was
more expansive at the same time as it was more grounded, and their
imagination more radical.4 Legal scholars often assume the movement's
fight is over policing: indictments for police killings,]{.underline}
independent prosecutors to investigate police shootings, better training
and supervision for police, more diverse police forces, and so on.5
[But, as Hayes suggested, the most imaginative voices within
contemporary racial justice movements are fighting for much more than
body cameras and police convictions.6 The movement [is focused on
shifting power into Black]{.mark} and other marginalized
[communities]{.mark};7 **[shrinking the space of governance]{.mark} now
[reserved for]{.mark}policing, [surveillance, and mass
incarceration;]{.mark}** and **fundamentally [transforming]{.mark}** the
[relationship among state]{.mark}, market, [and society]{.mark}.8
[Movement actors]{.mark} have [**made policy proposals** and **engaged
in law reform**]{.mark} campaigns [**at the same time** they]{.mark}
have prominently [contested]{.mark} law and [politics as
usual]{.mark}.]{.underline}9 In the few years after Ferguson police
officer Darren Wilson's killing of Michael Brown, there were shutdowns
of bridges and highways; die-ins at courthouses and statehouses;
occupations of police stations, police unions, and universities; arrests
and curfews; tear gas and riot gear.10 But the movement's highprofile
campaigns have not been waged by lawyers or via litigation.11 Indeed,
[the movement has largely refrained from fighting to strengthen
preexisting rights or demanding legal recognition of new ones.12 The
focus is not on investing even-handedness to law or the police, not on
restoring criminal justice to some imaginary constitutional or pre-raced
status quo, and not on increasing resources for community policing.13
But it would be wrong to think the movement has given up on
law.]{.underline} [[The movement is]{.mark} not [attempting to]{.mark}
operate outside of law, but rather to **reimagine** its possibilities
within a broader attempt to [**reimagine the state.** Law is fundamental
to what movement actors are fighting **against** and
**for**]{.mark}.]{.underline}14 To illustrate how the movement approach
reorients traditional criminal law reform conversations, I examine the
2016 policy platform of the Movement for Black Lives, "A Vision for
Black Lives: Policy Demands for Black Power, Freedom, and Justice" (the
Vision).15 I put the Vision in conversation with the Ferguson and
Baltimore reports by the Department of Justice16---which represent more
traditional liberal approaches to criminal law reform. The Vision and
the DOJ reports offer some of the most damning critiques of policing in
recent memory, but differ fundamentally in their analysis and
conclusions. The contrast reflects the limitations of liberal law reform
at the same time that [it opens up a more imaginative set of
possibilities about reorganizing the very structure of our
society.]{.underline} By studying the convergences and divergences
between these texts, this Article highlights how radical social
movements reimagine the very same social problems with which significant
bodies of legal scholarship engage. The Vision and DOJ reports offer
alternate conceptualizations of the problem of policing and the
appropriate approach to law reform. [Reflective of liberal law reform
projects on police, the DOJ reports identify policing as a fundamental
tool of law and order that serves the collective interests of society,
and locate the problems of police in a failure to adhere to
constitutional law.]{.underline} As a corrective, the DOJ reports
advocate for investing more resources in police: more trainings, better
supervision, community policing. In contrast, [the Vision identifies
policing as a historical and violent force in Black communities,
underpinning a system of racial capitalism and limiting the
possibilities of Black life. As such, policing as we now know it cannot
be fixed.]{.underline} Thus, the Vision's reimagination of
policing---rooted in Black history and Black intellectual
traditions---transforms mainstream approaches to reform. [In forwarding
a decarceral agenda rooted in an abolitionist imagination, the Vision
demands shrinking the large footprint of policing, surveillance, and
incarceration, and shifting resources into social programs in Black
communities: housing, health care, jobs, and schools. The Vision focuses
on building power in Black communities, and fundamentally transforming
the relationships among state, market, and society. In so doing, the
movement offers transformative, affirmative visions for change designed
to address the structures of inequality]{.underline}---something legal
scholarship has lacked for far too long. The DOJ reports document the
problems endemic to policing. While presenting a critical view of
Ferguson's and Baltimore's police departments, the reports are committed
to the legal status quo, to a mode of governance that relies on criminal
law enforcement to deal with a broad set of deep-seated social problems,
and to rules and authorities that are historically and functionally
oppressive. As a result, the reports double down on traditional reforms
that reinvest in law and police.17 This approach cedes more
legitimacy---not to mention more resources---to the police and the legal
frameworks in which they operate without a meaningful consideration of
alternatives. Of course, the reports emerge from a particular time and
social location: a prosecutorial agency, the Civil Rights Division,
embedded within the executive branch during the Obama administration.18
As with any social location, there are possibilities, pressures, and
constraints on what the DOJ may say or do as a law enforcement agency
under a particular administration. But framed in a different
understanding, accountable to different constituencies, the DOJ could
have taken an approach to reform more aligned with the Vision,
suggesting a realignment of resources from policing to the underlying
social problems stemming from structural inequality in Ferguson and
Baltimore. The additional importance of the DOJ reports lies in how they
reflect how legal institutions---and, in turn, law scholarship---
approach long-standing structural problems while firmly committed to the
status quo and restoring legitimacy thereto. In this way, the DOJ
reports expose a central dilemma of liberal law reform projects, caught
between a commitment to the rule of law and status quo arrangements on
the one hand, and the desire for substantive justice and social,
economic, and political transformation on the other.19 But [our
political moment is defined by crisis and polarization, with
insurgencies on the left and right calling for reform, transformation,
and even revolution.20 [Amid]{.mark} the electoral [triumph of
Trump,]{.mark} protest and **[people-of-color-led anti-capitalist
movements]{.mark}** have [surged]{.mark} in activity.21 These radical
movements mark the revival of anti-capitalist racial justice politics in
the United States [in a way]{.mark} that [we have not seen since]{.mark}
the civil rights, [**Black power**, and **Chicano movements**]{.mark} of
the 1960s and 1970s. Contemporary racial justice [movements]{.mark} are
not simply arguing the state has created a fundamentally unequal
criminal legal system. They are [identifying]{.mark} [policing]{.mark},
jail, and prison **[as the primary mode of governing]{.mark}** Black,
poor, and other communities of color in the United States,]{.underline}
and pointing to law as the scaffolding. [[They]{.mark} are
[work]{.mark}ing [to build]{.mark} another state---**[another

can ignore their deep critiques and visionary alternatives, or we can
embrace the possibilities of a more searching inquiry. **This is a
moment calling for a radical imagination,**where the scale of deep
critique is matched with **a scale of grand vision**.22]{.underline}
While many progressive and left legal scholars reach for meaningful
change, most of us lack alternative frameworks.23 Like the DOJ reports,
even when the scale of our critique is large, our visions for change are
often too small. We have focused on a narrow picture of law and law
reform while sidestepping questions about the structure of the society,
the state, and the market. These movements make these questions central
to their work.24 They do not have it all worked out. But they are making
powerful sketches of much-needed alternative frameworks. [**[Imagining

[invest]{.mark} **law [scholarship]{.mark}** [in a **project of

racial justice movements, the primary commitment is not to law, its
legitimacy, rationality, or stability: It is to people.26 [The

[The problem with **[addressing a problem in terms of bad
faith]{.mark}** is that its [exemplars would **immediately seek to
defend themselves**. Bad faith]{.mark}]{.underline}, as many who have
studied the phenomenon know, [is **ashamed of itself** and thus
**[attempts to hide from itself]{.mark}** often [through **shifting the
orientation of critique**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Gordon, 1995/1999;
Sartre, 1943). Thus, the defense is on the alert for analyses of bad
faith to be in bad faith. Much of this has to do with the negative
associations of the word 'bad' and the legalistic meaning of 'bad faith'
in the English language. Thus, I prefer simply to use the French term
mauvaise-foi. Mauvaise-foi has its negative connotations in French, but
its range is broader in usage than in English, just as Geist in German
doesn't exactly mean 'spirit' or 'mind' as it is often translated into
English. The aforementioned list of hegemonic theorists of the study of
race and gender in the mid-1990s reflects the domination of three
approaches: (1) poststructuralism, (2) Marxism, and (3) liberal
political theory primarily in the form of analytical political
philosophy. Existentialism and phenomenology were not only being treated
as passé but also as incompatible with each other. There was also the
problem of 'compartmentalism' and 'disciplinary decadence', two
tendencies that continue to be features of not only much race theory but
also most disciplinary practices in the academy. The former offered
disciplines under a separate but equal rule, which, if history has
taught us anything about such formulations, is never actually so. The
latter sought methodological conquest. These constrained what one could
talk about when it came to human matters and how one is supposed to do
it. I eventually developed a formulation of the second: 'methodological
fetishism' (Gordon, 2016). Poststructuralism, Marxism, and analytical
philosophy in the form of liberal political philosophy exemplified this
tendency. One could add continental philosophy to this, which was in
fact another way of saying 'Euro-continental philosophy'. It, however,
became, and for the most part continues to be, dominated by
poststructualism and, relatedly, hermeneutics or theories of
interpretation. [A form of **cart before the horse** was the result,
where **[fetishized methods]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[were being
**imposed on reality** instead of **constructing relationships with
it**]{.underline}]{.mark}. As should be apparent at this point,
disciplinary decadence is a form of mauvaise-foi (Gordon, 2006, 2012,
2016). The similarity to Sartre's famous formulation of [the fallacy of
**[placing essence before existence]{.mark}** in the study of human
reality also **comes to the fore**]{.underline} (Sartre, 1943, 1946).
This is particularly ironic with regard to poststructuralism since its
approach is patently anti-essentialist (Caws, 1992; Gordon, 2012).
Mauvaise-foi emerged not only at the level of human phenomena in action
but also at the ways in which they are studied. For instance, [the
compartmentalist approach of [**separating race away** from other
dimensions of human reality **distorts the subject at hand**]{.mark}. It
could only be done]{.underline}, ultimately, [in **mauvaise-foi**
because of [the **imposition of non-relationality** on a **relational
subject**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Gordon, 2010, 2016). [The old debate of
race versus gender]{.underline}, or race [versus class]{.underline}, or
gender versus class, and any of these [versus sexual orientation is a
**fine intellectual exercise under laboratory conditions** in which the
**domain of inquiry is staked out** and **constrained**]{.underline}.
That, however, is not human reality. Typically, [[we]{.mark} (human
beings) [don't '**see**' **race**, **gender**, **class**, or **sexual
orientation**]{.mark} **walking around**; [we **exemplify**]{.mark},
**coextensively**, [**all of these**, **all the time**, in **different
ways**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Imagine the hyphenated version
class-gender-race-sexuality (and more) with emphasis on different words
at different times. Focus is not identical with elimination.
[[Race]{.underline}]{.mark} for me, then, [was]{.underline} and
[continues to be studied **in relation to what made it**, among **other
related phenomena**, **[emerge as a reality]{.mark}** of human life
[over the **past several hundred years**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Gordon,
1995/1999, 1995, 2006, 2010). There is a simple version of my argument
from those years: [[Racism **requires denying the humanity of other
groups**]{.mark} of human beings through the **organization of them**,
[through **regimes of power**]{.mark}, under the **category of a race**
[and then **denying the ascription of human being to
them**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The performative contradiction is
that]{.underline} [[they would **first have to be identified as human
beings**]{.mark} in order to deny their being such.]{.underline} It is
thus a form of mauvaise-foi. Since racism is a form of mauvaise-foi,
antiblack racism, as a species of racism, must also be a form of
mauvaise-foi. My seemingly simple argument had complicated theoretical
consequences. [How did such performative contradictions historically
emerge? [People **were not always categorized under
races**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [**Gender** and **linguistic membership
predated many racial concepts**]{.underline} (Gordon, 1997). [Many other
examples, such as **religious membership**, **location in an economy**,
and even **specialized skills** could be **added to the
mix**.]{.underline} One approach is to look at [the [concepts informing
dehumanization]{.mark}]{.underline}. They [[**depend** on a **particular
idea of human beings** at work]{.mark} in racist practices]{.underline}.
[An **obvious feature of racism** is the **rejection of having
relationships** with members of certain races]{.underline}.
Non-relationality has many implications. For one, [[the **notion that
one could exist without relations with others**]{.mark} (a slippery
slope leading to being without relations) [**requires a model of the
self** as self-sustaining 'substance'. That]{.mark} model [has
**dominated**]{.mark} **much of**]{.underline} market-oriented
**[[Euromodern thought]{.underline}]{.mark}**, especially those in the
Anglophone world. My writings could be read as a critique of this
notion. Consider any act of studying a phenomenon. Such an effort cannot
be done without establishing at least a relationship with something as a
focus of study. This doesn't involve eliminating one's relationship to
reality but instead reorienting oneself to relevant acts of knowing,
learning, and understanding (Gordon, 1995, 2010, 2012, 2016).
[[Commitment to the elimination of relations **leads to
contradictions**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Try, for instance, eliminating
relations to oneself. Mauvaise foi returns in many forms as each
displeasing truth about relations is denied for the sake of pleasing
falsehoods. In the chain of efforts, other [[**important elements** of
study such as **communicability**, **evidence**, and **sociality** come
to the fore]{.underline}]{.mark}, each of which raises concerns of the
self as other. As I focused primarily on antiblack racism, the question
of whether all other forms of racism are the same emerged. Blackness
functions, after all, in peculiar ways in societies that have produced
antiblack racism. A response to the #BlackLivesMatter movement, for
instance, is often that 'all lives matter'. That is true the extent to
which each group lives under conditions of equal respect for life. What
advocates of #BlackLivesMatter are doing, however, is responding to a
world in which some lives matter a lot more than others, whose lives
evidentially matter a lot less. The history of antiblack racism amounts
to the conviction that black people are only valuable the extent to
which there is use for their labor or, worse, profiting from their
misfortune as we see with the heavily racialized prison industrial
complexes in the United States and similar countries (Alexander, 2010;
Davis, 1983, 2005). It collapses into the expectation of justified
existence in a context in which the justification for whoever stands as
most valued is intrinsic. Members of the dominant group could thus seek
their justification -- if they wish -- personally, through mechanisms of
love, professional recognition, athletic achievement, etc. Moreover,
that such society renders some groups as positive and others as negative
leads to notions of legitimate presence (illegitimate absence) and
absence (illegitimate presence). [[Should the analysis **remain at white
and black**, the world would]{.mark}, however, **[appear more closed
than it]{.mark} in fact [is]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For one, [**simply
being born black** would **bar the possibility** of **any legitimate
appearance**. This is a position that has been taken by]{.underline} a
growing group of theorists known as ['**Afropessimists**']{.underline},
[for whom 'black' signifies absolute '**social death**']{.underline}
(Sexton, 2010, 2011; Wilderson, 2007, 2008, 2009). [It is]{.underline},
in other words, **[outside of relations]{.underline}**. My objections to
this view are many. For one, [[no human being is '**really**' **any of
these things**]{.mark}. Do blacks]{.underline}, for instance, [**suffer
social death in relation to each other**? [The **project** of **making
people into such** is **one thing**. The **achievement** of such is
**another**]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is an observation Fanon also
makes in his formulation of the zone of nonbeing and his critique of
otherness in the study of race in Black Skin, White Masks, which I
discuss at length my (Gordon, 2015) study, What Fanon Said: A
Philosophical Introduction to His Life and Thought. Fanon (1952) is
critical of how otherness is interpreted in race theories and the study
of race. The rejection of otherness ignores the fact that others are
human beings. Racism emerges in attempts to deny that. Instead, it
offers the zone of nonbeing, non-appearance as human beings. The
racially dominant group presumes self-justified reality (license), which
means it doesn't call itself into question. And the designated racially
inferior group? Lacking justification, their access to being is
illegitimate. This means their absence is a mark of the system's
legitimacy. Such groups face the Catch 22 of illegitimate appearance: To
appear is to violate appearance. Put differently, the violation is one
of appearing without a license to do such. To all this, a consideration
that should be added is this: The human being comes to the fore through
emerging from being in the first place. Thus, the assertion of Being, as
in the thought of Heidegger and his followers is also an effort to push
the human being out of existence, so to speak. Heidegger, fair enough in
his 'Letter on Humanism' (1947/1971), saw no problem in this. Fanon
(1952), and many others in Africana philosophy, including the South
African philosopher and psychologist Noël Chabani Manganyi (1973, 1977),
disagreed through showing how racial conflict is also an existential one
in which an existential ontology is posed against an ontology of being.
The latter, we submit, is best suited for gods. When such becomes the
model of being human, humanity dies. Blacks thus face the paradox of
existing (standing out, living -- as ex sistere means such) as
non-existence (not standing out). Antiblack racism makes black
appearance illicit. Licit appearance would mean appearing as selves and
others. It would mean the right to appear. [Antiracist struggles **will
not work**]{.underline}, then, [as a **struggle against otherness**. It
is]{.underline}, instead, [**against being non-selves** and
**non-others**]{.underline}. [Returning to the Afropessmistic notion of
**blackness as social death**]{.underline}, I'm compelled to ask: [Why
must the social world be **premised on the attitudes** and
**perspectives of antiblack racists**? Why don't blacks among each other
and other communities of color **count as social perspectives**? [If the
question of racism is a **function of unequal power**]{.mark}, which it
**clearly is**, [why not offer a **study of power**]{.mark}, how it is
**gained** and **lost**, [**instead of an assertion** of its
manifestations as **ontological**]{.mark}?]{.underline} I'm reminded
here of Victor Anderson's (1995) Beyond Ontological Blackness. Anderson
would no doubt object that [[Afropessimism treats 'blackness' as an
**ontological**, which makes it a **self-sustaining**]{.mark}
(**non-relational**) [**concept**. The historical emergence of blackness
**refutes that**]{.mark}]{.underline}. But more, [[there is a **logical
paradox** that]{.mark} emerges from ontological blackness. [To identify
blackness, one **must be in a relation to it**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
This relational matter requires looking beyond blackness ironically in
order to understand blackness. This means moving from the conception of
meaning as singular, substance-based, and fixed into the grammar of how
meaning is produced. Consider the grammar of gender. Women historically
occupy the role of absence (de Beauvoir, 1949; Butler, 2011; Gordon,
1995/1999, 1997). Blackness and womanness are thus intimate (Gordon,
1995/1999, 1997). The grammar of presence and absence is peculiarly
theodicean (Gordon, 2010, 2013). This is the form of mauvaise-foi in
which presence takes on the hubris of the desire to be a (often the)
god. Theodicy defends the integrity of the god (systemic maintenance)
through placing its contradictions (for example, evil) outside of it.
The result is Being as a form of systemic purity (Monahan, 2011, 2017).
This grammar is also psychoanalytical, in the sense of existential
psychoanalysis. Manichean 'qualities' (such as 'hard' masculinity and
'soft' femininity) are evident in these modes of being. This pertains as
well to sexual orientation: A white man's relation to a black man is not
only one of race-to-race but also of race-to-gender where the meaning of
being black (as 'feminine' and 'sexual') could collapse into gendered
absence. And extended to the sexualization of absence -- think of the
plethora of literature on the feminine as soft, cold, dark, and absence.
The relation among males in which one group manifests such qualities
immediately collapses into a homoerotic one (Fanon, 1952; Gordon,
1995/1999, 1997, 2000). We see here a conception of dealing with racial
and gender qualities that are today called 'intersectional', though that
metaphor doesn't at first quite work for their existential
phenomenological psychoanalytical manifestations in mauvaise-foi
(because purity seeks singularity). The major proponent of
intersectionality -- Kimberlé Crenshaw -- is pretty clear that she is
referring to identity collisions as they appear in law (especially tort
and discrimination law); in other words, she is referring to harms that,
because of how they are interpreted, don't appear (supposedly don't
exist) despite their lived-reality. She often illustrates her point
through her famous example of a collision at a four-way intersection
(Crenshaw, 1991, 2014). If the fundamental site of harm is property, the
concern will be about the cars, and if their status of property depends
on being owned by, say, white men, then harm would pertain to them. If
the location of harm expands simply to 'whites', then a white woman or
man in one of the cars would be sufficient for harm having occurred. If,
however, there were no whites in the cars, then the conclusion would be
that no one was harmed. If harm extends to blacks and other people of
color, and even further, to non-human animals, then any of them being in
the car or cars would initiate a cause for redress. Notice that
Crenshaw's argument doesn't deny the possibility of white men being
harmed. Her point is that people such as black women were not
historically acknowledged in the legal frameworks of harmed subjects
because of a failure to see that human beings do not manifest a single
category of identity on which to build a legal response. Simply
referring to 'man' as the exemplar of human being fails to acknowledge
that human beings are not only men but also women, and simply as 'women'
fails to address what kind of women such as those of color and different
sexual orientations. At an existential level, what is also missed is the
lived-reality of the convergence of these and their social and legal
implications. A black woman in an automobile collision is, for example,
not just harmed but also harmed in ways linked to the wider legal
framework of the society. The criminalization of black women and men,
for instance, could mean that though harmed in the collision, such
people may face the possibility of entanglement in a legal system that
treats them as the cause of harm, which could lead to other dangers such
as ensnarement in the criminal justice system. This is one of the
reasons why, even when harmed, many people of color don't seek the aid
of law enforcement and other representatives of that system. Crenshaw's
theory therefore has an existential and phenomenological significance in
that it is an argument for the appearance of what is otherwise treated
as either non-existent or not worthy of appearing, of, that is, illicit
appearance. Her theory is also about the radicalization of appearance in
that the identified subjects emerge, so to speak, not only in terms of
being seen but also through an effort to see what they see or experience
-- in short, to see or at least understand their point of view in terms
of the conditions they face. It is thus not a subjective theory or a
narrowly objective one but instead an intersubjective theory because it
requires understanding how different human beings relate to and
encounter legal structures -- products of the human world -- as
simultaneously alienating and enabling. Crenshaw's concept of an
intersection could, however, be interpreted in problematic ways. The
first is the geometric model of an intersection. That version
presupposes well-formed or complete lines converging. A response would
be that there was never a complete 'whole' or, as the feminist
phenomenological communicologist Sara Ahmed (2006) would put it,
'straight line' with regard to human subjects in the first place. The
queer phenomenological theorist David Ross Fryer (2008), in stream with
Ahmed, offers the logical conclusion of this critique -- namely, a
fundamental queerness at the heart of race theory and related areas of
study such as gender studies and queer theory. My recent work in
philosophy of culture extends such a concern to the human condition as
well -- that is, the upsurge from being makes human reality a queer one.
This is pretty much the argument articulated earlier with regard to
questions raised by Fanon's analysis of ontology, existential ontology,
and the dialectics of selves and others. The second critical
consideration is that [as all human beings are **manifestations of
different dimensions of meaning**, [the question of identity requires
**more than**]{.mark}]{.underline} an intersecting model, otherwise
there will [simply]{.underline} be [one (**[a priori]{.mark}**)
**normative [outcome]{.mark}** [in **every moment of
inquiry**]{.mark}:]{.underline} Whoever manifests the maximum
manifestation of predetermined negative intersecting terms. That would
in effect be an essence before an existence -- indeed, before an actual
event of harm. Some [[race theorists' tendency to build their
arguments]{.mark} on a particular group [as 'most oppressed' **without
offering evidence for the continued truth of such a claim**]{.mark} is
an example of this fallacy. This observation **[emerges]{.mark} as well
[where pessimism is the guiding attitude]{.mark}**.]{.underline} An
existential critique would be that [optimism and pessimism are
**symptomatic of the same attitude**: **a priori assertions on
reality**. [Human existence is **contingent but not accidental**, which
means that the social world at hand is a **manifestation of choices**
and **relationships**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- in other words, [**human
actions**. As [human beings **can only build the future instead of it
determining us**]{.mark}, the task at hand **depends on commitment** --
what is to be done **without guarantees of outcome**]{.underline}. This
concern also pertains to the initial concerns about authenticity. [[One
**could only be pessimistic** about an **outcome**]{.mark},]{.underline}
an activity. It's an act of forecasting what could only be meaningful
once actually performed. Similarly, one could only be optimistic about
the same. What, however, if there were no way to know either? Here we
come to the foi element in mauvaise foi. Some actions are deontological,
and if not that, they are at least reflections of our commitments, our
projects. Thus, [[the point of some actions **isn't about their
success** or **failure** but **whether we deem them worth
doing**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Fanon, 1961/ 1991; Gordon, 2015).
[**[Taking responsibility]{.mark}** for such actions]{.underline} --
bringing value to them -- [[is **opposed to**]{.underline}]{.mark}
another manifestation of **[[mauvaise-foi]{.underline}]{.mark}**: the
spirit of seriousness.

#### Their theory defers questions of praxis and agency and historical resistance\-\--the history of black resistance proves that even imperfect actions create the conditions to dismantle antiblack political formations

The first is that [[''**an** antiblack world'' is **not identical** with
''**the** world is antiblack.'']{.underline}]{.mark} My argument is that
[[such]{.mark} a world [is a]{.mark}n antiblack racist
**[project]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [It is [**not** the]{.mark}
historical [achievement]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Its limitations emerge
from a basic fact: [Black people]{.mark} and other opponents of such a
project [**fought**, and **continue to fight**]{.mark}, as we
see]{.underline} today [in]{.underline} the
[#B]{.underline}lack[L]{.underline}ives[M]{.underline}atter movement
[and many others]{.underline}, against it. [The same]{.underline}
argument [applies to]{.underline} the argument about [[social
death]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Such an achievement [would have
**rendered**]{.mark} **even these [reflections
stillborn]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark} basic [premises]{.mark}
of the Afropessimistic argument [are]{.mark}]{.underline}, then,
[[locked in **performative contradictions**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Yet,
they have rhetorical force. This is evident through the continued growth
of its proponents and forums (such as this one) devoted to it. In Bad
Faith and Antiblack Racism, I argued that there are forms of antiblack
racism offered under the guise of love, though I was writing about
whites who exoticize blacks while offering themselves as white sources
of black value. Analyzed in terms of bad faith, where one lies to
oneself in an attempt to flee displeasing truths for pleasing
falsehoods, exoticists romanticize blacks while affirming white
normativity, and thus themselves, as principals of reality. These
ironic, [performative contradictions are features of all forms of
racism, where one group is elevated to godlike status and another is
pushed below that of human despite both claiming to be
human]{.underline}. Antiblack racism offers whites self-other relations
(necessary for ethics) with each other but not so for groups forced in a
''zone of nonbeing'' below them. There is asymmetry where whites stand
as others who look downward to those who are not their others or their
analogues. [Antiblack racism is thus not a problem of blacks being
''others.'']{.underline} [It's a problem of their
not-being-analogical-selves-and-not-even being-others]{.underline}.
[Fanon]{.underline}, in Black Skin, White Masks (1952), [reminds us that
[Blacks **among each other** live in a world of selves and
others]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It is in attempted relations with whites
that these problems occur]{.underline}. Reason in such contexts has a
bad habit of walking out when Blacks enter. What are Blacks to do? As
reason cannot be forced, because that would be ''violence,'' they must
ironically reason reasonably with forms of unreasonable reason.
Contradictions loom. [Racism is]{.underline}, given these arguments, [a
**project** of imposing non-relations as the model of dealing with
people designated ''black.'']{.underline} In Les Damne´ de la terre
(''Damned of the Earth''), [Fanon]{.underline} goes further and [argues
that [colonialism]{.mark} is an attempt to [impose a Manichean
structure]{.mark} of contraries [instead of]{.mark} a
**[dialectical]{.mark}** one of ongoing, human negotiation of
contradictions]{.underline}. [The former segregates the groups; the
latter emerges from interaction]{.underline}. The police, he observes,
are the mediator in such a situation, as their role is force/violence
instead of the human, discursive one of politics and civility (Fanon,
1991). Such societies draw legitimacy from Black non-existence or
invisibility. Black appearance, in other words, would be a violation of
those systems. Think of the continued blight of police, extra-judicial
killings of Blacks in those countries. An immediate observation of many
postcolonies is that antiblack attitudes, practices, and institutions
aren't exclusively white. Black antiblack dispositions make this clear.
Black antiblackness entails Black exoticism. Where this exists, Blacks
simultaneously receive Black love alongside Black rejection of agency.
Many problems follow. [The [absence of agency bars]{.mark} maturation,
which would reinforce the racial logic of Blacks as in effect wards of
whites]{.underline}. [Without agency, [ethics, liberation]{.mark},
maturation, [politics, and responsibility]{.mark} could not be
possible]{.underline}. [[Afropessimism faces]{.mark} the problem of [a
**hidden premise** of white agency versus Black
incapacity]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Proponents]{.mark} of Afropessimism
would no doubt [respond]{.mark} that [the theory]{.mark} itself
[is]{.mark} a form of [agency]{.mark}]{.underline} reminiscent of
Fanon's famous remark that though whites created le Negre it was les
Negres who created Negritude. [Whites clearly did not create
Afropessimism, which Black liberationists should celebrate]{.underline}.
[We should [avoid the **fallacy**]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, [of
[confusing source with outcome]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[History is not
short of **bad ideas from good people**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [If
intrinsically good]{.underline}, however, [each person of African
descent would become ethically and epistemologically a switching of the
Manichean contraries, which means only changing players instead of the
game]{.underline}. []{.mark}We come, then, to the crux of the matter.
[If the goal of Afropessimism is Afropessimism, its achievement would be
**attitudinal** and, in the language of old, stoic -- in short, a
**symptom** of antiblack society]{.underline}. At this point, there are
several observations that follow. The first is a diagnosis of the
implications of Afropessimism as symptom. The second examines the
epistemological implications of Afropessimism. The third is whether a
disposition counts as a political act and, if so, is it sufficient for
its avowed aims. There are more, but for the sake of brevity, I'll
simply focus on these. [An ironic dimension of [pessimism]{.mark} is
that it [is the **other side** of optimism]{.mark}]{.underline}. Oddly
enough, [[both are]{.mark} connected to
**[nihilism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which is, as Nietzsche (1968)
showed, a decline of values during periods of social decay. [It emerges
when [people **no longer want to be responsible** for]{.mark} their
[actions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Optimists expect intervention from
beyond. Pessimists declare relief is not forthcoming. Neither takes
responsibility for what is valued. The valuing, however, is what leads
to the second, epistemic point. [The presumption that what is at stake
is what can be known to determine what can be done is the
problem]{.underline}. [If such knowledge were possible, the debate would
be about who is reading the evidence correctly]{.underline}. [Such
judgment would be a priori -- that is, **[prior to events actually
unfolding]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The future]{.mark}, **unlike**
transcendental conditions such as language, signs, and reality,
[is]{.mark}, however, ex post facto: It is **[yet to
come]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Facing the future, the question **isn't**
what will be or how do we know what will be but instead the realization
that whatever **is done** will be that on which the future will
depend]{.underline}. [Rejecting optimism and pessimism, there is a
supervening alternative: **political commitment**]{.underline}. The
appeal to [political commitment]{.underline} is not only in stream with
what French existentialists call l'intellectuel engage´ (committed
intellectual) but also [reaches back through the history and existential
situation of enslaved, racialized ancestors]{.underline}. [Many were,
[in]{.mark} truth, an existential paradox: **[commitment to action
without guarantees]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The [slave revolts, micro
and macro acts of resistance, escapes, and returns]{.mark} help others
do the same]{.underline}; the cultivated instability of plantations and
other forms of enslavement, and countless other actions, were waged
against a gauntlet of forces designed to eliminate any hope of success.
The claim of colonialists and enslavers was that the future belonged to
them, not to the enslaved and the indigenous. A result of more than 500
years of conquest and 300 years of enslavement was also a (white)
rewriting of history in which African and First Nations' agency was, at
least at the level of scholarship, nearly erased. Yet there was
resistance even in that realm, as Africana and First Nation intellectual
history and scholarship attest. [Such actions [**set the course**
for]{.mark} **different kinds of [struggle today]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Such reflections occasion meditations on the concept of failure.
[[Afropessimism]{.underline}]{.mark}, the existential critique suggests,
[[suffers from]{.mark} a **[failure to understand
failure]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Consider Fanon's notion of
**constructive failure**, where [what doesn't initially work
**transforms conditions** for something new]{.mark} to
emerge]{.underline}. To understand this argument, one must rethink the
philosophical anthropology at the heart of a specific line of Euromodern
thought on what it means to be human. Atomistic and
individual-substance-based, this model, articulated by Hobbes, Locke,
and many others, is of a non-relational being that thinks, acts, and
moves along a course in which continued movement depends on not
colliding with others. Under that model, the human being is a thing that
enters a system that facilitates or obstructs its movement. [An
alternative model, shared by many groups across southern Africa, is [a
relational]{.mark} version of the [human]{.mark} being as part of a
larger system of meaning]{.underline}. [Actions]{.underline}, from that
perspective, [are not about whether ''I'' succeed but instead about
''our'' story across time]{.underline}. [As relational, it means that
each human being is [a **constant negotiation** of **ongoing efforts**
to build relationships]{.mark} with others, which means [no one]{.mark}
actually [enters a situation without]{.mark} establishing new situations
of action and meaning]{.underline}. Instead of entering a game, their
participation requires a different kind of project -- especially where
the ''game'' was premised on their exclusion. Thus, [where the
system]{.underline} or game [repels initial participation,
such]{.underline} repulsion [is [a **shift in**]{.mark} **the
[grammar]{.mark}**]{.underline} of how the system functions, especially
its dependence on obsequious subjects. [Shifted energy affords
**emergence of alternatives**]{.underline}. [[Kinds **cannot be known
before**]{.mark} **the [actions]{.mark}** that birthed
them]{.underline}. [Abstract as this sounds, it has much historical
support]{.underline}. Evelyn [Simien]{.underline} (2016), in her
insightful political study Historic Firsts, [examines the new set of
relations established by]{.underline} Shirley [Chisholm's
and]{.underline} Jesse [Jackson's presidential campaigns]{.underline}.
[There could be no]{.underline} Barack [Obama without such important
predecessors affecting the demographics of voter
participation]{.underline}. Simien intentionally focused on the most
mainstream example of political life to illustrate this point. [Although
no exemplar of radicalism, Obama's ''success'' emerged from Chisholm and
Jackson's]{.underline} (and many others') [so-called
''failure.'']{.underline} Beyond presidential electoral politics, [there
are numerous examples of how prior, [radical]{.mark} so-called
[''failures'' **transformed relationships** that facilitated other kinds
of outcome]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The trail goes back to [the Haitian
Revolution]{.mark} and back to every act of resistance from Nat
[Turner's Rebellion]{.mark}]{.underline} in the USA, [[Sharpe's]{.mark}
in Jamaica, [or Tula's]{.mark} in Curacao and so many other efforts for
**social transformation to come**]{.underline}. In existential terms,
then, [many ancestors of the African diaspora embodied]{.underline} what
Søren Kierkegaard (1983) calls [an existential paradox]{.underline}.
[All the evidence around them suggested failure and the futility of
hope]{.underline}. [They first had to make a movement of infinite
resignation]{.underline} -- that is, resigning themselves to their
situation. [Yet they must simultaneously act against that
situation]{.underline}. Kierkegaard called this seemingly contradictory
phenomenon ''faith,'' but that concept relates more to a relationship
with a transcendent, absolute being, which could only be established by
a ''leap,'' as there are no mediations or bridge. [Ironically, if
[Afropessimism]{.mark} appeals to transcendent intervention, it [would
**collapse into faith**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [If, however, the argument
rejects transcendent intervention and focuses on committed political
action, of taking responsibility for a future that offers no guarantees,
then the movement from infinite resignation becomes existential
**political action**]{.underline}. [At this point, the **crucial
meditation** would be on **politics and political action**]{.underline}.
[An attitude of [infinite resignation]{.mark} to the world
**[without]{.mark} the leap of [committed action]{.mark}** [would
**simply be**]{.mark} **pessimistic or
[nihilistic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Similarly, [an attitude of hope or
optimism about the future would lack infinite resignation]{.underline}.
[We see here the underlying failure of the two approaches]{.underline}.
[Yet ironically, there is [a]{.mark} form of **[failure at
failing]{.mark}** in the pessimistic turn versus the optimistic one,
since if focused exclusively on resignation as the goal, then the
''act'' of resignation would have been achieved, which,
**paradoxically**, would be a success; it would be a **successful
failing of failure**]{.underline}. [For politics to emerge]{.underline},
however, [there are two missing elements in inward pessimistic
resignation]{.underline} The first is that [[politics is]{.mark} a
[social]{.mark} phenomenon, which means it requires the expanding
options of a social world]{.underline}. [[Turning away]{.mark} from the
social world, **[though a statement]{.mark}** about politics, [is
**not**]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, [in and of itself
[political]{.mark}]{.underline}. The ancients from whom much western
political theory or philosophy claimed affinity had a disparaging term
for individuals who resigned themselves from political life: idiotes, [a
private person, one not concerned with public affairs, in a word -- an
idiot]{.underline}. I mention western political theory because that is
the hegemonic intellectual context of Afropessimism. We don't, however,
have to end our etymological journey in ancient Greek. Extending our
linguistic archaeology back a few thousand years, we could examine the
Middle Kingdom Egyptian word idi (deaf). The presumption, later taken on
by the ancient Athenians and Macedonians, was that a lack of hearing
entailed isolation, at least in terms of audio speech. The [contemporary
inward [resignation of seeking]{.mark} a form of **[purity]{.mark}**
from the loathsome historical reality of racial oppression]{.underline},
in this reading, [**[collapses]{.mark} ultimately [into]{.mark} a form
of [moralism]{.mark}** (private, normative satisfaction) [instead of
**public responsibility**]{.mark} born of and borne [by
**action**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The second is the importance of
power]{.underline}. [Politics makes no sense without it]{.underline}.
But what is power? Eurocentric etymology points to the Latin word potis
as its source, from which came the word ''potent'' as in an omnipotent
god. If we again look back further, we will notice the Middle Kingdom
(2000 BCE--1700 BCE) KMT/ Egyptian word pHty, which refers to godlike
strength. Yet for those ancient Northeast Africans, even the gods'
abilities came from a source: In the Coffin Texts, HqAw or heka
activates the ka (sometimes translated as soul, spirit, or, in a word
''magic''), which makes reality. [All this amounts to a straightforward
thesis on power as the ability with the means to make things
happen]{.underline}. [There is an **alchemical quality** to
power]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark} human [world]{.mark}, premised on
symbolic communication, [brings **many forms of meaning** into
being]{.mark}, and [those]{.mark} new meanings [afford relationships
that **build institutions**]{.mark} through a world of
culture]{.underline}, a phenomenon that Freud (1989) rightly described
as ''a prosthetic god.'' It is godlike because it addresses what
humanity historically sought from the gods: protection from the
elements, physical maledictions, and social forms of misery. [Such power
clearly can be abused]{.underline}. [It is where those enabling
capacities (empowerment) are pushed to the wayside in the hording of
social resources into propping up some people as gods that the
legitimating practices of cultural cum political institutions decline
and stimulate pessimism and nihilism]{.underline}. [That institutions in
the Americas very rarely attempt establishing positive relations to
Blacks is the subtext of Afropessimism]{.underline} and this entire
meditation. [The discussion points]{.underline}, however, [to a demand
for political commitment]{.underline}. Politics itself emerges under
different names throughout the history of our species, but the one
occasioning the word ''politics'' is from the Greek polis, which refers
to ancient Hellenic city-states. It identifies specific kinds of
activities conducted inside the city-state, where order necessitated the
resolution of conflicts through rules of discourse the violation of
which could lead to (civil) war, a breaking down of relations
appropriate for ''outsiders.'' [Returning to the Fanonian observation of
selves and others, it is clear that imposed limitations on certain
groups amounts to impeding or blocking the option of
politics]{.underline}. [Yet, as a problem occurring within the polity,
the problem short of war becomes a political one]{.underline}. Returning
to Afropessimistic challenges, the question becomes this: [If the
problem of antiblack racism is conceded as political, where antiblack
institutions of power have, as their project, the impeding of Black
power, which in effect requires barring Black access to political
institutions, then antiblack societies are ultimately threats also to
politics defined as the human negotiation of the expansion of human
capabilities or more to the point: freedom]{.underline}. [Anti-politics
is one of the reasons why societies in which antiblack racism is
hegemonic are]{.underline} also [those in which racial moralizing
dominates: [moralizing stops]{.mark} at individuals [at]{.mark} the
**[expense of addressing institutions]{.mark}** the transformation of
[which would **make immoral individuals
irrelevant**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [As a political problem, [it
**demands a political solution**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It [is not
accidental that Blacks continue to be the continued exemplars of
unrealized freedom]{.underline}. [As so many from]{.underline} Ida B.
[Wells-Barnett to]{.underline} Angela [Davis]{.underline} (2003)
[and]{.underline} Michelle [Alexander]{.underline} (2010) [have shown,
the expansion of privatization and incarceration is squarely placed in a
structure of states and civil societies premised on the limitations of
freedom (Blacks) -- ironically, as seen in countries such as South
Africa and the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates,
[in the name of freedom]{.underline}. [That [**power** is]{.mark} a
facilitating or enabling phenomenon, a functional element [of
the]{.mark} human [world]{.mark}, a viable response must be the
**establishing of relations** that reach **beyond the singularity of the
body**]{.underline}. [I bring this up because proponents of
Afropessimism might object to this analysis because of its appeal to a
human world]{.underline}. [If that world is abrogated, the site of
struggle becomes that which is patently not human]{.underline}. [It is
**not accidental** that popular race discourse refers today to ''black
bodies,'']{.underline} for instance, [instead of ''black
people.'']{.underline} [As the human world is discursive, social, and
relational, this abandonment amounts to an appeal to the non-relational,
the **incommunicability** of singularity, and appeals to the body and
its reach]{.underline}. [At that point, it's perhaps the]{.underline}
psychologist, psychiatrist, or [psychoanalyst who would be helpful, as
turning radically inward offers the promise of **despair**, narcissistic
delusions of godliness, and, as Fanon]{.underline} also [observed,
madness]{.underline}. [Even if that **slippery slope** were rejected,
[the **performative contradiction** of attempting to communicate]{.mark}
such singularity or [absence]{.mark} thereof [requires]{.mark}, at least
[for **consistency**]{.mark}, the appropriate course of action:
**[silence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark} remaining
[question]{.mark} for Afropessimism]{.underline}, especially those who
are primarily academics, [[becomes]{.mark} this: **[Why
write?]{.mark}**]{.underline} [It's a question for which, in both
existential and political terms, [I don't see]{.mark} how [an
answer]{.mark} could be given from an Afropessimistic perspective
[without]{.mark} the **unfortunate revelation of
[cynicism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The **marketability**]{.mark} of
Afropessimism [is]{.mark} no doubt [in the]{.mark} immediate and
**[paradoxical satisfaction in dissatisfaction]{.mark}** it
offers]{.underline}. [We are at this point on familiar
terrain]{.underline}. [[As with]{.mark} ancient logical [paradoxes
denying]{.mark} the viability of [time]{.mark} and motion, [the **best
option**]{.mark}, after a moment of immobilized reflection, [is]{.mark},
eventually, [to **move on**]{.mark}, even where the pause is itself
significant as an encomium of thought]{.underline}.

#### Experimentation is uniquely good to combat anti-black violence\-\--a history of struggle proves its effectiveness that can depart from the status quo and create material change

He asserts that "man as a total problem" -- "the possibility of the
total" and "truly human man" -- can only be "posed and resolved on the
level of everyday life."57 Challenging the kind of critique or revolt
promoted by "mystics and metaphysicians," he proposed a dialectical
approach that would overcome false oppositions between "everyday life
and festival -- mass moments and exceptional moments . . . seriousness
and play -- reality and dreams."58 According to Lefebvre, [everyday
life]{.underline}, especially in cities, [becomes the scene of a
**certain utopianism** which **combines imaginative vision with
experimental practices** in order to identify and pursue what he called
the "possible-impossible."]{.underline}59 [At once **future-oriented**
and **now-centered**, **aesthetic** and **political**, a **serious
strategy** and an **end in itself**]{.underline}, such everyday
practices contribute to what a more human "art of living."60 [We
might]{.underline} also [call this an **art of anticipation** in which
visionary thinking and experimental acts come together in a type of
"**play acting**" that "**explores what is possible**."]{.underline}61
In the late 1950s, Lefebvre further developed this thinking about lived
utopianism. Under modern capitalist conditions, he explains, previous
modes of envisioning a truly human form of life (whether based on
fantasies of natural living or classical antiquity) had either been lost
or discredited as fictive or mythical, but new ones had not taken their
place. Far from celebrating this development, he regarded it as tragic
that the postwar Left had no myth of "the new life" and spoke only in
the language of industrial rationalism, technocratic planning, and
productivist acceleration.62 But Lefebvre also argued that in the new
era of postwar planning there was a resurgence of utopian thinking
because "the advanced countries are lagging behind their own
possibilities" and are "less able to satisfy those who ought to be happy
with it."63 He writes, "[Utopianism]{.underline} lives again . . . It
[is **exploring the possibilities of praxis**]{.underline} . . .
Imagination is adopting or rediscovering a creative power. It is pooling
forces with an obscurely rediscovered spontaneity."64 And, "[If we are
to **build a revitalized life**]{.underline} . . . [[we must **use
utopian method experimentally**]{.mark}, looking ahead to **what is
possible** and **what is impossible** [and **transforming this**]{.mark}
**hypothetical exploration [into]{.mark} applicable programs** and
**[practical plans]{.mark}**."]{.underline}65 Lefebvre called this
orientation a "philosophy of the possible" which attends to "relations
with the real and the here-and-now" in order to discover "the opening,
by which \[we\] may enter in a practical way into the
'possible-impossible' dialectic."66 Lefebvre's call in the late 1950s
for a new "revolutionary romanticism" seemed to receive an uncanny
answer in what he regarded as "the irruption" of May '68. For him this
unforeseen event "broke into" everyday life even as everyday practices
constituted that which was revolutionary about the event.67 For
Lefebvre, May '68 was neither an unmediated presentist eruption nor the
working out of a blueprint for the future. He writes, "A theory of the
movement has to emerge from the movement itself, for it is the movement
that has revealed, unleashed, and liberated theoretical capacities."68
His analysis of '68 emphasizes spontaneous popular contestation and mass
participation, the commitment to transform society as a whole and create
new forms of life, and above all the emergence of experiments in
self-management which were at once concrete and utopian, practical and
performative, actual and prefigurative, political and cultural. For
Lefebvre, this "irruption" demonstrated that "everyday existence" cannot
be "transcended in one leap" but only through "the process of
self-management."69 He characterized it as an "unthinkable movement"
that nevertheless "actually existed" and therefore allowed and compelled
people to "think the unthinkable."70 Not surprisingly, he called May '68
a "concrete utopia."71 The dialectic movement between utopian
imagination and experimental practice allowed May '68 to make real a
supposedly impossible form of life in the "anticipated urban society."72
He writes, "The specifically utopian function of cultural contestation
will thus supersede itself by fulfilling itself in practice."73 This
kind of collective anticipation through concrete utopian experiments in
self-management comes through clearly in Kristin Ross's insightful
analysis of the Paris Commune. Ross writes: More important than any laws
the Communards were able to enact was simply the way in which their
daily workings inverted entrenched hierarchies and divisions . . . The
world is divided between those who can and those who cannot afford the
luxury of playing with words or images. When that division is overcome,
as it was under the Commune . . . what matters more than any images
conveyed, laws passed, or institutions founded are the capacities set in
motion.74 If social relations are to be radically transformed, Ross
suggests, it will not be by teaching people how to be citizens of a
future society, but by mobilizing such capacities, which are at once
practical and theoretical, political and aesthetic, actual and
potential.75 In a similar spirit Massimiliano Tomba examines the
"insurgent universality" that was practiced and performed by the more
radical and subaltern forces within the French Revolution. He writes,
this insurgency not only interrupted the continuum of a specific
historical configuration of power, but . . . disclosed and anticipated
new political pathways, which indicated alternative trajectories beyond
political modernity. These pathways were molten in the red-hot magma of
many experiments, abandoned or repressed. The experiment was the
virtuous "skidding off course (dérapage)" of the Revolution during which
slaves, women and the poor gained voice and acted as if they were
citizens.76 More recently, [we might [consider]{.mark} the category
confounding character of [the]{.mark} **1979 [Iranian
Revolution]{.mark}** and the everyday practices of "horizontalism"
following [the]{.mark} **2001 financial [crisis in Argentina]{.mark}**,
in **recent [Occupy]{.mark} struggles**, and **autonomous popular
movements worldwide**. Concrete utopian anticipation has assumed more
robust forms in [the **Zapatista experiment**]{.mark}]{.underline} in
Chiapas, Mexico [[and the]{.mark} ongoing **[Kurdish
experiment]{.mark}**]{.underline} in Rojava, Syria. 5. Reconstruction,
Transfiguration, Improvisation These brief examples should make clear
that [the politics of [anticipation]{.mark} are **not only symbolic**
and **performative**. An anticipatory dialectic of prefiguration and
transfiguration]{.underline} -- or the circular relation among
envisioning, enacting, and realizing -- [[has been]{.mark} **especially
well [developed]{.mark}** [within the **black radical
tradition**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consider, for example, [W.E.B. Du
Bois's plan]{.underline} during the early 1930s [to
organize]{.underline} African Americans into **[self-managing consumer
cooperatives]{.underline}**. He [took as his staring points the
**refractory character of the color line** (which proved to be
**invulnerable to rational refutation** or **legal
challenges**)]{.underline}, the mutually reinforcing relation between
racism and poverty, the white supremacy of the American labor movement,
and the devastating effect of the Great Depression on the black
community. Given this historical condition, [Du Bois sought to
**identify immanent possibilities within alienated forms** by turning
the fact of segregation into a **source of social strength** and
**political education**]{.underline}. He argued that [[if **planned**
and **organized**, **existing**]{.mark} networks of [black
sociality]{.mark} and exchange [could **ground a new**]{.mark} **form of
[solidarity]{.mark}** and **autonomy** through which [to
**confront**]{.mark} **capitalism** and
**[racism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. He believed that self-managing
cooperatives organized around mutualist lines could create opportunities
for work without exploitation, production without profit, exchange
without stratification, knowledge production without exclusion -- in
ways that would reinforce bonds across different social sectors of the
black community.77 On one level, Du Bois's multi-faceted program was a
pragmatic response to an immediate predicament. [These consumer
cooperatives would **create a basis for economic survival**]{.underline}
under conditions of Jim Crow segregation during the Depression. [By
doing so **without depending on either state aid** (that **might not
come**) or **legal reform** (that **might not matter**), it was also
meant to **transform formal liberty into substantive
freedom**]{.underline}. Du Bois emphasized that [these]{.underline}
economic [efforts were meant to **complement**, and **help to realize**,
**rather than replace** the existing civil rights struggle]{.underline}.
He offered a strategy for achieving full citizenship from a position of
economic security, strength, and leverage. [But Du Bois's call for
economic self-management was also [a **concrete utopian project**
]{.mark}**to radically reconstruct American democracy by abolishing the
color line** and **overcoming capitalist social
relations**]{.underline}. In his view, [these self-managing cooperatives
would [allow black actors to **develop**]{.mark} **alternative forms of
labor**, **exchange**, and **sociality** -- the **[new
subjectivities]{.mark}**, **everyday [practices]{.mark}**, **ethical
relations**, [and]{.mark} **spiritual/cultural [orientations]{.mark}**
[that would]{.mark}: 1. [**prepare themselves** for the]{.mark} future
[order they desired]{.mark}, 2. [model]{.mark} (to themselves and
others) **[what was possible]{.mark}** and **what that future might
entail** (through **experimental practices**), 3. [help to **hasten that
future**]{.mark} by **enacting it here** and **now** ([to **materialize
it by envisioning it**]{.mark}, and to **come to see it [through
material practices]{.mark}**)]{.underline}. With this plan for strategic
self-segregation, [Du Bois **was not calling for blacks to withdraw from
American society**. He was recognizing that their involuntary status as
a nation-within-a-nation offered them an **opportunity** (and
**perspective**) to **lead the nation as a whole** (beginning with the
white working class) on a **different path beyond the color line** and
towards **socialist democracy**]{.underline}. His program was based on
the conviction that racial domination could never be overcome under
capitalist conditions and that socialism could never be realized until
the color line was abolished.78 [It envisioned self-managing black
communities **playing a vanguard role** in a process whereby a whole
range of cooperative movements among different communities would form,
federate, and help to create a new "cooperative commonwealth" in and
beyond America. It thereby anticipated both a multi-racial socialist
democracy within America and a new order of international solidarity
among self-managing peoples of color against global
imperialism.]{.underline} In this way, Du Bois believed that [the [black
freedom struggle]{.mark} could **realize American democracy**,
**empower** and **[unite colonized peoples]{.mark}**, **redeem the
West**, [and **emancipate humanity** -- through **concrete everyday
practices**]{.mark} that anticipated]{.underline}, in all of these ways,
[a seemingly impossible future **already made plausible by present
conditions** and **glimpsed through the subaltern's privileged critical
insight**]{.underline}. On the one hand, [his plan was a **revolutionary
rejection of liberal progress**. It insisted that **no change would come
automatically** and that real emancipation would not be possible by
**merely adjusting the existing framework**. On the other hand, this was
a **program for radical transformation** that **refused the fantasy of
sudden revolutionary rupture**]{.underline}. Du Bois was mindful of the
long black Atlantic history during which each emancipatory break enabled
a new forms of domination. He suggested that [the process of subjective
and objective transformation that he was proposing might take
**decades**, or even **generations**]{.underline}. It was this long view
that helps explain why Du Bois developed this plan during the period
when he was writing Black Reconstruction in America, and vice versa. In
his 1935 masterwork, Du Bois demonstrates how black slaves interrupted
the historical continuum through a "general strike" whereby they fled
plantations and withdrew their labor power from the Confederate war
effort. He famously recounts how freed slaves experienced emancipation
as an apocalyptic rupture. But, as importantly, he demonstrates how an
alliance of freed blacks, Southern white workers, and Northern abolition
democrats (black and white) was briefly able to leverage the Freedman's
Bureau to open the possibility for an experiment in non-racial socialist
democracy that, in challenging the very basis of capitalist private
property and American social divisions, far exceeded the intentions of
the U.S. government and Northern interests who had supported its
creation. Much of his study is devoted to describing the revolutionary
attempt to reconstruct the very bases of American democracy through
experimental practices made possible by a contingent set of conditions
that created a unique historical situation which was seized by an
alliance of actors who anticipated -- envisioned, performed, pursued --
an alternative future in their everyday acts. This nexus of vision,
conjuncture, and practices, he suggests, positioned freed blacks to be
the vanguard of a socialist revolution and truly democratic society that
might have been. But Du Bois explains how this revolutionary "Southern
Experiment" was ultimately foreclosed by white working class racism.
When white workers allied with the planter class against freed blacks,
Northern capital was allowed to destroy the prospect of real democracy
(and racial equality) in America and across the imperialist world. Du
Bois demonstrates how this process allowed slave emancipation to evolve
into a regime of legal segregation and social stigmatization -- the very
regime into which Du Bois was born and against which he spent his life
in militant struggle. Du Bois's interwar plan for self-managing black
cooperatives can thus be read as an untimely attempt to pursue the
unrealized promise of the post-Civil War Southern Experiment. In the
1930s Du Bois sought to revitalize the unrealized 1870s project to
reconstruct American democracy on multi-racial and socialist lines.79
[The anticipatory character]{.underline} of Du Bois's account of
Reconstruction and his program for cooperative self-management [may be
situated in [a **long history of black Atlantic concrete utopianism**
which combined visionary projects with **experimental
practices**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Here [we might think of **maroon**
communities throughout the New World slave system, Toussaint
**Louverture's** 1801 black republic, and the emergence of]{.underline}
what Laurent Dubois, following Jean Casimir, called [the
"**counter-plantation**" system in post-revolutionary
Haiti]{.underline}. Thomas Holt describes how [a similar movement for
peasant self-sufficiency immediately followed the emancipation of slaves
in 19th century Jamaica]{.underline}. As I have argued elsewhere, [Aimé
**Césaire's** and Léopold **Senghor's** constitutional struggle to
transform imperial France]{.underline} into a postnational democratic
federation [may be located in this tradition]{.underline} of
anticipatory politics. [But so too can]{.underline} Frantz [Fanon's
account of]{.underline} the new forms of life that emerged through the
lived experience of [revolutionary struggle for **Algerian
independence** and]{.underline} Patrice [**Lumumba's** untimely
experiment]{.underline} in popular democracy [in the Congo]{.underline}.
[In each of these anticipatory initiatives, we can
recognize]{.underline} what Paul Gilroy has called the dialectic of
fulfillment and transfiguration. In The Black Atlantic, Gilroy describes
[a pragmatic "**politics of fulfillment**" whose "normative content
focuses attention on]{.underline} . . . [the notion that a future
society will be able to **realize the social** and **political promise**
that present society has left unaccomplished."]{.underline}80 [Gilroy
distinguishes this orientation from a utopian "**politics of
transfiguration**" that strives "continually to **move beyond the
grasp** of the merely linguistic, textual, and discursive]{.underline}.
. . [This politics exists on a lower frequency, where it is played,
danced, and acted, as well as sung and sung about, because
words]{.underline} . . [. **will never be enough**]{.underline} to
communicate its unsayable claims to truth."81 Gilroy treats black
musical expression as an especially rich locus and medium for such
utopian acts. Gilroy argues that [this]{.underline} "tradition of
expression" ["**refuses to accept** that the political is a **readily
separable domain**. Its basic desire is to **conjure up** and **enact**
the new [modes of]{.mark}]{.underline} friendship, happiness, and
[[solidarity]{.mark} that are [**consequent** on]{.mark} the
**[overcoming]{.mark}** of the [racial
oppression]{.mark}."]{.underline}82 He suggests that [these two modes of
politics [are **not mutually exclusive**]{.mark}]{.underline}; within
the black Atlantic tradition [they [have **long**]{.mark} **co-existed**
and **[complemented each other]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [But if the
politics of fulfillment has generated a black "counter-discourse"
through which to make political claims]{.underline}, Gilroy argues, [the
politics of transfiguration constitutes a "counterculture of modernity"
that seeks to expand the very domain and meaning of politics
itself]{.underline} -- partly by linking it to ethics and aesthetics,
imaginative practice and cultural performance, embodied practices and
lived memories.83 I would like to underscore the anticipatory dimensions
this politics of trasnsfiguration, which conjures and enacts new ways of
being and relating. According to Gilroy, it emphasizes the emergence of
qualitatively new desires, social relations, and modes of association
within the racial community of interpretation and resistance and between
that group and its erstwhile oppressors. It points specifically to the
formation of a community of needs and solidarity which is magically made
audible in the music itself and palpable in the social relations of its
cultural utility and reproduction.84 These transfigurative practices
create new continuities among politics, ethics, and aesthetics; Gilroy
speaks of "grounded ethics" and "grounded esthetics.85 Gilroy thus
describes a set of concrete utopian practices that anticipate (by
enacting in both form and content) an alternative good life. He writes,
progress from the status of slaves to the status of citizens led
\[western blacks\] to enquire into what the best possible forms of
social and political existence might be. The memory of slavery, actively
preserved as a living intellectual resource in their expressive
political culture, helped them to generate a new set of answers to this
enquiry. They had to fight -- often through their spirituality -- to
hold on to the unity of ethics and politics sundered from each other by
modernity's insistence that the true, the good, and the beautiful had
distinct origins and belong to different domains of knowledge.86 This
path from broken present to utopian future, by way of living memory and
embodied performance, resonates with the ways that Benjamin conjugated
remembrance and rupture. It is indeed likely that Gilroy had both
Benjamin and Adorno in mind when he writes, The history and utility of
black music. . . enable us to trace something of the means through which
the unity of ethics and politics has been reproduced as a form of folk
knowledge. This subculture often appears to be the intuitive expression
of some racial essence but is in fact an elementary historical
acquisition produced from the viscera of an alternative body of cultural
and political expression that considers the world critically from the
point of view of its emancipatory transformation. In the future, it will
become a place which is capable of satisfying the (redefined) needs of
human beings that will emerge once the violence -- epistemic and
concrete -- of racial typology is at an end. Reason is thus reunited
with the happiness and freedom of individuals and the reign of justice
within the collectivity.87 Gilroy affirms that this political
orientation converges with Marxism, even if the convergence is also
undercut by the simple fact that in the critical thought of blacks in
the West, social self-creation through labour is not the centre-piece of
emancipatory hopes. For the descendants of slaves, work signifies only
servitude, misery, and subordination. Artistic expression, expanded
beyond recognition from the grudging gifts offered by the masters as a
token substitute for freedom from bondage, therefore becomes the means
towards both individual self-fashioning and communal liberation. Poiesis
and politics begin to coexist in novel forms \[-- autobiographical
writing, special and uniquely creative ways of manipulating spoken
language, and, above all, the music.\]88 The important point here is not
the extent of Gilroy's Marxism or the accuracy of his interpretation of
Western Marxist desires regarding labor, but that he is describing a
tradition of concrete utopianism through which a future good life is
anticipated (envisioned, enacted, conjured ) through experimental
practices that are at once political, ethical, and aesthetic.89 Gilroy
writes eloquently about an "ethics of antiphony" and "the tactics of
sound developed as a form of black metacommunication."90 His attention
to music and performance as black radicalism's privileged media, and to
utopian enactment or untimely anticipation as central features of black
aesthetics, has been extensively elaborated by Fred Moten. Referring to
blackness as "the extended movement of a specific upheaval, an ongoing
irruption that annaranges every line," Moten links this upheaval and
irruption to (an ethics, politics, and aesthetics) of "the cut" and "the
break."91 Moten uses this multivalent term to index variously the gap
between (as well as the elevated conjunction of): sound and words, music
and text, poetry and philosophy, phenomenology and semiotics, experience
and expression, scream and message, being and knowing, description and
explanation, performance and analysis, showing and naming,
deconstruction and reconstruction, objectivity and subjectivity, body
and spirit, substance and sign, violence and joy, absence and abundance,
visibility and invisibility, tragedy and elegy, singularity and
totality, emotion and structure, spontaneity and preparedness,
individuality and collectivity, event and process, situatedness and
ongoinginess, return and birth, origin and repetition, past and future.
It is through this cut, by lingering in this break -- at once
existential, epistemological, and temporal -- that the (radical) work
and play of "improvisation," in and through and for what he calls
"ensemble," unfolds. This is a dazzling intervention on blackness and/as
improvisation in the break where form mirrors content, or each reworks
the other, in every instant. Among the many ramifying images that Moten
offers is that of improvisation as the performance of an "old new
language -- tragic, hopeful, fallen" that registers "the fantasy of what
hadn't happened yet" and works "to activate the foresight that is not
prophecy but description . . . embodied and silently sounded in the
music's knowing echo of shriek and prayer."92 Descriptive foresight (in
an old-new language) of what has not yet happened wonderfully expresses
the peculiar political logic of anticipation that I have been trying to
outline. Moten explains how this improvisational practice links vision,
performance, and action. He relates blackness (and critique) to the
practice of "lingering" in the "shattering tremble of the improvising
ensemble's music . . . Not in the interest of an understanding or
adequate representation of the action whose performance would occur in
this lingering, but in the interest of an enactive invocation, a
material prayer, the dissemination of the conditions of possibility of .
. . action."93 In short, Moten conjures a space and practice of
imaginative performance and embodied desire that is at once aesthetic,
ethical, and political. It recognizes aesthetic performances as
political acts and political performances as aesthetic acts within a
relational, which is to say ethical, ensemble. For Moten, the practice
of improvisation also confounds reified past-present-future
distinctions. His discussion does not only imply that such
aesthetic-ethical-political practices may anticipate, by enacting, what
hasn't yet happened. It also suggests that they anticipate that which is
not yet known, a wish that can only emerge through present practice and
performance. He thus links improvisation to the "unsayable claims of
black utopian political desire, an unrequited love imaged after the
fact."94 Raising the question of "improvisation's time and the time of
ensemble's organization" Moten writes of the "attempt . . . to sustain
the desire that you anticipate, that you'll have felt even now, to stop
to look up, to sing the inscription."95 This will and capacity to see
and sing the inscription in order to sustain the desire that you
anticipate is one way to understand prophecy. In a recent interview
[Moten remarks, "The prophet is the one who **tells the brutal truth**,
who has the capacity to **see the absolute brutality of the
already-existing** and to **point it out** and to **tell that truth**,
but also to **see the other way**, to **see what it could be**. That
double-sense, that double-capacity: to see **what's right in front of
you** and to see through it to **what's ahead of you**."]{.underline}96
Moten thereby voices an insight that has long been recognized by Jewish
Marxist and black radical thinkers -- namely that [anticipation is
**less a matter of predicting the future** than of "**foreseeing the
present**."]{.underline}97 In 1940 Walter Benjamin described the
paradoxical character of the "prophetic relation to the future" by
noting that "the seer's gaze is kindled by the rapidly receding past . .
. the prophet has turned away from the future: he perceives the contours
of the future in the fading light of the past as it sinks before him
into the night of times."98 A few years later, during the war that would
take Benjamin's life, Aimé Césaire identified "the ground of poetic
knowledge" as "an astonishing mobilization of all human and cosmic
forces" in which "all lived experience. All the possibility . . . all
the pasts, all the futures . . . Everything is summoned. Everything
awaits."99 And the "visionary" speaker in his 1946 poem declares, "my
ear to the ground, I heard Tomorrow pass."100 Decades later, but in a
similar spirit, Edouard [Glissant writes about]{.underline} the
existence within Caribbean thought and consciousness of ["a prophetic
vision of the past" based on "the identification of a **painful notion
of time** and its **full projection forward** into the
future."]{.underline}101 [Perhaps people compelled by history to inhabit
a painful sense of time are gifted with a **prophetic sense of the
past** and a **capacity** (and **necessity**) to **foresee the
present**]{.underline}. Running through these otherwise distinct
reflections is the insight that [anticipation entails **sudden** or
**stolen glimpses** across epochal divides. It names the]{.underline}
proleptic [power of acting "as if" impossible futures were **already at
hand**.]{.underline} 6. Dialectics of Anticipation [[What links
these]{.mark} various concrete utopian experiments]{.underline},
thinkers, and traditions [[is not only a commitment to
**radical**]{.mark} politics, direct **[democracy]{.mark}**, or
autonomous socialism. [They]{.mark} also [share a **distinctive
orientation to futurity**]{.mark}. Their reflections and actions point
**[beyond both]{.mark} the fiction of [liberal progress]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} the **fantasy of [apocalyptic rupture]{.mark}**[. They
**reject the given order**, **envision a better world**, and **act as if
the impossible were possible**]{.mark} -- even while mindful that new
forms **cannot be planned** and **implemented** but **can only emerge
practically**, **experimentally**. We can]{.underline} thus [think of
anticipation as a]{.underline} kind of [**political disposition**
whereby radical actors **cultivate a state of readiness for any possible
possibility** and a **will to overcome existing arrangements** by acting
from the standpoint of a not-yet redeemed world. We can think of
anticipation as an **untimely desire to recognize** and **pursue
alternative possibilities** that are enabled by and condensed within
present arrangements]{.underline}. From this perspective, [anticipation
prefigures by enacting the supposedly impossible. It indexes a
**politico-temporal orientation**, rather than an **affective state** or
an **ideological discourse**. As a critical political concept,
anticipation is **neither about planning** nor **waiting**. It **rejects
nihilistic presentism** but also **avoids the false opposition between
liberal progress** and **apocalyptic rupture**]{.underline}. (Or we can
say that [it rejects liberal progress while avoiding the false
opposition between nihilistic presentism and apocalyptic
rupture]{.underline}.) Through an immanent critique of actual relations
that allows actors to recognize supposedly impossible possibilities, by
tacking dialectically between creative imagination and experimental
practices, anticipation seeks to balance the dual imperative to insist
on an open future and to envision envisioning a good life. [We
might]{.underline} therefore [refer to a dialectics of anticipation
marked by the dual imperatives to **be open to the impossible** and to
**imagine the possible**, to **envision** and **enact**, to seize the
sudden illumination as it appears and seek to produce it through
everyday life]{.underline}. A dialectical concept of anticipation is a
calling for that is also a calling forth, an enacted idea that may bring
into being what it desires through the performance itself (even as that
very image of future possibilities only arises through such performative
acts). Anticipatory politics are therefore also aesthetic operations
(and vice versa). [[**Neither about optimism nor pessimism**,
these]{.mark} concrete utopian practices **[cut across reified
distinctions]{.mark}** between immanence and transcendence, present and
future, actual and possible, instrumental and utopian, imagination and
action]{.underline}, strategy and spontaneity, politics and performance.
[[**Anticipation** signals a readiness to **interrupt the continuum**
and]{.mark} a **[commitment to live otherwise]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[They are not only "practices" in the sense of doing, they are forms of
practice in the sense of **learning**, of **getting better
at**]{.underline} -- in this case, [getting better at being the kind of
person, living the kind life, entering into the types of social
relations that will **only be really possible**, or **possibly
realized**, in a **future order**.]{.underline}

Given this AQ forum on Patrick Wolfe's Traces of History: Elementary
Structures of Race (2016), [I want to take up his work to examine
Afro-Pessimism]{.underline} in relation to issues raised by the exchange
recounted above. I take up the question of Afro-Pessimism in this
context, since Wolfe repeatedly states (and deftly demonstrates),
"**[[race is not a static ontology]{.underline}]{.mark}**."6 He notes,
"As its name suggests, [\[[race\] is an]{.mark} ongoing,
[**ever-shifting** contest]{.mark}.]{.underline}"7 Among many other
interventions, [Traces of [History challenges the understanding that
blackness]{.mark} was or [is transcendent]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [**To
assert blackness as ontological is to recapitulate colonizing thought**,
to take **colonial ideology as truth**]{.underline}]{.mark}. However,
[Wolfe went beyond merely stating that race is a social
construct]{.underline}. As Ben Silverstein put it in his memorial essay,
"Patrick insisted instead on [thinking about race as one element of the
Althusserian totality, an overdetermining level of the social
formation]{.underline}."8 [Wolfe therefore brings "poststructuralist
rigor to bear on materialist approaches to ideology]{.underline}."9
Through his careful historical work, [Wolfe theorized race as a process,
examining racialization as practice alongside race as
doctrine.]{.underline} He argued, "[race is colonialism
speaking]{.underline}."10 In other words, [**European colonizers
racialized the colonized** in specific ways that mark and
reproduce]{.underline} (in ways that can change across time) [the
unequal relationships into which colonial actors initially co-opted
these populations]{.underline}.¶ [Wolfe's theory enables a critique of
racialization **as an effect of colonialism**, the working out in
practice of colonial ideology]{.underline}. This is why [he called for a
shift "**from the register of race to that of
colonialism**]{.underline}," [identifying dimensions of the colonial
dispensation that "cannot be expressed in the language of phe-notypes."
The difference here, then, between Wolfe and Wilderson]{.underline} (as
well as other Afro-Pessimists), [is that they register not from race to
colonialism]{.underline}, or even from race to slavery, [but slavery to
race. **Wilderson universalizes a particular rendition**]{.underline}
[of black experience]{.underline} [to claim that the Black Body is in a
perpetual state of ontological death because of the violence of the
Middle Passage]{.underline}. He traces to when Arabs inaugurated this
thirteen hundred years ago with the opening of the African slave
trade.11 [His main argument for the ontological death]{.underline} (cast
in singular terms) of the Black Body [is because of Blacks' incapacity
to develop their own subjectivity]{.underline}. As he puts it,
"Blackness is incapacity in its pure and unadulterated form."12¶ [To get
at this problematic, [I offer]{.mark} a brief account of [Bacon's
Rebellion as]{.mark} an example of [a case in which **the Black Body is
not socially dead**]{.mark}]{.underline}---[not
incapacitated]{.underline}. Thus [[I challenge the **ontological
absolutism**]{.mark} that is [endemic to Afro-Pessimist thought]{.mark}
at large. Several black radical scholars have challenged this
"ontological absolutism]{.underline}." For example, David Marriott
notes, "[Wilderson is prepared to say that black suffering is not only
beyond analogy, it also refigures the whole of being. It is not hard
when reading such sentences to **suspect a kind of [absolutism]{.mark}
at work**]{.underline} here, and [one that [manages to be]{.mark}
peculiarly and **[dispiritingly dogmatic]{.mark}**]{.underline}."13
Moreover, Marriott argues that [[the claim that "Blackness is
incapacity]{.mark} in its most pure and unadulterated form means merely
that the black has to embody this abjection without
reserve]{.underline}. . . . [This logic---and the denial of any kind of
'ontological integrity' to the Black/Slave]{.underline} due to its
endless traversal by force **[does seem to [reduce ontology
to]{.mark}]{.underline}** logic, namely, a logic of
**[[non-recuperability]{.underline}]{.mark}**."14¶ My critique here is
rooted in historicizing race---that active element of
racialization---races as "traces" of history. Hence, [looking
at]{.underline} the case study of [Bacon's Rebellion, I challenge
[Wilderson's]{.mark} advancement of a purity [argument]{.mark} that also
[happens to be **ahistorical**]{.mark}]{.underline}. I come at this
debate as a scholar of sovereignty, race, and indigeneity trying to
reckon with these troubling formulations.15 [[Bacon's Rebellion shows
that]{.mark} racialized [chattel slavery was a]{.mark} deliberate
[choice the]{.mark} English [elites came to]{.mark} over
time]{.underline}. And here I draw on Wolfe's Traces of History, along
with the work of the historian Edmund Morgan, to offer a rudimentary
overview.16¶ In 1619 Virginia, West Africans arrived after the Dutch
sold them as slaves to the English settlers. However, the English did
not immediately devise this status for them; they were not slaves in the
sense of persons reduced as property and required to work for life
without wages.17 In 1619 Virginia had no law legalizing slavery, and
many Africans were sold as bonded laborers orindentured servants who
lived and labored alongside poor Europeans---bound by contract to serve
a master in order to repay the expense of their passage and other
debts.18 Some worked in the fields side by side, lived together, ate
together, shared housing, and more. Yet, as early as 1630, the English
started singling out Africans for differential treatment, such as meting
out worse punishments for running away and refusing to allow them to
carry arms. Still, during this period, there were property-owning free
Africans in the Chesapeake (e.g., Anthony Johnson, who arrived in
1621).19¶ [This history shows that [the course of
race]{.mark}]{.underline} in seventeenth-century Virginia **[[was not
predetermined]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [a point more than a few
historians have made]{.underline}.20 The plantation system and the
expansion of settler capitalism that furthered English settler control
over and conquest of native lands demanded additional pliant, captive
labor. However, **[[a racially based system]{.mark} of chattel slavery
[was not]{.mark} a [foregone]{.mark} conclusion]{.underline}**. As Wolfe
put it: "[It was not until the juridical opposition of slave versus free
became mapped onto the hereditary opposition of Black versus White that
being born a Black person meant being born a slave."]{.underline}21
Thus, as Wolfe insists, "in addition to its circumstantial trajectory,
[the developing equation of Blackness with slavery needs to be
understood **in relation to its historicity**]{.underline}: [to the
particular conditions whereby this formula rather than any
other]{.underline}---convict labour, **[fixed-term
slavery]{.underline}**, a contract system---came to be selected as the
optimal arrangement."22 In 1661 the Virginia Assembly began to legally
institutionalize slavery, and by 1662 came codes that determined the
status of a child by the status of the mother. In 1669 the law defined
enslaved Africans as property. However, planters still preferred white
indentured labor. But 1670 saw a decrease in the number of European
indentured servants migrating to Virginia, since Governor Berkeley had
restricted suffrage to landowners. These are the conditions that
contributed to Bacon's Rebellion, as six out of seven men were "poor,
discontented, and armed."23¶ [The insurrection emerged from the
outgrowth of the push for profit from the production of
tobacco]{.underline}, and its attendant demand for both land and labor.
The complaint of freed indentured servants was they faced barriers to
getting Indian land because of the emergent elite planter class. Hence
it should be no surprise that Bacon's Rebellion began with conflict over
how to deal with Indian tribes viewed as violent obstructionists to
settler colonial expansion. Bacon saw the colony's policy on tribes as
dismissive, especially after two Indian raids (the 1622 massacre by the
Powhatans and a 1675 attack by the Doeg). His demands to preemptively
massacre all Indians were not accepted by the governor, and so in
response Bacon rallied his own troops against Berkeley for his refusal
to retaliate for Native attacks on frontier settlements. Bacon
orga-nized thousands of indentured servants, bond laborers, and
slaves---English, Irish, Scottish, and African---who joined the frontier
mutiny.¶ In 1675, when Berkeley denied Bacon a commission (the authority
to lead soldiers), Bacon took it upon himself to lead his followers in a
crusade against the "enemy." In a classic divide and conquer move, they
marched to a fort held by a "friendly" tribe, the Occaneechees, and
convinced them to capture warriors from an "unfriendly" tribe, the
Susquehannock. The Occaneechees returned with captives, but Bacon's men
turned to the allied tribe and opened fire, killing them. After months
of conflict, Bacon's forces burned Jamestown to the ground on September
19, 1676. They drove Berkeley back to England and effectively shut down
all tobacco production for over a year.¶ Scholars and activists alike
have perpetuated some romanticized accounts of the rebellion as a
historical moment when poor Africans and Europeans united to fight their
common exploiters (the English elite). Other accounts narrate it as a
missed opportunity, given that poor Europeans eventually went the "white
way," joining elites against those increasingly racialized as "black."
Thus [the Rebellion is also told as a genealogy of "whiteness" as a
racial category and the "hidden origins" of race-based chattel
slavery]{.underline}. As the story usually goes, the English elites,
fearing class unity across racial lines, began to impose different
standards when punishing the rebels---with harsher sentences against
Africans. And since they were more easily identifiable than Europeans, a
preference toward the importation of enslaved African slaves grew.
Today, Bacon's Rebellion is often evoked among the white Left as a
reminder that elites will divide and conquer, keeping whites and Blacks
from unifying. But what drops out in this lamenting account is that they
were allied in challenging the English elites through their united
efforts to commit genocide against indigenous peoples. This settler
colonial context---imbricated with the North American institution of
slavery---is often erased.24¶ Also, to return to Wolfe, although he
links racial slavery to Indian dispossession, he does not discuss what
poor Europeans and Africans were unified for besides challenging the
English elite. In other words, he does not mention Bacon's fixation on
eliminating Indians through genocide and contesting Berkeley's policy
regarding the tribes. Still, Wolfe and other historians have noted that
the rebellion hastened the hardening of racial lines associated with
slavery, as a way for planters and the colony to control some of the
poor, which led to the passage of the Virginia Slave Codes of 1705.25
After Bacon's Rebellion, planters turned to Africa as their primary
source of labor and to slavery as their main system of labor, rather
than European indentured labor. The landed gentry systematically
developed a workforce based on racial caste, and the 1680 Virginia
legislature enacted laws that denied slaves freedom of mobility and
assembly. New legislation sharpened the color line, and by 1710 a
racially based system of chattel slavery was fixed in Virginia (and
Maryland).26¶ [Wolfe's treatment of racial formation on black slavery
and racial caste]{.underline} in Traces of History [is key to
understanding the aftermath of the revolt]{.underline}. [He shows how
**[race is constructed to challenge the ahistorical and universal claim
that Afro-Pessimists hold]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Returning to
Wilderson, then, [[Bacon's Rebellion offers]{.mark} just [one example in
which Blacks]{.mark}]{.underline} (in Wilderson's terms)---or, rather,
Africans not yet "Black"---[[exercised]{.mark} some [capacity]{.mark}
over another group.]{.underline} But, while they asserted leverage over
tribes, as agents in unity with poor Europeans, the terms of agency were
set by and defined within the settler racial capitalist system that was
also oppressing them.27 And unlike European workers, who were exploited,
the Dutch enslaved the Africans before selling them as "cargo" in North
America. This is a crucial difference demarcating the vast structural
differences impinging on them.¶ Still, [[this]{.mark} historical episode
[challenges]{.mark} the timeline Wilderson claims regarding [the
**ontological imprint**]{.mark} and its inauguration. The specificity of
racially based chattel slavery]{.underline} in the context of English
settlement in North America---and the institutional incapacity it
wrought for enslaved Africans---[differs]{.underline} from the Middle
Ages in the Arab world. [It is as if [Wilderson]{.mark} were drawing on
the particularity of the experiences of African peoples in North America
to make a universal argument]{.underline}. Furthermore, **[he [reads
"Black" outside the history]{.mark} of the making of race]{.underline}**
[[that]{.mark} this historical period shows [was a process. **This
totalizing interpretation** ]{.mark}**of black experience**]{.underline}
[in claiming that "the Black Body" is [in]{.mark} a perpetual state of
[ontological death]{.mark}]{.underline}, then, [[seems bound to
this]{.mark} historically **[specific context]{.mark}**]{.underline},
all the **[[while disavowing that specificity]{.underline}]{.mark}**.¶
Tamar Blickstein, a mutual friend of Wolfe's and mine, recently reminded
me that Patrick said that he hoped Traces of History would be something
people "could run with." I hope that taking his work and running with
it--- to critically examine [the argument that "Blackness is incapacity
in its pure and unadulterated form"---elucidates the colonial and racial
politics of what constitutes capacity in terms of agency. Attention to
the rebellion]{.underline}, then, also [illustrates the problems with
ahistorical projections of blackness across space and time, showing that
we must attend to how this category gets **constructed in place and
time**]{.underline}---and [in relation to colonial and capitalist
systems]{.underline}. Instead of seeing Bacon's rebellion as a missed
opportunity for poor European and poor Africans, the historical event
reveals a lost chance for alliance politics between African and
indigenous peoples.28¶ Wolfe insisted that addressing questions of
solidarity must include a consideration of the legacies (the functions
and outcomes) of racialization. He made it clear in Traces of History
that it is necessary to interrogate racial categories and
complementarities, refusing simple solidarities and examining the

"Thoughts on two recent decades of studying race and racism," *Social
Identities* (May): 1-10. Emory Libraries.

As I focused primarily on antiblack racism, the question of whether all
other forms of racism are the same emerged. [Blackness functions, after
all, in peculiar ways in societies that have produced antiblack
racism]{.underline}. A response to the #BlackLivesMatter movement, for
instance, is often that 'all lives matter'. That is true the extent to
which each group lives under conditions of equal respect for life. What
advocates of #BlackLivesMatter are doing, however, is responding to a
world in which some lives matter a lot more than others, whose lives
evidentially matter a lot less. The history of antiblack racism amounts
to the conviction that black people are only valuable the extent to
which there is use for their labor or, worse, profiting from their
misfortune as we see with the heavily racialized prison industrial
complexes in the United States and similar countries (Alexander, 2010;
Davis, 1983, 2005). It collapses into the expectation of justified
existence in a context in which the justification for whoever stands as
most valued is intrinsic. Members of the dominant group could thus seek
their justification -- if they wish -- personally, through mechanisms of
love, professional recognition, athletic achievement, etc. Moreover,
that such society renders some groups as positive and others as negative
leads to notions of legitimate presence (illegitimate absence) and
absence (illegitimate presence). [[Should]{.mark} the [analysis
remain]{.mark} at [white and black, the world would]{.mark}, however,
[appear]{.mark} more [closed]{.mark} **than it in fact
is**]{.underline}. [For one, simply being born black would bar the
possibility of any legitimate appearance]{.underline}. [This is a
position that has been taken by]{.underline} a growing group of
theorists known as ['Afropessimists']{.underline}, [for whom ['black'
signifies]{.mark} absolute ['social death']{.mark}]{.underline}
(**[Sexton]{.underline}**, 2010, 2011; **[Wilderson]{.underline}**,
2007, 2008, 2009). It is, in other words, outside of relations. [My
**objections** to this view are **many**]{.underline}. [For one, [no
human being is 'really' any of these things]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Do
blacks]{.underline}]{.mark}[, for instance, [suffer social death in
relation to each other?]{.mark}]{.underline} [The **project** of making
people into such is one thing]{.underline}. [The **achievement** of such
is another]{.underline}. [This is an observation Fanon also makes in his
formulation of the zone of nonbeing and his critique of otherness in the
study of race]{.underline} in Black Skin, White Masks, which I discuss
at length my (Gordon, 2015) study, What Fanon Said: A Philosophical
Introduction to His Life and Thought¶ Fanon (1952) is critical of how
otherness is interpreted in race theories and the study of race. The
rejection of otherness ignores the fact that others are human beings.
Racism emerges in attempts to deny that. Instead, it offers the zone of
nonbeing, non-appearance as human beings. The racially dominant group
presumes self-justified reality (license), which means it doesn't call
itself into question. And the designated racially inferior group?
Lacking justification, their access to being is illegitimate. This means
their absence is a mark of the system's legitimacy. Such groups face the
Catch 22 of illegitimate appearance: To appear is to violate appearance.
Put differently, the violation is one of appearing without a license to
do such. To all this, a consideration that should be added is this: The
human being comes to the fore through emerging from being in the first
place. Thus, the assertion of Being, as in the thought of Heidegger and
his followers is also an effort to push the human being out of
existence, so to speak. Heidegger, fair enough in his 'Letter on
Humanism' (1947/1971), saw no problem in this. Fanon (1952), and many
others in Africana philosophy, including the South African philosopher
and psychologist Noël Chabani Manganyi (1973, 1977), disagreed through
showing how racial conflict is also an existential one in which an
existential ontology is posed against an ontology of being. The latter,
we submit, is best suited for gods. When such becomes the model of being
human, humanity dies. Blacks thus face the paradox of existing (standing
out, living -- as ex sistere means such) as non-existence (not standing
out). Antiblack racism makes black appearance illicit.¶ Licit appearance
would mean appearing as selves and others. It would mean the right to
appear. Antiracist struggles will not work, then, as a struggle against
otherness. It is, instead, against being non-selves and non-others.¶
[Returning to the Afropessmistic notion of blackness as social death,
I'm compelled to ask: [Why **must** the social world be premised on the
attitudes]{.mark} and perspectives [of]{.mark} antiblack [racists? Why
don't blacks among each other]{.mark} and other communities of color
[count as social]{.mark} perspectives? If the question of racism is a
function of **unequal power**, which it clearly is, why not offer a
study of power, how it is gained and lost, **instead of an assertion**
of its **manifestations as ontological?**¶]{.underline} I'm reminded
here of Victor Anderson's (1995) Beyond Ontological Blackness. Anderson
would no doubt object that [[Afropessimism treats 'blackness' as]{.mark}
an [ontological, which makes **it**]{.mark} **a
[self-sustaining]{.mark}** [(non-relational)]{.mark}
concept]{.underline}. [[The **historical emergence of blackness refutes
that**]{.mark}. But more, [there is a **logical paradox**]{.mark} that
emerges from ontological blackness]{.underline}. [[To identify
blackness, one must be **in a relation to it**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}
[This relational matter **requires looking beyond blackness**
**ironically** in order to understand blackness]{.underline}. [This
means moving from the conception of meaning as singular,
substance-based, and fixed into the grammar of how meaning is
produced]{.underline}.¶ Consider the grammar of gender. Women
historically occupy the role of absence (de Beauvoir, 1949; Butler,
2011; Gordon, 1995/1999, 1997). Blackness and womanness are thus
intimate (Gordon, 1995/1999, 1997). The grammar of presence and absence
is peculiarly theodicean (Gordon, 2010, 2013). This is the form of
mauvaise-foi in which presence takes on the hubris of the desire to be a
(often the) god. Theodicy defends the integrity of the god (systemic
maintenance) through placing its contradictions (for example, evil)
outside of it. The result is Being as a form of systemic purity
(Monahan, 2011, 2017). This grammar is also psychoanalytical, in the
sense of existential psychoanalysis. Manichean 'qualities' (such as
'hard' masculinity and 'soft' femininity) are evident in these modes of
being. This pertains as well to sexual orientation: A white man's
relation to a black man is not only one of race-to-race but also of
race-to-gender where the meaning of being black (as 'feminine' and
'sexual') could collapse into gendered absence. And extended to the
sexualization of absence -- think of the plethora of literature on the
feminine as soft, cold, dark, and absence. The relation among males in
which one group manifests such qualities immediately collapses into a
homoerotic one (Fanon, 1952; Gordon, 1995/1999, 1997, 2000).¶ We see
here a conception of dealing with racial and gender qualities that are
today called 'intersectional', though that metaphor doesn't at first
quite work for their existential phenomenological psychoanalytical
manifestations in mauvaise-foi (because purity seeks singularity). The
major proponent of intersectionality -- Kimberlé Crenshaw -- is pretty
clear that she is referring to identity collisions as they appear in law
(especially tort and discrimination law); in other words, she is
referring to harms that, because of how they are interpreted, don't
appear (supposedly don't exist) despite their lived-reality. She often
illustrates her point through her famous example of a collision at a
four-way intersection (Crenshaw, 1991, 2014). If the fundamental site of
harm is property, the concern will be about the cars, and if their
status of property depends on being owned by, say, white men, then harm
would pertain to them. If the location of harm expands simply to
'whites', then a white woman or man in one of the cars would be
sufficient for harm having occurred. If, however, there were no whites
in the cars, then the conclusion would be that no one was harmed. If
harm extends to blacks and other people of color, and even further, to
non-human animals, then any of them being in the car or cars would
initiate a cause for redress. Notice that Crenshaw's argument doesn't
deny the possibility of white men being harmed. Her point is that people
such as black women were not historically acknowledged in the legal
frameworks of harmed subjects because of a failure to see that human
beings do not manifest a single category of identity on which to build a
legal response. Simply referring to 'man' as the exemplar of human being
fails to acknowledge that human beings are not only men but also women,
and simply as 'women' fails to address what kind of women such as those
of color and different sexual orientations.¶ At an existential level,
what is also missed is the lived-reality of the convergence of these and
their social and legal implications. A black woman in an automobile
collision is, for example, not just harmed but also harmed in ways
linked to the wider legal framework of the society. The criminalization
of black women and men, for instance, could mean that though harmed in
the collision, such people may face the possibility of entanglement in a
legal system that treats them as the cause of harm, which could lead to
other dangers such as ensnarement in the criminal justice system. This
is one of the reasons why, even when harmed, many people of color don't
seek the aid of law enforcement and other representatives of that
system. Crenshaw's theory therefore has an existential and
phenomenological significance in that it is an argument for the
appearance of what is otherwise treated as either non-existent or not
worthy of appearing, of, that is, illicit appearance. Her theory is also
about the radicalization of appearance in that the identified subjects
emerge, so to speak, not only in terms of being seen but also through an
effort to see what they see or experience -- in short, to see or at
least understand their point of view in terms of the conditions they
face. It is thus not a subjective theory or a narrowly objective one but
instead an intersubjective theory because it requires understanding how
different human beings relate to and encounter legal structures --
products of the human world -- as simultaneously alienating and
enabling.¶ Crenshaw's concept of an intersection could, however, be
interpreted in problematic ways. The first is the geometric model of an
intersection. That version presupposes well-formed or complete lines
converging. A response would be that there was never a complete 'whole'
or, as the feminist phenomenological communicologist Sara Ahmed (2006)
would put it, 'straight line' with regard to human subjects in the first
place. The queer phenomenological theorist David Ross Fryer (2008), in
stream with Ahmed, offers the logical conclusion of this critique --
namely, a fundamental queerness at the heart of race theory and related
areas of study such as gender studies and queer theory. My recent work
in philosophy of culture extends such a concern to the human condition
as well -- that is, the upsurge from being makes human reality a queer
one. This is pretty much the argument articulated earlier with regard to
questions raised by Fanon's analysis of ontology, existential ontology,
and the dialectics of selves and others. ¶ [The second critical
consideration is that as all human beings are manifestations of
**different dimensions of meaning**, the question of [identity requires
more than an]{.mark} intersecting model, otherwise there will simply be
one [(a priori)]{.mark} normative [outcome]{.mark} in every moment of
inquiry: Whoever manifests the maximum manifestation of predetermined
negative intersecting terms. [That would]{.mark} in effect [be]{.mark}
an essence before an existence -- indeed, **[before an]{.mark} actual
[event]{.mark} of harm**]{.underline}. Some race theorists' tendency to
build their arguments on a particular group as 'most oppressed' without
offering evidence for the continued truth of such a claim is an example
of this fallacy. This observation emerges as well where pessimism is the
guiding attitude. An existential critique would be that [optimism and
pessimism are symptomatic of the same attitude: **a priori assertions on
reality**]{.underline}. [Human [existence is **contingent**
]{.mark}**but not accidental**, which means that [the social
world]{.mark} at hand [is a manifestation of]{.mark} choices and
relationships -- in other words, **[human
actions]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [As [human beings can]{.mark}
only **[build the future]{.mark} instead of it determining us**, the
task at hand **depends on commitment** -- what is to be done **without**
guarantees of outcome]{.underline}. This concern also pertains to the
initial concerns about authenticity. One could only be pessimistic about
an outcome, an activity. [It's an act of forecasting what could only be
meaningful once actually performed]{.underline}. Similarly, one could
only be optimistic about the same. [What, however, if there were no way
to know either?]{.underline} [Here we come to the foi element in
mauvaise foi]{.underline}. [[Some actions are **deontological**]{.mark},
and if not that, they are at least reflections of our commitments, our
projects]{.underline}. [Thus, [the point]{.mark} of some actions
[**isn't** about]{.mark} their [success or failure but **whether we deem
them worth doing**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Fanon, 1961/ 1991; Gordon,
2015). [Taking responsibility for such actions -- bringing value to them
-- is opposed to another manifestation of mauvaise-foi: the spirit of
**seriousness**]{.underline}.¶ [The spirit of seriousness involves
attributing a form of materiality to human values that elides the human
role in the construction of those values]{.underline} (de Beauvoir,
1947; Gordon, 1995/1999; Sartre, 1943). [The importance of this concept
pertains to the understanding of racism not only as a social phenomenon
but also a value]{.underline}. It addresses what Abdul JanMohamed (2005,
2011) calls our social investments. Racists are 'serious' people and
racism is the system that supports such values as supposedly objective
features of reality. In other words, the formers' values are preserved
in the latter as ontological.¶ All this leads to an often-overlooked
consideration: [Discussions of race and racism make no sense without a
philosophical anthropology]{.underline}. [Euro-modernity denied the
humanity of whole groups of people, which means the question of what it
is to be human was crucial]{.underline}. These considerations emerged
not only in colonial and racist terms but also at reflective levels of
method as hegemonic models of 'science' began to dominate concerns for
legitimacy. [Many such models were premised, however, on ideological
frameworks in which greater value was placed on 'purity' in which
mixture is supposedly 'impure']{.underline}. The result is a
philosophical anthropology in search of so-called purity as a standard
of not only human value but also identity. The above discussion of
intersectionality already challenges this thesis. In addition to my
work, theorists posing such challenges at methodological levels include
Jane Anna Gordon (2014; J. A. Gordon & Roberts, 2015) and Michael
Monahan (2011). The arguments they advance reject any philosophical
anthropology of converging 'purities', where separate, pure 'races'
meet. Instead, the notion of racial purity is rejected from the outset.
Rejected also at methodological levels, purity, they argue, obscures
lived realities of mixture. In other words, [[the actual human
world]{.mark} is not one of purity (being-in-and-by-itself) but instead
relations of living negations of purity (existence,
being-and-negations-of-and-for-being, and more)]{.underline}. J. Gordon
and Monahan prefer the term creolizing for this reason, as it is, they
contend, a radical kind of mixture -- one that in effect manifests not
only new forms of being but also challenges the stasis of being. Their
use of the present participle is to illustrate that mixing -- especially
of the licit and the illicit -- [[is **not**]{.mark} **a [closed]{.mark}
achievement** (an 'event') but instead an **ongoing activity of
reality**]{.underline}. From their argument, purity, like normativity,
is an effort of imposing closure on the openness or, pointing back to
Fryer, queer dimensions of reality. Put differently, [[ascribing
ontological status]{.underline}]{.mark} to purity and straightness
**[[doesn't work]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[It requires]{.mark}, in
effect, **[denying]{.mark} the elements of [reality]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}that don't match up [and]{.mark} involves [attempting to force
reality into a]{.mark} preferred or **pleasing [falsehood]{.mark}**
instead of a (for the purist) displeasing truth]{.underline}. In effect,
creolizing militates against disciplinary decadence or, in other words,
mauvaise foi. As the context is human reality, the conclusion of
presenting an open anthropology comes to the fore. This openness raises
the question of the relationship between humanity and freedom.

### AT: Paraontology 

#### Their theory of paraontology is self-defeating\-\--it is unable to separate itself from the ontological analysis it attempts to escape\-\--their author

**Warren 17** Calvin, Assistant Professor at Emory University (WGSS),
\"Black Mysticism: Fred Moten's Phenomenology of (Black) Spirit.\"
Zeitschrift Für Anglistik Und Amerikanistik, vol. 65, no. 2, 2017, pp.
219.

Indeed, [[Moten's]{.mark} philosophical [translation]{.mark} and
appropriation [of Heidegger stops short]{.mark} of Heidegger's
'solution' to the problem of metaphysics; [Moten offers no solution
to]{.mark} the problem of [anti-Blackness]{.mark} other than the
assertion that blackness in an anti-black world functions as a
"pathogen" and that it "bears or is the potential to end the
world"]{.underline} (Moten 2013, 739). But how exactly does blackness
destroy anti-Blackness as pathogen? It is certainly the case that
[[Moten]{.mark} [is]{.mark} primarily [concerned with blackness and not
anti-Blackness]{.mark}; but given this, it becomes difficult for Moten
to convince African American Criticism of its need to shift emphasis
when blacks are suffering daily from anti-Blackness]{.underline}.
Afro-Pessimists would argue that the idea of a solution to
anti-Blackness is a myth, since the analytic tools used to eradicate
anti-Blackness are themselves infused with anti-Blackness. Moten might
well agree with this double-bind, but he avoids this sense of pessimism
by not discussing anti-Blackness explicitly. He is much more interested
in the paraontology of blackness than a phenomenology of anti-
Blackness. [But [to shift]{.mark} emphasis [from]{.mark} the obsessional
object of [political ontology]{.mark} to the wonder of blackness [will
require a strong]{.mark} philosophical [justification for
paraontology]{.mark} over the phenomenology of anti-Blackness -- if not,
**[paraontology could]{.mark} very easily [become an anti-black
structure]{.mark}** [within discourses seeking to deny or avoid the
reality of black suffering.]{.mark}]{.underline} But does blackness have
an obligation to black people? And if not, why not? What is the
relationship between anti-black suffering and blackness? Is it possible
to have blackness without black people? (This mirrors the provocative
question asked at a conference on Black Studies: Can we ethically
'practice' Black Studies without black scholars and black students?)
Moten seems to suggest as such: blackness is present (as E.P. Thompson
said of the English working class) at its own making and that all the
people who are called black are given in and to that presence, which
exceeds them (in an irrevocable, antenational combination of terror and
enjoyment, longing and rejection, that Hartman, in particular
illuminates). Ultimately, the paraontological force that is transmitted
in the long chain of life and death performances that are the concern of
black studies is horribly misunderstood if it is understood exclusive,
which is to say everyone can claim blackness. That claim is neither the
last anticipatory reorientation but is, rather, an irreducible element
of the differentially repeating plane that intersects and animates the
comparativist sphere. (Moten 2008a, 1746) [Black people are 'touched by
blackness']{.underline} (blackness is presented to them much like Being
is presented to Dasein for Heidegger), [but blackness is not the
property of black people.]{.underline} Blackness becomes what
philosopher Mary Jane Rubenstein might call "strange wonder" (cf.
Rubenstein 2010) -- a wonder that Heidegger described as the
groundlessness of Being. Because it is without ground, this wonder
cannot be objectified or owned as the property of this or that group of
persons. The relationship between black people and blackness is not one
that Moten explicitly articulates, primarily because he is attempting to
detach blackness from black people and conceptualize blackness as a
mystical abstraction appearing to the world. [[Blackness]{.mark}, here,
[becomes the site of a looking away]{.mark}, a desire to escape that for
which we no longer will engage. (But **[if we close our eyes to
political ontology]{.mark}, do [we risk additional injuries]{.mark}**?
Is there a certain value to our obsession with the entity that has the
potential to destroy us? Can we escape that which we do not fully know?)
This impasse is precisely the violence that Afro-Pessimists see at the
heart of such enterprises of escape, fugitivity, freedom, and
emancipation.]{.underline} When Moten describes the paraontological as
the "not so strange combination of Nahum Chandler and Martin Heidegger"
(Moten 2007, n. pag.), we might suggest that the juxtaposition of
Chandler and Heidegger invokes Derrida's critique of Heidegger, since
Nahum Chandler is our finest proponent of deconstruction in Black
Studies. Derrida's critique of Heidegger, of course, was that he was
entangled in the very metaphysical structure he sought to destroy.
Destruktion disclosed itself as reinscription and repetition. [It is the
[re-inscription of ontology within the paraontological]{.mark} that
[haunts Moten's]{.mark} philosophical [enterprise]{.mark}, for indeed,
can we ever truly wrest paraontology from the ontology that
distinguishes it? Does not the trace of the other (ontology) inevitably
infuse itself into the sphere that purportedly excludes it
(paraontology) -- as its illegitimate foundation?]{.underline} Is the
'para' here an actuality or a yearning for reprieve? In other words:
Does the pathogen need its host to survive? To put this somewhat
differently, if the issue with African American Criticism is that it is
preoccupied with ontology and formations of anti-Blackness that sustain
it, according to Moten, then we might say that it is ontological
thinking that is at the root of this problem. We forget blackness
because we are unable to disentangle our investigations from the
thinking and procedure of Western ontology and metaphysics. To address
this, Moten wants to 'think otherwise' (much like Heidegger attempted to
do with his concept An-denken). But herein lies the problem: [[Moten
is]{.mark} still [entangled in the]{.mark} very
[metaphysical-ontological enterprise he wants to escape because his
analytic depends on the distinction between blackness and
blacks.]{.mark} The significance of this is two-fold: not only is this
binary opposition between blackness and blacks [a **product of
binary-metaphysical/ontological thinking**]{.mark} -- thus [a
reproduction of the]{.mark} very [thing he wants to flee]{.mark} -- but
[**he lacks an analytic framework**]{.mark} and a lexicon [that can
transcend the constraints of ontology]{.mark}. Moten still operates
within ontology through binary oppositions and terminology. The
difficulty of such an enterprise is that [we do not have a grammar
outside of ontology to describe the paraontological]{.mark}, which means
that his idea of [paraontology is still tethered]{.mark} to that which
it is designed to escape. **[Paraontology becomes another]{.mark}
version of [ontology]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} Moten is as much obsessed with
ontology as Afro- Pessimists. But this obsession is inescapable; there
is no way out (which is what Afro-Pessimists have been emphasizing). We
can become creative with prepositions and prefixes and say that
[**paraontology is not 'outside' of ontology, but 'through it'**]{.mark}
'within it,' 'alongside,' etc. -- but [these]{.mark} prepositional
[distinctions do not rectify the]{.mark} fundamental [problem of
repetition and re-inscription. The same binary thinking that stains
ontology]{.mark} (e.g. between subject/object, free/slave, and
white/black) [lingers in the paraontological]{.mark} framework (e.g.
between blackness/ blacks, fugitivity/stagnation,
pathological/pathogenic, etc.).]{.underline} If blackness and ontology
are unavailable for one another, then blackness and paraontology are
just as unavailable and incompatible. Since, for Moten, blackness
indexes an atavistic being -- before the reign of metaphysics and
ontology, and any other organizing system for that matter -- then
no-thing is compatible with blackness. [And because [we can only
approach blackness with the instruments, grammars, and analytics of
ontology]{.mark} ('para' or otherwise), [we will never really know
blackness as Moten would desire]{.mark} -- only our metaphysical
engagement with it.]{.underline} Our desire to move beyond "ontological
Blackness" -- as Victor Anderson would describe it (cf. Anderson 1995)
-- becomes something similar to the psychoanalytic notion of objet (a)
(Lacan 2015, 12). Blackness is the imaginary wholeness or origin that we
are in constant pursuit of, but never can quite approach -- indeed, if
we successfully capture it, we die. There is, then, a certain majesty,
terror, and mysticism about blackness. Moten's brilliant work re-members
the majesty and mysticism of blackness, even if it brackets the terror
of blackness (and this, perhaps, is the job of the Afro-Pessimists, to
describe this terror). [His desire to escape ontology -- to flee it as
an existential fugitive -- expresses an impossibility that nonetheless
enlivens his texts.]{.underline}

### AT: Psychoanalysis

#### Lacks explanatory power\-\--political application is non-falsifiable

[[The problem with]{.mark} the application of [psychoanalysis]{.mark} to
social institutions [is that **there can be no testing of the claims**
]{.mark}**made**]{.underline}. [If someone says]{.underline}, for
instance, that [nationalism is a form of looking for and seeking to
replace the body of the mother one has lost]{.underline}, or that the
popular appeal of a particular kind of story echoes the pattern of our
earliest relationship to the maternal breast, [how can this be
proved]{.underline}? [The pioneers of
[psychoanalysis]{.mark}]{.underline}, from Freud onwards, all
[[derived]{.mark} their [ideas]{.mark}]{.underline} [in the context
of]{.underline} their [work **[with individual
patients]{.mark}**]{.underline} and their ideas can be examined [[in
the]{.underline}]{.mark} everyday **[[laboratory]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[of the therapeutic encounter]{.underline}]{.mark} where the validity
of an interpretation, for example, is a matter for dialogue between
therapist and patient. [Outside of the consulting room, [there can be
**no** ]{.mark}**such [verification]{.mark} process,** and [the further
one moves from the]{.mark} individual [patient]{.mark}, [the less
purchase]{.mark} psycho- analytic [ideas]{.mark} can
[have]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Outside the therapeutic encounter**,
anything and everything can be true**, psychoanalytically
speaking]{.underline}. [But if every- thing is true, then **nothing can
be false** and **therefore nothing can be true**]{.underline}. An
example of Cohen\'s method is to be found in his 1993 working paper,
\`Home rules\', subtitled \`Some reflections on racism and nation- alism
in everyday life\'. Here Cohen talks about taking a \`particular line of
thought for a walk\'. While there is nothing wrong with taking a line of
thought for a walk, such an exercise is not necessarily the same as
thinking. One of the problems with Cohen\'s approach is that a kind of
free association, mixed with deconstruction, leads not to analysis, not
even to psychoanalysis, but to . . . well, just more free association,
an endless, indeed one might say pointless, play on words. [This
approach may well throw up some interesting associations along the way,
connections one had never thought of but [it is **not to be confused
with political analysis**]{.mark}.]{.underline} In \`Home rules\',
anything and everything to do with \`home\' can and does ®nd a place
here and, as I indicated above, even the popular film Home Alone is
pressed into service as a story about \`racial\' invasion.

One key advantage of the Wendtian move, granted even by his critics (see
Flockhart, 2006), is that it simply does away with the level-of-analysis
problem altogether. If states really are persons, then we can apply
everything we know about people to understand how they behave. The study
of individual identity is not only theoretically justified but it is
warranted. [This [cohesive self]{.mark} borrowed [from **social

self']{.underline}, which is simply [an aggregate of individual
selves.]{.underline} Thus for Wendt (1999: 225) 'the state is simply a
"group Self" capable of [[group]{.mark} level
[cognition']{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet that the individual possesses a
self does not logically entail that the state possesses one too. It
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} in this leap, from the individual to the
state, that IR's **[[fallacy]{.underline}]{.mark}** of composition
[surfaces]{.underline} most clearly. Moving beyond Wendt but maintaining
the psychological self as the basis for theorizing the state Wendt's
bold ontological claim is far from having attracted unanimous support
(see nota­bly, Flockhart, 2006; Jackson, 2004; Neumann, 2004; Schiff,
2008; Wight, 2004). [One line of critique of the states-as-persons
thesis has taken shape around]{.underline} the [[resort to
**psy­chological theories**]{.mark},]{.underline} specifically, around
the respective merits of Identity Theory (Wendt) and SIT (Flockhart,
2006; Greenhill, 2008; Mercer, 2005) [[for]{.mark} understanding [state
behav­iour]{.mark}]{.underline}.9 Importantly for my argument, that the
state has a self, and that this self is pre-social, remains unquestioned
in this further entrenching of the psychological turn. Instead questions
have revolved around how this pre-social self (Wendt's 'Ego') behaves
once it encounters the other (Alter): whether, at that point (and not
before), it takes on roles prescribed by pre-existing cultures (whether
Hobbessian, Lockean or Kantian) or whether instead other, less
culturally specific, dynamics rooted in more universally human
char­acteristics better explain state interactions. SIT in particular
emphasizes the individual's basic need to belong, and it highlights the
dynamics of in-/out-group categorizations as a key determinant of
behaviour (Billig, 2004). SIT seems to have attracted increasing
interest from IR scholars, interestingly, for both critiquing
(Greenhill, 2008; Mercer, 1995) and rescuing constructivism (Flockhart,
2006). For Trine Flockart (2006: 89--91), SIT can provide constructivism
with a different basis for developing a theory of agency that steers
clear of the states-as-persons thesis while filling an important gap in
the socialization literature, which has tended to focus on norms rather
than the actors adopting them. She shows that a state's adherence to a
new norm is best understood as the act of joining a group that shares a
set of norms and val­ues, for example the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO). What SIT draws out are the benefits that accrue to
the actor from belonging to a group, namely increased self-esteem and a
clear cognitive map for categorizing other states as 'in-' or
'out-group' members and, from there, for orientating states' self--other
relationships. Whilst coming at it from a stance explicitly critical of
constructivism, for Jonathan Mercer (2005: 1995) the use of psychology
remains key to correcting the systematic evacuation of the role of
emotion and other 'non-rational' phenomena in rational choice and
behaviourist analyses, which has significantly impaired the
understanding of inter­national politics. SIT serves to draw out the
emotional component of some of the key drivers of international
politics, such as trust, reputation and even choice (Mercer, 2005:
90--95; see also Mercer, 1995). Brian Greenhill (2008) for his part uses
SIT amongst a broader array of psychological theories to analyse the
phenomenon of self--other recog­nition and, from there, to take issue
with the late Wendtian assumption that mutual recognition can provide an
adequate basis for the formation of a collective identity amongst
states. [The main problem with this psychological turn [is]{.mark}
the]{.underline} very utilitarian, almost
**[[mecha­nistic]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [approach to non-rational
phenomena]{.underline} it proposes, which tends to evacuate the role of
meaning. In other words, [it]{.underline} further [[shores up the
**pre-social**]{.mark} dimension of the concept of
**[self]{.mark}**]{.underline} that is at issue here. Indeed norms
(Flockhart, 2006), emotions (Mercer, 2005) and recognition (Greenhill,
2008) are hardly appraised as symbolic phenomena. In fact, in the
dynamics of in- versus out-group categorization emphasized by SIT,
language counts for very little. Significantly, in the design of the
original experiments upon which this approach was founded (Tajfel,
1978), whether two group members communicate at all, let alone share the
same language, is non-pertinent. It is enough that two individuals
should know (say because they have been told so in their respec­tive
languages for the purposes of the experiment) that they belong to the
same group for them to favour one another over a third individual. [The
primary determinant of individual behaviour]{.underline} thus emphasized
[is a pre-verbal, primordial desire]{.underline} to belong, which seems
closer to pack animal behaviour than to anything distinctly human. [What
the group stands for, what specific set of meanings and values binds it
together, is unimportant. What matters primarily is that the group is
valued positively]{.underline}, since posi­tive valuation is what returns
accrued self-esteem to the individual. In IR Jonathan Mercer's (2005)
account of the relationship between identity, emotion and behaviour
reads more like a series of buttons mechanically pushed in a sequence of
the sort: posi­tive identification produces emotion (such as trust),
which in turn generates specific patterns of in-/out-group
discrimination. Similarly, Trine Flockhart (2006: 96) approaches the
socializee's 'desire to belong' in terms of the psychological (and
ultimately social) benefits and the feel-good factor that accrues from
increased self-esteem. At the far opposite of Lacan, the concept of
desire here is reduced to a Benthamite type of pleasure- or
utility-maximization where mean­ing is nowhere to be seen. More telling
still is the need to downplay the role of the Other in justifying her
initial resort to SIT. For Flockhart (2006: 94), in a post-Cold War
con­text, 'identities cannot be constructed purely in relation to the
"Other"'. Perhaps so; but not if what 'the other' refers to is the
generic, dynamic scheme undergirding the very concept of identity. At
issue here is the confusion between the reference to a specific other,
for which Lacan coined the concept of *le petit autre*, and the
reference to *l'Autre*, or Other, which is that symbolic instance that
is essential to the making of *all* selves. As such it is not clear what
meaning Flockhart's (2006: 94) capitalization of the 'Other' actually
holds. The individual self as a proxy for the state's self Another way
in which [the concept of self has been]{.underline} centrally involved
in [circumventing the level-of-analysis problem]{.underline} in IR has
been to treat the self of the individual as a proxy for the self of the
state. The literature on norms in particular has highlighted the role of
individuals in orchestrating norm shifts, in both the positions of
socializer (norm entre­preneurs) and socializee. It has shown for example
how some state leaders are more sus­ceptible than others to concerns
about reputation and legitimacy and thus more amenable to being
convinced of the need to adopt a new norm, of human rights or
democratization, for example (Finnemore and Sikkink, 1998; Keck and
Sikkink, 1998; Risse, 2001). It is these specific [psychological
qualities]{.underline} pertaining to their selves (for example, those of
Gorbachev; Risse, 2001) that ultimately [enable the norm shift to
occur.]{.underline} Once again [the individual]{.underline} self
ultimately [remains]{.underline} [the basis for explaining]{.underline}
the [change in state behaviour.]{.underline} To summarize the points
made so far, [[whether the state is **literally**]{.mark} considered as
[a person]{.mark}]{.underline} by ontological overreach, whether [so
[only by analogy, or]{.mark} whether the person stands [as]{.mark} a
**[proxy]{.mark}** for the state, [the 'self']{.mark}]{.underline} of
that person [[has been]{.underline}]{.mark} consistently [[taken
as]{.mark} the **[reference]{.mark}** point for studying state
identities.]{.underline} Both in Wendt's states-as-persons thesis, and
in the broader psychological turn within constructivism and beyond, the
debate has con­sistently revolved around the need to evaluate which of
the essentialist assumptions about human nature are the most useful for
explaining state behaviour. **[[It]{.mark} has [never ques­tioned the
validity of starting from these assumptions]{.mark} in the first
place.]{.underline}** That is, [what is [left unexamined]{.mark} is this
**assumption** [is that what works for individuals **will work for
states too**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} [[This]{.mark} is IR's central
**[fallacy of composition]{.mark}**, by which it has persistently
**[eschewed]{.mark}**]{.underline} rather than resolved [[the
level-of-analysis problem]{.mark}.]{.underline} Indeed, [[in the absence
of]{.mark} a [clear dem­onstration]{.mark} of a logical
identity]{.underline} (of the type A=A) [between states and individuals,
[the assumption]{.mark} that individual interactions will explain what
states do [rests on **little more than**]{.mark} **a leap of
[faith]{.mark}**, or]{.underline} indeed an [analogy.]{.underline}

of Black economic and social hyper-vulnerability. Chanting the mantras
of \"self-help,\" \"self-reliance,\" \"self-discipline\" and \"personal

rather than liberating, emotion. (Preachers have long understood that
folks will pay good money to be released from shame.) Substantial
sections of the audience transfer their shame to the most powerless
among them, who become the repositories of all that ails Black America.¶

the Pullman Porters exemplify Self-Help in their decades of struggle for
recognition as a union - and as men? Were not the young lunch counter
integrators involved in Self-Help, as they put their bodies in danger
and their academic careers at the mercy of handkerchief-head Black
college administrators? Was the Mississippi Freedom Summer of 1964
something other than Self-Help? Who would have done it but ourselves,
and the allies we enlisted? Are the youthful Black Panther Party members
who aggressively monitored police in Oakland, California, to be expelled
from the Self-Help definition? Did scores of Party members die helping
other people than their own? Is the fight for a living wage beyond the
pale of Cosby and Co.\'s Self-Help parameters? Does the mass
demonstration at Jena, Louisiana, qualify as Self-Help?

### AT: Sexton 

#### Sexton is wrong\-\--anti-blackness as the root of all oppression is self-referential and requires ignoring mass evidence to the contrary 

**Spickard 9** (Paul Spickard, University of California, Santa Barbara,
Amalgamation Schemes: Antiblackness and the Critique of Multiracialism
(review) American Studies - Volume 50, Number 1/2, Spring/Summer 2009,
pp. 125-127)

One of the major developments in ethnic studies over the past two
decades has been the idea (and sometimes the advocacy) of
multiraciality. From a theoretical perspective, this has stemmed from a
post-structuralist attempt to deconstruct the categories created by the
European Enlightenment and its colonial enterprise around the world.
From a personal perspective, it has been driven by the life experiences
in the last half-century of a growing number of people who have and
acknowledge mixed parentage. The leading figures in this scholarly
movement are probably Maria Root and G. Reginald Daniel, but the writers
are many and include figures as eminent as Gary Nash and Randall
Kennedy. A small but dedicated group of writers has resisted this trend:
chiefly Rainier Spencer, Jon Michael Spencer, and Lewis Gordon. They
have raised no controversy, perhaps \[End Page 125\] because their books
are not well written, and perhaps because their arguments do not make a
great deal of sense. It is not that there is nothing wrong with the
literature and the people movement surrounding multiraciality. Some
writers and social activists do tend to wax rhapsodic about the glories
of intermarriage and multiracial identity as social panacea. A couple of
not-very-thoughtful activists (Charles Byrd and Susan Graham) have been
coopted by the Gingrichian right (to be fair, one must point out that
most multiracialists are on the left). And, most importantly, there is a
tension between some Black intellectuals and the multiracial idea over
the lingering fear that, for some people, adopting a multiracial
identity is a dodge to avoid being Black. If so, that might tend to sap
the strength of a monoracially-defined movement for Black community
empowerment. With Amalgamation Schemes, Jared
[[Sexton]{.underline}]{.mark} is trying to stir up some controversy. He
presents a facile, sophisticated, and theoretically informed
intelligence, and he picks a fight from the start. His title suggests
that the study of multiraciality is some kind of plot, or at the very
least an illegitimate enterprise. His tone is angry and accusatory on
every page. It is difficult to get to the grounds of his argument,
because the cloud of invective is so thick, and because his [writing [is
abstract, referential]{.mark}, and at key points
[vague]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [For Sexton]{.underline}]{.mark} (as for
the Spencers and Gordon) [[race is about Blackness]{.underline}]{.mark},
in the United States and around the world. That [is silly,
for]{.underline} **[[there are other racialized
relationships]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [In the U.S., [native peoples were
racialized by European intruders]{.mark} in all the ways that Africans
were]{.underline}, and more: [they were nearly
extinguished]{.underline}. To take just one example from many around the
world, [[Han Chinese have racialized Tibetans]{.mark} historically [in
all the ways (including slavery) that Whites have racialized
Blacks]{.mark} and Indians in the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. So [there is a problem with Sexton\'s concept of
[race as Blackness]{.mark}.]{.underline} There is also a problem with
his insistence on monoraciality. For Sexton and the others, one cannot
be mixed or multiple; one must choose ever and only to be Black. I
don\'t have a problem with that as a political choice, but [[to insist
that it is the only]{.mark} [possibility **flies in the face of a great
deal of human experience, and it ignores** ]{.mark}**the history of
[how]{.mark} modern [racial ideas emerged]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
[[Sexton does point out]{.underline}]{.mark}, as do many writers, the
[[flawed tendencies in multiracial]{.underline}
[advocacy]{.underline}]{.mark} mentioned in the second paragraph above[.
**[But he imputes them to the whole movement]{.underline}**]{.mark} and
to the subject of study, **[and that is not a fair
assessment]{.underline}**. The main problem is that **[[Sexton argues
from conclusion to evidence,]{.mark} rather than the other way
around]{.underline}**. That is, he begins with the conclusion that the
multiracial idea is bad, retrograde, and must be resisted. And then [[he
**cherry-picks his evidence** to fit his
conclusion]{.mark}.]{.underline} He spends much of his time on weaker
writers such as Gregory Stephens and Stephen Talty who have been
tangential to the multiracial literature. When he addresses stronger
figures like Daniel, Root, Nash, and Kennedy, he carefully selects his
quotes to fit his argument, and misrepresents their positions by doing
so. Sexton also makes some pretty outrageous claims. He takes the fact
that people who study multiracial identities are often studying aspects
of family life (such as the shaping of a child\'s identity), and twists
that to charge them with homophobia and nuclear family-ism. That is
simply not accurate for any of the main writers in the field. The same
is true for his argument by innuendo that scholars of multiraciality
somehow advocate mail-order bride services. And [sometimes Sexton simply
resorts to ad hominem attacks on the motives and personal lives of the
writers themselves]{.underline}. It is a pretty tawdry exercise. That is
unfortunate, because Sexton appears bright and might have written a much
better book detailing his hesitations about some tendencies in the
multiracial movement. He might even have opened up a new direction for
productive study of racial commitment amid complexity. Sexton does make
several observations that are worth thinking about, \[End Page 126\] and
surely this intellectual movement, like any other, needs to think
critically about itself. Sadly, this is not that book.

### AT: Social Death

#### Social death theory is wrong\-\--conflates the oppressors' view with the truth of black of existence, which re-centers the slave owner's perspective and prevents struggles for re-humanization

George **Lipsitz 17**. Professor of Black Studies and Sociology at the
University of California, Santa Barbara. 2017. "What is this Black in
the Black Radical Tradition?" in Futures of Black Radicalism, ed. by
Johnson and Lubin, 2017. p. 108-110.

Three miracles seem to characterize the history of Black people in the
United States. The very survival of Black people in the face of
murderous brutality and genocidal intent qualifies as a miracle. [The
enduring reality of Black humanity in a society that has used every
means at its disposal to]{.underline} destroy Black dignity and [deny
Black people]{.underline} the opportunity to exercise [their full
humanity appears miraculous. The historical record of democratic
aspiration and achievement by Black people, of creating]{.underline}
democratic [opportunities for themselves and extending them to others,
seems to defy normal rational explanations.
[Despite]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[social death]{.mark} at the center
of the slave system and]{.underline} the [organized abandonments
of]{.underline} today\'s [neoliberal capitalism, despite beatings,
lynchings, shootings, mass incarceration and systematic impoverishment,
[Black people]{.mark} have [survived]{.mark}]{.underline} and thrived.
[In slavery, African people]{.underline} in the Americas
[owned]{.underline} virtually [nothing, not even the skin on their
backs. They had every reason to give in to despair. Yet
they]{.underline} somehow [managed to survive, [to extend
recognition]{.mark}]{.underline} and respect [to each other while in
bondage, [and]{.mark} to [maintain a commitment to the **linked fate**
of all humans]{.mark}. Time and time again, Black people have
[**countered** vicious dehumanization with]{.mark} determined and
[**successful re-humanization**. Insisting on **their own humanity**
and]{.mark} the humanity [of **all people**]{.mark}, even that of their
oppressors, they have been at the forefront of]{.underline} what Dr.
King called ["the bitter but beautiful struggle" for a more just and
better world. [From]{.mark} the egalitarian politics of [abolition
democracy]{.mark} in the wake of the Civil War and the participatory
democracy of the [civil rights]{.mark} movement to the contemporary
insurgencies waged under]{.underline} the banners of
[\#[B]{.mark}lack[L]{.mark}ives[M]{.mark}atter [and]{.mark}
\#[SayHerName]{.mark}, struggles for]{.underline} Black survival and
[[Black humanity]{.mark} have]{.underline} repeatedly [[linked the
termination of]{.mark} existing [racist policies to the creation of new
democratic **practices and institutions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Forced
to cope with the nadir of political evil over centuries, Black people
have responded consistently by forging advanced concepts of a deeply
politicized love. Perhaps precisely because brutality and oppression can
make people decidedly unlovable, [African people in America have been
adept at finding ways to perceive something left to love inside
themselves and in others. [That]{.mark} ability has
[enabled]{.mark}]{.underline} their survival, [the [preservation of
their humanity]{.mark}]{.underline}, and their emergence as the
nation\'s foremost champions of democracy and social justice. The people
who were systematically denied access to the fruits and benefits of
democratic citizenship and social membership turned out to be the people
who valued democracy the most and who did the most to extend it to
others. \[END PAGE 108\] Cedric Robinson has demonstrated that the three
miracles were not really miracles at all, but rather products of a
collective intelligence developed over generations of struggle. In Black
Marxism, Robinson defines the Black Radical Tradition as "the continuing
development of a collective consciousness informed by the historical
struggles for liberation and motivated by the shared sense of obligation
to preserve the collective being, the ontological totality."1 Thus in
many ways, the greatest achievement of the Black community was itself,
its emergence as an aggrieved and insurgent polity committed to social
justice. [The "Black" in the Black Radical Tradition is a politics
rather than a pigment, a culture rather than a color]{.underline}. Yet
[this Blackness **does not presume** a unified homogenous community with
only one set of interests, needs, and desires]{.underline}. On the
contrary, Robinson\'s research reveals that [the key building blocks for
Black survival, Black humanity, and Black democracy came from the lower
rungs of Black society, from the plantations and slave quarters, out of
the contradictions of the rural regimes of slavery and debt peonage and
the living conditions in ghettos of northern and western cities.
Experience taught the Black poor and the Black working class that racial
capitalism entailed "an unacceptable standard of human
conduct"]{.underline}2 [that they needed to counter with a politics that
was]{.underline} "inventive rather than imitative, [communitarian rather
than individualistic, democratic rather than republican]{.underline},
Afro-Christian rather than secular and materialist."3 [Robinson\'s
[emphasis on political struggle]{.mark} as the main explanation for
Black]{.underline} survival, [humanity]{.underline}, and democracy
[[reminds us **not to confuse** the]{.mark} grandiose [**aspirations and
illusions** of the powerful with]{.mark} the **[actual lived
experiences]{.mark}** of those they control. [Slavery did
mandate]{.mark} legally and militarily supported [social death, but
slaves worked]{.mark} assiduously and effectively each day, every day,
each year, and every year [to create]{.mark} a **[rich social
life]{.mark}**]{.underline}.4 As Robinson argues, ["Slavery gave the lie
to its own conceit: one could not create a perfect system of oppression
and exploitation."]{.underline}5 [[Domination produces resistance,
and]{.mark} resistance [plants the]{.mark} seeds of a [new]{.mark}
society **[within]{.mark} the shell** of [the old]{.mark}]{.underline}.
As Robinson explains in Black Movements in America, \"The resistances to
slavery were the \[END PAGE 109\] principal grounds for the radically
alternative political culture that coalesced in the Black communities of
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the era of revolutionary,
liberal and nationalist impulses among Europeans in North America." 6
[[Declaring Blacks to be less than human **could not make them
so**]{.mark}, even in the eyes of their oppressors.
Research]{.underline} by John Blassingame, George Rawick, Sterling
Stuckey, Herbert Gutman, and Stephanie Camp (among others) [reveals how
[slaves fused African]{.mark} retention [and New World]{.mark} invention
[to forge a culture that **affirmed their humanity**]{.mark} and the
humanity of others]{.underline}.7 [They [recognized]{.mark}]{.underline}
this [[common humanity through]{.mark} multicultural, [multiracial
alliances with poor whites and]{.mark} others in [maroon
communities]{.mark}]{.underline}. 8 [In colonial Louisiana, Blacks
[reached out to Native Americans]{.mark} for help in [resisting
slavery]{.mark}]{.underline}.9 [Slave owners]{.underline}, however,
[were less successful in preserving their own humanity]{.underline}. In
order [to maintain the illusion of complete control, they tortured,
whipped, hanged, burned, and dismembered their \"property\" when it
displayed signs of having human will]{.underline}.10 [Black people
witnessed white people\'s inhumanity and pitied them. As early as the
1820s]{.underline}, David [Walker argued that while whites lost the
moral capacity to perceive the evil they enacted, they nonetheless knew
\"in their hearts\" that Blacks were human]{.underline}. He argued that
it was precisely this recognition that propelled their cruelty and
brutality: they presumed that Blacks resented them and, if given the
opportunity, would do to whites what whites had done to Blacks.11 [In
his history of the New Orleans slave market]{.underline}, Walter
[Johnson notes a similar loss of humanity among slave owners.
Whites]{.underline} invested more than money in the slave system; they
[looked to]{.underline} it to [elevate]{.underline} them [beyond the
status of ordinary mortals and became outraged when their chattel

Johnson notes: The greater the transformative hopes slaveholders took
with them to the slave market, the more violent their reactions to the
inevitable disappointment of their efforts to get real slaves to act
like imagined ones \... If they had to, they would use brutality to
close the distance between the roles they imagined for themselves and
the failings of the slaves they bought as props for their performance.

[An extraordinary court case followed. Collingwood died before it was
heard but the owners pursued the claim. In the first trial, they were
awarded damages in which the losses were allowed, but the interested
underwriters contested the decision]{.underline}. At an appeal hearing,
before Lord Chief Justice Mansfield, the first judgement was overturned
as it was argued that the Captain's navigational mistake could not be
termed a 'Peril of the Sea'. Despite admitting it was a 'Shocking Case',
Mansfield insisted that the 'Case of Slaves was the same as if Horses
had been thrown overboard'.21 The question was whether the jettisoning
of 133 Africans could be deemed an absolute necessity that secured the
safety of the rest of the ship, cargo and crew. As it became clear that
the Zong's water supplies were not seriously depleted, the legitimating
cause of 'necessity' could no longer be upheld.22 Thus the trial rested
on a point of insurance law even though murder cast a long shadow over
the case. Granville Sharp listened to the proceedings. He had a
transcript taken, and he wrote up an account of the details. [Thanks to
his efforts, the case of the Zong was widely publicized]{.underline}.
[Sharp viewed the case as a grotesque affront to the principle of
English liberty, demonstrating the corruption of the British legal
system by commercial interest]{.underline}. The more general propaganda
value of the case did not lodge in the question of legal justice, or
even in the fact that the case was treated simply as an insurance
dispute**[. Instead, it was the story of the massacre aboard [the
Zong]{.mark} that [became]{.mark} the [exemplary]{.mark} narrative [for
abolitionist sentiments]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [It provided an
emblematic way of highlighting the callous rapacity of slave-traders,
and the calculated murder of innocent enslaved Africans as a possible
consequence of the trade]{.underline}.23 [As it was told and retold by
central figures in the movement such as Thomas Clarkson, John Newton,
Ottobah Cugoano, and William Wilberforce, the case quickly lost its
specificity to **become an abstract anecdote illustrating the horrors of
the Middle Passage.2**]{.underline}4 Given its prominence at the time,
the case of the Zong is often cited as one of the key events that
instigated the full unleashing of the anti-slavery sentiment in Britain
which led to the formalization of the popular abolitionist campaigns in
1787. It is also often credited with having moved Parliament to pass
legislation designed to regulate slave-ship conditions in 1788.25 [While
the Zong is central to the history of abolitionism, it has also
continued to resonate within postcolonial and Black Atlantic cultural
traditions where history and memory are preserved in the recuperative
and imaginative representations of the lived trauma of slavery.26
**There is yet another way of thinking about the case**]{.underline}.
The [memory of [the]{.mark} Zong was originally secured precisely
because a sentimentalized [abolitionist narrative relied on]{.mark} the
[representation of Africans as]{.mark} innocent, and more importantly,
[passive victims]{.mark}.27 [If]{.mark} the case is [set]{.mark} with[in
a wider context of Atlantic]{.mark} maritime [resistance]{.mark},
however, [a different picture emerges]{.mark}.28 **The fact of
[resistance]{.mark} during the Middle Passage [is deeply embedded in the
genealogy]{.mark} and historical codification [of marine]{.mark}
insurance [and life insurance as]{.mark} they both came to be [mobilized
in]{.mark} the service of [the slave-trade]{.mark}.** The element that
is excessive about slavery, [in these terms]{.mark}, s not only untold,
or inassimilable**, loss. It is [the human]{.mark} [element]{.mark}
which could not, and which still [cannot, be compensated]{.mark}
precisely [because it is too predictable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [That
element is the excessive passion that escapes calculation. Simply put,
it is]{.underline} [rage. **[Africans always refused]{.mark} the
imposition of [commodity status.]{.mark}** They struggled, rebelled,
mounted insurrections, mutinied, took over ships and embraced the
outlandish freedoms of piracy.29]{.underline} [[Underwriters tried to
keep pace]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} if we go back to the history of marine
insurance it becomes clear that, in a context of violent rebellion and
disorder, they [could **never settle the uncertainty of whether slaves
were commodities or human**]{.mark} **beings**]{.underline}. [If slavery
is the most extreme and archetypal example of setting a monetary
valuation on life]{.underline} [itself, [it was in the]{.mark}
catastrophic everyday [success of the trade]{.mark} in human lives [that
the struggle to contain]{.mark} human [life financially was fought out
violently and consistently]{.mark}. While abolitionists tended to avoid
this reality, [modern insurance **bears its
legacy**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Their critique of futurity is over-stated\-\--they mistake the theoretical opening for an ontological closure\-\--refusal to engage with the specifics of institutional politics at this particular moment in history is not merely conservative but affirms the most horrifically anti-black form of political life

**Spillers 18** (Hortense, Gertrude Conaway Vanderbilt Professor of

Progressive Thought*, https://alinejournal.com/convergence/or-else/)

Ironically, however twisted a standard of measure, [[we might gauge how
far we've come by]{.mark} the degree of [doubt expressible
toward]{.mark} the efficacy of voter registration and [electoral
politics]{.mark}]{.underline}, as have a couple of my fellow writers in
this issue. Even though **[[I regard this]{.mark} argumentative [posture
as a strategic error of near-fatal proportions]{.mark}]{.underline}**, I
think I understand how we got here: basically, there are two related,
but contrastive, founding propositions on black life and thought in
modernity that critics have consistently elaborated since "time
immemorial," and by that, I mean the time that the student of history
marks down as the beginning of her sense of crisis that initiates
"blackness" in the Western context; as I understand it, Afrocentric
views, for instance, elide "blackness" and Africanity which concept is
driven back into the ancient world so that transatlantic
slavery---relatively recent in light of an ancient human past---is not
the origin---or more precisely, the prime time--- of black personality's
historical identity, but, rather, an interruption of it. The diasporic,
or (for lack of a better word) creolized reading of blackness lends
weight to the term itself, insofar as blackness on this view defines a
new historical apprenticeship, kin to Africanness, but distinct from it
in its particular and stressful formation, instaurated by the trade. One
"becomes" black --neither a phylogeny nor an ontogeny---by virtue of
his/her interpellation in total Western Economy. These portions of
discursive content imply discrete spatiotemporal registers, as the
putative subjects of each overlap, but are not entirely conformable
(even if they look exactly alike), and there's the rub. In the former
instance, one discovers as many occasions as possible to establish and
sustain symbolic contact with an imagined past, long receded, so that
emphasis comes to rest on the power and porosity of myth and its
ceremonial/ritualistic determinations wherever possible. Whether the
Afrocentric sense eventuates in a vision of strategic movement toward a
putative origin (as in "return" narratives/actualities of black politics
of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries), or of ideological movement
toward it ("ancestral" ceremonies, ritual celebrations), this reading
seems to engender a politics that is cultural, that looks
"otherworldly"---the place of the ego-ideal---in its valorized reference
to an imagined ancestral field. We would anticipate that electoral
politics in its uninspirational mundaneness might actually be beneath
it. In the latter instance, focus comes to rest on the conditions that
make blackness possible in the first place and what several diasporic
thinkers, Frantz Fanon, prominent among them, describe as
"disalienation," or the process of undoing the deleterious effects of
slavery and colonization; because the diasporic view installs the latter
as efficient cause of historic black movement, its political projects
are charged with a sense of urgency as they resonate the era of their
appearance with unmistakable identitarian markings. David Walker's, Anna
Julia Cooper's, and W.E.B.Du Bois's respective discourse, for example,
could never be mistaken for a different time/cultural period, which
means that such discourses are organically linked to their own "now."
Consequently, the political protocols of a diasporic commitment tend to
reflect the sense of crisis that characterizes blackness as an emergent
category of human possibility. Because blackness in the diasporic
reading runs parallel to modernity, blackness is cut away from the idea
of Africa---perhaps we could say more precisely that the idea of Africa
is bracketed in this ideological outline, rather than jettisoned as it
might have been a century ago---as the idea of blackness itself assumes
the name of a virtually absolute origin. If we think of these concurrent
strands of ideas as postures, then we realize the extent to which they
determine not only how one stands, but where, as well as why. This
enormous conceptual legacy, one way or another, accounts, I believe, for
the lion's share of African-American theoretical production and might be
said to proffer a rich example of the problem of being/becoming and
time. In its impressive variations and combinations, recombinations and
iterations, [black theory-making has engendered its fullest
efflorescence]{.underline} in my view [in the post-sixties
period]{.underline} with regard to both thematic variedness and
complexity and the democratic and demographic distribution of its
practitioners; [it is also true that any one of these
[postures]{.mark}]{.underline} and/or variations on it [[might
evince]{.underline}]{.mark} at any given moment a kind of
[[**intellectual sclerosis** which]{.mark} would [induce]{.mark} in turn
a [**conservative politics**.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[If]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example, [[a theory]{.mark} governed by a
diasporic view of black history from which to commence its narrative
[reifies slavery and colonization as inherent]{.mark} properties in a
subject, then [the theoretical posture no longer serves as an
intellectual technology]{.mark}]{.underline}, or a heuristic device,
[but]{.underline}, rather, [comes to advance an ontological
valence.]{.underline} In my own work, for instance, [[I]{.mark} attempt
to [advance a theory of flesh/body]{.mark} as a strategy [to
differentiate historical positionalities]{.mark} in confrontation with
the modern world. **But [if this idea has]{.mark} any [usefulness, it
proposes the theory as an opening]{.mark}**]{.underline} into a closure;
a torque that kicks off movement or rotation in static properties. [But
I [should]{.mark} hope [not]{.mark} to [lose sight of the human
potential that the subject]{.mark} of the flesh
[embodies]{.mark}]{.underline}; perhaps another way to say this is that
**[[the enfleshed subject inscribes an opening in a chain of
necessity]{.mark} rather than a last word.]{.underline}** The theory
does not exhaust the subject that it would address, but attempts to
highlight it. [[To hold]{.mark} to the view [that the enfleshed subject
is **actually chattel or property**]{.mark}---**which we cannot say**,
insofar as we have merely established a subject possibility in this
case---**[defeats the purpose]{.mark}** of discriminating in the first
place between a conceptual device on the one hand and a
speaking]{.underline} (even if barred) [subject on the
other.]{.underline} I have taken, then, the long way around in order to
say that [[the ballot does not lose efficacy when]{.mark} it is [wielded
by black personality because the latter was]{.mark} once defined
as]{.underline} anomie, as [[chattel]{.mark}.]{.underline} In other
words, **[[to premise the future of blackness on its past is to be mired
in timelessness]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which is precisely to be bereft
of historicity, of differentiation, of progression. But [moreover, [it
**confuses**]{.mark} **a [conceptual]{.mark} narrative**]{.underline},
or a position in discourse, [**[with]{.mark} an [actual
narrative]{.mark}** that will always exceed it.]{.underline} [[To
disparage the black vote is **not**]{.mark} a]{.underline}
sophisticated, or **[[radical]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [response to
anything, [**but** **reverberates**]{.mark} instead]{.underline},
without meaning to, we might suppose, [**[a long-standing hatred of
black people]{.mark}** and their aspirations. To express doubt about the
vote, especially this election s eason]{.underline}, in light of what we
face now [is beyond criticism: it is quite simply [to embrace the
inevitability of violence]{.mark}]{.underline}, and one should avoid
flirtation with violence unless she is willing to put herself in its
path. Anything less is an act of bad faith; I would go so far as to say
that **[the failure to cast a vote at the coming midterms is an immoral
act]{.underline}** for at least two reasons that might go without
saying, but bear repeating nonetheless: [[the meaning of
suffrage]{.mark} for generations of African-Americans [and]{.mark} the
[suffering]{.mark} that [it]{.mark} has [exacted]{.mark} over the
decades [and the **certain danger**]{.mark} that [the **current
presidency** and a **treasonous, complicit**]{.mark} **[Republican
congress]{.mark}ional majority** [pose to the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and the world.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Do we need to
count the ways]{.underline} that we are doubtless
threatened[?]{.underline} When I was a child, I not only spoke as one,
but imagined like a child, too---a sauce pan, for instance, turned
upside down made a really great hat---shining and irrepressible, cocked
upside the head to the left, or the right; fabulous for a stately
procession; the family's beautiful mahogany console housed a radio with
a green light in it, and if you squeezed yourself behind the device and
examined the exposed radio tubes in it, you watched as they were
suddenly dissolved in your mind's eye into the skyline of a good-size
city that you were taking in from a bird's eye-view; if you stood a mop
head up and drew a face on its handle, you had a pretty good doll for a
day, especially if your father, or a sibling, whittled down the handle.
In this world of discovery and surprise and everyday objects charged
with magic, a word like "treason" signaled a remoteness light years
away; in fact, it was a "school" word about as close to a little four-
to seven -year old black girl's reality as eighteenth-century images of
white guys in tri-cornered hats, crossing the Delaware (wherever that
was!), except that one of them was oddly named "Benedict Arnold," who
was not a very nice guy, we were told, and nowhere near "George
Washington," "who never told a lie." Somebody cut down a cherry tree
and, asked about it, 'fessed up. (Or was that Abe Lincoln?) But this
"treason" business started growing up, too, not unlike its young host
body, as its next iteration was closer in both time and space to that of
the school children---it was the Civil War and "seceding" states from
the "Union." Why would "they," including the state where our young lady
lived then and now, do that? Ah! And she learns that "history hurts."
And at that precise moment, one put away childish things, even though
Emmett Till, my contemporary, was child enough. One day, long after, the
end of a line in the presidential oath of office caught my attention, in
fact, it quite astonished me---to defend the United States against "all
enemies, foreign and domestic." But is it possible for the "enemy" to be
domestic? And what if it is? I thought I'd never live to see the day
when I would have to ask myself that question and to wonder what the
citizen's duty might be in the realization that it is not only possible,
but under certain circumstances, as appears to be the case at present,
quite likely. And [here [we are]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[faced with the
actual possibility]{.mark} now [that]{.mark} the [long-deferred
democracy we]{.mark} have [labored toward is poised to]{.mark} take a
blow that could [permanently end]{.mark} it.]{.underline} If voting
could stave it off, who would refuse? Hold that thought.

\' The **[lack of discernment in conceptualization, an overly elastic
chronology, and inattention to the significance of historical ruptures
enable Long Movement theorists to collapse the boundaries between the
Civil Rights and Black Power waves of the larger Black Liberation
Movement]{.underline}**. In her essay \"Black Freedom Stmggles,\"
Theoharis unpacks the meaning of this phrase and argues that the notion
of \"the black freedom movement\" allows scholars to get \"beyond a
dichotomy between civil rights and Black Power both ideologically and
chronologically.\" What she considers a false dichotomy has erroneously
led some scholars to view certain tactics and themes such as
self-defense, intemationalism, teaching Black History, and combating
police brutality as only Black Power concems, and to treat
desegregation, civil disobedience, and electoral politics as civil
rights issues. As many African American historians have demonstrated,
these issues have persisted across time. However, their existence during
the 1930s, 1960s, or 1980s, or that both Civil Rights and Black Power
activists challenged these forms of racial oppression, or utilized
similar tactics in doing so, does not demonstrate that \"Civil Rights\"
and \"Black Power\" were the same. Black liberals, nationalists, and
radicals have organized against the multiple forms of racial oppression
and utilized similar tactics, but that does not mean that their
conceptions of \"black freedom\" were identical. What Theoharis and
Woodard and other Long Movement advocates miss is that ideology,
discourse, and long range objectives matter as much, if not more, than
the specific inequities challenged, or the particular means employed
toward those Rather than view Civil Rights and Black Power as successive
waves of a broader BLM, differentiated by strategy and tactics,
organizations, leadership, membership, ideology, discourses, symbols and
practices. **[Long Movement advocates aggregate them into one
undifferentiated mass of characteristics]{.underline}**. Such
formulations distort the\' historical process. Timothy Tyson\'s Radio
Free Dixie: Robert F. Williams and the Roots of Black Power is an
appropriate example. **[\"The life of Robert F. Williams,\" Tyson
averred, \"illustrates that \'the civil rights movement\' and \'the
Black Power movement\' emerged from the same soil, confronted the same
predicaments, and reflected the same quest for African American
freedom.\" This]{.underline}** quote more than any other **[justifies
our deployment of the vampire analogy]{.underline}**. As historian Simon
Wendt argued, **[Tyson rendered Williams\'s thought static, and obscured
his ideological transformation from liberal to black nationalist and
ultimately to revolutionary internationalist. In arguing that Civil
Rights and Black Power grew out of the same situation, encountered the
same conditions and problematics, and embodied the same search for
freedom,]{.underline}** Tyson freezes history and blurs different
conceptualizations of black freedom. [**The [CRM was an
earthquake,]{.mark} an emption [whose seismic eruptions shattered the
legal foundation of American apartheid. It ]{.mark}**[shifted]{.mark}
the [social relations between African Americans and whites]{.mark},
transformed the black political terrain, and created new possibilities
that were seized by the advocates of Black Power. Tyson\'s analysis
sucked the life out of Williams\'s unprecedented odyssey and bled dry
the differences among the various sociohistorical contexts Williams
confronted.]{.underline}\^\^ Gloria Richardson, a militant black freedom
activist in Cambridge, Maryland, during the early 1960s, is another
example often cited by Long Movement scholars to highlight the
similarities in the strategies of Civil Rights and Black Power
campaigns. Historians Sharon Harley and Peter Levy are among several
scholars who contend that Richardson and the Cambridge Movement occupies
a liminal space between Civil Rights and Black Power. Cambridge
activists were embroiled in armed confrontations with white civilians,
police, and National Guardsmen in 1962 and 1963. Moreover, Richardson\'s
Cambridge Nonviolent Action Committee (CNAC), a heavily working-class
organization, refused to endorse a referendum on the desegregation of
local public accommodations. Arguing that African American citizenship
was not subject to a vote, Richardson and other leaders rejected the
goals of integration in favor of an emphasis on remedying economic
inequality. According to Levy, activists in Cambridge \"sour\[ed\] on
nonviolence and adopt\[ed\] a more radical posture than the mainstream
movement before black power became a national cause.\"\^\" However,
depictions of Richardson as the \"Godmother of Black Power\" are tenable
only if one assumes that civil rights campaigns in other locations were
generally unconcerned with economic justice, and commanded few working
class constituents; or that Black Power was primarily a rejection of
nonviolence. However, none of this was the case. In contrast to
descriptions of Richardson as a \"gun-toting\" heroine, historian Jenny
Walker maintained that there is no evidence that Richardson or any CNAC
members participated in armed action, or even carried weapons. Yet
Walker overstated her case in suggesting that Richardson did not diverge
dramatically from the civil rights mainstream; this overlooks her
collaboration with black nationalists such as Malcolm X. Peter Levy
ultimately concluded that if Richardson appears to be an outlier in the
standard civil rights narrative, it is in large part due to the
political and social particularity of Cambridge, Maryland, a
border-state location where African Americans had voted for generations.
There are always antecedents, precursors, and transitional individuals
and organizations in social movements, so like Robert F. Williams, the
activism of Gloria Richardson does not undermine larger categories of
\"Civil Rights\" and \"Black Power.\" Rather, the Cambridge Movement was
what civil rights campaigns looked like in a border state.\^\' As in the
case of Richardson, blurring the distinctions between Civil Rights and
Black Power is often the result of a superficial reading of movement
tactics, which are presumed to be definitive. Form is mistaken for
essence. For example, historians Timothy Tyson, Lance Hill, and others
have curiously accepted master narrative renderings of the Black Power
Movement that tend to reduce it to wild and dangerous \"Negroes with
guns.\" This is somewhat strange since this view implicitly reinforces
the conservatives\' declension narrative of Black Power as preoccupied
with \"violence.\" As Wendt, Hill, Sundiata Keita Cha-Jua, Akinyele
Umoja, and Christopher Strain have argued, armed self-defense has been a
common tactic throughout African American history. \"We now know,\"
Wendt stated in his work on clandestine African American defense units
in the South during the early 1960s, \"that armed resistance .. . played
a far more significant role in the southem civil rights stmggle than
previously thought.\" However, some such as Strain have tended to
overemphasize its centrality to civil rights campaigns, and use its
presence throughout to challenge dichotomies between pre- and post-1965
movements. For Tyson and others, knowledge of southem armed stmggle has
precipitated a reductionist logic: If the distinguishing feature of
Black Power was armed self-defense, and if African Americans practiced
this before and during the CRM, then \"Black Power\" was not a decisive
break from \"Civil Rights.\"\^\^ Reductionist definitions of Black Power
suggest the need for greater attention to the intellectual and cultural
dimensions of the BLM. That is, civil rights activists could advocate
armed militancy, just as Black Power activists could participate in
institutional politics. Nevertheless, even when their political Temporal
and Spatial Fattacies in Recent Black Freedom Studies 111 practices were
similar, they served divergent goals and objectives, and were framed
differently by the activists involved. This point was potently made by
social theorist Harold Cmse in his assessment of Robert Williams\'s
espousal of armed self-defense during his tenure as head of the Monroe,
North Carolina, NAACP. Cmse admonished: \[TJhe adoption of armed
self-defense does not, in itself, transform what was a protest movement
into a revolutionary movement\.... If Williams had, at the same time,
changed his social objective, he might have fulfilled this definition
\[as a revolutionary\]. His objective remained exactly what it was
before---desegregation. And desegregation of public facilities was also
the aim of the official NAACP leadership. Thus Williams differed not in
aims, but in tactics when he opted for armed self-defense. \^\' Wendt
also made this argument, when he rhetorically asked, \"Were the Deacons
for Defense and Justice, or similar defense units which emerged in Dixie
in the first half of the 1960s, actually the precursors, or even the
natural allies, of Black Power groups such as the Black Panther Party
for Self-Defense?\" Wendt pointed out there were \"conspicuous
differences\" between the two groups\' use of armed self-defense.
Whereas the Panthers viewed the African American situation as domestic
or \"intemal colonialism,\" which necessitated an armed revolutionary
struggle for liberation, the Deacons interpreted the African American
condition as one of \"second class citizenship\" and used armed
resistance to complement the liberal integrationist goals and the
dominant nonviolent stratagem of the civil rights struggle. In his book
on the Deacons, Lance Hill reached a similar judgment, arguing that the
Deacons did not differ ideologically in any fundamental way from the
prevailing civil rights liberal orthodoxy. Although at times Hiir
implicitly identifies Black Power in terms of armed self-defense,
ultimately he concluded that the Deacons were at best a \"bridge\"
between Civil Rights and an emerging Black Power Movement.\^\* Likewise,
both the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) and the Congress of
African Peoples (CAP) engaged in electoral politics; yet, the MFDP\'s
goals and objectives were framed in terms of liberal integrationism,
while CAP reflected the resurgent aims, objectives, and discourses of
PanAfrican nationalism. For civil rights activists, participating in
mainstream electoral politics would have meant incorporating African
Americans into the existing polity as equals; for Black Power theorists,
it often meant transforming majority-African American cities and
counties into \"liberated zones\" as a prelude to some form of
territorial or sociopolitical separation. Even the \"Modem Black
Convention Movement,\" which Komozi Woodard discussed in his book, A
Nation within a Nation, was the product of a distinctive late 1960s
black nationalist mindset. Clearly, the theoretical and ideological
lenses through which people viewed their actions matters as much as what
they actually did.\^\^ 278 The Joumai of African American History
Granted, a number of Long Movement historians reject Tyson\'s collapsing
of Civil Rights and Black Power, and oppose Hall\'s subsuming Black
Power under Civil Rights. Historians Stephen Ward, Barbara Ransby,
Jeffrey O. G. Ogbar, Bettye Collier-Thomas, and V. P. Franklin are among
the scholars who argue that Civil Rights and Black Power were
interrelated, yet distinct waves of black activism. Peniel Joseph, a
major proponent of the emerging subfield of \"Black Power Studies,\" has
gone in the opposite direction from Hall. While Joseph has generally
supported the 1954/55-1975 framework for the Civil Rights and Black
Power eras, in the article \"Black Liberation Without Apology,\" he
nevertheless locates the \"first stage\" of Black Power within the 1950s
during the Cold War. Here, Black Power, rather than Civil Rights, is
expanded to challenge the standard periodization. Among others.
**[Countryman]{.underline}**, Yohuru **[Williams]{.underline}**, and
Winston A. **[Grady-Willis]{.underline}** have **[portrayed Black Power
as a \"creative outgrowth\" of earlier civil rights efforts. Indeed, the
social and political terrain encountered by Black Power activists was
very different from that confronted by civil rights workers, in large
part due to that movement\'s qualified success]{.underline}**. The U.S.
Supreme Court\'s 1954 **[[Brown v. Board]{.underline}]{.mark}** of
Education decision, the 1964 **[[Civil Rights]{.mark}
Act]{.underline}**, the 1965 **[[Voting Rights]{.mark}
Act]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} the 1968 **[[Fair Housing]{.mark} Act,
and]{.underline}** the **[[Johnson]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[Administration\'s [War on Poverty programs significantly altered the
legal, social, and political landscapes]{.mark} for African
Americans]{.underline}**. As a result of the CRM, [**African Americans\'
[quality of life dramatically improved]{.mark} between 1960 and 1970.
For example, [the unemployment rate]{.mark} for African American men**
[decreased]{.mark} from 9.6 percent in 1960 to 5.6 percent in 1970. **In
1959 the African American** [median family income]{.mark} was 52 percent
that of white families; by 1969, it [had risen]{.mark} to 61 percent.
These [advances cleared the ground for Black Power projects to focus on
**building alternative institutions**]{.mark}**, rather than gaining
access to existing institutions, and electing African American
officials, rather than merely acquiring the vote. A host of new
organizations emerged**]{.underline}, and existing civil rights
organizations such as the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), the
Southem Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and SNCC, reflecting the
changing landscape, underwent substantive transformation, lost members
to younger formations, became stagnant, or in too many cases, dissolved.
With local grassroots organizations, such transmutations may have been
even more dramatic. **[While \"freedom\" may have been the consistent
goal in each case, the meanings of \"freedom\" and its articulations
reflected the specificities of particular historical
moments]{.underline}**. Indeed, just as \"Negro\" gave way to \"black,\"
\"**[freedom\" gave way to \"liberation\" in the era\'s
lexicon.]{.underline}**

government.\" [For]{.underline} some on [the right]{.underline}, [big
government is bad because it aims to distribute wealth to those who are
lazy and undeserving]{.underline}. [\"Big government\" is just a
shorthand for dreaded entitlement programs-all too often coded language
for race]{.underline}. In this view, [\"big government\" is the primary
agent of enforcing racial equality]{.underline}, taking hard-earned
stuff from white Americans and giving it to undeserving others.
Government cannot do such a thing, they argue, without infringing on the
rights of white Americans. And even government-mandated redistribution
will not solve the problem. As Barry [Goldwater put the point in 1964,
\"No matter how we try, we cannot pass a law that will make you like me
or me like you. The key to racial and religious tolerance lies not in
laws alone but, ultimately, in the hearts of men.\"]{.underline} From
this perspective, government plays no role in changing our racial
habits. Why would we want to make it bigger? [But Goldwater failed to
realize that governmental indifference can harden hearts, and government
action can create conditions that soften them]{.underline}.
**[[People\'s attitudes]{.mark} aren\'t static or
untouchable]{.underline}**. [They [are molded by]{.mark} the quality of
[interactions]{.mark} with others, and **[one of the great powers of
government involves]{.mark} shaping those interactions-not determining
them in any concrete sense, but [defining the parameters within]{.mark}
which [people come to know each other]{.mark} and live
together**]{.underline}. [Today, for example, most Americans don\'t
believe women should be confined to the home raising children, or
subjected to crude advances and sexist remarks by men]{.underline}. [The
women\'s-rights movement put pressure on the government, which in turn
passed laws that helped change some of our beliefs about
women]{.underline}. [Similarly, the relative progress of the 1960s did
not happen merely by using the blunt instruments of the
law]{.underline}. **[[Change emerged from the ways those laws, with
grassroots pressure, created new patterns of interactions, and]{.mark}
ultimately [new habits]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Neither Obama\'s
election to the presidency nor my appointment as a Princeton professor
would have happened were it not for these new patterns and
habits]{.underline}. [None of this happens overnight]{.underline}. [It
takes time and increasing vigilance to protect and secure
change]{.underline}. I was talking with a dose friend and he mentioned a
basic fact: that [we were only fifteen years removed from the passage of
the Voting Rights Act of 1965 when Ronald Reagan was elected president
and Republicans began to dismantle the gains of the black freedom
struggle]{.underline}. [[Civil rights legislation]{.mark} and the
policies of the Great Society [had just started to reshape our
interactions when]{.mark} they started to be rolled back]{.underline}.
[We barely had a chance to imagine America anew -to pursue what full
employment might look like, to let the abolition of the death penalty
settle in, to question seriously the morality of putting people in
prison cells, and to enact policies that would undo]{.underline} what
[the]{.underline} 1968 Kerner Commission described as [\"two Americas\"­
before]{.underline} the attack on \"big government\" or, more precisely,
[[the attack on racial equality was launched]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The
objective was to shrink the size of government]{.underline} (\"to starve
the beast\") [and to limit its domestic responsibilities to ensuring
economic efficiency and national defense]{.underline}. Democrats
eventually buckled, and this is the view of government, no matter who is
in office, that we have today. [It has become a kind of touchstone of
faith among most Americans that government is wasteful and should be
limited in its role-that it shouldn\'t intrude on our
lives]{.underline}. [Politicians aren\'t the only ones who hold this
view. Many Americans do, too]{.underline}. **[[Now we can\'t even
imagine serious talk]{.mark} of things like [full employment or]{.mark}
the [abolition of prisons]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} [We have to
change our view of government, especially when it comes to racial
matters.]{.underline} [Government policy ensured the vote for African
Americans and dismantled legal segregation. Policy established a social
safety net for the poor and elderly; it put in place the conditions for
the growth of our cities]{.underline}. [**All of this didn\'t happen
simply because of individual will** or thanks to some abstract idea of
America. **It was tied up with our demands and
expectations**]{.underline}. [Goldwater was wrong. So was
Reagan]{.underline}. And, in many ways, [so is Obama]{.underline}. [Our
racial habits are shaped by the kind of society in which we live, and
our government plays a big role in shaping that society]{.underline}.
[As young children, our community offers us a way of seeing the world;
it lets us know what is valuable and sacred, and what stands as virtuous
behavior and what does not]{.underline}. [When Michael Brown\'s body was
left in the street for more than four hours, it sent a dear message
about the value of black lives]{.underline}. [[When everything in our
society says that we should be less concerned about black folk, that
they are dangerous,]{.mark} that no specific policies can address their
misery, we say to our children and to everyone else that these people
are \"less than\"-that they fall outside of our moral concern. We say,
without using the word, that they are niggers]{.underline}. **[[One way
to change that view is to enact policies that suggest
otherwise]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Or, to put it another way, [to change
our view of government, we must change our demands of
government]{.underline}. [For example, for the past fifty years African
American unemployment has been twice that of white
unemployment]{.underline}. The 2013 unemployment rate for African
Americans stood at 13.1 percent, the highest annual black unemployment
rate in more than seventy years. Social scientists do not generally
agree on the causes of this trend. Some attribute it to the fact that
African Americans are typically the \"last hired and first fired.\"
Others point to changes in the nature of the economy; still others point
to overt racial discrimination in the labor market. [No matter how we
account for the numbers, the fact remains that most Americans see
double-digit black unemployment as \"normal.\" However, a large-scale,
comprehensive jobs agenda with a living wage designed to put Americans,
and explicitly African Americans, to work would go a long way toward
uprooting the racial habits that inform such a view]{.underline}. [It
would counter the nonsense that currently stands as a reason for
long-term black unemployment in public debate: black folk are lazy and
don\'t want to work]{.underline}. [**[If we hold the view that
government plays a crucial role in ensuring the public good]{.mark}**-if
we believe that all Americans, no matter their race or class, can be
vital contributors to our beloved community-**[then we reject the idea
that some populations are disposable]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [that some
people can languish in the shadows while the rest of us dance in the
light]{.underline}. [The question \'\'Am I my brother\'s or my sister\'s
keeper?\" is not just a question for the individual or a mantra to
motivate the private sector. It is a question answered in the social
arrangements that aim to secure the goods and values we most cherish as
a community]{.underline}. In other words, [we need an idea of government
that reflects the value of all Americans, not just white Americans or a
few people with a lot of money]{.underline}. [We need government
**seriously committed** to racial justice]{.underline}. As a nation, [we
can never pat ourselves on the back about racial matters. We have too
much blood on our hands. Remembering that fact-our
inheritance]{.underline}, as Wendell Berry said-[does not amount to
beating ourselves over the head, or wallowing in guilt, or trading in
race cards. Remembering our national sins serves as a check and balance
against national hubris. We\'re reminded of what we are capable of, and
our eyes are trained to see that ugliness when it rears its
head]{.underline}. [But when we disremember-when we forget about the
horrors of lynching, lose sight of how African Americans were locked
into a dual labor market because of explicit racism, or ignore how we
exported our racism around the world-we free ourselves from any sense of
accountability]{.underline}. [Concern for others and a sense of
responsibility for the whole no longer matter. Cruelty and indifference
become our calling cards]{.underline}. [We have to isolate those areas
in which long-standing trends of racial inequality short-circuit the
life chances of African Americans]{.underline}. [In addition to a jobs
agenda, **we need a comprehensive government response to the problems of
public education and mass incarceration**]{.underline}. **[And I do mean
a government response]{.underline}**. [Private interests have overrun
both areas, as privatization drives school reform]{.underline} (and the
education of our children is lost in the boisterous battles between
teachers\' unions and private interests) [and as big business makes
enormous profits from the warehousing of black and brown people in
prisons]{.underline}. Let\'s be clear: [private interests or
market-based strategies will not solve the problems we face as a country
or bring about the kind of society we need]{.underline}. [We have to
push for massive government investment in early childhood education and
in shifting the center of gravity of our society from punishment to
restorative justice]{.underline}. [We can begin to enact the latter
reform by putting an end to the practice of jailing
children]{.underline}. [Full stop]{.underline}. [We didn\'t jail
children in the past]{.underline}. [We don\'t need to now]{.underline}.
In sum, [government can help us go a long way toward uprooting racial
habits with policies that support jobs with a living wage, which would
help wipe out the historic double-digit gap between white and black
unemployment; take an expansive approach to early childhood education,
which social science research consistently says profoundly affects the
life chances of black children; and dismantle the prison-industrial
complex]{.underline}. We can no longer believe that disproportionately
locking up black men and women constitutes an answer to social ills.
**[This view of government cannot be dismissed as a naive pipe
dream]{.underline}**, [because political considerations relentlessly
attack our political imaginations and limit us to the status
quo]{.underline}. [We are told before we even open our mouths that this
particular view won\'t work or that it will never see the light of
day]{.underline}. We\'ve heard enough of that around single payer health
care reform and other progressive policies over the Obama years. **[Such
[defeatist attitudes conspire to limit our imaginations and make sure
that the world stays as it is]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [But those of us
who don\'t give a damn about the rules of the current political game
must courageously organize, advocate, and insist on the moral and
political significance of a more robust role for
government]{.underline}. [We have to change the terms of political
debate]{.underline}.

### AT: Undercommons 

#### Their strategy peters out at best and gets coopted at worst\-\--it trades off with our capacity to use debate to generate utopian imaginaries of concrete alternatives that mobilize systemic change outside the university

**Webb 18**---Senior Lecturer in Education at the University of
Sheffield (Darren, "Bolt-holes and breathing spaces in the system: On
forms of academic resistance (or, can the university be a site of
utopian possibility?)," Review of Education, Pedagogy, and Cultural
Studies, 40:2, 96-118, dml)

[[It is **easy to be seduced** by the]{.mark} language of the
[undercommons]{.mark}. **[Embodying]{.mark}** and **enacting
[it]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} however, [is **difficult**]{.mark} **indeed**.
[Being within and against the university]{.mark}, refusing the call to
order through insolent obstructive unprofessionalism, [is]{.mark}
**almost [impossible to sustain]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
Halberstam (2009, 45) describes the undercommons as "a marooned
community of outcast thinkers who refuse, resist, and renege on the
demands of rigor, excellence, and productivity." [[A
**romantic**]{.mark} and **appealing [notion]{.mark} for sure** [but
refusing]{.mark} and reneging on "the university of [excellence" will
**cost you your job**]{.mark}]{.underline}. When Moten describes
subversion as a "series of immanent upheavals" expressed through "vast
repertoires of high-frequency complaints, imperceptible frowns,
withering turns, silent sidesteps, and ever-vigilant attempts not to see
and hear" (2008, 1743), one is reminded instantly of Thomas Docherty,
disciplined and suspended for his negative vibes.7 Being with and for
the maroon community is difficult too. First of all, ["Where and how can
we find/see the Undercommons at work?"]{.underline} (Ĉiĉigoj,
Apostolou-Hölscher, and Rusham 2015, 265). [Where and how can one find
those liminal spaces of sabotage and subversion, and how does one occupy
them]{.underline} in a spirit of hapticality, study, and militant
arrhythmia that brings the utopic underground to the surface of the
fierce and urgent now? [Beautiful language, but **[how does one live
it]{.mark}**? Networks do, of course, exist]{.underline}---the
Undercommoning Collective, the Edu-Factory Collective, the International
Network for Alternative Academia, to name but a few. [These are
promising spaces for bringing together and harboring the maroons and the
fugitives. But [networks are]{.mark} **typically [short-lived]{.mark}**,
and]{.underline}---as Harney and Moten warned---[there is a danger of
**institutionalization**, of **taking institutional practices with you**
into alternative spaces "because we've **been inside so
much**"]{.underline} (Harney and Moten 2013, 148). [And so,
**predictably**, [meetings]{.mark} of the fugitives come [with
**structure**, **order**]{.mark}]{.underline}, an official agenda, and
circulated minutes. The outcasts convene in conventional academic
conferences, with parallel sessions, panels of papers, lunch breaks,
wine and nibbles (e.g., Edu-Factory 2012). [These spaces [offer **time
out**]{.mark}, **welcome respite**]{.underline}, a breathing space, a
trip abroad, [[and then one **returns to work**]{.underline}.]{.mark}
[If hapticality, the touch of the undercommons, is "a **visceral
register of experience**]{.underline} ... the feel that what is to come
is here" (Bradley 2014, 129--130), [then this seems
**elusive**]{.underline}. It is hard to detect a sense of the utopic
undercommons rising to the surface of the corporate-imperial university.
[Moten describes the call to disorder and to study as a way to "excavate
new aesthetic, political, and economic dispositions"]{.underline} (Moten
2008, 1745). [But [this notion]{.mark} of excavating [is **highly
problematic**]{.mark}. It is common within the discourse of "everyday
utopianism"]{.underline}---finding utopia in the everyday, recovering
lost or repressed transcendence in "everydayness" (Gardiner 2006)---[to
describe the process of utopian recovery in terms of **excavating**:
excavating repressed desires, submerged longings, suppressed histories,
untapped possibilities. But [the **fundamental questions of where to
dig** and **how to identify** a utopian "find" are **never adequately
addressed**]{.mark}]{.underline} (see Webb 2017). [Gardiner defines
utopia as "a series of forces, tendencies and possibilities that are
immanent in the here and now, in the pragmatic activities of everyday
life"]{.underline} (2006, 2). [But how are these forces, tendencies and
possibilities to be **identified** and **recovered**?]{.underline} [For
Harney and Moten, it is through **[study]{.mark}**, **hapticality**
[and]{.mark} **[militant arrhythmia]{.mark}**. These [are **slippy
concepts**]{.mark}, however, **[evading concrete material
referents]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} What is it to inhabit the
undercommons? Those who have written of their experiences refer to
"small acts of marronage" such as poaching resources and redeploying
them in ways at odds with the university's designs and demands (Reddy
2016, 7), or exploiting funding streams "to form cracks in the
institution that enable the Others to invade the university" (Smith,
Dyke, and Hermes 2013, 150). For Adusei-Poku (2015), the undercommons is
a space of refuge which is all about survival (2015, 4--5). We who feel
homeless in the university are forced into refuge. We gather together to
survive. [We may **gain satisfaction from small acts of marronage**, but
this is less about bringing the utopic common underground to the surface
as it is a form of "**radical escapism**"]{.underline} (Adusei-Poku
2015, 4). Benveniste (2015, v) tells us that: "The undercommons has no
set location and no return address. There is no map for entering and no
guide for staying. The only condition is a living appetite. Listen to
its hunger for difference." [[We need **more than
poetry**]{.underline}]{.mark}, however. [And we need more than a series
of minor acts of resistance]{.underline}. As Srnicek and Williams
rightly emphasize, [resistance is a **defensive**, **reactive gesture**,
**resisting against**. Resistance is **not a utopian endeavour**: "[We
**do not resist a new world into being**"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Srnicek
and Williams 2016, 47). [The undercommons, when one can find it, is a
**bolt hole**, a **place of refuge**, a **breathing space** in the
system. We need **something more**.]{.underline} The occupation Can the
occupied building operate as a site of utopian possibility within the
corporate-imperial university? Reflections on, and theorizations of, two
recent waves of occupation---"Occupied California" 2009--2010 and the UK
Occupations 2010--2011---have answered this question affirmatively. The
"occupation" should not be understood here as solely or necessarily
"student occupation." It goes without saying---though sadly so often
does need saying ---that "faculty also have a responsibility to fight
with and for students" (Smeltzer and Hearn 2015, 356). Though led by a
new historical subject, "the graduate without a future"
(Schwarz-WeinStein 2015, 11), the importance of faculty support for the
occupations was emphasized on both sides of the Atlantic (Research and
Destroy 2010, 11; Dawson 2011, 112; Holmes and R&D and Dead Labour 2011,
14; Ismail 2011, 128; Newfield and EduFactory 2011, 26). Long before
Occupy took shape in Zuccotti Park, "occupation" was being heralded as
the harbinger of a new society and a new way of being. If we return to
the notion of creating utopian spaces, the key aim for some of the
occupiers was to create communes within the university walls---to
communize space (Inoperative Committee 2011, 6).8 Communization here is
understood as a form of insurrectionary anarchism that refuses to talk
of a transition to communism, insisting instead upon the immediate
formation of zones of activity removed from exchange, money, compulsory
labor, and the impersonal domination of the commodity form (Anon 2010a,
5). As one pamphlet declared: We will take whatever measures are
necessary both to destroy this world as quickly as possible and to
create, here and now, the world we want: a world without wages, without
bosses, without borders, without states. (Anon 2010d, 34) This is a
revolutionary anarchism that takes the university campus as the site for
a practice---communization---that not only prefigures but also realizes
the vision of a free society. Heavily influenced by The Coming
Insurrection (Invisible Committee 2009), but tapping into a long
tradition of anarchist theory and practice from Hakim Bey's Temporary
Autonomous Zones (Bey 1985) to David Graeber's Direct Action (Graeber
2009), occupation becomes "the creation of a momentary opening in
capitalist time and space, a rearrangement that sketches the contours of
a new society" (Research and Destroy 2010, 11). It is "an attempt to
imagine a new kind of everyday life" (Hatherley 2011, 123). Firth (2012)
refers to these momentary openings as critical, experimental utopias:
Such utopias are ... simultaneously immanent and prefigurative. They are
immanent insofar as they allow space for the immediate expression of
desires, satisfaction of needs and also the articulation of difference
or dissent. They are prefigurative to the extent that they allow one to
practice and exemplify what one would like to see at a more
proliferative range in the future (26) The ultimate aim is for the
practice to spread beyond the campus through a dual process of
provocative rupture---the idea that insurrectionary moments can unleash
the collective imagination and stimulate an outpouring of creativity
that blows apart common sense and offers glimpses of a future world
(Gibson-Graham 2006, 51; Shukaitis and Graeber 2007, 37)---and
"contaminationism," that is, spreading by means of example (Graeber
2009, 211). It may well have been the case that communism was realized
on the campuses of Berkeley and UCL, that a momentary opening in
capitalist space/time appeared through which another world could be
glimpsed. The occupation, however---whether California, London, or
anywhere else---is likely always to remain a localized temporary
disruptive practice. A practice with utopian potency, for sure, in terms
of suspending normalized forms of discipline and opening new egalitarian
discursive spaces (Rheingans and Hollands 2013; Nişancioğlu and Pal
2016). In terms of wider systemic change, however, "small interventions
consisting of relatively non-scalable actions are highly unlikely to
ever be able to reorganise our socioeconomic system" (Srnicek and
Williams 2016, 29). What "the occupation" demonstrates more than
anything is the reality of the corporate-imperial university, as the
institutional hierarchy, backed by the carceral power of the police and
criminal justice system, inevitably disperses the occupiers---often
using militarized force---and repossesses the occupied space in a strong
assertion of its ownership rights not only to university buildings but
also to what constitutes legitimate thought and behavior within them (on
this see Docherty 2015, 90). The significance, and utopian potential,
one attaches to campus occupations depends in part upon the significance
one attaches to the university as a site of struggle. For the
Edu-Factory Collective: As was the factory, so now is the university.
Where once the factory was a paradigmatic site of struggle between
workers and capitalists, so now the university is a key space of
conflict, where the ownership of knowledge, the reproduction of the
labour force, and the creation of social and cultural stratifications
are all at stake. This is to say the university is not just another
institution subject to sovereign and governmental controls, but a
crucial site in which wider social struggles are won and lost.
(Caffentzis and Federici 2011, 26) Clearly, if this is true, then the
form the struggle takes, and the example it sets, is of immense
significance. Srnicek and Williams describe as "wishful thinking" the
idea that the occupation might spread beyond the campus by means of
rupture or contamination (2016, 35). However, if the university really
is a key site of class struggle (Seybold 2008, 120; Haiven and
Khasnabish 2014, 38), a site through which wider struggles are refracted
and won or lost, then the transformative potential of the occupation
needs to be attended to seriously. The analysis of the university
offered by the Edu-Factory Collective is, however, outdated. Sounding
like Daniel Bell writing in 1973 about how universities had become the
"axial structures" of post-industrial society (Bell 1973, 12), the
analysis does not hold water today. Moten overdoes it when he tells us
that "the university is a kind of corpse. It is dead. It's a dead
institutional body" (Moten 2015, 78). What is clear, however, is that
"focusing on the university as a site of radical transformation is a
mistake" (Holmes and R&D and Dead Labour 2011, 13). As has been widely
noted, there is very little distinguishing universities from other
for-profit corporations (Readings 1996; Lustig 2005; Washburn 2005;
Shear 2008, Tuchman 2009). What does separate them is their
inefficiency, due in large part to the fact that universities operate
also as medieval guilds, with faculties "ruled by masters who lord over
journeymen and apprentices in an artisanal system of production"
(Jemielniak and Greenwood 2015, 77). If the university is a sinister
hybrid monstrosity---part medieval guild, part criminal
corporation---which has no role other than reproducing its own
privilege, then no special status can be attributed to campus protests.
In this case, "A free university in the midst of a capitalist society is
like a reading room in a prison" (Research and Destroy 2010, 10). A
reading room in a prison. Another apposite metaphor. The occupation is a
safe space, offering temporary respite, a place to hide, a refuge, a
bolt-hole, a breathing space. As with the utopian classroom and the
undercommons, what the occupation suggests is that "defending small
bunkers of autonomy against the onslaught of capitalism is the best that
can be hoped for" (Srnicek and Williams 2016, 48). Conclusion Zaslove
was right to characterize utopian pedagogy within the corporateimperial
university as the search for bolt-holes and breathing spaces in the
system. He himself suggests that, "All university classes should become
dialogic-experiential models that educate by expanding the zones of
contact with wider communities" (2007, 102). Like so many others,
Zaslove sees dialogic-experiential models of education beginning in the
classroom then expanding outward. The literature is full of references
to "exceeding the limits of the university classroom" (Coté, Day, and de
Peuter 2007a, 325), "extend \[ing\] beyond the boundaries of the campus"
(Ruben 2000, 211), and "breeching the walls of the university compounds
and spilling into the streets" (Research and Destroy 2010, 10). This all
brings to mind Giroux's notion of academics as border crossers (Giroux
1992), but it also paints a picture of academics taking as their
starting point the university and from there crossing the border into
the community and the street. [[The University]{.mark} can be the site
for **fleeting**, **transitory**, **small-scale experiences** of utopian
possibility]{.underline}---in the classroom, the undercommons, the
occupation. [It [**cannot be the site for transformative utopian
politics**. It **cannot even be the starting point for
this**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Given the corporatization and
militarization of the university, academics are increasingly becoming
"functionaries of elite interests" inhabiting a culture which serves to
reproduce these interests (Shear 2008, 56). [[Within the
university]{.mark}, "radical" initiatives or [movements will **soon be
co**]{.mark}**-[opted]{.mark}**, **recuperated**, **commodified**, [and
**neutralized**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Gibson-Graham 2006, xxvi; Seybold
2008, 123; Neary 2012b, 249; Rolfe 2013, 21). [[Institutional habitus
**weights so heavily** that projects]{.mark} born in the university
[will be **scarred from the outset** by]{.mark} a certain [colonizing
"**imaginary of education**]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Burdick and Sandlin
2010, 117). [And]{.underline} we have long known that [[the university
is **but one space of learning**]{.mark}, and perhaps **not a very
important one** at that. Identifying the academy as the **starting
point** for a utopian pedagogy **privileges this arcane space** over
sites of **public pedagogy**]{.underline} such as film, television,
literature, sport, advertising, architecture, media in its various
forms, political organizations, religious institutions, and the
workplace (Todd 1997). Perhaps [the emphasis on **[creating radical
experimental spaces]{.mark}** within the academy [needs to **shift**
toward operating in]{.mark} **existing spaces of resistance [outside
it]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Haiven and Khasnabish argue that [many social
[movements **function**]{.mark} **already** [as]{.mark} "**social
[lab]{.mark}oratorie[s]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} the generation of
**[alternative relationships]{.mark}**, **subjectivities**,
**institutions** and **practices**"]{.underline} (2014, 62), [providing
"a **space for experiments** in]{.underline} knowledge production,
**[radical imagination]{.underline}**, subjectification, [and **concrete
alternative-building**"]{.underline} (Khasnabish 2012, 237). Why locate
utopian pedagogy in the university when "critical utopian politics" can
take place in "infrastructures of resistance" such as intentional
communities, housing collectives, squats, art centers, community
theatres, bars, book shops, health collectives, social centers,
independent media and, increasingly of course, the digital sphere (Firth
2012; Shantz 2012; Amsler 2015; Dallyn, Marinetto, and Cederstrom 2015)?
[Moving **beyond short-term**, **localized**, **temporary modes** of
resistance, utopian pedagogy would **work across these sites** to
develop a **long-term strategy** and **vision**. There is a **role for
the academic** in utopian politics, but **not in the
university-as-such**. The utopian pedagogue has a **responsibility**
to]{.underline} exploit their own privilege and to [work
with]{.underline} students, communities and [movements **outside** and
**divorced from the university**]{.underline}. As Shear rightly notes,
academics (and especially those working in the humanities and social
sciences) "inhabit a privileged space in which [critical
inquiry]{.underline} concerning social hegemony and political-economic
domination" [is **possible**]{.underline} (Shear 2008, 56). [Within the
university, however, spaces for **embodying** and **enacting** this kind
of inquiry have become **constrained**, **compromised**, **monitored**,
**surveilled**, **co-opted**, and **recuperated**]{.underline}. As I
have argued throughout this article, [utopian pedagogy has become a
**search for bolt-holes** and **breathing spaces** in the system.
**[Beyond the academy]{.mark}**, however, there is a **role to
play**]{.underline}. As Chomsky (2010) tells us, [with privilege comes
responsibility]{.underline}. And as Giroux frames it, [this is [an
**ethical** and **political responsibility** to provide

### AT: Wilderson 8

#### Not even close to applicable\-\--this article is just a long complaint about some asshole in the Cabrillo Student Senate and how he didn't give money to Black folks to travel to a conference\-\--extrapolating that to ALL topical debate is ridiculous

**Wilderson 8** (2008, Frank B., Incognegro: A Memoir of Exile and
Apartheid South End Press, pg. 406-411)

Just two years ago, in December of 1999, I\'d written a letter and
stuffed it, late one night, in the faculty mailboxes. It began with what
must have appeared to the faculty\'s confused eyes as a red herring. It
spoke not about my excruciating encounters with them, but began,
instead, out of left field by discussing the plight of two students
whose troubles with the College had been the topic of recent debate.
**[[Reading]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} Sonia
Rodriguez\'s and Selma Thornton\'s [[troubles with the Student
Senate]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and its White liberal adviser Tim
Harold]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[reawakened my disdain for
Cabrillo]{.mark} as an institution and for the English Division as one
of its flagship entities]{.underline}**. I then went on to explain how
[[Selma and Sonia had resigned their posts]{.mark} in the Student Senate
[in protest over Harold\'s decision not to allow thirty students of
color to have funds to travel to a conference on race]{.mark} at
Hartnell College. Instead, [Harold spent the money on
T-shirts]{.mark}]{.underline}. He had also put the sign-up sheet for the
conference not in the Student Center, but in some obscure location where
it would never be found thus sabotaging the excursion further. This
seemed like a trivial enough matter, but it compounded the hurt and
sense of isolation and rebuke which so many Black and Latino students
felt at Cabrillo but could not name. I felt a piqued kinship with their
unspeakable pain and used the rare moment of it having turned into a
tangible event as a way into what I wanted to say to the faculty and
administration\...and to Alice. In defense of his actions, and as a way
of indicating the absurdity of Selma and Sonia\'s objections, Harold
issued a public statement in which he did not comment (or at least the
newspaper did not report his comments) on his funding priorities;
rather, he simply said \"The sign-up sheet was posted for a week, the
same way we treat any workshop.\" To this, I wrote: Whereas Selma
Thornton attempts an institutional analysis of the Student Senate by way
of a critique of Tim Harold and his practices, Harold responds with [a
ready made institutional defense]{.underline} and, later in the article,
a defense of his integrity (a personalized response to an institutional
analysis). He [brings the scale of abstraction back down to the level
most comfortable for White people]{.underline}: the individual and
[the]{.underline} uncontextualized [realm of fair play. It\'s the White
person\'s safety zone.]{.underline} I\'m a good person, I\'m a fair
person, I treat everyone equally, [the rules apply to
everyone]{.underline}. Thornton and Rodriguez\'s comments don\'t indict
Harold for being a \"good\" person, they indict him for being White:
**[a way of being in the world which legitimates institutional
practices]{.underline}** (practices which Thornton and Rodriguez object
to) accepts, and promotes, them as timeless---without origin,
consequence, interest, or allegiance---natural and inevitable. \"The
sign-up sheet was posted for a week, the same way we treat any
workshop.\" [The]{.underline} whole [idea that we treat everyone equally
is]{.underline} only slightly more [odious]{.underline} than the
discussion or how we can treat everyone equally; because the problem is
neither the practice nor the debates surrounding it, but the fact that
White people can come together and wield enough institutional power to
constitute a \"We.\" \"We\" in the Student Senate, \"We\" in Aptos,
\"We\" in Santa Cruz, \"We\" in the English department, \"We\" in the
boardrooms. [\"We\" are fair and balanced is as odious as \"We\" are in
control---they are derivations of the same expression: \"We\" are the
police. The claim of \"balance and fair play\" forecloses
upon]{.underline}, not only [the modest argument that the practices of
the Cabrillo Student Senate are racist]{.underline} and illegitimate,
[but]{.underline} it [also]{.underline} forecloses upon
[the]{.underline} more extended, comprehensive, and [antagonistic
argument that Cabrillo itself is racist]{.underline} and illegitimate.
And [what do we mean by Cabrillo? The White people who constitute its
fantasies of pleasure and its discourse of legitimacy]{.underline}. The
generous \"We.\" So, let\'s bust \"We\" wide open and start at the end:
White people are guilty until proven innocent. Fuck the compositional
moves of substantiation and supporting evidence: I was at a conference
in West Oakland last week where a thousand Black folks substantiated it
a thousand different ways. You\'re free to go to West Oakland, find
them, talk to them, get all the proof you need. You can drive three
hours to the mountains, so you sure as hell can cut the time in half and
drive to the inner city. Knock on any door. Anyone who knows 20 to 30
Black folks, intimately---and if you don\'t know 12 then you\'re not
living in America, you\'re living in White America---knows the statement
to be true. White people are guilty until proven innocent. [Whites are
guilty of]{.underline} being friends with each other, of standing up for
their rights, of pledging allegiance to the flag, of [reproducing
concepts like fairness]{.underline}, meritocracy, balance, standards,
norms, harmony between the races. Most of all. [Whites are guilty of
wanting stability and reform. White people,]{.underline} like Mr. Harold
and those in the English Division, [are guilty of asking themselves the
question. How can we maintain the maximum amount of order]{.underline}
(liberals at Cabrillo use euphemisms like peace, harmony, stability),
[with the minimum amount of change, while presenting
ourselves]{.underline}---if but only to ourselves---[as having the best
of all possible intentions.]{.underline} Good people. Good intentions.
White people are the only species, human or otherwise, capable of
transforming the dross of good intentions into the gold of grand
intentions, and naming it \"change.\" \...[These passive revolutions,
**fire and brimstone conflicts over which institutional reform is better
than the other one, provide a smoke screen**]{.underline}---a
diversionary play of interlocutions---that keep real and necessary
antagonisms at bay. [White people are thus able to go home each
night,]{.underline} perhaps a little wounded, but [feeling better for
having made Cabrillo a better place\...for everyone]{.underline}\...
Before such hubris at high places makes us all a little too giddy, let
me offer a cautionary note: it\'s scientifically impossible to
manufacture shinola out of shit. But White liberals keep on trying and
end up spending a lifetime not knowing shit from shinola. [Because White
people]{.underline} love their jobs, they [love their
institutions]{.underline}, they love their country, most of all they
love each other. And [every Black or Brown body that doesn\'t love the
things you love is a threat to]{.underline} your love for each other. A
threat to [your fantasy space, your terrain of shared
pleasures.]{.underline} Passive revolutions have a way of incorporating
Black and Brown bodies to either term of the debate. What choice does
one have? The third (possible, but always unspoken) term of the debate,
**[White people are guilty of structuring debates which reproduce the
institution and the institution reproduces America]{.underline}** and
America is always and everywhere a bad thing this term is never on the
table, because the level of abstraction is too high for White liberals.
They\'ve got too much at stake: their friends, their family, their way
of life. Let\'s keep it all at eye level, where whites can keep an eye
on everything. [So the Black body is incorporated]{.underline}. Because
to be unincorporated is to say that what White liberals find valuable I
have no use for. This, of course, is anti-institutional and shows a lack
of breeding, not to mention a lack of gratitude for all the noblesse
oblige which has been extended to the person of color to begin with.
\"[We will incorporate colored folks into our fold, whenever possible
and at our own pace, provided they\'re team players]{.underline}, speak
highly of us, pretend to care what we\'re thinking, are highly
qualified, blah, blah, blah\...but, and this is key, [we won\'t
entertain the rancor which **shits on our fantasy space**. We\'ve killed
too many Indians, worked too many Chinese and Chicano fingers to the
bone, set in motion the incarcerated genocide of too many Black folks,
and we\'ve spent too much time]{.underline} at the beach, or in our
gardens, or hiking in the woods, or [patting each other on the literary
back]{.underline}, or teaching Shakespeare and the Greeks, or drinking
together to honor our dead at retirement parties (\"Hell, Jerry White
let\'s throw a party for Joe White and Jane White who gave Cabrillo the
best White years of their silly White lives, that we might all continue
to do the same White thing.\" \"Sounds good to me, Jack White. Say,
you\'re a genius! Did you think of this party idea all on your own?\"
\"No, Jerry White, we\'ve been doing it for years, makes us feel
important. Without these parties we might actually be confronted by our
political impotence, our collective spinelessness, our insatiable
appetite for gossip and administrative minutia, our fear of a Black
Nation, our lack of will.\" \"Whew! Jack White, we sound pathetic. We\'d
better throw that party pronto!\" \"White you are, Jerry.\" \"Jack
White, you old fart, you, you\'re still a genius, heh, heh, heh.\") [too
much time White-bonding in an effort to forget how hard we killed and to
forget how many bones we walk across each day just to get from our
bedrooms to Cabrillo\...too, too much for one of you coloreds to come in
here and be so ungrateful as to tell us the very terms of our precious
debates are specious.\" But specious they are]{.underline}, as evidenced
by recent uproar in the Adjunct vs. Minority Hire debates, or whether or
not English 100 students should be \"normed.\" [**The very terms of the
debates suture discussions around White entitlement, when White
entitlement is an odious idea**.]{.underline} Whites are entitled to
betray other Whites, nothing else\... Beyond that you\'re not entitled
to anything. So how could you possibly be entitled to a job? How could
you possibly be entitled to decide who should pass and who should fail?
How could you possibly be entitled to determining where the sign-up
sheet for Diversity Day buses will or will not be placed, and how funds
should be allocated? Okay\...so some of you want to hire a \"minority\"
as long as s/he\'s \"well mannered and won\'t stab us in the back after
s/he\'s in our sacred house;\" and some of you want to hire an adjunct
(Jill or Jeffery White) because, \"What the hell---they\'ve been around
as long as Jack, Joe, Jerry, and Jane White, and shucks fair is fair,
especially if you\'re entitled.\" And entitlement is a synonym for
Whiteness. But there\'s only one job, because for years you\'ve
complained about the gate, while breathing collective (meaning White)
sighs of relief that it was there to protect you from the hordes.
(Somewhere down the street in Watsonville an immigrant is deciding
whether to give his daughter or his wife up for the boss to fuck that he
might have a job picking your fruit. [Somewhere up the road in Oakland a
teen is going to San Quentin for writing graffiti on a wall. And you\'re
in here trying to be \"fair\" to each other, while promoting
diversity---whatever that means.]{.underline} By the time you\'ve
arrived at a compromise over norming or faculty hires---your efforts to
\"enlighten\" whoever doesn\'t die in the fields or fall from the earth
into prison---the sista has been raped and the brotha busted. But then
you\'ve had a difficult day as well.) So, do what you always do. Hire
the most qualified candidate. Here are some questions and guidelines to
speed the search committee on its way and make everyone feel entitled.

### AT: Yancy 

#### There is no view from nowhere, and our argument is the opposite of it\-\--all knowledge is social, rooted in lived relationships\-\--but phenomenalist accounts of the world are insufficient. 

**Ferguson 15** (Stephen C., Assoc. Prof. in Liberal Studies @ North
Carolina A & T State U., *Philosophy of African American Studies:
Nothing Left of Blackness*, pp. 182-186)

The perspective that experience is sui generis of theory is a
philosophical error rooted in empiricism. ([The timeworn -- yet popular
-- view that \"I lived it so I know it\" is an expression of vulgar
empiricism.]{.underline}) Here [Collins identifies social experience
with theoretical reflection]{.underline}, wherein sociology of knowledge
is identified with knowledge proper. [The [social context of knowledge
is important]{.mark}]{.underline}; for a materialist analysis, it
provides a means for uncovering the objective, material conditions for
the genesis of certain forms of thinking and action. [[However]{.mark},
a description of immediate social experience is]{.underline} only, [at
best]{.underline}, [phenomenalist and [does not]{.mark}
[disclose]{.mark} the underlying [essential social
relations]{.mark}]{.underline} giving rise to immediate experience. A
scientific, that is, materialist, epistemology requires the mediation of
theory, in order to understand our immediate social experience.
**[[Our]{.mark} immediate [experience will not disclose]{.mark} that the
Sun is the center of our universe or the [existence of subatomic
particles]{.mark}.]{.underline}**¶ [The weakness of
empiricism]{.underline} (and positivism as a form of empiricism) [is
that it begins with the legitimate notion that knowledge starts with
experience and comes to the more general conclusion that knowledge is
limited to experience.]{.underline} **[My critique of empiricism should
not be seen as the rejection]{.underline}** of what is a legitimate
pursuit in AAS, that is, the undertaking **[of empirical
science]{.underline}** -- both in their natural/physical and social
forms. Rather, it is a critique of empiricism. Empiricism is not
identical to engaging in empirical work. [Just as living under
capitalism does not necessarily make one a capitalist, engaging in
empirical research does not necessarily make one an
empiricist.]{.underline}¶ Let me offer the following example to further
make my point. [After a number of years, **a worker** in a factory
**would in all probability have a rich storehouse of**]{.underline}
(immediate) [**experiences concerning** the working of **the factory**.
Yet,]{.underline} [by virtue of these (immediate) experiences in a
factory, **the same worker would not of necessity have a critical
comprehension of capitalist political economy.**]{.underline}99 To
conflate the sociology of knowledge and epistemology is to confuse the
genesis of thought with its validity and veracity. Epistemology is
distinct from the sociology of knowledge. It is concerned with the
nature of knowledge or understanding what is the substance (content) of
knowledge. It is concerned with the justification of beliefs and what
constitutes truth. 100¶ [The [conflation of epistemology with]{.mark}
the [sociology of knowledge]{.mark} often [leads to]{.mark} a [reduction
ad absurdum]{.mark}]{.underline}, namely, [the validity and veracity of
a given idea]{.underline}, or body of thought [turns entirely on the
social origins]{.underline} or sources [of knowledge.]{.underline} This
reduction is no more than the expression of a genetic fallacy. **[This
[fallacy is pervasive among those]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in AAS,
**[[who]{.mark} desire to [affirm that which is]{.mark}]{.underline}**
African/**[[Black and negate]{.mark} that which is]{.underline}**
European/**[[white on]{.mark} the [basis of]{.mark} their respective
points of]{.underline}** social origin or **[\"[social
situatedness]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}**¶ In fact, **[[being]{.mark} a
member of [a \"subjugated group\" does]{.mark} [not mean]{.mark} that
[you will interpret reality differently from]{.mark} that of the
hegemonic dominant [ruling class]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The so-called
[Reagan Democrats refers to traditionally Democratic
voters]{.underline}, particularly white working-class Northerners, [who
defected from the Democratic Party and]{.underline}, in turn, [supported
Republican presidential candidates]{.underline} in 1980, 1984, and 1988
elections in the United States. [The turn to the right by \"Reagan
Democrats\" was greatly influenced by bourgeois ideology]{.underline} in
the form of Nixon\'s concept of the \"Silent Majority,\" television
shows such as All in the Family and the overall structural crisis of
capitalism in the late 1970s. 101¶ [It is important to highlight that,
in any class-divided society, the ruling ideology is the ideology of the
ruling class.]{.underline} Proletarian consent to the ruling ideas is in
substance the subordination of objective proletarian interests to
bourgeois ideology. This contradiction in objective conditions as
reflected in subjective consciousness is directly manifested as
proletarian false consciousness. 10\"- So, [given the influence of white
supremacist ideology, [all white workers are not inherently
racist]{.mark}]{.underline} in the sense of being active and organized
proponents of racist ideology. Despite this fact, [I would be remiss if
I overlooked the fact that racist ideology has a definite influence on
the social psychology of white workers]{.underline}, leading to certain
beliefs, customs, and traditions as well as to spontaneous actions that
are obstacles to class solidarity and the development of class
consciousness and, yet, shared by the ruling class.¶ **[A [clear
example]{.mark} of this [is]{.mark} the tragic [Vincent Chin
incident]{.mark}.]{.underline}** On June 19, 1982, in Detroit, Michigan,
Vincent Chin, a Chinese-American draftsman, was killed by two unemployed
Euro-American autoworkers -- Ronald Ebens and Michael Nitz. Before
bludgeoning him to death with a baseball bat, they reportedly screamed
racial obscenities and believing him to be Japanese blamed him for
layoffs in the automobile industry. 105 [[Rather than see]{.mark}
increasing [unemployment as a structural contradiction of monopoly
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}, resulting primarily from the trade and
investment rivalry between United States and Japanese firms, auto
workers such as Ronald [[Ebens and]{.underline}]{.mark} Michael [[Nitz
place]{.mark} the [blame on]{.mark} some [\"Yellow
Menace\"]{.mark}]{.underline} taking jobs from American workers.
**[[Their]{.mark} immediate social [experiences]{.mark} of the world
[obscured their perception]{.mark} of the objective
world.]{.underline}**¶ [The origins of standpoint epistemology can be
found in the empiricist errors of]{.underline} Gyorgy Lukacs\'s work
History and Class Consciousness, particularly in his discussion of
[class-consciousness and the \"standpoint of the
proletariat.\"]{.underline} For Lukacs, the shared collective
consciousness of the proletariat becomes the basis for their designation
as the gravediggers of capitalism by Marx. Lukacs observes: \"Only the
consciousness of the proletariat can point to he way that leads out of
the impasse of capitalism."104 [In a parallel move, standpoint
epistemology gives \"epistemological priority\" to the
\"phenomenological experience of a specific
collecrivity.\"]{.underline}105 As such, epistemology passes over into
the sociology of knowledge. However, as Terry Eagleton astutely notes:¶
For [it is not in the first place the consciousness of the
working-class]{.underline}, actual or potential, [which leads Marxism to
select it as the prime agency of revolutionary change.]{.underline} If
the working-class figures as such an agent, it is for structural.
material reasons -- the fact that it is the only body so located within
the productive process of capitalism, so trained and organized by that
process and utterly indispensable to it, as to be capable of taking it
over. In this sense it is capitalism, nor Marxism, which \"selects\" the
instruments of revolutionary overthrow, patiently nurturing its own
potential gravedigger. 11\"1¶ [There are \"structural, material
reasons\" for]{.underline} Marx and Engels [designating the
working-class as the \"prime agency of revolutionary
change.\"]{.underline} In contrast, [feminist and critical race
theorists have found]{.underline} in Lukacs\'s framework [a critical
standpoint from which to articulate forms of oppositional political
subjectivity that no longer privilege the proletariat as \"the identical
subject-object of history.\"]{.underline} Consequently, **[we are left
with communities that speak a different language and]{.underline}**,
ultimately, **["incommensurable communities across which rational
discourse is impossible."]{.underline}**107¶ If all knowledge claims are
partisan and partial, then it logically follows that all knowledge
claims arc equally valid. The obvious problem for Collins\'s relativism
is the following: if all viewpoints or \"situated knowledges\'\' are
equally valid, then there seems to be no reason why hegemonic
perspectives (by white racist and sexist males) should be thrown out of
the intellectual marketplace. [Collins provides us with the view that
[reality is always subject to different
descriptions]{.mark}]{.underline} or interpretations. [There
are]{.underline} as [many valid \"true\" descriptions]{.underline} of
the world as there are \"language-games,\" \"forms of life,\" or
\"cultural communities\" in existence. Ultimately, our standpoint or
\"social situatedness\" becomes the final arbitrator in all conflicts or
disagreements, whether epistemological, political, social, economic, or
aesthetic. We should take note of the following commentary by Andrew
Sayer:¶ [[To note that a]{.mark} particular kind of
[knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline} comes from a particular culture or [[is
associated with a particular]{.mark} subject [position, does not
entail]{.mark} that [it]{.mark} is valid for or [applies only to those
who belong]{.mark} to the same originating social group.]{.underline}
**[Acupuncture is Chinese]{.underline}** in origin **[but it
can]{.underline}** also **[work on non-Chinese people, just as [Western
medicine can work on non-Western people]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Similarly, [French social theory cannot be discounted as only applicable
within France!]{.underline} To be sure, **[[there is no view from
nowhere]{.mark} -- all knowledge is social]{.underline}**, situated, and
contextual. **[But it does not follow from this that truth claims can
only be applicable to the particular group who propose
them.]{.underline}**108¶ [From the standpoint of Collins\'s]{.underline}
Afrocentric feminist [epistemology,]{.underline} both [race and gender
take on the power of epistemology and]{.underline}, consequently, [make
the rules for valid arguments.]{.underline} The problem with
\"malestream\" social science is not merely that it is a masculine or
Eurocentric view. Rather, the heart of the problem is that it does not
offer a true, approximate reflection of the way the world is.

### Death Bad 

#### Death is bad -- destroys the subject ontologically and precludes possibilities for improvement

**Paterson, 03** -- Department of Philosophy, Providence College, Rhode
Island (Craig, "A Life Not Worth Living?", Studies in Christian Ethics,
<http://sce.sagepub.com>)

Contrary to those accounts, I would argue that it is death per se that
is really the objective evil for us, not because it deprives us of a
prospective future of overall good judged better than the alter- native
of non-being. It cannot be about harm to a former person who has ceased
to exist, for no person actually suffers from the sub-sequent
non-participation. Rather, [**[death]{.mark}** in itself **[is]{.mark}**
an **[evil]{.mark}** to us [because it **ontologically destroys
the**]{.mark} current existent [subject]{.mark}]{.underline} --- it is
the ultimate in metaphysical lightening strikes.80 [The evil of death is
truly an ontological evil borne by the person who already exists,
**[independent]{.mark}**ly [**of** **calculations about** **better**
**or** **worse**]{.mark} possible **[lives]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Such
an evil need not be consciously experienced in order to be an evil for
the kind of being a human person is. [[Death is]{.mark} an [evil
because]{.mark} of the change in kind [it brings about, a change that is
destructive of the]{.mark} type of [entity that we]{.mark} essentially
[are]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Anything,]{.underline} whether caused
naturally or caused by human intervention (intentional or unintentional)
[that drastically interferes in the process of maintaining the person in
existence is an objective evil for the person]{.underline}. What is
crucially at stake here, and is dialectically supportive of the
self-evidency of the basic good of human life, is that death is a
radical interference with the current life process of the kind of being
that we are. In consequence, death itself can be credibly thought of as
a 'primitive evil' for all persons, regardless of the extent to which
they are currently or prospectively capable of participating in a full
array of the goods of life.81 In conclusion, concerning willed human
actions, [it is justifiable to state that any intentional [rejection
of]{.mark} human [life]{.mark} itself [cannot]{.mark} therefore [be
warranted since it is an **expression of an ultimate disvalue**]{.mark}
for the subject]{.underline}, [namely, the destruction of the present
person; a radical ontological good that we cannot begin to weigh
objectively against the travails of life in a rational
manner.]{.underline} [To deal with the sources of disvalue]{.underline}
(pain, suffering, etc.) [[we should not seek to]{.mark} irrationally
[**destroy**]{.mark} the person, **[the very source]{.mark}** and
condition **[of all human possibility]{.mark}**]{.underline}.82

### Alt Fails 

#### The alt is net worse -- it legitimizes violence -- war is the primary tool for Bataille's attack on the status quo.

**Wolin 96** (Richard, Professor of Modern European Intellectual History
and Humanities at Rice University, Constellations, Volume 2, No 3, "Left
Fascism: Georges Bataille and the German Ideology," p. 404-405)

Moreover, the cultural attitudes of both Spengler and Bataille are
linked by an aesthetics of violence that is highly characteristic of the
"front generation." In a key passage in The Decline of the West,
Spengler, depicting the "life-world" of blood and instinct that had been
repressed by the Faustian spirit of modernity, observes: "War is the
primary politics of everything that lives and so much so that in the
depths battle and life are one, and being and will-to-battle expire
together."2' Similarly, for Junger, "War is an intoxication beyond all
bonds. It is a frenzy without cautions and limits, comparable only to
the forces of nature."29 Bataille (the meaning of his name in French
should be recalled), too, is convinced, that "conflict is life. Man's
value depends upon his aggressive strength. A living man regards death
as the fulfillment of life; he does not see it as a misfortune. . , , I
MYSELF AM WAR."30 As Jay observes in this connection: "on a [deeper
level, the war \[World War I\] seems to have exercised a certain
positive fascination \[on Bataille\]. For it is striking that many of
[Bataille's]{.mark} obsessive [themes]{.mark} would [betray an affinity
for]{.mark} the experiences of [degradation, pollution, violence]{.mark}
and communal bonding that were characteristic of life in the trenches."
In the worldview of both Bataille and that of German young
conservatives, [war plays an essential]{.mark}, positive [role]{.mark}.
[It serves as a means of dissolving]{.mark} the principium
individuationis: the principle of [bourgeois subjectivity]{.mark}, on
which the homogeneous order of society - a world of loneliness and
fragmentation - depends. For, according to Bataille, "the general
movement of life is . . . accomplished beyond the demands of
individuals.\" [It is in precisely this spirit that he celebrates the
non-utilitarian nature of]{.mark} "combat" or
"[war]{.mark}]{.underline}" as a type of aestheticist end in itself:
"Glory . . . expresses a movement of senseless frenzy, of measureless
expenditure of energy, which the fervor of combat presupposes. Combat is
glorious in that it is always beyond calculation at some moment."33 For
the same reasons, Bataille eulogizes those premodern "wamer societies in
which pure, uncalculated violence and ostentatious forms of combat held
sway. For under such conditions, war was not made subservient to the
vulgar ends of enterprise and accumulation, as is the case for
modern-day imperialism, but served as a glorious end in itself. Yet, in
the early 1930s, it was precisely this aestheticist celebration of
"violence for violence's sake," or "war for war's sake," that Benjamin
viewed as the essence of modem fascism. As he remarks in a well known
passage: "Fiat ars - pereat mundus," says fascism, and, as Marinetti
admits, expects war to supply the artistic gratification of a sense
perception that has been changed by technology. . . . Mankind, which in
Homer's time was an object of contemplation for the Olympian gods, now
is one for itself. Its self-alienation has reached such a degree that it
can experience its own destruction as an aesthetic pleasure of the first
order. This is the situation of politics which fascism is rendering
aesthetic.' [In Bataille's thought war serves as the harbinger of a
cultural transfiguration]{.mark} in which the primacy of self-subsistent
subjectivity would be replaced by the values of an "unavowable" or
"ecstatic community": that is, a community that would no longer be
governed by the goals of a "visual culture" - transparency,
self-identity, etc. - but instead, those of self-laceration, difference,
and finitude. In fact, this Bataille-inspired program of an ecstatic
community has been quite explicitly carried forth and explored in the
political writings of Maurice Blanchot (La Communautk inavouable; 1983)
and Jean-Luc Nancy (La Communautk dboeuvrke; 1985).

[[Death cult and ritual point to what Bataille regarded as]{.mark}

societies]{.mark}."]{.underline}86 In his famous 1933 essay, "The
Psychological Structure of Fascism,"87 [[Bataille develops]{.mark} his
chief categories of [heterogeneous social existence]{.mark} versus
social homogeneity, and elucidates them [by applying them to fascism and
democracy respectively: The fascist leaders are incontestably part of
the heterogeneous existence]{.mark}. Opposed to [democratic
politicians]{.mark}, who [represent]{.mark} in different countries the
platitude inherent to [homogeneous society]{.mark}, Mussolini and Hitler
immediately stand out as something other]{.underline}. . . . [It is
impossible to ignore the force that situates them above men, parties,
and even laws: a force that disrupts the regular course of things, the
peaceful but fastidious homogeneity powerless to maintain
itself]{.underline} (the fact that laws are broken is only the most
obvious sign of the transcendent, heterogeneous nature of fascist
action). [Democracy is identified with homogeneity; while [fascism,
endowed with the aura of heterogeneity and otherness, is]{.mark}
commended for [disrupting democracy's homogeneous
world]{.mark}!]{.underline} But this is not all. [Bataille proceeds to a
veritable panegyric to "heterogeneous fascist action": it "belongs to
the entire set of higher forms. It makes an appeal to sentiments
traditionally defined as exalted and noble and tends to constitute
authority as an unconditional principle, situated above any utilitarian
judgment]{.underline}."88 [Of the various things that fascinate Bataille
in fascist action and politics, two stand out: sovereignty and
affectivity. Bataille's admiration for both Duce and
Führer]{.underline}, and for "the force that situates them above men,
parties, and even laws," [is of a piece with his Nietzschean preference
of sovereign mastery in his reading of Hegel's master-slave dialectic.
[Sovereignty is the "imperative form of heterogeneous existence"; its
simplest form is "dominating one's fellows]{.mark}]{.underline}," which
"implies the heterogeneity of the master, in so far as he is the master:
to the extent that he refers to his nature, to his personal quality, as
the justification of his authority, he designates his nature as
something other, without being able to account for it rationally";89
just like Nietzsche's notion of sovereign mastery, it derives much of
its power from dispensing with a rational account of itself. In either
case, [sovereignty is a self-asserting life-force. With the exalted
designation of "fascism as the sovereign form of sovereignty," Bataille
elevates fascism to the epitome of sovereignty, the sovereignty of
sovereignties]{.underline}, as it were, [an intensified and most
effervescent form. With fascism's reestablishment of sovereignty in
political and social action goes the reawakening of affectivity in
politics:]{.underline} The force of a leader is analogous to that
exerted in hypnosis. The affective flow that unites him with his
followers---which takes the form of a moral identification of the latter
with the one they follow (and reciprocally)---is a function of the
common consciousness of increasingly violent and excessive energies that
accumulate in the person of the leader and through him become widely
available.91 [Fascism's "timely recourse to reawakened affective forces"
(159) gives rise to "affective politics"---so lacking in the sterile
homogeneity of democratic societies and their politics.]{.underline}
What to make of this panegyric to fascism by a professed Marxist and
organizer of Contre-Attaque, a coalition of antifascist intellectuals?
To characterize Batailles' stance on fascism as "equivocal," as Denis
Hollier does, is not wrong,92 but it is to say too little. There is a
strong fascination with German and Italian fascism at work that surfaced
even in Bataille's manifestoes and speeches for Contre-Attaque. The
attack in them was chiefly on parliamentary democracy and the ruling
left-wing Popular Front. Its tone tried to out-fascist the fascists: The
time has come for all of us to behave like masters and to physically
destroy the slaves of capitalism. . . . [We intend to make use of the
weapons created by fascism, which has known how to make use of the
fundamental human aspirations for affective exaltation and fanaticism .
. . we prefer . . . come what may, the anti-diplomatic brutality of
Hitler, which is more peaceful than the slobbering excitation of our
diplomats and politicians]{.underline}" [Wolin calls this Left-fascism:
adopting fascist means for left-wing ends]{.underline}.94 Yet it hardly
differs from the real thing. Breton and his fellow-surrealists, who had
initially joined Contre-Attaque despite the bad blood that existed
between them and Bataille,95 soon parted company with it, accusing
Bataille of surfascisme. Doubtlessly, at that point, Bataille's
discourse displayed a strong affinity to fascism. After World War II, he
conceded as much: he and his circle had succumbed to what he called a
"paradoxical fascist tendency."96 Yet there is nothing paradoxical about
it. The essay that begins as a critical dissection of fascism in the
spirit of Marxism ends up as a panegyric to fascism---how could that
have come about? Quite simply: the essay's argument changes register at
just the point at which Bataille introduces his
"homogeneity/heterogeneity" dichotomy. Profoundly informed, as it is,
with Nietzschean categories of force, primal drive, effervescence,
Dionysian exuberance and excess, violence, and mastery/sovereignty, it
fundamentally assumes a Nietzschean tenor, morphing the intended
critique of fascism into its panegyric. [Bataille's discourse is in
thrall to Nietzsche's cratological vitalism, which forces its dynamic on
his understanding of fascism the same way it does on his reading of
Hegel's master-slave dialectic. This change of register from Marxism to
Nietzscheanism anticipates a general trend on the French Left since the
60s that saw the displacement of the Hegelian-Marxist dialectic by
Nietzschean vitalism and irrationalism]{.underline}. The latter took
hold of French thought in 1930s and 1940s and resurfaced in the 1960s
through the influence Bataille exerted on the formation of the
post-structuralist discourse[. This accounts for the post-structuralist
preoccupation with the themes of death, violence, cruelty, sacrifice,
Dionysian excess, and sovereign mastery---also the predominant themes of
the Young-Conservative Revolutionaries and their fascist
allies]{.underline}. The common denominator is Nietzscheanism. [Gone are
today the embarrassing panegyrics to fascism. Yet there is an echo of
this in Bataille's weirdest heirs among the post-structuralists: the
party of abjection. With his sacralizing of bodily wastes, including the
rotting corpse]{.underline}---the body turned to waste---[Bataille had
inspired the quaintest of postmodern cults: the cult of the abject. In
addition to Death, Desire, and Dementia, the Abject forms a further
dimension of the post-structuralist Other, designed to liberate us from
the cage of our encapsulated sanitized subjectivity]{.underline}.
Derrida joined in by endowing vomit with heterological dignity and the
conceptual status of the Other as a force deconstructing the beautiful
and the moral: in the spirit of Bataille, he called it an "elixir, even
in the very quintessence of bad taste."97 Yet Bataille's chief heir in
the matter of abjection is not Derrida, but Julia Kristeva; it is she
who echoes said "paradoxical tendency" when, in theorizing the
Bataillian legacy, she includes the anti-Semitic and fascist writings of
Louis-Ferdinand Céline in the canon of liberating abjection for their
"avowed delirium"98 (a highly valorized ingredient in postmodern
Dionysianism). The formative impact of Bataille on post-structuralism
can hardly be overstated.

"Securitization Forum: The Transatlantic Divide: Why Securitization Has
Not Secured a Place in American IR, Why It Should, and How It Can," Duck
of Minerva, 9-18-2015,
http://duckofminerva.com/2015/09/securitization-forum-the-transatlantic-divide-why-securitization-has-not-secured-a-place-in-american-ir-why-it-should-and-how-it-can.html

Securitization theory has rightly garnered much attention among European
scholars of international relations. Its basic claims are powerful: that
security threats are not given, but require active construction; that
the boundaries of "security" are malleable; that the declaration that a
certain problem lies within the realm of security is itself a productive
political act; and that "security" issues hold a trump card, demanding
disproportionate resources and silencing alternative perspectives.
Securitization thus highlights a familiar, even ubiquitous, political
process that had received little attention in the international
relations or comparative foreign policy literatures. It gave scholars a
theoretical language, if not quite a set of coherent theoretical tools,
with which to make sense of how a diverse set of issues, from migration
to narcotics flows to global climate change, sometimes came to be
treated as matters of national and global security and thereby---and
this is where securitization's critical edge came to the fore---impeded
reasoned political debate. No surprise that, as Jarrod and Eric observe,
securitization has been the focus of so many articles in the EJIR---and
even more in such journals as the Review of International Studies and
Security Dialogue. But [there are (good) substantive and]{.underline}
(not so good) [sociological reasons that **securitization has failed to
gain traction in North America**]{.underline}. First, and [most
important, securitization describes a process but leaves us well short
of (a) a fully specified causal theory that (b) takes proper account of
the politics of rhetorical contestation]{.underline}. According to the
foundational theorists of the Copenhagen School, actors, usually elites,
transform the social order from one of normal, everyday politics into a
Schmittian world of crisis by identifying a dire threat to the political
community. [They conceive of this "securitizing move" in linguistic
terms, as a speech act]{.underline}. As Ole Waever (1995: 55) argues,
"By saying it \[security\], something is done (as in betting, a promise,
naming a ship). . . . \[T\]he word 'security' is the act . . ."
\[emphasis added\]. Securitization is a powerful discursive process that
constitutes social reality. Countless articles and books have traced
this process, and its consequences, in particular policy domains.
[Securitization presents itself as a **causal** account. But its
**mechanisms remain obscure**, as do the **conditions** under which it
operates]{.underline}. Why is speaking security so powerful? [How do
mere words twist and transform the social order? Does the invocation of
security prompt a visceral emotional response? Are speech acts
persuasive, by using well-known tropes to convince audiences that they
must seek protection? Or does securitization operate through the
politics of rhetorical coercion, silencing potential opponents? In
securitization accounts, **speech acts** often seem to be **magical
incantations** that upend normal politics through pathways shrouded in
mystery]{.underline}. [Equally unclear is why **some** securitizing
moves resonate, while others \[are **ignored**\]]{.underline} ~~fall on
deaf ears~~. [Certainly not all attempts to construct threats
succeed]{.underline}, and this is true of both traditional military
concerns as well as "new" security issues. [Both neoconservatives and
structural realists in the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[have long insisted that **conflict with China is inevitable**, yet
China has over the last **25 years** been more opportunity than threat
in US political discourse---**despite** these **vigorous and persistent
securitizing moves**]{.underline}. [In very recent years, the balance
has shifted, and the China threat has started to catch on: **linguistic
processes alone cannot account for this change**]{.underline}. The US
military has repeatedly declared that global climate change has profound
implications for national security---but that has hardly cast aside
climate change deniers, many of whom are ironically foreign policy hawks
supposedly deferential to the uniformed military. Authoritative speakers
have varied in the efficacy of their securitizing moves. While George W.
Bush powerfully framed the events of 9/11 as a global war against
American values, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a more gifted orator,
struggled to convince a skeptical public that Germany presented an
imminent threat to the United States. [After thirty years as an active
research program, securitization theory has **hardly begun to offer
acceptable answers** to these questions. **Brief references to
"facilitating conditions" won't cut it**. You don't have to subscribe to
a covering-law conception of theory to find these questions important or
to find securitization's answers unsatisfying]{.underline}. A large part
of the problem, we believe, lies in securitization's silence on the
politics of security. Its foundations in speech act theory have yielded
an oddly apolitical theoretical framework. In its seminal formulation,
the Copenhagen school emphasized the internal linguistic rules that must
be followed for a speech act to be recognized as competent. Yet as
Thierry Balzacq argues, [by treating securitization as a purely
rule-driven process]{.underline}, the Copenhagen school [ignores the
politics of securitization]{.underline}, reducing "security to a
conventional procedure such as marriage or betting in which the
'felicity circumstances' (conditions of success) must fully prevail for
the act to go through" (2005:172). [Absent from this picture are fierce
rhetorical battles, where coalitions counter securitizing moves with
their own appeals that strike more or less deeply at underlying
narratives. Absent as well are the public intellectuals and media, who
question and critique securitizing moves]{.underline} sometimes (and not
others), [sometimes to good effect (and sometimes with little
impact)]{.underline}. [The **audience** itself---whether the mass public
or a narrower elite stratum---is **stripped of all
agency**]{.underline}. [Speaking security, even when the performance is
competent, **does not sweep this politics away**]{.underline}. Only by
delving into this politics can we shed light on the mysteries of
securitization. We see rhetorical politics as constituted less by
singular "securitizing moves" than by "contentious conversation"---to
use Charles Tilly's phrase. To this end, we would urge securitization
theorists, as we recently have elsewhere, to move towards a "pragmatic"
model that rests on four analytical wagers: that actors are both
strategic and social; that legitimation works by imparting meaning to
political action; that legitimation is laced through with contestation;
and that the power of language emerges through contentious dialogue. We
are heartened that our ambivalence about securitization---the ways in
which we find it by turns appealing and dissatisfying---and our vision
for how to move forward have in the last decade been echoed by (mostly)
European colleagues. These critics have laid out a research agenda that
would, if taken up, produce more satisfying, and more deeply political,
theoretical accounts. In our own work, both individual and collective,
we have tried to advance that research agenda. So long as securitization
theorists resist defining the theory's scope and mechanisms, and so long
as it remains wedded to apolitical underpinnings, we think it unlikely
to gain a broad following on this side of the pond. [Second,
securitization has been held back by another way in which it is
apolitical]{.underline}---this time thanks to its Schmittian commitments
and political vision. [Successful securitization, in seminal accounts,
replaces normal patterns of politics with the world of the
exception]{.underline}, in which contest has no place. [They imagine
security as the ultimate trump card. But, in reality, the divide is not
nearly so stark. Security **does not crowd out all other spending
priorities**---or states would spend on nothing but defense and
"securitized" issues. **Nor** does simply declaring something a matter
of national security **guarantee its funding**]{.underline}---or global
climate change counter-measures, including research on renewable
energies, would be well-funded. [Nor are security issues somehow aloof
from politics: politics has never truly stopped "at the water's edge."
Securitization considers only the politics of security. Its strangely
dichotomous optic cannot see or make sense of the politics within
security]{.underline}. In ignoring the politics within security,
securitization is of course in good company. Realists of all stripes
have paid little attention to domestic political contest, except as a
distraction from structural imperatives. But while realism is
unquestionably a powerful first-cut, [this inattention to the politics
within security is also among the reasons so many have found it
wanting]{.underline}. As Arnold Wolfers long ago observed, some degree
of insecurity is the normal state of affairs. But "some may find the
danger to which they are exposed entirely normal and in line with their
modest security expectations while others consider it unbearable to live
with these same dangers." And states, he further argues, do not actually
maximize security---almost ever. "Even when there has been no question
that armaments would mean more security, the cost in taxes, the
reduction in social benefits, or the sheer discomfort involved have
militated effectively against further effort" (1962:151, 153). [A
securitization perspective renders all this politics within security
inexplicable. And yet]{.underline}, as Wolfers saw half a century ago,
[it is crucial]{.underline}.

#### War structures inequalities, not the other way around

**Horgan 12**---John Horgan, Director of the Center for Science Writings
at the Stevens Institute of Technology, 2012, The End of War, Chapter 5,
Kindle p. 1600-1659

Throughout this book, I've examined attempts by scholars to identify
factors especially conducive for peace. But [there seem to be no
conditions that, in and of themselves, inoculate a society against
militarism]{.underline}. Not small government nor big government. Not
democracy, socialism, capitalism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, nor
secularism. Not giving equal rights to women or minorities nor reducing
poverty. The contagion of war can infect any kind of society. Some
scholars, like the political scientist Joshua Goldstein, find this
conclusion dispiriting. Early in his career Goldstein investigated
economic theories of war, including those of Marx and Malthus. He
concluded that [war causes economic inequality and scarcity of resources
as much as it stems from them]{.underline}. Goldstein, a self-described
"pro-feminist," then set out to test whether macho, patriarchal
attitudes caused armed violence. He felt so strongly about this thesis
that he and his wife limited their son's exposure to violent media and
contact sports. But by the time he finished writing his 522-page book
War and Gender in 2001, Goldstein had rejected the thesis. He questioned
many of his initial assumptions about the causes of war. He never gave
credence to explanations involving innate male aggression---war breaks
out too sporadically for that---but he saw no clear-cut evidence for
non-biological factors either. "[War is not a product of capitalism,
imperialism, gender, innate aggression, or any other single cause,
although all of these influence wars' outbreaks and
outcomes]{.underline}," Goldstein writes. "[Rather, war has]{.underline}
in part [fueled and sustained these and other injustices]{.underline}."
He admits that all his research has left him "somewhat more pessimistic
about how quickly or easily war may end." But here is the upside of this
insight: if there are no conditions that in and of themselves prevent
war, there are none that make peace impossible, either. This is the
source of John Mueller's optimism, and mine. [If we want peace badly
enough, we can have it,]{.underline} no matter what kind of society we
live in. The choice is ours. And [once we have escaped from the shadow
of war, we will have more resources to devote to other problems that
plague us, like economic injustice, poor health, and environmental
destruction, which war often exacerbates.]{.underline} The Waorani,
whose abandonment of war led to increased trade and intermarriage, are a
case in point. So is Costa Rica. In 2010, this Central American country
was ranked number one out of 148 nations in a "World Database of
Happiness" compiled by Dutch sociologists, who gathered information on
the self-reported happiness of people around the world. Costa Rica also
received the highest score in another "happiness" survey, carried out by
an American think tank, that factored in the nation's impact on the
environment. The United States was ranked twentieth and 114th,
respectively, on the surveys. Instead of spending on arms, over the past
half century Costa Rica's government invested in education, as well as
healthcare, environmental conservation, and tourism, all of which helped
make the country more prosperous, healthy, and happy. [There is no
single way to peace, but peace is the way to solve many other
problems.]{.underline} The [research]{.underline} of Mueller, Goldstein,
Forsberg, and other scholars [yields one essential lesson.]{.underline}
[Those of us who want to make the world a better place---more
democratic, equitable, healthier, cleaner---should make **abolishing the
invention of war** our priority, because peace can help bring about many
of the other changes we seek**.**]{.underline} [This formula turns on
its head the old social activists' slogan: "If you want peace, work for
justice]{.underline}." I say instead, "**[If you want justice, work for
peace.]{.underline}**" [If you want less pollution, more money for
healthcare and education, an improved legal and political system---work
for peace]{.underline}.

#### Transition wars

**Quilley 13** -- (2013, Stephen, Associate Professor, Department of
Environment and Resource Studies University of Waterloo, "De-Growth Is
Not a Liberal Agenda: Relocalisation and the Limits to Low Energy
Cosmopolitanism," Environmental Values 22 (2013): 261--285

In the literature [there is a common assumption that the politics of
degrowth will allow the values]{.underline} and agendas [of ecological
integrity, social inclusion, environmental justice, peace and
development]{.underline} in the global south, [to be
reconciled]{.underline} (Martinez-Alier et al. 2010). Emerging [in the
aftermath of the **economic crisis** of 2008]{.underline}, [it was
argued that recession and economic contraction should be seen as an
**opportunity for radical transformation**]{.underline}. Echoing Ophuls,
Kallis for instance argues that sustainable degrowth is not only an
'inevitable hy- pothesis but also a potent political vision that can be
socially transformative' (2011: 873). But unlike Ophuls, [there is very
little recognition of the complex constraints and trade-offs between
societal metabolism and the broader social and cultural
fabric.]{.underline} There is no sense, for instance, that **[democracy
or social liberalism come with a thermodynamic price tag]{.underline}**.

So how is it possible to start unravelling the interactions between
economics, politics, psychology and culture under conditions of
de-growth? It seems clear from the above discussion that [any trajectory
of metabolic contraction would have implications for **every aspect of
society**, right down to the structure of personality and levels of
inter-personal violence]{.underline}. The first thing to observe is that
[there are likely to be many different]{.underline} 'improbable
valleys', i.e. [equilibrium configurations differing with regard
to]{.underline} the total [population]{.underline}, [demographic
structure, technological level and material/energy
throughput]{.underline} etc. The overall scale of human activity is
[associated in complex and non-linear ways]{.underline} with a wide
range of parameters and phenomena, including:

population size,

the level of scientific and technological capability,

the level of technical innovation,

energy throughput,

material throughput,

the extent of technical-social division of labour,

the extent of individuation,

the prevalence of restrained, individuated personality structures,

the effectiveness of state institutions,

the scale and intensity of interdependencies mediated by economic
exchanges,

cultural diversity,

democratic voice and traction of minority and marginalised groups,

the strength and traction of liberal-cosmopolitan values and behaviour,

the level of interpersonal violence,

the level and intensity of inter-state violence.

[The characteristics of any]{.underline} particular [society emerging
from a]{.underline} process of radi[cal transition will depend
upon]{.underline} in [which of the many]{.underline} conceivable
['improbable valleys' it comes to rest]{.underline}, [but also the
**speed and trauma** associated with the transformation]{.underline}.

First of all, our valley could be home to a stable population of varying
size. [Whilst there is]{.underline} some [consensus that 9 billion plus
is not sustainable]{.underline} in the long run, [it is not clear how
quickly global population could come down without **catastrophic
violence or societal implosion**]{.underline}. Clearly the maximum size
of a population at equilibrium would also be a function of technology
and throughput.

From the discussion above, it seems fair to say that [individuation is a
function of social complexity and the division of labour, and therefore
of **energy and material throughput**]{.underline}. From Elias there is
also a strong case to be made that [any significant decline in the
overall scale of economy, the intensity and complexity of social life,
would be accompanied by a process of **'decivilisation'**]{.underline}
(Mennell 1990), a tilting of the I/We balance in favour of the latter,
[a diminish- ing of the socialised restraints on impulsive behaviour,
greater volatility and quite possibly a marked **increase in the level
of interpersonal violence**]{.underline}. None of this is incompatible
with the utopian-Romantic assertion that smaller scale, gemeinschaftlich
communities, though associated with greater levels of frater- nal
obligation (Ophuls 2011: 191), would provide more opportunities for more
people to express more fully their creative and social human nature.

[Cosmopolitan diversity is a function of]{.underline} the circulation of
goods, people and information, and so **[the overall scale of the
economy]{.underline}**. [The dynamic, multicultural mosaic]{.underline}
and the melting pot of continual migration [are bound up with ubiquitous
cheap energy which allows for a continual replenishing of the reservoirs
of ethnic and cultural difference]{.underline} [as well as state
interventions]{.underline} to smooth over the fracture lines between
communities. [Any radical reduction]{.underline} in that circulation
[would]{.underline} tend to [reduce diversity]{.underline} and move
political and social life towards more communitarian forms. [Combined
with the contraction in the scope and capacities of the state, such a
development would have clear implications for the politics of
diversity.]{.underline} In this context, **[rapid, crisis-driven change
would be more likely to engender communal violence]{.underline}**.

More generally, [the enfranchisement of a succession of groups
marginalised by **gender, race, religion, sexuality and
disability**,]{.underline} the sine qua non of democratic liberal
states, [should be seen as an investment in social-institutional
complexity made possible by the availability of cheap
energy]{.underline} (see Tainter 1990). [Any assumption that such social
and institutional forms would survive the transition]{.underline} to a
low-energy regime [should be seen as **highly
questionable**.]{.underline}

With regard to the economy, [there is clearly a strong, positive
relationship between science, technology and innovation]{.underline} on
the one hand, [and economic/ demographic scale on the
other.]{.underline} Without specifying the level of technology it is
impossible to say anything meaningful about the scale of economy
relative to the biosphere. [None of the proponents of de-growth are
willing to countenance a world without the internet or
antibiotics]{.underline} and even Ophuls concedes that old-time
Jeffersonians might still need 'modern dentistry'. But [any given
technology will be associated with]{.underline} a minimum division of
labour and [overall]{.underline} material/energetic
[throughput]{.underline}. George Stevenson developed and manufactured
steam locomotives in the context of a national5 coal industry and a
popula- tion of 30 million. INTEL microchips have been developed on the
back of global technical and innovation systems and serve a global
market of hundreds of millions of people. [We still have no clear idea
about how much room for manoeuvre there is]{.underline}, if any, between
the maximum scale of global economy compatible with biosphere integrity,
and the minimum scale conducive to a given technology-set or desired
level of cultural diversity.

[**Even from a strictly evolutionary-ecological perspective**, the
trade-offs are highly complex]{.underline}. For instance,
[scientific-technological stasis]{.underline} might be a pre- condition
for ecological sustainability but it also [may circumscribe the human
capacity to **respond to future threats** to the biosphere]{.underline}.
In The Revenge of Gaia James Lovelock alludes to the importance of
sustaining [technological complexity and a science base]{.underline},
arguing that such a 'Gaian civilisation' [might]{.underline} in the end
[play a positive role in safeguarding the biosphere from **devastating
external threats** such as a potentially terminal asteroid
impact.]{.underline}

Finally, for all that we can identify these parameters, [it is certain
that they do not vary and interact in a linear fashion]{.underline}. We
have good historical evidence of a relationship between the I/We balance
and the process of individuation, and the increasing energy throughput
associated with economic activity. But **[we have no historical examples
of this process moving in the reverse direction]{.underline}**. [We
don't know to what extent the 'superstructure']{.underline} of liberal,
cosmopolitan ideas and values [might carry over and endure]{.underline}
in the context of much smaller societies with attenuated divisions of
labour

So what does all this say about getting down to that Improbable Valley?
The prime directive of ecological economics (e.g. Daly and Farley 2004)
is that market efficiency should be subordinate to distribution
(justice) which should be subordinate to scale (ecology). [The defining
rationale of the steady- state economy is]{.underline} that the
[throughput of energy and materials]{.underline} and the spatial extent
of human activities [should be]{.underline} stabilised and gradually
[reduced]{.underline}. In short, the economy of our Improbable Valley
must be significantly smaller than that of Mount Impossible.

[But the smaller our Valley, the more likely its political and social
culture will be illiberal and marked by higher levels of]{.underline}
interpersonal [violence]{.underline}, the more difficult it will become
to sustain the institutions of science and build on the existing stock
of scientific knowledge. [There will be a threshold below which the
institutions of science will ossify and even collapse]{.underline},
**[with the result- ing vacuum filled by competing religious sources of
meaning and truth]{.underline}**, the slower the rate of technological
progress. Beyond a certain threshold, a steady state economy will lose
cascades of technological and manufacturing capability. Knowing in
theory how to build a silicon chip is a long way short of real
manufacturing capability, which tends to reside as much in the
organisational memories, routines and tacit knowledge of corporations as
in books. If the Valley stops building certain classes of artefacts,
eventually (perhaps quickly) knowledge of how to produce them will also
disappear.

On this basis, [it would be a good idea for ecological economists, peak
oil commentators and collapse theorists to try and work out if there is
any room for manoeuvre between the maximum scale]{.underline} of
economic flows [compatible with]{.underline} the [long term]{.underline}
integrity and [resilience of the biosphere, and the minimum scale for a
moderately liberal, science-based civilisation retaining a capacity for
continuing technical innovation]{.underline} (albeit at a slower rate)
and a broad-based manufacturing capability.

involved in the movement from one type of capitalism towards another
[generally occur in the wake of systemic crises]{.underline}, i.e. deep
economic crises that cannot be resolved within the framework of existing
institutional arrangements (Kotz, 2009). [**Yet countless studies** have
concluded that even such institutional "paradigm shifts" **almost never
involve a clean break** with the past]{.underline}. [One reason for this
is **path dependence**]{.underline}, i.e. the phenomenon that [once a
particular institutional path has been established, 'patterns of
political mobilization, the institutional "rules of the game," and even
citizens\' basic way of thinking about the political world' tend to
generate **self-reinforcing dynamics**]{.underline} [that make reversals
of the path difficult]{.underline} (Pierson, 2004: 10). [Ideas and
culture contribute to **make profound institutional changes
difficult**]{.underline}. [Once particular ideas have become
hegemonic]{.underline} (or "common sense"), [they serve to **prevent
policy-making in terms of different ideas**.]{.underline} Societal power
relationships are important in this context. The ideas that prevail and
become institutionalised are those that can be sustained by material
resources and thus tend to be those supported by powerful members of the
political elites and the capitalist class (e.g., van Apeldoorn, 2002).
Changes in prevailing ideas are thus often preceded by major disruptions
of existing power relations --- disruptions that in turn often occur in
the context of the aforementioned systemic crises (Buch-Hansen, 2012 and
Wigger and Buch-Hansen, 2013). Yet [**even in the wake of such
disruptions**, institutional change is likely to either take the form of
bricolage involving 'the rearrangement or recombination of institutional
principles and practices in new and creative ways' or of translation,
denoting 'the blending of new elements into already existing
institutional arrangements']{.underline} ( Campbell, 2010: 98--99).
Through processes of bricolage and translation,
[institutions]{.underline} are changed considerably yet '**[still
resemble their predecessors to a significant degree]{.underline}** in so
far as they are made up of institutional principles and practices that
entrepreneurs have inherited from the past' ( Campbell, 2010: 99; see
also Carstensen, 2011).

#### Political resistance prevents a transition

**Waddock 17** (Sandra Waddock, Boston College, Carroll School of
Management, 2017, "The Necessary Transition: The Journey towards the
Sustainable Enterprise Economy")

[Whatever their corporate social responsibility/corporate
responsibility]{.underline} (CSR/ CR) [efforts may be, and however far
some leading companies have moved]{.underline} (and some indeed have),
[there is still **far too much greenwashing and too little reality to
sustainability initiatives**]{.underline}. [Too many CR initiatives are
still done **only to enhance reputation** rather than being truly
integrated into company practices]{.underline}. Not to mention that [too
many companies are well behind on the **learning curve** around CR and
sustainability in the first place]{.underline}. Further, even among
companies that develop terrific CSR/CR initiatives, [there is still an
inability or unwillingness on the parts of many to deal with the
problematic ecological and societal impacts of their **business
model**]{.underline}, which is of course where the biggest impacts are.
Despite efforts such as the WBCSD's Vision 2050 (WBCSD 2010), which
tries to map out what it calls a platform for dialogue on sustainability
and a vision of a sustainable future that is quite radical in its
approach, there is still an emphasis on continuing business-asusual.

#### Cap ideology inev

Resilience through Local Translation",
http://www.euvisions.eu/neoliberalisms-resilience-translation/

One powerful message permeating the book, and which gives a forceful
explanation to Colin Crouch's punchy title is that: "**[rather than a
mass-produced, slightly shrunk, and off-the-rack ideological suit,
neoliberalism is a bespoke outfit made from a dynamic fabric that
absorbs local color]{.underline}**" (5). **[Even under a full-out attack
against some of its basic assumptions]{.underline}**, **[such as the one
unleashed in the immediate wake of the global financial
crisis]{.underline}**, **[neoliberalism proved resilient beyond its many
architects' wildest dreams.]{.underline}** **[Its capacity to absorb,
coopt and recast selected ideas of oppositional social forces has been
the]{.underline}** most **[valuable asset guaranteeing its
survival]{.underline}**. Again, the comparison of the responses to the
crisis in Spain and Romania show such adaptability in full.¶ **[The
socialist government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero tried to salvage
the social-democratic legacies of the Spanish economy by engineering a
Keynesian rescue package. Only later, when the disaster of the cajas
became apparent and the emergency intensified, did conservative PM
Mariano Rajoy embrace more deregulation]{.underline}** in the labour
market (inspired by the Hartz IV reform) and extensive cuts in the
public sector under the strong external pressure of the European Central
Bank and of international financial markets.¶ **[In Romania, local
policymakers further radicalized in the aftermath of the Lehman
Brothers' crisis, thereby outbidding the IMF on austerity and structural
reforms. Instead of shielding lower-income groups, the opposite strategy
of upward redistribution was chosen]{.underline}**. By heroically
withstanding the external attempts at moderation, the Romanian economy
retained an unenviable mix of libertarian achievements (flat-tax rates),
experimental neoliberalism (privatized pensions) and mainstream
neoliberal orthodoxy (sound finance, labour market deregulation, social
policy targeting, privatization of all public companies). Pure
laissez-faire ideas such as the replacement of the welfare state by a
voluntary, private, Christian charity system were not unheard of.¶
Hence, through an insightful analysis of the ideational underpinnings of
its local interpretations, this book shows us that**[, despite the
challenges, neoliberalism is alive and kicking]{.underline}**. Ban
guides us through half a century of policymaking in Spain and Romania,
and embeds his analysis within the related nuances of contemporary
liberal economic thought. The research is a valuable addition to a
growing literature on the origin of current ideational frames and
comfortably sits alongside contemporary classics, such as Mark Blyth's
Austerity: The History of a Dangerous Idea.

### AT: Automation 

#### No automation risk\-\--alarmist studies don't account for [intra-occupational heterogeneity]{.underline} which [upward-inflates]{.underline} the risk

[Our analysis exploits]{.underline} **[detailed
information]{.underline}** [on the task content of jobs]{.underline}.
After linking expertbased assessments regarding the occupational risk of
automation to individual job tasks and characteristics, [we then
re-estimate the automation potential in two scenarios: In a first
scenario, we replicate the results of former studies with our data
assuming homogenous tasks within occupations]{.underline}. [In a second
scenario]{.underline}, [we allow for]{.underline} **[differences in the
tasks]{.underline}** [across workplaces within occupations]{.underline}.
Overall, [we find that the]{.underline} **[automation
risk]{.underline}** [of US jobs]{.underline} **[drops from 38 % to 9
%]{.underline}** [when allowing for workplace
heterogeneity]{.underline}. [Occupation-level assessments of automation
potentials thus are]{.underline} **[severely
upward-biased]{.underline}**

1 The occupation-level vs. job-level approach

[Our approach relates]{.underline} **[experts'
assessments]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} **[occupation-specific
automation risks]{.underline}** [as collected by Frey and
Osborne]{.underline} (2017) to individual job characteristics. The
underlying idea is to assume that the experts' assessment regarding the
potential for automating a particular occupation contains valid
information, but captures only a representative occupation that masks
important differences at the level of workplaces within its profession.
Hence, [we merge]{.underline} [the information on occupation-specific
automation risks to workers in that particular occupation for whom the
PIACC database also includes individual-level information
on]{.underline} **[socio-economic and job-related
characteristics]{.underline}**. We then estimate the following
fractional response model: 𝑎𝑎𝑜𝑜 = ∑ 𝛽𝛽𝑘𝑘𝑥𝑥𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 + 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖 𝐾𝐾 𝑘𝑘=1 , where
𝑎𝑎𝑜𝑜 represents the automation risk of individual i's occupation 𝑜𝑜 as
provided by Frey and Osborne (2017) and where xki represents the K job
characteristics of worker 𝑖𝑖 including 25 tasks as well as variables to
capture that the actual content of a specific task may vary across
individuals and firms depending on firm-size, gender, education or
competences.1 The coefficients βk measures the influence of the K job
characteristics on the occupation-specific automation potential, which
we then use to predict automation potentials for each individual job i,
𝑎𝑎�𝑖𝑖 = ∑ 𝛽𝛽 �𝑘𝑘𝑥𝑥𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 𝐾𝐾 𝑘𝑘=1 . [Note that by projecting
occupation-level risks of automation on job-level characteristics, our
approach allows for]{.underline} **[within-occupational
heterogeneity]{.underline}** [in the predicted automation potential as
jobs may differ in K job characteristics]{.underline}.

Since the original automation potential ao is measured at the
occupational level it does not contain the job-level-variation in the
exposure to automation which implies a measurement error in the
dependent variable. An additional measurement error in this variable
results from the discrepancy between the Standard Occupational
Classification (SOC) for which the occupation-specific risk assessments
are available and the PIACC data that contains the ISCO classification.
We rely on the Bureau of Labor Statistics' correspondence table to
transfer the SOC-level automation potentials to the ISCO classification.
As a consequence, j multiple values of the automation potential aoj are
assigned to each individual i in the PIAAC data, whenever there is no
one-to-one assignment between both classifications. We use the
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm proposed by Ibrahim (1990) for
the estimation of the fractional response model described above in order
to cope with these measurement errors. Essentially, the method estimates
the weights for each individual's multiple values aoj that maximize the
likelihood of being the "correct" automation risk, given workers'
characteristics. This yields a weighted occupational risk of automation
that varies across individuals given their characteristics. Hence, the
imputation method addresses both the assignment problem due to the
mismatched occupational classifications and, at the same time, yields
individual level automation risks. See Ibrahim et al. (2005) for
applications.

Based on the coefficient estimates, we predict the automation risks at
the job level 𝑎𝑎�𝑖𝑖 (joblevel approach). For comparison, we additionally
estimate occupation-level automation potentials by keeping tasks
constant within occupations to replicate former studies. For this, we
calculate the occupation-level median of our variables 𝑥𝑥�𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘, predict
the occupation-specific automation potential 𝑎𝑎�𝑜𝑜 = ∑ 𝛽𝛽 �𝑘𝑘𝑥𝑥�𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 𝐾𝐾
𝑘𝑘=1 and apply these risks to all workers in occupation o.

2 Re-assessing the risk of automation

Descriptive statistics for the explanatory variables as well as average
marginal effects resulting from the fractional response model described
in Section 2 are shown in the Appendix. [Overall]{.underline}, [we find
that the automation potential is lower in jobs that require programming,
presenting, training or influencing others]{.underline}. In contrast,
the risk of automation is higher in jobs with a high share of tasks that
are related to exchanging information, selling or using fingers and
hands. This resembles the evidence from the task-based literature which
argues that routine tasks are subject to automation, whereas interactive
or cognitive tasks are less likely to be substituted by machines and
computers (see Acemoglu and Autor 2011).

Figure 1 compares employment shares by decile of the predicted
automation risk distribution in the US between the occupation-level vs.
job-level approach. The results for the occupationbased approach
resemble the bi-polar structure from previous risk assessments, i.e. the
majority of jobs are assigned either a very high or a very low risk of
automation. Accordingly, 38 % of the workers perform jobs with a risk of
automation above 70 %. In contrast, [when using the **job-level
approach**]{.underline}, i.e. [predicting the risk of
automation]{.underline} **[at the level of individual
jobs]{.underline}** 𝑎𝑎�𝑖𝑖, [we find **only a moderate polarization** in
automation probabilities]{.underline} with most jobs being exposed to a
medium risk of automation. [Hence]{.underline}, **[only 9
%]{.underline}** [of all workers in the US face a risk of automation
that exceeds 70 %.]{.underline}

Evidently, [our job-level approach suggests a much lower share of jobs
at risk of automation compared to previous occupation-level assessments,
as the job- is below the occupation-level estimate **for 76% of all
workers**]{.underline} (Figure 2). This is counterintuitive: as both
predictions are computed using the same model, parameter estimates and
data, one would expect the two estimates to be similar. The only
difference between both approaches is that we use occupation-level
median task values in the occupation-level approach, whereas we use the
individual-level task information in the job-level approach. The
difference between the joband occupation-level results therefore is
solely driven by the fact that the majority of jobs involve
non-automatable tasks more often compared to the occupational median
job, as workers of the same occupation specialize in different
non-automatable tasks. As an example, consider Numerical and Material
Recording Clerks (ISCO08=43), for which our occupationlevel estimates
suggest a high (74.4%) risk of automation. According to the data, many
clerks of this profession specialise in niches that involve
non-automatable tasks such as presenting, planning or problem solving.
Taking the large and heterogeneous range of their tasks into account
suggests that only 18.2% of them actually face a high risk of
automation. Put differently, **[the average worker does a job that is
much less automatable]{.underline}** [than the median job in this
occupation]{.underline}. Technically speaking, the contribution of each
task to an individuals' automation potential, 𝜇𝜇̂ 𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 = 𝛽𝛽̂ 𝑘𝑘𝑥𝑥𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘, is
negatively skewed within occupations for 72% of all tasks and there is
no systematic correlation between the tasks' contributions to automation
potentials (𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐(𝜇𝜇̂ 𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘, 𝜇𝜇̂ 𝑘𝑘′𝑖𝑖)). As a consequence, [the
occupational median job underestimates the relevance of many specialized
jobs with less automatable tasks, thus **leading to an upward-bias of
automation risks**]{.underline}.

3 Conclusion

[Our study reveals a]{.underline} **[serious and systematic upward
bias]{.underline}** [in occupation-level estimates of automation
potentials compared to a job-level approach]{.underline}, [as workers
specialize in nonautomatable niches within their
professio]{.underline}n. One potential reason for our results could be
that [workers increasingly focus on a **diverse set of tasks**
that]{.underline} **[complement these technologies]{.underline}**, [as
would be consistent with the evidence by Spitz-Oener]{.underline}
(2006). [This implies that the exposure to automation should be measured
at the level of jobs rather than occupations]{.underline}. When doing
so, still one in ten jobs is highly exposed. While some of these workers
may only need to adjust their tasks, others might actually lose their
jobs. Yet, whether this leads to net job losses depends on the relative
sizes of job-creation and job-destruction effects (Acemoglu and Restrepo
2017, Gregory et al. 2016).

#### [Substitution effect]{.underline} solves.

<https://thebreakthrough.org/images/pdfs/Nature_Unbound.pdf>.

[**Substitution** and **intensification** save]{.underline} or "spare"
[nature through]{.underline} what we call **[passive
protection]{.underline}**. 132,133 [When better and cheaper substitutes
exist for wildlife, the wildlife loses its economic value --- there
simply is **no economic rationale** for exploiting it]{.underline}. 134
It is passively protected. Both substitution and intensification also
contribute to passive protection of land, or "land sparing." they do so
by enabling land-intensive goods --- primarily biomass in different
forms --- to be produced in a smaller area. [When synthetic fertilizer
replaced organic, the pressure to convert new lands into agriculture
lessened]{.underline}. [Higher yields on existing farmland ---
intensification --- tend to lower prices of agricultural commodities,
making new conversion]{.underline} less profitable, or [not profitable
at all]{.underline}. 133,135 [It can]{.underline} also [lead to
abandonment of marginal agriculture, with]{.underline} attendant
[opportunities for habitat restoration and rewilding]{.underline}. 136
When there is no economic reason to exploit wildlife or land for
material purposes, it can be left alone, satisfying the aesthetic and
spiritual desires that underpin conservation. Nature use-less is nature
spared.

[Passive protection largely explains why **half of all land** on earth
has not been converted to human uses]{.underline}. [This includes a
large proportion of the Amazon basin and the boreal forest]{.underline}.
[It]{.underline} also [includes much of the land covered by protected
areas --- some 15% of the terrestrial ice-free surface]{.underline}. 137
[The reason the land-use glass is half full is that no profit could be
made by converting the land to agriculture or forestry]{.underline}. 138
[Areas where high economic returns can be had are, for the most part,
converted and actively used]{.underline}.

Two contrasting examples illustrate the principle of passive protection.
Lowland rainforests in Southeast Asia over the past decades have been
widely deforested. No wonder: each hectare can be worth over \$20,000
when logged and converted to oil palm plantations. 139 At the other end
of the spectrum, Russell Mittermeier et al. reckon the land values in
many biodiversity-rich wilderness areas of the world are about \$10 per
ha. 140 The implicit price of a hectare of land bought as part of the
Debt for Nature Swap initiative of the 1980s and 1990s was around \$5
per ha. 141 Conservation International bought a conservation concession
in Guyana at \$1.25 per ha per year. 142 [Land values this low are
indicative of passive protection]{.underline}. 141 In other words, [with
or without formal protection, these areas would likely have remained
intact]{.underline}. [Conservation is the economically rational
"highest" use of the land]{.underline}. [Half the world's land surface
is passively protected simply because we don't need it for any material
purpose; it doesn't make commercial sense to convert it]{.underline}.

#### Renewables and urbanization will decouple fossil fuels \-\-- best data.

Peter **NEWMAN 17**. Professor of environmental science at Curtin
University. "Decoupling Economic Growth from Fossil Fuels." *Modern
Economy* 8: 791-805. Emory Libraries.

The [Paris]{.underline} agreement in December 2015 (COP21) [was an
historic accord signed]{.underline} [by 196 nations]{.underline}. It was
significantly easier for the nations of the world to sign than in
Copenhagen in 2009 (COP15) as [the world could now see that the changes
being required on them were already underway without causing a decline
in wealth generation]{.underline}, as outlined above in Figure 1 and in
national data.

Nevertheless [it was a significant achievement]{.underline} and a lot of
lobbying and government activity was required [to demonstrate that it
was now possible to commit more heavily to the journey of removing
fossil fuel-based economies 100% by 2100]{.underline}. The follow-up
commitments began in New York in April 2016 with a signing by 175
nations [to ensure that climate change is "well below" the 2 degrees'
limit]{.underline} accepted by the world's scientists. Each country must
now deliver the ratification from their parliaments and begin the
adoption of annual goals that are meant to be ratcheted up whenever the
country feels able to do so.

[The role of government in providing regulations and infrastructure to
enable higher energy efficiency and low carbon electricity, fuels,
appliances, buildings and vehicles has been a driver of
change]{.underline} over the past 30 years. This process is usually one
of being a small step ahead and [pushing the system to produce a better
low carbon outcome without too much cost]{.underline} or change. However
it is possible, that [**disruptive innovations** will begin to take over
markets much quicker than governments have allowed for]{.underline}. In
our view the [emergence of solar and battery storage is likely to
rapidly displace coal and the **reduction of car dependence** and
**electrification of transport** is likely to rapidly displace
oil]{.underline}. This process will depend on whether [business and the
community]{.underline} can see the changes emerging and accept that new
fossil fuel-free goals are achievable in their cities and towns and how
they [can use the opportunity to ride this new economic wave rather than
try to prevent the change]{.underline}.

3.2.2. Business

There is a lot of evidence that [the next area of growth for business is
the green economy]{.underline} and that [there are large groups of
businesses]{.underline} partially or [totally funding green innovation,
products and services as the basis of their future]{.underline} \[15\].

[The most significant driver in the 21st century leading to the removal
of coal (and gas) for electricity production has been investment in
renewables]{.underline}. As shown in Figure 8 below [there was a point
around 2004 when investment in renewables by the world's bankers and
financiers outstripped fossil fuel-based power investment]{.underline}.
In the most recent data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance [the
investment ratio is now **2:1 in favour of renewables**]{.underline}.

Business has often been seen to have very short term goals of a year or
so in terms of their strategic plans for market gains. But investors
from the financial community look to see how they will make profits
right through the lending period which is usually 20 years. When
governments are debating the world's scientists about how quickly they
can remove fossil fuels from the market place, then [it is easy to see
why they would not want to invest in potential **stranded assets** like
coal-fired power stations when other options that governments and
scientists want to see, are available]{.underline}.

In the US in the past 5 to 8 years the [phasing out of coal was made
easier by the availability of natural gas]{.underline}. [At the same
time dramatic growth in solar and wind power was underway and now it is
possible to see how the natural gas limits are being reached as
renewables becomes the fuel of choice]{.underline} \[17\]. [The
combination of these two forces led to the collapse of coal
consumption]{.underline} in the US [and decline and fall of the largest
coal company]{.underline} Peabody with many stranded assets.

In Australia a similar process has been underway with gas as the
preferred option over coal but in the past 5 years the dramatic growth
in rooftop solar has created a significant market that was not
considered likely for decades. 1.5 million homes purchased roof top
solar in 5 years without any real subsidies like feed-in tariffs and in
Perth this reached 25% of households. The 550 MW produced is the largest
power station in Western Australia and has led to the Minister Energy
saying growth will inevitably reach 70% of households by 2020 and the
utilities will never again need to purchase a coal or gas-fired power
station \[18\].

The implications for the cities and towns in Western Australia for how
they manage a potentially carbon-free power future in the next decade
are a journey they were not prepared for. Fossil fuel-based power
stations are now likely to be stranded assets and the key questions are
about how battery storage can make this transition seamless for business
and households and how it can enable the electricity grid to be
maintained as a way of equitably distributing solar electricity. This is
likely to be different in different parts of the city as well as in
different types of settlements in rural and remote locations, as will be
discussed later.

3.2.3. Community

The reasons why Perth grew so rapidly in adoption of solar include
factors like easy access to Chinese mass produced PV cells (and now
batteries) and the high price of electricity, but mostly it was driven
by the community. In the 8 years from 2008 [there was a
significant]{.underline} economic boom in Western Australia when the
rest of the world was frantically adapting to the GFC. For a period
Perth became the wealthiest city in the world [and the new money was
flooding into many household bank accounts]{.underline}. [Many chose to
put it into a rooftop solar system because of their interest in long
term sustainability]{.underline} (over 80% of the community want to see
action on climate change) [as well as having an investment that would
pay for itself in 5 years]{.underline}.

Community values can easily be underestimated when facing the future and
the need to address complex matters like climate change. The majority of
this rooftop solar has gone into the outer suburbs which in Australia
are generally less wealthy though they often have bigger homes with
bigger roofs and bigger power bills \[19\]. The inner suburbs are much
higher socio-economically and have higher green intentions but in
reality it was the outer suburbs who have made the majority of the
investment in solar. It indicates that the mechanisms for decoupling
economic growth and fossil fuels will vary between cities and within
cities \[20\].

3.3. What about Oil?

[The reduction in consumption of oil is another example of how cities
have begun to drive the change to remove fossil fuels at a faster rate
than many anticipated]{.underline}. It also is a combination of
government, business and the community.

[The collapse in oil price as well as]{.underline} the collapse [in coal
price appears to be due to **demand issues**]{.underline} as well as
supply issues. [Demand for coal will continue to drop as renewables
takes over; especially as battery storage becomes cheap]{.underline}.
[Demand for oil is expected to decline as vehicle fleets are
electrified]{.underline}; however it has already gone down despite there
being only a few percent of electric vehicles. The reason why this has
happened appears to be a city issue: for the past 150 years cities have
been moving out as they have followed first trains and trams then
automobiles, but now they are coming back in \[21\].

[Our work on cities has shown that there is an **exponential
relationship** between urban density and car use/fuel use]{.underline}
as in Figure 9.

[If cities have begun to increase in density]{.underline} rather than
decrease then [they will drop down the steep curve quite quickly
creating exponential decline in car use]{.underline}. [This is what we
are now seeing in all the world's developed cities and the phenomenon is
being called **'peak car'** as car use per capita has peaked and is in
decline]{.underline}. Indeed it is very similar to the decoupling
phenomenon described above. [Many cities are now seeing that their
economic growth is dependent on them reducing their car
use]{.underline}. Hence cities like Washington DC and Portland, Oregon
have demonstrated that their wealth is decoupling from car use (Figure
10).

It should be no surprise that this strong decoupling is associated with
cities that have invested in good urban rail systems in recent decades.
The decoupling is closely associated with this as our data also shows
that [urban traffic is slowing in all the world's cities and urban rail
is now able to outcompete cars as they can go around, over or under the
traffic]{.underline} \[21\].

[Governments play a big part in generating this transition as they are
needed to help plan]{.underline}, though not necessarily finance, [such
large scale infrastructure]{.underline}. However [business and community
are]{.underline} also [critical as they are responding to a new economic
process associated with the knowledge economy]{.underline}. Many
businesses that are part of the new innovation economy are locating in
city centres where they can have creative face-to-face contact with
people from various backgrounds and professions \[22\] \[23\]. These new
jobs are generally for the young Millenials and also older wealthier
professionals. As a result they are the backbone of the social movement
that has rediscovered inner and central city living. [The market demand
for dense urbanism that is not car dependent has therefore grown
dramatically in the 21st century city]{.underline}.

In more recent work the same phenomenon of peak car has been found in
Shanghai and Beijing which are now carrying 8 and 9 million passengers a
day on their new Metro systems enabling a significant reduction in the
relative use of cars \[24\]. [The rapid change into decoupling growth in
wealth from growth in car use is happening in emerging cities because
they have the urban fabric that is not suited to large scale growth in
car use]{.underline}. [The building of 81 electric urban rail systems in
Chinese cities and 52 in Indian cities is indicative of how the switch
away from oil is happening before many expected]{.underline}.

3.4. The Future

A range of fossil fuel demand forecasts and the forecast just for
renewables are set out in Figure 11. The nine organizations they used
include the main fossil fuel companies and the main government-based
forecasting bodies of the IEA and the EIA. The average growth from 2015
to 2050 is 580 EJ to 850 EJ with the oil companies suggesting well above
these forecasts. The average for renewables goes from 80 EJ to 200 EJ
with the fossil fuel companies suggesting much less than this.

What this suggests is that based on historical trends global energy
demand is forecast simply to grow in line with global population growth
and growth in GDP. Owing to this, fossil fuel companies predict that due
to the continued forecasted rise of energy consumption, their products
will meet the majority of this demand with a small though growing
proportion of renewables. This is business as usual. However, [this
paper has shown that decoupling of fossil fuel energy from GDP has
become **firmly established** and is being driven by cities from across
the world]{.underline}. What if the trends are setting in to be
significantly faster than most of these forecasts dare to suggest?

What could happen if we took seriously the kind of disruptive
innovations in our cities that are likely to lead to rapid decline in
fossil fuels and rapid growth in renewables? [In order to separate out
the components of GHG growth we have used the **Kaye
simplification**]{.underline} (based on the old Paul Ehrlich
simplification of Impact being a combination population, resource
consumption per capita and technology efficiency per unit of resource
consumption):

> GHG carbon intensity per unit of energy GHG Energy
>
> x energy intensity per unit of wealth Energy GDP
>
> x wealth per capita GDP population x population

[The carbon intensity of energy is going down globally and will increase
rapidly as renewables increases its proportion]{.underline}. [The
decoupling of energy from wealth has been increasing with a 35%
decoupling between 1990 and 2015]{.underline} and from the above
diagrams [this will grow even more rapidly as the two separate
out]{.underline}. Wealth per capita is likely to continue its gradual
growth and population growth is predicted to continue but slow. [The
interactions between all these factors are complex for example urban
population growth will help propel the economic processes that enable
solar adoption and urban regeneration as well as being a factor in
creating more GHG until these processes enable the phase
out]{.underline}.

[The scenario considered most feasible will be something like the IPCC
goal of 80% less GHG by 2050]{.underline} as in Figure 12.

4\. Conclusion

[The end of fossil fuel dependence is hard to imagine but it is getting
easier because the trends show it is underway]{.underline}. This paper
has shown [the kind of **exponential growth** in renewables and decline
in fossil fuels that we have just started to see could in fact decouple
economic growth from fossil fuels **much more rapidly than most have
forecasted**]{.underline}. The continuation of these trends will require
a combination of different forms of solar-based power, different forms
of electric transport and different forms of urban fabric. Most of this
will be in cities. [Government, business and the community will drive it
in different ways in different parts of cities]{.underline}.

### AT: Financialization 

#### Financialization is heavily regulated now -- [capital limits]{.underline}, [derivatives regulation]{.underline}, and [stress-tests]{.underline} insulate the financial sector from the wholesale economy

Finance, and Professor of Public Policy @ the University of Michigan,

http://www.rsfjournal.org/doi/full/10.7758/RSF.2017.3.1.01)

OVERVIEW OF REFORMS

In the United States, [passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ("Dodd-Frank") ushered in
**comprehensive reform**]{.underline} [in key areas: enlarging the
regulatory perimeter by creating the authority to regulate financial
firms that pose a threat to financial stability]{.underline}, without
regard to their corporate form; [enacting a resolution authority to
**deal with the potential collapse** of these major firms in the event
of a crisis]{.underline}, without feeding a panic or putting taxpayers
on the hook; [attacking regulatory arbitrage]{.underline},
**[restricting risky activities]{.underline}**, [and beefing up banking
supervision]{.underline}; [requiring central clearing and exchange
trading of standardized derivatives]{.underline}, and capital, margin
and transparency throughout the market; [improving investor
protections]{.underline}; and establishing a new Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau to look out for the interests of American households.

[Today]{.underline}, [major financial firms are subject to]{.underline}
**[higher prudential standards]{.underline}**, [including higher capital
and liquidity requirements,]{.underline} **[stress tests]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} [resolution planning through "living wills." By
forcing firms to **internalize more of the costs** that they impose on
the system, they will be **incentivized to shrink and reduce their
complexity**]{.underline}, [leverage, and interconnections]{.underline}.
[Should such a firm fail, there will be a **bigger capital buffer to
absorb losses**]{.underline}. [To stem a panic, the Dodd-Frank Act
permits the]{.underline} Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
([FDIC]{.underline}) [to resolve the largest and most interconnected
financial companies **without exposing the system** to a sudden,
disorderly failure that puts the economy at risk.]{.underline}

[On the global level]{.underline}, [the international community has put
forward new rules on capital, so that there are **bigger buffers in the
system**]{.underline}

[in the event of failures]{.underline}. [Capital will be measured in a
**more conservative way**]{.underline}, [and capital levels are going up
significantly]{.underline}. [Systemically important firms will hold even
higher levels of capital]{.underline}. There are new rules on liquidity
and a global leverage limit. **[Derivatives reforms are
proceeding]{.underline}**, [as are new approaches to dealing with the
risks from repo and securities financing transactions]{.underline}.

Yet much more work remains to be done, and the financial sector did not
leave the battlefield after their defeats in 2010. Far from it. The
brutal fight over financial reform rages on, and there is serious risk
that a collective amnesia about the causes and consequences of the
financial crisis appears to be descending on global financial capitals
that will further weaken the resolve for reform (See, for example,
Coffee 2011, 2012).

COMPARING U.S. FINANCIAL REGULATION PRE-CRISIS AND POST-REFORM

**[Many readers may be skeptical]{.underline}** [regarding the efficacy
of the reforms that have taken place thus far, either because they think
they did not change the system enough, or because they think that they
went too far.]{.underline} The following section takes the time to chart
the path of reform so far, before turning to the difficulties and
dangers on the road ahead.

First, before Dodd-Frank, if an entity was a bank, it had tougher
regulations, more stringent capital requirements, and more robust
supervision; but if an entity was an investment bank engaged in the same
kind of maturity transformation, it had to abide by different rules (see
Scott 2010). When U.S. investment banks needed to find a "consolidated
holding company regulator" in order to meet European Union standards for
doing business in Europe, the Securities and Exchange Commission set up
a voluntary Consolidated Supervised Entity program which had little
oversight. The SEC was not established as a prudential regulator, did
not have clear supervisory power, and had little experience and few
trained examiners. Moreover, the leverage ratio that served as a
backstop for bank capital requirements was not applied to investment
banks.

The Federal Reserve was too lax in supervising firms where it did have
authority and it did not have any authority to set and enforce capital
requirements on the major institutions that operated businesses outside
of bank holding companies. That meant it had no supervision over
investment banks, diversified financial institutions such as AIG, or the
nonbank financial companies competing with banks in the mortgage,
consumer credit, and business lending markets. The Office of Thrift
Supervision viewed its role as supervising thrifts, not their holding
companies (such as AIG). Banks and thrifts freely engaged in risky
mortgage lending, and regulators did not step in until it was too late.

[Today, Dodd-Frank has provided authority for **clear**]{.underline},
**[strong]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[consolidated
supervision]{.underline}** [and regulation by the Federal Reserve of any
financial firm]{.underline}---regardless of legal form---[whose failure
could pose a threat to financial stability]{.underline}. The largest
investment banks that survived the financial crisis merged into or
became bank holding companies subject to Fed oversight. AIG, GE Capital,
Prudential, and MetLife have now been brought under Fed supervision
through the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) designation.
[As a result of Dodd-Frank changes, thrift holding
companies]{.underline} (including those with large insurance operations)
[are now supervised by the Fed]{.underline}. The Office of Thrift
Supervision and the SEC's investment bank regime have been abolished.
[Thus, all bank and thrift holding companies, as well as **systemically
important nonbank firms**]{.underline}, **[regardless of corporate
form]{.underline}**, [are supervised by the Federal
Reserve]{.underline}. [We will have a single point of accountability for
tougher and more consistent supervision of the largest and most
interconnected financial firms.]{.underline}

Although the regulatory infrastructure is, to put it mildly, far from
ideal, with too many divided responsibilities and too many opportunities
for turf battles or regulatory gaps, [Dodd-Frank created the FSOC, which
is responsible for identifying threats to financial stability and
dealing with them. The FSOC can recommend stricter regulatory action,
and regulators must either implement such changes or explain publicly
why they are not acting]{.underline} (see Gerson 2013). [Already, this
process has led the SEC to impose **stricter regulation of money market
funds**]{.underline} [than would otherwise have occurred]{.underline}
(Barr 2015a). The FSOC has the potential to get information across the
financial services marketplace through the Office of Financial Research
(OFR), which Dodd-Frank established and empowered to collect data from
any financial firm, and to develop and enforce standardization for data
collection. The OFR has begun to use this authority by developing a
"legal entity identifier" for financial transactions. The OFR is charged
with independently assessing risks in the financial system, and can
potentially serve as a counterweight to the Fed by providing independent
assessments of whether the Fed is adequately supervising the largest
firms and dealing with the critical issues in systemic risk. [A strong
OFR can serve as a **check and balance** for regulatory agencies,
ensuring that they improve their own performance or risk being
criticized]{.underline} (Ludwig 2012; Barr 2015a).

[Dodd-Frank provides for more stringent prudential standards and higher
capital and liquidity standards for the largest bank and nonbank
firms]{.underline}. In addition to the heightened capital requirements
applicable to all firms, [the largest firms are subject to a capital
surcharge, a leverage ratio, a toughened supplemental leverage ratio, a
more stringent liquidity requirement, and capital required to pass
stress tests.]{.underline}

[Already, capital levels in the banking system have doubled, and banks'
use of short-term nondeposit funding has plummeted]{.underline}. [The
**annual stress tests**]{.underline} [are evaluating a firm's ability to
withstand **deep market contractions**]{.underline}. [There are enhanced
rules on affiliate transactions and lending limits, and much stricter
proposed limits on counterparty credit exposures]{.underline}. Deposit
insurance premiums are going up on the very largest firms. The Volcker
Rule prohibits banking entities from engaging in certain proprietary
trading or running internal hedge funds, subject to a number of
exceptions, and also helps to simplify the task of winding down major
firms that are at risk of failure. [Moreover, the Fed is using
macro-prudential supervision as it increases its capacity to understand
and **mitigate risks to the financial system as a whole**.]{.underline}

There is a healthy debate about breaking up or limiting the size of
financial firms. [Under the Dodd-Frank Act, major firms are subject to a
**concentration limit** that generally prohibits a financial company
from engaging in mergers or acquisitions that would result in the firm's
liabilities]{.underline}---including wholesale funding and off-balance
sheet exposures---exceeding 10 percent of the liabilities of financial
companies as a whole. Dodd-Frank provides regulators with the authority
to require financial institutions to restructure their activities to
make it credible that they can be resolved if they are in danger of
collapse; the resolution planning process has already forced firms to
begin to simplify their organization form, develop "clean" holding
companies, and place large amounts of capital and long-term debt in the
holding company to assist with the resolution. The act also permits
regulators to force firms to be broken up if they fail to submit a
credible plan and thereafter fail to meet regulators' requirements to
restructure themselves to make resolution credible. Such [firms can also
be broken up if they are found to pose a grave threat to financial
stability]{.underline}. [These enhanced prudential measures for major
financial firms are likely to reduce risk in the financial system,
constrain further concentration, and **reduce "too big to fail"
distortions**.]{.underline}

Second, [before Dodd-Frank, shadow banking markets grew dramatically
with little oversight and in the absence of even regulatory or
marketwide knowledge about the nature of the markets they were serving.
For example, the OTC derivatives market---with a notional amount of
\$700 trillion at its peak---grew up in the shadows, with little
oversight. Credit derivatives, which were supposed to diffuse risk,
instead concentrated it.]{.underline} Synthetic securitization with
embedded derivatives magnified failures in the real securitization
market. Major financial firms used derivatives to increase their credit
exposure to each other, rather than decrease it.

**[We should never again face a situation]{.underline}**---[such as
AIG's \$2 trillion derivatives portfolio]{.underline}---[where the
potential failure of a virtually unregulated, capital-deficient major
player in the derivatives market can impose devastating risks on the
entire system]{.underline}. Insufficient capital meant that major
participants in the system could not reliably pay out on their
obligations, and insufficient margin meant that counterparties on every
transaction were more exposed to the risk of nonpayment. When the crisis
began, regulators, financial firms, and investors had an insufficient
understanding of the degree to which trouble at one firm spelled trouble
for another, because of the opacity of the market. This lack of
information magnified the contagion as the crisis intensified, causing a
damaging wave of margin increases, deleveraging, and credit market
breakdowns. Lack of transparency, insufficient supervision, and
inadequate capital and margin left our financial system vulnerable to
concentrations of risk, and to abuse.

[Today, under Dodd-Frank, regulators are putting in place the tools
**comprehensively to regulate the OTC derivatives market** for the first
time. The act requires all standardized derivatives to be centrally
cleared, which will substantially reduce the buildup of bilateral
counterparty credit risk between major financial firms]{.underline}.
Under Dodd-Frank rules, **[75 percent]{.underline}** [of new derivative
contracts were centrally cleared in 2015 as compared to only 15 percent
in 2007]{.underline} (Massad 2015). Central clearinghouses are subject
to strong prudential supervision under the Dodd-Frank Act. [Dodd-Frank
requires standardized derivatives to be traded on exchanges or
alternative swap execution facilities, which improves pre- and
post-trade price transparency]{.underline}. Trading transparency will
help to improve price competition as well as to improve safety and
soundness, as market participants and regulators will have full access
to current prices in the event of system disruptions. [Even
non-centrally-cleared OTC derivatives are to be reported to a trade
repository, making the market far more transparent]{.underline}.

[The act provides for prudential regulation, capital requirements, and
business conduct rules for all swap dealers and major swap participants.
It provides for robust capital and margin requirements for derivative
transactions, and higher requirements for those that are not centrally
cleared, providing a strong incentive to use central clearing and
maintain a bigger buffer against losses]{.underline}. It also provides
for regulatory and enforcement tools to go after manipulation, fraud,
and other abuse.

[At the same time as the act reforms derivatives markets, it provides a
new framework for **regulation of financial market utilities** and
critical payment, clearing, and settlement activities, including not
only those in the derivatives markets but also those in the wholesale
funding markets]{.underline}---securities financing transactions (such
as repo and securities lending), commercial paper, and prime
brokerage---that are critical to the shadow banking system.

In the lead-up to the financial crisis, major financial firms became
increasingly funded not by traditional bank deposits, nor even
longer-term funding in the commercial markets, but rather by overnight
funding in the repo markets. An important part of that market, the
triparty repo market, became increasingly concentrated in only two major
clearing banks, which were themselves exposed to counterparty risk from
securities firms borrowing intraday credit. As the triparty repo market
became more concentrated, it also became riskier because counterparties
came to accept not only Treasury securities as collateral, but also
highly rated but opaque asset-backed securities. These securities in
turn became riskier as credit rating agencies became increasingly
willing to label as safe assets that were lower quality, including pools
of securities backed only by poorly underwritten subprime and Alt-A
mortgages. When the financial crisis hit, repo and commercial paper
markets froze, and investors in money market funds ran, causing a
massive contraction in credit not only for financial firms but also
major firms in the real economy (that is, non-financial). This
contraction was overcome only with massive interventions by the Fed, the
FDIC, and the Treasury.

The Dodd-Frank Act provides the foundation fundamentally to reform the
wholesale funding markets by providing strong authority for the Federal
Reserve to regulate financial market utilities and critical payment,
clearing, and settlement activities; to set new rules for capital,
collateral, and margin requirements for repo and other securities
financing, and other critical markets; and to establish uniform
prudential standards throughout the financial system. While repo and
other securities financing policies are still a work in progress,
short-term financing reforms are already being reinforced by new capital
and liquidity requirements, liability concentration limits under the
act, and reforms to the assessment base for deposit insurance that
encompass all liabilities. Once fully implemented, these reforms will
have the combined effect of taxing short-term liabilities, which will
force firms to internalize more of the costs of short-term funding.
These steps have already reduced the use of short-term funding, and will
provide incentives to manage their use more carefully even when interest
rates normalize.

[The act also **fundamentally transforms** regulation of another major
element of the shadow banking system, securitization]{.underline}. [The
act]{.underline} **[requires deep transparency]{.underline}** [into the
structure of securitizations, including information about assets and
originators]{.underline}. [Securitization sponsors must generally retain
risk in their securitizations]{.underline}, unless the mortgages they
pool meet guidelines as plain vanilla "qualified residential mortgages"
so that incentives are better aligned among participants in the system.
[Capital rules will better account for risk in
securitizations]{.underline}. [Parallel changes in accounting rules will
now bring the most common forms of securitization onto the balance
sheet.]{.underline} Credit-rating agencies will be subject to heightened
liability for failure to conduct ratings with integrity, with
comprehensive oversight by the SEC, including policing of ratings
shopping and conflicts of interest; ratings themselves will be more
transparent and will include key information on rating methodology,
compliance, qualitative and quantitative data, due diligence, and other
protections.

[There are good news: near-term financial stability risks are **lower**,
driven by a decline in macroeconomic and emerging market
risks]{.underline}.

As outlined in the IMF's most recent World Economic Outlook, [the
upswing in global activity has **gained further steam**, with global
growth projected to rise to 3.6 percent in 2017 and 3.7]{.underline}
percent [in 2018]{.underline}---in both cases 0.1 percentage point above
our previous forecasts, and well above the global growth rate of 3.2
percent in 2016. This is [laying hopes for a **sustained recovery** and
should allow for the eventual **normalization** of monetary
policies]{.underline}.

[The **core** of the global financial system is
**stronger**]{.underline}. [Systemically important banks and insurers
continue to **enhance their resilience** by raising capital and
liquidity, addressing legacy issues, and adapting their business models
to the evolving regulatory and market environment]{.underline}.

In emerging markets, capital flows are rebounding, driven in part by
stronger fundamentals. Portfolio inflows to emerging market economies
are on track to reach \$285 billion in 2017, more than twice the total
over the past two years. The cost of financing is low, and their
currencies and equity prices have strongly appreciated this year.

[**Globally**, supportive **monetary and financial conditions** and
buoyant financial markets have helped foster growth and **repair balance
sheets**]{.underline}.

growth and leverage." *Journal of Financial Stability* In Press. Emory

[In response to the global financial crisis, macroprudential policy has
been]{.underline} given the objective of [**mitigating** systemic
financial stability risks, and]{.underline} [**several macroprudential
tools** have been designed to **curb excessive leverage** and/or
**build-up buffers** against likely future losses]{.underline}. The
macroprudential policy strategy has been defined by the European
Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) with reference to the guided discretion
principle, whereby [the exercise of judgement is complemented by
quantitative information derived from a set of selected indicators and
associated **early warning thresholds**]{.underline}. In particular,
with respect to the countercyclical capital buffer, [the Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision identified the aggregate private sector
credit-to-GDP gap as a useful buffer guide]{.underline}. However,
policymakers should supplement the signal coming from credit-to-GDP
trend deviations with judgement based on a broader information set, as
implicitly suggested also in the current Capital Requirements Directive
(CRD IV) by the European Commission. Our results support the view that
[taking into account other conditioning variables is
necessary]{.underline}, because not all credit expansions are bad for
financial stability. Indeed, the heroic task of [identifying credit
bubbles in real time]{.underline} ultimately [requires assessing whether
conjunctural credit developments might be disconnected from fundamentals
or reflect excessive risk taking and overly optimistic
expectations]{.underline}.

Looking at the overall macroprudential policy process, [tools
like]{.underline} our proposed [**Random Forest** can serve several
purposes]{.underline}. [First, the good out-of-sample performance of
such analytical models should help to **overcome** the possible inaction
bias on the part of policy makers]{.underline}. In case risks are
emerging which have in the past led to systemic banking crises, the onus
is on those who aim to use judgement alone to justify why
macro-prudential policy tools are not activated. [Second, the intuitive
nature of a **decision tree model**, which is preserved also by more
complex approaches like tree ensembles]{.underline}, is likely to
[increase acceptance of an analytical approach as a starting point for
policy discussions]{.underline}. Also, country specific issues affecting
the risk assessment can well be framed in our proposed approach by
appropriately extending the set of predictors. [Third, even if the
Random Forest model does not allow to pin down the contribution of each
predictor to the overall predicted crisis probability, it is **still
possible** to interpret crisis probability trends based on latest
developments in the **raw indicators**]{.underline}. This brings to a
narrative approach whereby [the nature of the vulnerability can be
identified, and the use of a specific policy instrument over another can
be suggested]{.underline}.

Finally, [one should also **not understate** the role of **quantitative
analyses** and policy guides in macroprudential policy-related
communication]{.underline}.21 Indeed, analogously to what happens in the
field of monetary policy, [anchoring policy decisions to transparent
**analytical tools** **enhances their effectiveness**]{.underline}. In
the macroprudential field, [banks could start adjusting their business
lines and balance sheets **even before** a policy enters into force,
because the analytical framework helps them understand that risks are
building up in the system, and in order to smooth the transition to an
anticipated new policy regime]{.underline}. More generally, [the
benchmark model]{.underline} we derive is a transparent tool which would
also [enable the public at large to understand and possibly anticipate
macroprudential decisions]{.underline}. Increased transparency on the
side of national and supra-national authorities competent for
macroprudential policy would also help to increase acceptance of policy
decisions which appear unpopular at first sight. In this respect, [by
emphasizing the importance of global liquidity as an early warning
indicator, our work provides support for policy actions even in
jurisdictions where domestic developments still appear to be under
control]{.underline}.

5\. Conclusions

In this paper, [we examine the relationship between access to long-term
debt finance and economic volatility at the firm level]{.underline}.
Using an approach similar to Rajan and Zingales (1998), we find that
[for firms with a greater demand for long-term debt, a greater
availability of long-term debt finance]{.underline}, as proxied by
different measures of financial development, **[reduces firm
volatility]{.underline}**. This could reflect that a [greater
availability of long-term finance mitigates the refinancing
risks]{.underline} associated with the requirement to continually roll
over short-term credit.

[Investigating the period before and after the global financial crisis
separately, we see that the negative impact of the availability of
long-term bank finance on firm volatility holds for the full sample
period of 1995--2013]{.underline}. However, when we proxy financial
development by bond market development, we see that the contribution of
bond market development to reducing firm volatility is only found in the
later period, perhaps because bond finance can be substituted to make up
for the reduction in long-term bank finance during crisis periods.

Further, we show that [adequate info]{.underline}rmation [availability
and a high-quality contracting environment supporting credit markets
**reduce** the negative implication for firm volatility of limited
access to long-term debt, as these factors could **mitigate** the
refinancing risks associated with short-term debt]{.underline}. In
particular, [the refinancing risks associated with short-term finance
appear to be **lower** if accounting standards are high, if legal
institutions support access to credit, contract enforcement and
efficient insolvency resolution, and if the government operates
effectively]{.underline}.

[Our evidence of a negative relationship between the availability of
long-term debt finance and firm volatility is **robust** to controlling
for overall dependence on external finance]{.underline}. Hence, [our
results suggest that changes in financial development that lengthen the
maturity of credit have a potentially beneficial economic effect in
terms of lower economic volatility, independently of the overall
availability of external finance]{.underline}. For this reason,
countries with limited availability of long-term debt finance resulting
from market failures and policy weaknesses can benefit from policies
that could increase its supply. [Promoting macroeconomic and political
stability, improving the information infrastructure, strengthening legal
institutions including investor protection, and creating a contestable
banking system that is adequately supervised and regulated may be
effective policies in this regard]{.underline}.

When it comes to generating support for climate policy, a warranted
sense of alarm is only half the battle. And the other half-a shared
belief that the problem is solvable-is lagging far behind. The newfound
sense of urgency is at risk of being swamped by collective despair. A
scant six percent of Americans, according to the Yale study, believe
that the world \"can and will\" effectively address climate change. With
[carbon dioxide emissions]{.underline} from fossil fuels having [risen
by an estimated 2.7 percent]{.underline} in 2018 [and atmospheric
concentrations of carbon dioxide]{.underline}, which will determine the
ultimate extent of warming, at their highest level in some three million
years, such [pessimism may seem justified]{.underline}-especially with a
climate change denier in the White House. But [it is not too late to
solve the]{.underline} global [climate crisis]{.underline}. A decade of
**[extraordinary innovation]{.underline}** has **[made the greening of
the global economy not only feasible but]{.underline}** also
**[likely]{.underline}**. [The market]{.underline} now [favors clean
energy]{.underline}: in many U.S. states, [it is cheaper to build new
renewable energy plants than]{.underline} to [run existing
coal]{.underline}-fired power [plants]{.underline}. By combining solar
power with new, efficient batteries, Arizona and other sunny states will
soon be able to provide electricity at a lower cost per megawatthour
than new, efficient natural gas plants. Local, **[regional, and federal
governments, as well as corporations, are making]{.underline}**
measurable **[progress on reducing carbon pollution]{.underline}**.
Since 2000, [21 countries have reduced]{.underline} their annual
[greenhouse gas emissions while growing their economies]{.underline};
China is expected to see emissions peak by 2025, five years earlier than
it promised as part of the negotiations for the Paris climate agreement
in 2015. At the UN climate talks held late last year in Poland,
countries agreed on rules for how to report progress on meeting
emission-reduction commitments, an important step in implementing the
Paris accord. What\'s more, an entirely new arsenal is emerging in the
fight against climate change: **[negative emission
technologies]{.underline}**, or nets. Nets **[are different from
conventional approaches to climate mitigation]{.underline}** in that
[they seek]{.underline} not to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases
emitted into the atmosphere but [to remove carbon dioxide that\'s
already there]{.underline}. These technologies range from the
old-fashioned practice of reforestation to high-tech machines that suck
carbon out of the sky and store it underground. The window of
opportunity to combat climate change has not closed-and with a push from
policymakers, nets can keep it propped open for longer. THE HEAT IS ON
[How much time is left]{.underline} to avoid climate catastrophe? [The
truth is]{.underline} that it is [impossible to answer]{.underline} the
question [with precision]{.underline}. [Scientists know]{.underline}
that [human activity is warming]{.underline} the planet [but still
don\'t fully understand]{.underline} the [sensitivity of the
climate]{.underline} system to greenhouse gases. Nor do they fully
comprehend the link between average global warming and local
repercussions. So far, however, most effects of climate change have been
faster and more severe than the climate models predicted. The
**[downside risks are enormous]{.underline}**; the most recent
predictions, ever more dire. The Paris agreement aims to limit the
increase in global average temperatures above preindustrial levels to
well below two degrees Celsius, and ideally to no more than 1.5 degrees
Celsius. Going above those levels of warming would mean more disastrous
impacts. Global average temperatures have already risen by about one
degree Celsius since 1880, with two-thirds of that increase occurring
after 1975. An October 2018 special report by the un\'s
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a body of leading scientists
and policymakers from around the world, found that unless the world
implements \"rapid and far-reaching\" changes to its energy and
industrial systems, the earth is likely to reach temperatures of 1.5
degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels sometime between 2030 and
2052. Limiting warming to that level, the ipcc found, would require
immediate and dramatic cuts in carbon dioxide: roughly a 45 percent
reduction in the next dozen years. Even meeting the less ambitious
target of two degrees would require deep cuts in emissions by 2030 and
sustained aggressive action far beyond then. The ipcc report also warns
that seemingly small global temperature increases can have enormous
consequences. For example, the half-degree difference between 1.5
degrees Celsius and two degrees Celsius of total warming could consign
twice as many people to water scarcity, put ten million more at risk
from rising sea levels, and plunge several hundred million more people
into poverty as lower yields of key crops drive hunger across much of
the developing world. At two degrees of warming, nearly all of the
planet\'s coral reefs are expected to be lost; at 1.5 degrees, ten to 30
percent could survive. The deeper message of the IPCC report is that
**[there is no risk-free level of climate change]{.underline}**. Targets
such as 1.5 degrees Celsius or two degrees Celsius are important
political markers, but they shouldn\'t fool anyone into thinking that
nature works so precisely. Just as the risks are lower at 1.5 degrees
Celsius than at two degrees Celsius, so are they lower at two degrees
Celsius than at 2.5 degrees Celsius. Indeed, the latter difference would
be far more destructive, since the damages mount exponentially as
temperatures rise. [To manage]{.underline} the [enormous risks of
climate change, global emissions]{.underline} of greenhouse gases [need
to be cut sharply]{.underline}, and as soon as possible. That will
require transforming energy, land, transport, and industrial systems so
they emit less carbon dioxide. It will also require reducing short-lived
climate pollutants such as methane, which stay in the atmosphere for
only a fraction of the time that carbon dioxide does but have a
disproportionate effect on near-term warming. Yet even **[that will not
be enough]{.underline}**. [To stabilize the total atmospheric
concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases \[GHGs\], the
world will have to reach **net negative emissions-**]{.underline}that
is, taking more greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere than are being
pumped into it. [Achieving that through emission reductions]{.underline}
alone will be extremely difficult, [since some emissions]{.underline},
such as of methane and nitrous oxide from agriculture, [are]{.underline}
nearly [impossible to eliminate]{.underline}.
**[Countering]{.underline}** the **[emissions]{.underline}** that are
hardest to abate, and bring concentrations down to safer levels,
**[requires technologies that]{.underline}** actually remove **[carbon
dioxide from the atmosphere]{.underline}**. That\'s where nets come
in-not as a substitute for aggressive efforts to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions but as a complement. [By deploying technology that removes
existing carbon dioxide]{.underline} from the atmosphere, while
accelerating cuts in emissions, [the world can]{.underline} boost its
chances of keeping warming below two degrees and [reduce the risk of
catastrophe]{.underline}. Scientists and activists have tended to regard
these technologies as a fallback option, to be held in reserve in case
other efforts fail. Many fear that jumping ahead to carbon dioxide
removal will distract from the critical need to cut pollution. But
**[the world no longer has the luxury of waiting for emission-reduction
strategies]{.underline}** to do the job **[alone]{.underline}**. Far
from being a Plan B, nets must be a critical part of Plan A. What\'s
more, [embracing nets sooner rather than later makes economic
sense]{.underline}. Because the marginal costs of emission reductions
rise as more emissions are cut, [it will be cheaper to deploy nets at
the same time as emission-reduction technologies rather than
waiting]{.underline} to exhaust those options first. The wider the
solution set, the lower the costs. And the lower the costs, the easier
it is to raise ambitions and garner the necessary political support. THE
FUTURE IS NOW Even though removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
may sound like the stuff of science fiction, **[there are already nets
that could be deployed]{.underline}** at scale **[today]{.underline}**,
according to a seminal report released by the National Academies of
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in October 2018. One category
involves taking advantage of carbon sinks-the earth\'s forests and
agricultural soils, which have soaked up more carbon dioxide since the
Industrial Revolution than has been released from burning petroleum. To
date, the growth of carbon sinks has been inadvertent: in the United
States, for example, as agriculture shifted from the rocky soils of the
Northeast to the fertile Midwest, forests reclaimed abandoned farmland,
breathing in carbon dioxide in the process. But this natural process can
be improved through better forest management-letting trees grow longer
before they are harvested and helping degraded forests grow back more
quickly. The large-scale planting of trees in suitable locations around
the world could increase carbon sinks further, a process that must go
hand in hand with efforts to curb tropical deforestation and thereby
continue to contain the vast amounts of carbon already stored in the
earth\'s rainforests. Farmland provides additional potential for
negative emissions. Around the world, conventional agricultural
practices have reduced the amount of carbon in soils, decreasing their
fertility in the process. Smarter approaches can reverse the process.
Small and large landholders alike could add agricultural waste to soil,
maximize the time that the soil is covered by living plants or mulch,
and reduce tilling, which releases carbon dioxide. All these steps would
decrease the amount of carbon that is lost from soil and increase the
amount of carbon that is stored in it. [The most technologically
sophisticated net]{.underline} available in the near term
[is]{.underline} known as \"bioenergy with [carbon capture and
storage]{.underline},\" **[or BECCS]{.underline}**. It is also the
riskiest. Broadly defined, beccs involves burning or fermenting biomass,
such as trees or crops, to generate electricity or make liquid fuel;
capturing the carbon dioxide produced in the process; and sequestering
it underground. [It is]{.underline} considered [a negative emission
technology]{.underline}, and not a zero emission technology, [because
growing]{.underline} the [biomass]{.underline} used in the process
[removes carbon from the atmosphere]{.underline}. **[What makes
BECCS]{.underline}** so **[exciting is its potential to
remove]{.underline}** significantly **[more carbon]{.underline}** from
the atmosphere **[than other approaches do]{.underline}**. But it also
brings challenges. For one, it is expensive: electricity generated from
beccs could cost twice as much as that generated with natural gas,
because biomass is an inefficient fuel source and capturing and
sequestering carbon dioxide is costly. The technology would also require
careful monitoring to ensure that the carbon dioxide pumped underground
stays there and clear rules for legal liability in the event of leaks.
But [the fact that private companies have been successfully injecting
carbon dioxide into depleted oil and gas reservoirs]{.underline} for
decades [offers good evidence]{.underline} that [permanent storage is
possible on a large scale]{.underline}. More worrying are the additional
climate risks that BECCS poses. If BECCS drives demand for biomass and
more of the carbon that is stored in the forest ecosystem is released as
a result, it could end up raising the level of carbon in the atmosphere
rather than reducing it. Another concern is competition for land:
converting farms or forests to grow energy crops, something that the
large-scale use of BEccs might require, could drive up the cost of food,
reduce agricultural production, and threaten scarce habitats. These
problems could be mitigated by using only biomass waste, such as
residues from logging and agriculture, but that would reduce the
potential scale. Although BEccs deserves consideration as part of the
arsenal, these risks mean that its contribution will likely end up being
smaller than some proponents claim. Taking all these land-based nets
together, and factoring in the considerable economic, practical, and
behavioral hurdles to bringing them to scale, the National Academies
report concludes that **[by midcentury, nets could remove]{.underline}**
as much as **[five billion tons of carbon dioxide]{.underline}** from
the atmosphere **[annually]{.underline}**. Given the significant risks
involved, that estimate is probably too bullish. Even if it were not,
that\'s still only half of the ten billion tons of carbon dioxide that
will likely need to be removed each year to zero out the remaining
greenhouse gas emissions, even with aggressive cuts. CLOSING THE GAP
[Removing]{.underline} from the atmosphere the balance of the [carbon
dioxide]{.underline} necessary [will require perfecting technologies
currently in development]{.underline}. Two deserve particular mention;
both are full of promise, although neither is ready for widespread use.
The first is called \"**[direct air capture]{.underline}**\"-
essentially, sucking carbon from the sky. The technology
**[is]{.underline}** already **[being tested]{.underline}** in Canada,
Iceland, Italy, and Switzerland at pilot plants where massive arrays of
fans direct a stream of air toward a special substance that binds with
the passing carbon dioxide. The substance is then either heated or
forced into a vacuum to release the carbon dioxide, which is compressed
and either stored or used as feedstocks for chemicals, fuels, or cement.
These [technologies are real-albeit]{.underline} prohibitively
[expensive]{.underline} in their current form. As a recent study led by
David Sandalow of Columbia University\'s Center on Global Energy Policy
concludes, [taking them to scale means solving]{.underline} a variety of
[technological challenges]{.underline} to bring down the costs. Above
all, these processes are highly energy intensive, so scaling them would
require enormous amounts of low-carbon electricity. (A
direct-air-capture facility powered by coal-fired electricity, for
example, would generate more new carbon dioxide than it would capture.)
These obstacles are serious, but the surprising
**[progress]{.underline}** of the past decade **[suggests]{.underline}**
that **[they can]{.underline}** be **[overcome]{.underline}** in the
next one. The second technology, enhanced [carbon
mineralization]{.underline}, is even further from being realized, but it
[is full of]{.underline} even more [possibility]{.underline}. Geologists
have long known that [when rock from the earth\'s mantle]{.underline}
(the layer of the earth between its crust and its core) [is exposed
to]{.underline} the [air, it binds with carbon dioxide]{.underline} to
form carbon-containing minerals. The massive tectonic collisions that
formed the Appalachian Mountains around 460 million years ago, for
example, exposed subsurface rock to weathering that resulted in the
absorption of substantial amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
That took tens of millions of years; enhanced carbon mineralization
seeks to fast-forward the process. Scientists are exploring two ways to
do this. In one approach, rocks would be brought to the surface to bind
with carbon from the air. Such natural weathering already occurs in mine
tailings, the waste left over from certain mining operations. But
mimicking this process on a large scale-by grinding up large quantities
of rock containing reactive minerals and bringing it to the earth\'s
surface-would be highly energy intensive and thus costly, roughly on par
with direct air capture. **[Another]{.underline}** potential approach
**[is pumping]{.underline}** the **[carbon dioxide
underground]{.underline}** to meet the rock. As the National Academies
report explains, [carbon-dioxide]{.underline}-rich [fluids injected into
basalt or peridotite]{.underline} formations (two kinds of igneous rock
that make up much of the earth\'s mantle) [react with the rock,
converting]{.underline} the [dissolved carbon dioxide into solid
carbon-containing minerals]{.underline}. [Pilot projects]{.underline} in
Iceland and the United States have [demonstrated]{.underline} that [this
is possible]{.underline}. There is also evidence for how this could work
in the natural world. Peridotite usually lies deep inside the earth, but
some rock formations around the globe contain pockets of it on the
surface. For example, scientists are studying how the surface-level
peridotite in Oman\'s rock formations reacts with the air and absorbs
large amounts of carbon. In theory, this approach offers nearly
unlimited scale, because suitable rock formations are widespread and
readily accessible. It would also be cheap, because it takes advantage
of chemical potential energy in the rock instead of costly energy
sources. And **[since]{.underline}** the **[carbon dioxide is converted
to solid rock, the effect is permanent]{.underline}**, and it carries
few of the side effects that other nets could bring. GETTING TO LESS
These technologies do not come cheap. The National Academy of Sciences
recommends as much as \$1 billion annually in U.S. government funding
for research on nets. And indeed, such funding should be an urgent
priority. But [to make]{.underline} these [technologies economically
viable and scale them rapidly, policymakers will]{.underline} also [have
to tap into]{.underline} a much more powerful force: **[the profit
motive]{.underline}**. [Putting a price on carbon emissions creates an
economic incentive]{.underline} for entrepreneurs [to find cheaper,
faster ways to cut pollution]{.underline}. Valuing negative
emissions-for example, through an emission-trading system that awards
credits for carbon removal or a carbon tax that provides rebates for
them-would create an incentive for them to join the hunt for nets.
Forty-five countries, along with ten U.S. states, have put in place some
mechanism to price carbon. But only a handful of them offer rewards for
converting land into forest, managing existing forests better, or
increasing the amount of carbon stored in agricultural soils, and none
offers incentives for other nets. What\'s needed is a carbon pricing
system that not only charges those who emit carbon but also pays those
who remove it. Such **[a system would provide new revenue streams for
landowners who restored forest cover]{.underline}** to their land **[and
for farmers and ranchers who increased]{.underline}** the amount of
**[carbon stored in their soils]{.underline}**. [It would]{.underline}
also [reward]{.underline} the [inventors and entrepreneurs who developed
new, better technologies to capture carbon]{.underline} from the air and
the investors and businesses that took them to scale. Without these
incentives, those players will stay on the sidelines. **[By spurring
innovation]{.underline}** in lower-cost nets, **[incentives
would]{.underline}** also **[ease the way politically for]{.underline}**
an ambitious pollution limit-which, ultimately, is necessary for
**[ensuring]{.underline}** that **[the world meets]{.underline}** it
**[climate goals]{.underline}**. Simply put, humanity\'s best hope is to
promise that the next crop of billionaires will be those who figure out
low-cost ways to remove carbon from the sky. The biggest hurdle for such
incentives is the lack of a global market for carbon credits. Hope on
that front, however, is emerging from an unlikely place: aviation.
Currently responsible for roughly two percent of global greenhouse
gases, aviation\'s emissions are expected to triple or quadruple by
midcentury in the absence of effective policies to limit them. But in
2016, faced with the prospect that the eu would start capping the
emissions of flights landing in and taking off from member states, the
un body that governs worldwide air travel, the International Civil
Aviation Organization, agreed to cap emissions from international
flights at 2020 levels. The airline industry supported the agreement,
hoping to avoid the messy regulatory patchwork that might result if the
eu went ahead and states beyond the eu followed suit with their own
approaches. The resulting program, called the Carbon Offsetting and
Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (corsia), requires all
airlines to start reporting emissions this year, and it will begin
enforcing a cap in 2021. Once in full swing, at least 100 countries are
expected to participate, covering at least three-quarters of the
forecast increase in international aviation emissions. Airlines flying
between participating countries will have two ways to comply: they can
lower their emissions (for example, by burning less fuel or switching to
alternative fuels), or they can buy emission-reduction credits from
companies. Because the technologies for reducing airline emissions at
scale are still a long way off, the industry will mostly choose the
second option, relying on carbon credits from reductions in other
sectors. It is estimated that over the first 15 years of corsia, demand
for these credits will reach between 2.5 billion and 3.0 billion
tons-roughly equal to the annual greenhouse gas emissions from the U.S.
power and manufacturing sectors. With this new option to sell
emission-reduction credits to airlines, there is a good possibility that
a pot of gold will await companies that cut or offset their carbon
emissions. In short, corsia could catalyze a global carbon market that
drives investment in low-carbon fuels and technologies-including nets.
To realize its promise, corsia must be implemented properly, and there
are powerful forces working to see that it is not. Some countries,
including ones negotiating on behalf of their state-owned companies, are
trying to rig the system by allowing credits from projects that do not
produce legitimate carbon reductions, such as Brazil\'s effort to allow
the sale of credits from huge hydroelectric dams in the Amazon that have
already been built and paid for (and thus do not represent new
reductions). Allowing such credits into the system could crowd out
potential rewards for genuine reductions. But there are also powerful,
sometimes unexpected allies who stand to gain from a global carbon
market that works. For example, some airlines are motivated to act out
of a fear that millennials, concerned about their carbon footprint, may
eventually begin to shun air travel. The new regulations, by creating
demand for emission reductions and spurring investment in nets to
produce jet fuel, could be the industry\'s best hope of protecting its
reputation-and a critical step toward a broader global carbon market
that moves nets from promising pilot projects to a gamechanging reality.
Skeptics say that nets are too speculative and a possibility only,
perhaps, in the distant future. It is true that these innovations are
not fully understood and that not all of them will pan out. But no group
of scholars and practitioners, no matter how expert, can determine
exactly which technologies should be deployed and when. It is impossible
to predict what future innovations will look like, but that shouldn\'t
stop the world from pursuing them, especially when the threat is so
grave. The fact remains that many **[nets are ready to be
deployed]{.underline}** at scale today, **[and they]{.underline}** might
**[make the difference between]{.underline}** limiting warming to **[two
degrees and failing]{.underline}** to do so. Ultimately, [climate change
will be stopped by creating economic incentives that
unleash]{.underline} the [innovation of the private
sector]{.underline}-not by waiting for the perfect technology to arrive
ready-made, maybe when it\'s already too late. No one is saying that
achieving all of this will be easy, but the road to climate stability
has never been that. Hard does not mean impossible, however, and the
transformative power of [human ingenuity offers an endless source of
hope]{.underline}.

#### Warming is irreversible

\"Carbon dioxide levels hit 'point of no return',\" New York Post,
https://nypost.com/2017/03/21/carbon-dioxide-levels-hit-point-of-no-return/,
accessed 7-3-2019//JDi

The year [2016 set]{.underline} yet [a]{.underline}nother [devastating
record for global warming]{.underline}. Carbon dioxide levels rose more
than 2 parts per million (ppm) for the second year in a row, [[according
to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration]{.underline}.](http://www.noaa.gov/news/carbon-dioxide-levels-rose-at-record-pace-for-2nd-straight-year)
**[Levels rose]{.underline}** 3 ppm **[to 405.1 ppm]{.underline}** in
2016, putting [CO2 at its highest levels in over 10,000
years.]{.underline} [This increase matched]{.underline} the record rise
recorded in [2015, when CO2 levels officially passed 400 ppm, which
climate scientists call the "point of no return."]{.underline} After
this mark, they claim, **[climate change is irreversible]{.underline}**.
"This is a real shock to the atmosphere," Peter Tans, lead scientist of
NOAA's Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network, said in a statement.
"The rate of CO2 growth over the last decade is 100 to 200 times faster
than what the Earth experienced during the transition from the last Ice
Age." The 400-ppm level, known as [the "carbon threshold," was long
used]{.underline} by scientists [as a warning]{.underline} that [once we
passed this mark, the climate cycle would be thrown into
turmoil]{.underline}. From 10,000 years ago to the beginning of the
Industrial Revolution in 1760, CO2 levels averaged around 280 ppm. And
we'll probably never see levels drop below 400 ppm in our lifetime,
according to Tans. **[If the world stopped burning fossil
fuels]{.underline}** right **[this second]{.underline}**, the **[carbon
dioxide would]{.underline}** still **[be trapped in the atmosphere for
the next few decades]{.underline}**. Additionally, 2016 was the hottest
year ever recorded, since measurements began in 1880. And the
record-breaking temperatures have continued into 2017, with February
recording the [month's second-highest-ever
temperatures](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/) across the globe. "The
need for concerted action on climate change has never been so stark nor
the stakes so high," David Reay, an emissions expert at the University
of Edinburgh, [told the
Guardian.](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/21/record-breaking-climate-change-world-uncharted-territory)
On Tuesday, the World Meteorological Organization published its
annual[ State of the Global
Climate,](https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release) noting that
[increasing temperatures]{.underline} have [pushed Earth into "truly
uncharted territory]{.underline}."

\*ppm = parts per million

[There is an excessive]{.underline} volume of [greenhouse
gases]{.underline} (GHGs) [in the atmospheric system and broad
consensus]{.underline} that [this will have]{.underline} [serious
consequences]{.underline} in terms of climate change. Industrial flue
gas emissions include carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (Nox),
hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter and sulphur
dioxide (SO2), which almost all of these emissions are GHGs \[1,2\].
These emissions endanger human health, agricultural crops, forest
species, various ecosystems and the overall environment as they enhance
the greenhouse effect and hence contribute to global climate change
\[3\]. Greenhouse gases emissions contain about 77% CO2 \[4\].
[According to **recent IPCC reports**, the global mean concentration of
CO2]{.underline} in the atmosphere **[is]{.underline}** now close to
**[400 ppm]{.underline}**; however, [the most **comprehensive research**
states]{.underline} that [the safe level of CO2 concentration is **below
350 ppm**]{.underline} \[5\]. Therefore, this paper suggests [a solution
that can]{.underline} both [reduce]{.underline} the pollution caused by
[CO2 emissions and]{.underline} also [utilize]{.underline} that [CO2 to
enhance sustainability]{.underline} for the benefit of future
generations. To achieve this goal, the following objectives has been
set: i. To discover the major source of CO2 emissions and determine its
effect on the environment; ii. To discover measures to mitigate
pollution, which is CCS technologies, find the major challenge of CCS,
and found that the storage and implementation is the major drawback;
iii. To provide an idea [for the use of CO2 as a feedstock of biofuel
production]{.underline}. In the past, the removal of CO2 from the
atmosphere occurred mainly via photosynthesis, in which crops and other
plants naturally consume CO2 and sunlight and release oxygen \[6,7\].
However, due to recent rapid industrial development, plants alone are no
longer able to deal with the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere and remove
it naturally \[8\]. A certain amount of GHGs exists in the atmospheric
system and helps to absorb thermal radiation from the earth\'s surface
and then reemits the radiation back to the earth as shown in Fig. 1. The
greenhouse effect is important because it traps energy and keep the
temperatures on our planet mild and suitable for living things. Without
this, the average temperature on earth would be much lower and incapable
of sustaining life. However, excessive GHGs caused by human activity may
cause the earth\'s temperature to increase drastically and result in
climate change to the detriment of the global ecosystem. Therefore, it
is important to focus on the control of CO2 and promote sustainable
practice in all sectors. Sustainability is defined as a way of meeting
"the needs of current generations without compromising the ability of
future generations to meet their own needs" \[10\]. In order to achieve
sustainability, the three elements of ecology, economy, and equity must
be considered \[11\]. The concept of [sustainability relates
to]{.underline} the [maintenance and enhancement of environmental,
social and economic resources]{.underline} in order [to
meet]{.underline} the [needs of current and future
generations]{.underline}. Therefore, **[renewable resource inputs must
be kept within]{.underline}** the **[regenerative capacities of the
natural system]{.underline}** that generates them. Additionally, the
extraction of non-renewable resources should be minimized and not exceed
the minimum strategic levels \[12,13\]. Rapid economic growth in many
countries has led to pollution and environmental deterioration, and this
issue is becoming more serious worldwide. Therefore, a way needs to be
found to ensure the survival of current and future generations. One of
the significant problems facing the environment currently is the
production of excessive GHGs and other air pollutants. Recent research
has shown that fossil fuel combustion in the industrial sector accounts
for around 56% of CO2 emissions \[14--16\]. Fig. 2 presents the
correlation between CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere and the
earth\'s surface temperature. From the figure, it can be seen that there
has been a significant increase in CO2 emissions and earth\'s
temperature since 1850. It is believed that these emissions will
continue to increase in the future due to industrial development and
economic growth \[8\]. The available research on CO2 mitigation taken
from previous studies is shown in Table 1. The table contains a summary
of the literature on CO2 mitigation. Our review of the available
literature shows that most of the research to date has focused mainly on
carbon capture and sequestration/storage (CCS), whereas only a few
studies have discussed the capture, storage and utilization of carbon
from flue gas emissions. Among these few studies, Luckow et al. \[18\]
focus on capture, sequestration and utilization, although the aspect of
utilization is considered only in relation to a specific sector, namely
the biomass sector. Similarly, Al-Saleh et al. \[19\] focus on CO2
capture, storage and utilization specific to the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) region only. In light of the above, this paper intends to
provide an idea of [the combination of **CCS**]{.underline} technology
**[and]{.underline}** the **[production of biofuel]{.underline}** by
**[using CO2]{.underline}** as a feedstock. It focused on developing the
idea and [stimulating research on]{.underline} the [capture and
utilization of CO2]{.underline} as a means [to address the storage
limitations of current]{.underline} CCS [technology and enhance
**sustainability for**]{.underline} the benefit of **[future
generations]{.underline}**. No research paper is available to fill all
the gaps, whereas, this paper has fulfilled the gap considering capture,
sequestration, utilization and product. 2. Carbon dioxide capture and
sequestration [Carbon capture and sequestration]{.underline} or storage
[is]{.underline} defined as the [removal of CO2]{.underline} directly
[from industrial or utility plants and]{.underline} its subsequent
[storage in a secure medium]{.underline}. It is one of the most
important technologies that can be employed to reduce CO2 emissions
\[26\]. **[The rationale for CCS is to enable]{.underline}** the
**[production of biofuels while reducing CO2 emissions]{.underline}**
into the atmosphere **[and thereby mitigate global climate
change]{.underline}** \[15,20,21,31,38\]. Therefore, when using CCS
technology, the storage period of CO2 should exceed the estimated peak
period of fossil fuel exploitation, such that if CO2 re-emerges into the
atmosphere, it should occur after the predicted peak period of fossil
fuel exploitation. To date, [CCS is the most promising technique for CO2
reduction, and]{.underline} is [feasible for large-scale
sources]{.underline} of CO2 \[39\]. Due to the world\'s large stock of
low-cost fossil fuels, there is a strong requirement to explore

Climate Nationalism and the Alternative The perhaps starkest example of
localist or statist thinking in environmental policy-making can be found
in one of the most global of all issues, namely climate change. In part
due to the intergovernmental nature of the UNFCCC process, [the last
decades have seen rich countries focusing]{.underline} almost
[exclusively on meeting their own marginal emission targets]{.underline}
in the present [rather than asking themselves what it would take to
**decarbonise the global economy as a whole**]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} 'climate nationalist' [paradigm]{.underline} has been
highly problematic for a number of reasons. First it has [led
to]{.underline} the [deployment of 'soft' energy
technologies]{.underline} (Lovins, 1977), [which are neither globally
scalable]{.underline} (Karlsson & Symons, 2015; Moriarty & Honnery,
2012) [nor capable of rapidly displacing fossil fuels]{.underline} at
home (York, 2012). Scalability constraints include geographical
limitations such as the number of damnable rivers suitable for
hydropower or the number of thermal fields suitable for producing
geothermal energy but also more general limitations due to the
diluteness and intermittency of many renewable energy sources. Wind and
solar, although abundant, are both diffuse and variable which make them
unsuitable for providing the concentrated energy needed to power
smelters, process industries or megacities with high grid reliability
standards. Second, and more worryingly, **[the high cost and low energy
returned on]{.underline}** invested numbers of **[renewable
energy]{.underline}** have **[left developing countries with little
choice than to continue building fossil infrastructure]{.underline}**,
in particular, thermal coal power, to meet their growing energy needs
(Weißbach et al., 2013). Clearly, as much as energy saving and other
forms of demand-side management in the rich countries may make sense
within their respective domestic contexts, such measures have the
unfortunate effect of reducing the political interest in financing the
kind of supply-side revolution that is needed globally. Third and
finally, as [it is becoming increasingly clear]{.underline} that
[the]{.underline} politically [agreed target of keeping global warming
below]{.underline} 28C [will not be met by conventional
mitigation]{.underline} alone, [there will]{.underline} most likely [be
a significant need]{.underline} for energy [for carbon dioxide
removal]{.underline} (CDR) but also for adaptation in terms of, for
instance, mass desalination for agricultural purposes, further
underscoring the inadequacies of the current soft energy approach. An
alternative and very different approach to climate nationalism would be
to ask, what kind of technologies would be required to achieve climate
stability in a world of 10+ billion people living prosperous lives?
Starting from that question and working backwards, such an alternative
approach would shift the focus from the immediate deployment of
non-scalable technologies to the innovation of massively scalable
high-energy technologies capable of providing an abundant and cheap
supply of clean baseload electricity (Galiana & Green, 2010). The
underlying premise would be that **[by making clean
energy]{.underline}** significantly **[cheaper than today, it would be
possible to rapidly displace fossil fuels and]{.underline}** effectively
**[overcome political and cultural inertia]{.underline}**. [No
longer]{.underline} economically [competitive, existing fossil
infrastructure would]{.underline} then [be abandoned]{.underline} as
stranded assets, even in those countries that for political reasons may
doubt the seriousness of climate change or those where fossil industries
may hold a strong political influence. Most importantly, **[such an
approach would give developing countries]{.underline}** the **[reliable
energy they need to move away from fossil fuels]{.underline}** at the
same time as they can universalise access to modern energy services.
Currently, indoor air pollution from the burning of wood and charcoal
causes millions of premature deaths annually while simultaneously
driving deforestation. Given its inherent merits, not the least its
potential to once and for all resolve long-running North--South tensions
in international environmental debates (Williams, 2005), it may perhaps
seem strange that such an advanced technological path to climate
stability has not been widely considered in the literature (Dorr, 2016;
Green, 2015; Symons & Karlsson, 2015). There are, of course, many
reasons for this, in particular the fact that since the most obvious
such 'high-energy' technology would be nuclear power, it would mean
moving into a minefield of political risk. Despite more than 60 years of
civilian nuclear power with extremely few fatalities compared to fossil
energy (it is, for instance, worth noting that no one has yet died from
radiation after the Fukushima accident in 2011), public perception of
the risk of nuclear energy has been unforgiving. Given that there seems
to be no hope for a rational discussion on the risks of nuclear compared
to those of uncontrollable climate change, it may matter surprisingly
little to know that if all of the world were to build nuclear power at
the same per capita rate that Sweden and France did during the 1970s and
1980s, then coal- and gas-fired electricity could be replaced worldwide
within a few decades or less (Qvist & Brook, 2015). However, in addition
to other concerns such as proliferation (Socolow & Glaser, 2009),
existing nuclear designs are highly brittle in the sense that one single
major accident could potentially mean an end to expansion plans
everywhere. Given the limited remaining carbon budget if catastrophic
climate change is to be avoided, such fragility is obviously a strong
argument against making a global mitigation strategy dependent on
existing nuclear designs. Accepting that puts the focus back on
fundamental energy R&D. While nuclear technologies broadly conceived are
likely to play an important part in any high-energy future, finding an
energy source which is proliferation-resistant, passive safe, and which
has an abundant supply of fuel that would allow it to generate baseload
electricity at a cost far below fossil sources will require nothing
short of an energy miracle. When Darrel Moellendorf writes that hoping
for such a technological breakthrough 'hardly amounts to a basis for
responsible policy' (Moellendorf, 2014, p. 183), he gives voice to a
commonsensical view, which is widely shared in the climate policy
community. Obviously, committing vast social resources to fundamentally
uncertain research makes little sense if there is a meaningful
alternative. Yet, after more than two decades marked by an ever more
polarised climate debate (Keller, 2015, p. 223), it should be obvious
that current mitigation efforts are failing (Jamieson, 2014). Even if
the progressive offshoring of carbon-intensive industries may have
helped in improving the carbon inventories of certain rich countries,
overall emissions (in particular when including aviation and shipping)
have steadily gone up since the inception of the Kyoto Protocol. The
prospect of brute force mitigation through directly reduced consumption
rates, as envisioned by many Greens and theorists alike (Harris, 2010),
seem as remote as ever. Contrary to the hopes of Greenpeace and other
environmental NGOs, Germany, which has taken on itself to lead the world
into a future of renewable energy, has seen rising carbon emissions for
several years following the phase-out of nuclear energy. At a global
level, the share of coal power in the world's energy mix has not been
higher since the 1970s and the overall share of carbon fuels in the
total energy consumption has remained more or less stable around 86--87%
since 2000 (British Petroleum, 2015). Over time, however, it is likely
that the very richest countries, which have sufficient numbers of
affluent consumers who can afford to pay higher energy prices, will be
able to complete the shift to small-scale renewable energy sources,
especially if much of their overall physical infrastructure is produced
elsewhere and the intermittency problem can be solved through energy
storage (and not as today by fossil backup capacity). Yet, simple
back-of-the-envelope calculations show that providing the several
thousand exajoules of clean energy annually that would be needed for a
global economic convergence is more or less impossible using such
technologies (Trainer, 2013). That is one of the reasons why almost
**[all climate scenarios that succeed in stabilising the
climate]{.underline}** over the course of the twenty-first century **[do
so by inserting austere assumptions with regard to energy
access]{.underline}** and, thus, overall energy demand (Pielke, Wigley,
& Green, 2008). In less technical language, [such
restrictions]{.underline} essentially [mean that the poor stay poor deep
into the future]{.underline}. Considering this, the connection between
climate nationalist thinking and the current state of incomplete
globalisation becomes readily visible. According to the standard
Malthusian narrative, technology can never 'keep up with growth in
population, affluence, and consumption' (Mitchell, 2012, p. 25). As a
consequence, the only hope of achieving climate stability hinges on
constraining population growth and overall human welfare. Despite its
dubious ethical implications, such an argument would perhaps make sense
if fairly marginal reductions in growth rates would be sufficient to
achieve longterm sustainability. Yet, given how deeply unsustainable the
very metabolism of modern industrial society is, this is obviously not
the case. In a world of 7.3 billion people, [the reductions in economic
activity would have to be of an almost apocalyptic magnitude to bring
down]{.underline} per capita [emission levels]{.underline} so that they
would be lower than what is absorbed by natural sequestration processes.
Given the political impossibility of achieving such dramatic reductions
in the rich countries, **[it is not surprising]{.underline}** that the
**[political attention]{.underline}** has **[shifted to]{.underline}**
the task of **[keeping poor people away from fossil forms of
development]{.underline}**, something which in fact has already become
the explicit goal of many environmental NGOs but also a kind of 'carbon
conditionality' imposed by for instance the U.S. Agency for
International Development's 'Power Africa' initiative. While much can be
said about the morality of imposing such double standards at home and
abroad, respectively, [the most apparent implication of this
is]{.underline} that [the poor will]{.underline} in effect [stay
poor]{.underline}. Even if distributed solar panels may be sufficient
for charging a cell phone or powering a reading lamp at night, the
**[energy provided is of a completely different scale compared to what
was needed for]{.underline}** the sweeping **[modernisation processes
that made broadly shared prosperity possible]{.underline}** in Europe,
North America and, most recently, North-East Asia. **[Psychologically
unrealistic]{.underline}** as **[it may be to expect the poor to
remain]{.underline}** **[content]{.underline}** with **[being locked out
from modernity]{.underline}** in this way, [the current state of
incomplete globalisation is likely to]{.underline} frustrate or at least
[delay their rise]{.underline}. While this may ostensibly win some time
in terms of lower carbon emissions, **[it will]{.underline}** also
**[have]{.underline}** many **[countervailing effects such as delaying
the]{.underline}** demographic **[transition that would
follow]{.underline}** from more **[comprehensive forms of modernisation
or prolong]{.underline}** the **[use of informal fuels]{.underline}**.
[Failure to fully integrate]{.underline} the world [will]{.underline}
also [have]{.underline} another [important effect for the transition to
sustainability, namely to slow overall]{.underline} global [growth
rates]{.underline}. [While it is fashionable]{.underline} in more
critical literature [to suggest]{.underline} that the [marginal utility
of]{.underline} further [economic growth has become
negative]{.underline} in the advanced economies (Jackson, 2011), [this
is to grossly misunderstand contemporary economic and political
dynamics]{.underline}. Not only is [further economic growth
indispensable to]{.underline} ensure the financial stability of
retirement schemes and to pay the health costs associated with an ageing
population, it is in fact the very life elixir of society as it
[lessen]{.underline}s distributional [conflicts and encourages public
risk-taking]{.underline} (Friedman, 2006). **[Only in]{.underline}** a
situation of **[strong economic growth are politicians likely to
make]{.underline}** the **[bold investments in energy R&D]{.underline}**
needed to bring about the kind of 'high-energy miracle' discussed above.
As a consequence, [it is possible to see an indirect link between
failure to integrate the world and]{.underline} the [prospects
of]{.underline} financing [breakthrough innovation]{.underline}. Yet,
[beyond this]{.underline} indirect link, [there is a much more direct
link in terms of]{.underline} the [costs of violent
conflict]{.underline} caused by global inequality, the [policing of
borders, and]{.underline} the [risks of pandemics]{.underline} (as most
recently seen in the case of Ebola in West Africa), all [diverting
resources]{.underline} away [from]{.underline} more [urgent social
needs, including energy R&D]{.underline}.

Humanity needs to improve when it comes to reducing carbon emissions to
prevent the worst effects of climate change. If the world is to meet the
IPCC\'s minimum target of keeping global temperature increases below 1.5
°C, [every possible avenue for CO2 remediation must be
explored]{.underline}. **[Geological trapping can play a major
role]{.underline}** here. Our planet\'s underground [rocks and sediments
offer a vast potential space for long-term carbon storage]{.underline}.
To support this, **[a recent computational study]{.underline}** from a
Japanese-led international group at Kyushu University **[shows how
trapped carbon dioxide can be converted into harmless
minerals]{.underline}**. The [rocks beneath the]{.underline} earth\'s
[surface are]{.underline} highly [porous, and trapping involves
injecting CO2 into]{.underline} the [pores after collecting
it]{.underline} from its emission source. Although **[CO2]{.underline}**
is usually considered too stable to react chemically with rock, it
**[can bind tightly to the surface by physical
adsorption]{.underline}**. Eventually [it dissolves in water, forming
carbonic acid]{.underline}, which can react with aqueous metals to form
carbonate minerals. \"**[Mineralization is]{.underline}** the most
**[stable]{.underline}** method of long-term CO2 storage, **[locking CO2
into a]{.underline}** completely **[secure form that can\'t be
re-emitted]{.underline}**,\" explains Jihui Jia of the International
Institute for Carbon-Neutral Energy Research (I2CNER), Kyushu
University, first author of the study. \"This was once thought to take
thousands of years, but that view is rapidly changing. The chemical
reactions are not fully understood because they\'re so hard to reproduce
in the lab. This is where modeling comes in.\" As reported in The
Journal of Physical Chemistry C, [simulations were]{.underline}
initially [run to predict what happens when carbon dioxide collides with
a cleaved quartz surface]{.underline} \-- quartz (SiO2) being abundant
in the earth\'s crust. When the simulation trajectories were played
back, the [CO2 molecules were seen bending]{.underline} from their
linear O=C=O shape [to form trigonal CO3 units]{.underline} bonded with
the quartz. In a second round of simulations, H2O molecules were added
to mimic the \"formation water\" that is often present beneath oil and
gas drilling sites. Intriguingly, the H2O molecules spontaneously
attacked the reactive CO3 structures, breaking the Si-O bonds to produce
carbonate ions. Just like carbonic acid, carbonate ions can react with
dissolved metal cations (such as Mg2+, Ca2+, and Fe2+) to bind carbon
permanently into mineral form. Together, the simulations show that both
steps of CO2mineralization \-- carbonation (binding to rock) and
hydrolysis (reacting with water) \-- are favorable. Moreover, free
carbonate ions can be made by hydrolysis, not just by dissociation of
carbonic acid as was once assumed. These insights relied on a
sophisticated form of molecular dynamics that models not just the
physical collisions between atoms, but electron transfer, the essence of
chemistry. \"Our results suggest some ways to improve geological
trapping,\" says study lead author Takeshi Tsuji. \"For quartz to
capture CO2, it must be a cleaved surface, so the silicon and oxygen
atoms have reactive \'dangling\' bonds. In real life, however, the
surface might be protected by hydrogen bonding and cations, which would
prevent mineralization. We need a way to strip off those cations or
dehydrogenate the surface.\" Evidence is growing that **[captured CO2
can mineralize]{.underline}** much **[faster than previously
believed]{.underline}**. While this is exciting, the Kyushu paper
underlines how complex and delicate the chemistry can be. For now, the
group recommends further studies on other abundant rocks, like basalt,
to map out the role that geochemical trapping can play in the greatest
technical challenge facing civilization.

In a field in northern British Columbia, a white [mineral covering the
ground]{.underline}--magnesite, also called magnesium carbonate--[has
slowly been sequestering CO2 from the atmosphere since the]{.underline}
last [ice age]{.underline}. That's very helpful: We need to sequester
more carbon. But the small crystals of the mineral, made by taking CO2
from the air, can take hundreds of thousands of years to grow, and we
need fixes that work faster than that. In a Canadian lab, **[researchers
recently demonstrated]{.underline}** that **[they could speed up the
process]{.underline}** to 72 days. [It's something that
could]{.underline} potentially [happen at a large scale to]{.underline}
help [fight climate change, since a metric ton of magnesite
can]{.underline} [capture half a]{.underline} metric [ton of
CO2]{.underline} (the world emitted 32.5 gigatons of carbon in 2017).
Other scientists have also experimented with other ways to speed up this
type of "CO2 mineralization." But while other processes often involve
high heat and a lot of energy, **[the new process can happen at room
temperature, so it should be cheaper]{.underline}**. "Other researchers
have looked at forming this mineral using high-temperature,
high-pressure reactors," says Ian Power, an environmental geoscientist
and professor at Trent University in Canada. "You can form this mineral
quite quickly under those sorts of higher conditions. But higher
temperature, higher pressure, usually means more energy input, which
could ultimately be more expensive. That's the real challenge with
trying to sequester CO2 at a large scale--technologies do exist, we know
how to do it, but trying to do it economically." In the lab, Power and
his colleagues used [a reactive surface with a negative
charge]{.underline} that [attracts positively-charged magnesium ions to
speed up]{.underline} a part of [the process]{.underline} of [forming
the mineral]{.underline}. In industrial reactors, **[the]{.underline}**
same **[process could]{.underline}** potentially **[happen at a large
scale]{.underline}**. [The process could]{.underline} potentially
[happen at power plants or other]{.underline} direct [sources of
pollution]{.underline}, or in the ocean, or it could possibly take CO2
from the air. Some other approaches to capture CO2--for example, from
the exhaust at a power plant--envision injecting it deep underground to
store it, a process that risks leaks. Processes that form a mineral
could be more secure. **[The mineral could be used for long-term storage
or]{.underline}** might be **[used in industry]{.underline}** (magnesite
is currently mined for some industrial uses). [Carbon capture and
storage is]{.underline} a nascent field, particularly when it comes to
technology that could sequester carbon directly from the atmosphere; the
first commercial plant to directly suck CO2 from the air opened only
last year, [sitting on top of a waste incineration plant in
Switzerland](https://www.fastcompany.com/40421871/this-machine-just-started-sucking-co2-out-of-the-air-to-save-us-from-climate-change).
But it's [the type of technology that the UN's]{.underline} massive
[report on climate change says]{.underline} [is
[necessary](https://www.wired.com/story/the-dirty-secret-of-the-worlds-plan-to-avert-climate-disaster/)]{.underline}
in most of the scenarios that it considers [for how the planet can avoid
catastrophic climate change]{.underline}. Climate change is already
here. Glacier National Park is [on
fire](https://missoulian.com/news/local/howe-ridge-fire-sent-pieces-of-glacier-national-park-s/article_66ea4e07-83bc-558e-8de8-aaa4bc37110d.html).
In July, heat waves in the Arctic set off other unprecedented fires in
Sweden, while extreme rainfall killed 200 people in Japan and displaced
hundreds of thousands of people in Kenya. In South Africa, Cape Town
teetered on the edge of running out of water in March. But **[to avoid
a]{.underline}**n even **[more catastrophic future, the world
needs]{.underline}** to both keep moving to **[a zero-carbon economy and
sequester CO2]{.underline}**. Last year, the amount of carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere tipped above 412 parts per million, higher than it has
been in at least 800,000 years.

[Carbon mineralization]{.underline} is an emerging NET that [pulls
carbon dioxide from the air and stores it in]{.underline} the
[permanent]{.underline} form of [carbonate minerals]{.underline}, such
as calcite or magnesite. Mineralization occurs naturally during the
weathering of silicate materials such as olivine, serpentine, and
wollastonite. It also occurs in rocks rich in calcium and
magnesium---particularly peridotite, which composes Earth's upper
mantle, and basaltic lava formed by partial melting of the upper mantle.
**[Mineralization takes advantage of rocks that geological
processes]{.underline}** have **[brought from deep within
Earth]{.underline}** up near or to the surface, where they are far from
equilibrium **[and therefore reactive]{.underline}**. Because
[mineralization uses this naturally available chemical
energy]{.underline}, the approach may offer a low-cost means to mitigate
greenhouse gas emissions. And [because the CO2 is locked in solid
carbonate minerals, storage is]{.underline} potentially [permanent and
nontoxic]{.underline}. Carbon can be sequestered through mineralization
in three main ways, the National Academies report says. One approach,
called ex situ carbon mineralization, involves transporting rocks to a
site of CO2capture, where the reactants are combined with fluid or gas
rich in CO2. Another process involves reacting a CO2-bearing fluid or
gas with mine waste, alkaline industrial wastes, or sedimentary
formations rich in reactive rock fragments. A third method, called in
situ carbon mineralization, circulates CO2-bearing fluids through
suitably reactive rock formations beneath Earth's surface. Carbon
mineralization is not a new concept. Researchers have been investigating
its potential to capture atmospheric CO2 for three decades. A recent
study found that **[chemical reactions]{.underline}** in common basalt
rock [**[can convert CO2 into solid minerals]{.underline}** in less than
two
years](https://cen.acs.org/articles/94/i24/Rock-chemistry-solidify-CO2-storage.html)---**[dramatically
faster than]{.underline}** the hundreds or thousands of years
**[previously estimated]{.underline}** (Science 2016, [DOI:
10.1126/science.aad8132](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aad8132)).
However, [mineralization could suffer from]{.underline} other [resource
problems]{.underline}. For example, the process requires 25 t of water
for every metric ton of CO2 stored. And as with underground
sequestration, it will require the development of transportation
infrastructure.

So [we need to]{.underline} have a little [talk about
concrete]{.underline}. We take it for granted, but concrete is the
foundation (no pun intended) of countless buildings, homes, bridges,
skyscrapers, millions of miles of highways, and some of the most
impressive feats of civil engineering the world has ever known. It's the
most widely-used human-made substance on the planet. It also happens to
be incredibly bad for the climate. Portland cement, the most commonly
used base (the goop that gets mixed with sand and gravel, or aggregate,
to form concrete), is made with limestone that is quarried and then
heated to staggeringly high temperatures --- releasing huge amounts of
carbon dioxide in the process. Add to that all the fuel burned to mine
and crush the aggregate, and you've got a climate disaster. By some
accounts, concrete alone is responsible for 4-8 percent of the world's
CO2 emissions. And it's only getting worse. Between 2011 and 2013, China
used more cement than the United States used in all of the 20th century
--- about enough to pave paradise and put up a parking lot the size of
Hawaii's Big Island. Cement production worldwide could [grow another 23
percent by
2050](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cement-producers-are-developing-a-plan-to-reduce-co2-emissions/).
It's no secret that [we have already blown past]{.underline} the [levels
of climate-altering pollution that scientists warn could have
catastrophic effects]{.underline} on life as we know it. We set a new
CO2 record just last month, notching 411.66 parts per million of CO2 in
the air in Mauna Loa, Hawaii --- far higher than the 300 parts per
million that is the highest humans have ever survived long-term. But [a
solution]{.underline} on the horizon [could switch up the
math]{.underline} completely. **[A new method of creating
concrete]{.underline}** actually **[pulls C02]{.underline}** out of the
air, or directly out of industrial exhaust pipes, **[and turns it into
synthetic limestone]{.underline}**. [The technique]{.underline}, which
has already been demonstrated in California, [is part of a growing
effort to]{.underline} not just [slow the advance of climate
change]{.underline}, but to reverse it, restoring a safe and healthy
climate for ourselves and future generations. To do that, the
[Foundation for Climate
Restoration](https://foundationforclimaterestoration.org/programs/)
estimates that a trillion tons of CO2 must be removed from our
atmosphere on top of additional efforts to curb emissions. The National
Academies of Science agrees that ["negative emissions technologies," as
they're known, are
essential](https://grist.org/article/the-debate-is-over-we-need-to-start-sucking-carbon-from-the-air/).
It's a massive undertaking, but [if we change]{.underline} how we think
about [concrete, capturing a trillion tons of CO2 may not be so
pie-in-the-sky]{.underline} after all. Enter Brent Constantz, a Silicon
Valley entrepreneur and marine geologist, who once treated
[cardiovascular
calcification](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brent_Constantz) and
created bone cements (used in operating rooms to mend broken limbs) by
mimicking the process that corals and shellfish use to create their own
shells. His patents and products are used by doctors around the world.
Developing and testing new medical procedures was perilous work,
Constantz said, although the drive to cure terminal illnesses outweighed
many of the risks involved. That passion lead Constantz to launch a
company in 2012 called [Blue Planet](http://www.blueplanet-ltd.com/),
based in Los Gatos, California. Its goal is "economically sustainable
carbon capture." The company's technology, like his previous work,
builds on the power of corals. Corals turn millions of teeny polyps into
stunning, full-grown reefs through a process known as biomineralization,
Constantz explained. Inspired by this phenomenon, he developed a similar
[**["low-energy
mineralization"]{.underline}**](http://www.blueplanet-ltd.com/#technology)
technique that **[turns]{.underline}** captured **[CO2
into]{.underline}** the same bony stuff that corals secrete: **[calcium
carbonate]{.underline}**. Blue Planet's process starts with collecting
CO2 and dissolving it in a solution. In the process, the company creates
carbonate that reacts with calcium from waste materials or rock to
create calcium carbonate. Calcium carbonate happens to be the main
ingredient in limestone. But rather than superheating it to create
cement (which would release all that CO2 right back into the
atmosphere), Constantz and his team turn the resulting stone into
pebbles that serve as aggregate. This is easiest to do where there's
lots of CO2 --- smokestacks at factories, refineries and power plants,
for example --- but it can also come from "direct air capture," using
less concentrated air anywhere, a technology whose costs are rapidly
declining. [Do this on a large scale]{.underline}, Constantz said, [and
you could]{.underline} help [satiate the growing global demand for rock
and sand, and make a massive dent in the climate crisis]{.underline} at
the same time: Every ton of Blue Planet's synthetic limestone contains
440 kilograms of CO2. While it still needs to be mixed with cement (the
goopy stuff) to make concrete, using this in place of gravel or stone
that needs to be quarried and crushed creates a finished product that is
carbon neutral, if not carbon-negative, according to the company. The
[annual use of
aggregate](http://www.rockproducts.com/features/13045-world-aggregates-market.html#.XKGTOdF7kxM)
is over 50 billion tons and growing fast. **[Making]{.underline}** it
from **[synthetic limestone]{.underline}** instead of quarried rock
**[could sequester 25 billion tons a year]{.underline}** ---
**[meaning]{.underline}** that, in 40 years, **[this
solution]{.underline}** alone **[could]{.underline}** remove a trillion
tons of CO2 from the air, enough to **[restore pre-industrial
levels]{.underline}**. And while most other methods of sequestering
carbon are good for only a short time, limestone is completely stable,
Constantz said. "If we look at the Earth, there's limestone that is
millions of years old, like the White cliffs of Dover." Blue Planet's
limestone, created using emissions collected from the Moss Landing Power
Plant on Monterey Bay and other sources, has already been [added to
concrete](https://www.architectmagazine.com/practice/the-materials-industry-is-pitching-in-to-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions_o)
in areas of San Francisco International Airport. Constantz expects to
open its first commercial production facility in the Bay Area within the
year, producing a little over 300,000 tons of rock annually with C02
captured from an adjacent power plant's exhaust stack. Constantz dreams
of having thousands of plants up and running by 2050, with most of the
resulting rock being used by government agencies to construct roads and
buildings. "[Even the poorest countries]{.underline} in the world [are
still mining rock]{.underline} in open pit mines, [and that's an
important aspect]{.underline} to what we're doing," he said. "There is
already funding out there that is paying for rock. I'm not talking about
increasing government spending a bit."

First, [CCS is not restricted]{.underline} only [to electricity
generation]{.underline}. In an economy where fossil fuel use is
pervasive, **[reduction of emissions through CCS can be applied
to]{.underline}**: (i) upstream [removal of]{.underline} associated
[CO2 produced]{.underline} together [with oil or]{.underline} especially
[gas]{.underline}, (ii) [electricity generation from oil, coal or
gas]{.underline}, (iii) [fuel and process emissions]{.underline} from
large industries, (iv) supply of [heat to domestic and industrial
users]{.underline}, (v) conversion, and especially [combustion, of
modern biomass]{.underline} for heat or feedstock, [and]{.underline}
(vi) [replacement of hydrocarbon fuel in surface transport]{.underline}
with electricity or hydrogen. Consequently, **[it has been an historic
mistake for developed]{.underline}** industrial **[economies to
over-focus on]{.underline}** the **[application of CCS to electricity
generation]{.underline}** from coal with some attention to gas. This has
pitched the final product of decarbonized electricity into a market
where subsidized renewable generation can produce electricity at prices
comparable to or cheaper than conventional high carbon power. CCS then
fails commercially. **[The true value of CCS is its ability to be
applied across the entire economy]{.underline}**.

In the foothills of the Swiss alps, a giant set of industrial fans
whirring loudly on the roof of a waste incinerator hardly resembles an
invention that could save the planet. But these [machines]{.underline}
--- [designed to pull carbon dioxide out of the air]{.underline} ---
[have become]{.underline} one of [the hottest areas of climate-related
investment in recent months]{.underline}. **[Venture capital groups and
global resources companies]{.underline}** including BHP Billiton,
Chevron and Occidental Petroleum, have **[poured tens of millions of
dollars into "direct air capture"]{.underline}** technology this year,
**[at a time of growing concern over climate change]{.underline}**.
While the exact technology varies between the three start-ups that are
operating these DAC facilities, they all share the basic concept of
giant fans pulling air across a contact surface that binds with the CO2
molecules. The contact material is then heated to unbind the CO2, so
that it can be collected. The trio of start-ups have attracted more
capital and attention since global emissions hit a new high last year,
despite the high cost and limited commercial markets for the technology.
"Three years ago, people were like, you are investing in pixie dust and
unicorns," said Julio Friedmann, a researcher at Columbia University's
Center for Global Energy Policy and founder of Carbon Wrangler, a
consultancy that advises DAC start-ups. "It has changed because
[companies now recognize]{.underline} that [climate change is a threat,
and they see this as an essential mitigation tool]{.underline}," Mr
Friedmann added. Last Thursday, Canada-based Carbon Engineering, backed
by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, closed a \$68m fundraising round,
with investors including BHP, Chevron and First Round Capital. In
Switzerland, DAC start-up Climeworks has raised a total of SFr50m
(\$50.1m) and has 14 plants operating around the world. Jan Wurzbacher,
its co-founder, has lofty ambitions. "Our vision is to capture 1 per
cent of global emissions. That requires a lot of capital," he said.
Meanwhile, New York-based Global Thermostat, which previously raised
\$42m in three rounds from 2010-17, is in the middle of a new \$20m
fundraising round. **[The chemical process to extract CO2 is not
new]{.underline}** --- it was even used during the second world war
where CO2 scrubbers helped maintain breathable air in the confined space
of submarines. However, [as an environmental strategy, the
concept]{.underline} of DAC [was largely dismissed until
recently]{.underline}, largely [because of the cost]{.underline} of
building the machines [and the energy required]{.underline} to run the
process. Now, **[an increasing number of scientists believe pulling
CO2]{.underline}** out of the atmosphere --- once considered an
improbable long-shot --- **[will be]{.underline}** part of **[the answer
for limiting global warming]{.underline}**. "Our ignoring the climate
change problem for so long has eliminated our other options," said Klaus
Lackner, a professor at Arizona State University and director of the
Center for Negative Carbon Emissions. "The problem, left to itself, only
gets bigger." Last October [a report from the UN **I**ntergovernmental
**P**anel on **C**limate **C**hange found]{.underline} that some form of
[CO2 removal would be needed to limit global warming]{.underline} to
1.5C compared with pre-industrial times, [even if the world started
cutting emissions]{.underline} immediately. It forecast that between
100bn-1,000bn tonnes of CO2 will need to be removed during this century.

Second, that [achieving a]{.underline} national and [global balance for
greenhouse gas emissions]{.underline} (**[net-zero
balance]{.underline}**), either by mid-century, or much more urgently
[to limit temperature rise above 1.5°C, requires]{.underline} more than
just attention to energy, and [more than just]{.underline} attention to
[decarbonization]{.underline}. **[This is a fundamental all-economy
inventory, which has not]{.underline}** yet **[been
widely]{.underline}** and comprehensively **[realized]{.underline}**
([figure
3](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsta.2016.0447#RSTA20160447F3)).
Here, we cite the example of Scotland: a small industrial country with a
large ambition to be a leader in climate action. Scotland has seen
closure of many large legacy industries from coal burning and
industrialization. Thus Scotland forms an example of where many
industrial economies may find themselves in the mid-to-late 2020s once
'easy\' actions of high carbon closure have been taken. What is left to
do? [Figure
3](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsta.2016.0447#RSTA20160447F3)
shows that [great progress has been made]{.underline} since 1990 by
[reducing emissions of fossil carbon]{.underline} in the energy sector.
[However]{.underline}, to make [further progress]{.underline} towards
zero emissions [requires actions on]{.underline} greenhouse gas sources
such as agricultural [land use, refrigerants and industrial]{.underline}
process [emissions]{.underline}. Although reducing emissions from energy
is a crucial first step, **[most industrial economies]{.underline}**
typically **[emit 30% of greenhouse gases from non-energy
sources.]{.underline}**

Is climate change reversible? [The
[IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf)
considers]{.underline} some additional [warming
irreversible]{.underline}. They say "**[Many aspects of climate change
and associated impacts will continue for centuries, even
if]{.underline}** anthropogenic **[emissions]{.underline}** of
greenhouse gases **[are stopped]{.underline}**. The [risks of abrupt or
irreversible changes increase as]{.underline} the magnitude of the
[warming increases]{.underline}." [Per]{.underline} the [models cited in
the IPCC assessments, anthropogenic climate change can be
halted]{.underline} at 2 degrees, [although [this
scenario](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10584-011-0152-3)
requires **negative industry and energy-related CO2
emissions**]{.underline} later this century. By this interpretation, a
tipping point has not been reached. Accomplishing the 2-degree scenario
may be difficult. The world's track record in emissions reductions is
poor. According to [Friedlingstein, et
al.](http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/global/pdf/Friedlingstein_2014_Persistent%20growth%20of%20CO2%20emissions%20and%20implications%20for%20reaching%20climate%20targets.NatureG.pdf),
"Current emission growth rates are twice as large as in the 1990s
despite 20 years of international climate negotiations under the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)." There has been
a [reported flattening in fossil fuel
emissions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/11/13/stunningly-good-news-for-the-planet-carbon-emissions-were-flat-for-the-third-straight-year/)
for the past couple of years, due primarily to reported coal reductions
in China. It remains to be seen whether this is the beginning of a
reversal. Even so, emissions would have to decrease rapidly to meet even
the 2-degree goal. **[Prescriptions for reversal]{.underline}** of
global warming **[include]{.underline}** proposed [geoengineering
methods](http://www.geoengineering.ox.ac.uk/what-is-geoengineering/what-is-geoengineering/)
for [**[removing CO2 from the
atmosphere]{.underline}**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/02/26/weve-reached-the-point-where-we-need-these-bizarre-technologies-to-stop-climate-change/)
and cooling the Earth by [reflecting or blocking solar
radiation](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032113008460).
[These do not mean]{.underline} that [a tipping point was not
passed]{.underline}. In the analogy shown in the cartoon above, one can
push the rock back up the hill even after it has rolled to the bottom.
Have we passed the tipping point? Observed advances in multiple tipping
mechanisms certainly raise the question whether the tipping point has
been passed. However, these mechanisms are accounted for to at least
some degree in climate models, so interpreting that we have passed the
tipping point requires that the models understate warming effects. This
is essentially an issue of the sensitivity of climate, that is, how much
warming results from a given greenhouse gas concentration. The
[IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full.pdf)'s
analysis concludes the likely range of equilibrium sensitivity for
doubling of CO2 is 1.5 degrees to 4.5 degrees. As the graph below shows,
there is reasonable probability that it could be substantially higher.
If the actual value of sensitivity falls in these higher ranges, warming
will be greater than predicted by the IPCC models and a tipping point or
points may have been exceeded. I'm not sure that anyone actually knows
the answer, which leaves me with the unsatisfactory conclusion of not
having answered the question I have raised. [Regardless of]{.underline}
whether we have passed [the tipping point]{.underline}, continued
**[warming, rainfall]{.underline}** pattern **[changes]{.underline}**,
significant **[sea level rise and]{.underline}** continued northward and
vertical **[migration of]{.underline}** plant and animal
**[species]{.underline}** in the Northern Hemisphere **[seem
certain]{.underline}**. We are looking at a changed world and must adapt
to it. Not an excuse for inaction [One should not view]{.underline} the
possibility that we have passed [a significant tipping point as a reason
for inaction]{.underline}. Although I remain somewhat skeptical of the
degree of human contribution to climate change, it is prudent to take
reasonable actions that may reduce the problem. In addition, **[there
are multiple possible tipping points with different
thresholds]{.underline}**. [Exceeding one does not mean you cannot avoid
another.]{.underline}

CCS creates jobs on site for fossil fuel workers facing redundancy

[Carbon capture]{.underline} will enable a just transition for workers
currently employed in the energy sector. It [will **build new low-carbon
industries**, **repurpose** existing infrastructure and **keeping
industries competitive** in a low-carbon future.]{.underline}

[CCS will **help renewables thrive**. Clean, dispatchable, **back-up
power**]{.underline} -- for example [provided by **natural gas plants**
with **CCS**]{.underline} -- [will be able to balance the **intermittent
nature of wind** and **solar generation**]{.underline} [while keeping
**costs** down.]{.underline} In fact, [researchers have found that CCS
can **reduce overall system costs** and **capacity
requirements**]{.underline}. In the US, innovators are already working
on a next-generation natural gas power plant which is meant to provide
reliable and flexible carbon-free power at cost-parity with conventional
combined cycle gas power plants.

#### The [IPCC agrees]{.underline} --- sequestration [outweighs]{.underline} and [obviates]{.underline} the influence of renewables.

As global emissions continue to rise **[we are likely to overshoot our
climate goals]{.underline}**, and therefore [carbon dioxide will need to
be **permanently removed** from the atmosphere and used or
stored]{.underline}. In fact, [**all four scenarios** outlined in the
IPCC]{.underline} SR15 report [rely on **carbon removal**, with three of
the four scenarios foreseeing **significant amounts** of **carbon
capture and storage.**]{.underline}

CCS can also have a role to play in generating power, as most emissions
linked to energy infrastructure are already essentially locked-in.
Coal-fired power plants, which account for one-third of energy-related
CO2 emissions today, represent more than a third of cumulative locked-in
emissions to 2040. Most of these plants are in Asia, where average coal
plant is just 11 years old with decades left to operate. Looking ahead,
more than 200 GW of coal capacity is under construction globally with
300 new plants to come online in the next few years in India and China
alone. CCS is the only technology that can truly decarbonise these
facilities.

In OECD countries, renewable intermittency poses a real challenge to
grid operators. [Zero-emission electricity is **central to our future**
but **balancing** **services** are likely to **continue to be
dominated** by **gas-fired plants** for]{.underline} several
**[decades]{.underline}** yet. **[CCS is necessary.]{.underline}**

[**High cost** is often touted as the reason behind CCS' failure to
scale]{.underline} up. Based on 'micro' measurements such as the
levelised cost of electricity, [power generation that incorporates CCS
may **appear** more expensive]{.underline} compared to other sources.
**[However]{.underline}**, [modelling by climate organizations such as
the **IPCC**]{.underline} and the UK Committee on Climate Change
[**repeatedly demonstrates** that at a **'macro' system
level**]{.underline} - which surely should matter more from a societal
point of view - [achieving **deep decarbonisation** would
be]{.underline} extremely difficult and costly, if not outright
[**impossible**, **without CCS.**]{.underline}

At a micro level, while [the cost of CCS]{.underline} could be more than
\$100 per tonne of CO2, it [can also be as low as \$**20 a
tonne**]{.underline} for those applications where CO2 removal is an
inherent part of the production process, such as in natural gas
processing. Within that range, the IEA finds that as much as 450 million
tonnes of CO2 can be captured and stored with a commercial incentive as
low as \$40 per tonne of CO2. Harnessing these low-cost opportunities
could provide a solid foundation for scaling up CCS deployment.

Technology innovation will also help. In the US, an emissions-free
natural gas power plant began test operations in 2018, which has carbon
capture built in as part of the combustion cycle aiming to compete with
conventional combined cycle generation. If proven in practice, this
could be a game-changer.

#### Spills over to [total]{.underline} decarbonization --- [hydrogen recycling]{.underline}.

In the long run, [CCS can become the **foundation** of a new **clean**
and **sustainable energy economy**]{.underline}. [The production of
**low-cost hydrogen** with **CCS** opens a **plethora of opportunities
for**]{.underline} this energy vector in industry, heat, transportation
and **[energy production.]{.underline}** In the UK, for instance, the
CCS-equipped HyNet North West facility is expected to produce hydrogen
for industrial sites, home heating and as transportation fuel. The
project could potentially serve more than 2 million homes and
businesses. And [the H21 North of England project aims to
**convert**]{.underline} part of [the]{.underline} northern UK [gas grid
to **hydrogen** decarbonized with **CCS**.]{.underline}

As [the world]{.underline} continues to emit more CO2, it [is likely to
**overshoot its climate goals**]{.underline}. **[Direct air
capture]{.underline}** (DAC) **[technologies]{.underline}**, albeit
nascent, [will be able to **suck CO2 out of the air**]{.underline}. [The
deployment of CCS provides **learning opportunities** and
**infrastructure** for these **early technologies**]{.underline}.

[Currently, CCS deployment is **off-track.**]{.underline} There are 43
large-scale CCS facilities -- 18 in commercial operation, five under
construction and 20 in various stages of development around the world.
Projections estimate that by 2040, we will need more than 2,000. [While
abundant storage is **mapped** and available to trap **hundreds of years
of emissions**, there is still a **long way to go** in terms of
**policy**]{.underline} and deployment.

Growth: **[Decarbonisation]{.underline}** can be a driver for prosperity

But [what sounds daunting might well be an **unprecedented opportunity
for economic growth.**]{.underline} Former heads of governments and
climate leaders agree: [Decarbonisation is also the **growth story** of
the 21st century]{.underline}. The New Climate Economy found that [bold
climate action can deliver **\$26 trillion in economic
benefits**]{.underline} through 2030 (compared with business-as-usual),
[while generating more than 65 **million jobs** and avoiding more than
700,000]{.underline} premature [deaths]{.underline} from air pollution
in 2030.

These findings should not go unnoticed, and [governments should be
**looking for ways** to capture this potential and **translate it** into
**actual economic growth**.]{.underline}

Technology neutrality: Let's not discard any solutions

We need ambition - but we also need cool heads. If we continue to
perceive this challenge along the lines that have divided us for so long
--- as a tug-of-war, in effect --- we will lose as a collective.

[One of the key technologies]{.underline} that [is]{.underline}
off-track in the IEA's clean energy monitor is carbon capture and
storage (**[CCS]{.underline}**), [a set of technologies that **prevents
carbon dioxide emissions** from **entering the atmosphere** and **safely
stores them deep underground**]{.underline} in dedicated geological
storage.

CCS first started to gain recognition in the 2000s as a means of
capturing emissions from the dirtiest source of energy: coal-fired
generation. This perception, that CCS is about delivering 'clean coal',
coupled with the fact that its deployment globally has been slower than
predicted has hung an albatross around its neck.

The truth is that [CCS has **much wider** **applications**. It remains
the **only technology** that can deliver deep emissions reductions in
hard-to-abate industrial sectors such as **steel, fertiliser and
cement**.]{.underline} [Decarbonising these sectors is **not simply
about electrifying** them with **zero-carbon power**; most of these
processes require either carbon in their **chemistry** or **high heat
input,**]{.underline} [neither of which electricity is **able to
provide**.]{.underline}

#### CCS does *[not]{.underline}* cause earthquakes---there's [zero data]{.underline}, [water]{.underline} and [pipelines]{.underline} solve, and it's [empirically disproven]{.underline}

  least **20 billion tons more CO2** for EOR projects, roughly **10
  times** the output of the U.S. coal fleet.]{.underline}

- Even beneath the U.S. Midwest, where many of the region's coal-fired
  power plants will look to store their carbon emissions, Dr. Zoback
  acknowledges that [some of the region's emissions can be safely stored
  in the Mt. Simon formation in the Illinois basin, where there are also
  several other target formations with multiple overlying seals that he
  **does not even consider**]{.underline}. And, if [a maximum storage
  level is ever attained there, CO2 could be **pipelined to other
  storage sites**]{.underline} [where there is **minimal seismic
  risk**.]{.underline} A pipeline to southern Illinois is already in the
  planning stages that will bring CO2 from the Midwest to EOR projects
  in LA, TX and MS.

- **[Offshore]{.underline}**, within the continental shelf, where Dr.
  Zoback acknowledges that formations would not be prone to seismicity,
  [there is an **enormous capacity** on all three U.S. coastlines for
  carbon sequestration]{.underline}, with estimates ranging from 500
  billion tons to 7.5 trillion tons, according to NETL.

- [To **reduce pressure** in some storage formations, **brine water
  removal** combined with saline storage can **ease** and
  **redistribute** pressures to **further reduce seismic
  risk.**]{.underline}

- [According to researchers at **MIT**]{.underline} who have studied the
  CO2 storage capacity in the U.S., [there's just **not enough data** to
  construct any models that can **currently predict
  earthquakes**]{.underline} induced from carbon dioxide injections.

- [Carbon dioxide injection projects around the world have **yet to
  report** any **significant induced seismicity**]{.underline}
  (including the 1 billion tons injected for EOR).

So while Dr. Zoback is raising the awareness of the importance of
selecting safe sequestration sites, [we strongly disagree with his
**pessimistic conclusion**]{.underline} [about the global future of
carbon capture]{.underline} and storage. His opinion paper draws that
conclusion by analogy and computer modeling, but [it\'s **highly
premature** to condemn CCS without **more experience**]{.underline};
[more investment and research is needed, not **less**]{.underline}.
There's no question that seismic factors must be considered in the
planning and permitting process for selecting carbon storage sites, and
that [**EPA** and **state regulators** should **pay** **attention** to
induced seismicity]{.underline}. But fundamentally, we maintain that the
expense of overcoming any such obstacles will be minimal compared to the
global costs of climate change from unmitigated industrial greenhouse
gas emissions into our atmosphere.

#### Taps into [strong bipartisan support]{.underline}.

[A **bipartisan group** of senators is pushing for funding at the
\"**highest possible levels**\" for **carbon capture technology
development.**]{.underline}

The 12 [lawmakers]{.underline}, including four Republicans, [urged
Senate appropriators to provide the D]{.underline}epartment
[o]{.underline}f [E]{.underline}nergy [with **maximum funding**
for]{.underline} carbon capture, utilization and storage
(**[CCUS]{.underline}**).

"As the world transitions towards a carbon constrained economy,
[investment in **CCUS technology** will **spur economic development**
and **ensure energy security** while **protecting the environment** from
carbon dioxide emissions]{.underline} and maintaining global leadership
role in research and development," the lawmakers wrote Thursday in
letter to the top senators on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy
and Water Development.

The letter was signed by Sens. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Michael Bennet
(D-Colo.), Christopher Coons (D-Del.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Steve
Daines (R-Mont.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), Tim
Kaine (D-Va.), Angus King (I-Maine), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Jon Tester
(D-Mont.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.).

They argued that [investment in creating **viable options**]{.underline}
[to capture carbon emissions released into the atmosphere could **spur
U.S. job growth**.]{.underline}

"According to the International Energy Agency and the United Nations
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), [CCUS is a **critical
component** of the portfolio of energy technologies]{.underline} needed
to reduce carbon dioxide emissions worldwide," the senators wrote. "As
the U.S. develops CCUS technologies, we will benefit not only from
cleaner power here at home, but from new markets for U.S. technologies
abroad, including innovations towards direct air capture."

in the state. Figure 28.1 identifies rates of growth in key activities
that define the material conditions in which people live. I use a
100-year view to calculate the rate of improvement, which is consistent
with efforts to analyze distributive justice. [Lighting, heating, power
and transportation are **energy-intensive activities** that receive a
great deal of attention]{.underline} in the discussion of energy poverty
and justice. [Light, heat and power are **central to defining the
standard of living**]{.underline} and, hence, the energy justice
analysis. [The **direct link between energy consumption and income** is
also central to that discussion.]{.underline} [Starting with the
emergence of capitalism and accelerating in the industrial era, these
four services exhibited a **dramatic decline in cost**,]{.underline}
which made them affordable for an ever increasing number of people. I
include three measures of the overall outcome of the economic
development process---population growth, output per capita and energy
consumption per capita. North ( 2005 , p. 89) points to population for
an obvious reason: [Statistical data]{.underline} \... can get us part
way in describing the magnitude of changes in the landscape. They
[provide dramatic evidence of the **revolutionary changes** in the human
condition]{.underline}. Man's subjugation of the uncertainties related
to the physical environment is most clearly manifested in the explosive
increases in population since the beginning of the modern age in the
eighteenth century \.... [\[T\]his dramatic change along with major
development in knowledge, technological progress, and scientific
breakthroughs that contributed to this explosive
development]{.underline}. [The close correlation between GDP per capita
and population is clear]{.underline}. [GDP per capita and its growth
have been the primary focal point of the analysis of economic growth and
development for quite some time]{.underline}. The close correlation
between GDP per capita and energy consumption per capita has also been a
focal point of analysis. 12 [The graph also identifies several
technologies that are widely seen as ushering in fundamental
shifts]{.underline} in economic activity. An important and obvious point
to be made is that [these involve power and transportation
technologies]{.underline}. Three of the recent examples involve
energy---steam, internal combustion engine and electricity.
[Substituting mechanical power for human and animal power constitutes a
major leap]{.underline}. The shift to electricity, considered a General
Purpose Technology (Jovanovic and Rousseau 2005 ), 13 was one of the key
factors in the second industrial revolution. Finally, at the bottom, the
graph shows [key developments in the structure of policy
making]{.underline}. [The **nation-state was a key development** that
enabled the process of economic growth to gain traction]{.underline}
(Acemoglu and Robinson 2012 , Figure 5). [The Westphalian state was a
key development. Efforts to organize relations between states were the
subject of a stream of treaties, but the graph shows the major eff orts
to organize multilateral relations in the twentieth
century.]{.underline} It is important to keep in mind that the graph is
truncated. [Prior to the year 1400, the rate of growth in the factors
that affect material well-being was **virtually nil**]{.underline}. [The
data underscore the **immense progress** made in the material condition
of society in the past three centuries.]{.underline} [The dramatic
change in the rates of progress is **coincident with the emergence of
capitalism** and]{.underline}, in particular, the industrial revolution.
[The key message for the purpose of this analysis is **strikingly
clear**]{.underline}. If we accept the proposition that human
civilization dates back about 12 millennia, then the capitalist era is
about 4% of human history. [The industrial era covers the second half of
that period. Measured by population, per capita income, heat, power,
transportation, lighting, about 90 % of human progress has taken place
in the most recent 2 % of human history, the very short period of
capitalist industrialization]{.underline}. 14 The Virtuous Cycle of
Progress and the Potential for Justice The progressive capitalist frame
for a theory of justice launches from this dramatic change in the human
condition. Obviously, it postdates much of the thinking of the ancient
philosophers and early modern (preindustrial) political theorists who
naturally make up a large part of the intellectual and cultural heritage
of the Western concept of justice, as discussed at length the Global
Energy Justice . [There has been a dramatic transformation of the
terrain of justice in three ways.]{.underline} • [The capitalist
industrial revolution has not only produced a **dramatic improvement in
the human condition**, it has also created the
possibility/hope/expectation that there will be a massive and continuing
improvement]{.underline} in the material well-being of people. Mankind
has been freed from endless poverty and expects continuous economic
growth and improvement in material conditions. • [The improvement in
material well-being comes with]{.underline} (and is in part dependent
on) [an increasing **interdependence of economic activity**]{.underline}
(a refined division of labor and globalization). • [Increasing wealth
and improvements in communications]{.underline} (which are made possible
by changes in energy technology, i.e. electrification) [have allowed
more and more people to engage and participate more directly and
force-fully in self-governance.]{.underline} In the capitalist
industrial era [we no longer have to treat human history as a kind of
zero-sum, depleting resource story]{.underline}. [The current generation
should not be chastised for overconsuming scarce resources as long as it
produces the means to maintain and improve the prospects of future
generations]{.underline}. For the past quarter of a millennium, [the
groundwork for a much higher standard of living has been **laid by each
successive generation**.]{.underline} Perez ( 2002 ) argues that
capitalist development needs to be progressive in the sense I use the
term. **[Technology is the fuel of the capitalist engine]{.underline}**
(Perez 2002 , p. 155). The potential for production and productivity
growth is considerable. [What is needed for its realization is a new
space for the unhindered expansion of markets]{.underline}, [favoring
economics of scale and fostering a new wave of investment]{.underline}.
[This essentially means that adequate regulation]{.underline} \...
**[has to be established and an institutional framework]{.underline}**
[favoring the real economy over the paper economy needs to be put in
plac]{.underline}e \... So the rhythm of potential growth is modulated
by the qualitative dynamics of effective demand (Perez 2002 , pp.
114--116). [Since market saturation is one of the main limits
encountered in deploying the growth potential of a technology
revolution]{.underline}, [ensuring consistent extension of markets is
the way to facilitate the pursuit of those goals]{.underline}.
Consequently, it is progressive distribution and worldwide advances in
development that can best guarantee a continued expansion of demand
(Perez 2002 , p. 124). [The impact of progressive capitalism on the
terrain of justice involves more than simple progress]{.underline}. It
also reflects the structure and process by which capitalism creates
progress. [Two key processes are involved. A discussion of these broad
issues is beyond the scope of this chapter and has been offered
elsewhere]{.underline} (Cooper 2015 ). Here I emphasize two points that
are central to the discussion of energy justice. • [First, the
explanation asserts that capitalism has given birth to **recursive
feedback loops**, virtuous circles and cycles, of creative destruction
and construction that creates a spiral of progress.]{.underline} •
Second, [the **division of labor advances relentlessly**, which
ultimately increases human capital and promotes democratic
equality.]{.underline} The stark contrast between the
twenty-first-century digital mode of production that is emerging and the
twentieth-century mode of production described by Perez ( 2004 , 2009 )
underscores this process in several ways. First, the mass market
production of the twentieth century was very much driven by fossil fuel
consumption. The digital mode of production is much more dependent on
electricity. Second, [technologies are emerging to power more and more
activity with electricity.]{.underline} Third, [the heterogeneity of
products creates niche markets. Fourth, the new division of labor is
much more global and complex, shifting a great deal of activity and
autonomy to the edge of the networks. The virtuous cycles of economic
progress are **interconnected** in the sense that they tend to **produce
the key ingredients** to solve the next great challenge that faces the
economic syste]{.underline}m. Perez builds this into her model of
capital-ism by linking Schumpeter's concept of creative destruction to
the equally powerful process of creative construction. [The result is a
spiral of development. While analysis of this process is also beyond the
scope of this chapter, one aspect of the current phase of development is
critical to the discussion of energy justice. Industrial revolutions
produce the **ingredients necessary to solve the challenges that they
faced.** This is certainly true of the third industrial revolution **in
the energy sector**]{.underline}, the electricity sector in particular.
[Dynamic technological development has produced the tools for the
**transformation of the energy sector that can solve the problem of
climate change**]{.underline}, [while dealing with the challenge of
energy jus-tice.]{.underline} [The central station model of base-load
facilities combined with high cost peaking power and massive amounts of
pollution, including greenhouse gas emissions, has been **undercut by
dramatically declining cost for distributed renewables and
storage**]{.underline}. [The Information and Communications Technologies
revolution has now made it possible to **integrate and manage demand and
supply** rather than build central station, fossil-fuel-based powered
facilities that passively follow load]{.underline}. [Economic analyses
of the cost of addressing energy justice that were offered as it became
a topic of increasing attention a decade ago are obsolete as a result of
**dramatic innovation and competition**]{.underline} (Cooper 2014b ). An
electricity sector centered on smaller scale, [more flexible resources
should facilitate and lower the cost of addressing both energy poverty
and cli-mate change]{.underline}. [This technological revolution not
only delivers affordable electricity, but it also does so in a manner
that **utilizes local resources and fosters local autonomy.** As has
always been the case]{.underline}, however, [there is a struggle between
the incumbent and the new entrant technologies over the speed and
ultimate configuration of the new system and which values will be
expressed by the system]{.underline}. In short, [the energy sector, in
general, and the electricity sector, in particular, are at the
**"turning point"**]{.underline} (Perez 2002 ) or "critical juncture"
(Robinson and Acemoglu 2012 ) of the "quarter-life crisis of the digital
mode of production" (Cooper 2013b ). [Political economy is about
**driving the economy in the right direction with policy**]{.underline}.
While the outcome is uncertain, the technological progress suggests that
prospects are good for a successful deployment of the third industrial
revolution.

#### There are no [limits to growth]{.underline}. Environmental impacts are declining and growth drives critical [technological progress]{.underline} that improves environmental outcomes.

Humanity has flourished over the past two centuries. **[Average life
expectancy has increased]{.underline}** from 30 to 70 years, [resulting
in a large and growing population able to live in many different
environments]{.underline}. [Humanity has made extraordinary progress in
reducing]{.underline} the incidence and impacts of infectious
**[diseases]{.underline}**, [and it has become more resilient to extreme
weather and other natural disasters **Violence in all forms has declined
significantly**]{.underline} [and is]{.underline} probably [at the
lowest per capita level ever experienced by the human
species]{.underline}, the horrors of the 20th century and present-day
terrorism notwithstanding. Globally, [human beings have moved from
autocratic government toward liberal democracy characterized by the rule
of law and increased freedom]{.underline}. Personal, economic, and
political liberties have spread worldwide and are today largely accepted
as universal values. Modernization liberates women from traditional
gender roles, increasing their control of their fertility. [Historically
large numbers of humans]{.underline} --- both in percentage and in
absolute terms --- [are free from insecurity, penury, and
servitude]{.underline}. At the same time, [human flourishing has taken a
serious toll on natural, nonhuman environments and
wildlife]{.underline}. Humans use about half of the planet's ice-free
land, mostly for pasture, crops, and production forestry. Of the land
once covered by forests, 20 percent has been converted to human use.
Populations of many mammals, amphibians, and birds have declined by more
than 50 percent in the past 40 years alone. More than 100 species from
those groups went extinct in the 20th century, and about 785 since 1500.
As we write, only four northern white rhinos are confirmed to exist.
Given that humans are completely dependent on the living biosphere, how
is it possible that people are doing so much damage to natural systems
without doing more harm to themselves? [The role that **technology plays
in reducing humanity's dependence on nature**]{.underline} [explains
this paradox]{.underline}. [Human technologies, from those that first
enabled agriculture to replace hunting and gathering, to those that
drive today's globalized economy, have made humans less reliant upon the
many ecosystems that once provided their only sustenance]{.underline},
even as those same ecosystems have often been left deeply damaged.
[Despite frequent assertions]{.underline} starting in the 1970s [of
fundamental "limits to growth," there is still remarkably **little
evidence**]{.underline} [that human population and **economic
expansion** will outstrip the capacity to grow food or procure critical
material resources]{.underline} in the foreseeable future. Even as human
environmental impacts continue to grow in the aggregate, [a range of
long-term trends are today driving significant **decoupling** of human
well-being from environmental impacts.]{.underline} Decoupling occurs in
both relative and absolute terms. Relative decoupling means that human
environmental impacts rise at a slower rate than overall economic
growth. us, for each unit of economic output, less environmental impact
(e.g., deforestation, defaunation, pollution) results. Overall impacts
may still increase, just at a slower rate than would otherwise be the
case. Absolute decoupling occurs when total environmental impacts ---
impacts in the aggregate --- peak and begin to decline, even as the
economy continues to grow. [Decoupling can be driven by both
technological and demographic trends and usually results from a
combination of the two]{.underline}. [The growth rate of the human
population has already peaked]{.underline}. Today's population growth
rate is one percent per year, down from its high point of 2.1 percent in
the 1970s. [Fertility rates in countries containing more than half of
the global population are now below replacement level]{.underline}.
[Population growth today is primarily driven by **longer life spans and
lower infant mortality**, not by rising fertility rates]{.underline}.
Given current trends, it is very possible that [the size of the human
population will peak this century and then start to
decline]{.underline}. [Trends in population are inextricably linked to
other demographic and economic dynamics]{.underline}. For the first time
in human history, over half the global population lives in cities. [By
2050, 70 percent are expected to dwell in cities, a number that could
rise to 80 percent or more by the century's end]{.underline}. Cities are
characterized by both dense populations and low fertility rates. Cities
occupy just one to three percent of the Earth's surface and yet are home
to nearly four billion people. As such, [cities both drive and symbolize
the decoupling of humanity from nature, performing far better than rural
economies in providing efficiently for material needs while **reducing
environmental impacts**.]{.underline} The growth of cities along with
the economic and ecological benefits that come with them are inseparable
from improvements in agricultural productivity. As agriculture has
become more land and labor efficient, rural populations have left the
countryside for the cities. Roughly half the US population worked the
land in 1880. Today, less than 2 percent does. [As human lives have been
liberated from hard **agricultural labor**, enormous human resources
have been freed up for other endeavors]{.underline}. Cities, as people
know them today, could not exist without radical changes in farming. [In
contrast, modernization is not possible in a subsistence agrarian
economy.]{.underline} These improvements have resulted not only in lower
labor requirements per unit of agricultural output but also in lower
land requirements. This is not a new trend: rising harvest yields have
for millennia reduced the amount of land required to feed the average
person. [The average per-capita use of land today is vastly lower than
it was 5,000 years ago, despite the fact that modern people enjoy a far
richer diet]{.underline}. [**Thanks to technological improvements** in
agriculture]{.underline}, during the half-century starting in the
mid-1960s, [the amount of land required for growing crops and animal
feed for the average person declined by one-half. Agricultural
intensification]{.underline}, along with the move away from the use of
wood as fuel, [has allowed many parts of the world to experience **net
reforestation**]{.underline}. About 80 percent of New England is today
forested, compared with about 50 percent at the end of the 19th century.
Over the past 20 years, the amount of land dedicated to production
forest worldwide declined by 50 million hectares, an area the size of
France. [The "forest transition" from net deforestation to net
reforestation seems to be as resilient a feature of development as the
demographic transition that reduces human birth rates as poverty
declines]{.underline}. [Human use of many other resources is similarly
peaking]{.underline}. [The amount of water needed for the average diet
has **declined by nearly 25 percent** over the past
half-century]{.underline}. Nitrogen pollution continues to cause
eutrophication and large dead zones in places like the Gulf of Mexico.
[While the total amount of nitrogen pollution is rising, the amount used
per unit of production has **declined significantly in developed
nations**]{.underline}. Indeed, [in contradiction to the often-expressed
fear of infinite growth colliding with a finite planet, demand for many
material goods may be saturating as societies grow
wealthier]{.underline}. [Meat consumption]{.underline}, for instance,
[has peaked in many wealthy nations and has shifted away from beef
toward protein sources that are less land intensive]{.underline}. As
demand for material goods is met, [developed economies see higher levels
of spending directed to materially less-intensive service and knowledge
sectors, which account for an increasing share of economic
activity]{.underline}. This dynamic might be even more pronounced in
today's developing economies, which may benefit from being late adopters
of resource-efficient technologies. [Taken together, these trends mean
that the total human impact on the environment, including land-use
change, overexploitation, and pollution,]{.underline} **[can peak and
decline this century]{.underline}**. By understanding and promoting
these emergent processes, [humans have the opportunity to re-wild and
re-green the Earth --- even as developing countries achieve modern
living standards, and material poverty ends]{.underline}.

#### No collapse\-\--the economy is sustainable and no trade shift

Michael **LYNCH 16**. Director, Asian Energy and Security, Center for
International Studies at MIT; Lecturer, Tufts and Vienna University;
President of Strategic Energy and Economic Consulting. *The "Peak Oil"
Scare and the Coming Oil Flood*. Praeger. 57-74.

The results, published in the 1970 book [The Limits to Growth, used
estimate of resources, combined with population and economic growth, to
find when exhaustion would occur, as well as estimating pollution
levels]{.underline}.10 [Their conclusion that existing trends were
unsustainable was]{.underline}, again, [seized on]{.underline} by many
[to promote]{.underline} [deindustrialization, zero economic
growth,]{.underline} \[END OF PAGE 58\] [and]{.underline} a number of
[similar ideologies]{.underline}. It certainly helped to influence the
Carter administration\'s views on resources, as Chapter 2 demonstrated.

AN ENORMOUS BUT

[Unfortunately, this entire area is **based on mistaken
principles**]{.underline}. [The Limits to Growth made the very basic
mistake of assuming no change in growth rates, when in fact, the
post-World War II economic trends were elevated by recovery from
war-time damage]{.underline}, just as Chinese and Indian growth rates
are now elevated by the movement of the workforce from agriculture to
industry and services. [Already, global population growth rates have
dropped sharply, and a peak is in sight]{.underline} (although
demographic trends do change!), [and, more important for commodities,
they ignore the mechanism by which growth rates change: scarcity yields
higher prices, which **reduces consumption**; causes **switching to
substitutes**; and leads to **new supplies being
developed**]{.underline}. [The early models **assumed no feedback
effects**]{.underline}.

[That mistake is **compounded** by the use of resource estimates that
are much **too conservative**]{.underline}. The Limits to Growth team
attempted to avoid this problem by using estimates that were multiples
of then-official numbers; however, they didn\'t realize that [the data
they were relying on were not actual estimates of global resources, but
known developed reserves, a small subset of the resource
base]{.underline} (see Chapter 15).

[Petroleum is the clearest example]{.underline} of how these numbers
were far too conservative. The authors thought that they would avoid
such criticism by testing the results of a resource base that was five
times more than known reserves of 455 billion barrels, or 2,275 billion
barrels. I I Since then, the world has used 1,100 billion barrels of oil
and still has about 1,700 billion barrels of reserves. [Even excluding
heavy oil and the so-called spurious reserve revisions, the assumption
in The Limits to Growth would mean no more oil remained to be
discovered]{.underline}.

MY FAIR MALTHUSIAN

\"Just you wait, \'Enry \'iggins!\" Eliza Doolittle, \"My Fair Lady\"

The amazing thing is that, like the Millenarians, [the Malthusians
**never seem to be concerned** when their **predictions
fail**]{.underline}. Indeed, [many]{.underline} of them [look back and
find that their expectations were (somehow) confirmed]{.underline}. The
Limits to Growth authors are quite enthusiastic about the fact that
\[END OF PAGE 59\] growing mineral reserves (and production) had
confirmed their warnings, since it implied that we are \"closer to the
end.\"

[There seem to be three approaches to dealing with the problem of model
and/or theoretical failure: claim you missed on the timing, ignore much
of what you said earlier, or insist you were right all
along]{.underline}. [All have been used by]{.underline} various
[neo-Malthusians]{.underline}, including the peak oil advocates.

Gardner discusses a number of neo-Malthusian analysts who proved not
just wrong but woefully so, and yet none admits to it. This includes not
only Ehrlich but also Heilbroner and Kunstler, the latter now a peak oil
advocate. Gardner explains that \"the first line of defense of the
failed prophet is \... the clock is still ticking.\" 12

Two [recent appraisals of the original Limits To Growth]{.underline}
work [carry this even further]{.underline}. Validating the model\'s
forecasts, both [**Turner** and **Alexander** and **Hall** and **Day**
argue that they were quite accurate]{.underline}. 13 In reality, the
model\'s forecast of continued growth was the accurate element, since
the impending collapse remains in the future. Thus, the socioeconomic
trends of the past four decades in no way confirm the model and
especially its principal warning that resource scarcity would have a
major impact in the 21st century.

[This is reminiscent of the London astrologers]{.underline}, described
by Charles MacKay, [who predicted that River Thames would
catastrophically flood London on February 1, 1524]{.underline}. [When it
failed to do so, and the citizenry considered dunking said
astrologers]{.underline} in the river, [they explained that \"By an
error]{.underline} (a very slight one) [of a little figure, they had
fixed the date]{.underline} of this awful inundation [a whole century
too early]{.underline}. [The stars were right after all, and they,
erring mortals, were wrong]{.underline}.\" 14 In other words, the model
was correct; a bad piece of data was to blame.

[Peak oil advocates emulate this approach]{.underline}, with Campbell
stiffly quoting Keynes, \"When I have new information, I change my
conclusions. What do you do? Sir.\"15 Of course, he ignores the fact
that his most important claim was to have robust data that were not
revised (see Chapter 7). He also doesn\'t mention his many earlier
predictions of a peak in production, rather showing the \"depletion
midpoint,\" which he says changed only by five years over a decade.

Robert Hirsch lists predictions of peak oil, but only the most recent
ones at the time of the report, ignoring that a number of other dates
have already passed. Few discuss forecasts for individual countries, and
there appears to be no recognition that Simmons\'s warning of the
impending collapse of Saudi oil production failed abysmally ( see
Chapter 8). \[END OF PAGE 60\]

[The same thing occurs with neo-Malthusians]{.underline}, the classic
example being The Limits to Growth work, which continues to be updated
and, to the uninitiated, appears sound, while those sympathetic to its
views continue to trumpet its quality. Simmons, for example, said, \"The
most amazing aspect of the book is how accurate many of the basic trend
extrapolation worries \... still are, some 30 years later, \... there
was nothing that I could find in the book which has so far been even
vaguely invalidated.\" 16

He goes beyond this to say, \"There was not one sentence or even a
single word written about an oil shortage, or limit to any specific
resource, by the year 2000.\" 17 Why he thinks the year 2000 was
referenced is not clear, but [the authors]{.underline} clearly did
[describe one scenario as finding, \"Eventual depletion of nonrenewables
brings a sudden collapse of the industry system.\"]{.underline}18

[The authors themselves, in the first update, note that energy reserves
have been rising, even relative to consumption]{.underline}. [Does this
mean their model was wrong? They change this question into, does this
mean that there was more fuel in 1990 than in 1970?]{.underline} \"No,
of course not. There were 450 fewer billion barrels of oil, 90 billion
fewer tons of coal, and 1100 trillion few cubic meters of natural gas.\"
19

[Changing the subject is also popular]{.underline}. Thus, Simmons rebuts
criticism of The Limits to Growth by noting that population and economic
growth have, in fact, continued, and use of resources has soared. 20
Similarly, [Patterson argues that Ehrlich was right because the
population has grown as he had predicted]{.underline}. 21 [Of course,
these were not the points at issue, something that goes
unmentioned]{.underline}.

FINITE RESOURCES: THINK INSIDE THE BOX

One of the major tenets of peak oilers is the fact that oil resources
are finite, and therefore we are running out, and thus they must peak.
(Implied is that we might not foresee the peak and that it will somehow
be catastrophic.) Repeatedly, I have had hostile questioners ask me to
admit that oil is finite. \[END OF PAGE 61\]

This is so prevalent that it often becomes a straw man for peak oil
advocates, who accuse \"optimists\" like me of believing in \"infinite
resources.\" Campbell goes so far as to tum a comment by M. A. Adelman
and me that resources are so large as to be effectively infinite into
actually infinite. 23 And others such as Bartlett have used the term
flat-earth economist to refer to someone who doesn\'t seem to recognize
that the Earth is a sphere, and, as such, any given resource is finite.
This is a simplistic error, which we shall return to later. 24

Indeed, one reason that many support renewables it that they are
\"sustainable.\" The wind doesn\'t run out and crops are reborn every
year. Our great-great-great grandchildren could still be getting wind
from nearby mountain passes or offshore sites, and (ignoring climate
change and soil erosion and degradation) without fearing that the
resource will deplete, while the oil industry must constantly struggle
to replace wells and fields whose resource has been exhausted.

Problem 1

The first problem is that the finite nature of oil is not strictly
speaking true. Unlike mineral resources, petroleum resources are created
in an ongoing manner from biomass. Admittedly, it takes millions of
years and the right combination of heat and pressure to turn organic
(mostly plant and algae) material into coal, oil, and gas. (And actually
mineral resources are born in supernovae explosions, but replenishment
of Earth\'s minerals from a supernova anytime soon seems pretty
unlikely.) The length of time is not really important, though, since the
process started many millions of years ago; what matters is the rate and
accumulated amount.

And there, as Hamlet would say, is the rub. Only about 2 million barrels
of petroleum are created in a year, according to best estimates, which
represents approximately 0.0064% of what we are currently consuming. In
other words, the fact that oil is actually renewable is not important
because the rate is too small to matter, which brings us to the point
that the (allegedly) finite nature of petroleum is not important either,
because only the numbers matter. Pointing to oil\'s finite nature is
valuable only as evidence of either one\'s ignorance of resources or
poor math skills.

Greek Fire

Optimists often remark that \"The Stone Age didn\'t end because we ran
out of stones,\" but more relevantly, neither did the Bronze or Iron
Ages \[END OF PAGE 62\] end because those more rare and scarce
nonrenewable resources were depleted. Indeed, it was prior to the Golden
Age of Greece when the primary soldiers were hoplites, that is, landed
gentry who had enough wealth to afford the bronze armor that they wore.

Now, roughly five millennia after the Bronze Age began, copper is no
longer the province of the wealthy but the stuff of pennies! Granted,
copper pipes are valuable enough to attract the attention of the
avaricious (thieves, not Congress), but it remains readily available,
and every boom in prices has been followed by a bust.

So Much for Solar Power

> An astronomer was giving a luncheon talk to a local group, and
> happened to mention that the sun would bum out in five billion years.
> An elderly woman in the front row gasped, and asked him to repeat it.
> When he did, she heaved a sigh of relief, \"Thank goodness, I thought
> you said million!\" (old joke)

This brings us back to the point that numbers matter. Just like
petroleum, the sun\'s fuel is finite-but don\'t expect a wave of solar
power cancellations when that realization goes around. Numbers tell us
that we don\'t need to worry about the \"finite\" nature of the sun\'s
fuel.

And while the petroleum resource is hardly comparable to the life of the
sun\'s fuel, the real issue is: how much is that resource, not whether
it is finite. Given their estimates of only 2-2.5 trillion barrels of
recoverable oil, half of which has been consumed, an argument of peak
oil advocates that scarcity is imminent seems credible. And this recalls
the neoMalthusian\' s error mentioned earlier; assume a static resource
and use a conservative number.

DEAD FROGS: THE BUGABOO OF EXPONENTIAL GROWTH

Thomas Malthus was one of many people who has observed that population
growth seemed to be outstripping the growth in agricultural production,
but being an economist, he didn\'t assume that this was somehow driven
by immutable natural laws and instead argued for agricultural reform to
increase food production.

More recently, [there has been a clamor about \"peak everything\" based
on the idea that, well, everything is finite and we \'re using it up, so
it is \"running out.\"]{.underline} Or at least, production must peak.
Or, as one physicist \[END OF PAGE 63\] points out, eventually human
energy production will generate as much heat as the sun does-eventually
being 1400 years.

Flat Earth

Colin Campbell, in the famed (well, famous in the IEA\'s offices) debate
at the IEA in 1997, compared resource optimists to the conservative
Spanish court that opposed the visionary, Columbus, and has since
referred to those, like Adelman and me, who disagreed with him as
\"flat-earth economists.\" Albert Bartlett later explained that the term
actually meant that economists thought the earth had two dimensions and
thus was infinite, containing equivalently infinite resources.

But [this description **ignores** two important variables: **capital and
knowledge**]{.underline}. [Additional investment can often increase the
production of renewables like agricultural products and nonrenewables
like minerals and oil in the same amount of space, as can **better
technology**]{.underline}. [Neo-Malthusians]{.underline} tend to
**[ignore this factor]{.underline}** and argue that the rate of
technological advance (and greater scientific knowledge) has diminished
or disappeared, as described in Chapter 7.

The argument is somewhat specious and relies in part the question of the
finiteness of resources, discussed earlier-or a static measure of
resources and dynamic view of consumption, as in The Limits to Growth.

HOW LONG?

Perhaps the most important factor that raises skepticism is the fact
that at least some [exponential alarmists fear the distant
future]{.underline}. Any number of pundits have looked at long-term
forecasts of economic and/or technological development and characterized
them as foolish. We have no flying cars, nuclear power is not too cheap
to meter, and no one is eating Soylent Green. On the other hand, [most
of these **were not serious forecasting efforts**, but rather
**off-the-cuff remarks**]{.underline} (or the equivalent), [and those
making them were not particularly serious about achieving them within a
specific time frame]{.underline}. And we do eat Soylent Green already;
only we call it tofu and vegemite. (Read the book, it wasn\'t people.)

NEWTON\'S FIRST LAW

[The biggest mistakes]{.underline} have [come from]{.underline} an
apparent source: [**extrapolation** of a trend **endlessly**, as if
there were no feedback or other variables]{.underline} \[END PAGE 64\]
[involved]{.underline}. Jay Forrester, the inventor of Systems Dynamics,
which was used in The Limits to Growth model (and which I have used),
reportedly once said that **[feedback effects]{.underline}** tend to
[**overwhelm** the initial stimuli]{.underline}, which is probably true
in many cases. [Yet]{.underline}, many neo[-Malthusians]{.underline} and
especially peak oil advocates tend to [extrapolate a given trend
endlessly, assuming no feedback effect whatsoever]{.underline}.

Indeed, the first wave of peak oil advocates explicitly argued that no
feedback effect would occur: prices didn\'t affect production or
consumption levels. Technological advances were either unimportant or
had ceased and so could not increase the resource base.

[An **important element** of the fear of exponential growth is the
analysts\' choice of **particularly high** growth rates]{.underline}. As
Figure 4.1 showed, [Ehrlich chose the **highest observed** growth in the
20th century for his calculations, even though it represented the
post-World War II **baby boom** and should have been considered **an
exception**]{.underline}, not the norm. [Similarly,
Bartlett]{.underline}, writing in 1998, [talks about the growth in oil
demand]{.underline} from the 1950s and 1960s [at 7% a year]{.underline},
which causes a doubling of use every decade, 25 [which sounds
alarming]{.underline}, given the arguments about the difficulty of
making a speedy energy transition, [until you realize that consumption
growth dropped to 3% per year in the]{.underline} 19[70s]{.underline} (a
doubling time of 24 years), [and]{.underline} under [**1% per year** in
the]{.underline} 19[80s]{.underline} (a doubling period of 75 years),
before recovering to 1.5% in the seven years before his talk (48 years).

[This emphasizes the lack of feedback mechanism used in these simplistic
models and how important they are in the real world]{.underline}.

REAL SCARCITY

Indeed, [the subtext of the fear of resource scarcity is that renewable
resources have repeatedly been the source of problems]{.underline}. In
**[Tainter]{.underline}**\'s The Collapse of Complex Societies, he
[talks about resources as causing the fall of a number of]{.underline}
(mostly) [ancient civilizations; **nearly all** suffered from problems
like lengthy droughts and salt buildup in irrigated
farmland]{.underline}. 26

And similar problems continue today, especially if you consider
endangered species, from rhinos to tuna. In all cases, these are
renewable resources, the very ones that are NOT finite, that are
sustainable, that we can rely on for all eternity-in theory. [**No
lasting shortage** of nonrenewable resources minerals and energy-has
occurred **since the advent of the global economy**]{.underline}.

#### Growth solves environmental damage -- proves the system is sustainable which takes out their impact calc -- structural changes, clean tech, and public pressure.

energy consumption on CO2 emissions: A revisited Environmental Kuznets
Curve approach." *Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews* 54(Feb):
838-9. Emory Libraries.

Some seminal papers reveal that, [within the process of economic growth,
environmental pollution level first scales up and later scales
down]{.underline}. This is [an inverted U-shaped relationship between
GDP]{.underline} per capita [and pollution level]{.underline} (Grossman
and Krueger \[3,4\], Panayotou \[5\], Shafik \[6\], Selden and Song
\[7\]). Since this relationship resembles the relationship between GDP
per capita and income inequality produced by Kuznets \[8\], Panayotou
\[5\] calls it Environmental [Kuznets Curve (EKC)]{.underline}.

According to the EKC hypothesis, [the level of environmental
pollution]{.underline} initially intensifies because of economic growth,
later [tampers after GDP per capita reaches a threshold
value]{.underline} (Panayotou \[5\], Suri and Chapman \[9\]; Stern
\[10\]). Therefore, this hypothesis implies a dynamic process in which
[structural change occurs together with economic growth]{.underline}
(Dinda \[2\]). Grossman and Krueger \[3\] first clarify how the EKC
arises. They explore that [economic growth affects environmental quality
through three channels:]{.underline} (i) [scale effect,]{.underline}
(ii) [structural effect, and]{.underline} (iii) [technological
effect]{.underline}. Fig. 1 presents the EKC within the periods of (i),
(ii) and (iii).

According to the scale effect, given the level of technology, more
resources and inputs are employed to produce more commodities at the
beginning of economic growth path. Hence, more energy resources and
production will induce more waste and pollutant emissions, and the level
of environmental quality will get worse (Torras and Boyce \[11\], Dinda
\[2\], Prieur \[12\]). [The structural effect states that the economy
will have a structural transformation, and **economic growth will affect
environment positively** along with continuation of growth]{.underline}.
In other words, [as national production grows the structure of economy
changes]{.underline}, and [the share of less polluting economic
activities increases gradually]{.underline}. Besides, [an economy
experiences a transition from capital-intensive industrial sectors to
service sector and reaches technology-intensive knowledge
economy]{.underline} (the final stage of the structural change). Due to
the fact [that technology-intensive sectors utilize fewer natural
sources, the impact of these sectors on environmental pollution will be
less]{.underline}. The last channel of the growth process is the
technological effect channel. [Since a high-income economy can allocate
more resources for r]{.underline}esearch [and d]{.underline}evelopment
[expenditures, the new technological processes will emerge]{.underline}.
Thus, [the country will **replace old and dirty
tech**]{.underline}nologies **[with new and clean
tech]{.underline}**nologies, [and environmental quality will
deepen]{.underline} (Borghesi \[13\], Copelan and Taylor \[14\]).
Consequently, [environmental pollution]{.underline} initially increases
and later [decreases as a result of scale, structural and
tech]{.underline}nological [effect emerging along with growth
path]{.underline}.

Some studies of EKC hypothesis consider income elasticity of clean
environment demand (Beckerman \[15\], Selden and Song \[16\], McConnel
\[17\], Panayotou \[18\], Carson et al. \[19\], Brock and Taylor
\[20\]). Accordingly, the share of low-income people's expenditures for
food and basic necessities is higher than that of high-income societies'
expenditures for the same type of commodities (Engel's Law). [As income
level and life standards rise in conjunction with economic growth, the
societies' demand for clean environment advances]{.underline}. Besides,
[societies make often pressure on policy makers to protect the
environment through new regulations]{.underline}. One might argue that,
because of these reasons, clean environment is a luxury commodity and
the [demand elasticity of clean environment is higher than
unity]{.underline} (Dinda \[2\]).

6\. CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS Since the early 1970s,
especially after the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment
in 1972, [the relationship between production and environmental concerns
has been handled by different methods in different
disciplines]{.underline}. This is because the environment is of vital
importance for human life, and they are confronted with serious
environmental problems. The most important of these problems are as
follows: The risk of going over the environmental pollution assimilation
capacity; the difficulty in return of natural balance in the
environment; large-scale health problems caused by environmental
pollution; rapid depletion of natural resources; global warming and
climate change, and the resulting related natural disasters such as
floods; the reduction of biodiversity, air pollution, and soil
pollution. **[Empirical studies on the environmental
pollution]{.underline}**--[economic growth nexus explore the validity of
the **EKC hypothesis**]{.underline} which states that environmental
pollution will increase up to a certain threshold of income growth, and
after this threshold, will begin to decrease due to the demand for a
clean environment and structural and technological inputs. [If the EKC
hypothesis is valid, economic growth is both cause of and **solution to
environmental pollution**.]{.underline} This approach is often used when
arguing that countries should not compromise economic growth policies to
reduce environmental effects. The EKC hypothesis is not valid in cases
where economic growth that increased production is the only cause of
environmental pollution. This has accelerated the search to replace the
neoclassical growth strategy. Especially highlighted by the 1992 UNCED
conference in Rio de Janeiro, a win-win approach to understanding the
appropriate account of the ecological paradigm has gained importance in
recent years. Therefore, the validity of the EKC hypothesis is an
important issue in formulating economic growth policies for all
countries. [In this study, the following two samples are
used]{.underline}: (i) **[40 high income countries]{.underline}** (OECD
members and non-members) [and]{.underline} (ii) **[33 upper
middle-income countries]{.underline}**. [These countries are selected
according to data available from related income groups]{.underline}. The
results from the dynamic panel data methods are as follows: (i) The
Durbin--Hausman cointegration test shows that there is a long-term
relationship between variables. (ii) [The results from the CCE estimator
indicate that there **is evidence of validity of the EKC hypothesis in
developed countries**]{.underline}. (iii) [The EKC hypothesis is not
valid in the developing countries. These results show that economic
growth is **sufficient enough to safeguard environmental quality for
developed countries.** However, **developing countries have not yet
reached income levels high enough to be able to derive their turning
points**]{.underline}. [Therefore, to reduce environmental pollution
that comes with economic growth, **developing** countries should give
importance to R&D activities and institutionalization of environmental
awareness. An increase in environmental awareness is imperative and
developing and developed countries must not forget the fact that the
natural world of tomorrow will be created today.]{.underline} Also, [our
findings show that **trade liberalization is not harmful for the
environment** in developed and developing countries]{.underline}. [This
means that the increase of trade volume **will not produce more carbon
emissions**]{.underline}. Despite the results obtained for the developed
countries, we cannot assume that environmental betterment will continue
to accompany further growth of per capita income in developed countries.
So that, future studies can examine the relationship between economic
growth and other pollutants. Because, along with the economic growth it
may increase the amount of other pollutants.

## AT: Queer Futurity K 

### Alt Fails 

#### Refusal of queer critique to engage the state recreates neoliberal ideology by falsely staticizing the state as always violent\-\--tactical engagement is better than pure rejection 

Nikita **Dhawan 15**, Professor of Political Science (Political Theory
and Gender Studies) and Director of the Research Platform Gender
Studies: \"Identities -- Discourses -- Transformations\" at the
University of Innsbruck, Austria, Homonationalism and State-phobia: The
Postcolonial Predicament of Queering Modernities, Academia.edu

As Foucault himself warns [state-phobia is deeply inscribed in liberal
and neo-liberal ideas of civil society]{.underline}. The wickedness of
the state is juxta- posed against the inherent goodness of civil
society, so that the aim is the 'whithering away of the state'. This
anti-state-centric approach to political power, locates radical politics
in extra-state space of innovation. This is why [Puar]{.underline} and
others reject pragmatic politics of same-sex marriage or
anti-discrimination legislations. [In contrast they support civil
society campaigns like pink-watching that increasingly deploy the
strategy of surveillance for shaming states into good
behavior.]{.underline} Even as one critiques the harnessing of gender
and sexuality by neo-liberal capitalism, [the rejection of all feminist-
queer politics oriented towards the state as part of a biopolitical
agenda is disingenuous state-phobic rhetoric.]{.underline}

[Postcolonial-queer-feminists are caught in an ambivalent, double-bind
vis-à-vis the state: On the one hand, the state has historically been
the source of violence and repression]{.underline} through the
criminalization and pathologization of non-normative sexual practices.
[And yet, queer strategies seek to instru- mentalize the state to
promote sexual justice. Even as the state is known to perpetuate
heteronormative ideologies, which are **founding myths of
nations,**]{.underline} [the hope is that the state can function as a
**site of redress**]{.underline} of gender and sexual inequality.
[Despite the problematic track-record with regard to sexual politics of
all nation-states]{.underline}, whether European or non-European, [it is
**dangerous to disregard the immense political implications of
state-phobic positions,**]{.underline} which are [increasingly popular
in radical discourses]{.underline} in the West.

As the recent re-criminalization of homosexuality in Uganda, India and
Nigeria demonstrate, negotiations with state are indispensable and
imperative for emancipatory queer politics in the global South. [This is
not a plea for statism; rather, one must be aware of the dangers of the
replacement of state with non-state actors as motors of
justice]{.underline}. Against this background, [the recent anti-statist
stance within postcolonial queer scholarship is alarming, as it ignores
the importance of the state for those citizens who do not have access to
transnational counterpublic spheres to address their
grievances]{.underline}.

[Decolonization, whether in USA, Israel or India**, cannot be
achieved**]{.underline} [merely through a strategy of **shaming the
state.**]{.underline} [Rather]{.underline} in the Gramscian- Spivakian
sense, [it is imperative to enable vulnerable disenfranchised indi-
viduals and groups to **access the state**]{.underline} (Dhawan 􀀲􀀰􀀱􀀳).
[Accordingly, **instead of a for or against position vis-à-vis the
state,**]{.underline} [the more challenging question is]{.underline}
**[how to reconﬁgure the state,]{.underline}** [given that its
institutions and policies are the]{.underline} **[mobile eﬀect of a
regime of multiple governmentalities]{.underline}**. Thus [the chal-
lenge is how to pursue a **non-statephobic queer politics**]{.underline}
[that at the same time]{.underline} **[neither rationalizes the
biopolitical state]{.underline}** project [**nor makes the queer bodies
governable**. In postcolonial contexts, the state is like a
pharmakon]{.underline} , namely, [both poison and medicine. Postcolonial
queer politics must explore strategies of converting poison into
counterpoison]{.underline} (Spivak 􀀲􀀰􀀰􀀷: 􀀷􀀱).

Herein [the ambivalent function of the state must be
addressed]{.underline}. As Pharmakon, [the inherent condradictions must
be engaged with: Violence and justice, ideology and emancipation, law
and discipline. If,]{.underline} following Foucault, [the state has no
stable essence, then it is marked by undecidability or doubleness. The
sole focus on the negative aspects of the Pharmakon, namely the
destructive and repressive traits, **neutralizes and ignores the
enabling and empowering aspects**]{.underline}. Thus
[postcolonial-queer-feminist poli- tics must transform poison into
remedy and formulate critique of the state **beyond state-phobia**. A
challenging task, but **anything else would be too risky**!]{.underline}

#### Queer movements must work through the law\-\--can work to dismantle it but particular demands key

Dean **Spade 11,** Introduction: Rights, Movements, and Critical Trans
Politics, In NORMAL LIFE: Administrative Violence, Critical Trans
Politics, and the Limits of Law,
http://crg.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/Nov18-DeanSpadeReadings.pdf

[Trans people are told by the law]{.underline}, state agencies, private
discriminators, [and our families that we are impossible people who
cannot exist]{.underline}, cannot be seen, cannot be classi5ed, and
cannot 5t anywhere. [We are told by the better-funded lesbian and gay
rights groups, as they continually leave us aside, that we are not
politically viable]{.underline}; our lives are not a political
possibility that can be conceived. [Inside this impossibility, I argue,
lies our]{.underline} speci5c [political potential---a potential to
**formulate demands**]{.underline} and strategies to meet those demands
that exceed the containment of neoliberal politics. A critical trans
politics is emerging that refuses empty promises of "equal opportunity"
and "safety" underwritten by settler colonialism, racist, sexist,
classist, ableist, and xenophobic imprisonment, and ever-growing wealth
disparity. Its politics aims to center the concerns and leadership of
the most vulnerable and to build transformative change through
mobilization. [It is reconceptualizing the role of law reform in social
movements]{.underline}, acknowledging that legal equality demands are a
feature of systemic injustice, not a remedy. [It is confronting the
harms that come to trans people at the hands of violent systems
structured **through law itself**---not by demanding
recognition]{.underline} and inclusion [in those systems, but **by
working to dismantle them while simultaneously supporting those most
exposed to their harms**. Its critical trans politics is part of a
larger framework of resistance that must grapple with the complex
relationships between power, law, and violence, and the obstacles social
movements are facing]{.underline} in the context of neoliberalism.

#### Orienting queer resistance towards [negation]{.underline} and [failure]{.underline} locks in a purely reactionary politics and [actively precludes]{.underline} articulation of hopeful futures \-\-- engagement with the [particular context]{.underline} of militarism is vital 

Kim Q. **Hall 14**, Professor of Philosophy and Faculty Affiliate of
Women\'s Studies and Sustainable Development, Appalachian State
University, 2014, "No Failure: Climate Change, Radical Hope, and Queer
Crip Feminist Eco-Futures," Radical Philosophy Review, Vol. 17, No. 1,
p. 203-225

[If queer is by definition a failed identity with no
future,]{.underline} [is there any non-naïve way in which there could be
hope for queers?]{.underline} [Could this hope be radical?]{.underline}
[I]{.underline} certainly [appreciate Halberstam's point]{.underline}
and agree [that queer has been associated with failure]{.underline} to
achieve heteronormative happiness and success. [Nonetheless, I am
concerned that]{.underline} [embracing failure leaves only a reactionary
role for queer resistance]{.underline}. In other words, [queer
resistance,]{.underline} [when understood as failure, becomes a mere
rejection of hope]{.underline}, [which is understood as only a
heteronormative affect]{.underline}. [Because this]{.underline}
ultimately [limited conception of queer resistance]{.underline} [does
not reflect our naturecultural being in the world]{.underline}, [it
is]{.underline} [unable to address how modes of life and thinking among
global elites have contributed to a toxic environment for human and
nonhuman bodies and communities]{.underline}.

[In addition to efforts to conceive of queerness]{.underline}, gender,
and disability [in ways that remain open to possible transnational
alliances]{.underline}, [a critically radical conception of queerness
must also,]{.underline} to borrow from Rosi Braidotti, "[strike . . . an
alliance with the productive and immanent force of zoē, or life in its
non-human aspects]{.underline}. This requires a mutation of our shared
understanding of what it means to think at all, let alone think
critically."46 While I am wary of Braidotti's reference to a "shared
understanding,"47 her claim presents a provocative challenge to
persistent anthropomorphisms in feminist, queer, and disability studies.

[Being radical]{.underline}, at least in part, [is]{.underline} [being
critically aware of and accountable to]{.underline} [the historical,
economic, social, and political contexts in which one
lives]{.underline}. In this sense, [queer crip feminist critique is
radical to the extent that it not only understands identity as situated
within]{.underline} and shaped by [structures of power, but also to the
extent that it]{.underline} [strives to be cognizant of its impact on
those structures of power]{.underline}. It is this radical conception of
situatedness and contingency that Diana Coole and Samantha Frost seem to
have in mind when they characterize new materialist critique as

#### Revolutionary queer demands undermine nuanced analysis of actual, localized resistances to heteronormativity

In contrast to this, Duggan delimits her target and devises a strategy
that¶ bypasses this stereotypical!)\' queer \'relational politics of

non-heterosexualities within contemporary¶ America, that is, the
state\'s complicity with heteronormativity.¶ [The primary difference
between the approach demonstrated in Homosexuality,]{.underline}¶ [Law

[Every movement has its sell-by date]{.underline}. I think that [[there
were a lot of flaws in]{.mark} the way that [Afro-Futurism]{.mark}
unfolded]{.underline}, and [I think [it missed]{.mark} certain [pressure
points in]{.mark} the flow of how [culture]{.mark} evolves in this day
and age]{.underline}. [It wasn't digital enough, it [didn't have a core
group of people with any kind of coherent message. It was conceptually
open ended without any kind of narrative]{.mark}]{.underline}. People
tend to like that kind of thing. [I speak of Afro-Futurism in the past
tense because I think that the culture at large caught up to and
bypassed many of the issues it was dealing with.]{.underline} Forget the
idea of the "permanent underclass" that people like Greg Tate (no
disrespect) kept pushing. Forget the idea that blacks are outside of any
system---we are the system. I guess that many people outside of the arts
have awakened to the day and age and moved on. [It seemed like
[Afrofuturism]{.mark} just [didn't have a cohesive situation to]{.mark}
have music, art and literature [evolve from.]{.mark} Sure,
[Afrofuturism]{.mark} can be used, as you put it to be a "descriptor of
a body of knowledge, which does not die and outlives its
progenitors]{.underline} (like jazz, hip-hop, deconstruction, or
philosophy itself)"---[but only by sleight of hand]{.underline} (which
is sampling, anyway). [[It's basically a hall of mirrors,]{.mark} a

### AT: Black Panther 

#### The myth of Wakanda wishes away the material reality of poverty under global capitalism and circulates anti-black tropes about the cultural value of technology and the nature of black protest 

**Haider 18** (Asad - PhD candidate in the History of Consciousness at
UC Santa Cruz and founding Editor of *Viewpoint Magazine*, "Black
Atlantis," 3/5/18,

In a sweeping survey of Ta-Nehisi Coates's place in the liberal rhetoric
of the most recent turn of the century, Pankaj Mishra points to Coates's
struggle with a disconcerting question: "Why do white people like what I
write?" We might also ask why white people like the film Black Panther,
which, according to the director Ryan Coogler, was inspired not only by
Coates's work on the Marvel comic books but also his writings on race
and identity. At an event in Harlem's Apollo Theater, Coates described
the film as "Star Wars for black people," rhapsodizing that the film was
"an incredible achievement. I didn't realize how much I needed the film,
a hunger for a myth that \[addressed\] feeling separated and feeling
reconnected." Indeed, like Star Wars, [**[Black Panther presents us not
with science fiction but with myth]{.mark}**, sharing with it what [we
might describe as "semi-feudal futurism"]{.mark} -- a term far more
appropriate for this film than "Afrofuturism," thrown around in the
mainstream media stripped of any meaningful political
context.]{.underline} [Why do white people love Black
Panther]{.underline}, just as they love Star Wars? If we take a cynical
look, we might conclude that it is because [[**two classic modes of
white racism are reproduced in Black Panther.** First, **the notion that
the value of a culture and people lies in the extent of its
technological development**,]{.mark} a condition rendered as a natural
property rather than one which results from an unequal global division
of labor and distribution of wealth. [Second, **that the opposition of
the oppressed to their oppressors amounts to nihilistic violence**,
practiced by criminals with unworthy intentions.]{.mark}]{.underline} If
we are more forgiving of the white audience -- that is, assuming their
condescending benevolence -- we might conclude that the appeal of
[[Black Panther]{.underline}]{.mark} lies not in the racist stereotypes
it reinforces, but in the way it [[discredits the ideals of emancipation
and egalitarianism and replaces them with privilege and
philanthropy.]{.underline}]{.mark} Following Parliament-Funkadelic's
1977 indictment, in the year of Star Wars, of the commercialization and
containment of the radical potential of black music, let's call this
mythology "the placebo syndrome." In the recent sequels, the semi-feudal
futurism of Star Wars has been updated for an audience perhaps even less
credulous of monarchies than it was in 1977, with Princess Leia
converted into a general of a more or less republican anti-imperialist
resistance. Black Panther is monarchist without apology. Its semi-feudal
futurism is combined with the cultural nationalism historically
associated not with the nominally connected Black Panther Party, but its
adversary Ron Karenga's US Organization -- with which the Panthers had a
violent shootout at UCLA leading to the deaths of Los Angeles Panther
Captain Bunchy Carter and Deputy Minister John Huggins. [In [Black
Panther]{.mark}, we are [present]{.mark}ed with [a mythology that makes
anti-imperialist resistance unnecessary. In]{.mark} the Marvel myth
of]{.underline} the African nation of [[Wakanda,]{.underline}]{.mark}
initially created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby and brought to the big
screen by Disney, [[Third World poverty is not a result of the ravages
of colonialism and]{.mark} the uneven exploitation of [global
capitalism. Rather, this poverty simply does not exist]{.mark} -- it is
an illusion intended to hide the wealth cultivated and protected by an
African monarchy from time immemorial. Development exceeding that of
advanced capitalism has already been achieved within a semi-feudal mode
of production protected in the boundaries of a
nation-state.]{.underline} Our hero is the monarch T'Challa, whose
drug-induced physical strength allows him to function as an isolationist
superhero, keeping Wakanda's wealth hidden from the outside world. In
this mission he relies equally on a dizzying array of advanced
technological gadgetry, reminiscent of imperialist agent James Bond. But
the Wakandan monarchy has a dirty secret. T'Challa's father T'Chaka
murdered his brother N'Jobu, who while undercover in Oakland -- the city
where Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale founded the Black Panther Party in
1966 -- had come to the conclusion that Wakanda's advanced technology
should be used to liberate black people around the world from poverty
and oppression. Because this posed a threat to Wakanda's national
sovereignty, N'Jobu was eliminated and his son abandoned to grow up
without his father. N'Jobu's son, Erik "Killmonger" Stevens, rises up
with the goal not only of avenging his father's murder, but also of
claiming the Wakandan monarchy and using it to realize his father's
dream of international revolution. "Two billion people all over the
world who look like us whose lives are much harder, and Wakanda has the
tools to liberate them all," he says to a skeptical Wakandan nobility.
"Where was Wakanda?" These two political visions -- of a global
insurrection against oppression and the defense of the nation-state --
are played out in the contest for the throne between the African monarch
T'Challa and the urban African-American Killmonger, who the Wakandan
nobility scorn as an "outsider." As Christopher Lebron writes in Boston
Review: Rather than the enlightened radical, \[Killmonger\] comes across
as the black thug from Oakland hell bent on killing for killing's
sake---indeed, his body is marked with a scar for every kill he has
made. [The abundant evidence of his efficacy does not establish
Killmonger as a hero or villain so much as a receptacle for tropes of
inner-city gangsterism.]{.underline} T'Challa's eventual victory against
Killmonger is not achieved by African initiative alone, as the core
figure of critical race theory Kimberlé Crenshaw has written. The visual
spectacle of the film, Crenshaw reflects, "sucked me in like a narcotic
and had me accepting things that made my heart ache upon reflection."
Its exuberant celebration of a purportedly timeless African essence
represses its complicity with the history of racist violence. In
Crenshaw's words: A civil war between Black families was unfolding over
aiding other Black people, and... [the CIA's shooting down of vessels
carrying technology into the fight against an anti-black world order was
hailed as a heroic moment]{.underline}... I kept wondering how I'd come
to dance on the table for the CIA? The ones that helped destroy the
dream of African liberation, that had a hand in the assassination of
Lumumba, staged a coup against Nkrumah, tipped off the arrest that
imprisoned Mandela, installed the vicious, nation-destroying Mobutu? Why
not throw in the FBI and COINTELPRO as kindly white characters? Was this
meant to be ironic? What meaning do we assign the fact that the
possibility of a real life Wakanda in the resource-rich Congo and Ghana,
and the promise of a Pan African quest for collective self-determination
were precisely the threats that the CIA worked to suppress?
