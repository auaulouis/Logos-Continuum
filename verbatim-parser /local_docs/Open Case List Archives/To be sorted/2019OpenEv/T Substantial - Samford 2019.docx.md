### 1NC- Substantial

#### Definition -- substantially means large in size -- consensus of dictionaries proves

**Lee 85 (**JUDGE DISTRICT COURT FOR NORTHERN DISTRICT OF INDIANA,
CENTRAL STATES SOUTHEAST & SOUTHWEST AREAS PENSION FUND V B..., 610 F
SUPP 1505, p. lexis)

[In an attempt to ascertain the common \[\*\*15\] meaning of the term
\"substantially,\" the court consulted **several
dictionaries**.]{.underline} Many **[define the term as
meaning]{.underline}** \"of ample or **[considerable amount, size, or
quantity]{.underline}**,\" see e.g., Random House Dictionary of the
English Language, p. 1418. Webster\'s Third New International
Dictionary, p. 2280, defines \"substantially\" as \"being that specified
to a large degree or in the main.\" **[Webster\'s goes on to list
\"massive\" as the synonym of \"substantially]{.underline}**.\" These
definitions indicate that the common meaning of the phrase
\"substantially all\" must be something which indicates \"a large
degree\" or \"large amount\" of all; the terms \"almost all\" or
\"nearly all,\" though admittedly imprecise, capture the essence of the
phrase. If \"substantially\" is synonymous with \"massive,\" then
\"substantially all\" must mean some percentage which is very near 100%.

#### Violation- oversight affs aren't reductions- Oversight opens up dozens of mechanisms that don't link to generics

**Kaiser**, specialist in American national government, Congressional
Research Service, **1988** (Frederick, Congressional Oversight of the
Presidency, Annals of the AAPSS,
https://www.jstor.org/stable/1045819?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)

[Congressional oversight of the executive]{.underline}, including the
presidency itself, has evidently increased over the past two decades. It
[relies upon a **wide variety of techniques and**]{.underline} occurs in
a number of **[settings]{.underline}**, [not just]{.underline} select
committee [**investigations** or]{.underline} specialized subcommittee
**[hearings]{.underline}** labeled oversight. Other [means range
from]{.underline} hearings on [authorizations]{.underline} and regular
bills [to **informal meetings**]{.underline} between legislators and
executive officials; [and]{.underline} from House **[impeachment
proceedings]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} the use of offices outside
Congress, such as [inspectors general and independent
counsels]{.underline}. Oversight does not exist in a political vacuum;
the impetus behind it is often a conflict between the two branches over
public policy or over competing institutional interests and powers. In
addition, the apparent growth in the amount of oversight and the wide
use of different means are the results of changes in Congress, including
improved resources and incentives for members, changes in the
presidency, especially the expanded operational role of its personnel;
and changes in the polity, such as the rise of investigative journalism
and electoral developments that have helped to divide party control of
government.

#### Topicality is a voting issue

#### Permitting tiny oversight reductions in arms sales explodes limits on an already large topic, which destroys clash, exacerbates research burdens, and incentivizes negs to read anti-educational and cheating generics like consult, agent, or offsets CPs

### 2NC/1NR- AT: Substantially Means Considerable

#### Arbitrary -- there's no objective determination of what is 'considerable' 

**Stark 97** (Stephen J., "Key Words And Tricky Phrases: An Analysis Of
Patent Drafter\'s Attempts To Circumvent The Language Of 35 U.S.C.",
Journal of Intellectual Property Law, Fall, 5 J. Intell. Prop. L. 365,
Lexis)

1\. Ordinary Meaning. First, words in a patent are to be given their
ordinary meaning unless otherwise defined.
[30](http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=1421887dc00d6c0b78bddb20857a69fa&docnum=20&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVzW-zSkAz&_md5=3f3ffe65eadff46b38ea49c40cb1037e&focBudTerms=definition%20of%20the%20term%21%20substantial%21%20or%20definition%20of%20the%20word%20substantial%21&focBudSel=all#n30)
However, what if a particular word has multiple meanings? For example,
[consider the word \"substantial.\"]{.underline} The Webster dictionary
gives eleven different definitions of the word substantial.
[31](http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=1421887dc00d6c0b78bddb20857a69fa&docnum=20&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVzW-zSkAz&_md5=3f3ffe65eadff46b38ea49c40cb1037e&focBudTerms=definition%20of%20the%20term%21%20substantial%21%20or%20definition%20of%20the%20word%20substantial%21&focBudSel=all#n31)
Additionally, there are another two definitions specifically provided
for the adverb \"substantially.\"
[32](http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=1421887dc00d6c0b78bddb20857a69fa&docnum=20&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVzW-zSkAz&_md5=3f3ffe65eadff46b38ea49c40cb1037e&focBudTerms=definition%20of%20the%20term%21%20substantial%21%20or%20definition%20of%20the%20word%20substantial%21&focBudSel=all#n32)
Thus, the \"**[ordinary meaning\" is not clear.]{.underline}** The first
definition of the word \"substantial\" given by the Webster\'s
Dictionary is \"of ample or considerable amount, quantity, size, etc.\"
[33](http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=1421887dc00d6c0b78bddb20857a69fa&docnum=20&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVzW-zSkAz&_md5=3f3ffe65eadff46b38ea49c40cb1037e&focBudTerms=definition%20of%20the%20term%21%20substantial%21%20or%20definition%20of%20the%20word%20substantial%21&focBudSel=all#n33)
Supposing that this is the precise definition that the drafter had in
mind when drafting the patent, [the meaning of]{.underline} \"ample or
[considerable amount]{.underline}\" **[appears amorphous]{.underline}**.
[This could have one of at least the following
interpretations:]{.underline} (1) [almost all]{.underline}, (2) [more
than half, or]{.underline} (3) [barely enough to do the
job]{.underline}. Therefore, the use of a term, such as \"substantial,\"
which usually has a very ambiguous meaning, makes the scope of
protection particularly hard to determine.

### 2NC/1NR- AT: Reasonability

#### Reasonability doesn't apply when debating the meaning of "substantial" 

**Kleunener v Commissions of Internal Revenue 98** (154 F.3d 630,
https://www.casemine.com/judgement/us/5914bb85add7b04934797372)

Substantial authority exists only if the weight of the taxpayer\'s
authorities is substantial in relation to the contrary authorities. 26
C.F.R. § 1.6662-4(d)(3) (1997). \"**[Substantial\" means]{.underline}**
something less than a preponderance, but **[more than a mere reasonable
basis]{.underline}**. Id. at § 1.6662-4(d)(2). \"Authority\" includes
several sources of law, such as statutes, court cases, legislative
history, and regulations, although none of these is particularly
relevant if \"materially distinguishable\" on its facts. See id. at §
1.6662-4(d)(3)(ii). The taxpayer\'s subjective belief that there is
substantial authority is irrelevant. Id. at § 1.6662-4(d)(3)(i).

#### Using reasonability to assess the meaning of 'substantial' is intellectually lazy and amplifies ambiguity 

**Brennan 88** (Justice, Pierce v. Underwood (Supreme Court Decision),
487 U.S. 552, http://socsec.law.
cornell.edu/cgi-bin/foliocgi.exe/socsec_case_full/query=%5Bjump!3A!27487+u!2Es!2E+552+opinion+n1!2
7%5D/doc/%7B@ 825%7D?)

The underlying problem with the Court\'s methodology is that it uses
words or terms with similar, but not identical, meanings as a substitute
standard, rather than as an aid in choosing among the assertedly
different meanings of the statutory language. Thus, [instead of relying
on]{.underline} the [**legislative history** and **other tools of
interpretation**]{.underline} [to help resolve the ambiguity in the word
\"substantial,\" the Court uses those tools]{.underline} essentially
[to]{.underline} [jettison the phrase crafted by Congress]{.underline}.
This point is well illustrated by the Government\'s position in this
case. [Not content with the term \"substantially justified,\" the
Government asks us to hold that it may avoid fees if its position was
\"reasonable.\"]{.underline} Not satisfied even with that substitution,
we are asked to hold that a position is \"reasonable\" if \"it has some
substance and a fair possibility of success.\" Brief for Petitioner 13.
While each of the Government\'s successive definitions may not stray too
far from the one before, the end product is significantly removed from
\"substantially justified.\" I believe that Congress intended the EAJA
to do more than award fees where the Government\'s position was one
having no substance, or only a slight possibility of success; I would
hope that the Government rarely engages in litigation fitting that
definition, and surely not often enough to warrant the \$ 100 million in
attorney\'s fees Congress expected to spend over the original EAJA\'s
5-year life. My view that [\"**substantially** justified\" **means more
than merely reasonable**]{.underline}, aside from conforming to the
words Congress actually chose, is bolstered by the EAJA\'s legislative
history. The phrase \"substantially justified\" was a congressional
attempt to fashion a \"middle ground\" between an earlier, unsuccessful
proposal to award fees in all cases in which the Government did not
prevail, and the Department of Justice\'s proposal to award fees only
when the Government\'s position was \"arbitrary, frivolous,
unreasonable, or groundless.\" S. Rep., at 2-3. Far from occupying the
middle ground, \"the test of reasonableness\" is firmly encamped near
the position espoused by the Justice Department. Moreover, the 1985
House Committee Report pertaining to the EAJA\'s reenactment expressly
states that \"substantially justified\" means more than \"mere
reasonableness.\" H. R. Rep. No. 99-120, p. 9 (1985). Although I agree
with the Court that this Report is not dispositive, the Committee\'s
unequivocal rejection of a pure \"reasonableness\" standard in the
course of considering the bill reenacting the EAJA is deserving of some
weight. Finally, however lopsided the weight of authority in the lower
courts over the meaning of \"substantially justified\" might once have
been, lower court opinions are no longer nearly unanimous. The District
of Columbia, Third, Eighth, and Federal Circuits have all adopted a
standard higher than mere reasonableness, and the Sixth Circuit is
considering the question en banc. See Riddle v. Secretary of Health and
Human Services, [817 F.2d
1238](http://socsec.law.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/foliocgi.exe/socsec_case_full/query=%5BJUMP:%27817+F%212E2d+1238%27%5D/doc/%7B@1%7D?firsthit)
(CA6) (adopting a higher standard), vacated for rehearing en banc, 823
F.2d 164 (1987); Lee v. Johnson, 799 F.2d 31 (CA3 1986); United States
v. 1,378.65 Acres of Land, 794 F.2d 1313 (CA8 1986); Gavette v. OPM, 785
F.2d 1568 (CA Fed. 1986) (en banc); Spencer v. NLRB, 229 U. S. App. D.
C. 225, 712 F.2d 539 (1983). In sum, the [Court\'s journey from
\"substantially]{.underline} justified\" [to \"reasonable
basis]{.underline} both in law and fact\" to \"the test of
reasonableness\" [does not crystallize the law, nor is it true to
Congress\' intent. Instead, it allows the Government to]{.underline}
**[creep the standard]{.underline}** [towards \"having some
substance]{.underline} and a fair possibility of success,\" [a
position]{.underline} I believe [Congress intentionally
avoided]{.underline}. In my view, we should hold that the Government can
avoid fees only where it makes a clear showing that its position had a
solid basis (as opposed to a marginal basis or a not unreasonable basis)
in both law and fact. [That it may be less \"anchored\" than \"the test
of reasonableness,\" a debatable proposition,]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} **[no excuse]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[abandon
the test]{.underline}** [Congress enacted]{.underline}.

### 2NC/1NR- Merriam-Websters Good

#### Our definition is best -- Merriam Webster's is the most well-respected dictionary 

**Mandl 87** (Dave, Freelance writer/journalist + Editor at large @
Semiotext(e)/Autonomedia, \"Putting the Dick in Dictionary,\"
http://wfmu.org/\~davem/docs/dictionary.html)

While eight bits may not seem like much to pay for \"a comprehensive
guide to the English language,\" a lexicon that promises to \"improve
the language skills of homemakers, students, and professionals,\" the
slim paperback known as [the New Concise Webster\'s]{.underline} (and
published by Modern Publishing, NYC) is as likely to meet your
dictionary needs as a plate of ravioli. [The name]{.underline},
undoubtedly used in an attempt to dupe the inexperienced dictionary
buyer, [is of course meaningless: \"Webster\'s,\" like \"Roget\'s,\" is
in the public domain,]{.underline} and ironically, [when used on
anything but the **well-respected Merriam-Webster**]{.underline} and
Webster\'s New World [dictionaries, is a **virtual guarantee of an
inferior product**]{.underline}. Not that you need any extra clues in
the case of the NCW: unidentified mystery symbols, ultra-minimalist
definitions that give new meaning to the word concise (just as well,
since it isn\'t defined in the dictionary), and an entry-count barely
into five figures make this a reference book you\'ll want to hide well
when company comes over. Although the editors of the NCW shun all
unnecessary frills\--like syllabifications and etymologies of any
kind\--to focus all their energy on definitions, the dictionary will
probably not have rival definers flying into a jealous rage. Terseness
is valued by all lexicographers, but the NCW takes the idea perhaps one
step too far. For example, flute is defined, somewhat ambiguously, as
\"a musical instrument which you blow.\" This doesn\'t cause any real
conflicts, since the editors omit piccolo, oboe, and flugelhorn, and
thus save themselves some fancy explaining. But the pithy definition of
food\--\"what you eat\"\--is more troublesome. Given such vague
guidelines, a well-meaning boy scout putting together a CARE package for
Iranian earthquake victims, for example, might be fooled into including
anything from a tab of acid to\--well, use your imagination. And how
will devotees of Ultra Slim-Fast and Carnation Instant Breakfast feel
about having their favorite foods implicitly excluded? Other definitions
are so misleadingly simple as to be alarmist (\"a small animal that
flies at night\" = bat) or downright dangerous (\"red spots on the
skin\" = rash). In an apparent effort not to offend or intimidate any
potential customers, the editors of the NCW scrupulously avoid dealing
with some of the more controversial issues and concepts of our time.
Existence is defined simply as \"being\"; the definition of time is
given as \"minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years\"; and zero is
\"the number 0.\" The complexities of capital, even in the nerve center
of world finance that is apparently the dictionary\'s primary market,
are easily evaded: it\'s either \"the chief city of a country\" or \"a
large letter.\" Entries for sex (except in the harmless \"gender\"
sense) and abortion are conspicuously absent. And while god is spelled
with a lower-case g, this can (very plausibly) be attributed to sloppy
typesetting. Those with exotic tastes may not be able to resist skipping
directly to the \"X\" section, but they\'re sure to be disappointed: the
lone entry for the letter is x-ray\--no xenon, xenophobia, xanthoma, or
even Xmas. Missing too is xylophone, though this is easily explained:
its definition (\"a musical instrument which you hit\"?) would have
conflicted with that of drum. Also of interest to curiosity-seekers is
the word set: well known for having the longest entry in the massive
Oxford English Dictionary, it towers over most entries in the NCW as
well, filling no less than half of one its large-print, two-inch-wide
columns (though this does include the accompanying line drawings). And
in a quaint Anglophilic touch, the word queue (noun and verb) is
included, an extravagant move for a dictionary that omits gel, compact,
and tuna. The pronunciations in the NCW are generally accurate, though
with so few words of more than two syllables there isn\'t much of a
challenge. The occasional foray into polysyllabic territory sometimes
proves to be more than the dictionary can handle: overnight is listed as
rhyming with knit, for example; environment\'s r is stuck in the wrong
place and its n is omitted altogether. (The inclusion of the shwa\--a
valuable symbol neglected even by some of the best dictionaries\--is a
pleasant surprise, however.) And just what do the little circles next to
about half the entries mean? There\'s not a clue in the Guide on pages 4
and 5. The NCW, in short, is a staggeringly bad dictionary. Its main
strength, of course, is its \$1 street price (its official cover price
is actually \$3.95), but [if you want a dictionary that doesn\'t
underestimate the intelligence of even first-graders]{.underline} (as
this one does) [you\'re]{.underline} better off\--[much better
off]{.underline}\--doing without breakfast for a week and **[picking up
Merriam-Webster]{.underline}**, the American Heritage, or Webster\'s New
World. Those for whom money is no object may prefer Webster\'s Third New
International (\$89) or the awesome twenty-volume OED (\$2500), and
that\'s their right\--the important thing is to leave the mountains of
the New Concise Webster\'s for degenerate Wall Street professionals and
those foolish enough to buy books from street vendors with licenses.

### 2AC- T Substantial

#### We meet- the plan is a substantial reduction of sales- stops most new arms deals

**Shinkman '18** (Paul D. Shinkman, Senior National Security Writer,
"Trump to Speed Up U.S. Arms Sales by Reducing Oversight, Sources Say",

February 5, 2018)

[The White House reportedly plans to change a little-known government
procedure that will accelerate some weapons sales abroad. THE WHITE
HOUSE IS pushing to implement as early as March a plan that would make
it easier to sell some weapons to foreign partners through a process
some say eliminates key regulatory and congressional oversight,
government officials and staffers tell U.S. News.]{.underline} The
proposal, first reported by Reuters in September, would affect the sale
of small weapons and ammunition, delighting proponents who say the
current process is too cumbersome while raising concerns among some
experts about the risk of deadly arms falling into the wrong hands.
RELATED CONTENT Is \'Great-Power Competition\' Worth Billions? [The new
rules would transfer the oversight for the U.S. to sell some weapons
like rifles and shotguns, as well as the ammunition for them, from the
State Department to the Commerce Department, which some experts and
officials say is far less prepared than its internationally oriented
counterpart to vet potential foreign buyers.]{.underline} The initiative
-- first considered under the Obama administration but reportedly nixed
in the wake of the 2012 mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado -- is part of
broader efforts by the White House revealed in recent months to
accelerate U.S. arms sales, even encouraging Defense Department
officials to act as pitchmen abroad. It hopes to speed up a process that
top officials, including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, say is a key
element for strengthening America\'s partnerships abroad. [But what
proponents tout as the beginning of long-awaited changes to a cumbersome
process that can at times take years is seen by other experts as a
dangerous precedent that would improve the chances of U.S. weaponry
being misused or falling into the hands of groups like al-Qaida or the
Islamic State group.]{.underline}

[Congress has crafted an elaborate statutory regime to prevent the
export of U.S. weapons that would threaten U.S. interests. That regime
includes restrictions on the export of defense items and services to
individuals engaged in human rights abuses. **Items having "substantial
military utility" are subject to special controls**\[5\] by law,
including registration requirements, rigorous licensing requirements,
re-export restrictions, end-use monitoring, reporting requirements to
Congress, and criminal penalties and disbarment from federal contracts
for violators.]{.underline} Administration officials have asserted
authority to transfer jurisdiction over exports of military equipment,
including items such as semiautomatic firearms that clearly have
substantial military utility, to the Commerce Department. Such a
transfer of jurisdiction would mean that the export of such items would
no longer be subject to the special controls established for significant
military equipment, thus creating a greater risk of illicit transfers.

[The AECA, which currently authorizes the State Department to regulate
arms exports, was amended to specifically address the problem of weapons
brokers,\[18\] **who play a substantial role in facilitating and stoking
the global market**]{.underline}. Reaching their activities has been an
important policy priority and has led to successful prosecutions.\[19\]
There is no comparable extension of authority over brokers under
Commerce Department regulations. There is broader language that extends
criminal liability to anyone who "aids or abets in the commission of a
violation."\[20\] The recent expansion of the Commerce Department's
regulatory authority to specifically impose responsibility on
corporations or other legal entities that enable or assist in export
control violations may help reduce this problem.\[21\] More broadly, it
is imperative that prosecution of illicit arms traffickers not be
weakened by the proposed transfer of export control authority. Although
President Barack Obama's objective of simplifying the licensing process
is laudable, it is far more important to ensure that the United States
can effectively prosecute the agents and colleagues of arms traffickers
who violate the country's export control laws. The Solution [In light of
these concerns about the Commerce Department's authority and expertise
to oversee the export of arms, **no equipment or service with
substantial military utility should be made subject to that
department's** control. The administration could still transfer to the
Commerce Department control of the export of a great deal of equipment

If a legal regime provides no accommodations for religion, it need not
be overly concerned with whether its laws have the incidental effect of
burdening religion. But regimes that are open to accommodating religion
invariably need to know something about the burden imposed by their
laws. Legislators, administrators, and judges must then inquire about
the quality of the burden and evaluate the justification for
accommodation against other social interests. At the very least, as Kent
Greenawalt has argued, the alleged burden must be \"nontrivial.\" 14Link

require a good deal more in providing that the burden must be
\"substantial.\" 15Link to the text of the note The Religious Freedom
Restoration Act is fairly representative: \"Government shall not
