research sources online, "15 CFR § 742.7 - Crime control and detection."
<https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/15/742.7>) // WhtCbn

§ 742.7 Crime control and detection. (a)License requirements. In support
of U.S. foreign policy to promote the observance of human rights
throughout the world, a license is required to export and reexport crime
control and detection equipment, related technology and software as
follows: (1) Crime control and detection instruments and equipment and
related technology and software identified in the appropriate ECCNs on
the CCL under CC Column 1 in the Country Chart column of the "License
Requirements" section. A license is required to countries listed in CC
Column 1 (supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR). Items affected by
this requirement are identified on the CCL under the following ECCNs:
0A978, 0A979, 0A984, 0A987, 0E984, 1A984, 1A985, 3A980, 3A981, 3D980,
3E980, 4A003 (for fingerprint computers only), 4A980, 4D001 (for
fingerprint computers only), 4D980, 4E001 (for fingerprint computers
only), 4E980, 6A002 (for police-model infrared viewers only), 6E001 (for
police-model infrared viewers only), 6E002 (for police-model infrared
viewers only), and 9A980. (2) Shotguns with a barrel length greater than
or equal to 24 inches, identified in ECCN 0A984 on the CCL under CC
Column 2 in the Country Chart column of the "License Requirements"
section regardless of end-user to countries listed in CC Column 2
(supplement no. 1 part 738 of the EAR). (3) Shotguns with barrel length
greater than or equal to 24 inches, identified in ECCN 0A984 on the CCL
under CC Column 3 in the Country Chart column of the "License
Requirements" section only if for sale or resale to police or law
enforcement entities in countries listed in CC Column 3 (supplement no.
1 part 738 of the EAR). (4) Certain crime control items require a
license to all destinations, except Canada. These items are identified
under ECCNs 0A982, 0A985, and 0E982. Controls for these items appear in
each ECCN; a column specific to these controls does not appear in the
Country Chart (supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR). (5) Items
designed for the execution of human beings as identified in ECCN 0A981
require a license to all destinations including Canada. (6) See § 742.11
of the EAR for further information on items controlled under ECCN 0A983,
which require a license to all destinations, including Canada.
(b)Licensing policy. Applications for items controlled under this
section will generally be considered favorably on a case-by-case basis
unless there is civil disorder in the country or region or unless there
is evidence that the government of the importing country may have
violated internationally recognized human rights. The judicious use of
export controls is intended to deter the development of a consistent
pattern of human rights abuses, distance the United States from such
abuses and avoid contributing to civil disorder in a country or region.
(c)Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity date: August 22, 2000. Contract
sanctity applies only to items controlled under ECCNs 0A982, 0A985 and
0E982 destined for countries not listed in CC Column 1 of the Country
Chart (supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR). (d)U.S. controls. In
maintaining its controls on crime control and detection items, the
United States considers international norms regarding human rights and
the practices of other countries that control exports to promote the
observance of human rights. However, these controls are not based on the
decisions of any multinational export control regime and may differ from
controls imposed by other countries.

#### \*Contention One is the Torture Trade

#### It\'s illegal to own weapons but not produce them in the US -- that ensures thousands are subject to torture globally

**Elliott \'01** (Philip Elliott joins Scripps Howard Foundation Wire
from Ohio University, Athens, Ohio., 2-26-2001, \"Report: U.S. companies
top list in torture tool trade\", Scripps Howard Foundation Wire \|
News, Politics, Washington D.C.,
http://www.shfwire.com/report-us-companies-top-list-torture-tool-trade/)
\[HS\]

"**[The U.S. is a world leader in the torture trade, with devastating
and deadly consequences for tens of thousands of people]{.underline}**,"
said William F. Schulz, executive director of Amnesty International USA.
"[The torture weapons industry]{.underline} is one [where 'Made in the
USA']{.underline} [should be]{.underline} a badge [of
shame]{.underline}." [U.S. companies produced more than \$97 million in
"crime control equipment," including chains, leg irons, chemical
controls]{.underline} such as pepper spray, stun belts and stun guns
between 1997 and February 2000,according to U.S. Department of Commerce
documents included in the report. "No one should profit from torture,"
Schulz said. Amnesty International USA, an arm of the London-based human
rights organization, called the Bush administration to ban the use,
manufacture and trade of instruments of torture. "[In the absence of
stringent worldwide controls to prevent this ...,export should be
immediately halted]{.underline}," according to the report, Stopping the
Torture Trade. Amnesty International officials have not met with the
Bush administration yet to discuss the topic, but had met with the
Clinton administration, Schulz said. The organization's report did not
call for banning of tear gas or handcuffs, said author of the report,
Brian Wood. But those, too, lend themselves to abuse, he said. "There
cannot be a solution to this problem unless it's an international
solution," he said. [While traditional instruments of torture such as
leg irons and serrated thumb cuffs remain popular in the torturers'
arsenals, electroshock weapons are gaining clout]{.underline}, Schulz
said. "Amnesty International has found that the number of [companies
worldwide]{.underline} that [manufacture or supply high-tech weapons has
soared]{.underline} from 30 in the 1980s to more than 130 today," he
said. "The [manufacture of weapons like this is increasing because they
allow the torturer to do his dirty work without a trace]{.underline}."
[Electroshock techniques do not leave bruises]{.underline} associated
with clubbing or beating, he said. "We're not talking about cattle
prods," Wood said. Electroshock torture can pump up to 50,000 volts
through aerial barbs, remote-activated belts or batons, he said. The
shock goes to the nervous systems and circulatory system, causing the
victim to lose control of bodily functions. "[What began in the United
States has become a free-for-all,]{.underline}" Wood said. [The Commerce
Department granted the export licenses to countries in which the State
Department has documented torture and ill-treatment]{.underline}, Schulz
said. Russia, identified by the State Department as a violator of human
rights, purchased more than \$4 million in torture tools from U.S.
companies between 1997 and February 2000. Israel purchased more than \$2
million in the same period. [Mexico was the United State's top client of
torture paraphernalia, according to U.S. Department of
Commerce]{.underline} documents included in the report. [Mexico bought
more than \$15 million in tools from U.S. companies]{.underline} between
1997 and February 2000. [Sweden toped the list of Commerce
Department-approved destinations for an export classification that
includes optical sighting devices, stun guns and shock
baton]{.underline}s, according to the report. Between 1997 and February
2000,Sweden purchased almost \$9 million in electroshock. And
electroshock technology is banned in Sweden. "It is outrageous and
unacceptable that while owning these weapons [in our
nation]{.underline}'s capital [is unlawful]{.underline}, [it
is]{.underline} perfectly [legal for U.S. companies to manufacture,
supply and export weapons like this to countries where torture
occurs]{.underline}," Schulz said.

#### A United States unequivocal stance against the "torture trade" spills over

\[Peter **Maurer**, 12-17-20**14**, \"Rejecting Torture Is the Right
Thing to Do,\" HuffPost,
<https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rejecting-torture-is-the_b_6336926>\]
//WY

**[The fact of the matter is that torture is illegal]{.underline}**.
**[The prohibition of torture, and all forms of ill-treatment, is
absolute --- everywhere and at all times]{.underline}**. **[It is
strictly forbidden by international human rights law, U.S.
jurisprudence, the United Nations Convention against Torture, and the
Geneva Conventions]{.underline}** --- **[a body of law embraced by the
U.S.]{.underline}** and its military **[since the 19th
Century.]{.underline}** Importantly, **[torture is morally reprehensible
and it should be permanently repudiated by all nations]{.underline}**.
**[Torture and other forms of cruel or humiliating treatment are an
affront to humanity, and the physical and psychological scars can last a
lifetime. It is morally wrong because it dehumanizes the
victims]{.underline}**, the perpetrators, and the society that surrounds
them. **[Torture can destroy the social fabric of communities, degrade a
society's institutions, and undermine the integrity of its political
systems.]{.underline}** I know that no country on Earth is entirely
immune to what amounts to an ages-old temptation, and some people
reading this might think, "That's easy for you to say. Sometimes you
have to make tough choices in the name of national security." **[I would
argue that those who believe that perceived, near term tactical gains
are worth risking long term and potentially dangerous consequences, are
shortsighted]{.underline}**. Experience shows that the **[reliance on
illegal, immoral, and inhumane interrogation techniques is universally a
very poor choice]{.underline}**. The International Committee of the Red
Cross visits roughly half a million detainees in nearly 100 countries
each year. **[It's our job to try to prevent and put an end to torture
and ill-treatment.]{.underline}** During my time as president of the
ICRC, I have met in person with detainees, who have experienced
ill-treatment at the hands of their captors, and I know for a fact that
abuse only grows hatred. It sows the seeds of revenge, and nothing
justifies the use of such tactics. I have also observed that **[torture
has a corrupting effect on its perpetrators and the institutions they
serve.]{.underline}** Wherever it takes place and whatever the stakes
involved, it's simply wrong. In the wake of the September 11 terrorist
attacks, the ICRC actively engaged with the U.S. on issues related to
the treatment of detainees held in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo
Bay. Very early on, we decided to invest in a constructive and sustained
dialogue with the American authorities. Even when discussions were
sometimes tense over the past 12 years, the ICRC's commitment to the
detainees never wavered. We remain committed to visiting them,
monitoring their treatment, connecting them with their families, and
consistently reminding the U.S. of their obligations under international
humanitarian law. Today, our relationship with the government is strong.
**[The bottom line is that decisions taken in Washington resonate across
the globe]{.underline}**. **[The U.S. has a major influence on the world
stage and American]{.underline}** detention **[practices can, for better
or for worse, have an impact on the actions of officials]{.underline}**,
prison directors, guards, **[and interrogators in even the most
far-flung places on the planet. That's why this moment in history offers
an opportunity to reaffirm clearly]{.underline}**, and **[for the whole
world to hear, that torture and ill-treatment are fundamentally
wrong]{.underline}**, **[and that unconditionally rejecting such tactics
--- now and forever --- is the right thing to do.]{.underline}**

#### US is main contributor of the torture trade

Given the foregoing documentation it hardly needs to be added that in
the modern era the USA is by far the greatest practitioner of terrorism
in the world. Again space permits no more than a brief selection from
the many summary statements to this effect. '**[The US has rained death
and destruction on more people in more regions of the globe than any
other nation in the period since the Second World War]{.underline}** ...
it has employed its military forces in other countries over 70 times
since 1945, not counting innumerable instances of counter insurgency
operations by the CIA.' 45 '... the US state has long been using
terrorist networks, and carrying out acts of terror itself.' 46 The US
'... is the greatest source of terror on earth'.47 'The greatest source
of terrorism48 is the US itself and some of the Latin American
countries.' 49 '... the US is itself a leading terrorist state.' 50
'There are many terrorist states, but the United States is unusual in
that it is officially committed to internationa l terrorism, and on a
scale that puts its rivals to shame.' 51 'We are the target of
terrorists because in much of the world our government stands for
dictatorship, bondage, and human exploitation. ... We are the target of
terrorists because we are hated. ... And we are hated because our
governments have done hateful things. ... Time after time we have ousted
popular leaders who wanted the riches of the land to be shared by the
people who worked it. ... We are hated because our government denies
(democracy, freedom, human rights) to people in Third World countries
whose resources are coveted by our multinational corporations.' 52 'In
1998 Amnesty International released a report that made it clear that the
**[US was 'at least as responsible for extreme violation of human rights
around the globe as---including the promotion of torture]{.underline}**
and terrorism and state violence---as any government or organisation in
the world.' 53 'From any objective standpoint, Israel and the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[States more frequently rely on terrorism,
and in forms that inflict far greater quantums of suffering on their
victims than do their opponents.]{.underline}**' 54 That this has been
clearly understood for decades by critical students of American Foreign
Policy is evident in the following quotes from the late 1970s and early
1980s. '... the US and its allies have armed the elites of the Third
World to the teeth, and saturated them with counterinsurgency weaponry
and training. ... **[Hideous torture has become standard practice in US
client fascist states.]{.underline}** ... **[Much of the electronic and
other torture gear, is US supplied and great numbers of ...
interrogators are US trained]{.underline}** ...'.55 "**[Many of the
world's most brutal dictatorships "... are in place precisely because
they serve US interests in a joint venture with local torturers at the
expense of their majorities]{.underline}**".'56 **[After documenting
supply of aid to 23 countries guilty of 'human rights
abuses']{.underline}**, Trosan and Yates say, '**[Without US help they
would be hard pressed to contain the fury of their oppressed citizens
and US businesses would find it difficult to flourish']{.underline}**.
Whenever their people have rebelled and tried to seize power, thereby
threatening foreign investments, **[the USA has on every occasion
actively supported government repression and terror, or has promoted
coups to overthrow popular governments]{.underline}**.57

#### Torture inflicts physical and mental pain

**Goering \'17** (Curt Goering, CVT executive director, in Spokane,
Washington, on September 9, 2017., 9-12-2017, \"Why Torture is Wrong\",
Center for Victims of Torture,
https://www.cvt.org/blog/healing-and-human-rights/why-torture-wrong-0)
\[HS\]

We also know that [torture leaves deep and long-lasting
wounds]{.underline}. [Survivors]{.underline} who receive care at CVT
[endure chronic pain in muscles and joints, from being bound or hung or
confined]{.underline} to small spaces like cages. [They
have]{.underline} [balance and mobility issues]{.underline}, often [from
being beaten]{.underline} on the soles of the feet or lower legs. They
have a range of [sleep disorders]{.underline}, [from]{.underline}
sleeplessness to intense and [incessant nightmares in which the
torturers revisit them]{.underline} night after night after night. They
endure [deep depression]{.underline}, [severe anxiety]{.underline} and
frequent [thoughts of suicide]{.underline}. [Torture is psychological as
well as physical]{.underline}. [Torturers]{.underline} [often focus on
ways of inflicting grave pain]{.underline} that never leave a mark on
the flesh: [forced nakedness and sexual humiliation, stress positions,
sleep deprivation, sensory overload, sensory deprivation and mock
execution]{.underline}s are among some of the horrific methods used. One
of the reasons that this fact is important is that it is abused. When
people seek to justify torture, they often argue that if an act doesn't
leave scars, it is not torture. You hear this in connection with
waterboarding. But we know, and medical experts have proven, that [the
psychological effects of torture are as devastating and long-lasting as
physical effects]{.underline}. Indeed, [many survivors]{.underline} we
work with [say it's even worse]{.underline}. Trying to hide torture
behind euphemisms like "enhanced interrogation" is manipulation of the
facts. These [tactics are cruel and debilitating]{.underline}. James
Mitchell himself acknowledged that most [people would rather have their
legs broken than endure waterboarding]{.underline}. [Torture is used to
control communities]{.underline}. At CVT, we work with survivors of
torture committed by repressive regimes around the world. Many of our
clients were highly successful in their lives, in business, in
professional careers and in their communities. [When one person is taken
and tortured, the family learns immediately to be afraid, to be
silent]{.underline}. When a second person is tortured, [the
community]{.underline} quickly gets the message: you [must do whatever
the perpetrators want. Torture takes control]{.underline} swiftly.
[Torture creates]{.underline} such a climate of [fear and
insecurity]{.underline} that it fractures communities, silences dissent
and suppresses civic engagement[. It creates cultures based on apathy
and fear]{.underline}.

#### The CIA and other agencies fabricate the success of torture -- info they get rarely comes from torturing

[The CIA misled both Congress and the White House on the effectiveness
of its interrogation techniques In order to show]{.underline} the White
House, the National Security Council, the Department of Justice, the CIA
Office of Inspector General, Congress, and the public [that the
"enhanced" interrogation techniques were an effective means of obtaining
accurate information or gaining detainees cooperation]{.underline}, [the
CIA pointed to specific examples of terrorist plots that were "thwarted"
and specific terrorists who were captured. But the agency's
justifications were based on inaccurate claims]{.underline}. The [Senate
committee reviewed 20 examples of counterterrorism successes used by the
CIA and found all to be false in some respect]{.underline}. "In some
cases[, there was no relationship between the cited counterterrorism
success and any information provided by detainees]{.underline} during or
after the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques." In the
remaining cases, the CIA claimed erroneously that specific and otherwise
unavailable information was obtained from a detainee "as a result" of
CIA techniques, when [in reality the information was either a
corroboration of knowledge already known]{.underline} (meaning it was
not "otherwise unavailable") [or it was acquired from the detainee
before the enhanced interrogation methods were even used]{.underline}.
Plus, according to CIA records, seven of the the 39 detainees known to
have been subjected to these techniques produced no intelligence while
in custody. Multiple detainees fabricated information, giving the CIA
faulty intelligence. This fabricated information was represented as
critical intelligence to the CIA, and included terrorist threats that
the agency identified as its highest priorities. "[Some of the plots
that the CIA claimed to have 'disrupted' as a result of the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques were assessed by intelligence and law
enforcement officials as being infeasible or ideas that were never
operationalized]{.underline}," concluded the report. But in March 2008,
Bush vetoed the Intelligence Authorization Bill, which would have
effectively banned techniques like waterboarding by applying the
standards in the U.S. Army Field Manual to the entire government. The
president justified his decision in a radio broadcast, repeating CIA
claims that the interrogation program supplied intelligence that foiled
specific terrorist plots. And the House of Representatives failed to
override his veto. Early in his presidency, Barack Obama issued
executive order 13491, requiring that manual to be applied to the entire
government, banning the use of enhanced interrogation techniques.

#### Torture is an ineffective of gaining credible info on terrorist plots

Does Torture Work? [Experienced interrogators and intelligence experts
say]{.underline} that using [torture and abuse in interrogations is not
an effective way to elicit reliably truthful information]{.underline}.
According to a statement by 25 former interrogators and intelligence
professionals from the U.S. military and other federal agencies
(including the CIA, FBI, DEA, and NCIS), "[The application of
psychological, emotional, and/or physical pressure can force a victim of
torture to say anything just to end the painful experience]{.underline}.
The [challenge of interrogation is]{.underline} not 'to make people
talk'; instead, it is [to obtain precise and credible
information]{.underline}."[\[1\]](http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/resource/statement-national-security-intelligence-and-interrogation-professionals)
Neurological science also shows [that torture and abuse are ineffective
ways to interrogate prisoners]{.underline}. In fact, according to
neuroscience professor Shane O'Mara, [abusive interrogation
techniques]{.underline} (both physical and psychological) [can
"compromise memory, mood, and cognitive function," which are essential
to eliciting accurate
information]{.underline}.[\[2\]](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-interrogated-brain/201603/why-torture-doesnt-work)
Though torture advocates have touted the "successes" from the CIA using
abusive interrogation after 9/11, the [Senate intelligence
committee]{.underline} report on CIA interrogation and detention [shows
that the tactics were much less effective than the CIA
claimed]{.underline}, [and did not result in unique information that
stopped attacks and saved
lives]{.underline}.[\[3\]](http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/uploads/pdfs/torture/sscistudy1.pdf#page=9)
Terrorist Groups use Torture. Why Shouldn\'t the United States? Humane
treatment of prisoners and detainees is a fundamental part of American
ideals and values. [Abandoning these values to sink to the level of
terrorist groups would diminish U.S. standing in the world, and reduce
American influence on human rights, military, and counterterrorism
issues]{.underline}. As 42 retired Generals and Admirals wrote,
"[Torture violates our core values as a nation. Our greatest strength is
our commitment to the rule of law]{.underline} and to the principles
embedded in our Constitution. Our servicemen and women need to know that
our leaders do not condone torture of any
kind."[\[4\]](http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/resource/letter-retired-military-leaders-presidential-candidates)
[Torture provides no strategic advantage, and abuses by the United
States provide enemies with a rallying point around which to recruit new
followers]{.underline}. During the Iraq War, the [primary reason for
foreign fighters to come fight U.S. troops was the "perceived U.S.
abuses of and lack of due process for detainees at Abu Ghraib and
Guantanamo
Bay]{.underline}."[\[5\]](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06KUWAIT913_a.html)
Shouldn't we do anything to stop terrorist attacks, including using
torture? As noted above, effective interrogation does not involve
torture or abuse. [Getting accurate information from detainees is the
most certain way to disrupt plots and stop attacks]{.underline}. The
often-cited "ticking time bomb" situation is no exception, and resorting
to torture in these cases causes "the abuse \[to\] spread like wildfire,
and every captured prisoner \[becomes\] the key to defusing a potential
ticking time bomb ... the rare exception fast becoming the rule,"
according to former U.S. Marine Corps Commandant General Charles C.
Krulak and former U.S. CENTCOM Commander General Joseph P.
Hoar.[\[6\]](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/16/AR2007051602395.html)

Restraints [Body worn electric shock equipment, often referred to as

pain]{.underline} [or,]{.underline} if activated, to enforce [compliance
through pain]{.underline}. [Their use has been]{.underline}
internationally [condemned by U]{.underline}nited [N]{.underline}ations

Commission has imposed an import and export ban on this equipment under

**[hav]{.underline}**ing **["no practical use other than]{.underline}**
for the purpose of **[torture]{.underline}** and other cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment or punishment"; thus enabling a de facto EU-wide ban
on their use. [Omega recommends]{.underline} a complete prohibition on
the transfer to LEAs of body worn electric shock equipment. Furthermore
**[that the US take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or
other measures to prevent the manufacture, trade, and use of body worn

**[Perhaps the first response one might make to the above arguments is
to meet utilitarian considerations with deontological
ones]{.underline}**. **[Rather than accepting that torture is like an
economic transaction]{.underline}**, where we trade one life for many
others, **[one might emphasize a position typically associated with
Kant: namely]{.underline}**, **[the view that the respect of a given
individual is inviolable]{.underline}**, **[and is not the sort of thing
that has a \"price.\"]{.underline}** **[Objects can be traded according
to equivalences; human beings, however, cannot]{.underline}**. **[The
problem with the ticking-bomb argument]{.underline}**, every Kantian
will insist, **[lies with the model of torture]{.underline}** (and of
ethical thinking and agency) **[that it presupposes]{.underline}**.
**[The numbers game ignores the individual dignity and autonomy of the
agents subject to its analysis]{.underline}**. Although there are
powerful arguments against the economic model of ethical analysis, and
hence of a defense of torture along economic lines, it is important in
the current con-text to see if the argument above works given economic
assump-tions. **[If the argument can be shown to be lacking even when we
reason within economic parameters]{.underline}** (with the conception of
torture as mere transaction)**[, its rejection will prove all the more
decisive.]{.underline}** Thus, despite our own predilection to accept
the Kantian conception of the person, to combat the ticking-bomb
argument requires thinking about torture on the economic model that is
the basis of the argument, at least if we prefer to avoid a stand-off of
moral intuitions. Artificial Cases Objection **[The other immediate
response often offered by those confronted with the ticking-bomb
argument typically involves pointing out how deeply artificial the case
is.]{.underline}** This objection is forcefully raised in Henry Shue\'s
classic paper, \"Torture\"9: **[There is a saying in jurisprudence that
hard cases make bad law]{.underline}**, **[and there might well be one
in philosophy that artificial cases make bad ethics]{.underline}** . . .
**[Notice how unlike the circum-stances of an actual choice about
torture the philosopher\'s example]{.underline}** ix The proposed victim
of our torture is not someone we suspect of planting the device: he is
the perpetrator. He is not some pitiful psychotic making one last play
for attention: he did plant the device. The wiring is not backwards, the
mechanism is not jammed: the device will destroy the city if not
deactivated. (142) As Shue makes clear**[, the ticking-bomb case is
practically beyond belief.]{.underline}** In addition to the above
problems, we must also know how to torture the perpetrator, that torture
will be effective, that it will not take more time than is available,
and so on**[. But the artificiality of the ticking-bomb case is in fact
worse than any of this suggests: if we know that the bomb is wired
cor-rectly, and that this perpetrator is guilty of placing this bomb
where it is, we must have acquired this knowledge in some
way]{.underline}**. **[How could we have the knowledge in question---a
certainty that makes torture permissible]{.underline}**---unless we saw
the bomb being wired, and then saw this perpetrator place it? If we have
seen these sure on agents along with sleep deprivation and other
tactics, but that we cannot inflict harsh physical pain on such agents,
we (perhaps inadvertently) legitimate the use of all and any tech-niques
that are perhaps just below the level of torture. If it is considered
torture to keep someone awake for 20 hours, and hence is regarded as
illegitimate, this position might lead persons to subject others to 19
hours and 59 minutes of sleep depriva-tion. **[The thought here is that
establishing actual policies will show persons where the line is, so
that they can approach it more frequently with impunity.°]{.underline}**

#### The justification for torture is created by representational politics that dehumanizes the "other" in order to justify foreign interventionism and the prison industrial complex

**Mertus and Rawls** **'08** \-- associate professor and co-director of
the MA program in ethics, peace and global affairs @ American U.,
graduate student in philosophy at Pennsylvania State University(Julie
and Kristin, "Crossing the Line: Insights from Foucault on the United
States and Torture,
https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9780230612792_2//JC)

Ever since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. government has
argued that the extraordinary nature of terrorism1 requires
extraordinary responses that, in gentler days, would have been rejected
as illegal and immoral. **[Under a crude utilitarian
calculus]{.underline}**, **[U.S. officials have contended
that]{.underline}** because **[Americans live in such
dangerous]{.underline}** **[and frightening times]{.underline}**, **[the
suspension of civil liberties]{.underline}**---**[including the right to
be free from torture]{.underline}**--- **[may be
justified]{.underline}** (Human Rights Watch 2006; also BBC News 2006).
**[The trajectory toward the mainstreaming of torture in U.S. policy has
been swift and reactionary]{.underline}**. Immediately after September
11, the George W. Bush administration secretly approved measures for
interrogating suspected al-Qaeda operatives that were to stop just short
of torture (Kelley 2004, 1A). **[Thus began the slippery slope toward
the normalization of torture]{.underline}**. By 2003, reports on the
torture of U.S.-held war prisoners were surfacing,2 and the "Bush
administration lawyers \[were contending\] . . . that the President
wasn't bound by laws prohibiting torture and that government agents who
might torture prisoners at his direction couldn't be prosecuted by the
Justice Department" (Bravin 2004). The lawyers reasoned that the Geneva
Conventions outlining the proper treatment of enemy prisoners did not
pertain to inmates held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, who were designated as
"enemy combatants," and thus the door was open for torture (Ross 2005).
**[Torture]{.underline}** "American style" **[happens]{.underline}**
within the confines of prisons (originally conceived in lieu of torture)
(Ross 2005, 119), **[under great secrecy, and without the public
spectacle]{.underline}** of earlier times where the actual body of the
accused was grotesquely attacked, delimbed, and disemboweled before the
masses. Torture today is an entirely different kind of spectacle. **[Its
existence is widely known by political elites,]{.underline}** **[but is
ignored under utilitarian reasoning]{.underline}** (as justified means
to the ends of containing terrorism) and is leaked to the general public
through a series of photographic images that are disseminated through
the Internet and other world media outlets, where they are widely
debated and discussed, although no action is ever taken and the torture
and violence continue. These new **[images of torture]{.underline}**
serve a clear political purpose, as they are closely connected to
discourse on the "war on terrorism." As Richard Jackson observes, the
language and images of the "war on terrorism \[are\] not simply a
neutral refl ction of reality." Rather, they **[are "a carefully
constructed discourse that is designed to achieve a certain number of
key political goals, to normalize and legitimize the]{.underline}**
current counter-terrorist approach \[which employs torture\], to empower
**[authorities and protect them from criticism]{.underline}**; **[to
discipline domestic society by marginalizing dissent or protest; and to
enforce national identity by reifying a narrow conception of national
identity]{.underline}**" (2005, 2). A torture image folded into this
terrorist discourse becomes itself an exercise of power. **[Today's
torture chambers illustrate an extreme perversion in the mechanism of
power institutionalized in the prison system, in the name of the
American people and against a specific type of dehumanized
"other]{.underline}**." **[Described variously as animals, evildoers,
parasites, and cancers and other diseases and scourges against humanity,
the less-than-human accused terrorists can be subject to less-than-human
torture]{.underline}**. This chapter uses two frameworks developed by
Michel Foucault---one related to the nature of prisons and one related
to that of madness---in order to argue **[that this perversion is made
possible precisely as a result of the politicization of discipline and
punishment and the construction of the enemy other]{.underline}**.

#### This dehumanization creates the kill-to-save mentality that risks the destruction of all

**Santos 03.** 2003, Boaventura de Souza Santos is a Professor of
Sociology at the University of Coimbra, "Collective Suicide?", Bad
Subjects, Issue \# 63 ,http://www.ces.fe.uc.pt/opiniao/bss/072en.php

**[According to]{.underline}** Franz **[Hinkelammert]{.underline}**,
**[the West has]{.underline}** repeatedly **[been under the illusion
that it should try to save humanity by destroying part of it. This is a
salvific and sacrificial destruction, committed in the name of the need
to radically materialize all the possibilities opened up by a given
social and political reality over which it is supposed to have total
power. This is how it was in colonialism, with the genocide of
indigenous peoples, and the African slaves. This is how it was in the
period of imperialist struggles, which caused millions of deaths in two
world wars and many other colonial wars. This is how it was in
Stalinism, with the Gulag and in Nazism, with the
holocaust]{.underline}**. And now today, **[this is how it is in
neoliberalism, with the collective sacrifice of the periphery and even
the semiperiphery of the world system.]{.underline}** With the war
against Iraq, it is fitting to ask whether what is in progress is a new
genocidal and sacrificial illusion, and what its scope might be. **[It
is above all appropriate to ask if the new illusion will not herald the
radicalization and the ultimate perversion of the western
illusion]{.underline}**: **[destroying all of humanity in the illusion
of saving it.]{.underline}** **[Sacrificial genocide arises from a
totalitarian illusion that is manifested in the belief that there are no
alternatives to the present-day reality and that the problems and
difficulties confronting it arise from failing to take its logic of
development to its ultimate consequences.]{.underline}** **[If there is
unemployment, hunger and death in the Third World, this is not the
result of market failures]{.underline}**; instead, **[it is the outcome
of the market laws not having been fully applied.]{.underline}** **[If
there is terrorism]{.underline}**, **[this is not due to the violence of
the conditions that generate it; it is due, rather, to the fact that
total violence has not been employed to physically eradicate all
terrorists and potential terrorists.]{.underline}** **[This political
logic is based on the supposition of total power and
knowledge]{.underline}**, **[and on the radical rejection of
alternatives]{.underline}**; **[it is ultra-conservative in that it aims
to infinitely reproduce the status quo.]{.underline}** Inherent to it is
the notion of the end of history. During the last hundred years, **[the
West has experienced three versions of this logic]{.underline}**, and,
therefore, seen three versions of the end of history:
**[Stalinism]{.underline}**, with its logic of insuperable efficiency of
the plan; **[Nazism]{.underline}**, with its logic of racial
superiority; **[and neoliberalism]{.underline}**, with its logic of
insuperable efficiency of the market. The first two periods involved the
destruction of democracy. The last one trivializes democracy, disarming
it in the face of social actors sufficiently powerful to be able to
privatize the State and international institutions in their favour. I
have described this situation as a combination of political democracy
and social fascism. One current manifestation of this combination
resides in the fact that intensely strong public opinion, worldwide,
against the war is found to be incapable of halting the war machine set
in motion by supposedly democratic rulers. **[At all these
moments]{.underline}**, **[a death drive, a catastrophic
heroism]{.underline}**, **[predominates, the idea of a looming
collective suicide, only preventable by the massive destruction of the
other.]{.underline}** Paradoxically, **[the broader the definition of
the other and the efficacy of its destruction, the more likely
collective suicide becomes. In its sacrificial genocide version,
neoliberalism is a mixture of market radicalization, neoconservatism and
Christian fundamentalism.]{.underline}** **[Its death drive takes a
number of forms, from the idea of \"discardable
populations\"]{.underline}**, **[referring to citizens of the Third
World not capable of being exploited as workers and consumers, to the
concept of \"collateral damage\", to refer to the deaths, as a result of
war, of thousands of innocent civilians]{.underline}**. The last,
catastrophic heroism, is quite clear on two facts: according to reliable
calculations by the Non-Governmental Organization MEDACT, in London,
between 48 and 260 thousand civilians will die during the war and in the
three months after (this is without there being civil war or a nuclear
attack); the war will cost 100 billion dollars, enough to pay the health
costs of the world\'s poorest countries for four years. **[Is it
possible to fight this death drive?]{.underline}** We must bear in mind
that, historically, **[sacrificial destruction has always been linked to
the economic pillage of natural resources and the labor force, to the
imperial design of radically changing the terms of economic, social,
political and cultural exchanges in the face of falling efficiency rates
postulated by the maximalist logic of the totalitarian illusion in
operation.]{.underline}** It **[is as though hegemonic
powers]{.underline}**, **[both when they are on the rise and when they
are in decline, repeatedly go through times of primitive accumulation,
legitimizing the most shameful violence in the name of futures
where]{.underline}**, by definition, **[there is no room for what must
be destroyed]{.underline}**. In today\'s version, the **[period of
primitive accumulation consists of combining neoliberal economic
globalization with the globalization of war. The machine of democracy
and liberty turns into a machine of horror and
destruction.]{.underline}**

#### The United States has an ethical obligation to end complicity with torture

legal officer at REDRESS, \"Cooperating with the enemy of mankind: can
states simply turn a blind eye to torture?,\" Taylor & Francis,

//WY

**[Just as the convention requires more vigilance of states when it
comes to torture, so too do the general rules on state responsibility.
While the rules on the 'complicity' of states]{.underline}** set out in
article 16 of the Articles on State Responsibility **[may be tightly
circumscribed by relatively high hurdles of causation and intent so as
not to jeopardise legitimate international cooperation, the ILC
recognised that -- when it comes to systematic breaches of peremptory
norms of international law -- different considerations are at
play.]{.underline}** The articles therefore provide two separate rules
recognising that such breaches can 'attract additional consequences, not
only for the responsible State but for all other States'.104 ILC,
'Articles on State Responsibility', 112. View all notes **[The
applicability of these special rules is defined by article 40 as
relating to a 'serious breach' of an 'obligation arising under a
peremptory norm of general international law'. The commentaries make it
clear that the prohibition of torture is considered a peremptory norm of
international law falling within these provisions]{.underline}**.105
Ibid., 113. A breach is considered 'serious' if it involves a 'gross or
systematic failure by the responsible State to fulfil the
obligation'.106 Articles on State Responsibility, article 40(2). **[The
commentaries provide that: '\[t\]o be regarded as systematic, a
violation would have to be carried out in an organized and deliberate
way.]{.underline}** In contrast, the term "gross" refers to the
intensity of the violation or its effects' (at page 113). Article 41(1)
recognises that, **[where there is such a serious breach of an
obligation arising under international law, 'States shall cooperate to
bring to an end through lawful means' any such breach.]{.underline}**
Article 41(2) provides additionally that '**[No State shall recognize as
lawful a situation created by a serious breach...nor render aid or
assistance in maintaining that situation.' The obligation set out under
Article 41(2) is a customary international law
obligation]{.underline}**, as recognised by the ICJ in the Namibia and
Palestinian Wall cases, arising from the 'character and the importance
of the rights and obligations involved'.107 Legal Consequences for
States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia, ICJ Reports
1971 16, para. 117 (1970); Legal Consequences of the Construction of a
Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Advisory Opinion, ICJ
Reports 2004 136, para. 159 (2004). View all notes The status of the
obligation in article 41(1) to cooperate to bring an end to a violation
of a jus cogens norm is still developing.108 The commentaries note that
it may be open to question whether general international law at present
prescribes a positive duty of cooperation and observes that article
41(1) in that respect may reflect the progressive development of
international law (at page 114). View all notes However, the fact that
special rules have been recognised for this category of obligation is
significant for an understanding of the wrongfulness or otherwise of
states systematically receiving and relying on information known or
suspected to have been obtained by torture. In such cases, the threshold
for international responsibility can be seen to have been lowered based
on the importance of the values at stake. **[Third basis: states have a
primary obligation to refrain from action which exposes people to a risk
of torture, wherever it occurs A third potential basis for a more
stringent approach arises not from ideas of complicity in another\'s
act, but rather from a primary obligation on states, inherent in the
prohibition of torture itself, to refrain from action which exposes a
person to a serious risk of torture]{.underline}**.109 This principle is
shown clearly in the rule prohibiting the transfer of persons from one
state to another where there is a real risk that they will be subject to
torture, known as the non-refoulement obligation.110 For a general
overview see Cordula Droege, 'Transfers of Detainees: Legal Framework,
Non-refoulement and Contemporary Challenges', International Review of
the Red Cross 90 (2008): 670--6. **[This rule is found explicitly in
article 3 of the Convention against Torture, and has been read in to
other human rights treaties]{.underline}**, even where not specifically
referred to.111 Importantly, the obligation is seen not to arise from
the state\'s obligation to prevent torture (which could arguably be
limited territorially112 See, for example, Milanović, Extraterritorial
Application, 209--10. View all notes ), but directly from the
prohibition of torture itself.113 Soering, para. 91. Report of the
Special Rapporteur on Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading
Treatment or Punishment, UN Doc. A/59/324 (2004), para. 28: '\[t\]he
principle of non-refoulement is an inherent part of the overall absolute
and imperative nature of the prohibition of torture and other forms of
ill-treatment'. View all notes **[The principle is distinct from the
concept of derivative responsibility for complicity in another\'s
wrongful act]{.underline}**, because the liability does not arise as a
result of torture actually being carried out. **[Rather, to the extent
that liability is or may be incurred, 'it is liability incurred by the
extraditing...State by reason of its having taken action which has as a
direct consequence the exposure of an individual to proscribed
ill-treatment'.]{.underline}**114 Soering, para. 91. See also Aust,
Complicity, 396. Compare with the Court of Appeal\'s objection in the
Ahmed case that the 'wider concepts of complicity' could lead to a
situation where complicity in torture could be found even where the
torture had not taken place (at para. 46). View all notes **[Given its
basis in the prohibition of torture itself, it has been argued that the
non-refoulement obligation is a specific manifestation of a more general
principle that states must ensure that their actions]{.underline}**
(whether by extradition or otherwise**[) do not expose a person to a
substantial risk of torture anywhere in the world.]{.underline}**115

#### Conditioning ethical prescriptions produce disinterested subjects that uphold imperialism

Interview with William V. **Spanos '11**, SUNY Binghamton, \*modified
for ableist language

All that I\'ve just said should suggest what I meant when, long ago, in
response to someone in the debate world who seemed puzzled by the strong
reservations I expressed on being informed that the debate community in
the U.S. was appropriating my work on Heidegger, higher education, and
American imperialism. I said then \-- and I repeat here to you \-- that
the traditional form of the debate, that is, the hegemonic frame that
rigidly determines its protocols\-- is unworldly in an ideological way.
It willfully separates the debaters from the world as it actually is\--
by which I mean as it has been produced by the dominant democratic I
capitalist culture \--and it displaces them to a free-floating zone, a
no place, as it were, where all things, nor matter how different the
authority they command in the real world, are equal. **[But [in \*this\*
real world]{.mark} produced by the combination of Protestant
Christianity and [democratic capitalism things]{.mark} \-- and therefore
their value \--[are never equal]{.mark}. They are [framed into a system
of binaries-Identity/ difference]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
Civilization/barbarism I Men/woman, Whites/blacks, Sedentary/ nomadic,
Occidental/ oriental, Chosen I preterit (passed over), Self-reliance I
dependent (communal), Democracy I communism, Protestant Christian I
Muslim, and so on \-- in which the first term is not only privileged
over the second term, but, in thus being privileged, is also empowered
to demonize the second. **[Insofar as the [debate]{.mark} world [frames
argument as if every position has equal authority]{.mark} ([the debater
can take either side]{.mark}) [it obscures]{.mark} and eventually
effaces [awareness of the]{.mark} degrading imbalance of power in the
real world and the terrible [injustices it
perpetrates]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Thus framed, debate gives the false
impression that it is a truly democratic institution, whereas in reality
it is complicitous with the dehumanized and dehumanizing system of power
that produced it. **[It is no accident, in my mind, that [this
fraudulent form]{.mark} of debate [goes back to the founding of the U.S.
as a capitalist republic]{.mark} and that it has produced what I call
the \"political class\" to indicate not only the basic sameness between
the Democratic and Republican parties but also [its fundamental
indifference to]{.mark} the plight of [those who don\'t count]{.mark} in
a system where what counts is determined by those who are the heirs of
this quantitative system of binaries]{.underline}**.

Ocean and Japanese **[tsunamis]{.underline}**, Cyclone Nargis, **[the
war in Iraq,]{.underline}** **[genocide in the Sudan]{.underline}**, and
three **[brutal wars in Palestine and Lebanon]{.underline}**. **[The
picture beyond that does not improve when we add global stalemate on
climate change, mass slaughter in the Congo, Islamist terrorism in
Pakistan and India,]{.underline}** a craze for walls and "**[border
protection", and strategic anxiety about Iran, North Korea, the rise of
China,]{.underline}** **[and a future of drone, cyber and space
war]{.underline}**. All of **[these examples have been riven with moral
anxiety and exemplifi ed particular ethical choices]{.underline}**:
whether to use poison gas against enemy forces to protect one's own;
whether to bomb populated areas to shorten a war or degrade an enemy's
industrial capacity; whether to develop and deploy weapons that can
destroy cities in a few seconds and kill millions; whether to use
starvation as a weapon of war; whether to support Islamic extremists in
a proxy war in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union, in the face of
warnings about how they were likely to turn on their masters afterwards;
and when that time came, whether to fi ght such extremists by systemic
violations of the international laws of war and human rights. **[The
debates over these issues refl ec]{.underline}**t many things: their
inherent moral complexity, competing ethics and norms, and a global
interest in their rightness and long-term impact. None of these ethical
questions and dilemmas are new, but the fi eld of security studies has
been slow to address them, and it has not established a tradition of
ethical thought (Burke 2010; for new research see Floyd 2007; Hayden
2005; Robinson 2011; Roe 2012). This book attempts to address that gap,
and to contribute to a dialogue about the possibilities for a genuinely
global security orientation and practice in international politics. We
survey a range of ethical perspectives and arguments relating to diverse
problems on the global security agenda, so that we can begin to
understand how **[ethical commitments shape security relationships and
outcomes]{.underline}**: how poor or **[compromised
ethics]{.underline}** **[can contribute to insecurity]{.underline}**;
and how **[good ethical arguments]{.underline}** and decisions **[might
be able to improve the situation]{.underline}**. While examining
elements of existing ethical perspectives (such as realism, liberalism
and just war theory), **[we]{.underline}** push on to **[argue for
a]{.underline}** specifi cally **[cosmopolitan ethics]{.underline}**.
**[[A cosmopolitan ethics aims to ensure]{.mark} [the security of all
states]{.mark} and communities through time]{.underline}**,
[**[by]{.underline}** **[aiming for the elimination rather than just the
management of]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[grave
[insecurities]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[We regard such an ethics
as]{.mark} not merely [morally desirable]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[but]{.underline}** as **[[strategically
necessary]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and with this objective, **[we develop
ethical guidelines for the decisions and policies of all security
actors]{.underline}**. We list these principles here in Box 1.1 below,
and explain them in the section entitled 'Key Principles of a
Cosmopolitan Security Ethics'. If practices of global security politics
raise ethical questions at the conceptual level, they have also
precipitated broader debate and contestation in the "real world" of
international security. The Burmese military's refusal to allow foreign
aid to enter the country after the 2008 cyclone, which killed 140,000,
provoked global outrage, calls for foreign intervention, and active
regional diplomacy (Evans 2008b; Kouchner 2008). After the 2004 Indian
Ocean tsunami, which killed more than 280,000, the United Nations and
ASEAN moved to create an early warning system and response capability in
recognition of the failure to have such a system in place beforehand or
to even put such threats on the region's security agenda (Burke and
McDonald 2007: 1). Some of the scientists who built the fi rst atomic
bombs questioned their use in warfare and opposed the later development
of fusion weapons, while scores of former national security policymakers
have supported calls for total nuclear disarmament (Bird 2005: 426;
Burke 2009; Oppenheimer 1984: 113; Schweber 2000). The 2011 tsunami and
nuclear accident at Fukushima led many Japanese (and four European
countries) to question the role of nuclear power in their energy supply,
and brought calls for stronger global regulation of the industry
(Fackler 2012). The widespread bombing and targeting of civilians in war
have provoked major innovations in International Humanitarian Law (IHL),
including the classifi cation of area bombing and rape as war crimes,
and new treaties outlawing land mines and cluster weapons. The
International Criminal Court (ICC) was established to prosecute major
international crimes including war crimes, crimes against humanity,
genocide, and aggression. Aggression has been defi ned in such a way
('the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial
integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other
manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations') that it
would have put the US, Britain and Australia in the dock had it been in
force at the time of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 (Amendments to the
Rome Statute 2010). The moral anxiety and debate in such cases---just a
few of many---suggests something important. **[[Ethics
matters]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In this book, we contend that **[the
nature of global [insecurity]{.mark} in the last century, and the kinds
of security that the world will be able to achieve in this century,
[depends significantly on ethics]{.mark}:]{.underline}** on the ethics
we bring to our analysis, policymaking and decisions; on the ethics that
underpins our understanding of what security is and to whom it is owed;
and on the ethics that shapes the realities we accept or deny.
**[[Whether people]{.mark} [live or die,]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[]{.mark}whether they **[suffer or prosper]{.underline}**---**[which
people live and prosper]{.underline}** and where they are able to do
so--- are ethical questions. **[How these questions are
answered]{.underline}** in the real world **[[will be the results of
particular]{.mark} [ethical frameworks]{.mark}]{.underline}**, rules
**[and decisions]{.underline}**; the result of the ways in which ethical
dilemmas are posed, and how they are addressed and resolved. **[Is it
right to attack]{.underline}**---or target---**[cities with nuclear
weapo]{.underline}**ns? Is it right to even possess them? Is it right to
detain asylum seekers, push their boats out to sea, or return them to
the places from which they fl ed? Is it right to target terrorists and
insurgents with remote-controlled robotic aircraft and missiles, even if
those killed include civilians and if their operators aim---and
kill---without risk? Is it right to invade a foreign country to stop
crimes against humanity, end a famine, build a state, or remove a
regime, and if so, what are the right ways of going about it? Is it
right to use torture, or suspend habeas corpus or the rule of law, to
protect our security? What forms of reasoning, **[what criteria and
ends, should govern such decisions?]{.underline}** These are some of
what most of us recognise as "moral" questions central to war and
security---questions about killing, harm and humanity---and put in this
form they are certainly of great importance. In particular, such
questions are addressed in great depth in the "just war" tradition, and
you will read more about that school of thought in the pages that
follow. However, in this book we argue that the infl uence and problem
of ethics in security goes beyond moral choices in particular cases, and
beyond questions of war and violence, to take in the very system and
infrastructure of global security itself. This "system" is a dynamic and
contested set of processes that develops out of the frameworks provided
by (and actions of) key structures and actors: international treaties
and law, regional and global organisations, governments, militaries,
intelligence and aid agencies, NGOs, corporations, communities, and
civil society organisations. The "international" management of security,
however, should not be confused with a genuinely global sensibility,
perspective, practice or set of institutions. Currently, **[we have a
largely state-centric international security system that attempts very
imperfectly to deal with increasingly global processes and dynamics of
insecurity]{.underline}**: risks and threats that have transnational and
often global sources and symptoms. **[This system is structured around a
cooperative tensi]{.underline}**on (and sometimes outright confl ict)
between national security policies and military alliances, regional
security organisations (like ASEAN or the OSCE) and collective security
"regimes" of international law, treaty agreements and international
organisations in areas like arms control, disarmament, and the
environment. **[These regimes refl ect both cosmopolitan commitments to
deal with global problems in an eff ective and equitable way, and an
uglier [power politics]{.mark} that [generate]{.mark}s [compromises that
reflect]{.mark} particular [national]{.mark} and corporate ([rather than
global]{.mark}) [interests]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Such regimes are also
almost entirely missing or stagnant in areas like the energy and the
world economy. **[A global approach to security thus recognises that our
common problems are global in scope and that national, regional and
collective security responses need to be reformed to serve genuinely
global ends]{.underline}** (Burke 2013a). In our view, **[[the kind of
global security system we have, how and to whom it provides security, is
the]{.mark} very [first]{.mark} ethical
[question]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Does this system serve the interests
of states and corporations alone or the interests of all people and the
ecosystems that they depend on? **[Does it serve the interests of the
wealthy and powerful, or the poor and the marginalised]{.underline}**?
Does it serve the interests of some at an unacceptable cost to others?
These concerns preoccupied a "high level panel" of former states-people
asked by then United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan to map out a
new global security agenda in 2004. In their report, A More Secure
World, they said: Diff erences of power, wealth and geography do
determine what we perceive as the gravest threats to our survival and
well-being. **[[Differences of focus lead us to dismiss what others
perceive as the gravest of all threats to their
survival]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Inequitable responses to threats
further fuel division]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Many people believe that
what passes for collective security today is simply a system for
protecting the rich and powerful. (United Nations 2004: 2) We believe
that "ethics" and "morality" are not things that can be brought to
insecurity or war from outside, to a space that would otherwise be
unethical or amoral. Rather, we believe that even
**[before]{.underline}** **[we face a specific moral
decision]{.underline}**, **[ethics constitutes the choices available to
us]{.underline}**---**[that particular ethical
commitments]{.underline}**, **[options]{.underline}**,
**[limits]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[imperatives]{.underline}** **[are implicit in the system
itself,]{.underline}** and **[in]{.underline}** particular theoretical
and **[policy world views.]{.underline}** Every vision, every practice,
and every system of security has an ethics---even if we cannot agree
that all are equally ethical. As Richard Shapcott argues, **[any work of
political ethics must draw attention to the possible consequences or
implications of different starting points]{.underline}**...**[it is only
once we have assessed or understood these
\[consequences\]]{.underline}** **[that we can reflect adequately upon
our ethics and whether we think the costs of our positions are worth
it,]{.underline}** or not, or whether they are justifi able or need
modifi cation. (Shapcott 2010: vii-viiii) In sum, even as we accept that
to be able to term a perspective or behaviour "amoral", "immoral", or
"unethical" is a powerful and sometimes legitimate use of language,
**[it is analytically more helpful to be able to lay out the assumptions
and commitments of a range of ethical frameworks that bear on the
problems and realities of global security, so that their eff ects can be
considered and judged.]{.underline}** Even as we assume a responsibility
to advance a distinctive global security ethics that is better---that
will lead to a more just and stable world---we do so in a global
political context where moral pluralism is a fact. **[Debate among
competing ethical perspectives is necessary and
important.]{.underline}** Following Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics,
we see ethics not merely as right or moral behaviour, but as a vision of
the good---the 'highest good', an end towards which 'every action and
decision seems to aim' (Aristotle 2012: 216). This distinguishes our
approach from the "just war" tradition, which is the closest thing we
currently have to an ethics that addresses (some) security questions,
like war, terrorism and intervention. The end of the just war tradition
seems unduly modest, being merely to reduce the evils of an institution
(war) that it otherwise sees as an enduring social fact (Walzer 2006).
Our interest is larger: to understand and judge war and violence within
a more general global picture---and ethics---of security. When ethics is
understood in terms of an overarching vision of the social or political
good, moral conduct and decision-making will then be framed so as to
contribute to the desired end, and will be shaped by the ways in which
that good is defi ned and understood. What that ultimate end is becomes
crucial, because so much fl ows from it. Indeed, defi ning the ultimate
good not only drives ethics, but is an ethical problem in itself,
because settling on the overarching end of ethics involves making
decisions about what the world is (or ought to be) like, who matters,
what their needs are, who has responsibility, what those
responsibilities are, and how to discharge them. It shapes the realities
we can see or attempt to create. We also focus on ethics because of an
important practical distinction between "ethics" and "morality". It is
often said that morality relates to conduct whereas ethics relates to a
broader good towards which moral conduct will lead. It also seems that
when morality is invoked in international aff airs it is used
negatively, to resolve a problem where it may be necessary to do harm or
have truck with evil--- to decide when killing may be legitimate or
necessary, how much killing, for how long, and at a cost that does not
exceed the good we may be trying to do by way of it. Morality here is
about St Thomas Aquinas's "double eff ect".
**[[Ethics]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in contrast, **[[opens up a]{.mark}
more [positive trajectory]{.mark}: [to think of more systemic visions of
peace]{.mark}, justice and human fl ourishing [that might eliminate the
need]{.mark} [to resort to violence]{.mark}.]{.underline}** At the same
time, we acknowledge that grand ethical or moral visions can be
dangerous, if they legitimate unjust practices or blind us to
destructive consequences. And we accept the need for constant refl
ection on and interrogation of our ethical commitments and their
implications in practice. Even if in this book we accept the (contested)
claim that the highest good---the end---of ethics is "security", there
is a range of diverse and confl icting perspectives on what these ends
are. (Our view, as we explain below, is that the best way to understand
security as a highest good is in a global or cosmopolitan way.) The most
infl uential perspective, as discussed in Chapter 1, is associated with
the theory of **[[realism]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the majority of [state
practices]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It **[[holds that national]{.mark}
[security is the ultimate end]{.mark},]{.underline}** **[and [the
security of individuals]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[[ecosystems]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[or the world in general [is
invisible]{.mark} or is at least subordinate.]{.underline}** Some
classical realists also profess a concern to stabilise a structurally
unalterable system of state confl ict, so as to reduce the incidence and
severity of war and seek mutual security. **[[The national security
perspective views]{.mark} the security of [one's own state's citizens as
paramount]{.mark}, [and views]{.mark} [global security]{.mark}
relationships [through the prism of]{.mark} how that state has
determined its ["national interests"---]{.mark}]{.underline}**which
could well include the security of citizens and other states,
environmental protection, and human rights, but often does not**[. In
this perspective "international security" is the problem of managing
cooperative, competitive and confl ictual relations among states that
act fi rst and foremost according to their own
interests]{.underline}**---however those interests are defi ned. The
interests and security of others can be disregarded or even sacrifi ced
to that end. An alternative perspective---which has gained traction in
the United Nations and among NGOs---is that human security is the
ultimate good, and that national security policies and international
security relations need to aim for that goal. While it remains a
contested concept, among the most compelling accounts of human security
was set out by the United Nations' Commission on Human Security, which
described it as being based on the creation of 'political, social,
environmental, economic, military and cultural systems that together
give people the building blocks of survival, livelihood and dignity' at
an individual and community level. In this view of human security,
systems work holistically and give people both 'freedom from fear' and
'freedom from want' to enable a diverse range of cultures, faiths and
communities to prosper and coexist (Commission on Human Security 2003:
4). A third perspective hovers uneasily between the two, but has also
been infl uential since the end of the Second World War, especially on
the founding of the United Nations and on the development of key arms
control, disarmament, and regional and global security regimes. This
view, linked to liberal and international society perspectives in
international relations thought, is that collective security is the
ultimate end---especially of international law and global cooperation.
This perspective holds that states must subordinate their freedoms and
interests to international law, participate constructively in a
transnational system of security, and consider the security needs and
interests of other states. Later ideas of common and cooperative
security gave even stronger emphasis to a view that security could only
be achieved in common with other states through rule-based cooperative
mechanisms and practices (Evans 1993; Independent Commission 1982). This
perspective shapes the attitudes of many states towards important global
security regimes such as that formed around the United Nations Charter,
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), and to a
lesser extent, regional organisations such as the African Union (AU),
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Organisation
for Security Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). It was also the concern of
important UN documents: the 2004 report of the High Level Panel on
Threats, Challenges and Change, and the Secretary-General's 2005 report,
In Larger Freedom, released prior to the most signifi cant conference of
UN member states since the organisation's founding, the 2005 World
Summit. However, the collective security system remains largely
state-centric (even if concerns with human security and crimes against
humanity are increasingly present in UN discussions and Security Council
decision-making) and is ethically troubling in three signifi cant ways.
First, **[[the]{.mark} collective [security system]{.mark} is still
[centred on states' rights and interests]{.mark}, and [affords spoilers
great latitude to damage efforts at global cooperation]{.mark} and
problem-solving]{.underline}**; second, **[the system is riven with
power]{.underline}** play and **[inequality]{.underline}**, especially
when we consider the membership of the Security Council and the veto
powers held by its permanent members; and third, when collective
security turns to coercion and enforcement it can be extremely
destructive of human life and stability, as happened during the
comprehensive trade embargo enforced on Iraq during the 1990s, and is a
risk in any form of "humanitarian" intervention. In this book, we will
argue for a fourth perspective that draws normative inspiration from
aspects of the human and cooperative security approaches and seeks to
harmonise national security practices with legitimate global ends. This
perspective argues, in a "cosmopolitan" way, that global security is the
ultimate end that should govern an ethics of security; that **[the
security of all human beings, communities, ecosystems and states is of
equal value]{.underline}**. The ethics of a global security system holds
that the reduction and prevention of serious harm is an overarching
goal, and that competing claims must wherever possible be harmonised and
negotiated through dialogue, rules and law rather than violence and
coercion. Even where violence might remain regrettably necessary or
ethically defensible, it will still mark a broader failure of the system
to provide comprehensive security and reduce confl ict, and may put all
those other eff orts into peril. More about the core aims and principles
of this cosmopolitan global security ethics is outlined below. We are
aware that such a system will be diffi cult to achieve in a world where
many governments and actors are unsympathetic to its premises, but we
also argue that were this ethics to become infl uential, the security
benefi ts for all states, human beings and the global environment would
be great. It is an ethics aimed at creating security on a universal
basis, rather than providing limited succour to some parts of a world
that merely seeks to manage and limit insecurity. A further word is
needed here about the problem posed by ethical pluralism--- which
contradicts the commonsense view that behaviours and norms can be
divided between those that are ethical and those that are not. **[Ethics
is not a choice to do good when the overwhelming
temptation]{.underline}**---or the easier option---**[is to do
evil;]{.underline}** **[it is,]{.underline}** rather, **[a competing set
of perspectives about what it is to do good, and about what that good
might be]{.underline}**. It is challenging to think, for example, that
an ethic could provide moral sanction to the killing of tens of
thousands of noncombatants to defend a state in a time of "supreme
emergency", a consequence that many consider to be evil. Yet this
argument, made by the respected American philosopher Michael Walzer
(2006: 251--63) in his book Just and Unjust Wars, is just one of many
morally-controversial positions that have been put by "just war"
theorists. Even as they have done so much to defend the principle of
non-combatant immunity and provide rational guidelines for the resort to
war, some just war writers have endorsed the use of torture in extreme
situations and supported preventive war in violation of the United
Nations Charter (Ignatieff 2004: 140; Bellamy 2006c; Burke 2005;
Reus-Smit 2005). As much as it may occasionally disturb us, **[ethics is
a contested and morally pluralistic space]{.underline}**, one **[that
promises as much danger as benefit to humankind and the planet we depend
on]{.underline}**. In short, **[ethics is contained in everything we do
and are, and the very possibility of security (or insecurity) for
billions of human beings hinges on it.]{.underline}**

illegitimacy of **[recent transformations in security

on terror'. On the one hand[**, [policymakers]{.mark}** and their
supporters have frequently **[argued]{.mark}** that the rules of the

without trial, derogation from human rights law[, **complicity in
torture**,]{.underline} 'extraordinary rendition', the curtailment of
civil liberties [**and** the **securitization**]{.underline} of
migration. On the other hand, critical approaches to security have
converged upon the concept of exceptionalism as a means of analysing and
contesting these transformations.

By now it is fair to say that **[the United States has come to be
dominated by two grand and dangerous hallucinations: the promise of
benign US globalization and the permanent threat of the "war on
terror."]{.underline}** I have come to feel that **[we cannot understand
the extravagance of the violence to which the US government has
committed itself after 9/11---two countries invaded, thousands of
innocent people imprisoned, killed, and
tortured]{.underline}**---**[unless we grasp a defining feature of our
moment]{.underline}**, that is, **[a deep and disturbing doubleness with
respect to power]{.underline}**. **[Taking shape]{.underline}**, as it
now does, **[around fantasies of global omnipotence]{.underline}**
(**[Operation Infinite Justice, the War to End All Evil]{.underline}**)
**[coinciding with nightmares of impending attack, the United States has
entered the domain of paranoia]{.underline}**: **[dream world and
catastrophe]{.underline}**. For **[it is only in paranoia that one
finds]{.underline}** simultaneously and in such condensed form **[both
deliriums of absolute power and forebodings of perpetual
threat]{.underline}**. Hence **[the spectral and nightmarish quality of
the "war on terror,"]{.underline}** a **[limitless war against a
limitless threat]{.underline}**, a war **[vaunted by the US
administration to encompass all of space and persisting without
end]{.underline}**. **[But the war on terror is not a real war, for
"terror" is not an identifiable enemy nor a]{.underline}** strategic,
**[real-world target]{.underline}**. **[The war on terror
is]{.underline}** what William Gibson calls elsewhere **["a consensual
hallucination,"]{.underline}** 4 **[and the US government can fling its
military might against ghostly apparitions and hallucinate a victory
over all evil only at the cost of catastrophic self-delusion and the
infliction of great calamities elsewhere]{.underline}**. I have come to
feel that **[we urgently need to make visible]{.underline}** (the better
politically to challenge) **[those established but concealed circuits of
imperial violence that now animate the war on terror]{.underline}**.
**[We need]{.underline}**, as urgently, **[to illuminate the
continuities that connect those circuits of imperial violence abroad
with the vast, internal shadowlands of prisons and
supermaxes]{.underline}**---**[the modern "slave-ships on the middle
passage to nowhere"]{.underline}**---**[that have come to characterize
the United States as a super-carceral state]{.underline}**. 5 Can we,
the uneasy heirs of empire, now speak only of national things? **[If a
long-established but primarily covert US imperialism has]{.underline}**,
since 9/11, **[manifested itself more aggressively as an overt empire,
does the terrain and object of intellectual inquiry, as well as the
claims of political responsibility, not also extend beyond that useful
fiction of the "exceptional nation" to embrace the shadowlands of
empire?]{.underline}** If so, **[how can we theorize the]{.underline}**
phantasmagoric, **[imperial violence that has come]{.underline}** so
dreadfully **[to constitute our kinship with the ordinary, but which
also at the same moment renders extraordinary the]{.underline}**
ordinary **[bodies of ordinary people]{.underline}**, an **[imperial
violence which in collusion with a complicit corporate media would
render itself invisible, casting states of emergency into fitful shadow
and fleshly bodies into specters?]{.underline}** For **[imperialism is
not something that happens elsewhere, an offshore fact to be deplored
but as easily ignored.]{.underline}** Rather, **[the force of empire
comes to reconfigure, from within, the nature and violence of the
nation-state itself]{.underline}**, giving rise to perplexing questions:
Who under an empire are "we," the people? And who are the ghosted,
ordinary people beyond the nation-state who, in turn, constitute "us"?
**[We now inhabit a crisis of violence and the visible.]{.underline}**
How do we insist on seeing the violence that the imperial state attempts
to render invisible, while also seeing the ordinary people afflicted by
that violence? For **[to allow the spectral, disfigured people
(especially those under torture]{.underline}**) **[obliged to inhabit
the haunted no-places and penumbra of empire to be made visible as
ordinary people is to forfeit the long-held US claim of moral and
cultural exceptionalism, the traditional self-identity of the United
States as the uniquely superior, universal standard-bearer of moral
authority, a tenacious, national mythology of originary innocence now in
tatters. The deeper question, however, is]{.underline}** not only how to
see but also **[how to theorize and oppose the violence without becoming
beguiled by the seductions of spectacle alone.]{.underline}** 6 Perhaps
**[in the labyrinths of torture we must also find a way to speak with
ghosts, for specters disturb the authority of vision and the hauntings
of popular memory disrupt the great forgettings of official
history.]{.underline}** Paranoia Even the paranoid have enemies.
---Donald Rumsfeld Why paranoia? Can we fully understand the
proliferating circuits of imperial violence---the very eclipsing of
which gives to our moment its uncanny, phantasmagoric cast---without
understanding the pervasive presence of the paranoia that has come,
quite violently, to manifest itself across the political and cultural
spectrum as a defining feature of our time? By paranoia, I mean not
simply Hofstadter's famous identification of the US state's tendency
toward conspiracy theories. 7 Rather, I conceive of **[paranoia as an
inherent contradiction with respect to power]{.underline}**: a
double-sided phantasm **[that oscillates]{.underline}** precariously
**[between deliriums of grandeur and nightmares of perpetual threat, a
deep and dangerous doubleness with respect to power]{.underline}** that
is **[held in unstable tension, but which, if suddenly
destabilized]{.underline}** (as after 9/11), **[can produce pyrotechnic
displays of violence]{.underline}**. The pertinence of understanding
paranoia, I argue, lies in its peculiarly intimate and peculiarly
dangerous relation to violence.

#### Representational justifications of torture renders life bare and created the conditions for foreign intervention and nuclear war -- we control the root cause

Slavoj **Zizek 2005**, Slavoj Zizek is a senior researcher in the
Department of Philosophy at the Institute of Sociology, University of
Ljubljana, "BIOPOLITICS: BETWEEN ABU GHRAIB AND TERRI SCHIAVO."

DS)

The fate of Terri Schiavo and **[the fate of the tortured prisoners are
the]{.underline}** two **[extremes of America\'s regard for human
rights:]{.underline}** on the one hand \"those missed by the bombs\"
(mentally and physically complete human beings who must be deprived of
all rights), on the other hand a human being reduced to bare vegetative
life (the living dead whose \"life\" must be protected by the entire
state apparatus). What these two opposites share is **[a reduction to
bare lif]{.underline}**e. In the Schiavo case, this reduction is a
biological reality, which is why her life deserves protection; in the
case of tortured prisoners, this reduction is imposed by the state
apparatus, which is why their lives are deemed unworthy of protection.
Terri Schiavo not only deserved to enjoy every human right but must have
them forced on her, though she was unable in any event to make use of
them as a person; the tortured prisoners are able to use\--and
presumably desperate to be granted\--any human right but must be
deprived of all. **[The legitimization of torture and the excessive care
for a human life reduced to vegetative state are thus two manifestations
of the same grotesque logic.]{.underline}** There is, however, a further
phantasmic element that sustains the tolerance for torture\--that of
being exposed to a potential or invisible threat: **[It is the invisible
(and for that very reason all-powerful and omnipresent) threat of the
Enemy that legitimizes the permanent state of emergency of the
Established Power.]{.underline}** (Fascists invoked the threat of the
Jewish conspiracy, Stalinists the threat of the class enemy, and today,
of course, we have the \"war on terror.\") **[This invisible threat of
the Enemy legitimizes the logic of the preemptive strike. Precisely
because the threat is virtual, one can\'t wait for its actualization,
the omnipresent invisible threat of \"terror\" legitimizes the all too
visible protective measures of defense]{.underline}** (which, of course,
pose the only true threat to democracy and human rights). If the classic
exercise of power lay in the threat made operative precisely by way of
never actualizing itself, by way of remaining a threatening gesture (a
stratagem that reached its climax in the cold war, wherein the threat of
the mutual nuclear destruction had to remain a threat), **[with the war
on terror, the invisible threat causes the incessant actualization not
of itself but of the measures against itself. The nuclear strike had to
remain the threat of a strike, while the threat of the terrorist strike
triggers an endless series of strikes against alleged and even merely
potential terrorists.]{.underline}** The power that presents itself as
being always under threat, living in mortal danger, and thus merely
defending itself is the most dangerous kind of power, the very model of
Nietzschean ressentiment and moralistic hypocrisy\--and was it not
Nietzsche himself who, more than a century ago, provided avant la lettre
the best analysis of the false moral premises of today\'s \"war on
terror\"? No government admits any more that it keeps an army to satisfy
occasionally the desire for conquest. Rather **[the army is supposed to
serve for defense, and one invokes the morality that approves of
self-defense. But this implies one\'s own morality and the neighbor\'s
immorality; for the neighbor must be thought of as eager to attack and
conquer if our state must think of means of self-defense.]{.underline}**
Moreover, the reasons we give for requiring an army imply that our
neighbor, who denies the desire for conquest just as much as does our
own state, and who, for his part, also keeps an army only for reasons of
self-defense, is a hypocrite and a cunning criminal who would like
nothing better than to overpower a harmless and awkward victim without
any fight. Thus all states are now ranged against each other: they
presuppose their neighbor\'s bad disposition and their own good
disposition. This presupposition, however, is inhumane, as bad as war
and worse. At bottom, indeed**[, it]{.underline}** is itself the
challenge and the cause of wars, because, as I have said, it
**[attributes immorality to the neighbor and thus provokes a hostile
disposition and act]{.underline}**. We must abjure the doctrine of the
army as a means of self-defense just as completely as the desire for
conquests.

#### Our representational ethic matters -- Reducing debate to the question of policymaking centered on technical, managerial comparisons suppresses contestation over the social relations out of which those policies emerge.

**Swynegdouw 15** \[2015, Erik Achille Marie Swyngedouw is professor of
geography at the University of Manchester in the School of Environment
and Development, \"Depoliticized environments and the promises of the
Anthropocene\", Chapter 10 in the International handbook of political

Žižek (1999b, 2006a) and Mouffe (2005) define post-politics as a
political formation that forecloses the political.
**[Post-politicization reduces political terrain to the sphere of
consensual governing and [policy-making centered on technical,
managerial]{.mark} and consensual [administration]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(**[policing]{.underline}**) **[of environmental, social, economic or
other domains]{.underline}**. **[These efforts remain [within the realm
of existing social relations]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} '**[The
ultimate sign of post-politics]{.underline}** in all Western countries',
Žižek (2002: 303) argues, '**[is the growth of a managerial approach to
government: government [is]{.mark} reconceived as a managerial function,
[deprived of its]{.mark} proper [political dimension'.]{.mark} Today's
consensual times]{.underline}** thus **[eliminate a genuine political
space of disagreement]{.underline}**. Under a post-political condition,
'\[e\]verything is politicized, can be discussed, but only in a
non-committal way and as a non-conflict. **[[Absolute and irreversible
choices are kept away; politics]{.mark} becomes something one can do
[without making decisions]{.mark} that divide and
separate']{.underline}** (Diken and Laustsen, 2004: 15). **[Difficulties
and problems, such as re-ordering the climate or re-shaping the
environment]{.underline}**, which are generally staged and accepted as
problematic, **[need to be dealt with through]{.underline}** compromise,
**[managerial and technical arrangement]{.underline}**, and the
production of consensus. Key here is 'the annulment of dissensus ... the
"end of politics"' (Rancière, 2001: §32; see also Swyngedouw, 2009).
**[Climate governance and the policing of environmental concerns are
pivotal]{.underline}** arenas through which post-political consensus is
constructed, **[when '[politics]{.mark} proper [is]{.mark} progressively
[replaced by]{.mark} expert social
[administration']{.mark}]{.underline}** (Žižek, 2005: 117). **[The
postpoliticizing environmental consensus is thus radically reactionary,
[forestalling the articulation of]{.mark} conflicting or [alternative
trajectories of future]{.mark} environmental
[dynamics]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[There is [no contestation
over]{.mark} the [givens]{.mark} of the situation, over the partition of
the sensible]{.underline}**; **[there is [only debate over technologies
of management]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[timing of their
implementation]{.underline}**, **[arrangements of policing and the
interests of those whose voices are recognized as
legitimate]{.underline}**. In this post-political era, adversarial
politics (of the left/right variety or of radically divergent struggles
over imagining different socio-environmental futures, for example) are
considered hopelessly out of date. **[Disagreement and debate are still
possible, but operate within a model]{.underline}** of elite consensus
and agreement (Crouch, 2004), **[subordinated to a
managerial--technocratic regime]{.underline}** (Jörke, 2005; Blühdorn,
2006). **[Disagreement is allowed, but only about the choice of
(eco-)technologies]{.underline}**, **[the mix of organizational
fixes]{.underline}**, **[the detail of the (eco-)managerial
adjustments]{.underline}**, **[and the urgency of their timing and
implementation, not with respect to the socio-political framing of
present and future natures.]{.underline}** Thus **[environmental and
other politics are reduced to the sphere of the police, to the domain of
managing, governing]{.underline}** and polic(y)ing through
'participatory' procedures within a given hierarchical structure.
Consensual policy-making in which **[the
[stakeholders]{.mark}]{.underline}** (i.e. **[those with recognized
speech]{.underline}**) **[[are known in advance]{.mark} and where
[disruption or dissent is reduced to debates over]{.mark} the
[institutional]{.mark} modalities of [governing]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[the accountancy calculus of risk]{.underline}**, and **[the
technologies of expert administration or management]{.underline}**,
**[announces the end of politics]{.underline}**, **[annuls dissent from
the consultative spaces of policy-making]{.underline}**, **[and
evacuates the properly political from the public sphere]{.underline}**.

#### Initiating the discussion within the debate community can lead to social change -- social capital from ballots spill over to the cause

**Klandermans '11** \-- Professor in Applied Social Psychology at the
VU-University, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. He has published extensively
on the social psychology of political protest and social movement
participation (Bert, "Who Participates and Why?,
https://www.uu.nl/sites/default/files/sim-special-36_50_years_of_amnesty_international.pdf//JC)

**[The supply side of collective action is neither static nor
constant]{.underline}**. In fact, **[it has to be
constructed]{.underline}** every mobilisation campaign again -- be it
not from scratch. In the literature this has been defined as assembling
a mobilising structure. Mobilising structures are those collective
vehicles, informal as well as formal, through which people mobilise and
engage in collective action. Mobilising structures are the connecting
tissue between organisers and participants. At any time, all kinds of
groups, organisations and networks that exist in a society can become
part of a mobilising structure. However, none can be assumed to
automatically become part of it. Networks need to be adapted,
appropriated, assembled and activated by organisers in order to function
as mobilising structures. **[Social embeddedness plays a crucial role in
these processes of mobilisation]{.underline}**. Depending on their
embeddedness organisers are naturally connected to some people rather
than others. People whom they are connected with are not only more
likely to be targeted, but also more susceptible to views disseminated
by organisers they are affiliated with. In processes of framing, social
movement organisations work hard to turn grievances into claims, to
point out targets to be addressed, to create moral outrage and anger,
and to stage events where all this can be vented. They weave together a
moral, cognitive, and ideological package, and communicate that
appraisal of the situation to the movement's mobilisation potential. In
doing so, **[social movement organisations play a significant role in
the process of construction and reconstruction of collective beliefs and
in the transformation of individual discontent into collective
action]{.underline}**. Grievances can be framed in terms of violated
interests and/or violated principles. We hold that campaigns that
emphasise the Who Participates and Why? SIM Special 36 235 violation of
interests more likely resonate with instrumental motives, while
**[campaigns that emphasise the violation of principles more likely
resonate with ideological motives.]{.underline}** Dynamics of demand.
Demand is about the characteristics of mobilisation potential. Who are
the people who are ready to engage in activities of a specific social
movement? What are their grievances and emotions? Which collective
identity do they share? How are they embedded in social and virtual
networks? A movement's mobilisation potential is not a collection of
isolated individuals. Individuals are embedded in formal, informal and
virtual networks. People's informal, formal and virtual embeddedness are
key-factors in the formation of mobilisation potential. Social
embeddedness. A **[movement's mobilisation potential can be described in
terms of the social capital accumulated in it. Social capital can be
defined as resources embedded in a social structure which can be
accessed and/or mobilised in purposive actions. The concept of social
capital has important implications for advancing our understanding of
the role of social embeddedness in protest participation]{.underline}**.
As a set of relationships, social capital has various attributes, which
are categorised into three components: a structural, a relational, and a
cognitive component. The structural component of social capital refers
to the presence or absence of network ties between actors, and it
essentially defines who can be reached. The relational component of
social capital concerns the kinds of personal relationships people have
developed through a history of interaction. It focuses on the particular
relationships people have, such as respect, trust and friendship. The
cognitive component is defined as those resources providing shared
representations, interpretations and systems of meaning. **[The
cognitive dimension is in protest literature referred to as \"raised
consciousness\" -- a set of political beliefs and action orientations
arising out of an awareness of similarity]{.underline}**.
**[Consciousness-raising takes place within social
networks]{.underline}**. **[It is within these networks that individual
processes such as grievance formation, strengthening of efficacy,
identification and group-based emotions all synthesise into a
motivational constellatio]{.underline}**n Bert Klandermans 236 SIM
Special 36 which prepares people for action and builds mobilisation
potential. **[Social embeddedness plays a pivotal role in]{.underline}**
the **[contex]{.underline}**t of protest, but why? The effect of
interaction in networks **[on the propensity to participate in politics
is contingent on the amount of political discussion that occurs in
social networks]{.underline}**, and the information that people are able
to gather about politics as a result. **[Networks provide space for the
creation and dissemination of discourse critical of authorities, and it
provides a way for active opposition to these authorities to
grow]{.underline}**. In other words, **[this is where people talk
politics and, thus, where the factuality of the socio-political world is
constructed and people are mobilised for protest]{.underline}**.

## 1ac -- Soft Left

### 1AC -- Advantage -- Torture Devices

#### It\'s illegal to own weapons but not produce them in the US -- that ensures thousands are subject to torture globally

\[HS\]

"**[The U.S. is a world leader in the torture trade, with devastating
and deadly consequences for tens of thousands of people]{.underline}**,"
said William F. Schulz, executive director of Amnesty International USA.
"[The torture weapons industry]{.underline} is one [where 'Made in the
USA']{.underline} [should be]{.underline} a badge [of
shame]{.underline}." [U.S. companies produced more than \$97 million in
"crime control equipment," including chains, leg irons, chemical
controls]{.underline} such as pepper spray, stun belts and stun guns
between 1997 and February 2000,according to U.S. Department of Commerce
documents included in the report. "No one should profit from torture,"
Schulz said. Amnesty International USA, an arm of the London-based human
rights organization, called the Bush administration to ban the use,
manufacture and trade of instruments of torture. "[In the absence of
stringent worldwide controls to prevent this ...,export should be
immediately halted]{.underline}," according to the report, Stopping the
Torture Trade. Amnesty International officials have not met with the
Bush administration yet to discuss the topic, but had met with the
Clinton administration, Schulz said. The organization's report did not
call for banning of tear gas or handcuffs, said author of the report,
Brian Wood. But those, too, lend themselves to abuse, he said. "There
cannot be a solution to this problem unless it's an international
solution," he said. [While traditional instruments of torture such as
leg irons and serrated thumb cuffs remain popular in the torturers'
arsenals, electroshock weapons are gaining clout]{.underline}, Schulz
said. "Amnesty International has found that the number of [companies
worldwide]{.underline} that [manufacture or supply high-tech weapons has
soared]{.underline} from 30 in the 1980s to more than 130 today," he
said. "The [manufacture of weapons like this is increasing because they
allow the torturer to do his dirty work without a trace]{.underline}."
[Electroshock techniques do not leave bruises]{.underline} associated
with clubbing or beating, he said. "We're not talking about cattle
prods," Wood said. Electroshock torture can pump up to 50,000 volts
through aerial barbs, remote-activated belts or batons, he said. The
shock goes to the nervous systems and circulatory system, causing the
victim to lose control of bodily functions. "[What began in the United
States has become a free-for-all,]{.underline}" Wood said. [The Commerce
Department granted the export licenses to countries in which the State
Department has documented torture and ill-treatment]{.underline}, Schulz
said. Russia, identified by the State Department as a violator of human
rights, purchased more than \$4 million in torture tools from U.S.
companies between 1997 and February 2000. Israel purchased more than \$2
million in the same period. [Mexico was the United State's top client of
torture paraphernalia, according to U.S. Department of
Commerce]{.underline} documents included in the report. [Mexico bought
more than \$15 million in tools from U.S. companies]{.underline} between
1997 and February 2000. [Sweden toped the list of Commerce
Department-approved destinations for an export classification that
includes optical sighting devices, stun guns and shock
baton]{.underline}s, according to the report. Between 1997 and February
2000,Sweden purchased almost \$9 million in electroshock. And
electroshock technology is banned in Sweden. "It is outrageous and
unacceptable that while owning these weapons [in our
nation]{.underline}'s capital [is unlawful]{.underline}, [it
is]{.underline} perfectly [legal for U.S. companies to manufacture,
supply and export weapons like this to countries where torture
occurs]{.underline}," Schulz said.

#### Multiple US companies produce torture devices

\[HS\]

Another company, [Stinger Systems]{.underline} ([based in Tampa,
Florida]{.underline}), has [recently introduced]{.underline} a [similar
projectile stun gun]{.underline} to the US market: the S-200. It [fires
two darts]{.underline} and is reported to produce around 60% of the peak
current of the X26 Taser; it can also be [operated as a touch-stun
gun]{.underline}. According to the Stinger Systems website, the trigger
of the S-200 can be set so that [the charge is controlled entirely by
the officer or to deliver an automatic two or four-second
charge]{.underline}. According to company press releases, S-200s have
been purchased by police departments in various states, including
Illinois, Missouri, Ohio, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin.19 [Stinger
Systems also produces other electro-shock products, including the
"Band-It" stun belt, a remote-controlled electrified sleeve]{.underline}
which can be placed on the leg or arm and is used for controlling
prisoners during transportation or when they are in public places (such
as a courthouse). According to the company's website[, the belt
"delivers an incapacitating electric shock" using a wireless remote up
to 175 feet]{.underline} (50 metres) away and can be operated manually
or be "set to go off automatically on movement".20 According to the
website, the Band-It has been used on "tens of thousands of prisoners
nationwide" by local and federal law enforcement agencies, including the
Federal Bureau of Prisons and the US Marshalls Service.21 [Amnesty
International opposes the use of such devices as inherently cruel and
degrading because the wearer is under constant fear of being subjected
to an electric shock for the whole time the belt is worn.]{.underline}22
[Taser International has developed another electro-shock projectile
weapon, the Taser XREP Extended-Range Electronic Projectile]{.underline}
(XREP), in which the electrodes are contained within a shell which can
be fired wire-free from a standard 12-gauge shotgun.23 When [the shell
hits the target, a probe pierces the skin or clothing and a wire falls
from the capsule to create another point of contact which
unleashes]{.underline} a 20-second cycle of the same [electrical
output]{.underline} as the TaserX26. The device was reportedly due to be
piloted in 2008.24 Amnesty International is particularly concerned by
the 20-second default shock built into the XREP, given the potential
adverse effects from prolonged CED exposure. The [company has also
developed the Taser Shockwave, described as an "area denial system"
which could be used for crowd control.]{.underline} The Shockwave, also
due to be piloted in 2008, consists of a unit of six Taser cartridges on
a stand which can be fired remotely from up to 100 feet away using a
control box. [Units can be stacked vertically or linked to form "chains"
--]{.underline} allowing an almost limitless number to be linked[. Each
unit can fire Taser cartridges singly or multiply and can hit several
targets]{.underline} at once when fired into a crowd. The cartridges
deliver a five-second electrical shock, which can be repeated at any
time with the push of a button.25 [This multiple firing capacity, with
its inherently indiscriminate effect, is also a cause for concern to
Amnesty International.]{.underline}

**[A few related events recently took place that highlight the
importance of the torture weapons trade, and the role that private
companies in some countries, notably the United States]{.underline}**
and the United Kingdom, have in it. Their role was stressed in a new
document from Amnesty International called \"Stopping the Torture
Trade,\" which calls for halting the production and trade of torture
weapons. **[The release of this document comes at the same time as the
U.S. State Department report on human rights around the
world]{.underline}**, the accusation against General Hernan Gabrielli of
the **[Chilean Air Force for his participation in torture of political
prisoners]{.underline}** during the Pinochet regime and an Argentine
judge\'s decision to overturn amnesty laws dictated by the military. The
Argentine laws protected from prosecution hundreds of soldiers and
officers who were accused of torture, murder and kidnapping during the
military rule from 1976 to 1983, thus potentially opening the way for a
wave of trials. According to Amnesty International, U.S. companies as
well as companies **[from the United Kingdom, France and Russia
manufacture and sell weapons and other equipment used for torture. Among
them are high-tech electroshock weapons, leg irons and serrated thumb
cuffs]{.underline}** **[designed to tear flesh if a detainee intends to
escape]{.underline}**. Amnesty International believes **[such devices
are \"inherently cruel\" and their trade should be banned
outright.]{.underline}** The United States is the largest supplier of
electro-shock devices. According to Amnesty**[, 86 U.S. companies
manufactured, marketed or sold electro-shock devices]{.underline}**
during the 1990s. William Schulz, head of the U.S. chapter of the
London-based human rights group, stated: \"These weapons are used
against many people who should be heroes to Americans.\" **[In many
countries electro-shock has been routinely used against political
prisoners. Such devices have also been used against children, pregnant
women, the elderly, and the mentally ill.]{.underline}** The Amnesty
report also indicates that the United States, as well the United
Kingdom, China, France and Russia, are among the main providers
worldwide of training to military, police and security forces of foreign
states. Because those forces are the main users of torture technique and
equipment, **[stopping torture means stopping as well the trade and the
training that helps create those \"professional torturers.\" Even though
it is illegal to own some of this equipment in the United States, the
U.S. Department of Commerce has granted licenses for their export under
the category of \"crime control equipment,\" for sales that amount to
\$97 million since 1997]{.underline}**. Data from that Department also
show that Saudi Arabia, Russia, Taiwan, Israel and Egypt are among the
major recipients of U.S. equipment. **[\"It is unconscionable,\" Mr.
Schultz said, \"that while the State Department promotes human rights,
the Department of Commerce has approved export licenses to countries
that our own government documents as committing
torture.\"]{.underline}**

We also know that [torture leaves deep and long-lasting
wounds]{.underline}. [Survivors]{.underline} who receive care at CVT
[endure chronic pain in muscles and joints, from being bound or hung or
confined]{.underline} to small spaces like cages. [They
have]{.underline} [balance and mobility issues]{.underline}, often [from
being beaten]{.underline} on the soles of the feet or lower legs. They
have a range of [sleep disorders]{.underline}, [from]{.underline}
sleeplessness to intense and [incessant nightmares in which the
torturers revisit them]{.underline} night after night after night. They
endure [deep depression]{.underline}, [severe anxiety]{.underline} and
frequent [thoughts of suicide]{.underline}. [Torture is psychological as
well as physical]{.underline}. [Torturers]{.underline} [often focus on
ways of inflicting grave pain]{.underline} that never leave a mark on
the flesh: [forced nakedness and sexual humiliation, stress positions,
sleep deprivation, sensory overload, sensory deprivation and mock
execution]{.underline}s are among some of the horrific methods used. One
of the reasons that this fact is important is that it is abused. When
people seek to justify torture, they often argue that if an act doesn't
leave scars, it is not torture. You hear this in connection with
waterboarding. But we know, and medical experts have proven, that [the
psychological effects of torture are as devastating and long-lasting as
physical effects]{.underline}. Indeed, [many survivors]{.underline} we
work with [say it's even worse]{.underline}. Trying to hide torture
behind euphemisms like "enhanced interrogation" is manipulation of the
facts. These [tactics are cruel and debilitating]{.underline}. James
Mitchell himself acknowledged that most [people would rather have their
legs broken than endure waterboarding]{.underline}. [Torture is used to
control communities]{.underline}. At CVT, we work with survivors of
torture committed by repressive regimes around the world. Many of our
clients were highly successful in their lives, in business, in
professional careers and in their communities. [When one person is taken
and tortured, the family learns immediately to be afraid, to be
silent]{.underline}. When a second person is tortured, [the
community]{.underline} quickly gets the message: you [must do whatever
the perpetrators want. Torture takes control]{.underline} swiftly.
[Torture creates]{.underline} such a climate of [fear and
insecurity]{.underline} that it fractures communities, silences dissent
and suppresses civic engagement[. It creates cultures based on apathy
and fear]{.underline}.

concern, or there is evidence that the government may have violated
human rights]{.underline}**. The judicious use of these controls is
intended to deter the development of a consistent pattern of human
rights abuses, distance the United States from such abuses, and avoid
contributing to civil disorder in a country or region. The U.S.
Government maintains a general policy of denial for specially designed
implements of torture, regardless of the intended destination.

#### US companies manufacture shock devices that cause severe pain and trauma

A range of [electric shock devices have been designed and
produced]{.underline} specifically [to be attached directly to
prisoners' bodies]{.underline}. They include [stun belts, stun vests and
stun cuffs]{.underline}. [Prisoners]{.underline} are [forced to
wear]{.underline} these items, sometimes for many hours at a time, [with
the constant threat that they can be remotely triggered at any
moment]{.underline}. On activation, by remote control, they generate [a
high voltage 'pulse current']{.underline} -- typically around 50,000
volts - that [enters the prisoner]{.underline}'s body at the site of the
electrodes, [causing severe pain for the duration of the shock; in
addition muscles contract involuntarily, rendering the subject immobile.
Other physical effects can include muscular weakness, involuntary
urination and defecation, heartbeat irregularities, seizures, and welts
on the skin]{.underline},16 as well as the risk of secondary injuries
caused by falls after activation. Use of [such equipment]{.underline} on
individuals with underlying health issues (such as congenital heart
defects or epilepsy), or on those using psychotropic medications [could
cause heart attacks]{.underline}.17 The continuous [threat]{.underline}
that [the device may be activated at any moment, intentionally or by
accident, causes terrible mental suffering to the wearer]{.underline}.
The [Europe]{.underline}an Commission has [classified]{.underline} body
worn electric shock [devices as having, "No practical use other
than]{.underline} for the purpose of [torture]{.underline} and other
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment" [and prohibits
their trade]{.underline}. 18 [The UN]{.underline} Committee against
Torture has [recommended that stun belts should be
abolished]{.underline}. 19 However [such devices]{.underline} are now
[employed in]{.underline} a number of States including South Africa and
[the United States]{.underline}.20 They are typically used in
courtrooms, for prisoner transfers, or on work details. They are
currently [manufactured by companies in the Americas]{.underline},
Africa and Asia, and have been [promoted]{.underline} by companies [in
all regions of the world]{.underline}.

**[While the FDA allows the ECT device to remain on the market, it

that **[children younger than five and toddlers have been subjected to

states that CCHR has established through Freedom of Information Act
requests. **[Despite a report from the United Nations committee on

abortion, placental abruption, cardiac arrhythmias, fetal burn and
intrauterine fetal death when a pregnant woman experiences general
electrical shock.]{.underline}**\[6\] Yet, the APA claims that it\'s
safe during all trimesters.\[7\] Jan Eastgate, president of CCHR
International, said: **[\"Electroshock is mental euthanasia, with a long
history of being used for torture and abuse]{.underline}**. **[Electric
shock eradicates memory]{.underline}**. **[It should never be condoned
or permitted because quite apart from its inhuman
aspects]{.underline}**, **[patients consider it bluntly
criminal,]{.underline}** especially when forced on them. Psychiatrists
and the FDA pass off electric shock machines as wonderful, even though
they can kill patients.\" Sign CCHR\'s Petition to Ban the Electroshock
(ECT) Device. **[The impact of any electrical shock upon a body for any
purpose is very dangerous]{.underline}**. **[Researchers from the
University of Montreal have shown that any electric shock above 120
volts can \"cause neurologic and neuropsychological symptoms in
humans.]{.underline}** Following an electrical injury, some **[patients
may show various emotional and behavioral aftereffects]{.underline}**,
**[such as memory loss and symptoms of depression.\"]{.underline}**\[8\]
ECT uses up to 460 volts, deliberately inducing a **[grand mal seizure
that the American Psychiatric Association (APA) says can last up to 30
minutes.]{.underline}** ECT: Slaughters Pigs and Tortures ECT was
invented in fascist Italy in 1937 by psychiatrist Ugo Cerletti. Darius
Rejali, author of Torture and Modernity, wrote of Cerletti \"having
killed a few dogs by experimentation\" and then \"discovered that Roman
slaughterhouses used electrocution to slaughter pigs.\" Cerletti
\"discovered that pigs could be shocked several times and would revive
after a few minutes.\" He then applied ECT to humans, his first victim
screaming that it was \"deadly.\" \"The torture and \'treatments\' of
the insane\" historically has derived from the \"application to animals
in abattoirs,\" Rejali stated.\[9\] Cerletti\'s device very rapidly
pressed into political service, Rejali said. In August 2017, a paper
published in History of Psychiatry documented how \"The Nazi political
and medical establishment\" regarded ECT as a means \"to empty
psychiatric institutions, thereby relieving the state of the burden...\"
Psychiatrist Emil Gelny \"added four extra electrodes to existing ECT
machines, which were attached to patients\' wrists and ankles to deliver
the lethal shocks after patients were knocked unconscious by the initial
current applied to the head.\"\[10\] In the 1950s, the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) expressed considerable interest in ECT
devices. In 1951, Project Artichoke, then MK-ULTRA under Deputy CIA
Director Richard Helms in 1953, aimed to control human behavior through
hallucinogenic drugs and electroshock.\[11\] Dr. Ewen Cameron, the first
president of the World Psychiatric Association, while professor of
psychiatry at McGill University in Canada in the 1950s and 60s,
developed his own version of shock treatment, using the UK Page-Russell
electroshock device invented in 1948. Cameron called his shock technique
\"de-patterning\" deliberately wiping out patient memories by the use of
intensive ECT. The CIA funded his work.\[12\] He described the procedure
on a patient to the 2nd World Congress of Psychiatry in 1957, stating:
\"There is complete amnesia for all events of his life.\"\[13\]
Electroshock \'took away her soul\' In 2017, 60 years after Cameron\'s
experiments left her mother damaged for life, Alison Steel obtained a
\$100,000 settlement from the Canadian government over Cameron\'s
experiments. \"She was never able to really function as a healthy human
being because of what they did to her,\" Steel stated. \"Her emotions
were stripped. It took away her soul.\"\[14\] **[Electroshock is also
used for torture, including on prisoners]{.underline}** of the French
during the 1954-62 Algerian War.\[15\] Journalist Gordon Thomas reported
that in 1961, Moroccan king Hassan II\'s security service was fully
staffed with doctors who supervised a wide range of tortures of
political detainees using several Page-Russell electroshock
machines.\[16\] Chinese dissidents and members of the religious group
The Falun Gong are still subjected to electroshock and \"other barbaric
forms of torture designed by prison guards to humiliate and inflict
maximum pain.\"\[17\] Until 1973, when the APA de-classified
homosexuality as a mental disorder, electroshock treatment was used in
an effort to prevent or eliminate homosexual behavior.\[18\] **[Other
forms of shock included jolts of electricity administered to the skin
and body,]{.underline}** sometimes directly to the genitals.\[19\]
**[Voltage of such devices ranged anywhere from 150-200 volts and on
children for behavioral control]{.underline}**, 300-400 volts.\[20\]
Allegations that psychiatrists and any others recommending ECT to treat
the LGBT community today are homophobic and cruel, CCHR says.\[21\]
Brain Damage and Memory Loss Yet the FDA and APA continue to ignore the
perils of ECT. **[In March 2016, a coroner from Sunderland County in the
UK determined Elsie Tindle died after electroshock triggered an
epileptic fit which caused irreparable brain
damage]{.underline}**.\[22\] **[A 2012 study published in Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences reported a considerable \"decrease in
functional connectivity\" between the prefrontal lobes of the brain and
other parts of the brain after ECT.]{.underline}** The most extensive
long-term follow-up study indicates that \"most ECT patients will never
recover from the damage in the form of persistent severe mental
deficits.\"\[23\] Austin, Texas, psychologist John Breeding, who heads
the Coalition for the Abolition of Electroshock, said, **[\"The bottom
line is that ECT \'works\' to the extent that it damages and disables
the brain]{.underline}**.\"\[24\] Breeding dispels psychiatric theories
that the procedure is safer today than its \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s
Nest\" days in the 60s. **[He says that ECT has more potential for harm
than ever. Much higher voltages are employed in the modern
procedure]{.underline}** because muscle relaxants and anesthetics raise
the seizure threshold, with more electricity required to produce a
seizure. **[The greater heat and electricity themselves cause more brain
cell death]{.underline}**, he says. He concludes \"Given what we know
about the resulting brain damage, I think this is a form of
assault...\"\[25\]

#### Torture trade should be controlled to prevent misuse of security equipment

**Omega \'19** (Omega Research Foundation Established in 1990, we
provide rigorous, objective, evidence-based research on the manufacture,
trade, and use of, military, security and police (MSP) equipment.  Such
technologies range from small arms and light weapons to large weapon
systems; from policing technologies and prison equipment to equipment
used for torture, amongst others., 2019, \"Trade in the \"Tools of
Torture\",
https://omegaresearchfoundation.org/our-work/trade-tools-torture) \[HS\]

[International law prohibits torture and other cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment or punishment]{.underline} (ill-treatment)
throughout the world, at all times and in all circumstances and covers
both [complicity as well as direct participation]{.underline} in such
practices. Recognised as a [peremptory norm of general international
law](http://legal.un.org/legislativeseries/documents/Book25/Book25_part2_ch3.pdf),
[the prohibition is binding and absolute, whether or not states are
parties to particular treaties]{.underline}. Despite this, law
enforcement and other state [officials carry out or allow torture and
ill-treatment all over the world]{.underline}. The [prohibition on
torture and ill-treatment should also apply to the
manufacture]{.underline} and use of prison and police [weapons and
equipment that are inherently abusive]{.underline} and have no purpose
other than to inflict torture and ill-treatment. This [includes body
worn electric shock belts, electric shock batons, weighted leg
restraints, thumb cuffs and spiked batons]{.underline}. Recognising the
danger that the failure to control trade will facilitate or fuel torture
and ill-treatment, the United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly
called upon: [**["\[A\]ll States to take appropriate effective
legislative, administrative, judicial and other measures to prevent and
prohibit the production, trade, export, import and use of equipment that
has no practical use other than for the purpose of torture or other
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
punishment.]{.underline}**"](http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/146)
In addition Omega believes that [there should be controls on the
trade]{.underline} and use of law enforcement equipment [that could be
misused for torture and ill-treatment]{.underline} but could also have a
legitimate law enforcement purpose, such as handcuffs, police batons and
chemical irritants (commonly known as tear gas and pepper spray).
Although certain countries and regions, such as the [European
Union](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=URISERV%3Ar12535),
have introduced controls in this area, [the majority have not and the
controls that do exist can still be improved]{.underline}. Consequently,
a core focus of Omega's mission to combat torture and ill-treatment, is
our ongoing programme to promote and facilitate the development and
implementation of national, regional and international controls to
effectively regulate the trade in security and law enforcement
equipment.

#### The US can end reasonably end sales now -- banning torture device exports prevents second hand acquisition by regimes

**[So concludes a new Amnesty International report, which shines a
spotlight on the makers of law enforcement equipment and how their
devices are used by torturers around the world]{.underline}** (including
in the United States). **[Amnesty has compiled a list of more than 80
U.S. manufacturers and suppliers of electro-shock weapons and
restraints]{.underline}**. Amnesty does not allege that any one or
another of these companies is involved in the international trade in
equipment used in torture. But Amnesty\'s report, \"Stopping the Torture
Trade,\" does provide numerous examples of U.S. products being used by
torturers overseas, as well as in the United States. The Khiam detention
center, closed in May 2000, \"had been run by the South Lebanon Army,
Israel\'s proxy militia in the former occupied south Lebanon, **[with
the involvement of the Israeli army, but the handcuffs used to suspend
detainees from an electricity pylon where they were doused with water
and given electric shocks were clearly marked \`The Peerless Handcuff
Co. Springfield, Mass.]{.underline}** Made in USA,\"\' Amnesty reports.
In a letter to Amnesty, Peerless expressed disgust that its products
were used in the Khiam prison, stating, \"In no way does Peerless
Handcuff Company condone or support the use of our products for torture
or for any other human rights abuse. \... We have not sold any
restraints to the Israeli government or Israeli companies in almost 10
years.\" Asked if Peerless take steps to control the sale of equipment
to torturers, a company spokesperson says, \"We restrict our sales as
best we can to what we know are legitimate law enforcement
authorities.\" Asked if the company has refused sales to \"legitimate\"
law enforcement authorities who are known torturers, the Peerless
spokesperson says the company refuses to sell to, among other countries,
China, North Korea, Iran and Iraq, and has turned down sales requests
from these and other nations. \"We have no interest in promoting\" sales
to torturers, the Peerless spokesperson says. But, he adds, \"I don\'t
think manufacturers can be held responsible\" for misuse by law
enforcement agencies. The Peerless case is not unique. **[Amnesty says
it has \"received numerous reports in recent years of the use of
shackles and handcuffs in the torture and ill-treatment of detainees in
Saudi Arabia.]{.underline}** **[Several former prisoners have described
how the security forces used restraints in coercing
confessions.]{.underline}**\" **[Several of the prisoners have reported
that the restraints were stamped with the name of the U.S.based Smith &
Wesson]{.underline}** or with Hiatts, a UK company. **[\"Stopping the
Torture Trade\" focuses as well on electro-shock weapons]{.underline}**,
**[which have been used to torture or ill-treat people in at least 76
countries, including the United States]{.underline}**, over the last
decade. **[\"Electroshock devices have been deliberately, and often
repeatedly, applied to prisoners\' mouths, genitals and other sensitive
parts the body]{.underline}**,\" the Amnesty report says**[.
\"Electro-shock torture is often combined with other forms of torture
and ill-treatment, including psychological torture.\" A new
electro-shock technology is the stun belt]{.underline}**, which is worn
by a prisoner and remotely activated by the incarcerator, from as far as
100 yards away. **[A typical stun belt delivers an eight-second shock of
50,000 volts]{.underline}**, according to Amnesty. \"The belt relies on
the prisoner\'s constant fear of severe pain being inflicted at any time
while held in a situation of powerlessness,\" Amnesty says. The leading
U.S. manufacturer of stun belts says exactly the same thing. Stun Tech
literature says, \"After all, if you were wearing a contraption around
your waist that by the mere push of a button in someone else\'s hand,
could make you defecate or urinate yourself, what would you do from the
psychological point of view?\" Amnesty quotes Dennis Kaufman, president
of Stun Tech as saying, \"Electricity speaks every language known to
man. No translation necessary. Everybody is afraid of electricity, and
rightfully so.\" **[Amnesty International is urging the United States
and other governments to ban the use, manufacture, promotion and trade
of police and security equipment whose use is inherently cruel, inhuman
or degrading. The group includes leg irons, electro-shock stun belts and
inherently painful devices such as serrated thumbcuffs in this category.
Amnesty is also calling for a suspension on the use and trade in
devices, such as electro-shock equipment, whose medical effects are not
fully known. And the group is calling for a suspension of trade in
equipment that has shown a substantial risk of abuse or unwarranted
injury, including legcuffs, thumbcuffs]{.underline}**, restraint chairs
and pepper gas weapons. **[\"It is crucially important that the United
States act immediately in these areas,]{.underline}**\" says Amnesty
International USA spokesperson Alistair Hodgett**[. \"The United States
has led the way in the development of new technologies used in torture,
such as electro-shock devices.]{.underline}** After export, they have
quickly been replicated and spread around the world.\" **[Such
regulatory measures as advocated by Amnesty seem reasonably achievable
in the United States.]{.underline}** **[Law enforcement equipment that
can be used for torture is made and supplied primarily by small
equipment makers and even smaller suppliers and distributors with little
political clout.]{.underline}**

#### US provides most torture equipment government action is key

**Martin and Wright 03**

(Brian Martin, AND Steve Wright, "Countershock: Mobilizing resistance to
electroshock weapons," Medicine, Conflict and Survival pp. 205-206,
<https://doi.org/10.1080/13623690308409692>) // WhtCbn

**[There is growing evidence that non-lethal weapons are not
benign]{.underline}** - indeed, they can be lethal - **[and are forming
a new arsenal used primarily against the exercise of
freedom]{.underline}**, rather than in defence of it.5 At an expert
briefing in October 2002 between Amnesty International, European
Commission officers, the Omega Foundation, police and medical experts
and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, participants were
told that **[there are 230 known manufacturers, distributors, suppliers
or brokers of electroshock weapons and 69 of leg irons, shackles or
thumbcuffs.]{.underline}** **[The]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[has the largest
number of companies providing restraint technology]{.underline}** (43),
followed by Western Europe (ten). Similarly, **[the US has the most
companies providing electroshock equipment]{.underline}** (81), followed
by the Asia-Pacific (56), Western Europe (41), Eastern-Central Europe
(23), Africa (11), the Middle East (ten) and Latin America (eight).6
Thus **[the West provides the largest share of the torture technology
supply pipeline with 77 per cent of the total companies actively
involved in the provision of restraint technology and over half of the
world\'s companies in the proliferation of electroshock
weapons]{.underline}**. Of course the number of companies is only one
part of the story: a single company might be making scores of thousands
of electroshock weapons**[. These weapons provide means for restraint
and torture, yet there are powerful corporate, government and public
relations forces seeking to present these weapons in a favourable
light]{.underline}** and, despite rhetoric about human rights, to carry
on business as usual. In such circumstances, it is important for
researchers to expose what is going on and investigate how these weapons
can best be opposed. Therefore, we start with the **[assumption that it
is important to oppose the production and trade in the technology of
repression]{.underline}**. The question is how to go about it. **[One
approach is through government regulation]{.underline}**. This can be
valuable, but it has seldom proved effective on its own. **[Nor does the
existence of international agreements about torture, on their own,
appear to achieve very much]{.underline}**. After all, **[no government
admits to using torture, yet it is known that dozens use or tolerate it
as a matter of policy]{.underline}**. The focus of this article is on
independent campaigning: a number of non-governmental organizations
(NGOs), such as Amnesty International and Campaign Against the Arms
Trade, play an important role in exposing and opposing the trade and use
of repression technologies.7 Our aim is to assess which sorts of
interventions are likely to be most effective in generating support and
action

#### The U.S. must take POLICY action to prevent its production and trade of shock torture devices

Restraints [Body worn electric shock equipment, often referred to as
stun cuffs]{.underline}, stun sleeves, or [stun belts, are designed to
deliver an electric shock to the wearer when activated]{.underline} by
remote control. They are [used to enforce compliance through the fear of
pain]{.underline} [or,]{.underline} if activated, to enforce [compliance
through pain]{.underline}. [Their use has been]{.underline}
internationally [condemned by U]{.underline}nited [N]{.underline}ations
[and European torture prevention monitors]{.underline} and the European
Commission has imposed an import and export ban on this equipment under
EC Regulation 1236/2005 which condemns **[the devices]{.underline}** as
**[hav]{.underline}**ing **["no practical use other than]{.underline}**
for the purpose of **[torture]{.underline}** and other cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment or punishment"; thus enabling a de facto EU-wide ban
on their use. [Omega recommends]{.underline} a complete prohibition on
the transfer to LEAs of body worn electric shock equipment. Furthermore
**[that the US take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or
other measures to prevent the manufacture, trade, and use of body worn
electric shock devices.]{.underline}**

**[The fact of the matter is that torture is illegal]{.underline}**.
**[The prohibition of torture, and all forms of ill-treatment, is
absolute --- everywhere and at all times]{.underline}**. **[It is
strictly forbidden by international human rights law, U.S.
jurisprudence, the United Nations Convention against Torture, and the
Geneva Conventions]{.underline}** --- **[a body of law embraced by the
U.S.]{.underline}** and its military **[since the 19th
Century.]{.underline}** Importantly, **[torture is morally reprehensible
and it should be permanently repudiated by all nations]{.underline}**.
**[Torture and other forms of cruel or humiliating treatment are an
affront to humanity, and the physical and psychological scars can last a
lifetime. It is morally wrong because it dehumanizes the
victims]{.underline}**, the perpetrators, and the society that surrounds
them. **[Torture can destroy the social fabric of communities, degrade a
society's institutions, and undermine the integrity of its political
systems.]{.underline}** I know that no country on Earth is entirely
immune to what amounts to an ages-old temptation, and some people
reading this might think, "That's easy for you to say. Sometimes you
have to make tough choices in the name of national security." **[I would
argue that those who believe that perceived, near term tactical gains
are worth risking long term and potentially dangerous consequences, are
shortsighted]{.underline}**. Experience shows that the **[reliance on
illegal, immoral, and inhumane interrogation techniques is universally a
very poor choice]{.underline}**. The International Committee of the Red
Cross visits roughly half a million detainees in nearly 100 countries
each year. **[It's our job to try to prevent and put an end to torture
and ill-treatment.]{.underline}** During my time as president of the
ICRC, I have met in person with detainees, who have experienced
ill-treatment at the hands of their captors, and I know for a fact that
abuse only grows hatred. It sows the seeds of revenge, and nothing
justifies the use of such tactics. I have also observed that **[torture
has a corrupting effect on its perpetrators and the institutions they
serve.]{.underline}** Wherever it takes place and whatever the stakes
involved, it's simply wrong. In the wake of the September 11 terrorist
attacks, the ICRC actively engaged with the U.S. on issues related to
the treatment of detainees held in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo
Bay. Very early on, we decided to invest in a constructive and sustained
dialogue with the American authorities. Even when discussions were
sometimes tense over the past 12 years, the ICRC's commitment to the
detainees never wavered. We remain committed to visiting them,
monitoring their treatment, connecting them with their families, and
consistently reminding the U.S. of their obligations under international
humanitarian law. Today, our relationship with the government is strong.
**[The bottom line is that decisions taken in Washington resonate across
the globe]{.underline}**. **[The U.S. has a major influence on the world
stage and American]{.underline}** detention **[practices can, for better
or for worse, have an impact on the actions of officials]{.underline}**,
prison directors, guards, **[and interrogators in even the most
far-flung places on the planet. That's why this moment in history offers
an opportunity to reaffirm clearly]{.underline}**, and **[for the whole
world to hear, that torture and ill-treatment are fundamentally
wrong]{.underline}**, **[and that unconditionally rejecting such tactics
--- now and forever --- is the right thing to do.]{.underline}**

comes to torture, so too do the general rules on state responsibility.
While the rules on the 'complicity' of states]{.underline}** set out in
article 16 of the Articles on State Responsibility **[may be tightly
circumscribed by relatively high hurdles of causation and intent so as
not to jeopardise legitimate international cooperation, the ILC
recognised that -- when it comes to systematic breaches of peremptory
norms of international law -- different considerations are at
play.]{.underline}** The articles therefore provide two separate rules
recognising that such breaches can 'attract additional consequences, not
only for the responsible State but for all other States'.104 ILC,
'Articles on State Responsibility', 112. View all notes **[The
applicability of these special rules is defined by article 40 as
relating to a 'serious breach' of an 'obligation arising under a
peremptory norm of general international law'. The commentaries make it
clear that the prohibition of torture is considered a peremptory norm of
international law falling within these provisions]{.underline}**.105
Ibid., 113. A breach is considered 'serious' if it involves a 'gross or
systematic failure by the responsible State to fulfil the
obligation'.106 Articles on State Responsibility, article 40(2). **[The
commentaries provide that: '\[t\]o be regarded as systematic, a
violation would have to be carried out in an organized and deliberate
way.]{.underline}** In contrast, the term "gross" refers to the
intensity of the violation or its effects' (at page 113). Article 41(1)
recognises that, **[where there is such a serious breach of an
obligation arising under international law, 'States shall cooperate to
bring to an end through lawful means' any such breach.]{.underline}**
Article 41(2) provides additionally that '**[No State shall recognize as
lawful a situation created by a serious breach...nor render aid or
assistance in maintaining that situation.' The obligation set out under
Article 41(2) is a customary international law
obligation]{.underline}**, as recognised by the ICJ in the Namibia and
Palestinian Wall cases, arising from the 'character and the importance
of the rights and obligations involved'.107 Legal Consequences for
States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia, ICJ Reports
1971 16, para. 117 (1970); Legal Consequences of the Construction of a
Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Advisory Opinion, ICJ
Reports 2004 136, para. 159 (2004). View all notes The status of the
obligation in article 41(1) to cooperate to bring an end to a violation
of a jus cogens norm is still developing.108 The commentaries note that
it may be open to question whether general international law at present
prescribes a positive duty of cooperation and observes that article
41(1) in that respect may reflect the progressive development of
international law (at page 114). View all notes However, the fact that
special rules have been recognised for this category of obligation is
significant for an understanding of the wrongfulness or otherwise of
states systematically receiving and relying on information known or
suspected to have been obtained by torture. In such cases, the threshold
for international responsibility can be seen to have been lowered based
on the importance of the values at stake. **[Third basis: states have a
primary obligation to refrain from action which exposes people to a risk
of torture, wherever it occurs A third potential basis for a more
stringent approach arises not from ideas of complicity in another\'s
act, but rather from a primary obligation on states, inherent in the
prohibition of torture itself, to refrain from action which exposes a
person to a serious risk of torture]{.underline}**.109 This principle is
shown clearly in the rule prohibiting the transfer of persons from one
state to another where there is a real risk that they will be subject to
torture, known as the non-refoulement obligation.110 For a general
overview see Cordula Droege, 'Transfers of Detainees: Legal Framework,
Non-refoulement and Contemporary Challenges', International Review of
the Red Cross 90 (2008): 670--6. **[This rule is found explicitly in
article 3 of the Convention against Torture, and has been read in to
other human rights treaties]{.underline}**, even where not specifically
referred to.111 Importantly, the obligation is seen not to arise from
the state\'s obligation to prevent torture (which could arguably be
limited territorially112 See, for example, Milanović, Extraterritorial
Application, 209--10. View all notes ), but directly from the
prohibition of torture itself.113 Soering, para. 91. Report of the
Special Rapporteur on Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading
Treatment or Punishment, UN Doc. A/59/324 (2004), para. 28: '\[t\]he
principle of non-refoulement is an inherent part of the overall absolute
and imperative nature of the prohibition of torture and other forms of
ill-treatment'. View all notes **[The principle is distinct from the
concept of derivative responsibility for complicity in another\'s
wrongful act]{.underline}**, because the liability does not arise as a
result of torture actually being carried out. **[Rather, to the extent
that liability is or may be incurred, 'it is liability incurred by the
extraditing...State by reason of its having taken action which has as a
direct consequence the exposure of an individual to proscribed
ill-treatment'.]{.underline}**114 Soering, para. 91. See also Aust,
Complicity, 396. Compare with the Court of Appeal\'s objection in the
Ahmed case that the 'wider concepts of complicity' could lead to a
situation where complicity in torture could be found even where the
torture had not taken place (at para. 46). View all notes **[Given its
basis in the prohibition of torture itself, it has been argued that the
non-refoulement obligation is a specific manifestation of a more general
principle that states must ensure that their actions]{.underline}**
(whether by extradition or otherwise**[) do not expose a person to a
substantial risk of torture anywhere in the world.]{.underline}**115

#### No instance of torture is morally permissible -- utilitarian logic uniquely produces a bad form of ethics which disregards victims -- only the aff draws a line defining acceptable actions in the face of torture

**[Perhaps the first response one might make to the above arguments is
to meet utilitarian considerations with deontological
ones]{.underline}**. **[Rather than accepting that torture is like an
economic transaction]{.underline}**, where we trade one life for many
others, **[one might emphasize a position typically associated with
Kant: namely]{.underline}**, **[the view that the respect of a given
individual is inviolable]{.underline}**, **[and is not the sort of thing
that has a \"price.\"]{.underline}** **[Objects can be traded according
to equivalences; human beings, however, cannot]{.underline}**. **[The
problem with the ticking-bomb argument]{.underline}**, every Kantian
will insist, **[lies with the model of torture]{.underline}** (and of
ethical thinking and agency) **[that it presupposes]{.underline}**.
**[The numbers game ignores the individual dignity and autonomy of the
agents subject to its analysis]{.underline}**. Although there are
powerful arguments against the economic model of ethical analysis, and
hence of a defense of torture along economic lines, it is important in
the current con-text to see if the argument above works given economic
assump-tions. **[If the argument can be shown to be lacking even when we
reason within economic parameters]{.underline}** (with the conception of
torture as mere transaction)**[, its rejection will prove all the more
decisive.]{.underline}** Thus, despite our own predilection to accept
the Kantian conception of the person, to combat the ticking-bomb
argument requires thinking about torture on the economic model that is
the basis of the argument, at least if we prefer to avoid a stand-off of
moral intuitions. Artificial Cases Objection **[The other immediate
response often offered by those confronted with the ticking-bomb
argument typically involves pointing out how deeply artificial the case
is.]{.underline}** This objection is forcefully raised in Henry Shue\'s
classic paper, \"Torture\"9: **[There is a saying in jurisprudence that
hard cases make bad law]{.underline}**, **[and there might well be one
in philosophy that artificial cases make bad ethics]{.underline}** . . .
**[Notice how unlike the circum-stances of an actual choice about
torture the philosopher\'s example]{.underline}** ix The proposed victim
of our torture is not someone we suspect of planting the device: he is
the perpetrator. He is not some pitiful psychotic making one last play
for attention: he did plant the device. The wiring is not backwards, the
mechanism is not jammed: the device will destroy the city if not
deactivated. (142) As Shue makes clear**[, the ticking-bomb case is
practically beyond belief.]{.underline}** In addition to the above
problems, we must also know how to torture the perpetrator, that torture
will be effective, that it will not take more time than is available,
and so on**[. But the artificiality of the ticking-bomb case is in fact
worse than any of this suggests: if we know that the bomb is wired
cor-rectly, and that this perpetrator is guilty of placing this bomb
where it is, we must have acquired this knowledge in some
way]{.underline}**. **[How could we have the knowledge in question---a
certainty that makes torture permissible]{.underline}**---unless we saw
the bomb being wired, and then saw this perpetrator place it? If we have
seen these sure on agents along with sleep deprivation and other
tactics, but that we cannot inflict harsh physical pain on such agents,
we (perhaps inadvertently) legitimate the use of all and any tech-niques
that are perhaps just below the level of torture. If it is considered
torture to keep someone awake for 20 hours, and hence is regarded as
illegitimate, this position might lead persons to subject others to 19
hours and 59 minutes of sleep depriva-tion. **[The thought here is that
establishing actual policies will show persons where the line is, so
that they can approach it more frequently with impunity.°]{.underline}**

[It may have once been the case that being attacked by another country
was a major threat to the lives of ordinary people]{.underline}. It may
also be true that there are still some pretty serious dangers out there
associated with the spread of nuclear weapons. For the most part,
however, most of [what you've been told about national security and all
the big threats which can supposedly kill you is one big con designed to
distract you from the things that can really hurt you]{.underline}, such
as the [poverty, inequality and structural violence of
capitalism]{.underline}, global warming, and the manufacture and
proliferation of weapons -- among others. [The facts are simple and
irrefutable: you're far more likely to die from]{.underline} lack of
health care provision than you are from terrorism; from stress and
overwork than Iranian or North Korean nuclear missiles; from lack of
road safety than from illegal immigrants; from mental illness and
suicide than from computer hackers; from domestic violence than from
asylum seekers; from [the misuse of legal medicines and alcohol abuse
than from international drug lords]{.underline}. And yet, [politicians
and the servile media spend most of their time talking about the threats
posed by]{.underline} terrorism, immigration, asylum seekers, the
international drug trade, the [nuclear programmes]{.underline} of Iran
and North Korea, computer hackers, animal rights activism, [the threat
of
China](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-model-for-a-future-war-fans-tensions-with-china-and-inside-pentagon/2012/08/01/gJQAC6F8PX_story.html?wpisrc=emailtoafriend),
[and a host of other issues which are all about as equally unlikely to
affect]{.underline} the health and [well-being of you and your
family]{.underline}. Along with this obsessive and perennial discussion
of so-called 'national security issues', [the state spends truly vast
sums on security measures which have [virtually no impact on the
actual](http://www.hsaj.org/?fullarticle=7.1.16) risk of dying from
these threats, and then engages in]{.underline} massive displays of
'[security theatre]{.underline}' [designed to show just how seriously
the state takes these threats]{.underline} -- such as the x-ray machines
and security measures in every public building, surveillance cameras
everywhere, missile launchers in urban areas, drones in Afghanistan,
armed police in airports, and a thousand other things. [This display is
meant to convince you that these threats are really, really
serious]{.underline}. And while all this is going on, [the rulers of
society are hoping that you won't notice that increasing social and
economic inequality in society leads to increased ill health for a
growing underclass]{.underline}; that suicide and crime always rise when
unemployment rises; that workplaces remain highly dangerous and kill and
maim hundreds of people per year; that there are preventable diseases
which plague the poorer sections of society; that domestic violence
kills and injures thousands of women and children annually; [and that
globally, poverty and preventable disease kills tens of millions of
people needlessly every year]{.underline}. In other words, [they are
hoping that you won't notice how much [structural
violence](http://www.structuralviolence.org/structural-violence) there
is in the world]{.underline}. More than this, [they are hoping that you
won't notice that while literally trillions of dollars are spent on
military weapons]{.underline}, foreign wars and security theatre (which
also arguably do nothing to make any us any safer, and may even make us
marginally less safe), [that domestic violence programmes struggle to
provide even minimal support for women and children at risk of serious
harm]{.underline} from their partners; that underfunded mental health
programmes mean long waiting lists to receive basic care for at-risk
individuals; that drug and alcohol rehabilitation programmes lack the
funding to match the demand for help; that welfare measures aimed at
reducing inequality have been inadequate for decades; [that health and
safety measures at many workplaces remain insufficiently
resourced]{.underline}; and that measures to tackle global warming and
developing alternative energy remain hopelessly inadequate. Of course,
none of this is surprising. [[Politicians are a part of the system; they
don't want to change
it]{.underline}.](https://richardjacksonterrorismblog.wordpress.com/2012/08/05/2012/07/10/politics-politicians-and-other-reasons-to-stop-voting/)
For them, [all the insecurity, death and ill-health caused by capitalist
inequality are a price worth paying to keep the basic social structures
as they are]{.underline}. A more egalitarian society based on equality,
solidarity, and other non-materialist values would not suit their
interests, or the special interests of the lobby groups they are
indebted to. It is also true that [dealing with economic and social
inequality]{.underline}, improving public health, changing international
structures of inequality, restructuring the military-industrial complex,
and making the necessary economic and political changes to deal with
global warming will be extremely difficult and [will require long-term
commitment and determination]{.underline}. For politicians looking
towards the next election, it is clearly much easier to paint immigrants
as a threat to social order or pontificate about the ongoing danger of
terrorists. It is also more exciting for the media than stories about
how poor people and people of colour are discriminated against and
suffer worse health as a consequence. Viewed from this vantage point,
[national security is one massive confidence trick]{.underline} --
misdirection on an epic scale. [Its primary function is to distract you
from the structures and inequalities in society which are the real
threat to the health]{.underline} and wellbeing [of you and your family,
and to convince you to be permanently afraid]{.underline} so that you
will acquiesce to all the security measures which keep you under state
control and keep the military-industrial complex ticking along. [Keep
this in mind next time you hear a politician talking about the threat
of]{.underline} uncontrolled immigration, the risk posed by asylum
seekers or [the threat of Iran]{.underline}, or the need to expand
counter-terrorism powers. The question is: when politicians are talking
about national security, what is that they don't want you to think and
talk about? What exactly is the misdirection they are engaged in? The
truth is, [if you think that terrorists or immigrants or asylum seekers
or Iran are a greater threat to your safety than the capitalist system,
you have been well and truly conned]{.underline}, my friend. Don't
believe the hype: [you're much more likely to die from any one of
several forms of structural violence in society than you are from
immigrants or terrorism]{.underline}. Somehow, [we need to challenge the
politicians on this fact.]{.underline}

Playing with Wild Cards Without doubt, simulations \-- including
nonstandard ones \-- can aid planning. The question is: To what end? And
to what effect? Exploring \"wild cards\" in order to identify warning
signs or to define limits is one thing; using them to establish force
structure or modernization requirements, quite another. Especially
suspect would be using scenarios that are detached from declared US
interests to define current requirements; this would put the military
\"cart\" before the political \"horse.\" Another, broader concern is how
the effusion of improbable conflict scenarios affects public policy
discourse overall. [Conflict scenarios]{.underline}, both wild and tame,
can [gain more credibility]{.underline} in the telling [than they
deserve. Cognitive researcher]{.underline} Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini
[calls this the \"Othello effect,\" referring to the trail of
**plausible but false suppositions**]{.underline} that led Othello to
murder his wife, Desdemona. [Even the **most farfetched** scenarios
comprise a number of]{.underline} steps or [links]{.underline} each of
[which may seem]{.underline} plausible or even [probable given the
one]{.underline} that came [before. Although the likelihood of the
scenario **dwindles with each step**, the]{.underline} residual
[impression is one of plausibility. Omitted are the many branches at
each step that would lead to a neutral]{.underline} or even positive
[outcome]{.underline}. The [resulting **snapshots**]{.underline},
although numerous, [offer a **highly-selective view**]{.underline} of
what the future may hold. And [the fact that only]{.underline} the
[negative outcomes are articulated]{.underline} and exercised [can
distort the]{.underline} general public [impression of
risk]{.underline}. Living with Uncertainty There is no escape from
uncertainty, but there is relief from uncertainty hysteria. It begins
with recognizing that instability has boundaries \-- just as turbulence
in physical systems has discernable onset points and parameters. The
turbulence of a river, for instance, corresponds to flow and to the
contours of the river\'s bed and banks. It occurs in patches and not
randomly. The weather also is a chaotic system that resists precise
long-range forecasting, but allows useful prediction of broader trends
and limits. Despite uncertainty, [statements of probability
matter]{.underline}. They indicate the weight of evidence \-- or whether
there is any evidence at all. The [uncertainty hawks]{.underline} would
[flood our concern with a **horde of dangers** that pass their
permissive test of \"non-zero probability.\"]{.underline} However, [by
**lowering the threshold**]{.underline} of alarm, [they establish an
**impossible** standard]{.underline} of defense sufficiency: absolute
and certain military security. Given finite resources and competing
ends, something less will have to do. [Strategic wisdom begins
with]{.underline} the [setting]{.underline} of priorities \-- and
priorities demand [strict attention to what appears likely and **what
does not**]{.underline}.

#### Extinction first logic fails -- especially in the context of long internal link chains

the University of Bielefeld, and professor of history and theory of IR

Uncertainty: Risk and the Paradox of Security Politics" p. 211-232)

The problem of the second method is that [it is very difficult to
\"calculate\"]{.underline} politically [unacceptable
losses]{.underline}. [If]{.underline} the [risk]{.underline} of
terrorism [is defined]{.underline} in traditional terms [by]{.underline}
probability and [potential loss, then]{.underline} the [focus on
dramatic]{.underline} terror [attacks leads to]{.underline} the
**[marginalization of probabilities]{.underline}**. The reason is that
[even the highest degree of improbability **becomes irrelevant** as the
measure of loss goes to infinity]{.underline}.\^o [The]{.underline}
mathematical [calculation of the risk]{.underline} of terrorism thus
[tends to overestimate and]{.underline} to [dramatize]{.underline} the
[danger]{.underline}. [This has consequences beyond]{.underline} the
actual [risk assessment for the formulation]{.underline} and execution
[of \"risk policies\"]{.underline}: [If one factor]{.underline} of the
risk calculation [approaches infinity]{.underline} (e.g., if a case of
nuclear terrorism is envisaged), then [there is no balanced
measure]{.underline} for antiterrorist efforts, [and **risk management
as a rational endeavor breaks down**]{.underline}. Under the historical
condition of bipolarity, the \"ultimate\" threat with nuclear weapons
could be balanced by a similar counterthreat, and new equilibria could
be achieved, albeit on higher levels of nuclear overkill.
[Under]{.underline} the new condition of [uncertainty, no]{.underline}
such [rational balancing is possible since knowledge]{.underline} about
actors, their motives and capabilities, [is largely absent]{.underline}.
The second form of [security policy]{.underline} that emerges when the
deterrence model collapses mirrors the \"social probability\" approach.
It [represents a **logic of catastrophe**]{.underline}. [In contrast to
risk]{.underline} management [framed]{.underline} in line [with logical
probability]{.underline} theory, [the logic of catastrophe does not
attempt to provide means of absorbing uncertainty]{.underline}. Rather,
[it takes uncertainty as constitutive for]{.underline} the
[logic]{.underline} itself; [uncertainty is a]{.underline} crucial
[precondition for catastrophes]{.underline}. In particular, catastrophes
happen at once, [without]{.underline} a [warning]{.underline}, but with
major implications for the world polity. In this category, [we
find]{.underline} the impact of [meteorites]{.underline}. Mars attacks,
the tsunami in [South East Asia, and 9/11]{.underline}. [To conceive
of]{.underline} terrorism as [catastrophe has consequences
for]{.underline} the [formulation of]{.underline} an [adequate security
policy]{.underline}. Since [catastrophes hap-pen irrespectively of human
activity]{.underline} or inactivity, [**no political action**
could]{.underline} possibly [prevent them]{.underline}. Of course, there
are precautions that can be taken, but [the framing of]{.underline}
terrorist attack as [a catastrophe points to spatial and temporal
characteristics that are beyond \"rationality.\" Thus]{.underline},
political [decision makers are exempt]{.underline}ed [from the
responsibility to provide security]{.underline}---as long as they at
least try to preempt an attack. Interestingly enough, 9/11 was framed as
catastrophe in various commissions dealing with the question of who was
responsible and whether it could have been prevented. This makes clear
that under the condition of uncertainty, there are no objective criteria
that could serve as an anchor for measuring dangers and assessing the
quality of political responses. For ex- ample, as much as one might
object to certain measures by the US administration, it is almost
impossible to \"measure\" the success of countermeasures. Of course,
there might be a subjective assessment of specific shortcomings or
failures, but there is no \"common\" currency to evaluate them. As a
consequence, [the framework of]{.underline} the [security]{.underline}
dilemma [fails to capture]{.underline} the [basic
uncertainties]{.underline}. Pushing the door open for the security
paradox, the main problem of security analysis then becomes the question
how to integrate dangers in risk assessments and security policies about
which simply nothing is known. In the mid 1990s, a Rand study entitled
\"New Challenges for Defense Planning\" addressed this issue arguing
that \"most striking is the fact that [we do not]{.underline} even
[know]{.underline} who or what will constitute [the most serious future
threat]{.underline}, \"\^i [In order to cope]{.underline} with this
challenge it would be essential, another Rand researcher wrote, to break
free from [the]{.underline} \"tyranny\" of plausible scenario planning.
The decisive [step would be to create \"discontinuous scenarios \... in
which there is **no plausible**]{.underline} audit
**[trail]{.underline}** or storyline from current events\"52 These
nonstandard scenarios were later called \"wild cards\" and became
important in the current US strategic discourse. They justified the
transformation from a threat-based toward a capability- based defense
planning strategy.53 The problem with this kind of risk assessment is,
however, that [even the most **absurd scenarios**]{.underline} can [gain
plausibility]{.underline}. [By constructing a **chain of
potentialities**, improbable events are linked and brought
into]{.underline} the realm of [the possible, if not]{.underline} even
the [probable]{.underline}. \"[Although]{.underline} the
[likelihood]{.underline} of the scenario [dwindles with each step,
the]{.underline} residual [impression is]{.underline} one [of
plausibility]{.underline}. \"54 This so-called Othello effect has been
effective in the dawn of the recent war in Iraq. [The connection between
Saddam]{.underline} Hussein [and Al Qaeda]{.underline} that the US
government tried to prove [was disputed from the]{.underline} very
[beginning. False evidence was]{.underline} again and again [presented
and refuted, but this did not prevent the]{.underline} administration
from presenting as the main rationale for war the [improbable yet
possible connection]{.underline} between Iraq and the terrorist network
and the improbable yet possible proliferation of an improbable yet
possible nuclear weapon into the hands of Bin Laden. As Donald Rumsfeld
famously said: \"**[Absence of evidence is not evidence of
absence]{.underline}**.\" This sentence indicates that under the
condition of genuine uncertainty, different evidence criteria prevail
than in situations where security problems can be assessed with relative
certainty.

Jerusalem, June 23, "Why It's No Longer Possible for Any Country to Win
a War" <http://time.com/4826856/russia-trump-north-korea-china-war/>)

**[The last few decades have been the most peaceful era in human
history.]{.underline}** For the first time ever, **[fewer people die
today from human violence than from traffic accidents, obesity or even
suicide]{.underline}**. Whereas in early agricultural societies human
violence caused up to 15% of all human deaths, and in the twentieth
century it caused 5%, today it is responsible for only about 1%. Yet the
international climate is rapidly deteriorating; warmongering is back in
vogue, and military expenditure is ballooning**[. Both laypeople and
experts fear that just as in 1914 the murder of an Austrian archduke
sparked the First World War, in 2017 some incident in the Syrian Desert
or an unwise move in the Korean Peninsula might ignite a global
conflict]{.underline}**. Yet **[there are several key differences
between 2017 and 1914. Back then, war had great appeal to elites across
the world because they had concrete examples for how successful wars
contribute to economic success and political power]{.underline}**. Now,
**[successful wars seem to be an endangered species.]{.underline}** From
the days of Assyria and Rome, great empires were usually built through
war, and elites in 1914 had plenty of recent examples for the huge
profits a successful war can bring. In 1846--48 the United States
invaded Mexico, and for the price of 13,000 dead American soldiers, it
got California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico and parts of Colorado,
Kansas, Wyoming and Oklahoma. It was the bargain of the millennium.
Similarly, imperial Japan cherished its victories over China and Russia;
Germany glorified its triumph over France; and almost every great power
had a string of splendid little colonial wars to its name. When France,
Britain or Italy contemplated putting boots on the ground in Vietnam,
Nigeria or Libya, their main fear was that somebody else might get there
first. **[In 2017, global elites don't know what a successful war even
looks like]{.underline}**. They may have read about them in history
books and seen fanciful recreations in Hollywood blockbusters, but
**[they have good reason to suspect that this type of war has gone
extinct.]{.underline}** **[Though some third-world dictators and
non-state actors still manage to flourish through war, it seems that
major powers no longer know how to do so. The greatest victory in living
memory --- of the United States over the Soviet Union --- was achieved
without any major military confrontation]{.underline}**. The U.S. then
got a fleeting taste of old-fashioned military glory in the First Gulf
War --- which only tempted it to waste trillions on humiliating military
fiascos in Iraq and Afghanistan. **[China, the rising power of the early
twenty-first century, has assiduously avoided all armed
conflicts]{.underline}** since its Vietnamese debacle of 1979, and it
owes its ascent strictly to economic factors. In this, it has emulated
not the Japanese and German empires of the pre-1914 era, but rather the
nonviolent Japanese and German economic miracles of the post-1945 era.
**[Even in the Middle East, regional powers don't know how to wage
successful]{.underline}** **[wars]{.underline}**. **[Iran gained nothing
from the long bloodbath of the Iran-Iraq War and subsequently avoided
all direct military confrontations.]{.underline}** It became regional
hegemon by default, as its two main enemies --- the U.S. and Iraq ---
got embroiled in a war that destroyed both Iraq and the American
appetite for Middle Eastern quagmires. Much the same can be said of
Israel, which waged its last successful war fifty years ago. Since 1967,
**[Israel has prospered despite its many wars, not thanks to
them]{.underline}**. Its conquered territories are a heavy economic
burden and a crippling political liability. Like Iran, Israel has
recently improved its geopolitical position not by waging successful
wars, but by avoiding getting sucked into the wars that devastated Iraq,
Syria and Libya. **[The only recent successful war waged by a major
power has been the Russian conquest of the Crimea. However, it was made
possible by an extraordinary set of circumstances:]{.underline}** **[The
Ukrainian army showed no resistance; other powers refrained from
intervening; and the Crimean population either supported the invaders or
peacefully accepted the conquest as a fait accompli]{.underline}**.
These circumstances will be hard to reproduce. If the precondition for a
successful war is the absence of any enemies willing to resist, it
limits the available opportunities. **[Indeed, when Russia sought to
reproduce its Crimean success in other parts of the Ukraine, it
encountered substantially stiffer opposition, and the war in eastern
Ukraine bogged down into an unproductive stalemate.]{.underline}**
Conquering decrepit Soviet-era factories in Luhansk and Donetsk hardly
pays for the war, and it certainly does not offset the costs of
international sanctions. The conquest of Crimea notwithstanding, it
seems that **[in the twenty-first century the most successful strategy
is to keep your peace and let others do the fighting for you. Why has it
become so difficult for major powers to wage successful wars? One reason
is the change in the nature of the economy.]{.underline}** In the past,
**[if you defeated your enemy on the battlefield, you could easily cash
in by looting enemy cities, selling enemy civilians in the slave markets
and occupying valuable wheat fields and gold mines. Yet in the
twenty-first century, only puny profits could be made that
way.]{.underline}** Today, **[the main economic assets consist of
technical and institutional knowledge --- and you cannot conquer
knowledge through war.]{.underline}** An organization such as ISIS may
flourish by looting cities and oil wells in the Middle East --- in 2014,
ISIS seized more than \$500 million from Iraqi banks and in 2015 made an
additional \$500 million from selling oil. But **[China and the U.S. are
unlikely to start a war for a paltry billion. As for spending trillions
of dollars on a war against the U.S., how could China repay these
expenses and balance all the war damages and lost trade opportunities?
Would the victorious People's Liberation Army loot the riches of Silicon
Valley?]{.underline}** True, corporations such as Apple, Facebook and
Google are worth hundreds of billions of dollars, but you cannot seize
these fortunes by force. There are no silicon mines in Silicon Valley.
**[A successful war could theoretically still bring huge profits by
enabling the victor to rearrange the global trade system in its
favor]{.underline}**, as the U.S. did after its victory over Hitler.
However**[, present-day military technology would make it extremely
difficult to repeat this feat.]{.underline}** By definition, **[profits
large enough to make a global war worthwhile for the victor will also
make it worthwhile for the loser to resort to weapons of mass
destruction.]{.underline}** **[The atom bomb has turned "victory" in a
World War into collective suicide]{.underline}**. It is no coincidence
that since Hiroshima **[superpowers never fought one another directly,
and engaged only in what]{.underline}** (for them) **[were low-stake
conflicts in which none was tempted to use nuclear weapons to avert
defeat]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[even attacking a second-rate nuclear
power]{.underline}** such as Iran or North Korea **[is an extremely
unattractive proposition. Cyber warfare makes things even worse for
would-be imperialists]{.underline}**. As recently as the days of George
W. Bush, the U.S. could wreak havoc in far-off Fallujah while the Iraqis
had no means of retaliating against San Francisco. But **[if the U.S.
now attacks a country possessing even moderate cyber warfare
capabilities, malware and logic bombs could stop air traffic in Dallas,
cause trains to collide in Philadelphia and bring down the electric grid
in Michigan]{.underline}**. In the great age of conquerors, warfare was
a low-damage, high-profit affair. At the battle of Hastings in 1066,
William the Conqueror gained the whole of England in a single day for
the cost of a few thousand dead. **[Nuclear weapons and cyber
warfare]{.underline}**, by contrast**[, are high-damage, low-profit
technologies. You could use such tools to destroy entire countries, but
not to build profitable empires.]{.underline}** Hence in a world filling
up with saber-rattling and bad vibes, perhaps **[our best guarantee of
peace is that major powers aren't familiar with any recent example of a
successful war]{.underline}**. While Genghis Khan or Julius Caesar would
invade a foreign country at the drop of a hat, **[present-day strongmen
talk loud but are very careful about actually launching
wars]{.underline}**. Of course, if somebody does find a formula to wage
successful wars under twenty-first-century conditions, the gates of hell
might open with a rush. This is what makes the Russian success in the
Crimea a particularly frightening omen. Let's hope it remains an
isolated example. Though, even if it is impossible to wage successful
wars in the twenty-first century, that does not give us an absolute
guarantee for peace. We should never underestimate human stupidity.

#### Trump irrationality makes other powers initiating conflict or escalating [highly unlikely]{.underline}

**Jakobsen 17** (Peter, March 2. Associate Professor at the Royal Danish
Defence College and a Professor (part-time) at the Center for War
Studies at University of Southern Denmark.

**[This concern is massively overblown]{.underline}**. **[Rather than
weakening America's web of alliances, Trump's aggressive statements and
erratic behavior will most likely strengthen the American-led security
architecture during his presidency. This is good news for world peace
because strong American alliances and strong American allies can deter
rivals from launching destabilizing challenges to the predominant order.
Trump's aggressive communications strategy and his "America First"
approach to international negotiations have already frightened allies
into doing something his predecessors could not: increase defense
spending. Fear of abandonment has changed the nature of the defense
debate in allied capitals in Asia and Europe. The question is no longer
whether defense spending should increase, but how much. U.S. allies in
Europe are now scrambling to produce concrete plans for how they will
increase defense spending in time for President Trump's first visit to
NATO in late May 2017.. His perceived unpredictability is also making
military provocations and risk-taking by America's adversaries less
likely]{.underline}**. Trumpology is Misleading The concern triggered by
Trump's election stems in no small part from the rise of what I call
"Trumpology" -- the incessant scrutiny of Trump's personality, his
statements, and his tweets. Trumpology is a new growth industry and the
media embraces it because it fits their definition of a newsworthy story
perfectly. Trump's communications generate all the criteria journalists
look for in a good story: conflict, anxiety, comedy, theater, and
outrage. This helps media companies, even those attacked by Trump, sell
advertising like hotcakes. Many experts now spend their time putting
Trump's words under the microscope, seeking to identify all the
disasters they might create. In addition, psychologists have been busy
analyzing his personality and upbringing in order to explain why he is
acting so weird. The American intelligence community has used
personality profiling since World War II to better understand how
leaders in closed authoritarian systems such as Iraq, Iran, North Korea,
and Russia think and act. The results have been useful on occasion, but
the study of personalities and intentions is insufficient with respect
to predicting foreign policy actions and outcomes. One must also analyze
the consequences and the opposition that proposed actions are likely to
generate. If one considers the consequences of undermining existing U.S.
alliances and how much opposition such action would trigger, one gets a
far more positive picture of Trump's impact on world security than the
doomsday scenarios that Trumpologists have mass-produced since his
election. Consequences for U.S. Allies Since the late 1940s, U.S. allies
in Europe and Asia have based their national security on the assumption
that the United States will assist them in a crisis. This assumption and
the post-Cold War downsizing of Europe's military forces have rendered
Europeans incapable of conducting even relatively small-scale military
operations without substantial American support. NATO's air war against
Libya (2011) and the French intervention in Mali (2013) are two recent
cases in point. Neither operation would have been possible without
American logistics, lift, munitions, intelligence, and other forms of
support. The situation in the same in Asia: Australia, Japan, New
Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan have all based their defense
forces and defense spending on the assumption that the U.S. cavalry will
come to their rescue if necessary. If Trump degrades or withdraws these
security guarantees, the allies will face a stark choice between
deterrence and appeasement. In Europe deterrence is the most likely
choice because the big three (Germany, France, and the United Kingdom)
are strong enough to constitute the core of a new alliance that can
credibly deter Russia. In Asia, China will become so strong that most
states bordering the East China Sea will have no choice but to appease
Beijing and accept its hegemony. Regardless of the outcome, both Europe
and Asia would face a period characterized by high instability and a
heightened risk of war. Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan would seek to
develop nuclear weapons. In Europe, Germany and Poland would have a
strong incentive to do the same unless France and Britain extend their
nuclear umbrellas over them. Indeed, all of these countries, except
Poland, either contemplated the development of nuclear weapons (Germany
and Japan) or had active nuclear weapons programs during the Cold War
(South Korea and Taiwan). Consequences for the United States Prominent
American scholars such as John Mearsheimer, Barry Posen, and Stephen
Walt have long recommended that the United States withdraw most of its
forces from Asia and Europe because the costs of the existing onshore
presence dwarf the benefits. In their view, the existing security
guarantees amount to "welfare for the rich" and increase the risk of
entrapment in wars that do not involve American national interests. They
believe that the United States would be much better off by copying the
offshore balancing strategy that the British Empire employed in Europe
before World War II. This would involve providing support to shifting
alliances and coalitions in order to prevent a single power from
establishing a regional hegemony on the European continent. Offshore
balancing has clear limitations and did not serve the British well in
the end: it threw them into two world wars that brought the empire to
its knees. Britain's fate highlights the weakness of offshore balancing:
a loss of the ability to shape the security politics onshore decisively.
The failure of British offshore balancing dragged the United States into
both world wars. America's decisions to help its allies in Europe defeat
Germany proved costly in blood and treasure. Since then the United
States has benefitted tremendously from the onshore balancing strategy
it adopted after World War II in both Asia and Europe, where it
stationed its forces permanently to deter aggression. This presence,
coupled with the allies' military dependence, enabled Washington to
shape development in both regions to align with U.S. interests.
Washington repeatedly gave their allies offers they could not refuse.
U.S. economic assistance programs provided to allies in the wake of
World War II came with conditions that forced the recipients to buy
American goods and liberalize their markets in ways that were highly
beneficial to American firms. Washington forced Great Britain and France
to withdraw their troops from Egypt during the Suez Crisis (1956),
coerced Germany to support U.S. monetary policy (1966 to 1969), and
leaned on many allies to stop their nuclear weapons programs and join
the Non-Proliferation Treaty (1968) that made such weapons illegal,
including Japan, Germany, South Korea, and Taiwan. Military dependence
on the United States also induced many allies to support U.S.-led wars
in faraway places that did not affect their national security directly.
The Afghan War and Iraq War are two recent cases in point. The allies
closed their eyes to issues like secret detention and extraordinary
rendition programs, the use of torture, and the massive surveillance of
their own citizens that has characterized the War on Terror since 9/11.
Allies have given the United States access to bases, facilities, as well
as their airspace and territorial waters. This facilitates U.S. power
projection globally. Finally, many allies buy American weapon systems as
a way of maintain inter-operability and their security guarantees. The
F-35 is the latest and greatest example of this. The consequences of a
U.S. military withdrawal from Europe and Asia would be dramatic. The
United States would lose most of its military bases in Asia and Europe,
American firms would find it much harder to gain access to Asian and
European markets, the American defense industry would lose billions of
dollars, and European allies would stop supporting the United States
militarily in faraway conflicts. As a result, the United States would
lose its global power status and be reduced to a regional power with
limited say in the management of Asian and European security. This is
why it will not happen. This outcome is not only at odds with America's
economic interests, but it is also completely at odds with the widely
shared belief in American exceptionalism and greatness. This is a belief
that Trump and his supporters also embrace. Most Americans continue to
view their nation as the greatest power on earth with an obligation to
lead and make the world safe for America's universal values. Trump is
Scaring Allies into Spending But if the costs of abandoning allies are
prohibitive, why is Trump threatening to do so? Nobel Prize laureate
Thomas Schelling's work on game theory suggests an answer. Schelling
demonstrated in his seminal Strategy of Conflict (1960) that it may be
advantageous to appear mad or unpredictable, because it may induce your
negotiating partners or opponents to give greater concessions that they
otherwise would. In this perspective, Trump's statements and seemingly
erratic behavior make a lot of sense as a negotiation tactic aimed at
pressuring U.S. allies to increase their defense spending. Trump's
predecessors in the White House have tried to do this for years without
success; previous administrations have repeatedly warned its European
allies that NATO was in danger of becoming irrelevant if the Europeans
continued to cut their defense spending. Yet most European allies paid
scant attention to demands from the Obama administration to stop
freeriding and honor their own commitments to spend 2 percent of GDP on
defense. Few European governments saw a pressing need to increase
defense spending because the Obama administration reacted to the Russian
annexation of the Crimea by enhancing its military presence in Europe.
Trump has changed the game completely. In line with Schelling's
expectations, his perceived unpredictability is adding credibility to
the threat that he might actually withdraw U.S. forces even if it is not
in the United States best interest to do so. There is genuine concern
among U.S. allies about what Trump might do if they do not take
immediate steps to increase their defense spending. Many have already
taken steps in this direction, or signaled their intention to do so. In
December 2016, Japan adopted a record high defense budget, which
allocated considerable funds to the procurement of American equipment,
notably F-35s and missiles. The South Korean government reacted to
Trump's election by vowing to increase defense spending significantly if
he insists on it. Likewise, the Danish Prime Minister Lars Loekke
Rasmussen promised to increase defense spending after his first phone
conversation with Trump. In Germany Trump's election triggered a
hitherto unthinkable debate on whether Germany should develop nuclear
weapons. Trump cannot take sole credit for the newfound allied
attentiveness to longstanding U.S. demands. The Japanese defense budget
has been increasing in recent years due to growing concerns about China.
Russia has had a similar effect on the defense budgets of the eastern
NATO members. However, Trump has made a crucial difference by completely
changing the debate on defense spending in allied capitals,
significantly strengthening the hands of the proponents of increased
defense spending in allied governments. The 2016 IHS Jane's Defence
Budgets Report consequently expects European NATO allies and partners
such as Finland and Sweden to boost their defense spending by about \$10
billion over the next five years. **[Trump's Unpredictability Deters
Rival Risk-Taking]{.underline}** That Schelling's **[logic applies
equally well to President Trump's dealings with America's
opponents]{.underline}** has already been pointed out by other
commentators. They have referred to Nixon's madman theory of
negotiation, which holds that **[America's opponents will tread more
carefully if they perceive the president to be unpredictable or crazy.
It has been debated at some length whether Trump is using this theory in
a rational manner to extract concessions from U.S. adversaries, or if he
is "a madman in practice." Regardless, the point is that President
Trump's unpredictability makes it next to impossible to calculate the
risk of escalation involved in challenging the United States militarily,
a concept also highlighted by Schelling. President Obama's reluctance to
threaten and use force likely emboldened China and Russia to take
greater military risks in Eastern Ukraine, Syria, and in the East and
South China Seas. While Beijing and Moscow could be fairly confident
that Obama would not take military counter-measures, they have no way of
knowing what President Trump might do. It is very easy to imagine him
giving the order to down a Chinese or Russian plane to demonstrate that
"America is great again." In this way, Trump (intentionally or not)
reduces the risk of military confrontations with China and Russia. This
gives both states greater incentive to prioritize diplomacy over
coercion in their efforts to settle disputes with the United States and
its allies. Similarly, Trump's characterization of the nuclear agreement
with Iran as "the worst deal ever negotiated" gives Tehran strong
incentive to honor it in both letter and spirit for fear of a
potentially much worse alternative if it collapses. Some are deeply
worried that Trump versus Kim Jong-un will prove a highly explosive
combination, which is understandable since North Korea has employing the
same negotiating tactics as Trump for decades with considerable success.
While the outcome of this confrontation is difficult to call, the
disastrous consequences of war are likely to lead to mutual restraint.
Moreover, concern about what Trump might do will induce Beijing to
redouble its efforts to persuade Pyongyang to be less
provocative]{.underline}**. Good News for World Peace Paradoxically,
**[Trump's]{.underline}** tweets and the **[theatrics are most likely to
enhance world peace. They create unpredictability and anxiety that the
United States can use to obtain greater concessions from friends and
foes]{.underline}**. It is admittedly still early days, but all
indications are that Trump will succeed in coercing his allies in both
Asia and Europe to increase their defense spending significantly. Few of
them will reach 2 percent of GDP in the next year or two, but he has set
in motion a process that will make most allies spend far more much
faster than they otherwise would have. **[His unpredictability is also
an asset in America's dealings with its opponents such as China, Iran,
North Korea, and Russia. They will all need to think twice about
provoking the United States and its allies militarily because they have
no way of calculating how President Trump will react. Neither friends
nor foes can be certain that Trump will not do something that a rational
cost-benefit calculating actor would not]{.underline}**. U.S. allies
used to regard American threats to withdraw its forces as bluff because
the costs of doing so would be prohibitive, and **[the same logic has
induced American opponents to engage in military risk-taking with little
fear of U.S. military retaliation. With Trump in the White House, this
logic no longer applies. This is good news because the likely result is
strengthened U.S. alliances and U.S. opponents that are more likely to
favor negotiation over provocation in their efforts to settle
differences with the United States and its allies]{.underline}**.

When the president wakes up the military

It is a different matter in the other context: **[when it is the
president who wakes up the military and tries to get them to go from
peacetime to war, i.e. to launch a preventive nuclear
attack.]{.underline}** In the preventive case, it is not reasonable to
believe that the streamlined procedures of an emergency response would
operate without anyone raising objections. **[The steps the president
would have to take in order to pass a nuclear order to someone who could
physically launch the missiles would simultaneously alert the rest of
his national security team]{.underline}**. **[Efforts to bypass the
senior leadership]{.underline}** **[would]{.underline}** themselves
further **[alarm subordinates]{.underline}**, **[increasing the
likelihood that they would draw in the rest of the national security
team, even if ordered not to]{.underline}**. **[The military is trained
to reject illegal orders and the president trying to order the military
to go from peacetime to nuclear war without consulting with his national
security advisors would set off alarms up and down the system about
whether the orders were legal]{.underline}**. **[The
president]{.underline}** does not need anyone else to help him fire off
a tweet, but he **[does need many others to help him fire off a nuclear
intercontinental ballistic missile]{.underline}**. If he were trying to
do so **[it would take an enormous effort of persuasion that would
involve many more people than are involved in the streamlined,
launch-under-attack scenario.]{.underline}** What would happen in this
second scenario? That question led to the second major topic of concern
in the Q&A period: how robust is the military training to resist illegal
orders and how confident could we be that the Pentagon would view an
order to "launch a preventive nuclear war without notifying my national
security team" to be illegal? In testimony, **[General Kehler repeatedly
emphasized that the military does not follow orders blindly and the
ubiquity of lawyers at multiple layers of command gives us high
confidence the legal questions would be asked]{.underline}** (and need
to be answered) **[before a nuclear strike actually
happened.]{.underline}** This is true, though it is also true that the
military are trained that authenticated orders from the national command
authority have a presumption of legality. (Note: the presumption is even
stronger in launch-under-attack scenarios, because the United States has
long embraced the legal concept of anticipatory self-defense, which
could result in a decision to strike under circumstances where the
United States has not yet suffered an attack, but one is deemed to be
imminent or even underway.) Nevertheless, I am inclined to share General
Kehler's confidence **[that a rogue president would find it exceedingly
hard to persuade the military to act in preventive war scenarios as
rapidly as they are trained to act in launch-under-attack
scenarios]{.underline}**. Part of this comes from my understanding of
the civil-military context of national security.
**[Presidents]{.underline}** already **[find it challenging to persuade
the military to embrace policies that the military object
to]{.underline}** --- **[and which are far less consequential than
preventive nuclear war]{.underline}**. Another of my books, Armed
Servants, explores in some detail the push and shove of civil-military
relations. And still a third (co-authored with Chris Gelpi), Choosing
Your Battles, shows that **[the military are hardly chomping at the bit
to initiate the use of force]{.underline}**. To be sure, I also found,
in Guarding the Guardians, that the military did favor a system inclined
to the always rather than the never side of the always/never dilemma.
This is in part why U.S. political leaders insisted that there be
civilian control of the arsenal. Yet all of these policies were the
result of a lengthy bureaucratic struggle that involved many more people
than just the president and the few nuclear operators required to launch
a missile. **[The longer timeline of a preventive war scenario gives the
opportunity for all these actors to weigh in on the president's
decision]{.underline}**. Yes, the president could still carry the day,
as President George W. **[Bush]{.underline}** did **[in
2003]{.underline}** when he ordered the invasion of
**[Iraq]{.underline}** in a similar preventive scenario. But
**[Bush's]{.underline}** **[team spent over a year debating the
decision]{.underline}**. The military weighed in repeatedly. And,
crucially, **[Congress voted to give the president the authority to do
what he did.]{.underline}**

serve.]{.underline}** Wherever it takes place and whatever the stakes
involved, it's simply wrong. In the wake of the September 11 terrorist
attacks, the ICRC actively engaged with the U.S. on issues related to
the treatment of detainees held in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo
Bay. Very early on, we decided to invest in a constructive and sustained
dialogue with the American authorities. Even when discussions were
sometimes tense over the past 12 years, the ICRC's commitment to the
detainees never wavered. We remain committed to visiting them,
monitoring their treatment, connecting them with their families, and
consistently reminding the U.S. of their obligations under international
humanitarian law. Today, our relationship with the government is strong.
**[The bottom line is that decisions taken in Washington resonate across
the globe]{.underline}**. **[The U.S. has a major influence on the world
stage and American]{.underline}** detention **[practices can, for better
or for worse, have an impact on the actions of officials]{.underline}**,
prison directors, guards, **[and interrogators in even the most
far-flung places on the planet. That's why this moment in history offers
an opportunity to reaffirm clearly]{.underline}**, and **[for the whole
world to hear, that torture and ill-treatment are fundamentally
wrong]{.underline}**, **[and that unconditionally rejecting such tactics
--- now and forever --- is the right thing to do.]{.underline}**

International order and the rule of law Member states at the United
Nations (UN) World Summit in 2005 committed to 'actively protecting and
promoting all human rights, the rule of law and democracy', recognising
the 'interlinked and mutually reinforcing' nature of these concepts.7 At
the international level, the rule of law provides an important sense of
stability and pre- dictability in the absence of a centralised world
polity. While definitions of the concept vary, the rule of law might be
conceptualised as entailing four main principles: govern- ments and
other actors are accountable under the law; laws are just and applied
evenly, and protect fundamental rights; the processes by which laws are
enacted and enforced are accessible and fair; and the delivery of
justice is competent and ethical.8 Account- ability under the law and
the equal enforcement of laws protecting basic human rights are
particularly central in enabling states and other actors to maintain
standards of fair behaviour. **[When states fail to comply with their
legal commitments and uphold fun- damental human rights protections, the
principles of accountability, fairness and equal enforcement
underpinning the rule of law are undermined. Moreover, because the
efficacy of international law depends on its successful internalisation
and enforcement among states, widespread violations of international
standards can precipitate a breakdown in global justice]{.underline}**.9
Encroachments on the international rule of law simultaneously encroach
on inter- national order. International order encompasses 'the body of
rules, norms, and institutions that govern relations among the key
players in the international environment'.10 **[Contemporary
international order depends particularly on adherence to liberal
political norms upholding human rights]{.underline}**. Noncompliance
with such norms is often understood as endan- gering human rights and
international stability writ large.11 **[For democracies, human rights
violations can jeopardise the rule of law and notions of legitimacy at
domestic and international levels]{.underline}**. **[States' adherence
to human rights norms represents an important signalling of their
commitment to democracy]{.underline}** 12 **[as well as their membership
in a club of nations that adhere to 'laws of universal
conscience']{.underline}**.13 Expectations that democracies fulfil their
moral commitments under international law have intensified as notions of
international order have increasingly linked democracy with human
rights.14 **[Compliance with human rights norms has become paramount to
shared understandings of global governance, justice and accountability,
such that states are increasingly willing to prioritise commitments to
international human rights law over short-term material interests, even
at significant economic costs]{.underline}**.15 **[When such norms have
acquired peremptory or jus cogens status, they are especially
foundational to preserving the rule of law on which international order
depends. Jus cogens status signals acceptance by the international
community of states as a whole, and states cannot derogate from or opt
out of jus cogens obligations, even by treaty]{.underline}**.16 Greater
attention to the connection between jus cogens norms and international
order is needed within IR, as these binding international standards are
arguably central to the ethos of the international community. **[Conklin
posits that violations of these norms call into question the very
existence of the international legal order, for 'when a state contra-
venes the peremptory norm, the legitimacy/authority of the international
community in which the preemptory norm is nested is
annulled']{.underline}**.17 Widely accepted examples of jus cogens norms
include prohibitions against attacks on civilians, genocide and
torture.18 Such prohibitions represent the extent to which core values
of the international community surrounding human rights have become 'so
fundamental to the system that the law could not survive without
them'.19 International human rights law provides a fundamental basis for
the protection of asylum- seekers, refugees and forcibly displaced
persons by shielding these individuals from viola- tions of accepted
international norms.20 This section of the article outlines two areas of
refugee protection that merit attention: the principle of
non-refoulement and the respon- sibility to protect refugees fleeing
mass atrocity crimes. Because these realms might be con- sidered
intrinsically connected to peremptory human rights norms of a jus cogens
nature and to customary international human rights law, state violations
of these obligations sim- ultaneously undermine the rule of law,
democratic legitimacy and international order. Non-refoulement In
exploring the emergence of the right to asylum as a customary norm in
international law, much attention has been paid to Article 33 in the
1951 Convention on the Status 4 A. COEN of Refugees (Refugee Convention)
and its provisions for non-refoulement -- provisions prohibiting states
from expelling or returning individuals to territories where they might
face persecution or torture. In addition to prohibiting states from
returning individ- uals to territories where their lives or freedom may
be threatened, the principle holds that refugees and asylum-seekers
cannot be prevented from pursuing protection once they have come under a
state's jurisdiction, regardless of whether their entry and presence in
the state is lawful.21 The prohibition on refoulement is widely
acknowledged as binding international customary law in the sense that
all states, regardless of whether they are party to refugee conventions,
are expected to adhere to the principle.22 **[As the cornerstone of
refugee protection, many scholars have argued that non-refoulment
additionally rises to the status of a peremptory or jus cogens norm from
which no derogation is permitted]{.underline}**.23 **[Its peremptory
status has been affirmed by the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees]{.underline}** (**[UNHCR]{.underline}**),24 and references to
non-refoule- ment as 'jus cogens' are also found in regional instruments
such as the Cartagena Declara- tion and the Brazil Declaration.25
**[Non-refoulment is fundamental to the jus cogens prohibition on
torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment in the event that
returning or deporting individuals to a territory might subject them to
such treatment]{.underline}**.26 **[Components of the European
Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), the International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention against Torture (CAT)
have all been cited as evidence that the obligations of non-refoulement
are binding and non-derogable]{.underline}**.27 In considering its jus
cogens status, Da Lomba notes that 'no state has ever overtly contested
the binding nature of the principle of non-refoulement during debates at
the UN General Assembly, including States that are not party to the 1951
Convention and/or the 1967 Protocol'.28 A strong case can therefore be
made for non-refoulement as a peremptory norm. It is important to note,
however, that national security and public safety exceptions provided
for in the Refugee Convention might enable states to derogate from the
principle under certain circumstances. The UNHCR specifies such
exceptions to be conditional on 'strict compliance with due process of
law' and emphasises that 'all reasonable steps must first be taken to
secure the admission of the individual concerned to a safe third
country'.29 While the parameters for lawful exceptions are quite
limited, Duffy argues that the practices of states regarding 'terrorist
exceptions' in the post-September 11 environment have hindered the
principle's peremptory status.30 Non-refoulement is thus characterised
by some, given its contested status, as an 'emerging' or 'evolving' jus
cogens norm.31 It is grounded firmly in treaties, international human
rights and refugee law, and in customary international law.32 A
responsibility to protect refugees fleeing mass atrocities The normative
framework of the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) is also relevant to jus
cogens obligations underpinning international order and the rule of law.
In addition to recommitting themselves to human rights and the rule of
law, UN member states at the 2005 World Summit accepted a collective
responsibility to protect populations from gen- ocide, war crimes,
ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, using 'appropriate dip-
lomatic, humanitarian and other peaceful means'.33 R2P was reaffirmed by
the UN Security Council in 2014 with the adoption of Resolution 2150,34
though its mainstreaming has been hindered by continued reservations
about potentially intrusive measures of implementation.35 While
contestation centres on its coercive elements and conflation with
humanitarian intervention, a nascent body of work has connected R2P
explicitly to a responsibility to protect refugees fleeing mass atrocity
crimes -- emphasising non-coercive measures such as the provision of
asylum, resettlement and upholding of non-refoulement as important
policy tools for protecting civilians from grave human rights abuses.36
There are clear links between R2P as a human rights framework and
peremptory norms in international law. Primarily, the four mass atrocity
crimes triggering its applicability are generally recognised as jus
cogens crimes.37 Moreover, Glanville observes the nexus between R2P and
jus cogens norms in Article 41(1) of the draft International Law
Commission (ILC) articles on the 'Responsibility of States for
Internationally Wrongful Acts', which calls on states to collectively
cooperate to address and counteract the effects of 'any serious
breaches' of the peremptory norms of international law.38 While the ILC
articles do not specify a precise form for state cooperation, refugee
responsibility-sharing in the face of mass displacement caused by
breaches of jus cogens norms arguably represents one important duty of
the inter- national community in this regard. **[Scholars of genocide
and mass killing note that barriers to immigration for victims fleeing
violence and inadequate refugee responsibility-sharing among states have
enabled substantially higher death tolls in mass atrocity
situations]{.underline}**.39 **[Fulfilling a responsibility to protect
refugees fleeing grave human rights abuses is therefore integral to
preventing further victimisation in the wake of jus cogens
crimes]{.underline}**. **[While neither R2P nor the international
refugee regime provides clear mechanisms for allocating
responsibilities, attention has been paid to the relative capacities of
states to offer asylum and other forms of protection for refugees,
measured by factors like economic development, unemployment level,
population density and territorial size]{.underline}**.40 Recent
European Union proposals for distributing asylum-seekers among member
states have simi- larly focused on capability-related factors like
national population and wealth levels.41 Studies have also proposed
focusing on culpability, integrating the impact of past policy decisions
by major powers more centrally into refugee responsibility-sharing
schemes. This work highlights special duties and obligations stemming
from military interventions, support for oppressive regimes and other
foreign policy actions contributing to mass dis- placement crises.42
Precise formulas for allocating responsibilities to protect refugees
remain contested, but it is reasonable to conclude that states with
strong capacities to offer asylum and other forms of protection for
victims fleeing mass atrocity crimes should fulfil their obligations to
do so as members of the international community, even if they were not
culpable in creating the conditions that facilitated grave human rights
abuses. **[For major powers possessing both a capacity to absorb
refugees and culpability-based responsibilities connected to jus cogens
crimes, the duty to offer refugee protections to certain groups of
displacees might be doubly strong]{.underline}**. Norm violations by the
United States **[As a global superpower, the United States is in a
unique position to bolster equitable and effective global governance and
affirm core human rights norms undergirding the inter- national rule of
law]{.underline}**. **[Ikenberry casts the foundations of a liberal
international order built around rules-based relations as dependent on
US hegemony and links the contemporary crisis in this world order to a
crisis of US leadership and authority]{.underline}**.43 **[For decades,
the convergence of its material capabilities and identity as a liberal
democracy prompted the United States to pursue democracy and human
rights promotion abroad as a means of establishing and imposing its
legitimacy and expertise]{.underline}**.44 **[When the United States
violates peremptory and customary human rights norms, it compromises its
legitimacy and also carves out important precedents for less powerful
states to follow suit with the understanding that a hegemonic actor has
implicitly endorsed such devi- ations in its own behaviours, undermining
the foundations of the international rule of law]{.underline}**. As
Sikkink observes, 'the real test of international law and \[human
rights\] norms is their ability to influence the actions of even the
most powerful states'.45 A consideration of US behaviour is therefore
paramount for grappling with human rights norms compliance and its
implications for international order.

This Article looks to an untapped resource to gain new traction on the
functional dimension of these perennial debates. **[The common
denominator of nettlesome war powers questions is who should
make]{.underline}** the **[difficult]{.underline}** and **[freighted
decisions about whether]{.underline}** **[the nation goes to war, how it
fights]{.underline}** a war, **[and when it ends]{.underline}** a
**[war.]{.underline}** Surprisingly, however, **[scholars have not
considered how psychological research on decisionmaking
impacts]{.underline}** the **[constitutional design of war powers. In
the last four decades, [psychologists]{.mark}]{.underline}** have
**[[demonstrated systematic biases in individual and group
decisionmaking processes.]{.underline}]{.mark}** This **[behavioral
revolution has been no stranger to legal scholarship]{.underline}**,
particularly in the field of law and economics, where it has been
**[used as a corrective to]{.underline}** some of the **[oversights
of]{.underline}** the more **[rationalist approaches that preceded
it.]{.underline}**12 The **[behavioral revolution]{.underline}** has
also **[provided important insights to scholars of
i]{.underline}**nternational **[r]{.underline}**elations, **[where
political scientists increasingly write in the subfield of political
psychology and international relations.]{.underline}** 13 In fact,
psychologist Daniel Kahneman and political scientist Jonathan Renshon
have recently collaborated on an important article that argues that
**[behavioral psychology has valuable lessons for decisionmaking on war
and peace.]{.underline}** 14 Over time, psychologists and political
scientists have identified **[a number of decisionmaking
[biases]{.mark}]{.underline}** that **[are particularly [relevant to
decisions about war]{.mark} and peace.]{.underline}** For example,
**[[positive illusion bias]{.mark} [suggests]{.mark}]{.underline}** that
**[[individuals unrealistically value their own abilities, leading to
undue optimism and an illusion of control]{.mark} over how the future
will play out.]{.underline}** 15 In the foreign policy context,
**[this]{.underline}** illusion of control **[can lead [countries to be
overconfident]{.mark} about their ability to win a war
and]{.underline}** therefore **[more likely to initiate one. Prospect
theory suggests]{.underline}** that **[individuals are more concerned
with avoiding or recovering losses than]{.underline}** with **[making or
extending gains.]{.underline}** 16 This **[[loss aversion leads
to]{.mark} the related problem of [sunk costs,]{.mark} under which
[individuals]{.mark} will [irrationally continue striving for an outcome
instead of cutting their losses]{.mark} and moving on.]{.underline}**17
Psychic numbing holds that human beings are more morally attentive when
actions appear to affect discrete individuals, rather than when
confronted with abstract statistics.1 8 Humanitarian interventions might
therefore be less likely when leaders are given statistical information
about the loss of life rather than seeing arresting images or meeting
with suffering individuals. But **[despite their relevance to matters of
war and peace, these lessons have yet to be incorporated into debates on
war powers.]{.underline}** This Article introduces important lessons
from behavioral psychology into constitutional debates on the doctrine,
structure, and design of war powers. In doing so, we have three goals:
First, we identify and explain **[a series of [behavioral
pathologies]{.mark}]{.underline}** that **[might [skew]{.mark}
[important]{.mark} [decisions]{.mark} about war and peace]{.underline}**
so that legal scholars can be more attentive to them. **[Legal arguments
in this area are frequently based on allocating war
powers]{.underline}** so as **[to promote better
decisionmaking]{.underline}** (e.g., favoring the President because of
greater access to information and expertise vis-A-vis Congress), 19 and
proposals for law reform have that goal by necessity. **[If decisions
about war can go off track in systematic ways, it makes sense
to]{.underline}** at least **[consider these systematic problems as
relevant factors]{.underline}** in **[designing]{.underline}** an
**[optimal]{.underline}** (or at least improved) **[allocation of
powers.]{.underline}**

### 2ac -- Process Focus Bad

#### Techy, legalistic focus is bad -- this CP is an invention of debate, completely contrived for an arbitrary net benefit -- no author would ever consider these two options against eachother. The impact is the infinite deferral of ethicality because there will always be a new, slightly different fix

#### Our representational ethic matters -- Reducing debate to the question of policymaking centered on technical, managerial comparisons suppresses contestation over the social relations out of which those policies emerge.

Žižek (1999b, 2006a) and Mouffe (2005) define post-politics as a
political formation that forecloses the political.
**[Post-politicization reduces political terrain to the sphere of
consensual governing and [policy-making centered on technical,
managerial]{.mark} and consensual [administration]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(**[policing]{.underline}**) **[of environmental, social, economic or
other domains]{.underline}**. **[These efforts remain [within the realm
of existing social relations]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} '**[The
ultimate sign of post-politics]{.underline}** in all Western countries',
Žižek (2002: 303) argues, '**[is the growth of a managerial approach to
government: government [is]{.mark} reconceived as a managerial function,
[deprived of its]{.mark} proper [political dimension'.]{.mark} Today's
consensual times]{.underline}** thus **[eliminate a genuine political
space of disagreement]{.underline}**. Under a post-political condition,
'\[e\]verything is politicized, can be discussed, but only in a
non-committal way and as a non-conflict. **[[Absolute and irreversible
choices are kept away; politics]{.mark} becomes something one can do
[without making decisions]{.mark} that divide and
separate']{.underline}** (Diken and Laustsen, 2004: 15). **[Difficulties
and problems, such as re-ordering the climate or re-shaping the
environment]{.underline}**, which are generally staged and accepted as
problematic, **[need to be dealt with through]{.underline}** compromise,
**[managerial and technical arrangement]{.underline}**, and the
production of consensus. Key here is 'the annulment of dissensus ... the
"end of politics"' (Rancière, 2001: §32; see also Swyngedouw, 2009).
**[Climate governance and the policing of environmental concerns are
pivotal]{.underline}** arenas through which post-political consensus is
constructed, **[when '[politics]{.mark} proper [is]{.mark} progressively
[replaced by]{.mark} expert social
[administration']{.mark}]{.underline}** (Žižek, 2005: 117). **[The
postpoliticizing environmental consensus is thus radically reactionary,
[forestalling the articulation of]{.mark} conflicting or [alternative
trajectories of future]{.mark} environmental
[dynamics]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[There is [no contestation
over]{.mark} the [givens]{.mark} of the situation, over the partition of
the sensible]{.underline}**; **[there is [only debate over technologies
of management]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[timing of their
implementation]{.underline}**, **[arrangements of policing and the
interests of those whose voices are recognized as
legitimate]{.underline}**. In this post-political era, adversarial
politics (of the left/right variety or of radically divergent struggles
over imagining different socio-environmental futures, for example) are
considered hopelessly out of date. **[Disagreement and debate are still
possible, but operate within a model]{.underline}** of elite consensus
and agreement (Crouch, 2004), **[subordinated to a
managerial--technocratic regime]{.underline}** (Jörke, 2005; Blühdorn,
2006). **[Disagreement is allowed, but only about the choice of
(eco-)technologies]{.underline}**, **[the mix of organizational
fixes]{.underline}**, **[the detail of the (eco-)managerial
adjustments]{.underline}**, **[and the urgency of their timing and
implementation, not with respect to the socio-political framing of
present and future natures.]{.underline}** Thus **[environmental and
other politics are reduced to the sphere of the police, to the domain of
managing, governing]{.underline}** and polic(y)ing through
'participatory' procedures within a given hierarchical structure.
Consensual policy-making in which **[the
[stakeholders]{.mark}]{.underline}** (i.e. **[those with recognized
speech]{.underline}**) **[[are known in advance]{.mark} and where
[disruption or dissent is reduced to debates over]{.mark} the
[institutional]{.mark} modalities of [governing]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[the accountancy calculus of risk]{.underline}**, and **[the
technologies of expert administration or management]{.underline}**,
**[announces the end of politics]{.underline}**, **[annuls dissent from
the consultative spaces of policy-making]{.underline}**, **[and
evacuates the properly political from the public sphere]{.underline}**.

#### Focus on finding the correct bureaucratic decision obliterates wider social transformation \-- working towards a new radical imagination is the only way to create the best policies.

(Gargi, How can we live with ourselves? Universities and the attempt to
reconcile learning and doing, Ethnic and Racial Studies, Vol. 36, No. 9,
1411-1428)

In Britain also **[there has been a move away from radical imagination
in the politics of race, towards]{.underline}** either **[highly
institutionalized activity designed to measure and correct differential
outcomes]{.underline}**, or to ethnic particularity that challenges
racism faced by a particular group but rarely links this activity to
other struggles or a vision of an alternative society. **[However
necessary these forms of organization may be]{.underline}** because
institutional outcomes continue to harden inequality between groups and
mobilization needs to take place where people are, building on the
affiliations that make sense to them **[the [loss of a larger
vision]{.mark} and set of aspirations [diminishes]{.mark} what
[anti-racist]{.mark} politics can be]{.underline}**. Kelly (2002, p.
xii) goes on to specify **[the loss that arises [from too
exclusive]{.mark} a [focus]{.mark} on matters of [institutional detail
or immediate politicking: Without new visions we don't know what to
build,]{.mark} only what to knock down.]{.underline}** **[[We not only
end up confused, rudderless, and cynical]{.mark}, but [we forget
that]{.mark} making a [revolution is not a series of]{.mark} clever
[maneuvers and tactics but]{.mark} a process that can and [must
transform us.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[This new revolutionary subject
is unlikely to emerge from]{.mark} the [mundane techniques of
management]{.mark} that have come to typify 'useful' research in the
field of racism]{.underline}**. In response to the formulation of recent
research funding in the UK, research in the field of race and racism
that connects with 'users' has tended towards the technical. Much of
this is shaped by the demand that research demonstrate its own 'impact',
that is, shows its usefulness to an audience beyond academia, often
before any findings are made and in order for time and money to be
allocated.6 **[For the field of race and ethnic studies, this demand
brings a model of knowledge as]{.underline}** technique often
**[management technique]{.underline}**. Whether racism is seen to arise
from communicational barriers between groups or from flawed
institutional practices, the solution is presented as alternative
practices do this and others will adapt their behaviour in these ways.
If this were the extent of the imaginative failure, things would not be
too bad. After all, universities rarely include the most exciting of
ideas until the excitement can be rewritten as tradition. Sometimes
banishment from the academy can help to get a different and more
energetic audience for ideas that aspire to change our world. However,
the politics of race seems to be institutionalized in an even more
tightly confined logic in the spaces outside the academy. There may be a
widespread recognition that racism demands an institutional response,
but this is ripped away from any larger political narrative altogether.
**[As a result, the [attempts by scholars]{.mark} to address a public
also [tend to be limited by]{.mark} the [narrow demands of]{.mark} such
[technical or legalistic approaches]{.mark} to what anti-racism can and
should be]{.underline}**. There is a dilemma here. **[For scholars who
wish to connect with]{.underline}** so called
**[practitioners]{.underline}** and who, perhaps, consider this world of
equalities practice as **[their]{.underline}** 'public' **[research is
likely to become focused around these questions of technical
organization]{.underline}**. Of course, many of us still seek to
document and explore the complexity of racism and its impact in the
world but **[the focus for this endeavour becomes segmented by
institutional focus and, often, a rush to make
'recommendations']{.underline}**. Access to research funding in Britain,
increasingly the only route to creating space for scholarly work,
demands that research delivers this 'impact' of immediate and usable
advice. At the same time, the 'public' of practitioners a group here
that is overwhelmingly concentrated in organizations tasked with
delivering services to diverse populations, whether through statutory
services or the third sector appear to understand the role of the
intellectual only as this kind of technical adviser.7 **[Useful
[research becomes only]{.mark} this [research that can enable]{.mark}
alternative and potentially [more effective operation of bureaucratic
practices]{.mark} of one kind or another. This framing of anti-racist
research transforms the kind of politics that can be imagined for this
intellectual endeavour. [This is anti-racism as]{.mark} a matter of
[organizational adaptation, not]{.mark} any wider [social
transformation]{.mark}. Perhaps [some believe]{.mark} that
[transformation occurs through the collective impact of]{.mark} these
[many small organizational changes]{.mark}]{.underline}** that has
certainly been the unspoken implication of anti- racist work since the
Lawrence Enquiry **[but, whatever the benefits of improved institutional
practices]{.underline}**, if these in fact have been achieved, **[[this
approach abandons any sense of political
movement]{.underline}]{.mark}**. We may be producing work that connects
with a public, but the aspirations of both scholars and public seem less
than they were.

Brexit]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and **[moves]{.underline}** on **[to the
rise of authoritarianism]{.underline}**s. **[Liberal democracies get
resuscitated]{.underline}**, ironically, **[[through financial
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[postcrisis
accumulations]{.underline}** by the elite, urban reforms, **[as well as
multi-scalar ecological discourses. This is realized through perfor
mative displays, discussions, and resolutions through
fixes]{.underline}**. **[The [post-political fixes seek to tweak]{.mark}
the economy, urban [processes]{.mark}, or ecology.]{.underline}**
**[These are [designed to create a general impression that everything is
in order]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Everything may, in fact, be in order.
It is just that the order is **[[sustained by a silence of
politics]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The author problematizes this silence.
Significantly, across urban spaces, insurgent movements by people 'who
put their bodies on the line' also emerge in such situations. Urban
insurgencies like the ones in Zuccotti Park, Paternoster Square, Taksim
Square, Tahrir Square or elsewhere, did threaten to break the silence of
politics in the context of reconfigurations of 'democratic
institutions'. Swyngedouw's earlier works dwell on **[the impotencies of
the political with]{.underline}** close **[reference to governance,
development in general, nature, hydrological cycles, and
anthropocene]{.underline}**. Promises of the Political consolidates
these concerns, reinforced by more comprehensive theorization.
Swyngedouw asks what happens when **[[politics becomes reduced to sets
of techno-managerial]{.mark} dispositifs or
[fixes]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The techno-managerial dispositifs
**[themselves]{.underline}** are **[[predicated on a]{.mark} profound
[lack of politics in public discussion and deliberative
processes]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[It is doubtful whether emancipatory
politics of any kind ispossible in such a context.]{.underline}** So do
we end up by just fixing the system and perpetuating the entrenched
orders? The concern for how **[[the political is eviscerated from public
spaces]{.underline}]{.mark}** underlies this work. **[Bereft of the
political, the belief in post-democratic structures becomes
entrenched]{.underline}**. Swyngedouw's ethnographic sources for
substantiating the post-political argument are the city and nature --
urban and environmental processes. He engages with issues such as the
erosion of democracy, weakening of the public sphere, removal of
agonistic disagreements, colonization of the political or the silences
of consensus processes. Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, Bob Jessops, Jean-Luc
Nancy, Chantal Mouffe, Jacques Rancière, Slavoj Žižek, Alain Badiou, and
Colin Crouch emphasize similar postfoundationalist concerns. Promises of
the Political, is more ethnographically grounded and turns its lens
towards pertinent questions such as how ecology, in the present context,
pace Badiou, becomes 'the new opium of the masses'. **[Neoliberal
planetary urbanization and carbon-centric fetishisation]{.underline}**
of ecology **[exemplify typical post-democratic
processes]{.underline}**. The techno-managerial dispositifs also make
the political appear more spectral. This is so because
**[[post-democratic]{.mark} good [governance enables controls to]{.mark}
emerge outside the state and magically work inwards]{.underline}**,
through perceived or projected failures of the state. **[The controls
[take the form]{.mark}s [of institutional practices]{.mark} nurtured by
the state, international bodies]{.underline}** like the EU, **[corporate
apparatuses]{.underline}** like the World Bank **[or non-state
actors]{.underline}**. But **[[there is an accompanying rhetoric of
participation]{.mark}, inclusion, or empowerment, unlike the rhetoric of
entrenched state hierarchies. Good governance is usually [attributed to
horizontal]{.mark}ly laid out [hybrids of private and state
bodies]{.mark}. [Power structures are dispersed]{.mark} from
local]{.underline}** (stakeholder bodies/ committees) **[to
transnational]{.underline}** (Conference of Parties on Climate Change).
The different urban regimes are significant in the redeployment of the
state into public and private realms and ensuring the cohesion of the
civil society wherever there are stresses and strains in the system.
This has been the case historically (1920s, 1990s or the 2008 crises).
'The opaque networks, fuzzy institutional arrangements and ill-defined
responsibilities' make the democratic lacunae more profound. On the
other hand, regimes shift welfarist obligations from the realms of the
state into rational and individuated citizens who are 'empowered' and
free from the state. While discussing the changing themes of pluralist
democracy, the question of legitimacy comes up.
**[Legitimacy]{.underline}**, unlike in a representative order, **[now
relies entirely on discursive construction of images of the
desirable]{.underline}**. The author brings up **[the
'[post-truth']{.mark} [environment]{.mark} in the context where there is
a parallel silencing of alternatives]{.underline}**. **[Bereft of clear
channels of accountability and [mediated by new]{.mark}
[institutions]{.mark} (local bodies, urban institutions) into an order
over which there is no control, [people find lesser channels for public
engagement]{.mark} on what is desirable and what is not.]{.underline}**
The state still remains the main deployer of this horizontally networked
order. But markers of pluralist democracies turn diffuse. The
**[ambiguities]{.underline}** that ensue **[become the means whereby
post-democracies deal with the crisis of legitimation]{.underline}**.
**[The state,]{.underline}** through procedural un-clarities, **[becomes
the corollary of capitalism]{.underline}**. The crisis of the welfare
state or that of Keynesianism institutes and legitimates the 'withdrawal
of state rhetoric'. Any possible assumption of the loss in regulatory
capacities is also misplaced. It is just that **[the regulatory role
appears to have shifted on to the individual who appears to be a
volunteer who also has to take up responsibility for fallouts of the
post-political order]{.underline}**. **[The book clearly differentiates
the ritually codified policy making of post-democracies]{.underline}**.
Mouffe, Crouch and Rancière associate post-politics (consensus politics)
with the rise of post-democratic institutional configurations. For
Rancière, the political is the place where the police meet politics.
Police refers both to activities of the state as well as ordering. But
post-Althusser, policing is not just about interpellation, but about
assigning the proper time and space for people. For Žižek and Badiou
there needs to be an inaugural event which then becomes an interruption
in the existing order. The political for them is about ruptures where
the Oochlos (in Greek for rabble, mob, and multitude) becomes the demos.
The re-appropriation of space as well as production of novel spaces that
follow, away from state, parallels what Cornelius Castoriadis calls a
radical 1 imaginary. Swyngedouw portrays how **[[the
post-political]{.mark} frame [reduces politics to]{.mark} [policy making
and techno-managerial solutions, mediated by institutions]{.mark} within
the state, like parliaments, city chambers, or public private
partnerships]{.underline}**. **[The procedures involved are often
exemplary]{.underline}**. The good-governance, already mentioned, is
about changes in governmentality. Apropos Foucault, **[this is the
convergence of technologies that become pre-eminent against sovereign
disciplining]{.underline}**. **[Ironically, it is against the latter
that the former often positions itself and gains
legitimacy.]{.underline}** The quasi **[institutional networks within
public-private hybrids deploy]{.underline}** the bios of humans (e.g.
biometrics -- that have become **[compulsion and
contention]{.underline}** in the contemporary Indian context) **[into
managerial fixes]{.underline}**. The scales of such networks range from
urban developmental bodies to the European Union or the Conference of
Parties (CoP) on Climate Change. The horizontal arrangements of good
governance that transcend the state gain credibility through perceived
state-failures. In traditional liberal democracies, the state is
articulated by political citizenry, and **[[state power is exercised
through]{.underline}]{.mark}** policing, biopolitical controls or by the
bureaucracy. In governance regimes, independent actors enter into
normative agreements. Philippe Schmitter's idea of **[[the
transformation of 'political citizenry' into the]{.mark} post political
'[stakeholder']{.mark}]{.underline}** has been appropriately brought in.
Several holders (of rights, space, or knowledge, with stakes of status,
or interests) become component parts and independent actors.
**[[Agonistic differences are overridden by]{.mark} certain [benchmarks
and calculations of risks]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[State]{.underline}**, for Swyngedouw, **[institutes the
hierarchically organized scales as a gestalt wherein power becomes
choreographed]{.underline}**. **[Responsibilization, pluralist
[fragmentation, individuation]{.mark}s, [and calculations (of risk)
become the programmes by which elitist rules translate into]{.mark}
everyday [practices]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[From the elaborations of
the specifics of participatory deliberative practices, one understands
how the procedures [only]{.mark} happen [within the 'possible' and
normative]{.mark}ly agreed]{.underline}**.

### 2ac -- Representations come first

#### Political reality only comes into being after we describe the world. Thus we have to deal with how the Affirmative represents the world before we can move on to any other question 

#### **Blieker '00 \-- Professor of International Relations at the University of Queensland, where he directs an interdisciplinary research program on Visual Politics (Ronald, Contending Images if World Politics, Contending Images of World Politics By Greg Fry, Jacinta O\'Hagan, p. 227-8//JC)**

While the conceptual contours of the postmodern will always remain
elusive, the substantial issues that this image of world politics has
brought to the forefront have clear and important implications. Critical
engagements with modernity have emerged from a dissatisfaction with what
Lyotard famously described as a long modern tendency to ground and
legitimize knowledge in reference to a grand narrative, that is, [a
universalizing framework which seeks to emancipate the individual by
**mastering the conditions** of life]{.mark} (Lyotard, 1979, pp. 7-9[).
Even when such a]{.mark} master [narrative seems unquestionably
desirable, it inevitably **legitimizes and objectivizes** certain
interpretations and political agendas, thereby excluding everything that
does not fit into its corresponding view of life]{.mark}. Authors who
are said to represent a postmodern image of the world politics grapple
with the implications that emerge from the prevalence of master
narratives in world politics. They challenge the way in which scientific
discourses that have emerged from the Cartesian separation of the object
and subject mask the constituted dimensions of life. They engage
prevalent thinking patterns so that we can see the world from more that
one perspective, and that marginalized voices can be brought into the
realm of dialogue. [This search for epistemological tolerance and
inclusion is as much political as it is philosophical]{.mark}. Ant its
practical applicability is -- needless to say -- virtually unlimited. It
is in this sense that, for instance, all feminisms can be thought of as
a postmodern' (Sylvester, 1994, p. 16). The purpose of this essay is not
to summarize the great variety of postmodern approaches to the world
politics. Several authors have already done so (see for instance, Brown,
1994; Devetak, 1996). The main effort of this essay thus revolves around
demonstrating how something termed postmodernism may work. From such a
perspective the 'how' is as important as the 'is'. In fact, the 'how'
becomes the 'is' insofar as the nature of something is identified
primarily as the process through which it works. The prime task of such
an approach consists not of looking at modernity or postmodernity as
metaphors of contemporary world politics, but of understanding -- and
acting upon -- the more fundamental recognition that all forms of
thought are metaphorical in nature. They cannot be anything else, for
[language itself is a series of metaphors through which we make sense of
the world that surrounds us]{.mark}. And since we need language not only
to communicate, but also to form our opinions of social phenomena, we
inevitably think, live and politicize through a series of metaphors --
that is, through forms of conceptualizing that contain inevitable gaps
between a representation of an event and the event itself. Various
implications follow from an approach that acknowledges the metaphorical
nature of our understanding of world politics. At the beginning is
perhaps the simple recognition that representation is an essential
aspect of the political process. [Political reality]{.mark}, F.R.
Ankersmit stresses, '[is' not first given to us and subsequently
represented; **political reality only comes into being after and due to
representations'**]{.mark} (1996, pg. 47). [What this means]{.mark} for
an analysis of world politics [is that before being able to move it to
any other in question, one has to deal with how the representation has
structured the object it seeks to represent.]{.mark} Pg. 227 -- 228

## 2AC -- Torture Adv

### 2AC -- US Support Bad

#### US companies manufacture stun belts -- allows countries to torture

**Amnesty International \'19** (Amnesty International, 6-26-2019, \"5
tools of torture which need to be banned\",
https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/06/5-tools-of-torture-which-need-to-be-banned/)
\[HS\]

Today is International Day in Support of Victims of Torture. Sadly,
[torture remains rife in many countries]{.underline}. And more than
sixty years after torture was outlawed internationally, [gruesome
torture equipment is still being openly marketed and traded around the
world]{.underline}. At glitzy [arms and security fairs, governments can
browse stalls selling equipment whose sole purpose is to cause pain and
fear]{.underline}. An export ban in the EU has made this trade more
difficult in recent years, but there is still no international agreement
to ban tools of torture. This week, governments at the UN General
Assembly will vote on passing a resolution aimed at ending the torture
trade for good. We are urging states to adopt this resolution, which is
long overdue, and tighten up the loose regulations which have let the
torture trade thrive. Here are [five tools of torture which need to be
banned immediately - and what we know about who's using
them]{.underline}. Stun belts What are they? [Stun belts deliver high
voltage shocks, via electrodes placed near the prisoner's kidneys,
causing severe pain]{.underline}. They are worn, sometimes for many
hours at a time, with the constant threat that they will be activated by
remote control. Other [physical effects can include muscular weakness,
involuntary urination and defecation, heartbeat irregularities, seizures
and welts on the skin]{.underline}. Who's selling? [Stun belts and other
body worn electric shock devices]{.underline} (cuffs, vests) [have been
manufactured]{.underline} by companies all over the world. [There are
known
manufacturers](https://omegaresearchfoundation.org/sites/default/files/uploads/Publications/Body%20Worn%20E%20Shock%20Poster%20Ettlingen_FINAL.pdf)
of this kind of equipment [in the US]{.underline}, South Africa, and
China, and known suppliers in countries including India and Israel.
Who's buying? These [devices have been used to control prisoners in
certain countries]{.underline} including South Africa and [some US
states](https://omegaresearchfoundation.org/case-studies/use-body-worn-electric-shock-us-state-prisons).
One inmate in the US whose stun belt was activated
[described](https://omegaresearchfoundation.org/case-studies/use-body-worn-electric-shock-us-state-prisons)
[the pain as 'so intense that I thought that I was actually
dying']{.underline}.

#### The US is responsible in the torture trade

\[HS\]

Restraint chairs What are they? Who's selling? Chinese companies have
marketed these chairs to law enforcement agencies within China. [The US
also manufactures these chairs and their use has been
documented]{.underline} in the context of abuses in the [Guantanamo
Bay](https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/EUR0116322015ENGLISH.PDF)
Detention Centre. Who's buying? Amnesty has documented the use by
Chinese prison and law enforcement officials of a range of degrading and
painful restraint techniques involving these chairs. Tang Jitian[, a
former prosecutor]{.underline} and lawyer [in Beijing, told Amnesty he
was tortured by local security officials]{.underline} in March 2014. "[I
was strapped to an iron chair, slapped in the face, kicked on my legs
and hit so hard over the head with a plastic bottle filled with water
that I passed out]{.underline}," he said. In 2016 chilling footage
emerged of a teenager being hooded and [strapped to a restraint
chair](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/07/australia-guantanamo-style-abuse-of-child-prisoners-shows-current-detention-system-has-failed/)
in Australia's Northern Territory. After an international outcry,
Australia suspended the use of restraint chairs in juvenile detention
centres -- but they are still permitted in adult prisons. [It's time to
ban the trade in this appalling equipment - no company should profit
from pain and suffering]{.underline}. Amnesty is calling for UNGA member
**[states to]{.underline}** adopt the resolution, and [work towards
regulation aimed at ending the torture trade for good]{.underline}.

#### EU already banned export, US is main exporter of torture devices to EU

**US official News 14**

(Infotrac Newsstand, place of publication, "EU must close all loopholes
in the torture trade,") // WhtCbn

**[Amnesty International USA has issued the following]{.underline}**
news **[release]{.underline}**: The European Union (EU) must urgently
**[strengthen its laws to]{.underline}** enable member states to
**[immediately ban the trade in new devices and technologies that have
no practical use other than to torture, ill-treat or execute
individuals,]{.underline}** said Amnesty International and the Omega
Research Foundation, as experts meet in Brussels today to strengthen
current regulations. **[The organizations are also
calling]{.underline}** on the EU **[to close current legal loopholes
which effectively allow the promotion, brokering and provision of
technical training in the use of devices and technologies that can
easily be used]{.underline}** by law enforcers for acts of torture or
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. \"The
recently reviewed European regulations against the trade in torture
tools are ground-breaking and unique in the world but loopholes
remain,\" said Brian Wood, Arms Control, Security Trade and Human Rights
Project Manager at Amnesty International. \"The range of already banned
items comprises a veritable chamber of horrors: thumb-cuffs, restraint
chairs, metal batons and even injection systems designed to administer
lethal injections to name just a few. However, **[merely expanding the
control lists every few years will not by itself]{.underline}** enable
the EU to immediately **[outlaw new torture technologies and
devices]{.underline}**.\" \"This is an important first step in a long
delayed overhaul of EU trade controls. The EU **[experts]{.underline}**
meeting today **[now have an opportunity to better protect people
throughout the world from torture]{.underline}** and death penalty
technologies **[by closing specific known loopholes in]{.underline}** EU
**[law and ensure]{.underline}** European **[companies are not complicit
in the despicable abuses]{.underline}** that these tools are used for,\"
said Dr Michael Crowley, Research Associate at the Omega Research
Foundation. A new legally binding EU regulation adopted on 16 July
expands the list of torture tools that must be banned and expands the
list of security equipment that must be strictly controlled. This
enhances the first EU regulation introduced in June 2005 but EU
officials are still discussing further changes to EU trade control
mechanisms to prevent businesses in the EU from trading in equipment
used for torture or the death penalty. Amongst **[the expanded range of
goods that now cannot be exported by EU businesses or individuals
are]{.underline}**: \* **[Devices used for executions]{.underline}**,
including: gallows and guillotines, electric chairs, airtight vaults for
the administration of lethal gas, automatic drug-injection systems for
the administration of lethal injections and drugs when intended for such
executions; \* **[Equipment designed for restraint]{.underline}**,
including: thumb-cuffs, finger-cuffs, thumbscrews and finger-screws, bar
fetters, weighted leg restraints, restraint chairs, shackle boards and
beds and cage beds; \* Spiked metal batons or shields, whips made of
multiple lashes. **[The list of goods whose export is strictly
controlled includes an expanded range of security equipment that can be
legitimately used for law enforcement but which can easily be misused
for torture and ill-treatment]{.underline}** such as: \* Electroshock
stun devices to target a single individual and now also devices that can
inflict electric shocks on groups of people; \* Equipment designed for
discharging chemical incapacitants or irritants for riot control that
target individuals as well as those that disseminate such chemicals over
wide areas; \* Shackles and gang chains. **[Experts are now further
reviewing the trade mechanisms in the regulation,]{.underline}** and
will issue a proposal to the European Parliament and the European
Council for consideration in the next three months. **[Specific
loopholes]{.underline}** **[identified]{.underline}** by Amnesty
International and the Omega Foundation potentially allow companies
registered in the EU **[to]{.underline}**: **[\* Broker torture tools to
third countries outside the EU as long as the devices don\'t touch EU
soil; \*]{.underline}** Promote torture tools at EU arms fairs and
exhibitions; **[\* Provide technical assistance including training in
techniques that can facilitate torture and other ill-treatment; \*
Introduce new technologies and devices onto the market and offer them to
law enforcers even if there is a strong likelihood those items will be
used in the death penalty, torture or other
ill-treatment.]{.underline}**

Given the foregoing documentation it hardly needs to be added that in
the modern era the USA is by far the greatest practitioner of terrorism
in the world. Again space permits no more than a brief selection from
the many summary statements to this effect. '**[The US has rained death
and destruction on more people in more regions of the globe than any
other nation in the period since the Second World War]{.underline}** ...
it has employed its military forces in other countries over 70 times
since 1945, not counting innumerable instances of counter insurgency
operations by the CIA.' 45 '... the US state has long been using
terrorist networks, and carrying out acts of terror itself.' 46 The US
'... is the greatest source of terror on earth'.47 'The greatest source
of terrorism48 is the US itself and some of the Latin American
countries.' 49 '... the US is itself a leading terrorist state.' 50
'There are many terrorist states, but the United States is unusual in
that it is officially committed to internationa l terrorism, and on a
scale that puts its rivals to shame.' 51 'We are the target of
terrorists because in much of the world our government stands for
dictatorship, bondage, and human exploitation. ... We are the target of
terrorists because we are hated. ... And we are hated because our
governments have done hateful things. ... Time after time we have ousted
popular leaders who wanted the riches of the land to be shared by the
people who worked it. ... We are hated because our government denies
(democracy, freedom, human rights) to people in Third World countries
whose resources are coveted by our multinational corporations.' 52 'In
1998 Amnesty International released a report that made it clear that the
**[US was 'at least as responsible for extreme violation of human rights
around the globe as---including the promotion of torture]{.underline}**
and terrorism and state violence---as any government or organisation in
the world.' 53 'From any objective standpoint, Israel and the

clearly understood for decades by critical students of American Foreign
Policy is evident in the following quotes from the late 1970s and early
1980s. '... the US and its allies have armed the elites of the Third
World to the teeth, and saturated them with counterinsurgency weaponry
and training. ... **[Hideous torture has become standard practice in US
client fascist states.]{.underline}** ... **[Much of the electronic and
other torture gear, is US supplied and great numbers of ...
interrogators are US trained]{.underline}** ...'.55 "**[Many of the
world's most brutal dictatorships "... are in place precisely because
they serve US interests in a joint venture with local torturers at the
expense of their majorities]{.underline}**".'56 **[After documenting

abuses']{.underline}**, Trosan and Yates say, '**[Without US help they

Whenever their people have rebelled and tried to seize power, thereby
threatening foreign investments, **[the USA has on every occasion
actively supported government repression and terror, or has promoted

### 2AC -- Companies Export Devices

\[HS\]

In its March 1997 report entitled "Recent Cases of the Use of
Electroshock Weapons for Torture or Ill Treatment," Amnesty
International lists [100 companies worldwide that]{.underline} produce
and sell instruments of torture. Forty-two of these firms [are in the
United States]{.underline}. This places [the U.S. as the leader in the
manufacture of stun guns, stun belts, cattle probe-like devices, and
other equipment which can cause devastating pain in the hands of
torturers.]{.underline} According to the report, the following are some
of the [American companies currently engaged in the production and sale
of such weapons]{.underline}: [Arianne International of Palm Beach
Gardens, Florida; B-west Imports Inc. of Tucson, Arizona; and Taserton
of Corona, California. Arianne]{.underline} International
[makes]{.underline} the "Myotron," [a compact version of the stun
gun]{.underline}. [B-West]{.underline} joined with Paralyzer Protection,
a South African company, to [produce shock batons]{.underline} that
deliver a charge of between 80,000 and 120,000 volts. [Taserton was the
first]{.underline} [company to manufacture the taser,]{.underline} a
product which shoots two wires attached to darts with metal hooks. When
these hooks catch a victim's skin or clothing, the device delivers a
debilitating shock. Los Angeles police officers used the device against
Rodney King in 1991. These [weapons are currently in use in the U.S. and
are being exported to countries all over the world]{.underline}. The
U.S. government is a large purchaser of stun devices specially stun
guns, electroshock batons, and electric shields. The American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU) and Amnesty both claim the devices are unsafe and
may encourage sadistic acts by police officers and prison guards both
here and abroad. "[Stun belts]{.underline} offer enormous possibilities
for [abuse and the infliction of gratuitous pain]{.underline}," says
Jenni Gainsbourough of the ACLU's National Prison Project. She adds that
because use of the [stun belt leaves little]{.underline} physical
[evidence]{.underline}, [this increases the likelihood of
sadistic]{.underline}, but hard-to-prove, misuse of these weapons. In
June 1996, Amnesty International asked the Bureau of Prisons to suspend
the use of electroshock belt, citing the possibility of physical danger
to inmates and the [potential for misuse]{.underline}. In 1991, Terence
Allen, a specialist in forensic pathology who served as deputy medical
examiner for both Los Angeles and San Francisco's coroner's offices,
linked the taser to fatalities. [With electrical current]{.underline},
Allen says, [the chance of death increases with each use]{.underline}.
Allen warns, "I think what you are going to see is more deaths from stun
weapons." [Manufacturers of electroshock weapons continue to denounce
allegations that use of their devices is dangerous and may constitute a
gross violation of human rights.]{.underline} Instead, [they are making
more advanced innovations]{.underline}. A new stun weapon may soon be
added to police arsenals: the electroshock razor wire, specially
designed for surrounding demonstrators who get out of hand.

It may be clear that a dyadic view of the "basic structure" of torture
does not make a chain of command basic to that structure, although
[torture certainly is embedded in a chain of command]{.underline}. In
fact, [the dyad closes off from scrutiny all political, social, and
economic networks that support the activity]{.underline}. These
certainly include social and institutional arrangements designed to
train and condition violence workers, such as those described in a
recent study of Brazilian torturers or Tony Lagouranis's 2007
first-person account of torture in Mosul, Iraq. 36 [Erasure of
supporting networks also includes the supply chain that manufactures and
equips state personnel with, say, tasers in the first place]{.underline}
--- like those used by four Special Ops officers disciplined for burning
captives at Camp Nama and like those exported to our rendition allies
annually. 37 In 2003, in the midst of all the speculative debate on the
utility of torture in the war on terror, [a single story in U.S. News
and World Report noted that more than sixty American companies had
obtained annual approvals to export stun batons, stun guns, thumb cuffs,
and other devices to thirty-nine countries known to torture
dissidents]{.underline}. 38 [There are other devices, special and
mundane, that come from somewhere at a profit: restraint chairs for
forcefeeding, trained dogs, shackles, flex cuffs, goggles, and
hoods.]{.underline}

#### Multiple US companies produce torture devices

**Amnesty International '08** (Amnesty International is a global
movement of 2.2 million people in more than 150 countries and
territories who campaign to end grave abuses of human rights. © Amnesty

WEAPONS IN US LAW ENFORCEMENT '"

\[HS\]

Another company, [Stinger Systems]{.underline} ([based in Tampa,
Florida]{.underline}), has [recently introduced]{.underline} a [similar
projectile stun gun]{.underline} to the US market: the S-200. It [fires
two darts]{.underline} and is reported to produce around 60% of the peak
current of the X26 Taser; it can also be [operated as a touch-stun
gun]{.underline}. According to the Stinger Systems website, the trigger
of the S-200 can be set so that [the charge is controlled entirely by
the officer or to deliver an automatic two or four-second
charge]{.underline}. According to company press releases, S-200s have
been purchased by police departments in various states, including
Illinois, Missouri, Ohio, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin.19 [Stinger
Systems also produces other electro-shock products, including the
"Band-It" stun belt, a remote-controlled electrified sleeve]{.underline}
which can be placed on the leg or arm and is used for controlling
prisoners during transportation or when they are in public places (such
as a courthouse). According to the company's website[, the belt
"delivers an incapacitating electric shock" using a wireless remote up
to 175 feet]{.underline} (50 metres) away and can be operated manually
or be "set to go off automatically on movement".20 According to the
website, the Band-It has been used on "tens of thousands of prisoners
nationwide" by local and federal law enforcement agencies, including the
Federal Bureau of Prisons and the US Marshalls Service.21 [Amnesty
International opposes the use of such devices as inherently cruel and
degrading because the wearer is under constant fear of being subjected
to an electric shock for the whole time the belt is worn.]{.underline}22
[Taser International has developed another electro-shock projectile
weapon, the Taser XREP Extended-Range Electronic Projectile]{.underline}
(XREP), in which the electrodes are contained within a shell which can
be fired wire-free from a standard 12-gauge shotgun.23 When [the shell
hits the target, a probe pierces the skin or clothing and a wire falls
from the capsule to create another point of contact which
unleashes]{.underline} a 20-second cycle of the same [electrical
output]{.underline} as the TaserX26. The device was reportedly due to be
piloted in 2008.24 Amnesty International is particularly concerned by
the 20-second default shock built into the XREP, given the potential
adverse effects from prolonged CED exposure. The [company has also
developed the Taser Shockwave, described as an "area denial system"
which could be used for crowd control.]{.underline} The Shockwave, also
due to be piloted in 2008, consists of a unit of six Taser cartridges on
a stand which can be fired remotely from up to 100 feet away using a
control box. [Units can be stacked vertically or linked to form "chains"
--]{.underline} allowing an almost limitless number to be linked[. Each
unit can fire Taser cartridges singly or multiply and can hit several
targets]{.underline} at once when fired into a crowd. The cartridges
deliver a five-second electrical shock, which can be repeated at any
time with the push of a button.25 [This multiple firing capacity, with
its inherently indiscriminate effect, is also a cause for concern to
Amnesty International.]{.underline}

#### US provides most torture equipment govt action is key

**Martin and Wright 03**

(Brian Martin, AND Steve Wright, "Countershock: Mobilizing resistance to
electroshock weapons," Medicine, Conflict and Survival pp. 205-206,
<https://doi.org/10.1080/13623690308409692>) // WhtCbn

**[There is growing evidence that non-lethal weapons are not
benign]{.underline}** - indeed, they can be lethal - **[and are forming
a new arsenal used primarily against the exercise of
freedom]{.underline}**, rather than in defence of it.5 At an expert
briefing in October 2002 between Amnesty International, European
Commission officers, the Omega Foundation, police and medical experts
and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, participants were
told that **[there are 230 known manufacturers, distributors, suppliers
or brokers of electroshock weapons and 69 of leg irons, shackles or
thumbcuffs.]{.underline}** **[The]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[has the largest
number of companies providing restraint technology]{.underline}** (43),
followed by Western Europe (ten). Similarly, **[the US has the most
companies providing electroshock equipment]{.underline}** (81), followed
by the Asia-Pacific (56), Western Europe (41), Eastern-Central Europe
(23), Africa (11), the Middle East (ten) and Latin America (eight).6
Thus **[the West provides the largest share of the torture technology
supply pipeline with 77 per cent of the total companies actively
involved in the provision of restraint technology and over half of the
world\'s companies in the proliferation of electroshock
weapons]{.underline}**. Of course the number of companies is only one
part of the story: a single company might be making scores of thousands
of electroshock weapons**[. These weapons provide means for restraint
and torture, yet there are powerful corporate, government and public
relations forces seeking to present these weapons in a favourable
light]{.underline}** and, despite rhetoric about human rights, to carry
on business as usual. In such circumstances, it is important for
researchers to expose what is going on and investigate how these weapons
can best be opposed. Therefore, we start with the **[assumption that it
is important to oppose the production and trade in the technology of
repression]{.underline}**. The question is how to go about it. **[One
approach is through government regulation]{.underline}**. This can be
valuable, but it has seldom proved effective on its own. **[Nor does the
existence of international agreements about torture, on their own,
appear to achieve very much]{.underline}**. After all, **[no government
admits to using torture, yet it is known that dozens use or tolerate it
as a matter of policy]{.underline}**. The focus of this article is on
independent campaigning: a number of non-governmental organizations
(NGOs), such as Amnesty International and Campaign Against the Arms
Trade, play an important role in exposing and opposing the trade and use
of repression technologies.7 Our aim is to assess which sorts of
interventions are likely to be most effective in generating support and
action.

#### US companies hide as useful

**Martin and Wright 03**

(Brian Martin, AND Steve Wright, "Countershock: Mobilizing resistance to
electroshock weapons," Medicine, Conflict and Survival pp. 205-206,
<https://doi.org/10.1080/13623690308409692>) // WhtCbn

**[Companies that produce electroshock weapons commonly deny that their
products are used for repression]{.underline}**. What is the problem
with producing a technology if it is used for \'legitimate\' purposes?
In the Alice in Wonderland of definitions where words mean exactly what
a company spokesperson says they do, **[no one actually admits to making
torture technology or ever confesses to using it: ergo it does not
exist]{.underline}**. **[Many of the technologies used in torture have
other names]{.underline}**. Leg irons are called \'jumbo cuffs\' to get
around restrictions on exporting leg irons. Electroshock prods - what
Helen Bamber, founder of the United Kingdom Medical Foundation for
Victims of Torture, has called the \'universal tool of the torturer\' -
are in other security quarters simply called non-lethal weapons for
facilitating MOBILIZING RESISTANCE TO ELECTROSHOCK WEAPONS 213
\'compliance through pain\'. **[They might be sold to
women]{.underline}**, for example, **[as anti-rape
devices]{.underline}**. Indeed, some companies have only sold them for
such purposes and can back up that claim with evidence. **[Any effort to
make a universal claim for the undesirability of such technology will
undoubtedly draw legal fire from such \'legitimate\'
businesses.]{.underline}** **[The obvious counter to such claims is to
present evidence that specific weapons are sold to named repressive
regimes and used for torture.]{.underline}** It is especially powerful
when victims are willing to come forward and bear witness. If a
company\'s denial can be unmasked, people will be outraged. In other
words, countershock will be unleashed. In the UK, investigative
journalists have played a critical role in exposing corporate collusion.
Revelations surrounding The Torture Trail programme were incredibly
damaging to companies such as ICL Technical Plastics, Royal Ordnance and
Hiatt and COPEX and led eventually to political reform.21 Official data
sources can make for dry reading, but often contain valuable campaigning
data. In 1993 the Omega Foundation made a Freedom of Information request
via the Federation of American Scientists for the following export
administration codes: (OA82c) \* **[saps, thumbcuffs, thumbscrews, leg
irons, shackles and handcuffs, specially designed implements of torture,
straight jackets]{.underline}** etc. (OA84c) \* **[Stun guns, shock
batons, electric cattle prods and other immobilisation
guns]{.underline}**. **[The statistics from 1991-93 revealed that the US
Department of Commerce had approved over 350 export licences under
category OA82c and 2000 licences under category OA84c]{.underline}**.
The material released was highly embarrassing. Although the latter
category also included shotgun shells, people assumed that all the
licences were for electroshock weapons. The negative media coverage and
subsequent Amnesty reports persuaded the Department of Commerce to
further disaggregate these categories.

devices [produce high volume sounds]{.underline} at various frequencies,
with limited ability to target the sound to a particular area. Whilst
they can function as a loudhailer, and are often promoted as such, [they

discomfort, negatively affecting targets and causing behaviour
change]{.underline}. There are [concerns surrounding the use and
transfer of this equipment.]{.underline} These include: [a lack of
systematic independent research into the medical implications of the
devices]{.underline}; and the fact that [these devices are not yet
covered under current US export control regimes]{.underline}. As such,
[they are not subject to any oversight mechanism concerning
international trade]{.underline} or indeed, Federal excess equipment

on the]{.underline} Commerce Control List ([CCL]{.underline}) [and

Horrors. [The practice of torture is widespread]{.underline}, even in
countries that are close American allies, such as NATO member
[Turkey]{.underline}. That country has been [cited by the State
Department for a host of horrific practices, including administering
electric shock]{.underline}, dangling victims by their arms, and hanging
sandbags on prisoners\' necks. [Nevertheless, the Commerce Department
approved three licenses for exports of stun devices to
Turkey]{.underline} in 2001. Human-rights activists are outraged. \"How
could the United States possibly grant an export for electroshock
equipment transfers to Turkey,\" wonders Maureen Greenwood of Amnesty
International, \"when the State Department, Amnesty International, and
Turkish parliamentarians have all reported a pattern of torture
including electric shock?\" The answer[: The Commerce Department has
become little more than a rubber stamp for the more than 60 American
companies looking to ship devices overseas]{.underline}. In addition to
approving exports of electric-shock weapons, [Commerce also signed off
on the sale of restraint devices\--which could include thumb cuffs and
leg irons\--to countries where torture by authorities was reportedly
widespread. These countries include Egypt, Indonesia, Nigeria, Saudi
Arabia, and Venezuela.]{.underline} It is difficult, however, to trace a
specific device to a particular case of torture. [A U.S. company must
apply to the Commerce Department for a license if it wants to export
certain crime control equipment to any country except
Canada]{.underline}. Prior to 2000, licenses were not required for some
close allies, including Turkey. The department\'s \"general policy\"
when enforcing the Export Administration Act is to deny applications for
export to countries where there is a pattern of gross human-rights
violations. Commerce also states that it does not look favorably on an
application if there is civil disorder in the country. U.S. officials
say [all license applications and foreign importers are carefully
screened by the department]{.underline} as well as by other government
agencies. \"[The Departments of Commerce and State, and in some
instances Defense, review the proposed export\--the item, the end user,
and the country of destination\--to decide the likelihood that an item
will be used properly or misused]{.underline},\" says Matthew Borman, a
Commerce Department official. [Critics are also concerned about
companies that try to export without a license]{.underline}. U.S. News
found that [a handful of small companies freely advertise]{.underline}
on Web sites ways [to circumvent export rules for stun
guns]{.underline}. The [department requires companies to obtain licenses
to export the components of shock weapons]{.underline}. But businesses
such as SelfDefence.com will sell a stun gun \"kit,\" in which the parts
are shipped separately. The Web site declares: \"We have been highly
successful in clearing them through foreign customs.\" Lee Norris runs
the company out of his home with his wife in rural Browntown, Va. He
says the kits are legal to export. \"It\'s funny how those laws work,\"
says Norris. Commerce officials, alerted to the practice by U.S. News,
weren\'t amused\--and promise to investigate. Jolt[. Companies argue
that the restraints and shock devices are standard police gear and that
they cannot be held responsible if the equipment is
misused]{.underline}. Tom Smith, the president and co-founder of Taser
International, says he and his brother, Rick, started selling stun
equipment to help stop gun violence. Two of Rick Smith\'s high school
friends were gunned down in a road-rage incident in Scottsdale, Ariz.,
Tom says. In 1994, the brothers began making stun devices\--called
tasers\--later marketing them to police as \"less lethal\" alternatives
to guns. The company\'s bestselling product fires two barbed darts up to
21 feet and jolts its target with 50,000 volts of electricity. A person
at the receiving end is immobilized for several seconds. Police
departments in cities like Phoenix, Seattle, and Los Angeles are
customers. Company revenues hit \$9.8 million in 2002, up from \$6.9
million the year before. [Total exports of shock weapons and restraints
approved by the United States in 2002 were worth \$19 million, according
to Commerce. The Scottsdale-based company has exported tasers to 59
countries. Several have been cited for torture by the State Department,
including India, Peru, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey]{.underline}. \"There is
no proof our products are used to torture people,\" says Smith. In June,
[Taser closed a deal to sell more than 3,300 tasers worth \$1.5 million
to the United Arab Emirates]{.underline} Armed Forces; that country
hasn\'t been cited for torture. Human-rights advocates admit that
security weapons have legitimate uses. But the [devices can be
misused]{.underline}, too, says Allen Keller, a medical doctor and
director of the Bellevue/NYU Program for Survivors of Torture. \"How can
one ensure that these won\'t be used to torture someone?\" Keller asks.
His [clinic has treated more than 1,000 torture victims, including some
from countries where the Commerce Department approved
licenses.]{.underline} It\'s virtually impossible to say if a specific
shipment of stun guns or leg shackles from the United States was later
used for torture. Many countries export such devices. For proprietary
reasons, [the Commerce Department does not reveal the names of U.S.
companies that receive licenses, or their customers]{.underline}. But
critics warn that U.S. exports\--even legitimate ones\--could easily
fall into the wrong hands without tighter enforcement. For instance[,
handcuffs made by Peerless Handcuff]{.underline}, a Springfield, Mass.,
company, [were found in a Lebanese prison]{.underline} in 2000,
according to Amnesty International. The company says it does not export
to Lebanon. Amnesty reports that Smith & Wesson handcuffs were found to
have been used in 1999 to torture detainees in Saudi Arabia.

### Torture is Bad -- Stress

#### Electric devices produce excruciating pain and stress

2 (III) PAIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF ELECTRO-SHOCK WEAPONS Although
the peak voltage is high, the amount of electrical output delivered by
CEDs is described as well below the threshold normally required to
directly trigger a fatal electrical shock. While, as this report shows,
serious questions remain concerning the safety thresholds of such
weapons[, it is undisputed from the testimony of those who have
experienced even a short shock, including police officers, that they
cause substantial pain]{.underline}. One police chief, for example, who
volunteered to undergo a two-second Taser shock during a training
session while being physically supported by two other officers,
described the experience as "[very painful \...there are shock waves
going through your body. It's a very scary feeling]{.underline}".31
Another officer described the pain as "By far[, the most excruciating
pain anyone can feel]{.underline}".32 A reporter who volunteered to be
shocked said [it was "like someone reached]{.underline} into my body [to
rip my muscles apart]{.underline} with a fork".33 Most officers or
others who volunteer to take a Taser "hit" are shocked for less than the
minimum five-second charge usually applied in the field. Some
departments have reportedly stopped requiring officers to take a shock
during training, because of complaints about the effects and some
injuries.34 In many departments officers may now choose whether or not
to be shocked during training. [The psychological effects of
uncontrollable muscle contractions and collapse can be distressing and
frightening as well as painful]{.underline}. Taser International's
product warning bulletins acknowledge that use of t[he Taser can cause
"pain, stress, and/or panic" and that anticipation of such exposure can
cause "stress, trepidation, panic, and/or fear]{.underline}" [which may
be injurious]{.underline} to some people.35 These effects in Amnesty
International's view make such weapons particularly inappropriate in the
case of vulnerable individuals, such as children, people with mental
illness, the elderly or pregnant women, unless officers are faced with
an immediate threat of death or serious injury that cannot be contained
by any lesser means. As described below, however, CEDs have been used
against such individuals when they were reportedly not posing a serious
threat.

Considering the impact on victims, it is important to realise that
**[torture]{.underline}** in spite of the clear legal definition
frequently **[is not a "simple" event]{.underline}** \[8\]. While **[in
some cases a short instance of violence is experienced]{.underline}**,
which can potentially be integrated by good coping strategies,
**[torture]{.underline}** can be and **[is frequently part of a lengthy
suffering lasting in the worst case over years or life-long and might
include traumatic experiences]{.underline}** like the murder of friends
or the inability to fulfil obligations to support and protect ones
family while imprisoned due to exile or due to physical or psychological
injuries received. **[It is]{.underline}** further **[frequently
embedded in exposure to other forms of violence and persecution outside
of imprisonment including discrimination, bereavement, war or civil war
and socio-politico-economic marginalisation.]{.underline}** Torture in
concentration camps is an example of such extreme settings of torture
and can be said to first have been demonstrated to be **[followed by
severe long-term impact even in the second and third
generations]{.underline}** \[9, 10\]. Recent data have demonstrated
epigenetic alterations evident in both exposed parents and offspring of
violence and torture \[11\]. Thus, extreme life experiences may also
interact with the cultural background, for example, when **[religious or
cultural rules are intentionally violated to humiliate the
victim]{.underline}**, **[as in the case of Abu Ghraib]{.underline}**
\[12\].Torture is used in many countries indiscriminately against any
criminal in police stations or prisons, but also against members of the
political opposition, **[and torture can lead to the death of the
victim.]{.underline}** Consequently it is not possible to speak of "the
torture survivor" in the most general terms nor is it possible to
describe a homogenous "torture syndrome" \[13\]. A holistic
understanding of the individual and his/her experience is required to
reflect the complexity of possible factors. Posttraumatic stress
disorder (**[PTSD) has been demonstrated to be the most
common]{.underline}** specific and common mental disorder after torture
\[4, 8, 14\]. PTSD can affect up to nearly all members of highly exposed
groups and **[can affect survivors on a long-term basis even decades
after torture]{.underline}** \[15, 16\], as also documented in
concentration camp survivors as the group with the so far longest
follow-up period \[17\]. PTSD is presently seen in evolutionary
psychology \[18\] as a maladaptive development of an in-principle
adaptive pattern, an understanding that can also be used to explain the
symptoms experienced to victims in a way that is not stigmatising, the
last being a major risk in the psychiatric care of victims in societies
where mental health problems are still stigmatised. The recent changes
in DSM-5 now include "complex" symptoms that have been described as
frequent in torture survivors, such as **[dissociative symptoms and
shame and survivor guilt feelings]{.underline}** \[19\], which are
**[common problems in torture survivors with a significant impact on
long-term symptoms]{.underline}** \[20\]. This should not lead to a too
simplified focus in research and treatment. **[Major depression is
nearly as common in victims]{.underline}** \[21\], **[and chronic
pain]{.underline}** is an important and often treatment-resistant
problem \[22, 23\]. This can reflect chronic injuries caused by torture
with specific sequels including but not limited to chronic pain, such as
those resulting from falanga (beatings to the sole of the feet \[24\]).
Psychological and cultural factors like idioms of distress as discussed
later on \[25, 26\] can also affect presentation of torture sequels.
Comorbidity can be expected to adversely affect the long-term course by
interaction of specific problems like chronic pain, brain trauma and
PTSD \[27, 28\], and this in turn **[can lead to increased risk of
complications including suicidal ideation or suicide]{.underline}**
\[29, 30\] or substance abuse as self-help strategy \[31, 32\]. The ICD
10 included the important category "Enduring personality change after
catastrophic experiences" (F 62.0) referring to complex torture as in
concentration camp experiences \[33, 34\]. It is to be hoped that this
category will be included in ICD 11 in spite of the still limited data
and not subsumed in complex PTSD. In children, who can be direct or
indirect victims, a wider range of symptoms have been observed, and
DSM-5 has included extended definitions of PTSD for that group, though
sequels are again not limited to PTSD. The term developmental trauma
disorder (DTD) has been proposed to explain the various PTSD symptoms in
children that might reflect the influence of on age, support
availability, gender or the repeated nature of the trauma exposure. The
term "toxic stress" has also been fronted by researchers to explain
complex torture sequels in children. Disability due to physical and
psychological factors can be severe \[35, 36\], and sexual and family
functioning are frequently significantly impaired \[37\]. Resilience
factors and coping strategies can modify outcome \[16, 38\], but severe
torture must be expected to affect all survivors especially under
adverse conditions including children.

## 2AC -- Ilaw Adv

### 2AC -- US Sets Norms

#### US sets precedent of torture norms, other norms proves.

**EVANGELISTA 06**

(Matthew A., President White Professor of History and Political Science
teaches international and comparative politics @ Cornell, MA and PhD in
Government from Cornell, and an undergraduate degree in Russian History
and Literature from Harvard, "THE U.S. AND THE NORMS OF INTERNATIONAL
HUMANITARIAN LAW," Crossroads, Vol. 6, No. 1, pp. 12-16) // WhtCbn

In any case, **[the US government]{.underline}** and armed forces have
**[set a worrying precedent in dealing with charges of abuse and torture
of detainees around the world: prosecuting the small fry and letting off
the hook the senior military and political leaders who formulated the
policies that contributed to the crimes]{.underline}**. If its
government and military establishment do not abide by the rule of law,
the United States will find it very difficult to make the case that
other countries should do so. One can already observe the impact of the
U.S. precedents in other areas of international law. Consider, for
example, how **[the US government has embraced a preventive-war doctrine
both in its official pronouncements and in practice in
Iraq]{.underline}** (Evangelista, Fanis, Strauss, Kirshner 2003).
Russian President Vladimir **[Putin]{.underline}**, for example, has
**[declared that his country has the right to attack neighboring states
such as Georgia or Ukraine, if it finds that they are harboring
terrorists]{.underline}** who might pose a threat to the Russian
Federation. The chief of the Russian General Staff went even further,
indicating that Russia could launch preemptive strikes on terrorist
bases anywhere. \"Speaking of preemptive strikes," he said, "Russia will
take all necessary steps for destroying terrorist bases in any part of
the world. However," he added reassuringly, "it does not mean that we
are going to use nuclear weapons during counterterrorist operations1.
The Bush administration, by contrast, has advocated creating a new type
of nuclear weapon, the so-called Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator,
precisely in order to destroy deep underground facilities that might
harbor terrorists or weapons of mass destruction2. This is another area
where the relaxing of norms -- in this case **[the taboo against using
nuclear weapons for purposes other than deterrence]{.underline}** of a
nuclear attack -- sets **[a bad precedent and increases the risk of
nuclear proliferation]{.underline}** (Tannenwald 2006). **[Another
example]{.underline}** concerns **[the use of white
phosphorous]{.underline}** by the US armed forces in Iraq. When it is
used as an obscuring agent to create a cloud of fog or to illuminate
objects, white phosphorous is not considered a chemical weapon and is
therefore not illegal according to the Paris Convention on chemical
arms. In this case, however, there is evidence that the US army used
white phosphorous directly against Iraqi rebels in Falluja, risking a
violation of the Convention. **[It would not be surprising if other
countries followed the American example, taking advantage of a gray area
in the Convention itself and undermining its effectiveness in the long
run]{.underline}**. 1Let me conclude with two comments linked to the
themes with which I began: **[mines and torture]{.underline}**. I will
make an observation on mines and a prediction about torture. Regarding
mines, how are the norms constituting the Ottawa Treaty doing? The good
news is that only four governments have conducted new mine-laying
operations since early 2003: Russia, Myanmar, Nepal and Georgia. The bad
news is that the United States is poised to join them. As the result of
a policy review in February 2004, the United States is likely to violate
the ban, by producing new weapons, continuing to stockpile old ones, and
by deploying landmines in Iraq3. In September 2005, the New York Daily
News reported that the Pentagon was ready to take the decision to build
new mines. Although clearly a setback for the treaty, this decision
nevertheless reflects the influence of the anti-mine norms that produced
the Ottawa accord. How so? As the newspaper put it, "underscoring the
unpopularity of the devices, defense officials working on the program,
called Spider, decline to call the weapon a land mine, opting instead
for generic descriptions such as 'networked munitions'" (New York Daily
News 2005). So officials in the Pentagon recognize a normative stigma
against landmines at least enough not to want to say out loud that they
are producing a new one -- and this, even though it would be completely
legal for the United States to produce land mines, because the United
States never signed the Mine Ban Treaty. Perhaps we can call this a
minor rhetorical victory in the midst of a potential major setback --
**[the resumption of production of landmines by the United States. It
could set a precedent by which other states would deploy mines, merely
using other names such as networked munitions.]{.underline}** Certainly
it is possible that other countries and armed groups might not follow
the US example. Recently we have seen an exception to the
generalization: The Polisario Front, the independence movement fighting
against Morocco for control of the Western Sahara, has declared its
intention not to use mines anymore and has begun the destruction of its
arsenal -- an apparent effort to gain international sympathy for its
cause. In this article I have expressed a concern **[that certain US
practices might create precedents that would redound to the disadvantage
of everyone]{.underline}**. This is a view that Henry Shue has
articulated in respect to torture, so I would like to conclude with his
argument. He writes: "**[We have no guarantee that a precedent of
refraining from torture will be followed by others, but we can be sure
that a precedent of engaging in torture will be
followed]{.underline}**." He imagines the response of leaders of small
countries and armed groups: \"**[If the world\'s superpower, with all
its high technology weapons, cannot defend itself without using torture,
how can incomparably weaker and poorer groups like us manage without
torturing captured fighters who might provide valuable life-saving
information]{.underline}**?\" He continues: "**[Torture seems to be the
ultimate in efficiency, the shortcut to end all
shortcuts.]{.underline}** It is difficult enough to resist when you
would be the exception if you gave in. When you would simply be
following the leader, the precedent is irresistible" (Shue 2003). **[If
the current American behavior,]{.underline}** rather than the efforts of
nongovernmental organizations, **[shapes the norms and laws that govern
the conduct of war]{.underline}**, the **[implications for the
international system and for our ethical standards could be very
serious.]{.underline}**

#### US set the justification for torture

**Shue 03**

(Henry, senior research fellow at Merton College, Oxford. "The Debate on
Torture; War Against Virtual States; RESPONSES," Dissent Philadelphia,
Vol. 50, Issue 3, pp. 90) // WhtCbn

An initial reason why the **[United States should never engage in
torture is precedent]{.underline}**. When I heard that U.S. military
personnel bravely and professionally performing their duties in the U.S.
and British invasion of Iraq had been captured, my first thought was,
\"I hope they are not tortured.\" We have no guarantee that a precedent
of refraining from torture will be followed by others, but **[we can be
sure that a precedent of engaging in torture will be
followed]{.underline}**. \"**[If the world\'s superpower,]{.underline}**
with all its high technology weapons, **[cannot defend itself without
using torture, how can incomparably weaker and poorer groups like us
manage without torturing captured fighters who might provide valuable
life-saving information?\"]{.underline}** Torture seems to be the
ultimate in efficiency, the shortcut to end all shortcuts. It is
difficult enough to resist when you would be the exception if you gave
in. When you would simply be following the leader, the precedent is
irresistible. More frightening than the permissive power of precedent is
that for the United States to use torture would undermine its logic in
condemning terrorism. **[How could we condemn all terrorism while
permitting some torture? Any sane defense of torture attempts to justify
only the exceptional act in the extreme emergency.]{.underline}** For
some terrorists, **[extremity is not necessary; terror is a way of life,
just as torture is a way of life for some torturers,]{.underline}** and
it is easy to explain why neither terrorism nor torture should be a way
of life. But what about \"selective terrorists\" for whom this cause is
noble, this situation desperate, and this possible payoff enormous? If
those circumstances justify \"selective torture\" (by the most powerful
state in human history), why don\'t they justify \"selective terrorism\"
by profoundly threatened true believers? **[Justifications for torture
thrive in fantasy]{.underline}**. **[We imagine we have exactly the
person we need]{.underline}**\--not some poor devil who looks like him
to agents who have parachuted in from another culture. We **[imagine
that the person we hold knows exactly what we need to
know]{.underline}**\--not out-of-date information overtaken by events.
We imagine that the person will reveal exactly what we need\--not simply
vomit and die, or descend into a psychotic state (of course torturers
become better at it when they have more practice). **[We imagine that
the information that will be revealed will be sufficient to prevent the
terrible catastrophe]{.underline}**\--not that the catastrophe will
simply be re-scheduled for a different time or place**[. It is as easy
to imagine the perfect torture as it is the perfect
murder]{.underline}**. The question is, what guidance do such imaginings
provide for the real world in which things tend to go awry and to have
unexpected consequences? No doubt there have been perfect murders,
possibly also perfect tortures in which only some temporary degrading
treatment of only a few people yielded spectacularly valuable
information that prevented horrific catastrophes. But the question is
whether public policy should presume the likelihood of these imagined
neat cost/benefit bonanzas or the greater likelihood of snafu, excess,
and metastasizing degradation. For **[the ultimate reason not to inflict
agony upon other human beings is that it is degrading to all involved:
all become less human]{.underline}**. The Washington Post documented on
December 26, 2002, that **[the U.S. government currently subcontracts
the most awful torture to its supposedly less civilized allies, such as
the governments of Morocco and Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**. One could
have a nice philosophical argument about whether it is more contemptible
to arrange for third parties to do the dirty work or to act on one\'s
supposed convictions and dirty one\'s own hands. Either way**[, ultimate
responsibility lies with those who give the order]{.underline}**, even
if they can only bring themselves to whisper and wink. Perhaps the
pitiful U.S. efforts at \"deniability\" are a tiny, hopeful sign of
surviving conscience.

The representative [of Egypt said]{.underline} his [delegation would
have liked to join consensus on "L.94" had it been accurate enough in
dealing with the main objective of putting an end to the trade of
torture goods]{.underline}. However, his [delegation has reservations on
several issues relating to its provisions and the way in which it was
tabled]{.underline} today. [Not enough time was allocated for
discussions and negotiations. This sets a serious precedent in the
handling of human rights issues at the General Assembly]{.underline}, he
continued, reiterating the co-sponsors' failure to take into account the
views of Member States. "Our main reservation is reflected in the text's
possible impacts on international trade," he said. In addition, "[L.94"
links torture and other forms of inhuman treatment to capital
punishment, which many Member States have objected to]{.underline}.
States have the sovereign right to apply capital punishment for the most
heinous crimes, he said. The representative of [Jamaica]{.underline},
noting that her delegation would vote against "L.94", [expressed concern
about setting a precedent for restricting countries from conducting
trade]{.underline}. [This could heavily impact a country like Jamaica
that heavily depends on trade]{.underline}. [Other General Assembly
draft resolutions that provide parameters on torture and inhuman
treatment also emphasize that every sovereign country has the right to
implement its own law]{.underline}. The draft does not sufficiently
address or take into consideration amendments tabled by many Member
States during deliberations. Moreover, the draft resolution envisions
the establishment of a group of experts to establish international
standards, she said, adding that this group is unlikely to be
representative of the views of those who expressed concern over the
points that, in the end, were included in "L.94". The representative of
Sudan pointed out that several paragraphs refer to capital punishment, a
controversial topic that has yet to find consensus in the Main
Committees of the General Assembly. Because capital punishment is a
matter that is subject to the national legislation of many countries,
[Sudan will oppose the draft resolution]{.underline}. The representative
of [the United States]{.underline}, [emphasizing that her country does
not take trade policy direction from the Assembly, said further
restrictions on material used for capital punishment are inconsistent
with international law. As such, her delegation will vote
against]{.underline} "L.94".

3.2.1 ELECTRIC SHOCK WEAPONS PROJECTILE ELECTRIC SHOCK WEAPONS
[Projectile electric shock weapons fire darts]{.underline} -- connected
by electrical wires to the launch device -- at an individual and can be
used from a distance of several metres. The [darts attach to a person's
body, delivering an incapacitating high-voltage electric shock that
causes the subject to lose muscle control]{.underline} (neuro-muscular
incapacitation). Projectile electric shock weapons should be strictly
limited to "standoff" situations where the only alternative is the use
of lethal force or firearms when an officer is facing or trying to
prevent an imminent threat of death or serious injury. Regulations
should require officers to avoid additional shocks and prohibit
continuous or simultaneous shocks with multiple weapons. Regulations
should also prohibit the use of such weapons on subjects who are
restrained, and on individuals who are more vulnerable, including
children, the elderly, and pregnant women. [Certain projectile electric
shock weapons also incorporate a direct contact electric shock
mode]{.underline} (also called drive-stun), [where the weapon is held
against the body of an individual and the electric shock applied
directly, without firing the projectiles. The drive-stun mode causes
pain but does not create neuro-muscular incapacitation of the
individual, allowing the weapon to be employed as a de facto direct
contact electric shock weapon. This capability is prone to abuse,
including for torture and other ill-treatment, and therefore this
capability should be banned and removed from the design of these weapons
intended for law enforcement.]{.underline}

#### Not selling torture devices key to stop torture trade

**Amnesty International 17**

("TACKLING THE TRADE IN TOOLS OF TORTURE AND EXECUTION TECHNOLOGIES,"
pp. 20) // WhtCbn

Although every State has the obligation to combat torture and other
ill-treatment, concrete action by States has generally been inadequate.
To end this trade in "tools of torture" and execution technologies,
Amnesty International and the Omega Research Foundation are calling on
all States to incorporate in their legal and administrative frameworks
the following five principles: **[1. A ban on the production of, and
trade in, inherently inhumane law enforcement equipment and related
training]{.underline}**; and specifically designed execution
technologies. **[The prohibited goods list should include at a minimum
direct-contact electric shock devices; spiked batons; thumb-screws and
thumb-cuffs; neck cuffs; weighted leg or hand restraints; leg or hand
restraints for attachment to fixed objects; restraint chairs,
shackle-boards and shackle-beds; cage beds; and execution equipment.
2]{.underline}**. Strict, risk-based **[restrictions on the trade in law
enforcement equipment that could be easily misused for torture and other
ill-treatment,]{.underline}** including, for instance, plastic and
rubber bullets; electric shock projectile weapons (Tasers); and riot
control agents and appropriate means of delivery. Similar controls need
to be established to ensure that certain dual use drugs which have
legitimate medical usages are not employed for "lethal injection"
executions. 3. A comprehensive national trade control system to vet
prospective transfers of controlled equipment taking into account
relevant information derived from UN, regional and national human rights
monitors and NGOs, relating to the activities of the proposed law
enforcement end users, in particular their compliance with human rights
law and standards. 36 See for example, United Nations, General Assembly,
66th Session, Third Committee, Torture and other cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment or punishment, A/C.3/66/L.28 Rev 1, 8th November
2011, paragraph 24. CONCLUSIONS: COMBATTING THE TRADE IN TORTURE AND
EXECUTION TECHNOLOGIES 20 TACKLING THE TRADE IN TOOLS OF TORTURE AND
EXECUTION TECHNOLOGIES Amnesty International \| Omega Research
Foundation 4. Reporting and information sharing on the trade in "tools
of torture and execution technologies". States should inform their
legislature and share information with other States about measures taken
to regulate the trade in law enforcement equipment and technical
assistance. They should publish a publicly available annual report in a
timely manner containing meaningful information on the volume, value,
nature of equipment, and destination of their trade in this area, so as
to enable appropriate oversight by elected representatives, civil
society and independent bodies. 5. **[Regional and international
measures to regulate the trade in "tools of torture and capital
punishment".]{.underline}** Establishing effective national measures to
regulate the trade in law enforcement equipment and technical
assistance, though vital, will not be sufficient to ensure that law
enforcement agencies engaged in torture and other ill-treatment do not
continue to receive the "tools of torture" from unscrupulous exporters
in other countries. To combat such activities, inter-governmental
organizations should establish regional, and eventually international,
standards and instruments regulating trade in this area.

circumstances]{.underline}**. Yet despite this, **[tools of death and
pain are still traded across the globe]{.underline}**. These **[include
batons with metal spikes, electric shock belts, and grabbers that seize
people by the waist or limb while electrocuting them, chemicals used to
execute people and the forced injection systems that go with
them]{.underline}**. \"These products serve no other purpose than
inflicting terrible pain and killing people. **[We should never permit
that they are traded like any other commodity. It\'s time for concrete
action to shut down this despicable trade]{.underline}**,\" said
Commissioner Malmstrom. \"**[The EU\'s own laws in this field have had
positive results, but producers of these goods try to get around such
legislation.]{.underline}** The more countries that sign up to
cooperate, the more effective we will be. During my time as Commissioner
and Member of the European Parliament, I have met victims of torture on
many occasions - refugees, prisoners of conscience, death row inmates. I
am convinced that **[trade policy can be a way to strengthen human
rights around the globe]{.underline}**.\", Commissioner Malmstrom added.
The launch on 18 September at the UN headquarters is the result of a
joint effort between the EU, Argentina and Mongolia, and will see
countries signing up to a joint political declaration (the website of
the Alliance - www.torturefreetrade.org - is now online). Some 50 UN
member countries in total are expected to join on launch day, from
around the globe - Africa, the Americas, Asia and Europe. The Alliance
could become a basis for broader UN cooperation in this field. By
signing up to the Alliance, countries will be agreeing to the four
action points: \* **[Take measures to control and restrict exports of
these goods]{.underline}**; \* Equip customs authorities with
appropriate tools. The Alliance will set up a platform to **[monitor
trade flows, exchange information, and identify new
products]{.underline}**; \* **[Make technical assistance available to
help countries with setting up and implementing laws to ban this
trade]{.underline}**; \* **[Exchange practices for efficient control and
enforcement systems]{.underline}**. The EU is committed to protecting
human rights, and to the fight against torture and the abolition of the
death penalty. The EU\'s tough legislation on trade in goods used for
torture or the death penalty has already reaped results. Partly as a
consequence of tougher EU rules, drugs for lethal injections have become
more difficult to get and more expensive to buy. But **[EU legislation
only applies in Europe]{.underline}**. **[Producers and traders of these
goods try to circumvent EU laws, so the more countries that commit
themselves to banning their export, the more effective efforts will be
to put an end to the trade.]{.underline}** The Alliance is a way to take
concrete action and specific steps to stop the trade in such goods
globally, making it significantly more difficult to obtain them. One of
the aims of the EU\'s foreign policy is to promote respect for
fundamental rights. Its commitment to stopping torture and abolishing
capital punishment includes since 2005 measures to prevent the trade in
goods that could be used for capital punishment or torture or other
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. **[The EU lists banned products
and provides for a fast-track mechanism to make sure that new products
can also be banned. It has in place rules for export controls to prevent
listed medicinal products from being used for capital punishment, bans
supplying brokering services related to any listed goods, and technical
support to third countries]{.underline}**. Last year, the EU tightened
its legislation even further to make sure it includes a ban on transit
through EU territory and in ports, and promotion, such as at trade fairs

These products adopted by the Wassenaar Arrangement entered into force
in the EU on 31 December 2014, meaning that **[EU Member States were
required to regulate the export of goods in these
categories]{.underline}**. While considerable challenges in the
implementation of these controls were acknowledged by the participating
states, in particular ensuring an accurate definition of the relevant
software and more broadly regulating something as easily (re-)
distributable as software, **[the controls were nevertheless implemented
by numerous EU Member States across Europe]{.underline}**. The **[goal
of the addition of the new entries to the Control List was to prevent
such equipment or technologies being used as means of
repression]{.underline}** and state surveillance **[and resulting in
human rights violations]{.underline}**. However, especially the last
control on targeted surveillance technologies was heavily contested by
the information security community as being too broad. Numerous experts
suggested that the targeted surveillance technologies control would also
catch typical information security technologies, in particular 4.E.1.c,
which is defined as 'Technology' for the 'development' of 'intrusion
software'.The intrusion software clause was heavily criticised by Bratus
et al., 21 Eleanor Saitta22 and Dullien et al., 23 as part of a public
consultation by the US Department of Commerce on the US implementation
of the proposed changes to the Wassenaar Arrangement. While **[part of
the criticism stems from the very broad implementation of Wassenaar
proposed by the US Department of Commerce]{.underline}**, which went far
beyond the initial controls proposed within the Wassenaar Arrangement,
it was also related to the controls proposed by Wassenaar itself**[.
This negative response led the US delegation to Wassenaar to
successfully renegotiate this control]{.underline}** in December 2017,
as a result of which **[the scope of the revision of existing controls
was considerably limited]{.underline}**.24 Notably, **[the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[has]{.underline}** to

Introduction "**[They say passing a kidney stone is the worst pain you
could ever have. They're wrong. Sure it was bad]{.underline}**. I
remember whimpering like a baby in the Emergency Room. **[But it was a
joke compared to this pain which never passes. It just keeps on going
and eating me up inside]{.underline}**. I still feel it now, intense as
ever, 10 years later." Dan **[Vento is talking about the time his
daughter suffered a relapse of]{.underline}** an uncommon form of
**[cancer]{.underline}** called osteosarcoma. **[Jennifer was
nine]{.underline}**, the youngest of his three daughters. Dan and his
wife Mary thought they had weathered the storm. The initial round of
chemotherapy seemed to work. But a year later, Jennifer's left knee
began to swell and hurt again, then her thigh, then her back. The cancer
not only had returned but was now all over Jennifer's body, and it had
happened so quickly that even the doctors were caught off guard.
Naturally the Ventos tried everything, even a bone marrow transplant.
But the cancer could not be stopped. Metastatic tumors invaded
Jennifer's bones, obstructed her airways and destroyed her vision.
Overnight, their little girl had become unrecognizable, from the cancer
and from the aggressive treatments---a swollen, lumpy mass with tubes
and IV lines hooked up to beeping machines. The worse part was that
there was nothing they could do to help. They stood by, feeling as if
the cancer were ripping through their bones too. **[Less than 2 months
after the relapse Jennifer died]{.underline}**. It was almost a relief
at first; the Ventos couldn't bear watching their daughter suffer
another day. But when they saw Jennifer in the little coffin, when they
saw the coffin lowered into the ground, when they saw the earth covering
the coffin---from that day on, their pain would never end. "I tried to
be strong for my wife and kids," Dan Vento explained. "If they saw me
crumble, how would they be able to keep going?" But despite the strong
facade, Vento was crumbling. "I felt weak and lightheaded all the time,
like I might pass out, and needed to grab onto something---a chair, the
wall, anything---to keep from falling." Vento had always been tough.
Though not physically imposing---he was short and stocky---he was a
self-made man from the Bronx who owned a successful chain of grocery
stores and always got whatever he wanted, at work and at home. When
Jennifer died, however, he didn't seem to want much anymore and found it
increasingly difficult to concentrate. **[His life began to unravel.
There was only pain]{.underline}**. Diverging Views **[Is
what]{.underline}** Dan **[Vento experienced]{.underline}**--as he
watched his daughter suffer, when he buried her, and now, 10 years
later, still entangled in grief---**[pain? He certainly thinks
so]{.underline}** and uses the word just as he did when he spent an
agonizing night in the ER with kidney stones. **[So do many other people
who undergo similar trauma]{.underline}**, as well as those who suffer
"pain" in psychiatric illnesses like depression and schizophrenia.
**[Most professionals, however, would disagree. Scientists who study
pain and doctors who treat pain consider the experience a strictly
physical phenomenon, in the sense that it can only be caused by injury
to the body]{.underline}**. Pain occurs when receptors on nerve cells in
the skin and internal organs detect potentially damaging stimuli, a
pinrick, for example, or high temperatures (Melzack and Wall 1983, pp.
81--108). The nociceptors (from the Latin nocere, to injure) then signal
the brain, which assesses the threat and coordinates a series of
protective responses. We pull the arm away from the flame; we rest the
broken leg. This highly effective biological warning system that
prevents further damage and aids in healing is something we can't live
very well without. Just think of patients who are unable to feel pain,
those with genetic defects and those with diseases that affect nerve
transmission like diabetes and leprosy; the benefits of life without
pain are easily outweighed by the negatives of progressive injury to the
body and premature death (see Brand and Yancey 1997). Dan **[Vento has
suffered no physical injury. Nor have patients who experience the
psychic pain that accompanies acute depression. Nor have cancer patients
(and their parents) who experience the overwhelming fear and anxiety and
isolation that accompany the physical symptoms of their
illnesses]{.underline}**. Their nociceptors, at least with respect to
these particular feelings, remain silent, sending no distress signal to
the brain. Therefore, **[their feelings are]{.underline}** not really
pain but something categorically different, **[what the professionals
prefer to call suffering or anguish]{.underline}** (Cassell 1991, pp.
30--46). And therefore, one will find no mention of grief or depression
in medical classification schemes of pain. Even psychiatrists are wary
of speaking about pain in their patients, reserving it only for those
rare and strange cases of psychogenic pain or somatoform pain
disorder---that is, physical-like pain localized to a part of the body
that has not been injured, the modern-day equivalent to what Freud
termed hysteria or conversion reaction (DSM 3, rev.; American
Psychiatric Association 1987). The bottom line is that the psychological
pain experienced by Dan Vento and millions of patients with acute
depression is an oxymoron or, at best, a metaphor. It simply does not
exist.1 The Subjective Argument How can there be such a gulf between the
layperson and the expert, especially with regard to such a common part
of life? And if the experts are right, how could ordinary people like
Dan Vento as well as our language professionals---celebrated writers
like William Styron and Joan Didion, for example, who wrote so
eloquently about pain in depression (Darkness Visible) and grief (The
Year of Magical Thinking)---have gotten things so wrong? Unless of
course they haven't. Unless **[it's not the layperson but the expert who
is confused]{.underline}**. Perhaps **[one's instinctive tendency to see
pain more broadly, as a category that incorporates both physical and
psychological varieties, may be more enlightened than the expert's
narrower conception]{.underline}**. Perhaps **[[there are good reasons
for speaking of pain in]{.mark} the setting of [grief or depression
or]{.mark} schizophrenia or [divorce or]{.mark} the [nonphysical
suffering]{.mark} that accompanies illness]{.underline}**. Let's examine
the evidence. In the first place, **[[there is a wealth of subjective
evidence]{.mark}---what people feel and think and then convey to others
through language. When we ask [people]{.mark} about certain aversive
emotional experiences and listen to their words, we find that they not
only use the generic word "pain" to label these experiences, but also
[describe them in the same ways they describe physical
pain]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Now pain of any kind is notoriously
difficult to express. There are problems conceptualizing the experience
because it is perceptually inaccessible (we can't see or touch pain) and
because, unlike other inner states, it is not always linked to external
objects that we can see or touch (like the person who makes us angry or
the dog that makes us scared) (Scarry 1985, pp. 161--162; Biro 2010, pp.
11--47). As a result, one is forced to think about pain indirectly,
through metaphor: we imagine a more knowable object linked to the pain
and then speak of the experience in terms of that object. **[By far the
most common metaphor used to describe physical pain is the
weapon]{.underline}** (Scarry 1985, pp. 15--19). **[We say that a pain
is shooting or stabbing]{.underline}**. Lengthy lists of similar
adjectives can be found on the McGill Pain Questionnaire, created in the
1970s to help patients communicate their feelings to doctors. **[Pain
can be described as piercing, drilling, burning, grinding, throbbing,
stinging, squeezing, and so on. Each of the descriptors implies the
presence of a weapon or weapon-like object that can injure the
body]{.underline}**---the drill that drills, the fire that burns. And
**[since most patients have never been stabbed or shot or are not being
stabbed or shot at the moment of pain, they are using these terms
figuratively to objectify what would otherwise be difficult to pin down
and represent; now they could see pain and describe how it feels by
talking about knives and guns and the damage they can do the
body]{.underline}**. **[People with psychological pain use the very same
metaphors to describe their experiences]{.underline}**. Dan **[Vento,
silenced for so long by the incapacitating pain of loss]{.underline}**,
will eventually open up to a psychiatrist. It **[felt like a
bomb]{.underline}**, he explained, **[that exploded
inside]{.underline}** of **[him]{.underline}**, **[obliterating
everything]{.underline}** in his body. At other times, **[he
felt]{.underline}** the damage was occurring more slowly and
methodically, **[as if there were a swarm of parasites eating away at
his organs]{.underline}**. But either way, **[the result
was]{.underline}** the same for Vento: he was **[being emptied out from
the inside]{.underline}**---"gutted" was the word he used---**[until all
that was left was a big, raw gaping wound]{.underline}**. When her
husband died and she was flooded with grief, Joan Didion saw giant
waves. In her memoir, she writes that she felt as if she were being
battered by "destructive waves, paroxysms, sudden apprehensions that
weaken the knees and blind the eyes and obliterate the dailiness of
life" (Didion 2005, pp. 27--28). For Kay Redfield Jamison, a
psychiatrist who suffers from manic depression, the weapon is a giant
centrifuge, containing tubes of her blood. It spins around her mind
faster and faster, out of control, until it explodes, splattering blood
everywhere (Jamison 1996, p. 80). **[Listening to the language of pain
of all kinds, we discover a shared felt structure that the weapon
metaphor effectively captures]{.underline}** (Biro 2010, pp. 79--96).
**[Whether triggered by grief and depression or kidney stones and spinal
injury, pain reads like a story in three parts: Weapon]{.underline}**
\--\> \[**[to]{.underline}**\] **[Injury]{.underline}** \--\>
\[**[to]{.underline}**\] **[Withdrawal]{.underline}** **[In pain we feel
as if there must be some weapon-like object]{.underline}** (bomb, swarm
of parasites, giant wave, centrifuge) **[that is moving toward and
threatening us; that when it strikes, it will injure, possibly even
destroy us; and that we must get away from it or shield ourselves at all
costs. Even when there is nothing coming at us, when there is no injury,
when we remain motionless, we feel the movement, the injury and the
desire to run]{.underline}**. **[Whatever happens that makes us feel
these things---the loss of a loved one or the physical destruction of
cancer---we experience pain]{.underline}**. New Objective Evidence
**[The subjective evidence for the existence of emotional pain is
compelling, especially since there is no objective way to verify and
characterize someone else's pain]{.underline}**. Although we can attach
a person to a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) device,
observe the blood flow to pain centers in the brain and then infer its
presence, the only definitive test is a person's word: I feel pain or I
don't. Actually, most experts grudgingly acknowledge the inescapably
subjective nature of pain. In an addendum to their universally accepted
definition of pain---"An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience
associated with actual or potential tissue damage"---the International
Association for the Study of Pain (IASP 2007) concedes that people do
report pain for strictly psychological reasons and that, since such
reports can't be distinguished from instances where there is a physical
cause, they should be taken at face value: "If people regard their
experience as pain and if they report it in the same ways as pain caused
by tissue damage, it should be accepted as pain." But despite the
concession, the IASP does not make room for the pain experienced by Dan
Vento, Joan Didion, or Kay Redfield Jamison on their extensive
classification schemes of pain disorders. While complex regional
pain---which affects somewhere of the order of 6--26 people in 100,000
(de Mos et al. 2007)---appears on the list, the vastly more common pain
occurring in grief or depression does not. For physicians and scientists
that will only pay lip service to the subjective argument, however,
**[there is now mounting objective evidence for broadening our notion of
pain]{.underline}**. Since the introduction of gate control theory in
the 1960s, the link between tissue damage and pain has progressively
weakened. **[We now have a better understanding why there can be severe
injury and no pain]{.underline}** (wounded soldiers in battle)
**[and]{.underline}**, conversely, **[no injury and severe
pain]{.underline}** (migraine, fibromyalgia). **[This
happens]{.underline}**, as prominent pain scientists Ronald Melzack and
Patrick Wall have explained, **[because there are psychological
factors---one's culture and past experiences, our emotional and
cognitive states, the context of pain---that can intensify or dampen the
nociceptor signal before it registers in higher brain
centers]{.underline}** (Melzack and Wall 1983, pp. 15--33). Moreover,
many cases of chronic pain seem to occur without any direct nociceptor
stimulation at all. **[Neuropathic pain results when a dysfunctional
nervous system fires spontaneously or misinterprets ordinary sensory
stimuli as noxious]{.underline}** (Woolf and Mannion 1998). In tic
dolouroux, for example, the movement of a feather across the face can
trigger spasms of intense pain. A second strand of evidence comes from
our growing understanding of how the brain processes pain. It turns out
that pain is an incredibly complex perceptual system with multiple
subsystems. Most important for this discussion, there are distinct areas
in the brain that process the sensation of pain (its quality, location,
intensity) and our feelings about the sensation (the narrative of its
aversiveness) (Price 2000). Further, the sensory center (in the
somatosensory cortex) and the affective center (in the anterior
cingulate and insula cortices) are not only spatially apart but
dissociable: that is, a person can have the sensation of pain but not
feel pain (Grahek 2007, pp. 29--50). We can observe this in patients
undergoing minor surgery with medication that makes them indifferent to
being cut with a scalpel. Even more dramatic is a rare group of patients
whose affective pain centers (or the connections to those centers) have
been destroyed. In the case of pain asymbolia, patients can still sense
a needle prick (because the nociceptor signal registers in the
somatosensory cortex) but will laugh at its insignificance (because the
signal is not processed by the anterior cingulate cortex). These
instances of disconnect between the sensation and the feeling of pain
tell us that despite the complexity of pain---which involves sensations
and behavior, feeling, cognition and memory---the critical component is
feeling. If we don't have the feelings that Dan Vento had when the
kidney stone was passing through his ureter---that something bad was
happening to him, that that something was damaging his body, and that he
must do whatever he could to avoid further damage---then pain loses its
biological value. Because they laugh at pain rather than run from it,
pain asymbolia patients will likely fare no better than patients with
congenital or acquired pain insensitivity. In fact, I would argue that
if we don't feel pain, there's no point using the term at all. Leprosy
patients, soldiers on the battlefield, sedated patients undergoing
surgery, pain asymbolia patients---they may experience unpleasant
sensations but they don't feel pain and don't take protective measures.
Everything is contingent on the feeling of pain. If tissue damage is not
necessary to feeling pain and if there is a special affective center in
the brain devoted to such feeling, why can't that center be activated by
means other than the nociceptor pathway? **[Why isn't it possible that
noxious psychological stimuli]{.underline}**---stimuli **[that threaten
the emotional well-being of a person]{.underline}**, like the loss of a
child or the pain of depression or the suffering of cancer
patients---**[find their way to the anterior cingulate gyrus, making us
feel the same way we do when we experience physical pain?]{.underline}**
**[This is precisely what [scientists]{.mark} are
discovering]{.underline}**. Naomi **[Eisenberger and]{.underline}** her
**[colleagues at UCLA have]{.underline}** recently **[[developed
a]{.mark} clever [model]{.mark} of psychological pain [that can be
studied objectively]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Eisenberger et al. 2003).
**[Normal subjects played a video ball-tossing game while their brains
were monitored by fMRI. When the subjects were excluded from the virtual
game, they experienced distress that correlated with increased blood
flow to the anterior cingular and insular cortices, exactly the same
pattern that would have occurred had they been stuck by a needle. The
greater the social distress generated, the more active these affective
pain centers became. Studies done on saddened and grieving subjects
produced similar results]{.underline}** (Gundel et al. 2003). It appears
that **[the layperson's intuition about pain is being borne out by
science; [psychological pain seems to run on the same neural tracks as
physical pain]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And why shouldn't it? **[[Just as
physical stimuli that can damage our bodies prompt certain feelings and
responses, so too should psychological stimuli that can damage our
psyche like the loss of a child or]{.mark} the intrinsic symptoms of
[depression]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Just as we need to rest the body to
protect ourselves from further harm, so too should we protect the mind.
**[This more complete and comprehensive warning system certainly makes
sense from a biological perspective]{.underline}**. **[Why Words Matter
Does it matter whether we call]{.underline}** Dan Vento's **[feelings
pain or suffering? Is this just a semantic issue, a disagreement between
two sets of language users that, in the end, doesn't have any adverse
consequences? [Yes, it does matter, and yes, it has adverse
consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It matters because the disagreement
reflects a much larger issue: the rigid mindset of the scientific
community, which sees the world in a certain way and won't allow for
deviation, even from dissenters within its own ranks. Science focuses
its spotlight exclusively on the objective world, what can be studied,
quantified, and explained. Because it seems resistant to such inquiry,
the subjective realm has been traditionally off limits, something that
can only be appreciated on much looser terms by the humanities and the
"softer" sciences (e.g., psychology). **[[This mindset informs
values]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and not just the values of scientists.
Because of their position in the intellectual hierarchy, **[[there is a
trickle-down effect, which carries over to]{.mark} the practical science
of [medicine and]{.mark} to the [culture]{.mark} at
large]{.underline}**. In the case of pain, there is only one kind, the
real or physical kind that can be objectively verified by observing
nociceptor activity or finding lesions on a CAT scan. Other experiences
that may feel like pain but cannot be linked to tissue damage are not
pain. Much more subjective and less transparently material, they are
therefore derivative, less important, and better labeled something else
(suffering or anguish). While psychological pain may be unpleasant, the
fact remains that it is "in our heads," not our bodies. **[As we
continue to unfold the logic of the objectivist (and dualistic)
paradigm]{.underline}**---which has now thoroughly permeated our
cultural consciousness---**[those who suffer without any physical
corroboration to show for it inevitably begin to appear suspect. They
are either crazy]{.underline}** (mentally ill),
**[deceitful]{.underline}** (because there is no real pain) **[or
weak]{.underline}** (everything is painful to such people). They don't
need pain doctors or pain medication, but psychiatrists and priests.
Disregarding for a moment that that all pain is "in the head"---even Dan
Vento's kidney stone pain, which he localized to the right side of his
pelvis---**[[the truth is that psychological pain is often more intense
and dangerous than the "real thing."]{.mark} For]{.underline}** Dan
**[Vento, his bout with kidney stones, among the most painful of all
medical conditions, was nothing compared to the pain of
grief]{.underline}**. Similarly, Lucy Grealy tells us in her memoir,
Autobiography of a Face (1995), that she would much rather face the pain
of cancer and its treatments than the far worse pain of feeling deformed
and lonely (pp. 7, 170, 186). In fact, **[many such sufferers welcome,
even court, physical pain, feeling that it actually alleviates their
emotional pain to a degree]{.underline}**. And **[when, unalleviated,
the pain becomes too much to bear, some will choose to end it by ending
life. Suicide rates are significantly higher in the setting of grief and
depression than they are in the setting of physical pain]{.underline}**
(Schneidman 1998). **[In addition to [relegating psychological sufferers
to second-class status]{.mark}, the prevailing objectivist mindset [is
also detrimental to]{.mark}]{.underline}** another large group of
people. **[[Sufferers of chronic pain conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}**
like migraine, lower back pain, and fibromyalgia find themselves
somewhere in limbo between real pain and the derivative, mental kind. On
the one hand, their pain seems physical (because it is localized to a
part of the body), but on the other, it has more in more in common with
psychological distress (because there is no detectable injury). For a
long time, medicine had no idea what to do with these patients, and so
they drifted from doctor to doctor without finding relief. Although
their lives have improved with the introduction of pain specialists and
pain clinics, **[chronic pain [patients are]{.mark} still often
[tormented by the insidious logic of the objectivist
perspective]{.mark}]{.underline}** (see Heshusius 2009, pp. 1--19).
Some, in fact, resort to self-mutilation to legitimize their pain in the
face of ongoing skepticism from family members and doctors: "You see
now," they will say, pointing to their slashed arms, "The pain is not in
my head, it's real (see Padfield 2003, pp. 41--43). I bring up the
seriousness of psychological pain and the limbo-like situation of
chronic pain conditions because, like the work of a growing number of
scientists, it goes against the grain of the prevailing mindset.
Perhaps, then, **[[we should change this mindset]{.mark} and broaden our
outlook. [Instead of privileging one type of pain]{.mark} over another,
[let's approach them in a more inclusive, democratic spirit]{.mark}, in
which all pains are created equal. Or]{.underline}** better yet,
**[let's view pain as occurring on a continuum or spectrum that runs
from]{.underline}** one ideal (**[pain linked solely to physical
injury]{.underline}**) **[to]{.underline}** another (**[pain linked
solely to psychological injury]{.underline}**). **[A spectrum of pain
certainly matches our experience more accurately than the conventional
paradigm. It accommodates our belief that the feeling of pain can arise
from injury to the body as well as injury to the mind. It also
accommodates our experience of the considerable overlap between the two
varieties, that there is never pure physical or pure psychological pain
but always combinations. Those suffering from grief and mental illness
often have somatic complaints]{.underline}**: Dan Vento felt the loss of
his daughter in his gut; William Styron's descent into depression was
accompanied by sleeping and breathing problems (Styron 1992, pp. 18,
42--43). **[At the same time, patients in physical pain inevitably
suffer emotionally]{.underline}**; cancer patients routinely feel
terrified, helpless and lonely (Cherney et al. 1994). Moreover, **[the
[benefits]{.mark} of adopting a broader perspective [go beyond
validating and valuing our lived experiences. There are practical
implications]{.mark}. For science, [it would mean more support
for]{.mark} the [transformative]{.mark} work of
[research]{.mark}ers]{.underline}** like Joseph LeDoux and Antonio
Damasio **[[into]{.mark} the subjective realm of [feelings and
emotions]{.mark}]{.underline}** (LeDoux 1996; Damasio 1999). After all,
**[these experiences are as material as the beating of the heart and the
DNA molecule]{.underline}**, even though at the moment we don't
precisely know how to translate neural activity (brain language) into
mental states (mind language). **[So too is psychological
pain]{.underline}**. Now that we know it shares neurological substrates
with physical pain, scientists will no doubt look to extend the work of
Eisenberger by finding the "nociceptor pathways" of psychological
injury: How are feelings of grief or depression detected and transmitted
to the anterior cingular cortex? and How could the signals be modifed?
This new mindset might also lead to insight about pathological pain
states. Dan Vento's prolonged grief---what psychiatrists classify as
complicated grief---has much in common with certain chronic pain states.
In both instances, the injury has long past and yet the reverberating
pain circuit, no longer serving any biological purpose, continues. Are
there similar mechanisms at work here, and might they be manipulated to
help Vento escape from his self-destructive rut? **[[There would]{.mark}
also [be changes in the]{.mark} clinical realm, improving the [way
doctors treat pain]{.mark}. Some patients may require more attention to
the body; others, to the mind; the majority, to both]{.underline}**.
Here too there is room for innovative thinking. Take, for example, the
placebo effect in clinical trials, in which a fake pill has been shown
to relieve pain on the order of 15--30% of cases. Most investigators
view the phenomenon as a contaminant that must be eliminated to assess
the efficacy of the "real" drug. But why not switch frames, as Benedetti
(2009) has urged, and focus just as diligently on the reality of the
psychological factors that are equally effective, in some cases even
more so (pp. 6, 30)? Why not try to harness and enhance these factors to
help patients? This same novel way of thinking led DeWall et al. (2010)
to administer physical pain medication (acetaminophen) to people
suffering from psychological hurt, and not unsurprisingly, it seemed to
work. One of the greatest twentieth-century thinkers, Ludwig
Wittgenstein, showed that paying attention to ordinary language can help
advance philosophy. Perhaps the same holds true for science. He also
showed that clinging dogmatically to a certain picture can lead to
conceptual illness (Wittgenstein 1958, Sect. 115). **[[If we]{.mark} can
thoroughly [break with our]{.mark} unhealthy (and inaccurate) [dualistic
legacy]{.mark} and truly see that mind and body are inextricably
connected, then [we must agree]{.mark} with]{.underline}** Dan Vento,
Joan Didion, and many other **[sufferers [that psychological pain exists
and is just as important]{.mark} and worthy of our attention [as
physical pain]{.mark}. They are two sides of the same coin and should be
spoken of and treated as such]{.underline}**. Footnotes in this card: 1.
I am arguing here neither that psychic distress is any less real than
physical pain nor that somatic complaints can accompany psychiatric
illness---in fact, 50% of depressed patients report symptoms of physical
pain (Katona et al. 2005)---but that psychic distress can itself be
painful in a meaningful sense, that it can be phenomenologically akin to
physical pain and, therefore, should be categorized under the same
rubric.

#### [In this context]{.underline}, "extinction first!" justifies racism and dismisses the pain of hundreds of thousands of people. It's also [self-defeating]{.underline} because the intergenerational accumulation of toxic stress from psychological pain [is itself]{.underline} an existential risk.

of toxic stress and trauma. **[[Traumatic Stress]{.mark} and PTSD [is
most destructive when passed down]{.mark} from person to person, and

depression, rage, and substance abuse. So often trauma expresses itself
as chronic and severe pain, and billions of dollars are spent on
irrelevant treatments, causing an excess of unnecessary suffering. "The
most common complaint in current medical practice -- that of persistent
and unexplained chronic pain -- has its roots in the changes in Brain
Circuitry associated with unresolved traumatization. Perpetuation of
pain is a dysfunctional survival tool." -Robert Scaer, MDKa The Heal
Trauma Save The World Project™ is about the healing of humankind's
deepest of all wounds: trauma, and its residual by product: Traumatic
Stress. Trauma can not only be caused by major accidents, botched
medical care, war, or other catastrophic events, but also from physical
and emotional abuse, neglect, lack of touch, and many other more subtle
forms. **[Unresolved trauma creates Post Traumatic Stress, which
disturbs our biology. Disturbed biology expresses itself in myriad and
diverse forms of disease and suffering of both mind and]{.underline}**
body. One of life's greatest mysteries is how unresolved trauma deeply
affects our lives and health, because it is so often a totally
unconscious process. It is important to realize that most of the
physical and \[end page 1\] psychological effects of trauma that people
experience are the result of non-integrated previous traumatic exposure.
"Common occurrences can produce traumatic after-effects that are just as
debilitating as those experienced by veterans of combat or survivors of
childhood abuse Traumatic effects are not always apparent immediately
following the incidents that caused them. Symptoms remain dormant,
accumulating over years or even decades. Then, during a stressful
period, or as the result of another incident, they can show up without
warning. There may also be no indication of the original cause. Thus, a
seemingly minor event can give rise to a sudden breakdown, similar to
one that might be caused by a single catastrophic event." -Peter Levine,
PhD **[Post Traumatic Stress has the power to create or mimic almost any
kind of symptom and disease including the most severe neurological and
psychological disorders. This process is deeply unconscious because of
the loss of brain body connection due to dissociation. Dissociation is
one of the most insidious of all human conditions]{.underline}**.
"Dissociative disorders are usually triggered (precipitated) by
overwhelming stress. The stress may be caused by experiencing or
witnessing a traumatic event, accident, or disaster. Or a person may
experience inner conflict so intolerable that his mind is forced to
separate incompatible or unacceptable information and feelings from
conscious thought." -Merck Manual Home Edition "Evolution of the concept
of dissociation led to the description of a constellation of varied
clinical manifestations attributed to it, including altered perceptions
of physical sensation, time, memory, and the perceptions of self and
reality." -Robert Scaer, MD \[end page 2\]
**[Dissociation]{.underline}** and in particular somatic dissociation,
**[is the loss of body-based sensory information]{.underline}**, **[and
the inability to proactively interface with symptoms or sensations.
Dissociation can be the result of a barrage of painful and stressful
stimuli to the nervous system without corresponding release and
integration. When humans are subjected to these [painful stimuli]{.mark}
they [activate evolutionary protection and survival mechanisms]{.mark}.
These biological mechanisms shut down self-awareness in an effort to
numb oneself to the pain. With the loss of this innate biological
self-awareness, we lose the ability to advance brain body feedback and
therefore are unable to detect early disease states and proactively
create change. Dissociation can rob us our very sense of joy and
purpose]{.underline}**. The true cause of all this suffering is seldom
addressed: that is non-dissipated, nonintegrated, traumatic energy.
**[[Frozen traumatic energy arrests higher stages of]{.mark} human

But in reality, of course, the two procedures coexist. **[The US
government agencies running the \"war on terror\" have become
increasingly reliant on an extralegal practice known as \"extraordinary
rendition\"\--a euphemism for a policy of seizing suspicious individuals
at home or abroad without even the semblance of due process and sending
them off to be interrogated by allied regimes known to practice
torture]{.underline}**. Not all of the \"enhanced\" interrogations are
farmed out to foreign intelligence services, however: Witness the CIA\'s
\"black sites,\" located abroad but covertly operated by the US
government. Presumably, \"high-value\" detainees are whisked away to
these undisclosed locations when no foreign proxy can be entrusted to do
the job right. So what about the \"realistic\" counterargument to this
policy of clandestine torture? **[The war on terror is dirty, the
realists begin by admitting]{.underline}**. At times the lives of
thousands depend on information we may be able to extract from our
prisoners. So what do you think the government is going to do? And if
we\'re going to do it\--with great reluctance, of course\--then
shouldn\'t we have checks on the way we do it, to prevent excesses? As
Alan Dershowitz put it, \"I\'m not in favor of torture, but if you\'re
going to have it, it should damn well have court approval.\" This logic
is, of course, extremely dangerous: It legitimizes torture and thus
opens up the space for more illicit torture. So we must reject the
liberal \"honesty\" of a Dershowitz, but are we **[now stuck supporting
a paradoxical and hypocritical policy of publicly condemning torture
while privately practicing it]{.underline}**? In a singular situation,
confronted with the proverbial \"prisoner who knows\" and whose words
might save thousands, one would unquestionably turn to torture as a last
resort; however, it is absolutely crucial that one not elevate this
desperate choice into a universal principle. Rather, in the unavoidable,
brutal urgency of the moment, one should simply do it. **[Only by
rejecting in principle the notion that torture is permissible even in
dire circumstances]{.underline}** (while knowing that we resorted to it
in precisely such circumstances**[) can we retain the requisite sense of
guilt and awareness of the inadmissibility]{.underline}** of what we
did.

[Modern security regimes are defined by extremes]{.underline}. Practices
of [spying, torture, indefinite detention, and preemptive
war]{.underline} represent [favored responses by the United States to
the threats of insecurity introduced by terrorism]{.underline}. But
insecurity as a unifying concept has expanded virally since September
11, spreading into domains of public health and disaster management,
among others. Interestingly, whether for the mitigation of potential
terrorist threats, avian flu pandemics, or hurricanes, executive
privilege and individual responsibility prevail as dominant framing
mechanisms for necessary response. In addition, [responses to insecurity
are increasingly technologized and militarized, whether in the form of
technological surveillance, command-and-control organizational
structures, or pervasive cultures of secrecy]{.underline}. These are not
simply discrete actions played out on the level of nation-state policy.
Instead, [the field for social practice and conceptions of appropriate
governance are transforming rapidly in this climate of absolute
threats]{.underline}. [It is appropriate and necessary, therefore, to
assess the implications of security regimes upon public institutions,
modes of governance, and forms of life.]{.underline} This article begins
this project by analyzing the discourses surrounding torture and
disaster preparedness in the United States.

insecurity, while the militarization of government agencies, costly
wars, and privatized security forces deplete resources]{.underline}
sorely needed for public programs. All the while, [moral panics about

cultivated]{.underline} by and answered with disaster preparedness

terrified, but bravely embraces responsibility for contending with all
known and unknown threats, leaving the government to deal with national
security matters elsewhere]{.underline}, as it sees fit. The resulting
[macro-power structure]{.underline} can be seen as one [of "fragmented
centralization"]{.underline} (Monahan, 2005), meaning [that
decision-making is highly centralized]{.underline} (and secretive in
this instance), while [the burden of those decisions falls]{.underline}
squarely [upon the most vulnerable populations in society, populations

This essay examines the [public discourse of torture]{.underline},
particularly in the early debate, and uses aspects of Elmaghraby's
ordeal to draw attention to three key arguments. It first considers an
archetypal representation of torture circulating widely in speculative
news and legal argument since 9/11. In arguments both for and against
the use of torture, **[the unquestioned status and prevalence of an
archetypal encounter between interrogator and subject have made it
iconic, defining and limiting our understanding of torture, terrorist,
and terror through its very repetition]{.underline}**. It has helped
promote a misrecognition of torture, past and present. For instance,
Elmaghraby's torture, though it meets the UN definition, falls outside
the circle defined by this archetypal instance. This iconic depiction is
also far afield from, say, [torture events at Abu Ghraib
prison]{.underline} in Iraq or the circumstances alleged in the cases of
the forty-five men suspected or confirmed to have been [murdered in U.S.
military custody]{.underline}, yet it has been and continues to be
mobilized routinely in news writing. 7 Ultimately, the archetype
functions, even in nuanced rejections of torture, to narrow our
understanding of the systemic and communal nature of torture and to
disconnect torture from its history of use in the United States: [the
use of torture in lynching and internal racial repression; its use in
U.S. colonial wars and counterinsurgency programs in Cold War client
states; and its use in policing contexts and prisons. These three lines
of American descent are visible in the torture methods at issue in the
war on terror today.]{.underline}

Elaine Scarry's The Body in Pain drew on the full complexity of
Amnesty's documentation from the 1970s, not just the rhetoric of the
opening appeal. A fascinating and careful argument based on Amnesty
reports as well as literary and philosophical sources, Scarry's profound
contribution exposes ["interrogation" as an alibi that plays an integral
role in the theatrical pantomime of torture]{.underline}. And yet, for
Scarry, "the basic structure of torture" is the iconic scenario I have
described; her analysis [keeps torture structurally bound to the charade
of interrogation and the archetypal depiction. Torture is "essentially a
two-person event . . . premised on one-directional
injuring."]{.underline} 17 To better delineate its features, she lifts
the players out of historical and cultural space and time: "[Torture has
a structure that is as narrow and consistent as its geographical
incidence is widespread.]{.underline}" She further explains, "That
structure entails the simultaneous and inseparable occurrence of three
events . . . first, [the infliction of physical pain]{.underline};
second, [the objectification of the eight central attributes of
pain]{.underline}; and third[, the translation of those attributes into
the insignia of the regime]{.underline}." 18 For Scarry[, the
"one-directional injuring" of torture relies upon the symbolic rituals
of interrogation, but torture is not about eliciting speech and
information]{.underline}. Instead[, it uses speech to reduce the
subject's voice either to silence or to an echo of the
interrogator's]{.underline}. In [eliminating the subject's ability to
speak for himself or herself, torture destroys language, self, and the
social world all at once. The pretense to interrogation is part of the
ritual violence.]{.underline}

#### Attempts to torture are to gain information to feel safer, the state uses this -- not to prevent terror attacks but to control the sphere of information, only through establishing a new discourse surrounding a decentering of current epistemology can prevent this -- the debate space, especially your ballot is key

**Rensch \'16** (Adam Theron-Lee Rensch, 7-8-2016, \"The appeal of
torture: what I learned from teaching a class on terrorism\", Guardian,
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/08/torture-terrorism-college-class>)
\[HS\]

[How]{.underline}, I wondered, [could they be so accepting of torture?
The predicament]{.underline} almost exclusively [used in discussions of
torture is the so-called "ticking bomb" scenario: an evil terrorist is
withholding critical information about an imminent attack, and in order
to save thousands of lives, he must be tortured to elicit the
details]{.underline}. On its face, [this scenario seems difficult to
refute. It is almost common sense to agree that such an attack should be
prevented at all costs, and the rights of one immoral person are worth
considerably less than the lives of thousands of innocents]{.underline}.
[Such utilitarian logic is troubling. Leaving aside]{.underline} [the
remarkable implausibility of such a scenario ever taking place, it
reduces human life to a vague notion of "worth" without sufficiently
offering up a picture of how such value is established. It is an
abstract way of thinking about life that often favors quantity over
quality and ignores the particular experiences of different lives. By
this logic, one American life, even an innocent one, should be worth
less than hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqis. As we have seen
countless times in the past few decades, this is simply not the case.
When I presented this]{.underline} argument [to my
students]{.underline}, [many seemed to agree]{.underline}. Nevertheless,
they couldn't really see why torture should never be used. [Why did it
need to be forbidden]{.underline} so absolutely, especially
[considering]{.underline} those [clearcut examples when critical
information is needed to save lives? Shouldn't we do everything we can
to save lives]{.underline}? At the time, I didn't know how to respond
this question. Quite honestly, I had made the error of assuming what my
students would think ahead of time, and as a result wasn't prepared. I
couldn't give them a simple answer, and it bothered me that I couldn't
give them a simple answer. I just wrung my hands and shook my head and
sort of laughed in disbelief. Looking back, it seems to me that this
inability to answer, my not knowing how to respond, is precisely the
point. [The logic of every justification of torture is that it offers a
foolproof solution to an impossible problem: lack of
knowledge.]{.underline} What I should have said to my students was that
scenarios justifying torture never question whether the person being
tortured actually has information, nor how the torturer knows this
person has information. [The scenarios simply accept it as fact that the
person has "something" important. If you reframe the scenario and say
"we don't know if this person has information, but we're going to
torture him on the off chance he does", things begin to look a little
different]{.underline}. When listening to someone such as Trump casually
endorse torture, it becomes clear why people are so receptive to it. It
promises a solution to the terrifying reality that we simply can't
predict, with 100% certainty, when the next attack will be. My point is
not that we need an argument against torture. We shouldn't have to argue
against torture[. My point is that torture, even in the most implausible
of scenarios, isn't actually the solution to the problem, but rather
something that obscures the problem by presenting itself as a
solution]{.underline}. [What's really bothering us isn't that another
attack is possible, but rather that we often can't "have all the facts"
and prevent this attack. As a teacher, students expect you to have
answers to their questions]{.underline}. [Students look to you for
guidance and authority]{.underline}. My own students were bright and
insightful, but they also didn't feel as if they had enough authority to
speak about big issues with any degree of certainty. Their default
position, in these instances, was to shut down and not engage. One of
the things I always stressed is that it's OK to not know. It allows you
to ask questions you might not otherwise ask, and perhaps arrive at a
more thoughtful conclusion. [The problem is that in the Information
Age]{.underline}, and the conquering of the world by Google, [such a
position of uncertainty is less accepted. We've been trained to demand,
and expect, immediate answers]{.underline}. This is fine if you need to
convert feet to meters, or translate a Latin phrase to any language of
your choosing. [But what about those things that don't have easy
answers, the things we fear, the things that affect and shape our
lives?]{.underline}

The fate of Terri Schiavo and **[the fate of the tortured prisoners are
the]{.underline}** two **[extremes of America\'s regard for human
rights:]{.underline}** on the one hand \"those missed by the bombs\"
(mentally and physically complete human beings who must be deprived of
all rights), on the other hand a human being reduced to bare vegetative
life (the living dead whose \"life\" must be protected by the entire
state apparatus). What these two opposites share is **[a reduction to
bare lif]{.underline}**e. In the Schiavo case, this reduction is a
biological reality, which is why her life deserves protection; **[in the
case of tortured prisoners, this reduction is imposed by the state
apparatus, which is why their lives are deemed unworthy of
protection.]{.underline}** Terri Schiavo not only deserved to enjoy
every human right but must have them forced on her, though she was
unable in any event to make use of them as a person; the tortured
prisoners are able to use\--and presumably desperate to be granted\--any
human right but must be deprived of all. **[The legitimization of
torture and the excessive care for a human life reduced to vegetative
state are thus two manifestations of the same grotesque
logic.]{.underline}** There is, however, a further phantasmic element
that sustains the tolerance for torture\--that of being exposed to a
potential or invisible threat: **[It is the invisible (and for that very
reason all-powerful and omnipresent) threat of the Enemy that
legitimizes the permanent state of emergency of the Established
Power.]{.underline}** (Fascists invoked the threat of the Jewish
conspiracy, Stalinists the threat of the class enemy, and today, of
course, we have the \"war on terror.\") **[This invisible threat of the
Enemy legitimizes the logic of the preemptive strike. Precisely because
the threat is virtual, one can\'t wait for its actualization, the
omnipresent invisible threat of \"terror\" legitimizes the all too
visible protective measures of defense]{.underline}** (which, of course,
pose the only true threat to democracy and human rights). If the classic
exercise of power lay in the threat made operative precisely by way of
never actualizing itself, by way of remaining a threatening gesture (a
stratagem that reached its climax in the cold war, wherein the threat of
the mutual nuclear destruction had to remain a threat), with the war on
terror, the invisible threat causes the incessant actualization not of
itself but of the measures against itself**[. The nuclear strike had to
remain the threat of a strike, while the threat of the terrorist strike
triggers an endless series of strikes against alleged and even merely
potential terrorists.]{.underline}** The power that presents itself as
being always under threat, living in mortal danger, and thus merely
defending itself is the most dangerous kind of power, the very model of
Nietzschean ressentiment and moralistic hypocrisy\--and was it not
Nietzsche himself who, more than a century ago, provided avant la lettre
the best analysis of the false moral premises of today\'s \"war on
terror\"? No government admits any more that it keeps an army to satisfy
occasionally the desire for conquest. Rather **[the army is supposed to
serve for defense, and one invokes the morality that approves of
self-defense. But this implies one\'s own morality and the neighbor\'s
immorality; for the neighbor must be thought of as eager to attack and
conquer if our state must think of means of self-defense.]{.underline}**
Moreover, the reasons we give for requiring an army imply that our
neighbor, who denies the desire for conquest just as much as does our
own state, and who, for his part, also keeps an army only for reasons of
self-defense, is a hypocrite and a cunning criminal who would like
nothing better than to overpower a harmless and awkward victim without
any fight. Thus all states are now ranged against each other: they
presuppose their neighbor\'s bad disposition and their own good
disposition. This presupposition, however, is inhumane, as bad as war
and worse. At bottom, indeed, **[it is itself the challenge and the
cause of wars, because, as I have said, it attributes immorality to the
neighbor and thus provokes a hostile disposition and act. We must abjure
the doctrine of the army as a means of self-defense just as completely
as the desire for conquests.]{.underline}**

\*trigger warning\*

Several of the United States presidential candidates have made
statements endorsing the use of so-called "enhanced interrogation
techniques," and yesterday, Donald Trump put his support in writing.
[There are many things troubling about endorsing practices that amount
to torture]{.underline} -- [the rousing applause candidates get when
voicing support for them is just one]{.underline}. More troubling is how
comfortable the candidates seem embracing inhumane acts like forcing
detainees into painful positions for days with no sleep, pouring water
through their nose and mouth until they nearly asphyxiate, and chaining
them to a wall or ceiling in their cell. Republican U.S. presidential
candidates (L-R) Governor John Kasich, former Governor Jeb Bush, U.S.
Senator Ted Cruz, businessman Donald Trump, Senator Marco Rubio and Dr.
Ben Carson arrive onstage before the start of the Republican U.S.
presidential candiEXPAND Some blame for this situation rests with the
Obama administration. Though President Barack Obama ended the CIA's
"enhanced interrogation program," his administration has refused to
prosecute anyone responsible for authorizing, implementing, or carrying
out the program -- or even going beyond what was authorized. Current and
former CIA officials shoulder some of the blame as well for refusing to
repudiate the practices and taking every opportunity to defend them.
Though Obama's current CIA Director John Brennan admitted mistakes were
made, the agency's response to the Senate Intelligence Committee's
scathing study of the CIA program attempted to refute its main finding
-- that use of "enhanced interrogation techniques" was not an effective
means of gathering useful intelligence. [Trump may have had the CIA's
response in mind when he wrote in his recent op-ed that, "Depending on
the source, these techniques allowed officials to glean significant
information about operations hostile to the United States."]{.underline}
Though the Senate study did an excellent job refuting claims the CIA had
been publicly making for years -- that "enhanced interrogation
techniques" were effective -- the study's focus on whether the program
"worked" continues to dominate today's debate about torture.
Overwhelmingly, [experts agree torture does not work, that it produces
unreliable information, and that it undermines attempts to get detainees
to cooperate]{.underline}. But that's not why torture should not be
used. [It should not be used because it is cruel and inhumane to abuse
someone in a government's custody and control]{.underline}. That is also
why it is illegal. [Trump's argument]{.underline} that "we are too
politically correct to respond in kind" to the brutal tactics of the
Islamic State [misses the point]{.underline}. It's not about responding
in kind -- it's about responding in a way that respects inherent human
dignity, including of one's enemies. The [use of torture has done
enormous damage to the US reputation, destroyed the lives of detainees,
and undermined the ability of the US to advocate against abusive
detention practices and other rights violations around the
world]{.underline}. Though US law bans torture, until the US makes clear
that it used illegal interrogation methods and CIA officials stop
defending the practices, [candidates will continue to play the torture
card for political advantage]{.underline}. And that will leave the
public wondering whether "enhanced interrogation techniques" maybe
should be used again.

#### There is a double standard regarding the discourse of torture which pathologizes the developing nations and otherizes them as savage while western nations benefit

When reading [articles regarding U.S torture]{.underline}, you are
almost guaranteed to find adjectives such as "brutal," "harsh," and
"extreme" used to describe the torture by the CIA at Guantanamo
(Mirkinson, 2014). Of course, we can't forget the "enhanced
interrogation" phrase that many also like to throw around. Though the
findings of the CIA Senate Torture Report concludes that the actions at
Guantanamo were indeed torture[, it continues to be difficult to find a
news outlet that will use the]{.underline} forbidden ["t"
word]{.underline}. With the release of the senate report there was
naturally an influx of articles and news reports on Guantanamo. Jack
Mirkinson of the Huffington Post explains that though the information is
newly released, what isn't new is "the media's persistent dance around
the word at the heart of the entire story: 'torture'" (Mirkinson, 2014).
He references one study, which found that [when the Bush administration
began using waterboarding as an interrogation method, many major media
outlets stopped defining the practice as torture]{.underline}
(Mirkinson, 2014). Mirkinson provides examples of some of the country's
largest news outlets, including MSNBC, The New York Times, and The
Washington Post, all of which avoided using the word torture (Mirkinson,
2014). Where the word torture is most commonly found is in alternative
news outlets such as Truthout, a nonprofit organization "dedicated to
providing independent news and commentary on a daily basis" (Ahmed,
2014). In an article titled, The United States Is Committing Brutal Acts
of Torture Right Now, Truthout writer Nafeez Ahmed writes, "**[Media
coverage of the Senate report has largely whitewashed the extent to
which torture has always been an integral and systematic intelligence
practice since the Second World War]{.underline}**..." (Ahmed, 2014).
AlternativeNews, The Real News Network, and AlterNet are all additional
independent news outlets that not only use the word torture but also
explicitly call out mainstream media for failing to do so. [The problem
remains though, that a large portion,]{.underline} I would suspect the
majority, [of Americans rely on mainstream news outlets for their
information. **The Double Standard** The rhetoric used by the U.S
mainstream media in regards to foreign torture,]{.underline} on the
other hand, [is almost astonishing]{.underline}. One New York Time's
headline reads, Organizations Say Torture Is Widespread in Libya Jails
(Stack, 2012). A Washington Post article claims, China must be pressed
to end torture by police (Wang, 2015). The list can continue for pages,
with [no hesitation from U.S news outlets to use the word torture when
referring to other countries.]{.underline} What is particularly
interesting is the lack of consistency in U.S reporting. A study from
the Joan Shorenstein Center at Harvard reveals a significant shift in
the way that U.S news outlets have covered torture. From the 1930's
until 2004, newspapers that reported on waterboarding almost always
considered it torture; "The New York Times characterized it thus in
81.5% of articles on the subject and The Los Angeles Times did so in
96.3% of articles" (Linkins, 2010). Following 2002 (around the time when
the Bush administration began implementing waterboarding), those same
newspapers rarely referred to waterboarding as torture; "The New York
Times called waterboarding torture or implied it was torture in just
1.4% of articles. The Los Angeles Times did so in 4.8% of articles. The
Wall Street Journal characterized the practice as torture in just 1.6%
of articles. USA Today never called waterboarding torture or implied it
was torture" (Linkins, 2010). [When it comes to other countries' use of
waterboarding, the study showed no reluctance to use the "t"
word]{.underline}: In The New York Times, [85.8% of articles that dealt
with a country other than the United States using waterboarding called
it torture or implied it was torture while only 7.69% did so when the
United States was responsible]{.underline}. [The Los Angeles Times
characterized the practice as torture in 91.3% of articles when another
country was the violator, but in only 11.4% of articles when the United
States was the perpetrator]{.underline} (Linkins, 2010). Development and
Torture Spain and New Zealand join the United States in the group of
developed countries that use torture (Gallagher, 2014 & Brooking, 2014).
Additionally, the Human Rights Watch has accused France, Germany and the
United Kingdom of using intelligence that was gathered by using torture
("No Questions," 2010). There are, of course, numerous other developed
countries that use torture but receive minimal attention (Noack, 2014).
Why then, is there little mainstream media coverage of these developed,
particularly Western, countries? It seems that [Western]{.underline},
especially American, [news outlets are the groups afraid to call Western
torture what it truly is]{.underline}. CJ Werlemen, a writer for the
Middle East Eye, has no hesitation in calling out the U.S, writing,
"**[Americans are pro-torture and proud of it]{.underline}**" (Werleman,
2016). An article in the Iran Daily is titled, Guantanamo prisoner
recounts ordeal, tortured by guards ("Guantanamo prisoner," 2016). To my
surprise, alongside Saudi Arabia, The United Arab Emirates, Cuba,
Burundi, China, Vietnam, Syria, Eritrea, and Iran, the United Nations
Human Rights Council recently called out the U.S and U.K for torture
("United Nations," 2016). Other organizations and media outlets, though,
place a much larger emphasis on developing, non-Western countries that
torture. One article by The Guardian is titled, Afghanistan officials
sanctioned murder, torture and rape, says report (Graham-Harrison,
2015). Even Amnesty International uses different rhetoric when
discussing U.S torture versus discussing other countries that torture.
Their headline for U.S torture reads, for example, U.S Needs
Accountability for Torture ("Demand Accountability"). Their Mexico
torture campaign, on the other hand, reads, Torture in Mexico is Out of
Control, followed by horrific descriptions of Mexican torture ("Police
and soldiers"). "Out of Control" is quite a powerful phrase and creates
a very specific picture of Mexican torture. Amnesty's current torture
campaign states that their "priority countries" are Mexico, the
Philippines, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan, coincidentally all non-Western
countries ("Global Campaign"). [The studies, headlines, and articles
show a clear focus on torture in developing, non-Western
countries]{.underline}. [Though torture occurs in countless developed
nations, there is a lack of demand for developed, Western countries'
accountability]{.underline}. [The rhetoric surrounding torture in
developing, non-Western countries convey barbarism and ruthlessness
while weaker words such as "brutal," "enhanced," or "harsh" are used to
describe Western torture. This language choice is powerful, influencing
perceptions and ultimately categorization]{.underline}. **[Though the
same actions may be occurring in two different countries, the way in
which each is portrayed impacts the public's tolerance for those
actions]{.underline}**. [Hearing that the U.S is using enhanced
interrogation]{.underline}, for example, is [much different than hearing
that torture in Mexico is out of control]{.underline}. This discrepancy
determines which countries get demonized and which countries are left to
perpetrate torture behind closed doors. Hearing "out of control" conveys
urgency, but isn't the CIA's torture at Guantanamo also "out of
control?" [When the media, activist organizations, and news sources stop
considering an action to be torture, is that action no longer
torture?]{.underline} Why does media portrayal appear to supersede
international law? Perhaps most importantly, **[why are developing,
non-Western countries portrayed as savage, while developing countries
are also committing horrific acts?]{.underline}**

Against such **[a background of 'epistemological obstacles' (Bachelard
1938/ 2002) to the study of the West, our primary objective in this
article is to reconstruct and theorise transformations of Western order
in a manner that does not presuppose a fixed understanding of 'the West'
as a pre-constituted political space, ready-made and waiting for social
scientific inquiry]{.underline}**. 'The West', we contend, is one of the
elusive phenomena in international politics, which do not have phone
numbers --- to recall one of Henry Kissinger's complaints Journal of
International Relations and Development Volume 17, Number 3, 2014 368
about an ineffectual European partner at the side of the United States
(US). Yet, references to 'the West' are ubiquitous in both political and
scholarly discourse, each of them conveying some notion of what the West
stands for. **[Motivated by a reconstructive interest, we propose
focusing on the performative effects of these references. We are
specifically interested in the institutional consequences of a security
semantics in which 'the West' figures as the threatened, yet notoriously
vague referent object that has to be defended against alleged
challenges. A political formation or order called 'the West' can then be
understood as a contingent arrangement of such institutional
consequences, an arrangement that is continuously constituted,
reproduced and transformed, for instance, by speech acts of
securitisation.]{.underline}** Hence, to the extent that securitisation
has become a more important mechanism in reproducing the West in recent
years, one might say that 'the West' is indeed secured by securitising
its very existence. Given that the standard image of a Western community
of values is linked prominently with the notion of security communities,
the article will begin with a critical review of this literature. In the
section 'A Western security community?', we argue that the Copenhagen
School's understanding of **[securitisation dynamics provides an
adequate methodological framework for reconstructing the reproductive
and transformative dynamics at hand. In the section 'A securitising
community -- theorising 'the West'', we reconstruct such securitisation
dynamics in three different fields: the implications of representing
China and Russia as main challengers of Western order, the effects of
the transformation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)
towards a global security actor, and the consequences of extraordinary
renditions and practices of torture for the normative infrastructure of
'the West'.]{.underline}** In the conclusion, we briefly outline why
Western securitisation dynamics in our view should be understood as a
discursive **[shift away from a legally enshrined culture of restraint
towards more assertive forms of self-authorisation.]{.underline}**

**[The Western 'War on Terror': Torture and extraordinary rendition At
first sight, NATO's self-authorising tendencies and Western claims to
universality might stand in sharp contrast to how 'the West' is commonly
perceived in its more favourable readings.]{.underline}** Among the
broad array of Western self-descriptions, allegiance to the rule of law
stands out as a bedrock principle. The difference between the 'West and
the rest' (Hall 1992) can be accounted for in many different ways, yet
the normative quality of a distinctive set of legal-- political routines
stands out as the one most commonly in use. Considerations of due
process and the legal writ of habeas corpus are more than derivative
characteristics, they --- rather than military strength or an advanced
form of capitalist organisation9 --- are held to define Western
societies and states as such. **[Unlawful detention, extraordinary
rendition, and torture would thus seem to constitute an obvious and
flagrant violation of the normative infrastructure of 'the West'.
Moreover, yet all of this did take place in the wake of 'Western'
responses to the atrocities of 9/11 that are now by convention referred
to as the global 'war on terrorism'.]{.underline}**10 To the extent that
such transgressions were justified in a language of necessity, **[we
seem to encounter a showcase example of securitisation.]{.underline}**
Both the symbolic value of targeting the Pentagon and the World Trade
Center, and the subsequent narratives of justification issued by
Al-Qaeda, signify **[that this was not an attack directed against the US
as a state, but more broadly an attack on 'the West' at large. Defending
'the West' and its unique form of life then might even justify
torture]{.underline}** --- **[and paradoxically the defence of the
'West' thus invoked becomes in itself a threat to 'the West' in its own
right, undermining the very principles it set out to
protect.11]{.underline}** Hence, **[the]{.underline}** interesting
research **[question here is not whether torture and extraordinary
rendition constitute instances of securitisation --- they obviously
do.]{.underline}** **[The challenge is rather to reconstruct carefully
the ways in which such securitisation dynamics play out, what
institutional consequences they yield, what patterns of justification
they involve, and how they contribute to transforming the normative
infrastructure of 'the West']{.underline}**. What is at stake, then, is
**[a reconstruction of the legal--political ramifications of torture and
extraordinary rendition, not the question of whether transgressions have
taken place and whether this conforms to antecedent expectations of
securitisation theory]{.underline}**. We know that **[democracies do
torture.]{.underline}** As Darius Rejali (2007) has shown in great
detail, **[democracies have not abolished torture but rather made it
invisible by inventing 'stealth techniques', which leave no
trace.]{.underline}** Interrogation techniques such as waterboarding are
thus, in an irritating way, specifically democratic forms of torture.
They respond to the legal and public constraints imposed on such
practices by **[norms against torture by removing them from the public
eye.]{.underline}** In fact, this pattern holds for all of the
'techniques' discussed in the notorious torture memos12 --- dietary
manipulation, nudity, the attention grasp, walling, the facial hold, the
facial slap or insult slap, cramped confinement, wall stranding, stress
position, water dousing, sleep deprivation of more than 48 hours, and
the waterboard. The very term applied to such measures, 'enhanced
interrogation techniques', testifies to a specific trait of what Rejali
calls 'clean torture'. None of them leaves a visible mark, none of them
seems as outrageously brutal as medieval forms of torture, and thus they
provide a comfortable degree of deniability to those in authority.
Hence, it is all the more important to **[focus on how specific
'techniques' have been administered and how this has been
justified.]{.underline}** 'In the study of torture', Rejali (2007: 63)
rightly observes, 'hell is in the details'. One of the detailed
questions raised in the torture memos concerns the 'Combined Use of
Certain Techniques'. Having stipulated that each of the single
'techniques' listed above does not constitute a violation of the
anti-torture statute, the 'Memorandum for John A. Rizzo, Senior Deputy
General Counsel, Central Intelligence Agency. Re: Application of 18
U.S.C. }} 2340-2340A to the Combined Use of Certain Techniques in the
Interrogation of High Value Al-Qaeda Detainees' discusses the question
of how things may change when several of these techniques are used in
combination. If sleep deprivation of more than 48 hours is not
considered to be legally problematic, then how about sleep deprivation
in combination with cramped confinement, dietary manipulation, and
repeated insult slaps? The way in which the question is posed in the
torture memos presupposes that this is all about navigating a legal grey
zone, where an imaginary torture threshold must not be crossed in order
to avoid legal repercussions. Within the rationality of the torture
memos it is very possible that any particular combination of techniques
does not constitute torture in a legal sense. It is also very possible
that any particular combination of techniques does constitute torture in
a legal sense. It all becomes a question of dosage. Here the memos are
being unspecific in a very specific way. What we can observe is an
instance of **[intra-institutional buck-passing, which exempts both the
US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Department of Justice from
being charged with explicitly advocating or conducting
torture.]{.underline}** From the point of view of the CIA, they just did
what was explicitly authorised by the Department of Justice; from the
point of view of the Department of Justice, ultimately crossing the
torture threshold would have to take place in specific instances of
interrogation and thus under the auspices of the CIA. A middle ground is
achieved when the memo calls for 'trained interrogators'. 'Trained
interrogators' are individuals capable of understanding what precise
dosage and combination of such 'techniques' can be administered in order
to remain on the safe side of legality. Hence, from the point of view of
both the CIA and the Department of Justice, transgressions can be
attributed to a situative misjudgement on the side of the trained
interrogator. The buck finally stops amidst a newly inaugurated class of
torture professionals, which specialises in remaining invisible to any
form of public and legal scrutiny. Such a logic of self-immunisation
repeats itself at the transatlantic level. We know that CIA flights
transported suspects to foreign detention camps, that they used European
airports and European infrastructure, and that apparently some of those
camps were located in Eastern member states of the EU. As a matter of
fact, and contrary to a public self-image that Europeans occasionally
tend to cast, Europe has been integral in practices of torture and
extraordinary rendition in the wake of the global war on terror. The
relevant information is contained in a report by Dick Marty, a Swiss
representative to the Council of Europe, on 'Alleged Secret Detentions
and Unlawful Inter-state Transfers Involving Council of Europe Member
States'. Yet, while stirring up a great deal of public interest, the
report was ultimately of little consequence. It fell victim to the
problem it described. In the wake of an effective buck-passing of
political responsibility, all it could do was diligently compile
information that had already been available in the news media. **[The
major finding of the report --- that there were indeed secret detentions
and extraordinary renditions, yet no one was accountable for them ---
defined precisely the limit of the report's political effect. The
transatlantic division of labour thus operates much like the division of
labour between the CIA and the Department of Justice.]{.underline}**
From the point of view of the US, Europe is not quite living up to its
commitments to burden sharing, being only of tacit and reluctant help.
Hence, **[the US has to carry most of the weight in the war on terror,
and, by implication, needs 'to get her hands dirty'.]{.underline}** From
a **[European]{.underline}** point of view, **[the factual degree of
involvement]{.underline}** comfortably **[pales in comparison with US
transgressions]{.underline}**. From the moral high ground, then, how
precisely Europe has been and still is involved becomes almost
invisible. Both Europe and the United States can cast their definitions
of the situation in terms of 'the West'. Europe holds up Western values
damaged in Guantanamo, Abu Ghraib, and Fallujah. The US, on the other
hand, actually does defend 'the West'. In between such conflicting
understandings of 'the West', political accountability evaporates. This
is precisely how a political logic of risk management13 operates: by
delegating away political responsibilities to anonymous layers of
technocratic and expertocratic competency, all the more clandestine if
intelligence agencies are involved. **[The depoliticising effect of
securitisation is thus routinised and tacitly institutionalised. Rather
than a situative response to a particular threat, which may be countered
and then go away, the practical consequences of securitisation can thus
be extended for an indefinite period of time --- by translating the
hyper-political logic of security into a bureaucratic logic of risk
management.]{.underline}**

**[Giving up on an essentialist conceptualisation and focusing instead
on performative references to and invocations of 'the West' by no means
dilutes the resulting image, as essentialisers often seem to fear. On
the contrary, it was only through an open, reconstructive focus on
manifold and fragmented uses of the West that we could render visible a
dynamic of genuinely 'Western' securitisation.]{.underline}**
**[Different articulations in scholarly and political discourse do not
add up to a coherent entity that can then be tagged as 'the West'.
Rather, 'the West' is quite literally an essentially contested concept
as it becomes politically efficacious only to the extent that it is
articulated in specific, locally and contextually circumscribed
situations]{.underline}**. However, all three research fields support
the conclusion that '**[the West' tends to be marked as normatively
valuable and preferable to that which is not Western.]{.underline}**
Furthermore, to the extent that it is cast as a threatened entity that
ought to be defended at all cost, that is, to the extent that **['the
West' is being securitised, it assumes the role of a discursive
attractor, as if it were a 'gravitational centre' that channels
political communication through a securitisation filter. With a
'securitised West' looming in the background, transatlantic discord
might not escalate to the point of open conflict and antagonism but
might rather remain tied to a particular structure of
conflict,]{.underline}** in which **[different articulations of how
precisely 'the West' ought to be defended are at stake. References to
'the West' as a carrier of collective identity, then, account for the
rapid build-up of rhetorical heat,]{.underline}** yet these very
references also delimit the possible scope of antagonism. At the same
time, however, as a **[selfsecuritising community 'the West' exerts a
discursive pull, which places the semantics of security and thus the
authorisation of extraordinary measures squarely at the centre of
political conduct. Self-assertion, self-authorisation, and
self-immunisation are just three institutional consequences of such a
securitisation pull.]{.underline}** In the case of NATO, these
**[dynamics of self-authorisation seem to be most obvious regarding the
reconstituting effects of its strategic discourse and its global
projection of (military) power today.]{.underline}** The debate on
'China's rise' and its consequences for the coherence and future of 'the
West' brings to mind the potential differences between the US and
European states where references to assumed universal values might
enhance a self-assertion of 'the West'. **[In the field of torture and
extraordinary renditions we can observe how the very principles of 'the
West' are undermined by the bureaucratic selfimmunisation against
political accountability. Obviously, the freelance authorisation of
means of violence in the wake of securitisation processes and the
accompanying tendencies of self-assertion and self-immunisation are
diametrically opposed to the self-understanding of 'the West' as a
community of liberal democracies]{.underline}**. Nested in such
self-descriptions, **[processes of securitisation cannot be
conceptualised as a one-way street, where a secular trend of militant
depoliticisation relentlessly rolls over whatever modest barriers to the
unilateral use of force have been erected. By prioritising executive
authorisation and a technocratic output orientation, securitisation
dynamics invoke, if only negatively, a legal--democratic 'culture of
formalism']{.underline}** (Koskenniemi 2001, 2009), which insists on
input legitimation, due process norms, and a rigid oversight of
executive authority. Bearing this in mind, both securitisation and
desecuritisation can be framed as uniquely and characteristically
Western projects. Hence, Western **[securitisation dynamics can only be
understood as a discursive shift away from a legally enshrined culture
of restraint and towards self-reinforcing processes of dramatisation and
escalation.]{.underline}** In other words, **[while processes of
securitisation are indeed dangerously self-reinforcing, they do not
operate in a vacuum, thus triggering escalation spirals and a contact
surface for public counter-reactions at the same time]{.underline}**.
They are nested not in a fixed set of shared values, but rather in a
distinctly Western structure of conflict where securitisation dynamics
and the desecuritising safeguards of legal formalism stand in polar
opposition. As discursive attractors they constitute gravitational
centres in an open force field of social interaction. They provide
alternative rationales and justification narratives, which collide in
everyday political practice. Whether securitisation dynamics
successfully trump attempts at politicisation, democratisation, or
constitutionalisation is a matter of open-ended social struggles where
each discursive shift alters a complex relational configuration, thus
opening up new avenues of contestation. **[Historically contingent and
reversible as it may be, however, in all three cases we do observe a
significant bias towards more assertive forms of selfauthorisation to
the detriment of formal-legal restraint. At present, the securitisation
pull seems to be stronger than the appeal of what used to be hailed as
core commitments of the Western community of states.]{.underline}**
Specifically, to the extent that the institutional infrastructure of the
West revolves centrally around NATO as a classical security institution
turned global security player, institutional reform is predicated on
imaginaries of the relative geopolitical position of 'the West'. As
China (and probably Russia) are being portrayed not only as competitors
but as potential threats to Western supremacy, realist sticks may gain
more leverage than liberal carrots in Western external relations.
**[Internally, the 'securitised West' further undermines what used to be
hailed as its normative foundation in the name of inevitable steps
towards its defence. In short, Western integration operates less on the
basis of shared norms and values of liberal democracies and more and
more through the institutionalisation of paranoia.]{.underline}**

#### Only by confronting torture's justification can the security logic of projected crises be confronted -- anything else creates threat inflation of catastrophes

In this paper, I argue that **[the deluge of commentary in the
mainstream media throughout 2009 and into 2010 constitutes a moment of
crisis in the struggle over how Americans think about torture in the
context of post-9/11 national-security politics.]{.underline}** I use
**[the word \"crisis\" to describe a moment when a polity-its political
culture]{.underline}**, legal and political institutions, **[public
discourse, and national identity-is likely to take a significant
turn.]{.underline}** On a few occasions prior to 2009- publication of
the Abu Ghraib photos in 2004, the McCain Amendment in 2005, Bush\'s
admission and defence of secret, \"alternative\" procedures in 2006-the
torture issue had risen to the level of national attention. I argue,
however, that both the substance and potential effects of the 2009
crisis differ from and surpass previous landmark events. In all but name
only**[, torture came to be openly defended and advocated as the right
course for America. During the years of denial and the deflection of
responsibility, the justification of torture, while asserted by a few,
had been advanced primarily through the world of televised
fantasy]{.underline}** in weekly versions of the tickingbomb scenario;
the series 24, with its popular hero Jack Bauer, did yeoman\'s duty for
an administration committed to hiding its torture policies. **[One can
now look back on the Bush years and easily recognise the obliquely
stated justifications for torture-the rhetoric of an evil, invisible,
superhuman, and subhuman enemy]{.underline}**, **[the language of
murderous violence and retribution]{.underline}**, the \"dark-side\",
\"gloves-off\" talk about necessity and \"whatever it takes**[\"-all
situated within the framework of existential threat, a state of
emergency,]{.underline}** and a \"war on terror\". In 2009, however,
**[the floodgates of justification of torture were
opened]{.underline}**. My central concern is in analysing the emerging
ideological formation of torture-the configuration of defences,
assumptions, and values underlying it, and its explicit or tacit
meanings. **[My focus will be on how the national-security justification
of torture has been advanced along with the various ideological
strategies employed on its behalf]{.underline}**. I am motivated in this
effort by the conviction **[that understanding the ideology of torture
is crucial for the struggle against torture,]{.underline}** especially
as regards whether those who authorised torture will be held accountable
and whether torture will be rejected by the American people or accepted
as a legitimate tool of interrogation in the arsenal of the military and
security agencies. **[Will the United States become a torture culture or
a culture guided by human rights and the rule of law]{.underline}**?
Even though, at the level of policy, President Obama\'s executive orders
reversed the torture policies of the previous administration, **[this
question is far from resolved.]{.underline}** Public-opinion polls show
considerable support in the United States for torture. Disturbingly,
throughout 2009, support for torture appears to have increased. A poll
released by the Pew Research Center in early December indicated that 54
per cent of respondents agreed that \"the use of torture to gain
information from suspected terrorists\" can be \"often justified\" or
\"sometimes justified\"-the first time in five years that this
combination of views reached a majority. Only 25 per cent said torture
could \"never be justified\". One possible explanation could be that the
Republican Party, many right-wingers more generally, and significant
sectors of the national-security apparatus have become outspoken
advocates for torture. **[They are highly critical of President Obama\'s
executive order ending torture and his approval of the release of the
secret memos about the Bush-Cheney torture policies]{.underline}**,
**[predict catastrophe unless torture is reinstated]{.underline}**,
**[and vehemently deplore any suggestion of criminal investigations of
torture\'s practitioners]{.underline}** or authorisers-a step they
characterise as \"criminalising policy differences\". All this points to
a vital need to understand the layered ideologies that justify torture
and to consider how deeply such justifications have penetrated American
culture.

Although human rights advanced with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989
and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, [the attainment of human
rights envisioned by the Declaration was never fully
achieved]{.underline}. In many contexts worldwide[, human rights have
been undermined by military dictatorships and totalitarian
states]{.underline}. Since 9/11 we have seen the ascendance of a culture
of security in the United States of America. T[his culture of security
has allowed internationally-proscribed, state-sponsored violations of
human rights in Guantánamo and elsewhere]{.underline}. New York Times
describes [Guantánamo as an affront to our fundamental values because
prisoners]{.underline} lack the right to legally defend themselves and
[are subject to torture "that can be repeated until it produces the
answer the Pentagon wants"]{.underline} (6/6/07). It describes American
secret prisons, kangaroo courts, and indefinite detention of prisoners
without charges as a "national disgrace" (7/15/07). [Security now
pervades everyday life in many ways for many people, including sporadic
orange alerts, heavily armed national guards at airports and public
transportation hubs, passport logjams, and visa denials and delays. The
culture of security and the culture of human rights are the political

I answer this question by describing [the ticking bomb hypothetical
scenario]{.underline}, often [mentioned by supporters and apologists for
U.S. government policies on detention and torture]{.underline}. The
scenario states that a time bomb is located in a major city. A suspect
in custody knows where the bomb is located, but will not talk. Would you
support torturing the suspect to obtain information that would save many
lives? This offers an argument (i.e., the ends justify the means) that
was used in the Algerian War to justify French torture of Algerian
separatists. [David Luban

hypothetical as sleight-of-hand reductionism "built on a set of
assumptions that amounts to intellectual fraud." It is designed to
reconfigure liberal reverence for human rights and "construct a liberal
ideology of torture, by which liberals reassure themselves]{.underline}
[that essential interrogational torture is detached from its illiberal
roots]{.underline}." It ends, he warns, "[by constructing a torture
culture]{.underline}" (all quotations p. 1427). Those who support the
institutionalization of violence and impunity in Guantánamo and other
open and secret U.S. prisons throughout the world would rather talk
about ticking bombs justifying torture than discuss torture as an
organized social practice. Psychologists studying violence know that
harm-doing is a slippery slope. As a result of a variety of social and
institutional influences, increasing escalation is more likely than
restraint. The hypothetical, designed to lessen restraint and ease
deviation from moral principles, deflects discussion about torture. It
deftly shifts the topic from values and ethics to security and
technicalities. As Luban describes, [The liberal ideology of torture,
which assumes that torture can be neatly confined to exceptional
ticking-bomb cases and surgically severed from cruelty and tyranny,
represents a dangerous delusion]{.underline}. It [becomes more
dangerous]{.underline} still coupled [with an endless war on
terror]{.underline}, a permanent emergency in which the [White House
eagerly insists that its emergency powers rise above the limiting power
of statutes and treaties]{.underline}. Claims to long-term emergency
powers that entail the power to torture should send chills through
liberals of the right as well as the left, and no one should still think
that liberal torture has nothing to do with tyranny. (p. 1461) In sum,
[the ticking bomb and related security-based scenarios pry people from

the price does tend to be oneself. (p. 10) A half century ago during

Japanese-American citizens]{.underline}. This is now widely understood
to have been wrong, short-sighted, and an affront to deeply held
American values of liberty and justice. [Like Guantánamo, it undermined
human rights and was justified by a culture of security. This suggests
that violating human rights and sidestepping international and national
laws and professional ethics will be remembered as wrong in the harsher
light of time]{.underline}. To conclude, I want to point out that the
tension between the culture of security and the culture of human rights
is not a clash between civilizations. It is a tension within this nation
and, as indicated in controversy over the American Psychological
Association\'s stance on psychologists\' involvement at
Guantanamo---within our professional association.

#### The use of torture as an interrogation technique furthers exceptionalism as a discourse used by the sovereign state -- that causes Islamophobia and the drive to combat the enemy

For Neal, the paradox of this conventional security/liberty debate is
its lack of a clear distinction between the two values since \"the
language of freedom and rights can be used both to legitimate and to
oppose violent and illiberal practices\" (p. 9). He turns to [the
discourse of exceptionalism and securitization theory to examine in
detail the relationships between liberty and security in classic and
contemporary political thought]{.underline} with particular attention to
the works of Thomas Hobbes, Emanuel Kant, Georgio Agamben, Carl Schmitt,
and Michel Foucault. Unlike the contemporary liberty-versus-security
debate, he stresses that classical political theory recognizes the
limits and contradictions of freedom. But [the centerpiece and most
valuable contribution to post 9/11 counterterrorism discourse---and
practices---is the author\'s critical analysis of Schmitt\'s theory of
exceptionalism, also in the context of securitization
theory]{.underline}, and Foucault\'s challenge to and rebuke of the
Schmittian tenet of the sovereign\'s absolute prerogative to decide
unilaterally what amounts to an exception and what extra-legal measures
can be taken in response to declared emergencies. In the book\'s most
interesting chapters 6 (\"Foucault in Guantanamo\") and 7 (\"The rise
and fall of Schmitt at the hands of Foucault and others\"), Neal
examines Foucault\'s archeological approach as antidote to the abstract
discourse of exceptionalism a la Schmitt. Here, [the issue of torture in
the United States is used to demonstrate that post-9/11 discourse of
exception was not in response to something completely new, not an
exceptional rupture, but rather \"a novel recombination of
already-existing discourses, mechanisms and modalities of power, some in
active use already, others reawakened from dormancy]{.underline}\" (p.
124). In the United States, [there were indeed earlier cases of
discourses of exception with executive overreaction.]{.underline} The
Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, [the Espionage Act of 1917, Sedition
Act of 1918, and the internment of Japanese Americans during World War
II serve as examples]{.underline}. And references to and comparisons
with earlier cases were part of the immediate post-9/11 mass-mediated
debate. On the day of the attacks, for example, anchors, correspondents,
and reporters of the three TV networks ABC, CBS, NBC, and their
interviewees and sources mentioned the term \"Pearl Harbor\" 58 times.
Yet, there was also immediate agreement that this was an utterly new
type of crisis that called for exceptional reactions. [Neal points
to]{.underline} Foucault-inspired [empirical research of]{.underline}
actual [practices in the war on terrorism, including Guantanamo, that
validate Foucault\'s rejection of a discourse of exceptionalism around
the central]{.underline} decision-making [power and \"locate
exceptionalism away from the sovereign center]{.underline} instead
locating it in dispersed officialdom\" (p. 148). To be sure, a multitude
of dispersed officials deal with and decide upon regulations and
operation procedures at all times---not only in the United States. This
was also the case in the post-9/11 years in many respects and many
places, including Guantanamo and similar US-run facilities. But [when it
comes to torture, other \"aggressive\" interrogation practices, and many
more violations of domestic and international law, cutting the King\'s
head off and looking for a multitude of little sovereigns would ignore
the starring role of central decision makers]{.underline}. Indeed, the
crucial role of the [Bush White House in]{.underline} both [the
discourse of exceptionalism and the manufacturing of unlawful responses
is well documented]{.underline}, [most thoroughly with respect to the
torturing of \"enemy combatants]{.underline}\" (Greenberg and Dratel
2005). In Counter-Terrorism, Aid, and Civil Society: Before and After
the War on Terror, Howell and Lind, too, deal with post-9/11 measures
and the effects of what they describe as an entrenched worldwide \"war
on terror\" regime on the relationships between government and civil
society in Western countries and elsewhere. While established in the
post-Cold War years as a result of increased military roles in
humanitarian and peacekeeping interventions, [the primacy of security
became more rigid as part of the war on terrorism that required groups
and individuals to make certain that none of their aid benefited
terrorists]{.underline}. Laws and regulations, Howell and Lind find,
handcuff \"INGOs and local groups working in conflict areas where
terrorists are alleged to operate\" (p. 73). A recent example was the
[2011 famine in parts of Somali controlled by]{.underline} [the Islamist
al-Shabaab]{.underline} organization known to have ties to A1 Qaeda.
[Aid groups were not only hindered by]{.underline} al-Shabaab violence
but also by [fears that they could violate laws prohibiting material
assistance to terrorists]{.underline} since some of the aid was likely
to fall into the hands of the Islamists. In this case, the Obama
administration exempted aid organization from the legal restraints and
promised new guidelines for Somalia that would allow emergency aid by
NGOs who pledged to do their best to keep aid from being exploited by a
dangerous terrorist group. While Washington\'s handling of the Somalia
famine was another manifestation of the Obama administration\'s more
flexible approach to counterterrorism, the authors conclude nevertheless
that [the overall security regime \"remains deeply entrenched in a thick
web of regulations, policies, laws, institutional arrangements, and
bureaucratic practices\"]{.underline} (p. 3). Ten years into the
Afghanistan War, there were frequent reports about deteriorating
security in spite of the troop surge ordered by President Obama and the
implementation of a comprehensive counterinsurgency (COIN) strategy.
COIN requires troops to live in close proximity to civil populations,
win people\'s trust, and build or rebuild not only schools and hospitals
and infrastructure important, governmental institutions and processes as
well as civic society. While in theory suited for a division of labor
between the military and civilian development agencies, retired Army
colonel Douglas Macgregor concluded that [the counterinsurgency model
\"essentially rebrands the military, expanding its authority (and its
funding) to encompass the diplomatic and political sides of
warfare:]{.underline} Think the Green Berets as an armed Peace Corps\"
(Hastings 2010). Howell and Lind found that the [military\'s
involvement]{.underline} in both hard and soft measures [has adverse
effects on NGOs]{.underline} and their work [because]{.underline}
linking and subordinating development efforts to military strategy
\"[poses strategic and moral dilemmas for NGOs, which wish to prioritize
human security and claim neutrality and impartiality in their
operations]{.underline}\" (p. 111[). The result is that international
NGOs lose credibility and effectiveness]{.underline} among Afghans and
become increasingly targets of attacks. A few weeks into his presidency,
President Barack Obama (2009) summarized the objectives in Afghanistan
and neighboring Pakistan, when he said, \"I want the American people to
understand that we have a clear and focused goal: to disrupt, dismantle
and defeat al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and to prevent their
return to either country in the future. That is the goal that must be
achieved. That is a cause that could not be more just.\" But Vice
President Joe Biden\'s advice to limit the Afghan military effort to the
deployment of US Special Operations Forces with the exclusive goal to
defeat al Qaeda was rejected by Obama. Biden\'s model, a small force
with narrow military objectives, would have decreased the military\'s
predominance in the area of development and, presumably, led to more
positive effects on the work of NGOs and Afghan civil society. As Howell
and Lind note, \"the idea that a peaceful civil society can flourish or
be strengthened in a context of armed conflict and where military
interventions in development are accompanied by weapons of coercion is
paradoxical\" (p. 128). [Ten years after 9/11, security concerns in the
United States and Europe continued to focus mostly, if not exclusively
on Muslim communities and the risk of their members\'
radicalization.]{.underline} Although terrorism by white supremacy and
anti immigration actors was on the rise long before the July 2011
attacks in Norway, the exceptional security regime continued to single
out Muslim communities and groups. In the United States, when the
administration looked beyond Muslims as the usual suspects, political
factions resented the more realistic approach. Thus, [when in early 2009
the US Department of Homeland Security released a report about a
potential threat of terrorism by right-wing extremists inside the United
States]{.underline}, including some disgruntled veterans, [there was
such a storm of protests by conservatives that the document was
withdrawn]{.underline}. Since then, the virus of [Islamophobia that
infected Europe earlier spread in the United States as
well]{.underline}. In the hours, weeks, and months after the 9/11
strikes, there were many voices in the news that emphasized the profound
differences between the architects and perpetrators of the terrorist
spectacular, on the one hand, and the mass of peaceful Muslims and their
religion, on the other. On the day of the attacks, for example, New York
City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said during an ad hoc news conference, \"Nobody
should engage in group blame\.... Nobody should blame any group of
people or any nationality or any ethnic group\" (Federal News Service
2001). He assured Arabs and Muslims in New York City of special police
protection and warned that anyone trying to harass them would be
arrested. But as time went by, divisive voices became more numerous and
louder than conciliatory ones. During the heated debates and angry
protests concerning the so-called Ground Zero mosque, Giuliani called
the planned project \"a desecration\" and noted that \"\[n\]obody would
allow something like that at Pearl Harbor. Let us have some respect for
who died there an died there\" (Haberman 2010). Distinguishing between
\"good\" and \"bad\" civil society, the counterterrorism regime reserved
the problematic side mostly for Muslim groups and individuals.
Increasingly, non-Muslims came to accept the good/bad divide. As Howell
and Lind observe, \"the silence of mainstream civil society in respect
of the targeting of Muslim communities and the violation of civil
liberties has been alarming\" (p. 73). [The construction of Muslims and
Islam as inherently problematic and related to terrorism, on the one
hand, and the rejection and modification of that construct, on the other
hand, guide the discussions and arguments]{.underline} that 16 authors
make in the volume, Debating the War of Ideas, edited by Patterson and
Gallagher. Albeit more scholarly, theoretical, and less passionate, the
narratives reflect the sharp divisions in the current public debate
about compatibility and incompatibility of Western Judeo-Christian and
Eastern Islamic religious, cultural, and political doctrines and
traditions. [Several authors argue that the jihadist war on the United
States and other democracies is not simply fought by extremists who
misuse their religion but that the roots of this sort of terrorism are
at the core of Islam itself. These authors point to passages in the
Quran and how violent Islamists use this text to justify their
deeds]{.underline}. To drive this point home, Raymond Ibrahim ends his
essay (chapter 5) with the same quote by nineteenth-century philosopher
James Lorimer that he mentions on a previous page: \"So long as Islam
endures, the reconciliation of its adherents, even with Jews and
Christians, and still more with the rest of mankind, must continue to be
an insoluble problem.\" Robert Spencer (chapter 16) and Walid Phares
(chapter 2) have harsh words for those in the West who defend Islam, the
religion, and differentiate between peaceful mainstream Muslims and
militant Islamists. Among their culprits are former presidents Bill
Clinton and George W. Bush, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
current president Barack Obama, the mainstream media (Spencer), and
government advisers from an \"academia sympathetic to Islamists\"
(Phares). Presumably, they put several of their fellow contributors to
this volume into the group of apologists, Karen Armstrong (chapter 4)
among them. Noting that Muslim extremists cite passages from the Koran
selectively to justify jihad, she reminds Westerners that \"there is far
more violence in both the Jewish scriptures and the New Testament than
in the Quran.\" Still other authors argue that [the discourse that
matters most is taking place inside Muslim societies between absolutists
or militant Islamists on the one side and pluralists or reformist
Muslims on the other. But whether they see most of all a struggle within
Muslim communities or a clash between the Western and Muslim worlds,
most authors are either uncertain or gloomy concerning the ultimate
outcome of this \"war of ideas.\"]{.underline} While contributors to
Debating the War of Ideas or other authors have discussed similar topics
and taken similar positions elsewhere, Patterson and Gallagher managed
to select and present a wide range of views in a single volume that is
accessible to college students and interested general readers. What
Howell and Lind reveal about the links between counterterrorism, aid and
development, and civil society in their interesting volume should be of
particular interest for students of international and public affairs as
well as officials in governments, including military leaders, and
international and domestic NGOs in donor and recipient countries.

students, but decision makers would be well advised to read and learn

The road from terror to torture is, alas, well-traveled. **[Fuelled by
narrative constructs that evoke fear and anger, we embark on exercises
in moral reconstruction and legal exceptionalism]{.underline}** \--
**[rendering permissible (sometimes even mandating) what would otherwise
be prohibited and making inevitable what would otherwise be
inconceivable]{.underline}**. Oliver Wendell Holmes once observed that
**[\"most people reason dramatically, not
quantitatively\"]{.underline}** (Myers 56). A century later
**[behavioral economists told us that, most of all, we fear \"dread
risks\" \-- uncontrollable low-probability, high-consequence
events,]{.underline}** such as mass terror attacks (see Slovic 283). The
vivid and devastating collapse of the Twin Towers provided evidence in
support of both claims. **[It gave us a \"terrorscopic\" vision of the
world in which we are constantly under threat from Islamic
fundamentalism, rebranded \"Islamofascism\"]{.underline}** (on this,
see, e.g., Safire; Pollitt) There is no denying that Al Qaeda poses a
real threat to the lives of US-Americans (among others). However, **[we
fear calamitous acts of terrorism in the \"homeland\" more than we fear
a plethora of chronic and pedestrian risks, although the latter have (to
date) caused many more fatalities than domestic
terrorism.]{.underline}** At least 18,000 people under the age of 65 die
prematurely every year in the United States for lack of health insurance
(Institute of Medicine 5); more than 40,000 USAmericans die in road
traffic accidents, the leading cause of death for those between three
and thirtythree (see Subramanian), and those unfortunate enough to be
both uninsured and involved in a car accident have a 37% greater chance
of dying than insured victims. We are, however, inured to these
quotidian risks, despite the magnitude of the losses they cause, and we
focus instead on our dread risks, both real and imagined. This is why,
in the months following the attacks on 11 September 2001, many of us
took to the roads to make long journeys instead of flying \-- a decision
that now seems illadvised, given the resulting spike in road traffic
fatalities (see Gigerenzer). **[The impact of basic emotions, such as
anger or fear, whether evoked by terrorism or other risks, is felt
beyond the sphere of individual behavior]{.underline}** (see Marks,
\"What Counts\", \"The Power\"). **[They undoubtedly shape our policy
preferences \-- whether we are inside government (on this, see Tenet) or
outside it.]{.underline}** This was starkly revealed by a study
conducted in the months after 9/11 (see Lerner, Gonzalez, Small,
Fischhoff). **[Half the subjects in the study group were conditioned by
audio-visual stimuli to feel anger; the other half were primed to feel
fear. The fear-conditioned group favored conciliatory and
capacity-building responses, such as strengthening ties with Muslim
countries and improving public health infrastructure. The
anger-conditioned group, on the other hand, preferred poorly-targeted or
untargeted punitive responses, such as the mass deportation of
foreigners without valid visas \-- a measure that, according to one
recent estimate, would cost the United States around \$230 billion over
a five year period (see Goyle and Jaeger).]{.underline}** As I have
argued elsewhere, **[basic emotions such as fear and anger may multiply
and become amplified across groups and populations]{.underline}** (see
Marks, \"What Counts\" 574-78). Without doubt, this is a complex
process, one mediated by social, political and constitutional
structures, as well as culture, history and collective memory (or
collective amnesia). **[But it may help explain the results of a survey
conducted in 2004 \-- after the photos of detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib
were first published]{.underline}** \-- **[in which almost one quarter
of the US-American respondents agreed that it was \"too restrictive\" to
say that governments should never use torture]{.underline}**, **[but
said]{.underline}** that it would be **[unacceptable for a foreign
government ever to use torture against an American
detainee]{.underline}** (see Kull, Ramsay, Subias, Weber, Lewis).
**[More than half of respondents described as \"convincing\" the view
that \"given what we learned from the 9/11 attacks, we cannot afford to
tie our hands by declaring off limits any method for getting information
that could be useful in the war on terrorism\"]{.underline}** (Kull,
Ramsay, Subias, Weber, Lewis 7). The survey respondents were clearly
suffering from what Timor Kuran has termed **[\"moral
dissonance\"]{.underline}** (Kuran 233), as they grappled with competing
moral imperatives. **[Torture is bad, and must be stopped. Terrorism is
bad, and must be stopped. But to stop terrorism, we need torture
(provided, of course, that we are not the victims)]{.underline}**. Or so
the reasoning Jonathan H. Marks, \"goes. **[This type of analysis is not
the sole province of survey respondents.]{.underline}** **[It has taken
hold of many in the academy too.]{.underline}** The political scientist,
Michael Gross, framed the issue in a similar way: \"**[Humanitarian law
forbids torture and terror. But if torture is necessary to prevent
terror, something has to give; one cannot unequivocally condemn
both\"]{.underline}** (Gross 235; emphases in the original). Similarly
seduced by the torture imperative \-- or by the belief that others
presented with it will inevitably succumb \-- the Harvard legal scholar,
Alan **[Dershowitz, went further in his analysis and proposed a system
of \"torture warrants\" to be issued by a judge ex ante]{.underline}**
(Dershowitz 131-65), **[designed to give a patina of legitimacy to what
would otherwise be considered a flagrant violation of fundamental human
rights.]{.underline}** Although some in the academy have spoken out
firmly against torture (see, e.g., Waldron; Luban), many mused on paper
about whether the torture ban is sustainable in light of the threat that
Al Qaeda terrorism presents (see McKelvey). Slavoj Žižek has been
critical of fellow academics and commentators for writing essays that
\"introduce \[torture\] as a legitimate topic of debate,\" arguing that
they are \"even more dangerous than an explicit endorsement of torture\"
which would be \"too shocking\" (103). **[He notes that the debate tends
to legitimize torture and \"changes the background of ideological
presuppositions and options much more radically than its outright
advocacy]{.underline}**\" (Žižek 104). Although Sanford Levinson, a
liberal constitutional lawyer, noted Žižek\'s critique of the torture
debate, it did not discourage him from agonizing about the legitimacy of
torture in several articles and a collection of essays which he also
edited (see, e.g., Levinson). So what ineluctable force compels
ordinarily well intentioned academics to rend the fabric of their
liberal mantle and turn, reluctantly, to a coarser cloth? **[It should
come as no surprise that, in a world of vivid images, there is a
powerful image that fuels the torture imperative. That image is, of
course, the \"ticking bomb\"]{.underline}** (Dershowitz 131). **[It is
most vivid in the mind of the beholder \-- who tends to locate it, to
maximum effect, in the heart of a city in which one\'s nearest and
dearest live.]{.underline}** In **[dramatic
representations]{.underline}**, the ticking device is often a digital
clock - - as in the History Channel\'s The Dark Art of Interrogation,
inspired by Mark Bowden\'s well-known article of the same title.
Sometimes the \"device\" is an Al Qaeda suicide bomber, primed and
waiting for a prearranged time in order to detonate the device (see
\"Dirty War\"). **[The bombs intended to be the subjects of our fear are
sometimes nuclear devices \-- in which case, they are
truly]{.underline}** \"The Sum of All Fears.\" At other times, they are
\"dirty bombs,\" munitions that cannot trigger a nuclear explosion, but
generate fear by scattering radioactive isotopes over a wide area (see
\"Dirty War\"). **[The popular]{.underline}** Fox **[television
series,]{.underline}** 24, regularly **[present]{.underline}**s its
hero, CIA operative Jack Bauer, **[with torture imperatives fueled by
imminent explosions and accompanied by extradiegetic music that
predictably derives its urgent beat from a ticking sound]{.underline}**.
In the first five seasons of the show, there were \-- by one count \--
**[67 torture scenes]{.underline}** (Mayer, 68). 24 **[may be fictional,
but it clearly has an impact on the real world.]{.underline}** In
November 2006, U.S. Army Brigadier General Patrick Finnegan, the dean of
the United States Military Academy at West Point, flew to Southern
California to meet the creators of the series. **[He came to voice
concern that the show\'s premise \-- that fundamental norms must be
violated in the interests of national security \-- was having a \"toxic
effect\"]{.underline}** (Mayer 72). **[He called for the show to stop or
at least change its approach, arguing that it made U.S.-Americans
\"generally more comfortable and more accepting\" of detainee abuse and
that it \"promoted unethical and illegal behavior and had adversely
affected the training and performance of real American
soldiers\"]{.underline}** (Mayer 72-73). In recent years, Hollywood
**[has rarely warned us of the perils of torture.]{.underline}** Some
cautionary words were voiced by one character in the The Siege (1998)
\-- a troubled and controversial film that predicts eerily both
interagency tensions in the wake of September 11 and the use of nudity
as an interrogation tactic. FBI agent Anthony \"Hub\" Hubbard (played by
Denzel Washington) issues a warning to Major General William Devereaux
(Bruce Willis) in the presence of CIA operative Elise Kraft (Annette
Bening) and a naked detainee who is fearfully muttering Arabic: \"if we
torture him, General, we do that and everything we have fought, and
bled, and died for is over. And they\'ve won. They\'ve already won!\"
(the warning proves futile; the FBI agent is escorted out of the room,
and the detainee is tortured). When he turns out to have no intelligence
value, as Hub also predicted, the detainee is subsequently killed in an
offscreen summary execution signaled by a gunshot sound. For the greater
part, however, ticking bomb dramas invite us to see \-- and feel \-- the
torture imperative. **[They ask us to understand and forgive
interrogational torture]{.underline}**, **[and to distinguish it from
torture in which a legitimizing intelligence objective is
lacking.]{.underline}** The success of this enterprise is demonstrated
by two recent movie trailers which implicitly acknowledge that it is
neither novel nor challenging to extract sympathy with ticking bomb
narratives. **[Recognizing our acclimatization to interrogational
torture, they seek to develop a voyeuristic appetite for cruelty that is
unmitigated in its gratuity.]{.underline}** In Hostel (2005), the
trailer promises \"a place where all your darkest sickest fantasies are
possible, where you can experience anything you desire, where you can
torture, punish or kill for a price.\" The words flash on the screen in
short segments, interspersed with images of a man tied to a chair, a
display table of dirty surgical instruments, a human toe wedged between
the menacing blades of a pair of pliers, and a hand wielding a revving
drill. **[As if our appetites for the pain of others were inexhaustible,
the]{.underline}** trailer for Saw III features images of whirring saws
and the voice of a woman pleading (\"Please don\'t do this\"). It ends
with a gravelly voiceover: \"Suffering. You haven\'t seen anything
yet.\" **[These trailers exploit the theatricality on which much real
torture depends]{.underline}** (on this, see McCoy 76-83) **[and
undoubtedly call for sociological and psychological analysis in their
own right.]{.underline}** However, I leave this analysis for others;
instead**[, I explore how the ticking bomb has captured the public
imagination and inspired a torture-tolerant culture despite two
inconvenient truths:]{.underline}** **[that ticking time bomb scenarios
are more fictive than real and, even if such a scenario could and did
arise, torture would not be the \"magic bullet.\"]{.underline}** Since
my primary purpose here is to describe the emotive force of ticking bomb
scenarios and the means by which we have responded to them, I will not
set out an exhaustive argument in support of these two claims---an
exercise others have already conducted, in my view, persuasively (see,
e.g.; Luban; Buffachi, and Arrigo). However, some powerful evidence in
support should be briefly noted.

#### Means of controlling the distribution of torture devices legitimizes torture writ large

**Žižek 02** \[Slavoj, senior researcher at the Institute for Sociology
and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana\], (04-01-2002, \"WELCOME
TO THE DESERT OF THE REAL!\",
http://www.rebels-library.org/files/zizek_welcome.pdf, accessed
7-4-2019), //Snitty

The obscenity of such statements is blatant. First, why use the WTC
attacks as justification? Are there not much more horrible crimes going
on around the world all the time? Secondly, what is new about this idea?
Did the CIA not teach the Latin American and Third World American
military allies the practice of torture for decades? Hypocrisy has gone
on for decades\.... **[Even Alan Dershowitz\'s much-quoted \'liberal\'
argument is suspicious: \'I\'m not in favour of torture, but if you\'re
going to have it, it should damn well have court
approval]{.underline}**.\' **[The underlying logic- \'Since we are doing
it in any case, better to legalize it, and thus prevent excesses!\'- is
extremely dangerous: it gives legitimacy to torture, and thus opens up
the space for more illicit torture]{.underline}**. When, along the same
lines**[, Dershowitz argues that torture in the \'ticking clock\'
situation is not against the prisoner\'s rights as an accused
person]{.underline}** (the information obtained will not be used in a
trial against him, and the torture is done not as punishment, only in
order to prevent the mass killing to come), **[the underlying premise is
even more disturbing: so one should be allowed to torture people not as
part of a deserved punishment, but simply because they know
something?]{.underline}** Why, **[then, not also legalize the torture of
prisoners of war who may possess information which may save hundreds of
our soldiers\' lives]{.underline}**? **[Against liberal Dershowitz\'s
honesty, we should therefore paradoxically stick to the apparent
\'hypocrisy\': OK, we can well imagine that in a specific situation,
confronted with the proverbial \'prisoner who knows\' and whose words
can save thousands, we would resort to torture- even (or, rather,
precisely) in such a case, however, it is absolutely crucial that we do
not elevate this desperate choice into a universal principle; following
the unavoidable brutal urgency of the moment, we should simply do it.
Only in this way, in the very inability or prohibition to elevate what
we had to do into a universal principle, do we retain the sense of
guilt, the awareness of the inadmissibility of what we have
done.]{.underline}**

**[A 2012 study]{.underline}** published in Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences **[reported a considerable \"decrease in functional
connectivity\" between the prefrontal lobes of the brain and other parts
of the brain after ECT.]{.underline}** The most extensive long-term
follow-up study indicates that \"most ECT patients will never recover
from the damage in the form of persistent severe mental
deficits.\"\[23\]

Austin, Texas**[, psychologist John Breeding]{.underline}**, who heads
the Coalition for the Abolition of Electroshock, said, \"**[The bottom
line is that ECT \'works\' to the extent that it damages and disables
the brain]{.underline}**.\"\[24\] **[Breeding dispels psychiatric
theories that the procedure is safer today than its]{.underline}** \"One

more potential for harm than ever. Much higher voltages are employed in
the modern procedure because muscle relaxants and anesthetics raise the
seizure threshold, with more electricity required to produce a
seizure]{.underline}**. The greater heat and electricity themselves
cause more brain cell death, he says. He concludes \"Given what we know
about the resulting brain damage, I think this is a form of
assault...\"\[25\]

**[Leading ECT researcher and advocate]{.underline}**,

in Neuropsychopharmacology, Sackeim and colleagues acknowledged that
**[ECT may cause permanent amnesia and permanent deficits in cognitive
abilities, which affect ability to function.]{.underline}**\[27\]

In 2005, Santa Barbara Superior Court Judge Denise de Bellefeuille ruled
that a psychiatrist and Santa Barbarapsychiatric facility deceived its
patients by failing to tell them that ECT causes irreversible memory
loss. The psychiatrist (who had performed shock treatment for over 20
years), admitted that neither he nor anyone else understands how shock
treatment works, and that the consent form Johnson provided to patients
was \"decidedly misleading in a critical regard,\" concerning the
permanency of memory loss.\[28\]

**[Last year, psychologist John Read, professor of clinical psychology
at the University of East London concluded from a comprehensive review

justified.\"\[]{.underline}**29\]

Eastgate says, \"**[To treat mental problems by electric shocks is

### 2AC -- Law enforcement equipment abused

#### Law enforcement equipment causes more harm, Georgia Proves

**Farha and Wraith 15**

46-47// WhtCbn

The implications of the deployment of law-enforcement technologies for a
state are shown by **[the situation in Georgia]{.underline}**, where
**[the use of less-lethal weapons]{.underline}**, in particular
riot-control ammunition, has historical significance. On 9 April 1989,
in what became known as the 'April 9 Tragedy', **[an anti-Soviet
demonstration in Tbilisi was violently dispersed by Soviet troops
resulting in significant loss of life and many injuries]{.underline}**.
As part of the Soviet response to the demonstrations, **[significant
quantities of riot control agents,]{.underline}** purported to be CS and
CN gas, **[were used.]{.underline}** A Parliamentary Commission inquiry
into the events that unfolded on 9 April 1989 found that the use of
**[riot control agents had contributed to the deaths of
demonstrators.]{.underline}** The Soviet response to the protests
arguably contributed to the emergence of an independent Georgia, with
the Supreme Council of the Republic of Georgia declaring independence
from the Soviet Union in 1991, on the second anniversary of the 9 April
1989 Tragedy. Since then, Georgia has gravitated more strongly to the
West, in particular to the USA and the EU. Under President Saakashvili,
who was elected on a democratic mandate as part of the Rose Revolution,
the alignment westwards continued at pace with a corresponding cooling
in the already frosty relationship with Russia. This **[Western
alignment was]{.underline}** also refle**[cted in the equipment observed
being deployed by Georgian police forces against
demonstrations]{.underline}** in 2007, 2009 and 2011 **[against
corruption and what was perceived as increasing
authoritarianism]{.underline}** by Saakashvili's administration. During
these demonstrations, **[demonstrators were met by riot police
using]{.underline}** a variety of systems, including **[long-range
acoustic weapons, tear gas and a variety of launched kinetic-impact
weapons]{.underline}**, including the FN 303 system. A HRW report
published in the wake of the 2007 protests documented the use of riot
control agents in confined spaces, **[the firing of rubber bullets at
close range at fleeing protestors]{.underline}**, and the deployment and
use of water cannons and acoustic weapons. The report states:
**[Georgian law-enforcement officers resorted too quickly to the use of
force, including simultaneous use of canisters of tear gas and rubber
bullets, without fully exhausting non-violent methods of crowd
dispersal.]{.underline}** There was no apparent measured or
proportionate escalation of the use of force either to disperse
demonstrators or to respond to sporadic violence.120 **[The
protests]{.underline}** in Georgia (and particularly the 2007 protests)
**[demonstrate that]{.underline}**, without proper oversight and
control, **[law-enforcement officials may easily misuse the equipment
available to them]{.underline}**. It is difficult to state what the
police response may have been had large quantities of tear gas and
rubber bullets not been available to them. However, it is certain that
the use of such **[large quantities of riot-control ammunition, and the
indiscriminate way in which such devices were used, hastened the end of
the]{.underline}** Saakashvili **[regime]{.underline}**. The irony is,
therefore, that the indiscriminate use of riot control agents hastened
the end of the Soviet Union's hold on Georgia, and may have had a
similar effect on Georgia's first democratically elected president.

for police and correctional agencies and policy makers on the use of
specific less lethal weapons and restraints, as detailed in each
section. There are also some cross-cutting issues common to many, if not
all, less lethal equipment and restraints. These include: n **[Issues of

or the people you love. However, torturing terrorists -- either for
vengeance or to try to extract information quickly -- backfires. It

not to come forward with information they have. It helps terrorist
groups recruit a new class of individuals that are now even more
motivated against you]{.underline}**. Those statements are based on a
very good piece of peer reviewed scholarship by James I. Walsh and James
A. Piazza. In their piece, **[they look at how the number of terrorist
attacks]{.underline}** -- either domestic or international -- in a
country in a given year **[is influenced by how that country treats its
citizens]{.underline}** (ie whether it tortures them or otherwise abuses
their physical integrity). They are really good at statistics and their
analysis controls for lots of different factors which could influence
the number of terror attacks in a country (like the country's economy,
its population size, and whether it is at war) and accounts for issues
of causal timing. Across the board, however, they find that **[countries
that use torture]{.underline}** and other repressive practices more
frequently **[are at greater risk for more terrorism.]{.underline}** For
democracies like the United States, abusing a person's physical
integrity backfires, **[leading to longer-lasting terrorist

increased risk that the terrorist group gets what they
want]{.underline}**. People have higher expectations for democracies: we
expect that a dictator might treat their citizens poorly but we expect
more from a democratic leader. So do terrorists and terrorist
sympathizers. So, **[terrorist groups]{.underline}** actually **[get a
boost when democracies increase their use of abusive]{.underline}**
practices. **[This]{.underline}** boost **[helps them recruit and keeps
existing terrorists committed to the cause]{.underline}**. Those
statements are based on another piece of peer-reviewed research, this
time by Ursula E. Daxecker and Michael L. Hess. They look at terrorist
organizations from all over the world and their longevity from 1970 to
2006 and then whether these organizations "won" against the government.
They run a ton of robustness tests (taking out splinter groups, using
different codings of their variables, etc) and still find that **[the
use of physical integrity abuses is counterproductive in
democracies]{.underline}**. Just because a dictatorship can torture its
population doesn't mean that we should. If you value "freedom" as much
as your Facebook posts imply, wanting your government to torture could
end up hurting you or someone you love. **[The level of
violence]{.underline}** -- how deadly and destructive it is -- from
insurgents and terrorists **[will increase if you abuse your
population]{.underline}**. Accounts of torture, political
disappearances, and other physical integrity rights abuses can easily
become rallying cries for terrorists. Just think -- if I knew that your
mom had been tortured, I'd make sure we all talk bad about those who
tortured her at the next family reunion! People outside of our hometown
aren't that different. **[If they know about a government's use of
torture, they will tell these stories to others. They'll show up to
terrorist meetings and devote their hard-earned money to carry out
bigger and better attacks]{.underline}**. In the end, torture and other
physical integrity rights abuses may make you feel like you've had
vengeance. It could make a terrorist "talk" (although, they usually
don't tell the truth in this situation). But, this **[abuse will help
create a more destructive wave of attacks in the future.]{.underline}**

#### No nuke terror\-\--detection solves and no expertise

**Seitz 16** (Sam, Director of Nuclear Security Studies @ the Global
Intelligence Trust, "Why WMD Terrorism Isn't as Scary as it Seems"
https://politicstheorypractice.wordpress.com/2016/08/26/why-wmd-terrorism-isnt-as-scary-as-it-seems/)

Of all the potential WMD terror attacks, nuclear attacks seem to
generate the most fear among the public. This is not surprising. After
all, nuclear weapons represent the pinnacle of humans' destructive
potential, and Hollywood frequently utilizes nuclear weapons to drive
the plot in movies ranging from Dr. Strangelove to The
Avengers. Fortunately, though, **[there is very little risk of
terrorists acquiring or detonating nuclear weapons]{.underline}**,
particularly in large, Western metropolises. The reason for this is
simple; **[[it is exceedingly difficult]{.mark} for terrorists [to
acquire and transport nuclear weapons without being detected and
stopped]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[First, [terrorists would have to
break into heavily guarded facilities]{.mark}]{.underline}**, likely in
Russia or the United States, **[and steal weapons weighing multiple
tons. Then]{.underline}**, after securing the weapons, these
**[terrorists would need to escape while being pursued by elite security
forces]{.underline}**. Assuming the terrorists are able to escape,
**[they would]{.underline}** **[then [need highly skilled technicians to
assemble the]{.mark}]{.underline}** nuclear
**[[device]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as nuclear weapons held in storage
are almost always broken down into their constituent parts so as to
prevent unauthorized use. The **[terrorists would have to do this [while
being sought after by the most powerful]{.mark} and well-funded
[intelligence networks in the world, and]{.mark} would [then]{.mark}
need to [transport the]{.mark} nuclear [device into a major city without
being detected]{.mark}. According to John Mueller, an expert on nuclear
terrorism at Ohio State University]{.underline}**, the **[[risk of a
successful]{.mark} nuclear terrorist [attack]{.mark} occurring
[is]{.mark}, therefore, less than [one in three
billion]{.mark}]{.underline}** (1).

Certain analysts contend that while the risk of terrorists stealing
nuclear weapons is low, it is possible that terrorists might simply
construct their own nuclear devices instead. This scenario is even less
likely than nuclear theft, though, as the production of nuclear weapons
is an exceedingly complicated task. **[Terrorists would need highly
specific blueprints detailing how to construct a nuclear device, access
to highly enriched uranium or plutonium, and a secure, well-equipped
site to construct the weapon]{.underline}**. As Mueller points out, the
odds of all of these conditions being met are quite low. Moreover,
**[the [need for]{.mark} so [many]{.mark} complex and [uncommon
materials -- h]{.mark}ighly [e]{.mark}nriched [u]{.mark}ranium, [heavy
industrial equipment, etc. -- would raise suspicion]{.mark} among
intelligence analysts, [increasing]{.mark} the [chance of
detection]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[Even if]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[intelligence [agencies missed]{.mark} these [clues]{.mark} one of the
many [middle-men]{.mark} used to acquire these materials [might
inform]{.mark} on the terrorist network, either [for profit or]{.mark}
because of [moral qualms]{.mark}]{.underline}** (1).

#### No Nuclear Terrorism

The possibility that small groups could set off nuclear weapons is an
alarm that has been raised repeatedly over the decades. **[However,
terrorist [groups]{.mark} thus far [seem to have exhibited]{.mark} only
[limited desire and]{.mark} even less [progress in going
atomic]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Perhaps, after a brief exploration of the
possible routes, they have discovered that the tremendous effort
required is scarcely likely to succeed.

**[One route a would-be atomic terrorist]{.underline}** might take
**[would be to [receive or buy]{.mark} a bomb from a generous,
like-minded nuclear state]{.underline}** for delivery abroad. **[That
[route]{.mark}]{.underline}**, however, **[[is highly improbable. The
risk would be too great]{.underline}]{.mark}**---**[even for a country
led by extremists]{.underline}**---that the source of the weapon would
ultimately be discovered. Here, the rapidly developing science (and art)
of **["[nuclear forensics]{.mark}"]{.underline}**---connecting nuclear
materials to their sources even after a bomb has been
detonated---**[[provides]{.mark} an important
[deterrent]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Moreover[, **[the weapon could
explode]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in a manner or
[on]{.mark}]{.underline}** a target **[[the donor]{.mark} would not
approve]{.underline}**---including, potentially, the donor itself.
Almost no one, for example, is likely to trust al Qaeda: its explicit
enemies list includes all Middle Eastern regimes, as well as the
governments of Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, and Russia. And the Islamic
State, or ISIS, which burst onto the international scene in 2014, has
alienated just about every state on the planet.

Nuclear-armed states are unlikely to give or sell their precious weapons
to nonstate actors. Some observers, though, worry about "loose nukes,"
especially in post-Communist Russia---meaning weapons, "suitcase bombs"
in particular, that can be stolen or bought illicitly. However, as a
former director at the Los Alamos National Laboratory notes, "Regardless
of what is reported in the news, **[[all nuclear nations take]{.mark}
the [security of]{.mark} their [weapons]{.mark} very
[seriously]{.mark}."]{.underline}** Careful assessments have concluded
that **[[it is unlikely]{.mark} that any nuclear [devices have been
lost]{.mark}]{.underline}** and that, **[[regardless]{.mark}, their
[effectiveness would be]{.mark}]{.underline}** very low or even
**[[nonexistent because]{.mark} nuclear [weapons require]{.mark}
continual [maintenance]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[Moreover, [finished bombs are outfitted]{.mark} with devices designed
[to trigger a nonnuclear explosion that will destroy the bomb if it is
tampered]{.mark} with. [Bombs]{.mark}]{.underline}** can also be
**[[kept disassembled with]{.mark} the component [parts stored in
separate]{.mark} high-security [vaults]{.mark}]{.underline}** (a common
practice in Pakistan). Two or more people and multiple codes may be
required not only to use the bomb, but also to store, maintain, and
deploy it.

There could be dangers in the chaos that would emerge if a nuclear state
were to fail, collapsing in full disarray. However, even under those
conditions, nuclear weapons would still have locks or be disassembled
and would likely remain under heavy guard by people who know that a
purloined bomb would most likely end up going off in their own
territory.

Most analysts believe that a terrorist group's most promising route
would be to attempt to make a bomb using purloined fissile material---
plutonium or highly enriched uranium. However, as the Gilmore
Commission---the advisory panel on terrorism and weapons of mass
destruction---stressed, **[[building]{.mark} and deploying [a nuclear
device presents "Herculean challenges."]{.mark}]{.underline}** The
process requires a lengthy sequence of steps; if each is not fully met,
the result is not simply a less powerful weapon, but one that can't
produce any significant nuclear yield at all or can't be delivered.

**[[First, the terrorists would]{.mark} need to steal or illicitly
purchase [the]{.mark} crucial [plutonium or]{.mark} highly enriched
[uranium]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This would most likely require the
corruption of a host of greedy confederates, **[including
[brokers]{.mark} [and]{.mark} money
[transmitters]{.mark}]{.underline}**, any one of whom could **[[turn on
the terrorists]{.underline}]{.mark}** or, out of either guile or
incompetence, furnish them with material that is useless. Any **[[theft
would]{.mark} also likely [trigger an intense]{.mark} international
[policing effort]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Second, to manufacture a bomb, **[[the terrorists would need]{.mark} to
set up [a]{.mark}]{.underline}** large and **[well-equipped [machine
shop]{.mark} and populate it [with]{.mark} a team of highly
[skilled]{.mark} and extremely devoted
[scientists]{.mark}]{.underline}**, technicians, machinists, and
managers. **[These [people would have to be assembled]{.mark} and
retained]{.underline}** for the monumental task **[[while
generating]{.mark} no consequential [suspicions]{.mark}]{.underline}**
among friends, family, or police about their sudden and lengthy absence
**[from normal pursuits [back home]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Throughout,
the process of fabricating a nuclear weapon would require that
international and local security services be kept perpetually in the
dark, and that no curious locals, including criminal gangs, get wind of
the project as they observe the constant coming and going of outside
technicians over the months or even years it would take to pull off.

Physicists who have studied the issue conclude that fabricating a
nuclear weapon "could hardly be accomplished by a subnational group"
because of "the difficulty of acquiring the necessary expertise, the
technical requirements (which in several fields verge on the
unfeasible), the lack of available materials and the lack of experience
in working with these." Others stress the "daunting problems associated
with material purity, machining, and a host of other issues," and
conclude that the notion that a terrorist group could fabricate an
atomic bomb or device "is far-fetched at best."

**[Finally, [the]{.mark} resulting [weapon]{.mark}, likely weighing a
ton or more, [would have to be moved]{.mark} to a target site in a
manner that did not arouse suspicion.]{.underline}** Then a skilled crew
would have to set off the improvised and untested nuclear device, hoping
that the machine shop work has been perfect, that there were no
significant shakeups in the treacherous process of transportation, and
that the device, after all the effort, isn't a dud.

**[[The financial costs]{.mark} of such an extensive operation
[could]{.mark} easily [become monumental]{.mark}]{.underline}**:
expensive equipment to buy, smuggle, and set up and people to pay---or
pay off. Any **[[criminals]{.mark} competent and capable enough to be
effective allies in the project [would]{.mark} likely [discover]{.mark}
boundless [opportunities for extortion]{.mark} and be psychologically
equipped]{.underline}** by their profession to exploit them.

Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the designated "mastermind" behind the 9/11
attacks, reportedly said that al Qaeda's atom bomb efforts never went
beyond searching the Internet. Even so, that raises the popular notion
that the Internet can be effective in providing operational information.
However, that belief seems to be severely flawed. Researcher Anne
Stenersen finds that the Internet is filled with misinformation and
error and with materials hastily assembled and "randomly put together,"
containing information that is often "far-fetched" or "utter nonsense."

Some members of al Qaeda may have dreamed about getting nuclear

weapons. The only terrorist group to actually indulge in such dreams has
been the Japanese millennial group Aum Shinrikyo. However, its
experience can scarcely be much of an inspiration to other terrorist
groups. Aum Shinrikyo was not under siege or even under close watch, and
it had some 300 scientists in its employ, an estimated budget of \$1
billion, and a remote and secluded haven in which to set up shop. After
making dozens of mistakes in judgment, planning, and execution in a
quest for nuclear weapons, it abandoned its efforts.

The rise of ISIS in 2014 does not alter these conclusions. The vicious
group is certainly a danger to the people under its control and to
fellow Muslims and neighboring Christians. It is actually more
visible---that is, easier to find---than al Qaeda in that it seeks to
hold and govern physical territory, a task that is increasingly
difficult in a hostile world. In the process, it is unlikely to be able
to amass the finances, the skills, and the serenity to go atomic.

**[The notion that terrorists could come up with a nuclear weapon seems
remote.]{.underline}** As with nuclear proliferation to countries, there
may be reason for concern, or at least for interest and watchfulness.
**[But [alarm]{.mark} and hysteria [are hardly called
for]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[Remember how the London Olympics were supposedly left vulnerable to
terrorists]{.underline}** after the security firm hired for the games
admitted that it couldn\'t supply enough manpower? This \"humiliating
shambles\" forced the British government to call in 3,500 security
personnel of its own, and led GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney to
utter some tactless remarks about Britain\'s alleged mismanagement
during his official \"Foot-in-Mouth\" foreign tour last month. **[Well,
surprise, surprise]{.underline}**. **[Not only was there no terrorist
attack]{.underline}**, the Games themselves came off rather well. There
were the inevitable minor glitches, of course, but no disasters and some
quite impressive organizational achievements. And of course, athletes
from around the world delivered inspiring, impressive, heroic, and
sometimes disappointing performances, which is what the Games are all
about. Two lessons might be drawn from this event. The first is that the
head-long rush to privatize everything \-- including the provision of
security \-- has some obvious downsides. When markets and private firms
fail, it is the state that has to come to the rescue. It was true after
the 2007-08 financial crisis, it\'s true in the ongoing euro-mess, and
it was true in the Olympics. Bear that in mind when Romney and new VP
nominee Paul Ryan tout the virtues of shrinking government, especially
the need to privatize Social Security and Medicare. The second lesson is
that **[we continue to over-react to the \"terrorist
threat.\"]{.underline}** **[Here I recommend you read John Mueller and
Mark G. Stewart\'s The Terrorism Delusion]{.underline}**: America\'s
Overwrought Response to September 11, in the latest issue of
International Security. **[Mueller and Stewart analyze 50 cases of
supposed \"Islamic terrorist plots\"]{.underline}** against the United
States, **[and show how virtually all of the perpetrators
were]{.underline}** (in their words) **[\"incompetent, ineffective,
unintelligent, idiotic, ignorant, unorganized, misguided, muddled,
amateurish, dopey, unrealistic, moronic, irrational and
foolish.\"]{.underline}** **[They quote]{.underline}** former Glenn
Carle, **[former deputy national intelligence]{.underline}** officer for
transnational threats saying \"**[we must see jihadists for the small,
lethal, disjointed and miserable opponents that they are,\" noting
further that al Qaeda\'s \"capabilities are far inferior to its
desires]{.underline}**.\" Further, Mueller and Stewart estimate that
expenditures on domestic homeland security (i.e., not counting the wars
in Iraq or Afghanistan) have increased by more than \$1 trillion since
9/11, even though **[the annual risk of dying in a domestic terrorist
attack is about 1 in 3.5 million]{.underline}**. Using conservative
assumptions and conventional risk-assessment methodology, they estimate
that for these expenditures to be cost-effective \"they would have had
to deter, prevent, foil or protect against 333 very large attacks that
would otherwise have been successful every year.\" Finally, they worry
that this exaggerated sense of danger has now been \"internalized\":
even when politicians and \"terrorism experts\" aren\'t hyping the
danger, the public still sees the threat as large and imminent. As they
conclude: \... Americans seems to have internalized their anxiety about
terrorism, and politicians and policymakers have come to believe that
they can defy it only at their own peril.  Concern about appearing to be
soft on terrorism has replaced concern about seeming to be soft on
communism, a phenomenon that lasted far longer than the dramatic that
generated it \... This extraordinarily exaggerated and essentially
delusional response may prove to be perpetual.\" Which is another way of
saying that **[you should be prepared to keep standing in those pleasant
and efficient TSA lines for the rest of your life]{.underline}**, and to
keep paying for far-flung foreign interventions designed to \"root out\"
those nasty jihadis.

Finally, **[the ability of terrorists to strike]{.underline}** the
American homeland **[has been blown out of]{.underline}** all
**[proportion]{.underline}**. In the nine years since 9/11,
**[government officials and terrorist experts have issued countless

American soil **[is probable]{.underline}**---even imminent. **[But this
is simply not the case]{.underline}**.3 **[The only attempts we have

from Amsterdam to Detroit in December 2009. So, **[we do have a

Though torture advocates have touted the "successes" from the CIA using
abusive interrogation after 9/11, the [Senate intelligence
committee]{.underline} report on CIA interrogation and detention [shows
that the tactics were much less effective than the CIA
claimed]{.underline}, [and did not result in unique information that
stopped attacks and saved

Terrorist Groups use Torture. Why Shouldn\'t the United States? Humane
treatment of prisoners and detainees is a fundamental part of American
ideals and values. [Abandoning these values to sink to the level of
terrorist groups would diminish U.S. standing in the world, and reduce
American influence on human rights, military, and counterterrorism
issues]{.underline}. As 42 retired Generals and Admirals wrote,
"[Torture violates our core values as a nation. Our greatest strength is
our commitment to the rule of law]{.underline} and to the principles
embedded in our Constitution. Our servicemen and women need to know that
our leaders do not condone torture of any
kind."[\[4\]](http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/resource/letter-retired-military-leaders-presidential-candidates)
[Torture provides no strategic advantage, and abuses by the United
States provide enemies with a rallying point around which to recruit new
followers]{.underline}. During the Iraq War, the [primary reason for
foreign fighters to come fight U.S. troops was the "perceived U.S.
abuses of and lack of due process for detainees at Abu Ghraib and
Guantanamo
Bay]{.underline}."[\[5\]](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06KUWAIT913_a.html)
Shouldn't we do anything to stop terrorist attacks, including using
torture? As noted above, effective interrogation does not involve
torture or abuse. [Getting accurate information from detainees is the
most certain way to disrupt plots and stop attacks]{.underline}. The
often-cited "ticking time bomb" situation is no exception, and resorting
to torture in these cases causes "the abuse \[to\] spread like wildfire,
and every captured prisoner \[becomes\] the key to defusing a potential
ticking time bomb ... the rare exception fast becoming the rule,"
according to former U.S. Marine Corps Commandant General Charles C.
Krulak and former U.S. CENTCOM Commander General Joseph P.

This not only worries human rights groups, but it also suggests that he
has taken no account of the US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's
Study of the CIA's detention and interrogation activity from
2001--2009,4 on which he must surely have been briefed. **[This report
concluded]{.underline}** (as did the CIA) **[that torturing prisoners
was not an effective]{.underline}** **[means of obtaining intelligence
or cooperation]{.underline}**. It describes Orwellian 'enhanced
interrogation' techniques including **[slapping, walling, stress
positioning, cramped confinement, sleep deprivation, confinement with
insects, waterboarding, sexual humiliation, forcible high-volume IV
injections, extreme temperatures, and the rectal infusion of puréed
food]{.underline}**. These methods have since been defined as torture by
the European Court of Human Rights.5 **[Interrogation by torture relies
on an assumption that fear, stress, and pain 'break' suspects into
delivering useful information]{.underline}**. It's a view replayed in
film and TV, where torture is a chilling plot device driving dramatic
revelation of truth, and where the end justifies the means. Yet, aside
from the overpowering moral, ethical, and legal arguments against it,
does torture work? Shane **[O'Mara,]{.underline}** Professor of
Experimental Brain Research at Trinity College, Dublin, reviews
available evidence on torture, interrogation, and brain function under
stress.6 **[Torture may get people to do things they don't want to
do]{.underline}**, **[but this does not mean it extracts real
information]{.underline}**. He cites extensive evidence that **[stress,
fear, and pain undermine the brain's executive functions, including
recall and cognition, making memory fallible, and pushing individuals
into confabulation that they may actually believe.]{.underline}**
Memories are not recorded chronologically; they are fragile, subject to
revision and loss with time, suggestion, and new information. Memory
reconstructs; it does not reproduce. **[O'Mara describes evidence that
punitive behaviour encourages lies, not truth]{.underline}**. **[Truth
requires cooperation]{.underline}**, which does not result from aversive
therapy and violation of social norms. Stress modifies pain perception.7
The experience of pain is unpredictable and non-linear. Pain management
is a learned technique, and individuals withstand pain to a far greater
degree than they, or interrogators, anticipate. He suggests, chillingly,
that **[there is probably no technique for creating pain that will
induce a well-prepared individual to reveal information before going
into shock or a dissociative state]{.underline}**. **[Torture makes
confession more likely, but such confessions are
unreliable:]{.underline}** **[false confessions are easy to
elicit]{.underline}**.8 **[Men tortured in Turkey in 2013]{.underline}**
**[describe]{.underline}** **[giving]{.underline}** interrogators
**[random names to make it stop]{.underline}**. Those named were also
arrested, and tortured for more names.9 O'Mara suggests that people are
more likely to reveal genuine memory if actively listened to, as people
are wired to want to describe motivation and experience. He refers to
p**[olice interviews in which most suspects talked]{.underline}**10 and
**[describes questioning strategies that increase
truthfulness]{.underline}**, such as developing rapport, asking about
events in reverse order, adding irrelevant questions, and maintaining
eye contact. He calls for appropriate training of interrogators, based
on evidence as well as ethics. Law enforcers may not feel like being
nice to suspects, but, if doing so yields useful information and does
not compromise their morality, it surely makes sense. His book ends with
discussion of the enduring psychological toll of torture on torturers
themselves. **[The CIA's enhanced interrogation programme was, by its
own admission, ineffective, morally catastrophic, and founded on
fiction]{.underline}**. CIA operatives admitted they based their
approach on Jack Bauer, a character in 24 for whom torture generally
saves the day. The Senate report is dark but essential reading for a
president claiming moral authority in the 'war against terror'.4 Wanting
something to be true doesn't make it so. As O'Mara says, **[using
torture to obtain information is the equivalent of evolving a cure for
leukaemia out of your own inner consciousness]{.underline}**. Mr Trump
should take note.

insurgency both because joining increases their chances for
survival]{.underline} (Kalyvas & Kocher, 2007) [and because insurgent
groups offer opportunities for organized opposition to future repressive

generates can also be expected to be ineffective for reducing killings
perpetrated by insurgents. [Information-starved counterinsurgents often
torture individuals who have little or no knowledge of the insurgency,
which can lead to poorly targeted repression and an insurgent
backlash]{.underline}.3 In order to stop their suffering, tortured

[The CIA misled both Congress and the White House on the effectiveness
of its interrogation techniques In order to show]{.underline} the White
House, the National Security Council, the Department of Justice, the CIA
Office of Inspector General, Congress, and the public [that the
"enhanced" interrogation techniques were an effective means of obtaining
accurate information or gaining detainees cooperation]{.underline}, [the
CIA pointed to specific examples of terrorist plots that were "thwarted"
and specific terrorists who were captured. But the agency's
justifications were based on inaccurate claims]{.underline}. The [Senate
committee reviewed 20 examples of counterterrorism successes used by the
CIA and found all to be false in some respect]{.underline}. "In some
cases[, there was no relationship between the cited counterterrorism
success and any information provided by detainees]{.underline} during or
after the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques." In the
remaining cases, the CIA claimed erroneously that specific and otherwise
unavailable information was obtained from a detainee "as a result" of
CIA techniques, when [in reality the information was either a
corroboration of knowledge already known]{.underline} (meaning it was
not "otherwise unavailable") [or it was acquired from the detainee
before the enhanced interrogation methods were even used]{.underline}.
Plus, according to CIA records, seven of the the 39 detainees known to
have been subjected to these techniques produced no intelligence while
in custody. Multiple detainees fabricated information, giving the CIA
faulty intelligence. This fabricated information was represented as
critical intelligence to the CIA, and included terrorist threats that
the agency identified as its highest priorities. "[Some of the plots
that the CIA claimed to have 'disrupted' as a result of the CIA's
enhanced interrogation techniques were assessed by intelligence and law
enforcement officials as being infeasible or ideas that were never
operationalized]{.underline}," concluded the report. But in March 2008,
Bush vetoed the Intelligence Authorization Bill, which would have
effectively banned techniques like waterboarding by applying the
standards in the U.S. Army Field Manual to the entire government. The
president justified his decision in a radio broadcast, repeating CIA
claims that the interrogation program supplied intelligence that foiled
specific terrorist plots. And the House of Representatives failed to
override his veto. Early in his presidency, Barack Obama issued
executive order 13491, requiring that manual to be applied to the entire
government, banning the use of enhanced interrogation techniques.

The [CIA leaked classified documents to journalists, including
inaccurate information on the effectiveness of the enhanced
interrogation techniques]{.underline} "The CIA's Office of Public
Affairs and [senior CIA officials coordinated to share classified

Program to select members of the media [to counter public criticism,
shape public opinion, and avoid potential congressional action to
restrict the CIA's detention and interrogation authorities]{.underline}
and budget," read the report. A memo the deputy director of the CIA's
Counterterrorism Center wrote to a colleague before a media interview in
2005 illustrates just how concerted an effort this was. The director
noted that "we either get out and sell, or we get hammered, which has
implications beyond the media. \[C\]ongress reads it, cuts our
authorities, messes up our budget...we either put out our story our we
get eaten. \[T\]here is no middle ground." For context, this detention
and interrogation program cost \$300 million, excluding personnel costs.
These hundreds of millions of dollars went to the construction and
maintaining of detention facilities, including two that were never used
partly because of political concerns voiced by the host country. The CIA
also provided millions of dollars in cash payments to foreign
governments to encourage them to secretly host these facilities.

In short, **[such debates, such exhortations to \'keep an open mind\',
should be the sign for every authentic liberal that the terrorists are
winning]{.underline}**. And, in a way, essays like Alter\'s, **[which do
not advocate torture outright, simply introduce it as a legitimate topic
of debate, are even more dangerous than an explicit endorsement of
torture]{.underline}**: **[while for the moment, at least- an explicit
endorsement would be too shocking and therefore rejected,]{.underline}**
**[the mere introduction of torture as a legitimate topic allows us to
entertain the idea while retaining a pure conscience]{.underline}**
(\'Of course I\'m against torture- whom does it hurt if we simply
discuss it!\'). **[Such legitimization of torture as a topic of debate
changes the background of ideological presuppositions and options much
more radically than its outright advocacy:]{.underline}** **[it changes
the entire field while, without this change, outright advocacy remains
an idiosyncratic view.]{.underline}** The problem here is that of
fundamental ethical presuppositions: **[of course you can legitimize
torture in terms of short-term gain (saving hundreds of
lives)-]{.underline}** **[but what about the long-term consequences for
our symbolic universe]{.underline}**? **[Where do we stop? Why not
torture hardened criminals, a parent who kidnaps his child from a
divorced spouse \... ?]{.underline}** The idea that, **[once we let the
genic out of the bottle, torture can be kept at a \'reasonable\'level is
the worst liberal illusion]{.underline}**- **[if for no other reason
than that the \'ticking clock\' example is deceptive: for the most part,
torture is not done in order to resolve a \'ticking-dock\' situation,
but for completely different reasons]{.underline}** (to punish or break
down the enemy psychologically, to terrorize the population to be
subdued, and so on). **[Any consistent ethical stance must completely
reject such pragmatic-utilitarian reasoning]{.underline}**. Moreover, I
am again tempted to conduct a simple mental experiment: let us imagine
an Arab newspaper making the case for the torture of American
prisoners - and the explosion of comments about fundamentalist barbarism
and disrespect for human rights this would provoke! Of course, we should
be fully aware of how our very sensitivity to torture - that is, the
idea that torture is against the dignity of a human being as such - grew
out of the ideology of modern capitalism itself: in short, the critique
of capitalism is a result of capitalism\'s own ideological dynamics, not
of our measuring it according to some external standard.

**[The good news for Trump is that Yoo doesn't express any concerns

his qualms about Trump's domestic actions are fairly mild. Yoo feels
that Trump can't pull us out of NAFTA, because that was enacted by
Congress, and he can't put a tariff on Mexican imports by himself. But
he does think Trump can legally halt immigration from any countries he
wants, although he believes Trump should be sure no one talks about it
in public as a "Muslim ban." **[In the end, Yoo's main quarrel with
Trump is that Yoo thinks presidents can go totally hog-wild in foreign
policy but should cooperate with Congress domestically]{.underline}**

Something important happened earlier this month on Capitol Hill. **[By a
huge bipartisan majority\--78 to 21\--the Senate repudiated torture and
took action to make sure it never becomes U.S. policy again. The vote
was on a measure applying the military\'s interrogation rules to all
government actors]{.underline}**. **[This means the CIA will be
prohibited by law]{.underline}** \-- not just by President Barack
Obama\'s 2009 executive order \-- **[from engaging in]{.underline}**
what it once called \"**[enhanced interrogation
techniques]{.underline}**,\" but what, thanks to the Senate Intelligence
Committee report released last December, everyone else now understands
was torture. **[In a time of partisan gridlock, the breadth of support
for this measure is striking]{.underline}**. **[Despite how contentious
an issue torture has been]{.underline}**, **[more than three-quarters of
the Senate]{.underline}** \-- liberals, centrists, and conservatives
**[\-- voted to repudiate the practice]{.underline}**. Fewer than 1 in 5
amendments voted on in the last three Congresses \-- and only 13 percent
in this one\--garnered such widespread support. **[Republican and
Democratic leaders of the armed services, intelligence, foreign affairs,
homeland security, and judiciary committees all backed
it.]{.underline}** **[That\'s a big step towards re-establishing the
bi-partisan consensus that existed]{.underline}** when President Reagan
championed the United Nations Convention Against Torture. It\'s been a
long road back. After 9/11, officials charged with governing a
traumatized nation authorized torture and other cruelty. Fear and a
desire for revenge left policymakers and the public vulnerable to a
collective fantasy that \"taking the gloves off\" could save us. On
network television, the hit show 24 proffered the comforting fiction
that security depends on heroes like Jack Bauer willing to do \"whatever
it takes.\" Torture violated our laws and betrayed our ideals. And, as
the Senate report showed, the fantasy that it kept us safe was just
that\--a fantasy. Torture didn\'t disrupt terrorist plots. On the
contrary, it produced bogus information that hindered investigations.
This is what retired military leaders and veteran interrogators have
been saying for years. But the more torture proponents were challenged,
the more vigorously they pushed back. First they claimed that torture
wasn\'t really \"torture.\" When the details of abuse became public and
rendered that claim transparently false, they claimed torture
\"worked.\" In the face of this PR onslaught\--and with no public
accounting\--polls found that many Americans continued to support
torture precisely because they believed it kept them safe. Leaders with
honor challenge people to be their best selves. Instead of asking
Americans to have the courage of our ideals and faith in our
institutions, officials asked us to be afraid. **[Fortunately, some
leaders stood up. Many inside government sought to stop torture,
combating it from within or blowing the whistle.]{.underline}** When
General David Petraeus learned that troops under his command were
accepting of torture, he publicly reminded them in that it is wrong and
aids the enemy. After Abu Ghraib, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., spearheaded
the Detainee Treatment Act. **[On his second day in office, President
Obama banned torture by executive order.]{.underline}** Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., fought to release the findings of her committee\'s
investigation in the face of attacks from the CIA.

**[More than a decade ago, we began building a coalition of
distinguished military leaders to challenge the damaging misconception
that torture keeps us safe.]{.underline}** Together, we changed the
debate---and U.S. policy---on torture. President Obama said these
generals and admirals "made an extraordinary impression" on him. That's
why they were in the Oval Office when he signed his 2009 executive order
banning torture. It was a major victory for human rights, shutting the
door on torture. But we knew that without a public accounting of
post-9/11 abuses, the temptation to reopen that door would persist. So
we set our sights on the classified Senate intelligence committee's
report on CIA torture. **[In 2014]{.underline}**, we led **[a successful
effort to secure public release of the report's executive summary, which
proved that torture was not only more brutal and more prevalent than
Americans had been led to believe, but was utterly ineffective as an
intelligence technique. In 2015, we used the momentum generated by the
report's release to push for a law that would lock the door to
torture.]{.underline}** Our allies Senators John McCain and Dianne
Feinstein introduced a bill that would ban so-called "enhanced
interrogation" techniques and preclude the kind of loophole lawyering
that government officials had exploited to authorize torture. Because

was important not only for the bill to pass, but for it to attract wide,

**[in a Congress notorious for partisan gridlock.]{.underline}**
Senators McCain and Feinstein credited our work, and President Obama

amendment reaffirms President Barack Obama's prohibition of
interrogation techniques such as waterboarding and sleep deprivation,

### Plan k2 Trump/base

#### Trump rallies around torture and the public supports him on it

**Rensch \'16** (Adam Theron-Lee Rensch, 7-8-2016, \"The appeal of
torture: what I learned from teaching a class on terrorism\",
Guardian,<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/08/torture-terrorism-college-class>)
\[HS\]

Standing before a crowd in my home state of Ohio in late June, [Trump
casually asked his supporters what they thought of waterboarding. "I
like it a lot," he said]{.underline}, as though he were commenting on an
appetizer.["I don't think it's tough enough."]{.underline} As much as I
am horrified by Trump's words, I am not surprised. [Recent
surveys](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-torture-exclusive-idUSKCN0WW0Y3)[ have
shown that torture has the support of roughly two-thirds of the US
population: 82% of Republicans and 53% of Democrats believe it is
justified at least some of the time. Trump, ever the opportunist, is
simply tapping into a sentiment that few want to believe
exists.]{.underline} And exist it does. I experienced this sentiment
firsthand last semester, while teaching two writing courses at the
University of Illinois at Chicago -- courses designed around the topic
"terrorism and everyday life". I chose it because terrorism, as the
title of the class was meant to suggest, is a fundamental part of daily
life in the 21st century. No longer is it something that encroaches upon
us from "outside", as the planes did on 9/11. [Daily life is now
structured around the possibility of attacks, with news headlines about
bombings and shootings flashing across our electronic devices on a
routine schedule.]{.underline}

#### Trump opposes the plan -- terrorists perceive the US as weak

by American troop]{.underline}s, said at a campaign rally, "[We have to
fight fire with fire",]{.underline} after referencing the penchant for
beheadings by Isis. The presumptive Republican nominee claimed
that [while the terrorist group committed a range of atrocities
including beheadings and drowning prisoners, the US was afraid to even
use waterboarding. In Trump's opinion, this left Isis believing that the
US was weak and it needs to "fight so viciously and violently" to combat
the threat]{.underline}. Trump also renewed his praise of waterboarding,
which was banned by the Bush administration in 2006 as both potentially
illegal and ineffective. "[What do you think about waterboarding?" Trump
asked the crowd. They cheered as he gave his answer: "I like it a lot. I
don't think it's tough enough]{.underline}." His comments came just
hours after a [terrorist attack on the Istanbul
airport](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/28/turkey-airport-explosions-ataturak-istanbul)that
caused dozens of deaths. Prior to taking the stage, Trump's campaign
issued a measured statement on the attack: "Our prayers are with the
families of those killed and injured in Istanbul. The whole world is
stunned and horrified." At his Ohio rally, he said: "[There is something
going on that's really, really bad."]{.underline}

As Donald Trump's administration reviews U.S. policies on the detainment
and interrogation of terrorism suspects, [the public is divided over
whether it is ever acceptable for the country to use torture in
anti-terror efforts]{.underline}. Overall, 48% say there are some

anti-terrorism efforts; about as many (49%) say there are no
circumstances under which the use of torture is acceptable.
[Trump]{.underline} has said he personally [believes torture
works]{.underline}, but that he will confer with his Cabinet before
considering any changes to U.S. policy. The use of torture by the
military and all other government agencies is currently banned under
U.S. law. The national survey of 4,265 adults conducted just before the
presidential election (Oct. 25-Nov. 8) on Pew Research Center's

and political differences in views of torture. [About seven-in-ten
Republicans]{.underline} and Republican-leaning independents (71%) [say
there are some circumstances where it is acceptable for the U.S. to use
torture]{.underline}. By contrast, [67% of Democrats]{.underline} and
Democratic-leaning independents [say there are no circumstances under
which this is acceptable]{.underline}. Within both parties there are
differences in views by ideology: [Conservative Republicans are 18
percentage points more likely than moderate and liberal Republicans to
say there are circumstances where it is acceptable for the U.S. to use
torture]{.underline} in anti-terrorism efforts (79% vs. 61%); [among
Democrats, liberals are 11 points more likely than moderates and
conservatives to say there are no circumstances where the U.S. use of
torture is acceptable]{.underline} (74% vs. 63%).

## T Subs

### Considerable

#### "Substantial" means considerable or to a large degree \-\-- this common meaning is preferable because the word is not a term of art

**Arkush 2** (David, JD Candidate -- Harvard University, "Preserving

Plaintiffs should argue that the term \"substantially prevail\" is not a
term of art because if considered a term of art, resort to Black\'s 7th
produces a definition of \"prevail\" that could be interpreted adversely
to plaintiffs.

and ordinary-usage dictionaries provide FOIA fee claimants with helpful
arguments. [The Supreme Court has already found favorable]{.underline},
temporally relevant [definitions of the word \"substantially\" in
ordinary dictionaries: \"Substantially\" suggests \"considerable\"
or]{.underline} \"[specified to a large degree]{.underline}.\" See
Webster\'s Third New International Dictionary 2280 (1976) (defining
\"substantially\" as \"in a substantial manner\" and \"substantial\" as
\"considerable in amount, value, or worth\" and \"being that specified
to a large degree or in the main\"); see also 17 Oxford English
Dictionary 66-67 (2d ed. 1989) (\"substantial\": \"relating to or
proceeding from the essence of a thing; essential\"; \"of ample or
considerable amount, quantity or dimensions\").

#### Substantial means "of considerable amount" -- not some contrived percentage

**Prost 4** (Judge -- United States Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit, "Committee For Fairly Traded Venezuelan Cement v. United
States", 6-18,
http://www.ll.georgetown.edu/federal/judicial/fed/opinions/04opinions/04-1016.html)

The URAA and the SAA neither amend nor refine the language of
§ 1677(4)(C).  In fact, they merely suggest, without disqualifying other
alternatives, a "clearly higher/substantial proportion" approach. 
Indeed, the SAA specifically mentions that no "precise mathematical
formula" or "'benchmark' proportion" is to be used for a dumping
concentration analysis.  SAA at 860 (citations omitted); see also Venez.
Cement, 279 F. Supp. 2d at 1329-30.  Furthermore, as the Court of
International Trade noted, the SAA emphasizes that the Commission
retains the discretion to determine concentration of imports on a
"case-by-case basis."  SAA at 860.  Finally, [the definition of the word
"substantial" undercuts the]{.underline} CFTVC's [argument.  The word
"substantial" generally means "considerable in amount,]{.underline}
value or worth."  Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2280
(1993).  [**It does not imply a specific number or cut-off.  What** may
be substantial in one situation may not be in another
situation.]{.underline}  The very breadth of the term "substantial"
undercuts the CFTVC's argument that Congress spoke clearly in
establishing a standard for the Commission's regional antidumping and
countervailing duty analyses.  It therefore supports the conclusion that
the Commission is owed deference in its interpretation of "substantial
proportion."  The Commission clearly embarked on its analysis having
been given considerable leeway to interpret a particularly broad term.

### Certainty

#### "Substantial" requires a certain mandate

**Words and Phrases 64** (40W&P 759)

**[The words]{.underline}**\" outward, open, actual, visible,
**[substantial]{.underline}**, and exclusive,\" in connection with a
change of possession, mean substantially the same thing. They **[mean
not concealed]{.underline}**; not hidden; exposed to view; free from
concealment, dissimulation, reserve, or disguise; in full existence;
[**denoting that which not merely can be, but is opposed to
potential**,]{.underline} apparent, constructive, and imaginary;
veritable; genuine; **[certain: absolute: real at present
time]{.underline}**, as a matter of fact, not merely nominal; opposed to
form; actually existing; true; not including, admitting, or pertaining
to any others; undivided; sole; opposed to inclusive.

### Reasonability

#### [Reasonability]{.underline} is uniquely applicable to determining whether an aff is substantial

is generally **held to a reasonableness** standard, i.e., would a
**reasonable mind** accept it as adequate to support a
conclusion]{.underline}. E.g., Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S.
197, 229 (1938).

### Qualitative good

#### Substantial is qualitative not quantitative - their interpretation is arbitrary

H. Beau **Baez 6**, Assistant Professor of Law, Liberty University
School of Law, Seattle University Law Review Spring, 2006 29 Seattle
Univ. L. R. 581

The Supreme Court has interpreted the Commerce Clause to prohibit state
actions that discriminate against or unduly burden interstate commerce
as part of its Negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence. n83 A state\'s
attempt to tax out-of-state companies may be seen as such a burden if,
among other things, n84 the tax is applied to a company that does not
have \"substantial nexus\" with the taxing state. n85 Expressly
rejecting a facts-and-circumstances test, which would have weighed
various factors, the Quill Court instead created a simple bright-line
test measured by physical presence in a state. n86 The Quill Court held
that the physical presence of a company in the taxing state satisfies
the Commerce Clause substantial nexus test. n87 [Unfortunately, lower
courts have found some ambiguity]{.underline} in Quill, [and have
struggled to apply the bright-line to the facts of real
cases]{.underline}. n88¶ Admittedly, part of [the confusion lies in the
name given to the legal requirement by the Quill Court: \"substantial
nexus.\" The word \"substantial\" connotes weighing of
factors]{.underline}, yet the Court attached a bright-line test to the
legal phrase \"substantial nexus.\" Thus, we have a legal requirement
that requires a company to have substantial nexus with a state before it
can be subjected to a state\'s regulatory use tax authority, but
\[\*596\] that legal requirement is determined by a bright-line physical
presence test.¶ [This lack of clarity by the Court is not new. Before
Quill, the Court referred to the \"substantial nexus\" n89 requirement
alternatively as \"sufficient nexus,\" n90 \"sufficiently connected,\"
n91 \"requisite nexus,\" n92 \"necessary basis,\" n93 \"sufficient
relation,\" n94 \"necessary nexus,\" n95 \"adequate nexus,\" n96
\"obvious nexus,\" n97 \"clear and sufficient nexus]{.underline},\" n98
and Chief Justice Rehnquist\'s colorful phrase \"nexus aplenty.\" n99
However, even after Quill \-- the seminal nexus case of the last
twenty-five years \-- [the Court has continued describing the
\"substantial nexus\" requirement in different ways]{.underline}, such
as \"adequate nexus,\" n100 \"sufficient nexus,\" n101 \"Commerce Clause
nexus,\" n102 \"nexus aplenty\" n103 (this phrase is apparently just too
good for the Justices to let go), and, in one of its most recent state
tax cases, \"minimal connection.\" n104 These interchangeable phrases
suggest that the phrase \"substantial nexus\" in Quill is the Court\'s
shorthand for Commerce Clause nexus \-- any substantive meaning of the
phrase must be found in the case law and not in the phrase \"substantial
nexus\" itself. n105¶ The Quill Court likewise lacks clarity when it
describes the due process minimum contacts test: \"due process nexus
analysis requires that we ask whether an individual\'s connections with
a State are substantial enough to legitimate the State\'s exercise of
power over him.\" n106 It is curious that the Court describes the due
process minimum contacts test as requiring substantial contacts; n107 a
threshold that is easily met by most companies doing business across
state lines. Since the Court spent so \[\*597\] much time explaining
that there are two separate nexus tests, it would be odd for the Court
to then define them similarly.¶ [Examining the legal definition of
\"substantial\" provides some light as to what the Court meant by
\"substantial nexus\"]{.underline} in Quill. [Black\'s Law]{.underline}
Dictionary [defines \"substantial\" as \"belonging to substance;
actually existing; real; not seeming or imaginary; not illusive; solid;
true; veritable.\"]{.underline} n108 [This]{.underline} legal
[definition furnishes evidence that \"**substantial\" is defined
qualitatively, not quantitatively.** Webster\'s]{.underline} Dictionary
[also lends support to the qualitative nature of the word by defining
its primary meaning as \"consisting of or relating to
substance]{.underline}; not imaginary or illusory: real, true;
important, essential,\" n109 [while the notion of \"substantial\" as
quantitative is relegated to a secondary meaning]{.underline} of the
word. n110¶ Though the phrase \"substantial nexus\" is amorphous, Quill
does attempt to provide guidance for Commerce Clause nexus by providing
a test that examines qualitative contacts that do and do not create
nexus (i.e., the bright-line physical presence test). Specifically, the
Quill Court eliminates any room for quantitative nexus speculation
because its bright-line test \"firmly establishes the boundaries of
legitimate state authority.\" n111 A \"substantial nexus\" test that
looks primarily at the quantity of contacts ignores both the bright-line
test as well as the Court\'s explicit rejection of \"tests with more
contextual balancing inquiries.\" n112 The Court was aware that it could
have established a facts-and-circumstances test (i.e., a test where the
number of contacts is weighed); however, the Court refused to do so
after extensive discussion of the topic. n113 A brightline test is
\"artificial at its edges . . . \[however\] this artificiality . . . is
more than offset by the benefits of a clear rule.\" n114 If a business
has contacts that fall on one side of the state line they have nexus,
while if their contacts are on the other side of the state line there is
no nexus. This is a simple and clear rule that does not take into
account factors like the number of contacts or the type of contact
(e.g., solicitation, technical support, or training).¶ [Given the
history and context of the phrases used by the Court to describe
Commerce Clause nexus, it is useless to try to discern any substantive
meaning from the phrases \"substantial nexus,\"]{.underline}
\"sufficient nexus,\" or \"nexus aplenty\" themselves. Should state tax
jurisdiction debates be relegated to a tit-for-tat where those that want
to avoid nexus \[\*598\] use the phrase \"substantial nexus\" while
those wanting to create nexus rely on the phrases \"sufficient nexus\"
or \"minimal contacts?\" **[Only modern-day sophists n115 would
seriously contend that such debate would be useful.]{.underline}** n116
In the end it is case law that animates the concept of Commerce Clause
nexus; out-of-context discussions

#### Percentage definitions are unpredictable -- don't assign in advance

**Viscasillas 4** -- professor at the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid
(Pilar, "Contracts for the Sale of Goods to Be Manufactured or Produced
and Mixed Contracts (Article 3 CISG)", CISG Advisory Council Opinion No.

2.8. Legal writers who follow the economic value criterion have
generally quantified the term \"substantial part\" by comparing Article
3(1) CISG (substantial) with Article 3(2) CISG (preponderant):
substantial being less than preponderant. In this way, [legal writers
have used the following percentages to quantify substantial:
15%]{.underline},\[14\] [between 40% and 50%]{.underline},\[15\] [or
more generally 50]{.underline}%.\[16\] At the same time, other authors,
although they have not fixed any numbers in regard to the quantification
of the term \"substantial\" have declared that \"preponderant\" means
\"considerably more than 50% of the price\" or \"clearly in excess of
50%\".\[17\] Thus it seems that for the latter authors, the
quantification of the term \"substantial\" is placed above the 50%
figure. Also, some Courts have followed this approach.\[18\]

2.9. [To consider a fixed percentage might be arbitrary due to the fact
that the particularities of each case ought to be taken into account;
that the scholars are in disagreement; and that the origin of those
figures is not clear]{.underline}.\[19\]

[Therefore,]{.underline} [it does not seem to be advisable to quantify
the word \"substantial\" a priori in percentages. A case-by-case
analysis is preferable and thus it should be determined on the basis of
an overall assessment]{.underline}.

### Annual baseline bad

#### Reject [annual]{.underline} baselines -- arms sales are [cyclical]{.underline} and fluctuate constantly

**Willardson, 13** - PhD (Doctor of Philosophy) thesis, University of
Iowa (Spencer, \"Under the influence Of arms: the foreign policy causes
and consequences of arms transfers.\"
<https://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4789&context=etd>

Figure 3.4 illustrates a number of key issues. The pattern indicated by
this graph is interesting in its depiction of the relative share of the
U.S. and Russia of the world arms market. The first of these issues is
the degree to which the U.S. and Russia dominate the world arms transfer
market. The trend lines for the U.S. and Russian average percentage of
arms exports show that, on average, the U.S. and Russia have accounted
for nearly 70 percent of the value of arms transfers from 1950 through
2010. A second issue is that **[the underlying cyclical nature of the
market means]{.underline}** that Russian and **[U.S. arms sales
fluctuate from year to year,]{.underline}** **[as does the size of the
arms market.]{.underline}** When one of these states makes a number of
sales in a year, the share of the other state will drop even if its
sales remains steady from the prior year.

Debunking Key Assumptions

Though impressive in ambition, expectation, and design, the new CAT
policy is premised on a number of underlying assumptions that need to be
examined. First, there are those that believe that the implementation of
the new CAT policy should lead to a linear increase in annual arms
exports. As Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International
Security Andrea Thompson recently projected about the level of arms
exports for 2019, "the CAT policy will have been in place, we'll have
gained those efficiencies and feedback from industry and partners ... so
I would anticipate that would increase sales, one would think."

However, **[the annual worth of arms exports tends to be
uneven]{.underline}** and dependent on what clients are seeking to buy.
**[The sale of major]{.underline}** and expensive **[weapon
systems]{.underline}**, such as warplanes, **[can single-handedly boost
the worth of arms exports for any given year. The highest recorded year
of arms sales was]{.underline}** FY 2012 totaling **[\$69.1 billion, but
this included a single \$29 billion deal]{.underline}** for the sale of
84 F-15s to Saudi Arabia. According to the figures of the Defense
Security Cooperation Agency, in FY 2014 arms exports totaled \$34.2
billion, FY 2015 totaled \$47 billion, FY 2016 totaled \$33.6 billion,
FY 2017 totaled \$41.9 billion, while FY 2018 has so far totaled \$46.9
billion.

**[Large-scale sales]{.underline}** of major weapon systems **[create
capacity limits in consecutive years]{.underline}**. For example, **[the
surge in the sale of advanced fighter jets]{.underline}** to the Gulf
countries during the Obama presidency **[will slow down the future
sale]{.underline}** of these high-priced items **[in]{.underline}** the
**[years to come,]{.underline}** affecting overall totals of annual
sales. Principally, **[the periodic military needs of
clients]{.underline}** are going to **[play a]{.underline}** far
**[large]{.underline}**r **[role in determining]{.underline}** whether
the **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates is going to
increase foreign **[arms sales]{.underline}** in the coming years than
the governmental streamlining of organizations and procedures.

### DCS baseline impossible

#### Official DCS figures are useless

**Perlo-Freeman, 17 -** Dr Sam Perlo-Freeman was the Head of the SIPRI
Project on Military Expenditure in the Arms Transfers and Military
Expenditure Programme. He is currently on leave of absence to work with
the World Peace Foundation where he leads the Global Arms Trade and
Corruption Project. (Samuel, "Just how big is the international arms
trade? (part 2)" 9/25,
<https://sites.tufts.edu/reinventingpeace/2017/09/25/just-how-big-is-the-international-arms-trade-part-2/>

In short, **[the official DCS delivery figures]{.underline}**, like the
authorization figures, **[are]{.underline}** essentially
**[useless]{.underline}** **[for estimating the true level of US arms
exports]{.underline}**. As noted above, **[these figures also exclude
exports of military services]{.underline}**, **[which are]{.underline}**
almost certainly **[a significant amount]{.underline}**: the export of
equipment is frequently accompanied by the provision of long-term
maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services, as well as training in
the use of the equipment, technical assistance, etc. **[But there is no
good way to estimate this]{.underline}**.\[4\]

In other words, **[nobody knows the actual level of arms exports by the
world's number one exporter]{.underline}**. The GAO report, as well as
the annual CRS reports, lament this state of affairs, pointing out that
knowing what arms the US is actually exporting would help both
administration and Congress to assess whether these exports are
supporting or harming US foreign policy goals. But as yet, this has
drawn no response.

#### Official DCS data includes services that go to [the US government]{.underline} -- it can't be measured

**Perlo-Freeman, 17 -** Dr Sam Perlo-Freeman was the Head of the SIPRI
Project on Military Expenditure in the Arms Transfers and Military
Expenditure Programme. He is currently on leave of absence to work with
the World Peace Foundation where he leads the Global Arms Trade and
Corruption Project. (Samuel, "Just how big is the international arms
trade? (part 2)" 9/25,
<https://sites.tufts.edu/reinventingpeace/2017/09/25/just-how-big-is-the-international-arms-trade-part-2/>

The US, which is by any measure the world's largest arms export,
provides highly detailed data on their arms exports, covering orders,
licenses, and deliveries. The problem is, some of this data is really,
really, bad.

US arms sales go through two different channels: Foreign Military Sales
(FMS), which are government-to-government agreements, where the US sells
equipment to a foreign government, and then subcontracts the production
of the equipment to a US arms producer. The second is Direct Commercial
Sales (DCS), where exports are agreed directly between a US company and
the recipient government, requiring a license from the US
government.\[1\]

**[Data on FMS agreements]{.underline}** and deliveries **[are available
annually from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency,
and]{.underline}** as far as we know, **[this data is comprehensive and
reliable, and is regularly revised and updated]{.underline}** as new
information becomes available.

**[The problem comes with DCS. The State Department produces an annual
"Section 655" report each year detailing the value of
authorizations]{.underline}** and deliveries of defense equipment and
services under DCS. The value of authorizations for each country is
broken down into different categories of military equipment and
services, with number of licenses and value in each category for each
country. Data on shipments (deliveries), however, is limited to a total
per country. Up to 2008, the DCS delivery figures are also reported in
the DSCA Fiscal Year Series reports.

**[The CRS does not include data on DCS agreements]{.underline}** and
deliveries in its total for US arms exports, **[as it considers the data
to be incomplete, and as the data is not revised and updated as is the
case for FMS data]{.underline}**. In particular, **[data on DCS
authorizations is of limited value, as once a company has obtained a
license for export with a 4-year validity, it is under no obligation to
report whether or not a contract has resulted from this license, or the
value of any such contract]{.underline}**. **[An even more serious
problem is that they include licenses for deliveries by US companies to
US forces and government agencies stationed overseas]{.underline}**.
**[This gives rise to particularly high figures for countries such as
Japan, South Korea, the UK, Germany, Belgium, Afghanistan and Iraq,
which are host to a large US military presence]{.underline}**. **[This
is especially true for the authorizations for DCS agreements for defense
*services*, which are]{.underline}** frequently **[much larger than
those for defense equipment.]{.underline}** In general, **[there is no
way to distinguish between authorizations for actual exports to foreign
governments]{.underline}**, **[and those for contracts between US
companies and US forces overseas]{.underline}**.

We are interested in deliveries, however, for which separate figures are
provided, at least for defense equipment (articles); **[data for
deliveries of DCS defense services are not available, as no-one collects
this data]{.underline}**.\[2\] Unfortunately, **[this data is
incomplete, as it is based on voluntary reporting by companies at the
point of shipment.]{.underline}** As a result, **[the figures are in
general substantial underestimates of total DCS
deliveries]{.underline}**. Figure 1 shows the value of official figures
for DCS deliveries from 1971 to 2015, from which the highly erratic
nature of these figures is evident.

In particular, there is a huge spike in the figures for 2005, 2006 and
2008. In these years, following pressure from US Congress for better
data, detailed and comprehensive shipment data for DCS was collected by
the US Customs, and presented in the section 655 report. The figures for
these years are each over \$30 billion, compared to a maximum of \$8.9
billion in any other year for which figures are available.

However, as with the figures for authorizations, **[these figures are
greatly inflated by the inclusion of deliveries by private companies to
US forces and government agencies operating overseas]{.underline}**, as
well as actual exports to foreign governments and entities. Indeed, as
with authorizations, the largest recipients of DCS deliveries in 2005,
2006 and 2008, and **[the ones showing the biggest 'spike' in deliveries
for these years, are mostly countries with a significant US troop
presence and/or military bases, such as Japan, Germany, the UK, South
Korea, Kuwait, and]{.underline}** **[Italy]{.underline}**. Thus, these
figures are massive overestimates.\[3\]

#### It's impossible to measure DCS -- the value of licenses doesn't correspond to actual deliveries

**Dhooge 99** -- Assistant Professor of Business Law, University of the
Pacific; B.A., 1980, University of Colorado; J.D., 1983, University of

Columbia Bars (Lucien, "WE ARM THE WORLD: THE IMPLICATIONS OF AMERICAN
PARTICIPATION IN THE GLOBAL ARMAMENTS TRADE, 16 Ariz. J. Int\'l & Comp.
Law 577, Lexis)

However, it is important to note that **[the valuation of direct
commercial sales is an inexact science]{.underline}**. **[The actual
amount of direct commercial sales is practically impossible to ascertain
due to a number of factors]{.underline}**. **[Initially, although the
U.S. Department of State reports the value of export licenses approved
for direct commercial sales, it does not report the value of actual
defense orders placed as a result of those licenses]{.underline}**. 103
Additionally, **[commercial arms transfer licenses are valid for three
years, which causes delays in the reporting of actual
deliveries]{.underline}**. 104 **[Finally, specific information on
direct commercial sales is considered confidential by many private
industry participants and is generally unavailable for public
scrutiny]{.underline}**. 105

### State Department and Commerce

#### DCS is approved by both State and Commerce, depending on the item

**Hays, 16 -** Laurie Hays, an international trade specialist on the
Aerospace Team in the U.S. Department of Commerce's International Trade
Administration ("2016-17 Defense Export Handbook" International Trade
Administration, December,
<https://www.trade.gov/td/otm/assets/aero/DefHB_FULL.pdf>

**[Things to]{.underline}** understand and **[confirm prior to
submitting a DCS bid to a foreign government:]{.underline}**

**[• Confirm the type of export control license needed, based on
jurisdiction:]{.underline}** Export Administration Regulations (**[EAR),
which are regulated by the Department of Commerce, or]{.underline}**
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (**[ITAR), which are regulated
by DOS]{.underline}**.

• Whether any sanctions would preclude a sale (section 126.1 of the
ITAR).

• Identification of penalties that could be imposed if regulations are
not upheld. 3

• Know that with DCS, if the foreign entity withholds payment, a company
has no direct recourse to payment collection from the U.S. government.

ITA primarily assists exporters implementing DCS projects; however the
ITAs Advocacy Center provides advocacy for both DCS and FMS cases
through the Advocacy Center4 . A company can contact a Commercial
Services U.S. Export Assistance Centers (USEACs) in their local area for
support also.

Ultimately, the U.S. Government authorizes both FMS and DCS sales---but
in different ways. For FMS, DSCA and the Department of State (DOS)
review and initiate new FMS cases, based on national security and
foreign policy priorities. The U.S. Government is exporting on behalf of
the U.S. vendor under the authority of the LOA, so the items do not
require an export license. **[Under DCS, USML and dual-use items require
an export license.]{.underline}** **[The contractor must apply to either
the Department of State or the Department of Commerce, depending on
jurisdiction, to obtain an export license]{.underline}**. In either
method (FMS or DCS), the U.S. Government makes a final decision to
authorize a defense export.

#### Both State and Commerce have jurisdiction

**Nichols, 14 --** partner, Covington & Burling LLP (Robert, "DIRECT
COMMERCIAL SALES" 9/30,
https://www.dsca.mil/sites/default/files/final-fms-dcs_30_sep.pdf

Pursuant to the U.S. export control regime, **[DCS transactions must
comply with]{.underline}** the U.S. Government's **[export licensing
requirements. Here]{.underline}**, the U.S. Department of
**[State]{.underline}**, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls
("**[DDTC]{.underline}**"), **[and]{.underline}** **[the U.S. Department
of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security]{.underline}** ("BIS"),
**[exercise primary jurisdiction]{.underline}**.92 Traditionally,
**[DDTC has exercised jurisdiction over transactions involving defense
articles and services]{.underline}**. **[BIS exercises jurisdiction over
transactions involving commercial or "dual-use"]{.underline}** (i.e.,
both commercial and military) **[articles and services.]{.underline}**
**[Both agencies could have jurisdiction over a DCS transaction.
However, as a result of]{.underline}** recent U.S. **[export control
reforms, BIS has acquired increased jurisdiction over certain defense
items]{.underline}**. For example, **[DDTC often licenses the export and
reexport of key end-items]{.underline}** (e.g., fighter aircraft),
**[while BIS authorizes the export]{.underline}** and retransfer **[of
many of the end-items' parts, components, accessories, attachments, and
associated equipment]{.underline}** (e.g., aircraft tires; filters;
brake wear pads; and cockpit-panel knobs, indicators, switches, buttons,
and dials).

With some exceptions, a DDTC license or other approval is required for
the export, reexport, retransfer, or temporary import of a defense
article and service (including technical data). U.S. Government arms
embargoes and other proscriptions bar some foreign countries, including
China, 95 from receiving any defense articles or services (including
technical data) subject to the ITAR. DDTC prohibits the release of any
articles or services (including technical data) subject to the ITAR to
these countries, companies incorporated in these countries, or other
companies owned or controlled by the government or companies of these
countries. DDTC also closely restricts exports to any individual that is
a national of one of these countries, whether that release occurs in the
United States or abroad, absent a license, approval, or exemption.

Meanwhile, BIS oversees transactions involving commercial and dual-use
items, exercising its jurisdiction pursuant to the Export Administration
Regulations ("EAR").96 BIS has broad authority to regulate virtually all
exports from the United States that are not subject to the jurisdiction
of another agency (e.g., DDTC), and to regulate reexports from one
non-U.S. country to another of U.S. items or of non-U.S. products that
contain more than de minimis U.S. content. That said, BIS controls only
a small subset of such exports, based on the sensitivity of the item, as
well as the nature of the end-use and end-user.

#### DCS includes the Commerce Department

DCS Process

**[DCS is]{.underline}** regarded as a more **[flexible]{.underline}**
process, **[as the purchaser consults directly with
industry]{.underline}** about specific products and services it needs.
Foreign customers leverage more negotiating power regarding the type of
contract (fixed price or firm fixed price), how the contract is written,
final delivery requirements, and methods of payment. However, they must
carry more risk and administrative burdens. DCS has the added benefit of
giving customers options to purchase more non-standard systems that are
mission specific, and designed to tackle readiness challenges. In these
cases, the Pentagon does not support these types of mission requirements
in their stockpiles, or in their annual budget.

**[Qualifying for an export license through DCS is based on how a
product or service is categorized. The State Department]{.underline}**'s
Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) **[executes authority in
issuing export licenses to all defense related products and services on
the U.S. Munitions List]{.underline}** (USML), **[pursuant
to]{.underline}** the International Traffic in Arms Regulations
**[(ITAR).]{.underline}** **[The Department of Commerce]{.underline}**'s
Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) **[grants export licenses to more
commercial and "dual-use" defense products and services]{.underline}**
**[on the Commerce Control List]{.underline}** (CCL), pursuant to the
Export Administration Regulations (EAR).

Like the FMS program, DCS advances interoperability between the U.S
military and its allies. Furthermore, foreign countries use FMF funding
to purchase U.S. defense products and systems through both the FMS
program and, on occasion, the DCS process.

**[U.S. defense articles and services]{.underline}** generally **[can be
exported]{.underline}** to foreign entities in two ways---**[by FMS or
DCS. Under FMS, the U.S. government procures defense articles and
services]{.underline}** **[on behalf of the foreign
entity]{.underline}**. Countries approved to participate in this program
may obtain defense articles and services by paying with their own funds
or with funds provided through U.S. government-sponsored assistance
programs. **[While State has overall regulatory responsibility for the
FMS program and approves the export]{.underline}** of defense articles
and services, **[DOD's DSCA directs the execution of the
program]{.underline}**, and the individual military departments
implement the sale and export process. DOD bills foreign entities and
tracks the export of articles and services through its financial
systems. For FMS, an approved Letter of Offer and Acceptance authorizes
the export. **[Under DCS, U.S. companies obtain permanent export
licenses]{.underline}** generally valid **[for 4 years11 from State's
DDTC]{.underline}**, which authorizes the export of defense articles and
services directly to foreign entities. State also licenses defense
articles for temporary export---when the article will be exported for a
period of less than 4 years and will be returned to the United States
without transfer of title.

While most defense articles and services require a license for export,
the ITAR contains numerous exemptions from licensing requirements that
have defined conditions and limitations. For both FMS and DCS, the
actual export of defense articles or services may occur years after the
authorization---or may not take place at all.

#### DCS are government to private sales through the State Department

**Sorenson, 9** - Professor of International Security Studies at the
United States Air Force War College (David, [The Process and Politics of
Defense Acquisition: A Reference Handbook]{.underline}, p. 133-134

The Arms Export Control Act and the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961
created **[the FMS program]{.underline}**, which **[involves
government-to-government weapons and systems sales]{.underline}**. The
Defense Department operates the program on a no-loss, no-profit basis
(this means that sales are not conducted at below U.S. prices, and the
Defense Department does not make a profit on them but instead charges a
3.8 percent fee). The program starts with an official request from the
purchasing country, which the Defense Department coordinates through the
Department of State\'s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. Once
approved, the U.S. government actually contracts for the goods or
services that the recipient country requested. Usually, to facilitate
standardization with U.S. equipment (so that recipient countries can
have interoperability with U.S. equipment in exercises or in allied
combat), the FMS specifies that the particular foreign sales items are
or will be in service with the U.S. military.

**[Direct commercial sales, unlike FMS, are coordinated through the
Office of Trade Controls at the State Department\'s Bureau of
Political-Military Affairs]{.underline}**. In contrast to FMS, once the
State Department has approved, **[DCS allows for direct negotiations
between the international customer and the manufacturer]{.underline}**,
which allows both to avoid the surcharges involved with FMS and allows
for specialized equipment that the international customer requires
without the need for U.S.- equivalent equipment.

It is difficult to compare the value of arms transferred under each
program because contractors participating in DCS are not required to
reveal the value of those items. Arms transfers under FMS are
coordinated between the contractor and the buyer by the Defense Security
Cooperation Agency (DSCA). The DSCA operates on a no-profit, no-loss
basis for the government, which charges a fee (\$15,000 or 3.8 percent
of item and service cost, whichever is greater) to cover administration
costs. There is some advantage to selling items through FMS rather than
DCS, as FMS transfers items already in use with the U.S. military, thus
offering the potential for lower per-unit costs for the U.S. operating
service, as well as standardization of weapons between the United States
and an allied country. **[Unlike FMS, DCS is managed by the State
Department. Direct commercial sales do not require the coordination of
the Defense Department]{.underline}**, as contract negotiations occur
directly between the contractor and the recipient country, requiring
nothing more than an export license, which is issued by the Office of
Defense Trade Controls at the State Department\'s Bureau of
Political-Military Affairs. Thus, the costs of DCS are often lower than
for FMS.

## T Arms

Some companies in the G8 countries have been involved in the supply of
security equipment and devices whose prime practical purpose is for
torture or ill-treatment. In many more cases, companies supply devices
designed for security and crime control purposes but which in reality
can easily lend themselves to torture and ill-treatment. **[For example,
US]{.underline}**, Russian, French and German **[companies are amongst
the two hundred and thirty companies]{.underline}** in 35 countries
making, **[distributing or brokering the supply of electro-shock
weapons]{.underline}**. G8 **[governments do not have in place effective
laws and regulations to prevent the export of such equipment to foreign
security forces that are known to abuse legitimate devices to inflict
torture.]{.underline}**

### DCS

#### The Aff limits DCS of torture devices

**ARMS SALES MONITOR '95** ("COMMERCE DEPT. LICENSES EXPORT OF TORTURE
DEVICES", https://fas.org/asmp/library/asm/asm30.htmNo. 30 (20 July
1995)//JC)

It would probably surprise most **[American]{.underline}**s to learn
that their **[government licenses instruments of torture for export to
countries around the world.]{.underline}** From September 1991-December
1993, the Commerce Department approved over 350 export licenses, worth
more than \$27 million, for torture and police equipment under commodity
category 0A82C. According to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations,
**[this broad-ranging category includes: \"saps, thumbcuffs,
thumbscrews, leg irons, shackles, and handcuffs; specially designed
implements of torture; strait jackets, plastic handcuffs, police helmets
and shields; and parts and accessories]{.underline}**.\" (See p.2)
Another export category, 0A84C, combines electric shock batons and
cattle prods with shotguns and shells. Over 2,000 licenses were granted
for these items. We obtained the information under a Freedom of
Information Act request for data on gun exports. **[These licenses
represent the government\'s permission for the export]{.underline}** to
go forward; they do not indicate actual delivery. **[By lumping
controversial items]{.underline}** (like thumbscrews) together with
non-controversial ones (like helmets) **[into broad general
categories]{.underline}**, Commerce effectively frustrates public
oversight. This makes many suspect the worst, especially when these
commodities are licensed for export to governments with well-documented
records of human rights abuse. For example, Commerce approved \$10.5
million to Saudi Arabia, where government officials \"continued to
torture and otherwise abuse detainees, including citizens and
foreigners,\" according to the State Department\'s latest human rights
report. Compared to the State and Commerce Departments, the Pentagon is
a paragon of openness. The Defense Department regularly and readily
discloses information about government-negotiated Foreign Military
Sales\-\--e.g., what and how much weaponry it is exporting and to whom.
State and Commerce withhold similar data about sales which they license.
Because **[these sales are negotiated directly by the arms industry,
this information is considered proprietary, although not
classified]{.underline}** (see ASM No. 27).

### Includes small arms

#### Arms includes small arms. 

**State Department, 2k** -- US Dept of State, Bureau of Verification and
Compliance ("World Military Expenditures Arms Transfers 1998"
<https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/110701.pdf>

**[Arms transfers]{.underline}** (arms imports and exports) **[represent
the international transfer (under terms of grant, credit, barter, or
cash) of military equipment,]{.underline}** usually referred to as
"conventional," **[including weapons of war, parts]{.underline}**
thereof, **[ammunition, support equipment, and other commodities
designed for military use]{.underline}**. **[Among the items included
are]{.underline}** tactical guided missiles and rockets, military
aircraft, naval vessels, armored and nonarmored military vehicles,
communications and electronic equipment, artillery, infantry weapons,
**[small arms]{.underline}**, ammunition, other ordnance, parachutes,
and uniforms. **[Dual use]{.underline}** equipment, which can have
application in both military and civilian sectors, **[is included when
its primary mission is identified as military]{.underline}**. **[The
building of defense production facilities and licensing fees paid as
royalties for the production of military equipment are
included]{.underline}** when they are contained in military transfer
agreements. There have been no international transfers of purely
strategic weaponry. **[Military services such as training, supply
operations, equipment repair, technical assistance, and construction are
included]{.underline}** where data are available. **[Excluded are
foodstuffs, medical equipment, petroleum products and other
supplies]{.underline}**.

#### Arms includes small arms and doesn't have to be strictly for military use

**Teichert, 8** -- Counsel of Record (Jeffrey, BRIEF AMICUS CURIAE OF
ORGANIZATIONS AND SCHOLARS CORRECTING MYTHS AND MISREPRESENTATIONS
COMMONLY DEPLOYED BY OPPONENTS OF AN INDIVIDUAL-RIGHTS-BASED
INTERPRETATION OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT IN SUPPORT OF RESPONDENT,
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, et al., Petitioners, v. DICK ANTHONY HELLER,
Respondent. ,
<https://www.nraila.org/heller/proamicusbriefs/07-290_amicus_citizenscommittee.pdf>

**[The District quotes selectively from definition]{.underline}** 2.a.
of the word "arm" in the Oxford English Dictionary ("OED") **[to suggest
that the term "arms" only includes war weapons.]{.underline}** (Pet.Br.
15.) **[The full definition is: Instruments]{.underline}** of offence
**[used in war; weapons. fire-arms]{.underline}**: those for which
gunpowder is used, such as guns and pistols, as opposed to swords,
spears, or bows. **[small-arms]{.underline}**: those not requiring
carriages, as opposed to artillery. stand of arms: a complete set for
one soldier. 1 OED 634 (2d ed. 2000). **[This definition includes the
term "weapons" as well as "fire-arms," which makes no reference to
military uses, and "small-arms]{.underline}**" which defines small
weapons "as opposed to artillery," **[contrasting a military
weapon]{.underline}**. While war weapons are covered by the definition,
two of its subparts require no military context.

The District quotes a 1794 reference in the OED mentioning arms used in
war. (Pet.Br. 15.) However, this is only one of several references. A
reference prior to the Bill of Rights was, "1650 T. B. Worcester's
Apophth. 97 They were come to search his house for Armes." 1 OED, supra,
at 634. **[While a military application of the term "arms" is one
possibility, it is not the exclusive meaning]{.underline}**. The
District's argument ignores several general definitions. For example,
definition III.10, from a 1641 reference: "Arms, in the understanding of
law is extended to any thing that a man, in his anger or fury, takes in
his hand to cast at or strike another." Id. (emphasis supplied).

### State Department and Commerce

#### These are the CI cards, but torture devices would not meet their interp of only State department

#### DCS is approved by both State and Commerce, depending on the item

**Hays, 16 -** Laurie Hays, an international trade specialist on the
Aerospace Team in the U.S. Department of Commerce's International Trade
Administration ("2016-17 Defense Export Handbook" International Trade
Administration, December,
<https://www.trade.gov/td/otm/assets/aero/DefHB_FULL.pdf>

**[Things to]{.underline}** understand and **[confirm prior to
submitting a DCS bid to a foreign government:]{.underline}**

**[• Confirm the type of export control license needed, based on
jurisdiction:]{.underline}** Export Administration Regulations (**[EAR),
which are regulated by the Department of Commerce, or]{.underline}**
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (**[ITAR), which are regulated
by DOS]{.underline}**.

• Whether any sanctions would preclude a sale (section 126.1 of the
ITAR).

• Identification of penalties that could be imposed if regulations are
not upheld. 3

• Know that with DCS, if the foreign entity withholds payment, a company
has no direct recourse to payment collection from the U.S. government.

ITA primarily assists exporters implementing DCS projects; however the
ITAs Advocacy Center provides advocacy for both DCS and FMS cases
through the Advocacy Center4 . A company can contact a Commercial
Services U.S. Export Assistance Centers (USEACs) in their local area for
support also.

Ultimately, the U.S. Government authorizes both FMS and DCS sales---but
in different ways. For FMS, DSCA and the Department of State (DOS)
review and initiate new FMS cases, based on national security and
foreign policy priorities. The U.S. Government is exporting on behalf of
the U.S. vendor under the authority of the LOA, so the items do not
require an export license. **[Under DCS, USML and dual-use items require
an export license.]{.underline}** **[The contractor must apply to either
the Department of State or the Department of Commerce, depending on
jurisdiction, to obtain an export license]{.underline}**. In either
method (FMS or DCS), the U.S. Government makes a final decision to
authorize a defense export.

#### Both State and Commerce have jurisdiction

**Nichols, 14 --** partner, Covington & Burling LLP (Robert, "DIRECT
COMMERCIAL SALES" 9/30,
https://www.dsca.mil/sites/default/files/final-fms-dcs_30_sep.pdf

Pursuant to the U.S. export control regime, **[DCS transactions must
comply with]{.underline}** the U.S. Government's **[export licensing
requirements. Here]{.underline}**, the U.S. Department of
**[State]{.underline}**, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls
("**[DDTC]{.underline}**"), **[and]{.underline}** **[the U.S. Department
of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security]{.underline}** ("BIS"),
**[exercise primary jurisdiction]{.underline}**.92 Traditionally,
**[DDTC has exercised jurisdiction over transactions involving defense
articles and services]{.underline}**. **[BIS exercises jurisdiction over
transactions involving commercial or "dual-use"]{.underline}** (i.e.,
both commercial and military) **[articles and services.]{.underline}**
**[Both agencies could have jurisdiction over a DCS transaction.
However, as a result of]{.underline}** recent U.S. **[export control
reforms, BIS has acquired increased jurisdiction over certain defense
items]{.underline}**. For example, **[DDTC often licenses the export and
reexport of key end-items]{.underline}** (e.g., fighter aircraft),
**[while BIS authorizes the export]{.underline}** and retransfer **[of
many of the end-items' parts, components, accessories, attachments, and
associated equipment]{.underline}** (e.g., aircraft tires; filters;
brake wear pads; and cockpit-panel knobs, indicators, switches, buttons,
and dials).

With some exceptions, a DDTC license or other approval is required for
the export, reexport, retransfer, or temporary import of a defense
article and service (including technical data). U.S. Government arms
embargoes and other proscriptions bar some foreign countries, including
China, 95 from receiving any defense articles or services (including
technical data) subject to the ITAR. DDTC prohibits the release of any
articles or services (including technical data) subject to the ITAR to
these countries, companies incorporated in these countries, or other
companies owned or controlled by the government or companies of these
countries. DDTC also closely restricts exports to any individual that is
a national of one of these countries, whether that release occurs in the
United States or abroad, absent a license, approval, or exemption.

Meanwhile, BIS oversees transactions involving commercial and dual-use
items, exercising its jurisdiction pursuant to the Export Administration
Regulations ("EAR").96 BIS has broad authority to regulate virtually all
exports from the United States that are not subject to the jurisdiction
of another agency (e.g., DDTC), and to regulate reexports from one
non-U.S. country to another of U.S. items or of non-U.S. products that
contain more than de minimis U.S. content. That said, BIS controls only
a small subset of such exports, based on the sensitivity of the item, as
well as the nature of the end-use and end-user.

#### DCS includes the Commerce Department

**NDIA, 19** - National Defense Industrial Association ("Foreign
Military Sales vs Direct Commercial Sales"
<http://www.ndia.org/policy/international/fms-vs-dcs>

DCS Process

**[DCS is]{.underline}** regarded as a more **[flexible]{.underline}**
process, **[as the purchaser consults directly with
industry]{.underline}** about specific products and services it needs.
Foreign customers leverage more negotiating power regarding the type of
contract (fixed price or firm fixed price), how the contract is written,
final delivery requirements, and methods of payment. However, they must
carry more risk and administrative burdens. DCS has the added benefit of
giving customers options to purchase more non-standard systems that are
mission specific, and designed to tackle readiness challenges. In these
cases, the Pentagon does not support these types of mission requirements
in their stockpiles, or in their annual budget.

**[Qualifying for an export license through DCS is based on how a
product or service is categorized. The State Department]{.underline}**'s
Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) **[executes authority in
issuing export licenses to all defense related products and services on
the U.S. Munitions List]{.underline}** (USML), **[pursuant
to]{.underline}** the International Traffic in Arms Regulations
**[(ITAR).]{.underline}** **[The Department of Commerce]{.underline}**'s
Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) **[grants export licenses to more
commercial and "dual-use" defense products and services]{.underline}**
**[on the Commerce Control List]{.underline}** (CCL), pursuant to the
Export Administration Regulations (EAR).

Like the FMS program, DCS advances interoperability between the U.S
military and its allies. Furthermore, foreign countries use FMF funding
to purchase U.S. defense products and systems through both the FMS
program and, on occasion, the DCS process.

#### Commerce Department regulations include DCS under Commerce jurisdiction

### Maybe: Military services definition

#### Military services are maintenance, repair, training, technical assistance and logistics

**Perlo-Freeman, 17 -** Dr Sam Perlo-Freeman was the Head of the SIPRI
Project on Military Expenditure in the Arms Transfers and Military
Expenditure Programme. He is currently on leave of absence to work with
the World Peace Foundation where he leads the Global Arms Trade and

trade? (part 2)" 9/25,
<https://sites.tufts.edu/reinventingpeace/2017/09/25/just-how-big-is-the-international-arms-trade-part-2/>

We are interested in deliveries, however, for which separate figures are
provided, at least for defense equipment (articles); data for deliveries
of DCS defense services are not available, as no-one collects this
data.\[2\] Unfortunately, this data is incomplete, as it is based on
voluntary reporting by companies at the point of shipment. As a result,
the figures are in general substantial underestimates of total DCS
deliveries. Figure 1 shows the value of official figures for DCS
deliveries from 1971 to 2015, from which the highly erratic nature of
these figures is evident.
