#### Taxes on arms sales should fund anti-hunger campaigns

**VoA 4** (Brazil\'s Proposal to Tax Arms Sales to Fund UN Anti-Poverty
Programs Discussed at Geneva Meeting,
<http://www.defense-aerospace.com/article-view/feature/32795/un-to-debate-proposal-to-tax-arms-sales.html)//BB>

[The presidents of France, Brazil, Chili and the United Nations
secretary-general have signed on to a new plan for eradicating poverty
and hunger]{.underline} in the world. [The]{.underline} world
[leaders]{.underline} have jointly [unveiled proposals which include
taxing the sale of arms to raise the money needed to tackle global
destitution]{.underline}. [The world leaders admit they have to come up
with new money in a hurry or their battle to cut poverty and
hunger]{.underline} in half by the year 2015 [will be lost]{.underline}.
This latest plan to tackle global destitution is the brainchild of
Brazil\'s President, Luiz Inacio \"Lula\" da Silva. He says there are
many ways of helping developing countries improve their economic and
social situations. He says it is possible to support them through freer
international trade, foreign debt relief, foreign investment and greater
international aid. He says [taxing the sale of arms could be a new
source of revenue for fighting poverty]{.underline}. \"We have decided
to set up a working group to study all proposals on alternative
financing mechanisms such as [the taxation of arms trade]{.underline}
and on certain financial operations,\" he said. \"The resources raised
by such mechanisms [would finance the establishment of a fund to fight
**hunger** and poverty]{.underline}.\" French President Jacques Chirac
is a staunch supporter of the Brazilian president\'s proposal. He notes
that the weapons trade amounts to about \$900 billion a year. He says
taxes from that and from other sources should be put into a new fund,
which he nicknames the Lula Fund, to fight poverty. \"I am convinced
that we shall not be able to avoid setting up a system of taxation, an
international taxation system,\" he said. \"Some people will be aware
that I have set up a working group to study this proposal, a working
group with representatives of the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and
the World Bank involved.\" U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan notes more
than one billion people struggle to survive with less than one dollar a
day, about 840 million people are affected by hunger and an estimated
24,000 people die every day from hunger-related causes. Yet, he says
only 11 years are left to meet the U.N.\'s Millennium Development goal
of substantially reducing the number of people stricken by poverty,
hunger and disease. \"[We all need to make special efforts to accelerate
progress]{.underline} during this year and next,\" he said. \"If we are
not on track by the end of 2005, we shall already know that many of
these goals will not be reached by 2015. Even if we make heroic efforts
to catch up in the 10 remaining years.\" Mr. Annan says last year, [many
world leaders were distracted by matters of war and peace.]{.underline}
He says [issues of poverty, hunger and disease do not grab the headlines
in the same way]{.underline}. [Nevertheless]{.underline}, he says the
[leaders must refocus their attention on these urgent life and death
issues]{.underline}.

[High up in the mountain regions of Northwest Nepal, winter has always
meant long days with little to ea]{.underline}t from November through
March. Temperatures rarely creep above freezing, making growing anything
except winter wheat a near-impossible task. [This is starting to change
thanks to the Nepal Agriculture Food Security Project, a US\$58 million
project funded by]{.underline} the Global Agriculture and Food Security
Program (**[GAFSP]{.underline}**) and the Government of Nepal. For the
first time in Nepal, three government ministries---the Ministry of
Agricultural Development, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of
Livestock Development---are working closely to jointly implement the
project with technical support from the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO). Through the project, [farmers are receiving support
to diversify the crops and breeds of animals they are working with, and
nutrition training has helped reduce maternal and child
malnutrition]{.underline}---[a serious problem in these remote rural
villages. The project has made funding available to farmers to set up
plastic polytunnels or greenhouses]{.underline} in the most remote
mountain areas. [These greenhouses]{.underline}---often perched on tiny
terraces that are no more than 4.5 meters (15 feet) wide---[allow
farmers to grow spinach and other green vegetables year-round. Combined
with the introduction of new breeds of chickens that produce more meat
and eggs]{.underline}, a reliable source of protein to farming families,
[nutrition levels]{.underline} in the project communities **[are
starting to improve]{.underline}**. But producing more food is only one
part of the solution. Women from within the communities have formed
groups that meet regularly, usually convened by a local nutrition
expert. During these meetings, they share recipes and techniques they
have developed to incorporate the new foods into their diets. This has
helped raise awareness among people within the communities on the
importance of balanced diets. Now that farmers are seeing the benefits
of a more nutritious diet, they are including vegetables when planning
what to grow and can produce them year-round in the greenhouses.
Boosting incomes vital for long-term change With 25.2 percent of Nepal's
population living below the poverty line and agriculture by far the
largest source of livelihood in the country, **[investing in agriculture
is key to eradicating hunger]{.underline}** but is also vital for
boosting incomes. Women make up 65 percent of the agricultural workforce
in Nepal, but their access to health care, nutrition, and education, and
their ability to participate in decision-making within their communities
is significantly less than men. [By supporting local]{.underline} seed
[cooperatives]{.underline} and introducing new breeds of goats that
command a much better price in the markets across Nepal, [the project is
helping farmers to **establish a regular source of
income.**]{.underline} Kaushila Thapa, a seed farmer who is part of the
project, says, "I barely had enough money for household costs and for
savings. But now, both my husband and I save money every month." With
the money, she has been able to get access to health services and send
her kids to school---something that previously she could not afford to
do. Kaushila and other women in her community have found that having
their own income has changed the power dynamics within their families.
"It used to be only men who worked outside and in the fields. But now
women know that they can do anything," she says. Her experience was
echoed by Hastikala Birkatta Magar who runs a goat farm, a job typically
done by men. She explained that her husband used to keep the money
raised from selling their goats, but she is now expanding the farm and
investing in the local farming cooperative. She has plans to register
her company and make the farm bigger. Not only can she put food on the
table for her family but she has gained independence, something she
values highly. The GAFSP: One of the most efficient multi-stakeholder
funds In total, [93 percent of available GAFSP programs go into grants
to the world's poorest countries, making it]{.underline} one of **[the
most efficient multi-stakeholder fund]{.underline}**s [and able to reach
the local farmers that produce the majority of the world's
food]{.underline}. But **[despite]{.underline}** the
**[successes]{.underline}** in Nepal, [the future of the GAFSP is
uncertain]{.underline}. It was set up at the 2009 G-20 Summit in
Pittsburgh in response to the global food price crisis, when world
leaders recognized that investment in local agriculture in countries
where food insecurity was highest was urgently needed to tackle global
hunger. Despite having supported projects in more than 30 countries
across Africa, Asia, and the Americas, [the U.S.]{.underline} Under
Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs
[announced]{.underline} in November 2017 [that the U.S. is not expecting
to make any future contributions to GAFSP]{.underline}. As the main
investor in the fund, **[the U.S. withdrawal will significantly impact
efforts to fight poverty in some of the world's poorest
countries]{.underline}**. Given the right support, local communities
know what is needed to reduce hunger and poverty. But [the number of
people going hungry around the world has increased in the past couple of
years and fears are being raised about a new food crisis]{.underline}.
[It's vital that funds like the GAFSP that give local farmers more
control over how the money is spent can continue. By investing in local
farmers,]{.underline} not big agribusiness, [we can eradicate global
hunger and reduce poverty.]{.underline} World [leaders]{.underline}
recognized it when the last food crisis hit. Now they **[need to act to
make sure these investments can continue.]{.underline}**

#### Food shortages lead to nuclear war

**FDI 12** - a Research institute providing strategic analysis of
Australia's global interests; citing Lindsay Falvery, PhD in
Agricultural Science and former Professor at the University of
Melbourne's Institute of Land and Environment (Future Directions
International, , "Food and Water Insecurity: International Conflict
Triggers & Potential Conflict Points,"
<http://www.futuredirections.org.au/workshop-papers/537-international-conflict-triggers-and-potential-conflict-points-resulting-from-food-and-water-insecurity.html>)

[There is a **growing appreciation**]{.underline} [that]{.underline} the
[[conflicts]{.mark} in the next century [will **most likely** be fought
over a lack of resources]{.mark}.]{.underline} Yet, in a sense, [this is
not new. Researchers point to the French and Russian revolutions
as]{.underline} conflicts [induced by a lack of food.]{.underline} More
recently, [**Germany's World War Two** efforts are said to have been
inspired]{.underline}, at least in part, [by its perceived need to gain
access to more food]{.underline}. Yet the general sense among those that
attended FDI's recent workshops, was that [the scale of the problem in
the future could be **significantly greater**]{.underline} as a result
of population pressures, changing weather, urbanisation, migration, loss
of arable land and other farm inputs, and increased affluence in the
developing world. In his book, Small Farmers Secure Food, [Lindsay
Falvey]{.underline}, a participant in FDI's March 2012 workshop on the
issue of food and conflict, clearly [expresses the problem]{.underline}
and why countries across the globe are starting to take note. . He
writes (p.36), "...[if people are hungry]{.underline}, especially in
cities, **[the state is not stable]{.underline}** -- riots, violence,
breakdown of law and order and migration result." "[Hunger feeds
anarchy]{.underline}." This view is also shared by [Julian
Cribb]{.underline}, who in his book, The Coming Famine, [writes that
[if]{.mark} "large [regions]{.mark} of the world [run short of
food]{.mark}]{.underline}, land or water in the decades that lie ahead,
then **[wholesale, bloody [wars are liable to
follow]{.mark}]{.underline}**." He continues: "[[An increasingly
credible scenario for **World War 3** is]{.underline}]{.mark} not so
much a confrontation of super powers and their allies, as [a
**festering, [self-perpetuating chain of resource
conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}." He also says: "The wars of the 21st
Century are less likely to be global conflicts with sharply defined
sides and huge armies, than a scrappy mass of failed states, rebellions,
civil strife, insurgencies, terrorism and genocides, sparked by bloody
competition over dwindling resources." As another workshop participant
put it, people do not go to war to kill; they go to war over resources,
either to protect or to gain the resources for themselves. Another
observed that hunger results in passivity not conflict. Conflict is over
resources, not because people are going hungry. [A [**study** by **the
I**]{.mark}nternational **[P]{.mark}**eace **[R]{.mark}**esearch
**[I]{.mark}**nstitute [indicates]{.mark} that where [food
security]{.mark} is an issue, it [is]{.mark} more [likely to result
in]{.mark} some form of [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. [**[Darfur,
Rwanda, Eritrea and the Balkan]{.mark}s** [experienced]{.mark} such
[wars]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Governments]{.underline}, especially in
developed countries, [are increasingly aware of this phenomenon. [The
UK]{.mark} Ministry of Defence, the [CIA]{.mark}, the]{.underline} US

#### The FMS Trust is a [profit-generating]{.underline} account

**Sanders 18** - Editor of two reference books published by LexisNexis.

The Federal Acquisition Regulation. The second book is Matthew Bender's
Accounting for Government Contracts: The Cost Accounting Standards
(Nick, Generating Profits Through Foreign Military Sales,

We want to unpack that last point a bit. Why should FMS transactions be
any more expensive than DCS transactions? One answer to that question is
that [the]{.underline} Defense Security Cooperation Agency
([DSCA]{.underline})---the DoD component that administers FMS
transactions\-\--[charges governments a transaction fee for their
services]{.underline}. As GAO recently noted, "DSCA charges purchasers
certain overhead fees to cover the U.S. government's costs for operating
the FMS program. These fees include the administrative fee, which covers
costs such as civilian employee salaries, facilities, and information
systems, and the contract administration services (CAS) fee, which
covers the costs of quality assurance and inspection, contract
management, and contract audits. These fees are collected in separate
accounts in the FMS trust fund, which is used for payments received from
purchasers and disbursements made to implement FMS." In other words,
foreign governments that directly contract with U.S. defense contractors
are responsible for administrating and managing their contracts; whereas
governments that contract through DSCA via the FMS program have those
services provided by DoD entities---for a price. That price covers the
listed services, and within those listed services one finds contract
administration and quality assurance (DCMA) and contract audit (DCAA).
Presumably, CAS provides assurance that the foreign customers are
getting what they are paying for, and that the price they are paying is
considered to be fair and reasonable. GAO reported that "The base CAS
fee has three subcomponents, which are currently set at (1) 0.5 percent
for quality assurance and inspection, (2) 0.5 percent for contract
management, and (3) 0.2 percent for contract audits." [The U.S.
government intends that its FMS administration
fee]{.underline}---currently 3.5% of the FMS agreement (or case)
value---[is a break-even fee. It is not intending to profit from the
fee.]{.underline} In fact, GAO reports that the Standard FMS Terms and
Conditions "indicates that the U.S. government will not profit from the
FMS program." The problem is that **[the U.S. Government is profiting to
the tune of billions of dollars]{.underline}**. GAO report GAO-18-401,
published May 10, 2018, told Congress and the public that "[The FMS
administrative account balance grew by over 950 percent from fiscal
years 2007 to 2017]{.underline}---from \$391 million to \$4.1
billion---due in part to insufficient management controls, including the
lack of timely rate reviews." (Emphasis added.) Further, GAO reported
that "The FMS CAS account grew from fiscal years 2007 to 2015 from \$69
million to \$981 million, due in part to insufficient management
controls ..." So when DSCA and other DoD officials blithely note that
FMS transactions are neither the quickest nor the least expensive option
for foreign customers, what they are really saying is that FMS sales do
not represent good value for money. FMS transactions take longer than
they should and they cost more than they should. FMS transactions do not
represent the optimum sales channel, nor do they lead to fair and
reasonable prices. It's not the contractors' fault: it's the DoD's
fault. [When using the FMS program, DoD expects its foreign partners to
pay]{.underline} for the privilege of slowing down weapon system
delivery. And **[DoD is profiting from the situation]{.underline}**.

#### Excess funds should be re-purposed towards other expenses

**GAO 18** - FOREIGN MILITARY SALES Controls Should Be Strengthened to
Address Substantial Growth in Overhead Account Balances,
<https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/692484.pdf>

[The]{.underline} Foreign Military Sales ([FMS]{.underline})
administrative [account balance grew]{.underline} by over [950
percent]{.underline} from fiscal years 2007 to 2017---from \$391 million
to \$4.1 billion--- due in part to insufficient management controls,
including the lack of timely rate reviews. The Defense Security
Cooperation Agency (DSCA) has some controls to manage the account
balance. For example, [DSCA has established a method for calculating a
minimum desired balance to ensure it has sufficient funds to complete
FMS cases despite uncertain future sales]{.underline}. [At the end of
fiscal year 2017, the account balance was **\$2.7 billion above** this
minimum]{.underline}. DSCA, however, has completed rate reviews less
frequently than directed by its policy. Moreover, DSCA has not adopted
the best practice of setting an upper bound for the account that would,
along with the minimum level, provide a target range for the account
balance. By not performing timely rate reviews or setting an upper
bound, DSCA has limited its ability to prevent excessive balance growth.
GAO modeling indicates that, even with a planned fee rate reduction to
3.2 percent, the account balance would likely remain above its minimum
level through fiscal year 2024, including if annual expenditures
increased by 15 percent more than expected. [As such, the account has
the potential to pay for **additional expenses**]{.underline}. [These
could include expenses first excluded by statute in 1989 at a time when
the account balance was negative and which have since been paid from
other appropriated funds.]{.underline} DOD told GAO it is willing to
revisit these exclusions.

Foreign military sales administrative account. [The U.S. government
sells defense equipment and services worth tens of billions of dollars
each year to its foreign partners through]{.underline} the Foreign
Military Sales ([FMS]{.underline}) program. To cover the program's
operating costs, [DOD collects an administrative fee]{.underline} from
purchasers [and places it into the administrative account of the FMS
trust fund]{.underline}. Since 1989, a portion of FMS program operating
expenses, for military pay and unfunded civilian retirement and other
benefits, have been paid instead from other appropriated funds. In 2018,
we found that the FMS administrative account had grown to contain over
\$4 billion and that it likely would continue to have sufficient funds
to pay for program expenses through at least fiscal year 2024 even if
the account were to cover more annual expenses than expected.31
[Congress could enhance federal revenue by]{.underline} at least **[tens
of millions of dollars]{.underline}** annually [through expanding the
definition of allowable expenses authorized to be covered by the FMS
administrative account]{.underline}, thereby likely reducing the need to
cover these expenses with other appropriated funds.

### 2NC -- Sales Key

#### Each sale is key

It is important to note that the FMS process is conducted at no cost to
the U.S. taxpayer. [**Each sale** has an associated surcharge that
collects funding from partner nations into the FMS Trust Fund
Administrative Surcharge Account]{.underline}. DSCA provides funds from
this account to the military services and defense agencies over the
entire life of FMS cases to execute the FMS process and deliver the
equipment, services, and training to our international partners. Broadly
speaking, the FMS system currently has over \$460 billion in total
program value on over 13,500 cases. In turn, very [strong
sales]{.underline} over the past few years [has led to growth in the FMS
Administrative Surcharge Account that aligns to the corresponding growth
in value of the yetto-be-delivered equipment, services, and training
that partners have paid for]{.underline}, either in whole or in part.

### 2NC -- Funding Reallocation

#### Funds placed into the FMS-AA can be used for other expenses.

[The DSCA manages financial resources for the FMS program through the
FMS trust fund. The]{.underline} FMS trust [fund is divided into two
separate accounts]{.underline}: the [case management]{.underline}
account [and the]{.underline} FMS-administrative account
([FMS-AA]{.underline}). The case management account handles case
requirements, with subaccounts tied to specific countries and cases.
[The FMS--AA]{.underline}, however, [**is a general deposit account.**
Once money has been deposited]{.underline} into the FMS--AA[, it no
longer retains its origins]{.underline} but is available to cover
expenses for any administrative function. These expenses include
salaries, travel, equipment, and rent. [The FMS--AA is similar to a
personal savings account: Money is available for use regardless of where
the money originally came from]{.underline}. Figure 10 gives an overview
of income and expenditures of the FMS trust fund in FY2010 (DSCA,

administrative [surcharge rate is not locked-in-stone and **should be
reviewed frequently** to ensure it is allowing us to collect the
appropriate amount of revenue]{.underline} to ensure full cost recovery.
If the annual review shows that our current cost recovery is not where
it needs to be (either too high or too low), [DSCA will
consider]{.underline} options for correcting the problem. Those options
may include [a rate change, additional process reforms, or changes to
the way we collect the surcharge]{.underline} e.g., the requirement to
collect 50 percent of the administrative surcharge funds upon case
implementation may require adjustment. We do not envision an annual rate
change, but [we need to do more frequent, widely-published, analysis to
ensure we can identify problems, and make decisions in a timely
manner.]{.underline}

Impact - What Next?

During the course of developing these changes and obtaining interagency
approval, [one of the most frequent questions posed was whether the new
administrative surcharge structure and rate would drive customers away
from FMS]{.underline}. Our answer to this question is
**[no.]{.underline}** [There are many reasons why our partners choose
FMS]{.underline}. While cost is certainly a consideration in any
procurement strategy, we believe that it is not the only factor.
[Customers choose FMS to allow the U.S. government to bring the full
weight of the DoD community and our leadership into the execution and
performance of the sale]{.underline}. [Others desire to further their
military-to-military relationship with the U.S. government through
FMS]{.underline}. In some instances, U.S. industry may also regard FMS
as the preferred method of sale. [These reasons remain constant
regardless of surcharge changes]{.underline}. While we have not tried to
make direct comparisons between FMS and similar support provided by U.S.
industry or other defense agencies, our research did show that the FMS
program is competitive when compared to similar activities e.g., the
Defense LogisticsAgency Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF) and the
Office of Management and Budget Most Efficient Organization (MEO)
benchmark rates. [Even with an administrative surcharge rate of 3.8
percent, we believe we continue to be good value for the money and are
confident our customers will continue to agree]{.underline}.

On average, DRR practices have generated benefits 2.2 times higher than
practices previously used by farmers, including in increased
agricultural production and avoided hazard-associated risks. [In hazard
scenarios, **for every dollar invested**]{.underline} in DRR, **[the
farmer achieved \$3.7 in terms of avoided loss or return]{.underline}**.
[And under non-hazard conditions, the return rose even further, **to
\$4.5.**]{.underline} [These practices can benefit billions of people,
**preventing economic losses** and delivering economic benefits at
regional and national levels. **Greater upfront investment in
anticipatory measures is also more cost efficient** than post-disaster
spending on reconstruction and recovery]{.underline}, the report says.
This can be done through farmer-to-farmer replication, or when local
farmers begin to adopt new techniques after observing the benefits their
neighbors gained when doing so. This method requires little investment
or institutional support. [Another avenue is through large-scale efforts
that require **government**]{.underline} and private sector **[support
to promote the practices at scale]{.underline}**. Crucially, both
[pathways depend on good infrastructure, adequate investment and an

[**Strong leadership and action by the United States has a multiplier
effect** many times over by eliciting bilateral, multilateral, and
philanthropic efforts by others. The rates of return on US investments
are hig]{.underline}h not just because of the power of those investments
themselves, but [because they lead to **much larger investments** by
others that **enhance agricultural production**, food **security**, and
improved **nutrition**]{.underline}. For example, several major
bilateral donors stood up in 2009 at the G8 Summit in L'Aquila, Italy,
to launch major commitments to global food security. In addition to the
US commitment of \$3.5 billion over three years, the European Union
pledged \$3.8 billion, Germany and Japan each \$3 billion, France \$2.2
billion, the Netherlands \$2 billion, the United Kingdom \$1.7 billion,
and Canada \$1 billion. Australia, Italy, Russia, Spain, and Sweden also
contributed, bringing the total pledge to \$22.2 billion over a
three-year period.87 The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation also made a
pledge at the 2009 summit and has committed more than \$2 billion to
global food security efforts. [Each \$1 dollar of US commitment helped
**leverage more than \$6** from other donors. By 2015 more than 93
percent of these commitments had been disbursed, helping to strengthen
agriculture and nutrition efforts around the world]{.underline}. In
conjunction with these efforts, the World Bank established the Global
Agriculture and Food Security Program (**[GAFSP]{.underline}**) as a
multilateral mechanism to support global food security efforts. Nine
countries, again with the Gates Foundation, have contributed to the
fund. GAFSP [has both a public-sector window to support government and
regional programs and a private-sector window to provide loans, credit
guarantees, and equity to support]{.underline} private-sector activities
related to [agricultural development]{.underline} and food security. In
addition to GAFSP, the World Bank has committed more than \$8 billion to
agriculture and food security related issues, based in part on strong
leadership from the United States as its largest shareholder. The
African Development Bank (AfDB), the region's multilateral development
bank, also finances a range of programs related to agricultural
production, food security, and nutrition, which have taken on increasing
priority within the institution in recent years. For example, at the
2016 African Green Revolution Forum (AGRF) the AfDB pledged \$24 billion
over the next 10 years to agricultural transformation in Africa.88
Similarly, the Asian Development Bank has recently shifted its strategic
focus from agricultural production to a more comprehensive strategy on
food security. The wide range of funding sources makes clear that a new
model of financing for global food security has emerged in recent years
in which **[US leadership spurs global support for food security
goals]{.underline}**. [The importance of US leadership cannot be
underestimated and must continue to drive the desperately needed
commitments by others to solve food and nutrition security]{.underline}
challenges.

[The United States faces a crucial juncture. It can forcefully respond
to food and nutrition security challenges with strong leadership, smart
investments, effective global cooperation, and sound policy choices that
will **help fight hunger and malnutrition**]{.underline} and strengthen
US national security. [This would give hundreds of millions more people
the opportunity to **lift themselves out of poverty and
hunger**]{.underline} in the next two decades, [with
benefits]{.underline} to high- and low-income countries alike,
[including **greater stability, security, and prosperity around the
world**]{.underline}. The United States has the opportunity to
demonstrate generosity and leadership at this critical moment by
reinforcing the US commitment to global food and nutrition security.
[Alternatively, the United States can choose to play only a modest role,
treating food and nutrition security as a minor issue, ignoring signs of
growing stress to the global food system, leaving leadership to other
world powers,]{.underline} [and **reacting to crises around the world
only after they erupt**]{.underline}. [This failure to act forcefully
will likely lead to **an uptick in poverty**, **increases in hunger and
disease, growing conflict**, and **increasing numbers of refugees and
cross-border migration**]{.underline}. When [there has been a decline in
support for agricultural development]{.underline} by national
governments and donors in the past, even as overall areas of development
assistance remained constant or increased, a slowing of agricultural
progress and **[backsliding has followed]{.underline}**. Indeed, [this
path would **reverse the progress** that has been made thanks to US
leadership, which would result in **heightened global economic** and
political **instability**, increased **migration pressures**, and
significant **security threats**.]{.underline} It would also extend the
timeline and inflate the ultimate costs of solving the scourge of food
and nutrition insecurity in the 21st century. [America's agricultural
development and nutrition assistance matters because **US leadership
creates a cascade of positive effects**.]{.underline} Globally, [the
United States inspires others to persist in their efforts, and it
incentivizes governments in low-income countries to invest in their own
national systems]{.underline}. [It instills confidence in
the]{.underline} US [private sector]{.underline} to have the US
government stand beside it as it invests in frontier markets with the
aim of building their businesses and building a world without hunger.
And [US leadership on global food and nutrition security shows civil
society]{.underline}, including leading humanitarian NGOs and
faith-based organizations, [that their leaders share their values and
vision for a safe and just world. To address the challenges
facing]{.underline} the United States and threatening [global
security]{.underline}, the US administration, together with
[Congress]{.underline}, [**should support investments** that take an
integrated approach to agricultural-led economic growth, nutrition, and
food system resilience]{.underline} through innovation and new
technologies. To succeed, the administration and Congress must work
closely with private businesses, the agricultural community,
entrepreneurs, investors, universities, research institutions, and civil
society. These investments should aim to at least double the impact of
existing agricultural development programs to help farmers, producers,
and rural families increase their incomes and reach millions of children
and adults with nutrition programs addressing hunger, micronutrient
deficiency, and diet-related chronic diseases. Indeed, these goals are
interlinked. [Even with rapid urbanization, the majority of the world's
food insecure and malnourished people still live in rural areas, and
most depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. Holistic
approaches]{.underline} to agricultural development and nutrition
programs [can help farmers boost their incomes through the production of
nutritious foods]{.underline}, for example, while also helping to ensure
the nutrition of their families and communities. To accomplish these
goals, [the administration must work closely with Congress to secure
**adequate US budget outlays** for food and nutrition security and
related long-term agriculture]{.underline} and nutrition programs.
Moreover, when the Global Food Security Act is due for reauthorization
in 2018, Congress should continue to lead legislatively by committing to
a long-term or permanent authorization of global food and nutrition
security efforts to ensure stability of programming and to set long-term
food security and nutrition goals. The administration can also draw from
the expertise and know-how of a broad American coalition of
private-sector partners, the agricultural community, philanthropists,
universities, and civil society organizations who are interested in and
working on food security and nutrition issues. Strategic investments by
the US government have the power to unlock a tremendous amount of
private-sector investment in food and agriculture, both at home and
abroad.

### 2NC -- Food Insecurity Impact

#### Food insecurity is the [principle cause]{.underline} of war

**Koren and Bagozzi 16** - PhD Candidate in Political Science at U
Minnesota; Bagozzi Assistant Professor of Political Science &
International Relations at U Delaware (Ore and Benjamin, 9/15/16 "From
global to local, food insecurity is associated with contemporary armed
conflicts," *Food Security*, DOI 10.1007/s12571-016-0610-x, Available
online at

Note that these arguments do not posit that cropland -- in and of itself
-- is at a higher risk for conflict. The onset of violence, as mentioned
above, is the result of many different conditions: political (Buhaug
2010 ; Fearon and Laitin 2003 ), economic (Hegre and Sambanis 2006 ;
Collier and Hoeffler 2005 ), and social (Scheffran et al. 2012 ).
Rather, it posits that [within conflict prone regions and countries,
areas with more access to food]{.underline}, or cropland, [but less food
availability]{.underline} per capita, may **[experience more
conflict]{.underline}**, [all else equal]{.underline}. A variety of
factors, ranging from political structures to economic development to
better infrastructure and technology, distinguish the agricultural
countryside of Iowa or northern France from that of the Sahel or
northern India. The primary models discussed below employ different
control variables to account for these different issues. In addition,
[several robustness models]{.underline} ([report]{.underline}ed in
Tables S1 and S2 in the Robustness Section) further account for the
potential that advanced indus- trialized democracies are effectively B
immune \^ to (civil) war by treating such cases as B zero-inflated \^
and estimating this propensity alongside the primary relationships of
interest, or estimating only [regions]{.underline} that [might be more
prone to experiencing (climate change related) conflict]{.underline}.
The argument developed here complements current theories by
[underscoring the]{.underline} [**independent effect of food insecurity
on conflict**. Increased access to food resources gives belligerents
increased opportunity for confrontation]{.underline}, [while decreased
availability gives them the willingness to fight over these
resources]{.underline}. [A better understanding of]{.underline} these
[violent dynamics]{.underline} [can be achieved by highlighting the high
premium]{.underline} **[armed actors]{.underline}** [place
on]{.underline} **[securing food resources]{.underline}**, which
[suggests]{.underline} -- [[if]{.mark} **[current]{.mark} food security
[trends]{.mark}** [are correct]{.mark}]{.underline} (FAO 2008 ; Barrett
2010 ) -- that [[we will see an increase in armed conflict related to
food resources]{.underline}]{.mark}. The argument developed here
accordingly suggests the following two hypotheses: H1: [Higher
demand]{.underline}, i.e. more access to food resources, [increases the
likelihood of (civil) conflict]{.underline}. H2: **[[Higher
supply]{.underline}]{.mark}**, i.e. more availability of food per person
within areas that offer access to food, [**[decreases the likelihood
of]{.mark}** (civil) **[conflict]{.mark}** relationship between food
insecurity]{.underline} on one hand, [and]{.underline} the occurrence
and persistence of [social conflict]{.underline} on the other. What do
these findings imply about the effect of food insecurity and conflict?
Naturally, even the most detailed and elaborate models are simplistic,
especially when containing as diverse a range of observations as those
examined above. Nevertheless, in terms of conditional probabilities,
[all [models show a]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[statistically
significant]{.underline}]{.mark}** first difference [[change
of]{.underline}]{.mark} approximately **[[+92 %
in]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the]{.underline} **[[probability]{.mark} of
conflict]{.underline}** when a high risk scenario is simulated for an
average cell. 4 The conditional probabilities discussed above highlight
the inherent complexity of social systems, as a phenomenon as notable as
violent conflict ultimately arises due to a variety of stressors.
Therefore, it should be emphasized that the above findings should not be
interpreted as explaining conflict onset. [Conflict can erupt due to
various]{.underline} [political]{.underline} (Buhaug 2010 ; Fearon and
Laitin 2003 ) [or economic]{.underline} (Hegre and Sambanis 2006 ;
Collier and Hoeffler 2005 )[reasons]{.underline} -- which may or may not
be related to food insecurity -- that are beyond the scope of this
paper. Rather, the present study more simply suggests that [political
violence will have a higher likelihood of concentrating in regions that
(i) offer more access to food]{.underline} resources [and]{.underline}
(ii) [face]{.underline} [low levels of]{.underline} food
[availability]{.underline} within areas that offer some access to food
resources. This study adopts an economic perspective on food security to
explain this variation in the concentration of social conflict. [From
the demand side, [violent conflict is]{.mark} most [likely to
revolve]{.mark} primarily [around access to food
sources]{.mark}]{.underline}. When [food insecurity]{.underline}
produces higher demands for food, these demands **[will directly compel
groups]{.underline}** and individuals **[to seek out and fight over
existing food resources]{.underline}**, rather than leading these actors
to pursue and fight over geographic areas that lack any (or have very
little) agricultural resources. Thus, access to croplands and food is a
necessary condition for food insecurity-induced conflict, which is
confirmed in the crop- land analyses presented here. From the supply
side, and within those areas that do already offer access to agriculture
and/or food, conflict is most likely to occur in regions that offer
lower levels of food availability, or insufficient food supplies. This
is because lower food availability (or supplies) in these contexts
directly implies higher levels of resource scarcity, which can engender
social grievances, and ultimately, social and political conflict
(Brinkman and Hendrix 2011 ; Hendrix and Brinkman 2013 ). More broadly,
**[[several causal mechanisms]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[could]{.underline}]{.mark} plausibly **[[link food security and social
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For one, [conflict in regions
with]{.underline} higher food access and [low]{.underline}er
[availability]{.underline} [might arise as a]{.underline} **[principal
outcome]{.underline}** [of food insecurity]{.underline}. This approach
is most directly in tune with the body of research concerned with the
resource scarcity-based security implications of climate change (e.g.
Miguel et al. 2004 ; Burke et al. 2009 ;O ' Loughlin et al. 2012 ), as
well as with broader studies of conflict dynamics and food security in
both rural and urban contexts (Brinkman and Hendrix 2011 ; Hendrix and
Brinkman 2013 ; Messer and Cohen 2006 ). From this perspective,
individuals and groups actively fight with one another due to food
insecurity-induced grievances, which may manifest in groups ' attempts
to overthrow existing political structures, or in these actors ' efforts
to more directly seize and control available (but scarce) agricultural
resources in an effort to better guarantee long-term food security for
their constituents. If future global projections for population growth,
consumption, and climate change hold true, then these dynamics suggest
that incidences of violent conflict over food scarcity and food
insecurity may increase as individuals and groups fight over a
continuously shrinking pool of resources, including food. A second
mechanism involves the existence of logistic support in conflict-prone
regions, or lack thereof. Throughout history and well into the
nineteenth century, armies living off the land have been a regular
character- istic of warfare. The utilization of motorized transport
vehicles and airlifts has significantly reduced the need of modern
militaries to rely on local populations for sup- port, at least among
modernized, highly technological militaries (Kress 2002,12 -- 13).
However, given the bu- reaucratic and economic capabilities required to
maintain such systems, the majority of state and non-state armed groups
in the developing world are still unlikely to be supported by
well-developed logistic supply chains (Henk and Rupiya 2001). Taking
into account the con- sistent relationship between economic welfare and
con- flict (Hegre and Sambanis 2006 ; Fearon and Laitin 2003),
unsupported warring groups on all sides of a conflict may move into
regions that offer more access to cropland in order to forage and
pillage to support them- selves, which in turn produces higher
incidences of hostilities, especially if there is not much food per
person available within these fertile regions. Hence, violent conflict
in this case is not the direct result of food insecurity, but rather is
shaped by food insecurity concerns. [[The]{.underline}]{.mark}
identified [[relationships between]{.mark} [food]{.mark} [security and
conflict are]{.mark} **[robust]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[across]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[numerous alternative]{.mark} model
[spec]{.mark}]{.underline}**ification**[[s]{.mark},]{.underline}** [[and
imply an]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[independent effect of food insecurity
in shaping conflict]{.mark} dynamics and conflict risk]{.underline}**.
[Especially when considered alongside current]{.underline}, [and
projected]{.underline}, **[climatic]{.underline}** [and
political-economic]{.underline} **[conditions]{.underline}**, this
linkage suggests that [countries could see an increase in localized
conflict **worldwide** in the coming years]{.underline}. However, this
anticipated trend should be considered with caution for several key
reasons.

#### Impact defense doesn't apply\-\--it's based on [historical examples]{.underline} that had [supply cushions]{.underline}\-\--that's no longer true, especially without ag R and D

[Ever since agriculture began, carryover stocks of grain have been the
most basic indicator of food security]{.underline}. The goal of farmers
everywhere is to produce enough grain not just to make it to the next
harvest but to do so with a comfortable margin. [From 1986, when we lost
the idled cropland buffer, through 2001, the annual world carryover
stocks of grain averaged a comfortable 107 days of
consumption]{.underline}. This safety cushion was not to last either.
[After 2001, the carryover stocks of grain dropped sharply]{.underline}
as world consumption exceeded production. From 2002 through 2011, they
averaged only 74 days of consumption, a drop of one third. An
unprecedented period of world food security has come to an end. [Within
two decades, the world had lost both of its safety
cushions]{.underline}. [In recent years, world carryover stocks of grain
have been only slightly above the 70 days]{.underline} that was
considered a desirable minimum during the late twentieth century. [Now
stock levels must take into account the effect on harvests of higher
temperatures, more extensive drought, and more intense heat
waves]{.underline}. Although there is no easy way to precisely quantify
the harvest effects of any of these climate-related threats, it is clear
that any of them can shrink harvests, potentially creating chaos in the
world grain market. To mitigate this risk, a stock reserve equal to 110
days of consumption would produce a much safer level of food security.
[The world is now living from one year to the next]{.underline},
**[hoping always to produce enough to cover]{.underline}** the growth in
**[demand]{.underline}**. [Farmers everywhere are making an all-out
effort to keep pace with the accelerated growth in demand]{.underline},
but they are having difficulty doing so. [Food shortages undermined
earlier civilizations]{.underline}. The Sumerians and Mayans are just
two of the many early civilizations that declined apparently because
they moved onto an agricultural path that was environmentally
unsustainable. For the Sumerians, rising salt levels in the soil as a
result of a defect in their otherwise well-engineered irrigation system
eventually brought down their food system and thus their civilization.
For the Mayans, soil erosion was one of the keys to their downfall, as
it was for so many other early civilizations. [We, too, are on such a
path]{.underline}. While the Sumerians suffered from rising salt levels
in the soil, our modern-day agriculture is suffering from rising carbon
dioxide levels in the atmosphere. And like the Mayans, we too are
mismanaging our land and generating record losses of soil from erosion.
While the decline of early civilizations can be traced to one or
possibly two environmental trends such as deforestation and soil erosion
that undermined their food supply, we are now dealing with several. In
addition to some of the most severe soil erosion in human history, we
are also facing newer trends such as the depletion of aquifers, the
plateauing of grain yields in the more agriculturally advanced
countries, and rising temperature. Against this backdrop, it is not
surprising that the United Nations reports that food prices are now
double what they were in 2002--04. For most Americans, who spend on
average 9 percent of their income on food, this is not a big deal. But
for consumers who spend 50--70 percent of their income on food, a
[doubling of food prices is a serious matter. There is little latitude
for them to offset the price rise simply by spending more]{.underline}.
[Closely associated with the decline in stocks of grain and the rise in
food prices is the spread of hunger]{.underline}. During the closing
decades of the last century, the number of hungry people in the world
was falling, dropping to a low of 792 million in 1997. After that it
began to rise, climbing toward 1 billion. Unfortunately, if we continue
with business as usual, the ranks of the hungry will continue to expand.
The bottom line is that [it is becoming much more difficult for the
world's farmers to keep up with the world's rapidly growing demand for
grain]{.underline}. [World grain stocks were drawn down a decade ago and
we have not been able to rebuild them. If we cannot do so, we can expect
that with the next poor harvest, food prices will soar, hunger will
intensify, and **food unrest will spread**]{.underline}. [We are
entering a time of chronic food scarcity, one that is leading to intense
competition for control of land and water resources---in short, a new
geopolitics of food]{.underline}.

**nuclear power Iran**.]{.underline} The heated [economic and diplomatic

which create incubators for extremist and anti-American government

and comprehensive]{.underline} National Security Strategy combining all
elements of National Power [including a **Food Security
Strategy**]{.underline}.¶ An American [Food Security]{.underline}
Strategy [is an **imperative factor**]{.underline} [in reducing the
multiple threats impacting our]{.underline} National
[wellbeing]{.underline}. [Recent history has shown that reliable food
supplies and stable prices produce more stable and secure
countries]{.underline}. [Conversely, food insecurity]{.underline},
particularly in poorer countries, [can lead to **instability**, unrest,
and **violence**]{.underline}.¶ [Food insecurity drives **mass
migration** around the world from the Middle East, to Africa, to
Southeast Asia, destabilizing neighboring populations, generating
**conflicts**, and threatening our own security]{.underline} [by
disrupting our economic, military, and diplomatic
**relations**hips]{.underline}. [Food system shocks]{.underline} from
extreme food-price volatility [can be correlated with protests and
riots]{.underline}. [Food price related protests toppled governments in
Haiti and Madagascar in 2007 and 2008.]{.underline} In 2010 and in 2011,
[food prices and grievances related to food policy were one of the major
drivers of the Arab Spring uprisings.]{.underline} [Repeatedly, history
has taught us that a **strong agricultural sector**]{.underline} [is an
unquestionable **requirement** for inclusive and sustainable
growth]{.underline}, broad-based development progress, [and long-term
stability.]{.underline}¶ The impact can be remarkable and far reaching.
[Rising income, in addition to reducing the opportunities for an upsurge
in extremism, leads to changes in diet, producing demand for more
diverse and nutritious foods provided]{.underline}, in many cases, [from
American farmers and ranchers.]{.underline} [Emerging
markets]{.underline} currently [purchase 20 percent of U.S.
**ag**riculture exports and that figure is expected to grow as
populations boom.]{.underline}¶ Moving early to ensure stability in
strategically significant regions requires long term planning and a
disciplined, thoughtful strategy. To combat current threats and work to
prevent future ones, our national leadership must employ the entire
spectrum of our power including diplomatic, economic, and cultural
elements. The best means to prevent future chaos and the resulting
instability is positive engagement addressing the causes of instability
before it occurs.¶ This is not rocket science. We know where the
instability is most likely to occur. [The world population will grow by
2.5 billion people by 2050. Unfortunately, this massive population boom
is projected to occur primarily in the most fragile and food insecure
countries]{.underline}. This alarming math is not just about total
numbers. [Projections show that the greatest increase is in the age
groups most vulnerable to extremism]{.underline}. There are currently
200 million people in Africa between the ages of 15 and 24, with that
number expected to double in the next 30 years. Already, 60% of the
unemployed in Africa are young people. ¶ [Too often these situations
deteriorate into **shooting wars** requiring the deployment
of]{.underline} our [military forces]{.underline}. We should be
continually mindful that the price we pay for committing military forces
is measured in our most precious national resource, the blood of those
who serve. For those who live in rural America, this has a
disproportionate impact. Fully 40% of those who serve in our military
come from the farms, ranches, and non-urban communities that make up

#### Syria proves the link between food insecurity and conflict.

@ AG

In 2015 the Welsh singer and activist Charlotte Church was widely
ridiculed in the right-wing press and on social media for saying on BBC
Question Time that climate change had played an important part in
causing the conflict in Syria. From 2006 until 2011, \[Syria\]
experienced one of the worst droughts in its history, which of course
meant that there were water shortages and crops weren't growing, so
there was mass migration from rural areas of Syria into the urban
centres, which put on more strain, and made resources scarce etc, which
apparently contributed to the conflict there today. But what she said
was correct -- and [there will be an increasing convergence
of]{.underline} climate, **[food, economic and political
crises]{.underline}** [in the coming years and decades. We need to
better understand the interconnectivity of environmental, economic,
geopolitical, societal and technological systems if we are to manage
these crises]{.underline} and avoid their worst impacts. In particular,
[tipping points exist in both physical and socio-economic
systems,]{.underline} including governmental or financial systems. These
systems interact in complex ways. [Small shocks may have little impact
but, a particular shock or set of shocks could tip the system into a new
state]{.underline}. [**This new state could represent a collapse in
agriculture** or even the fall of a government]{.underline}. In 2011,
[Syria became the latest country to experience disruption in a wave of
political unrest crossing]{.underline} North Africa and [the Middle
Eas]{.underline}t. Religious differences, a failure of the ruling regime
to tackle unemployment and social injustice and the state of human
rights all contributed to a backdrop of social unrest. However, these
pressures had existed for years, if not decades. So [was there a trigger
for the conflict]{.underline} in the region which worked in tandem with
the ongoing social unrest? [Syria, and the surrounding region, has
experienced **significant depletion in water availability**]{.underline}
since 2003. In particular [an intense drought]{.underline} between 2007
and 2010, alongside poor water management**[, saw agricultural
production collapse]{.underline}** [and a mass migration from rural
areas to city]{.underline} centres. [Farmers]{.underline}, who had been
relatively wealthy in their rural surroundings [now found themselves as
the urban poor reliant]{.underline} on food imports. Between 2007 and
2009 Syria increased its annual imports of wheat and meslin (rice flour)
by about 1.5m tonnes. That equated to a more than ten-fold increase in
importing one of the most basic foods. Complex system There is a
tendency these days to believe that global trade will protect the world
from food production shocks. A small production shock in one region can
be mitigated by increasing, temporarily, imports of food or by sourcing
food from another region. However, [certain shocks]{.underline}, or a
set of shocks, [could create an amplifying feedback that cascades into a
globally significant event]{.underline}. The food system today is
increasingly complex and an impact in land, water, labour or
infrastructure could create fragility. [A large enough perturbation can
lead to a price response in the global market that sends a signal to
other producers to increase their output to make up for any
shortfall.]{.underline} While increased prices can be beneficial to
farmers and food producers, [if the price increase is large enough it
can have a significant impact on communities that are net food
importers. Additionally, food production is concentrated both in a
relatively small handful of commodity crops]{.underline} such as wheat,
rice and maize as well as from a relatively small number of regions, for
example the US, China and Russia. [This concentration means any
disruption in those regions will have a **large impact on global food
supply**]{.underline}. Reliance on global markets for sourcing food can
therefore be a source of systemic risk. Rising prices In 2008 the global
price of food increased dramatically. This increase was the result of a
complex set of issues including historically low global food stocks,
drought in Australia following production lows in several other areas
over the previous few years, and speculation and an increase in biofuel
production in North America. Cereals Price Index (indexed at 100 in
2006). FAO Food Price Index, Author provided This spike in global food
price in 2008 was a factor in the initial unrest across North Africa and
the Middle East, which became known as [the Arab Spring. As prices
peaked, violence broke out in countries such as Egypt, Libya and
Tunisia. In Syria a local drought which coincided with this global shock
in food price]{.underline}s resulted in dramatic changes in the
availability and cost of food. In response small groups of individuals
protested. The government response, combined with a background of rising
protests, existing social tensions and instability in the wider region,
quickly escalated into the situation we are experiencing today. [The
events in Syria, then, appear to stem from]{.underline} a far more
complex set of pressures, beyond religious tension and government
brutality, with its roots in the availability of a natural resource --
water -- and its impact on [**food production**. This is]{.underline}
worrying as decreasing water availability is far from a localised issue
-- it **[is a systemic risk across the Middle East and North
Africa]{.underline}**. Over the coming decades this water security
challenge is likely to be further exacerbated by climate change. To
better manage these types of risks in the future, and to build societal
resilience, the world needs to understand our society's interdependence
on natural resources and how this can lead to events such as those that
unfolded in Syria. [We need analytical, statistical, scenario or war
game-type models to explore different possible futures and policy
strategies for mitigating the risk. By understanding sources of
political instability we hope to get a better handle on how these types
of crisis arise.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- Morality

#### Addressing food inequality is a moral imperative.

Madeleine **Albright** 07-29-20**15** -- Former Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright is co-chair of the Aspen Food Security Strategy
Group. \["Global Food Security Is a Moral Imperative," Accessible Online

https://ourworld.unu.edu/en/global-food-security-is-a-moral-imperative\]
@ AG

It is peculiar to live in a world where hunger is an endemic problem for
half the planet while diet books are best sellers in the other half.
This point is often lost in the broader bundle of jargon that now
defines the conversation on food security in the 21st century, but it
should not be. A food security expert today will tell you that in order
to feed the world's population, projected to reach over 9 billion people
by 2050, we must adopt a sophisticated strategy of "streamlining market
efficiencies", "scaling best practices" and "leveraging disruptive
technologies" to put food in the mouths of the poor and the hungry.
True. But there is more to this story. In reality, food insecurity
predates public-private partnerships and market-driven solutions by
several millennia, and the essence of the issue remains unchanged. Even
in the 21st century, [chronic hunger and malnutrition are propagated by
two forces: **inequality and injustice**]{.underline}. This means that
[food security is]{.underline} as much **[a moral]{.underline}** and
political **[issue]{.underline}** as it is one defined by markets and
international agreements. Accordingly, [**we have an obligation** to
make the case for plugging the gaps in the global food
system]{.underline} --- not only because of how it will benefit economic
growth and political stability but also **[because it is the right thing
to do]{.underline}**. It is therefore time for a clear-eyed moral
framework for reaching food security. [This means building support among
core participants]{.underline} --- governments, the private sector,
non-governmental organizations and international institutions --- [for
the principle that feeding the world's growing population **is an end in
itself** and not merely a means]{.underline} to other ends. [Generating
returns on investment]{.underline}, exploring new markets and protecting
the world's resources are important benefits that will come from working
toward food security. But they [are **small part of a greater moral
good** that should remain the fundamental principle of food
security.]{.underline} What does this principle look like in practice?
Food is about agriculture; agriculture is about land and water; and land
and water are about property --- who owns it, who has access to it, and
who cultivates it. [Government is first and foremost **a social
contract** that outlines responsibilities for order and well-being
between those **who rule and those who are ruled**]{.underline}. I
therefore believe that [governments have a responsibility to feed those
who cannot feed themselves]{.underline}. But we must better understand
what tools governments can use to achieve that objective. First,
property is everywhere in this discussion, and governments have the
power to define the legal architecture of property rights.. As the
economist Hernando de Soto has pointed out brilliantly, if we can do a
better job of making property rights accessible to all, we can also help
the poor to use those rights to obtain credit, make investments and
increase their agricultural output. Property rights give poor people a
stronger voice and a greater stake in their economies. We cannot expect
to increase the agricultural output of the world's arable land if the
smallholder farmers responsible for its cultivation are not invested in
its future. Second[, as the providers of social services, governments
are in a unique position to structure how issues such as nutrition,
agriculture and infrastructure intersect with welfare and social
service]{.underline}s. One of the resounding lessons from the work of
the Food Security Strategy Group at the Aspen Institute is that an
integrated approach for reducing food insecurity has a greater impact
than separate strategies for each sector. [Ethiopia has demonstrated the
wisdom of]{.underline} such an [integrated strategy]{.underline} in its
Agricultural Transformation Agency, a forward-thinking agency [designed
to reduce food insecurity by mandating collaboration]{.underline}
between key government ministries and finance, agriculture, health,
relief and social services. The success of this model is evident in the
fact that since the strategy's implementation, Ethiopia has made greater
gains toward food security (as measured by the Economist Intelligence
Unit's Global Food Security Index, which is sponsored by DuPont) than
any other country. Third, governments have the power and responsibility
to create clear regulatory environments to accelerate technologies that
support the safe and sustainable increase of agricultural production.
One important opportunity will come later this year, when the United
Nations sets out its post-2015 development goals. Part of the discussion
about the proper role of the U.N. in food security should include
whether we **[consider access to food a human right]{.underline}**.
Importantly, this could help reframe the debate on hot-button moral
issues such as agricultural subsidies and genetically modified seed. [As
the guardians of social order and justice, governments have a compelling
moral responsibility to lead the way toward a more food-secure
future.]{.underline} The Green Revolution and its modern-day
counterparts have saved countless lives. Yet [there are countries with
starving populations]{.underline} that for a variety of reasons have
decided they will not use any crops that have been exposed to GMOs or
are themselves genetically modified. Consensus in the scientific
community supports the position that GM crops increase yields and do not
pose a threat to human health. While this position could shift, until
that happens **[we have a moral imperative]{.underline}** [to use these
agricultural innovations to decrease hunger and increase profits for
farmers in the developing world]{.underline}. Only governments have the
authority to drive evidence-based policy reforms that decrease hunger,
enhance nutrition and support innovation. From the legal architecture of
land and water rights to the provision of social services and the power
to shape and accelerate high-impact technologies, governments possess
considerable tools to deploy in the global effort to fight food
insecurity. Moreover, as the guardians of social order and justice,
governments have a compelling moral responsibility to lead the way
toward a more food-secure future. But government can't do this alone.
Governments are not omnipotent, nor do they possess infinite resources.
The two sectors best positioned to complement the tools and capabilities
of governments are the private sector and what we may consider the
"spiritual" sector or global religions. Businesses, of course, have the
greatest stake in achieving a food-secure future. And it is here where
the moral underpinning of food security becomes particularly important.
Businesses, including large multinational agriculture companies, stand
to gain a great deal in the markets that now exemplify the most endemic
and vexing challenges of food insecurity. Yet the path to profitability
in those regions is not always confluent with the long-term
sustainability and welfare of the most vulnerable communities. These are
the voices of religious authority --- from the pope to imams, and
everyone in between --- who have the power to spur broad-based action on
agriculture and nutrition to help the poor and malnourished. [Businesses
have a responsibility to share the burden: to do well by doing
good]{.underline}. In the agriculture sector, this means making a
commitment to developing resources and human capital at a community
level so that smallholder farmers, who are mostly women, share the
profits of the global rise in agriculture yields by having fair access
to water, land and fertilizers. Even with the public, private and
nonprofit sectors fully engaged, it's in our interests to recognize that
another set of voices can mobilize grassroots action on an issue such as
food security in a way no other organizations can. These are the voices
of religious authority --- from the pope to imams, and everyone in
between --- who have the power to spur broad-based action on agriculture
and nutrition to help the poor and malnourished. Notably, Pope Francis
and his deputy, Cardinal Peter Turkson, have been outspoken on this
issue, with Pope Francis going so far as to call it a "God-given right
of everyone to have access to adequate food." Moreover, they have
mobilized the \[Catholic\] Church's development arm, Caritas
Internationalis, in a global campaign to end hunger by 2025 by
leveraging, for the first time, the worldwide footprint of Caritas
Internationalis and its affiliated organizations to present a unified
call for systemic change in the global food system. The pope's voice and
action on this issue, as evidenced by his strong endorsement of the Rome
Declaration on Nutrition andFramework for Action, exemplifies how
religious leaders can use their gravitas and authority to galvanize
support for public sector--led initiatives. Meeting the complex
challenge of achieving food security by mid-century mandates new
thinking and action. Yes, [it requires "dynamic partnerships", "models
for scalable impact" and "disruptive technologies",]{.underline} along
with a host of other ingredients that would be dizzying to list. But the
real challenge is to use the core competencies of each sector to pursue
a common goal. Businesses make money --- they must find it in their
interests to grow in a way that leaves the poor and malnourished better
off in the areas in which they work. Governments make laws and uphold
order --- they must see protecting the poor and malnourished as
fundamental to social and political stability over the long term.
Religions and other NGOs --- such as those focused on empowering women
--- can share compelling narratives and motivate people to give back,
cut back and reduce food waste. In a world where one-third of all edible
food never makes it to the mouths of the hungry, [we all have an
individual moral responsibility to do our part.]{.underline} The
imperative to support those in need is the idea --- the larger framework
--- that unites each of these sectors in achieving food security. [We
should embrace this sense of shared purpose.]{.underline}

#### Ending hunger is an ethical obligation

**Borgen** Project 20**14** -- The Borgen Project is a nonprofit
organization that is addressing poverty and hunger and working towards
ending them. \[\"The Effects of Hunger,\" Accessible Online at:
https://borgenproject.org/effects-hunger/\] @ AG

Everyone knows the feeling of an uncomfortable stomachache[. If a person
misses a single meal]{.underline} for one reason or another, [he or she
can feel the effect it has on mood, ability to concentrate and sometimes
ability to even think straight]{.underline}. Thus, people try to avoid
this feeling as much as possible, but [what if one had no other choice
but to be hungry]{.underline}? Unfortunately, **[this is the reality
that millions of people live with every day of their
lives.]{.underline}** According to the U.N., [about 870 million people
suffer from hunger, meaning one in eight people are hungry globally.
Hunger has **serious effects on the entire body,** and extreme hunger
only serves to **continue the cycle of poverty.**]{.underline} Although
hunger is normally a feeling associated with the stomach, [hunger also
directly affects the brain in several ways]{.underline}. Due to the lack
of essential nutrients, vitamins, protein and minerals,
[severe]{.underline} and continuous [hunger can inhibit the brain from
developing cognitively, socially and emotionally, all of which affect an
individual's ability to read, concentrate, memorize and even speak.
Other key organs are also directly affected by hunger. Impaired vision
and other eyesight issues result]{.underline} from a lack of Vitamin A,
[and the gums and teeth can become damaged]{.underline} due to calcium
deficiency. Possibly even worse is the effect that extreme hunger has on
the immune system. [If the immune system lacks basic vitamins, nutrients
and minerals, then it **cannot properly defend the body against
disease**,]{.underline} which is why developing countries are constantly
battling a variety of diseases. As mentioned above, hunger can make it
difficult to study and learn, which is why extreme poverty and hunger
are often related to a lack of proper education. Especially in
developing countries, children who experience hunger from a very young
age tend to struggle academically and have a lower IQ when compared to
the academic performance of well-nourished children. Although all
children should have access to nourishment, [it is critical that
newborns and infants receive the necessary nutrients]{.underline}.
According to 30 Hour Famine, **[70 percent of the brain]{.underline}**
[develops during the first two years of life alone. If]{.underline}
young [children experience malnourishment]{.underline}, especially
during that time frame, **[the brain could become damaged
forever]{.underline}**. [The effects of hunger and
malnutrition]{.underline} are not only damaging, but
**[can]{.underline}** also **[be irreparable]{.underline}**. [Aside from
a lack of comfort, hunger also causes **serious health issues,** which
is why ensuring that everyone,]{.underline} especially those in
developing countries, [has access to the necessary nutrients they need
to live a long and healthy life is such a critical issue.]{.underline}

### [2NC -- T/ Middle East]{.underline}

#### Food insecurity in the Middle East is a driving force of conflict.

Josh **Martinez** 7-31-20**18** -- Journalist and researcher citing
studies and experts from the Middle East Institute. \["Is Food Security
a Problem in the Middle East?," Accessible Online at:

@ AG

Certain [countries in the Middle East have long dealt with a **lack of
food security**]{.underline}. The immense conflict and import dependence
in the region means that this problem is now growing. [Undernourishment,
malnutrition and anemia are consistent issues]{.underline} in the Middle
East. [Millions have to deal with the harsh realities of **unsustainable
farming and famine.**]{.underline} In general, [food
insecurity]{.underline} isn't a new development for the Middle East. But
it [**could grow even worse if steps aren't taken** to change
agricultural policies with the health needs of the people]{.underline}.
Coverage in The Lancet of the joint OECD-FAO (the Organization for
Economic Co-operation and Development and the United Nations' Food and
Agriculture Organization) Agricultural Outlook 2018-2027 report
highlights the problem. Constant turmoil in the Middle East appears to
be a source of the issue. [Yemen, Iraq, Sudan, Libya, Syria, Nigeria and
Somalia are some of the countries filled with constant strife. It's no
coincidence that **these countries are either experiencing famines or at
risk for them**]{.underline}. [Itt Thirarath of the **Middle East
Institute** points out]{.underline} that in times of war, food security
is rarely a big priority, although it should be. He points out that
[food security has **long been a source of conflict** in the
region]{.underline}. ["In a region where a great proportion of the land
is arid and unsuitable for food production, and whose sources of food
precariously depend on imports from abroad, the issue of food security
is of utmost gravity]{.underline}," said Thirarath. [Disputes can divide
the people of the Middle East. It can cause many to become homeless or
increase the number of households in poverty. Agricultural suppliers may
be cut off during a regional conflict. Rural communities are often hit
the hardest]{.underline} by the violent event. Production and sources of
food can be scarce in these times. That said, aggression doesn't appear
to be the only cause of these dire circumstances. In 2015, about 777
million people around the world suffered from undernourishment. By 2016,
that number increased to 815 million people. The OECD-FAO Outlook
describes the Middle East and north Africa as prime examples of areas
that will become increasingly reliant on imports. The cause appears to
be, "limited natural resources, slow production expansion and high
population growth." Much of the land in these locations is not properly
suitable for agriculture. The process gets even more difficult with
consistent water problems. A major recommendation in the study is to
limit the constant use of arable land for cereals. The product requires
tremendous water to grow and does not lead to a diverse diet. The
undernourishment and unsustainable problems aren't the region's only
health problems. From 1980 to 2013, the Middle East showed the greatest
growth in obesity. This problem is affecting both adults and children in
the area. Stunted growth of children under age five, wasting and
non-communicable diseases also plague the region. A range of other
similar issues also continue to increase food insecurity throughout the
Middle East. Travelers should know that food insecurity could be
prevalent in their destination. This can mean expensive food, lack of
food, poverty and political turmoil. At the very least, travelers may be
stuck with a diet that won't be varied and nutritionally beneficial.
While it certainly does not affect travelers so much as the people who
actually live there, [food security in the Middle East is a
problem.]{.underline}

@ AG

Food insecurity continues to rise across the globe due to market
disruptions, production, declining purchasing power, resource
mismanagement, and poor government policies. The current U.S.
administration has harshly criticized the use of foreign aid and
advocated for large cuts in U.S. aid assistance to developing countries.
These [proposed cuts in foreign aid will result in **stark
consequences** on global food security. Food security has not been at
the center of the conversation as to **why terrorism
exists.**]{.underline} However, this matter will continue to be a
critical issue for the United States as a national security concern.
Although there is still much uncertainty regarding the current
government's policies toward terrorism, it is safe to assume that it
will take a stronger approach to the issue. With that in mind, [it is
incredibly important to understand the correlation between **food
insecurity and terrorism**]{.underline}. Research conducted by [the New
England Complex Systems Institute contends that **price spikes in food
and civil unrest are correlated**.]{.underline} [Examples]{.underline}
of this [can be seen throughout history]{.underline}. Most recently in
2011, [the]{.underline} Algerian and Tunisian **[Arab
Spring]{.underline}** [came to fruition]{.underline} partially [due to
the dramatic price increases]{.underline} in sugar, oil, and flour.
**[Terrorist organizations]{.underline}** [like al-Qaeda, Hezbollah,
Hamas, and ISIL among others, have **used food insecurity to recruit**
and promote their political objectives.]{.underline} Notably, [ISIL was
recently seen **redistributing food** aid in Iraq]{.underline} from
several humanitarian organizations [**to gain trust** from local
populations. Conflicts involving food insecurity provides a ripe
opportunity for the emergence of extremist groups to arise in these
vulnerable areas]{.underline}. In another study conducted by the [World
Food Program]{.underline}, they [found]{.underline} that "[food
insecurity ... heightens the risk of **democratic breakdown**, **civil
conflict**, **protest**, **rioting**, and **communal
conflict**]{.underline}." The study does point out that food insecurity
alone is never the sole cause of conflict. There are numerous other
factors like the existence of insufficient political institutions,
social safety nets, and a lack of economic development that are required
to make the "perfect storm" for conflict. Additionally, [violent
conflict of any sort can result in higher food prices and food shortages
for local populations; creating a domino effect. As the food crisis
worsens, countries such as **Somalia, Pakistan, Syria, Nigeria, Iraq,
Libya, Lebanon, Egypt**, and many others will become more at risk to
terrorism]{.underline} and political instability. [Many]{.underline} of
these countries [already suffer from terrorism]{.underline} and corrupt
governance **[making them more vulnerable]{.underline}** as the
situation continues to deteriorate. More broadly, [the lack of access to
critical resources like food and water]{.underline} [can lead to civil
unrest]{.underline} not only [in]{.underline} developing or unstable
countries but [countries that are of strategic importance to the
U.S]{.underline}., such as China and Russia. The causes for food
insecurity will continue to impact the U.S. government's counter
terrorism and national security efforts at home and abroad. [If
terrorism is a concern for the U.S. government, then **they must address
food insecurity in developing and unstable countries.**]{.underline}

## Theory

### 2NC -- Literature Base

#### An arms sales tax is [predictable]{.underline} and [grounded in the literature]{.underline}

**Brzoska 4** -- Dr., Director of Research, Bonn International Center
for Conversion (Michael, "Taxation of the global arms trade? An overview
of the issues," *Kyklos*, 57.2)//BB

[[The idea of taxing]{.mark} the international [arms]{.mark} trade
[is]{.mark} politically [attractive]{.mark}. Its [proponents have
included]{.mark} a number of [high-ranking
politicians]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as former German chancellor Willy
Brandt (Independent Commission on International Development 1980), [[as
well as influential thinkers]{.mark} on development issues]{.underline},
such as the first editor of the Human Development Report, Mahbub ul-Haq
(UNDP 1994). [The proposal to look into the possible merits of [an arms
trade tax]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[came up]{.mark} [in
the]{.mark}]{.underline} wake of the [[global summit on development
finance]{.underline}]{.mark}, held in Monterrey, Mexico, in 2002,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} it was an issue during [[the]{.underline}
[G-8]{.underline}]{.mark} Head of State [Summit in Lyon,
France]{.underline}, in June 2003. Prior to the meeting of the G-8 with
representatives from major developing countries, Brazilian president
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had declared an international arms sales tax
to be one of his favored schemes to fund efforts to eliminate hunger. At
least one of the G-8 leaders, [French president]{.underline} Jacques
[Chirac]{.underline}, [was publicly willing to contemplate]{.underline}
the suggestion to study [the proposal of taxing all arms
transfers]{.underline}, or those of firearms to private citizens
(WorldNetDaily.com, June 3, 2003). The idea of an arms trade tax first
gained international prominence when selected as one of the major
recommendations for further consideration in the 'Brandt-Report'
(Independent Commission on International Development 1980), commissioned
by World Bank president Robert McNamara. The commissioners argued that a
tax on the arms trade would have the effect of increasing the price of
arms and thereby reduce arms transfers. They argued that fewer imports
of arms would both increase the means for investment into economic
development as well as reduce the destructiveness of military conflicts.
In addition, the Commissioners also saw an opportunity to rake in income
that could be used for development purposes. The Brandt-Report's
suggestion of an arms trade tax was picked up by both non-governmental
organizations and some governments in the early 1980s. It was repeated,
for instance, in the Report by the Independent Commission on Disarmament
and Security (1982), chaired by former Swedish Prime Minister Olof
Palme. However, there was also major criticism of and opposition to the
proposal, for a variety of reasons discussed below. In the end, there
was little follow-on to the suggestion, a fate similar to the rest of
the 'Brandt-Report'. From the late 1980s, the idea of an arms trade tax
has been predominantly promoted by Oscar Arias Sanchez, former President
of Costa Rica and leader of a group of winners of the Nobel Peace Prize
interested in initiatives to reduce the trade in arms (www.armslaw.org).
Arias variously advocated to use the income gained from a substantial
tax on the arms trade to feed a development fund, or to use the money to
support disarmament activities in developing countries (Arias Sanchez
1995, 1996). Recently, a variant of an arms trade tax has been debated
within NGO circles concerned about the wide-spread suffering stemming
from the use of small arms (Graduate Institute of International Studies
2003). The German small arms researcher Peter Lock proposed to levy a
tax on ammunition exports and to require producers and traders of small
arms to pay for compulsory third party damage liability insurance (Lock
1999). The income from these levies should be used to compensate victims
of small arms use. A related suggestion for a compulsory third party
damage liability insurance was made by a 'Group of Eminent Persons' on
small arms issues chaired by former Malian President Alpha Omar Konaré
and former French Prime Minister Michel Rocard (Konaré and Rocard 2000)
[[The proposals]{.underline}]{.mark} by the Brazilian and French
presidents of June 2003 [[were]{.mark} thus [based on a **long-time
debate**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[on proposals for a]{.underline}]{.mark}n
international [[tax on arms transfers]{.mark}.]{.underline} However,
despite -- or possibly because -- of the prominence of the various
proposals, little serious thought was given during this period to
questions such as how it would work in practice, what its effects on
both arms sellers and buyers would be. The debate remained on rather
superficial levels, focusing on objectives and obvious objections to its
feasibility, such as compliance by major arms sellers.

**[Decision-making takes time and energy.]{.underline}**
[Succeeding]{.underline} at jobs with higher earning potential and
flexibility [requires you to have developed your decision-making
ability. Without]{.underline} a habit of systems and [frameworks upon
which you can rely, you'll find yourself exhausted and stressed out
after a long day of decision making.]{.underline} If you've ever gone to
the grocery store after a long day at work or studying and find yourself
overwhelmed by the options available to you, you've experienced decision
fatigue at what economists call the paradox of choice (more choices make
it harder to make a decision). When trying to compare courses of action
or opportunities, use frameworks to understand how to proceed.
Eventually, you'll slip and start making worse decisions and put your
job and work at risk. Instead, you should defer to frameworks to help
you make decisions. [When trying to compare courses of action or
opportunities, use]{.underline} frameworks to understand how to proceed.
When I talk to young people trying to decide what to major in, I
encourage them to study economics for this reason. While psychology is
billed as the science of thinking and decision-making, economics
(especially microeconomics) is the science of human action. Why did
consumers purchase product A and not product B? How would behavior
change if the price went up? What if the price went down? How would the
price change (and why) if the quantity supplied decreased or increased?
The insights from questions like these can be applied to our own lives
and to the lives of other people with whom we work. **[Opportunity
Cost]{.underline}** The first framework I teach to people I work with is
opportunity cost. Translated from academic economics jargon, [the
opportunity cost of any given action is the value that taking the
next-best option would bring.]{.underline} This is one of my favorite
frameworks for making decisions. [You can use opportunity cost as a way
to compare options for yourself, to understand the stakes at play for
others in negotiations, and to present new options]{.underline} to
potential customers. It's even a tool you can use to understand why
friends might make the decisions they do or why a date decided not to go
on a second date with you. **[Opportunity cost is the fundamental way in
which people compare between alternatives]{.underline}**. This doesn't
assume perfect knowledge or rationality, either. [People make decisions
by comparing the perceived cost of option A to that of option
B.]{.underline} Those perceptions may be objectively incorrect (people
are often bad at understanding the opportunity cost of going to school,
for example), but [clarifying and informing those perceptions is what
conversations and marking are for]{.underline}. **[Opportunity cost is
the fundamental way]{.underline}** [in which people compare between
alternatives.]{.underline} Take the simple example of trying to decide
whether to go out with friends and drink or to stay in and read for the
evening. The cost of staying in is that you don't get to see your
friends tonight and you may not meet some new people. The cost of going
out is that you may get to bed later, whatever else you could have spent
the \$20 for drinks on, and getting whatever enjoyment you could have
had from reading the book tonight. Assuming your friends don't leave
town tomorrow and your book doesn't magically disappear, the cost really
is the time going out and whatever else you could have spent the \$20
on. This is a pretty benign example but it makes clear that every
decision you make comes with a cost. Most simply, [opportunity cost is
the value of your time. You can use opportunity cost to weigh heavier
decisions than whether or not to go out.]{.underline}

### [Ag Funding Now]{.underline}

#### There's massive investment in sustainable agriculture now.

Lisa **Held** 10-24-20**17** -- Held is a New York City-based journalist
who writes about the food system and how it relates to health and
sustainability. \[\"Impact investors flock to sustainable agriculture,\"
Accessible Online at:
https://www.greenbiz.com/article/impact-investors-flock-sustainable-agriculture\]
@ AG

[**Massive venture capital investments** in food make for a **steady
stream** of]{.underline} splashy, dramatic [headlines. Juicero raises
\$120 million]{.underline}; reporters discover you can \"juice\" their
product without the help of the \$400 machine. [Hampton Creek raises
\$220 million]{.underline}; board members bolt after a series of
scandals. [Blue Apron raises \$200 millio]{.underline}n; its IPO
performs terribly. But behind this high-profile obsession with the Next
Big Thing, [a number of impact investors are also raising capital for
other types of food and agriculture projects that they believe have the
potential to fix a broken food system. A growing number of investment
companies]{.underline} in this realm [are using capital]{.underline} [to
help ranchers]{.underline} switch to 100 percent grass-fed beef
production, [connect small farms to communities with little access to
fresh food and transition farmland used to grow commodity]{.underline}
[corn and soy to organic, regenerative systems]{.underline}. \"There\'s
total momentum right now around people rethinking about how their money
is being put to work,\" said Kate Danaher, senior manager of social
enterprise lending and integrated capital at RSF Social Finance.
\"[Impact investing]{.underline} as a whole [is growing very
quickly]{.underline}, and my guess is that if you polled everyone
interested, **[the most popular sector is sustainable food and
ag]{.underline}**.\" In fact, according to the Global Impact Investing
Network\'s most recent survey (PDF), **[63 percent of impact
investors]{.underline}** [said they were putting their dollars into food
and agriculture,]{.underline} and impact investment in the sector has
grown at an annual rate of 32.5 percent since 2013. Those in the space
say capital is what sustainable agriculture needs in order to scale up.
But critics warn that the money comes with risks, when the priority is
ROI and corporate ownership of farmland becomes the norm. \"Agriculture
is a whole culture of how to work with the earth,\" said Anuradha
Mittal, executive director of the Oakland Institute, which looks
critically at land and agriculture investments around the globe. \"When
it\'s driven by profit, it can be very dangerous.\" The impact of
investment \"[The biggest bottleneck]{.underline} in a good food system
[is]{.underline} not entrepreneurs, it\'s [access to
capital,\"]{.underline} said Eric Kessler, founder of Arabella Advisors,
a company that focuses on impact investing and philanthropy, with the
food system as one of its three primary areas of focus. When he created
Arabella 12 years ago, Kessler said no one even used the term \"impact
investing.\" Over the last decade it has become a buzzword, however, and
financial services companies are applying many models to all segments of
the food system. In May, the Croatan Institute published the most
comprehensive report on the sector to date. The 40-page Impact Investing
in Sustainable Food and Agriculture Across Asset Classes (PDF) is packed
with examples of how \"[conventional asset classes such as cash, fixed
income and public equity\" and \"alternatives such as private equity,
venture capital and real assets\" are poised to make a positive
impact]{.underline} in the space. Just as in traditional investment,
[financial services organizations take varied approaches, from loans to
public equity to funds that make direct investments in farmland, and
apply a hands-on approach to how money is managed.]{.underline} One
common approach is setting up program-related investments (PRIs), which
allow private foundations to invest in mission-aligned projects that
generate returns.

### Food Turn

#### Food security fuels rebel groups and encourages recruitment.

Ore **Koren** 11-23-20**16** -- Koren is a PhD candidate at the
University of Minnesota and a Jennings Randolph Fellow at the United
States Institute of Peace. \[\"Food scarcity causes conflicts --- but so
can food abundance. Here's why.,\" Accessible Online at:
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/11/23/food-scarcity-causes-conflicts-but-so-does-food-abundance-heres-why/\]
@ AG

**[How can an abundance of food lead to war?]{.underline}** Food
scarcity, however, is only one aspect of food security. [Whether people
have **easy access** to food resources is also important]{.underline}.
So [even in countries where plenty of food is available]{.underline},
**[a large share of the population might still go hungry]{.underline}**.
As Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen notes, "[Starvation is the characteristic
of some people not having enough food to eat]{.underline}. It is not the
characteristic of there being not enough food to eat." [Grievances over
food and the **necessity to secure access** to food resources can
motivate **marginalized groups to participate in rebellions and
wars**]{.underline}. A number of scholars are researching how
[inequitable access to food affects violence]{.underline} within the
state. As Ben Bagozzi and I show in a recent paper, [armed actors
worldwide are motivated to fight over local food resources.]{.underline}
Here's why **[these conflicts tend to happen in regions with more
food]{.underline}** crops, not less. [For rebel groups,
securing]{.underline} --- and controlling --- [food resources is vital
for the insurgency]{.underline} to advance. [And when the government is
slow or unable to supply combat rations, state forces also may be forced
to extract food supplies from the local population]{.underline}, So
**[scarce food resources in a region locked in conflict act as both fuel
and reward for hungry combatants]{.underline}**. [Access to more local
food resources]{.underline}, especially in the case of rebel groups,
[can also be used to attract recruits, as happened in **Sierra Leone and
Somalia**]{.underline}. [Regions where wheat and barley are grown are
also an important source of support for the Islamic State in Iraq and
Syria]{.underline}. The focus on how the demand for food resources
influences armed conflict complements the research done on the effects
of food scarcity. It also explains why [agricultural areas see more
violence]{.underline}. In these regions, individuals live largely on
locally grown food. [If the government's safety nets are mismanaged or
weak, those who control access to food can more easily recruit
individuals and operate for a longer period of time]{.underline}. And
[this also explains why there is an uptick in violence during times of
more rainfall]{.underline} --- for instance, in sub-Saharan Africa. [By
providing armed groups with an **added motivation to fight as well as
the ability to expand their numbers** and strength, **local food
security can therefore shape global conflict patterns.**]{.underline}

### Food Alt Caus -- Trade War

#### Trade war is an alt cause.

**Reuters** 5-23-20**19** -- Reuters is an international news
organization. \[\"Farmers are \'casualties\' of Trump\'s trade war,
agriculture secretary admits,\" Accessible Online at:
https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/farmers-are-casualties-trump-s-trade-war-admits-agriculture-secretary-n1021376\]
@ AG

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue acknowledged that [American **farmers
are \"casualties\" of** President Donald Trump\'s **trade war** with
China]{.underline}, according to an interview broadcast on Tuesday.
Perdue told CNN he did not expect a trade deal to be reached when Trump
meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping this month at the G-20 summit in
Japan but hopes one can be struck by the end of the year. The Trump
administration has designated aid for [farmers]{.underline}, a key
constituency that helped him win the election in 2016, but they still
[have been among the hardest hit from the trade dispute with
China]{.underline}. \"I think [they are one of the casualties with trade
disruption]{.underline}, yes,\" Perdue told CNN. \"We knew going in that
when you flew the penalty flag on China, the retaliation, if it came,
would be against the farmer. [America isn\'t a tank country. Trump\'s
misguided \'Salute to America\' tried to make it one]{.underline}.
\"I\'ve told the president --- and the president understands --- [you
can\'t pay the bills with patriotism]{.underline},\" Perdue told CNN.
\"We know that and certainly he knows that. That\'s why he\'s trying to
supplement the damage they\'re having from trade disruptions with market
facilitation.\" The Trump administration last month unveiled a \$16
billion aid package for farmers to offset losses from the 10-month trade
war with China. Payment rates to farmers would be determined by where
they farm rather than what crops they grow. [The trade
dispute]{.underline}, which escalated this month after Washington and
Beijing raised tariffs on imports of each other's goods, [has left U.S.
farmers sitting on **record volumes** of soybeans with China **halting
purchases**. China once was a destination for **more than 60 percent**
of U.S. soybean **exports**.]{.underline}

### Food ! D

#### No correlation between food shortages and conflict---other factors

**Buhaug et al 15** \[Halvard Buhaug, Peace Research Institute in Oslo
an Norwegian University of Science and Technology. Tor Benjaminsen,
Espen Sjaastad, Ole Magnus Theisen.\] "Climate variability, food
production shocks, and violent conflict in Sub-Saharan Africa"
Environmental Research Letters, Volume 10, Number 12
(<http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/10/12/125015>)

[Across all models, we find relatively **weak** and **insignificant**
effects for domestic food production]{.underline} and we also note that
the sign of the coefficients shifts between outcome types. In this
sense, table 1 implicitly contrasts both claims that political violence
is more prevalent when basic needs are met (Salehyan and Hendrix 2014)
and claims that agricultural income shocks increase civil conflict risk
(von Uexkull 2014). [The results are consistent with Koub]{.underline}i
et al (2012) [and van Weezel]{.underline} (2015), however, [who conclude
that rainfall]{.underline}---a significant determinant of yields in
SSA---[has little impact on conflict]{.underline} either directly or
through economic performance. The covariate that best and most
consistently explains temporal variation in political violence is the
time-lagged conflict incidence indicator. Models 1--2 show that a new
civil conflict is unlikely to break out if another one is already
ongoing in the same country whereas Models 3--6, which capture the
occurrence of less organized conflict, demonstrate that violence begets
violence. Coups d\'état (Models 7--8) exhibit a comparatively weak
temporal correlation pattern in our data and are generally regarded as a
highly unpredictable phenomenon (Luttwak 1979). Next, [we estimate the
same set of models on]{.underline} a subsample of 14 [countries in SSA
where rainfall has a large and significant positive effect on food
production]{.underline} (figure 2(b); see supplementary information,
section B for details). To better capture the influence of climate
variability and reduce concerns with endogeneity, we further replace the
standard OLS model with two-stage instrumental variable regression. The
first stage in this model estimates the joint influence of annual
rainfall (linear and squared terms) and temperature (linear) on
contemporaneous food production. This effect then constitutes the
exogenous instrument for food production in the second stage. The
results are reported in table 2. Mirroring the results presented above,
[we fail to uncover a robust signal for agricultural
performance]{.underline}, although the sign of the coefficient for food
production now remains negative in seven of the eight specifications.
Food production shocks may have different consequences depending on the
socioeconomic context, so next we consider a series of interactive
relationships. Specifically, we investigate the joint effect of food
production and (i) low level of development, (ii) extent of
discriminatory political system, and (iii) economic dependence on
agriculture; three conditions whereby loss of income from agriculture
might constitute a particular challenge to society. To model these
interactions, we include time-varying regressors instead of
country-fixed effects where (i) is represented by infant mortality rate
(IMR; World Bank 2014), (ii) is captured using the Ethnic Power
Relations v.1.1 data (Cederman et al 2010), while (iii) uses an index of
agricultural contribution to GDP (World Bank 2014). Moreover, to
preserve focus on temporal dynamics, food production is now
operationalized as yearly deviation from the country mean, 1961--2009.
We use additive inverse deviation values to ensure theoretical
consistency among the components in the interaction terms. [All models
control for]{.underline} (ln) [population]{.underline} size, [conflict
history]{.underline}, and a [common time trend]{.underline}, [and models
without IMR and agricultural dependence additionally control
for]{.underline} (ln) [GDP per capita]{.underline}. The results are
presented in table 3. Again, **[we are unsuccessful in establishing a
consistent covariation pattern between agricultural performance and
political violence]{.underline}**. Interpreting the combined effect of
interaction terms with continuous parameters is inherently difficult but
figure 4 shows that food production is insignificantly related to all
conflict outcomes across levels of socioeconomic development for all
three interaction terms. The sole exception is the result in Model 24,
where lower food production in highly discriminatory societies is
negatively associated with non-state conflict. **[This result would seem
to contradict the standard scarcity thesis]{.underline}** (Homer-Dixon
1999) although it is consistent with observations that conflict is more
prevalent during surplus years (Witsenburg and Adano 2009, Salehyan and
Hendrix 2014). Mirroring earlier research, ethnopolitical exclusion is
strongly related to higher civil conflict risk, but not necessarily to
other forms of political violence. Infant mortality rate and economic
dependence on agriculture appear largely irrelevant. While this may come
as a surprise, recall that most countries in SSA are characterized by
underdevelopment and a large agricultural sector, implying that the
variation in values on these indicators is modest. Large parameter
uncertainties and p-values above the conventional significance threshold
(5%) may disguise substantively important effects (Ward et al 2010).
Accordingly, as a final assessment, we conduct a set of out-of-sample
simulations and compare predictions for models with and without food
production. The models are estimated on a subset of the full sample, in
this case all years before 2000, and the estimated effects are then used
to predict conflict outcomes out of sample, i.e., the 2000--09 period.
Figure 5 shows the predicted values from four pairs of models that are
specified similarly to Models 17, 20, 23, and 26, except for the shorter
time period and the fact that one model in each pair drops the food
production deviation variable. [For civil conflict and social unrest,
the models generate very similar predictions, signaling that
agricultural performance adds **little to the models\' predictive
power**]{.underline}. There is more spread in the predictions for the
remaining two outcome categories. [Puzzlingly]{.underline}, [the model
without food production performs **better** in both
cases]{.underline}---i.e., the Receiver Operating Characteristics curves
have higher \'Area Under the Curve\' scores. We hesitate to put too much
emphasis on the ROC tests, given the rareness of the outcomes (notably
Models 17 and 26) and the relatively small training samples (Models 20
and 23), but nonetheless the patterns observed in the out-of-sample
simulations substantiate the regression results reported above;
fluctuations in agricultural output explain little of the observed
variation in political violence in post-colonial Sub-Saharan Africa. 5.
Concluding remarks Emerging [evidence suggests that food price shocks
are associated with an increase in social unrest]{.underline} (Smith
2014, Bellemare 2015, Hendrix and Haggard 2015, Weinberg and Bakker
2015). Yet, the robust \'non-finding\' presented here implies that
so-called \'food riots\' play out largely isolated from
climate-sensitive production dynamics in the affected countries.
Likewise, [claims that]{.underline} adverse weather and [harvest failure
drive]{.underline} contemporary [violence]{.underline} in Africa (e.g.,
Hsiang et al 2013, IFPRI 2015) **[are not supported by our
analysis]{.underline}**. **[Instead]{.underline}**, [social protest and
rebellion during times of **food price spikes**]{.underline} **[may be
better understood as reactions to poor and unjust government
policies]{.underline}**, corruption, repression, and market failure
(e.g., Bush 2010, Buhaug and Urdal 2013, Sneyd et al 2013, Chenoweth and
Ulfelder 2015).

@ AG

Do food prices cause social unrest? The results in this article indicate
that the answer to this question is a qualified "yes." While rising food
prices appear to cause food riots, [food price volatility is at best
**negatively associated** with and at worst unrelated to social
unrest]{.underline}. [These findings **go against** much of the
prevailing rhetoric surrounding food prices]{.underline}. Indeed,
whereas [many in the media]{.underline} and among policy makers [were
quick to blame food price volatility for the food riots of]{.underline}
20[08]{.underline} and of 2010--2011, [the **empirical
results**]{.underline} in this article [indicate that]{.underline}
rising food price levels are to blame and that increases in food price
[volatility may actually **decrease** the number of food
riots]{.underline}. Additionally, specifications that focus on food
price volatility at the expense of food price levels show that the
latter is not statistically significantly related to the former. [These
findings are **in line** with those in the applied microeconomics
literature on the impacts of rising food prices]{.underline} (Deaton
1989) and of food price volatility (Bellemare, Barrett, and Just 2013).
Moreover, the finding that increases in the level of food prices cause
social unrest appears to be driven by the food crises of 2008 and of
2010--2011.

military sales: a financial analysis and assessment of the
administrative surcharge rate,\" Accessible Online at:

The FMS surcharge rate has changed three times in the past 40 years and
is reviewed annually by the DSCA. The DSCA is similar to a working
capital fund in that both organizations have the goal of breaking even.
The difference between these two organizations is that a working capital
fund changes their surcharge rates every year based on predicted sales
and market conditions. [The DSCA has expressed a reluctance to change
their surcharge rates frequently]{.underline}. The first reason is that
[purchasing countries **prefer the stability of a constant rate**, and a
changing surcharge rate would disrupt the decision-making processes of
countries looking to invest in American military products]{.underline}.
25 Secondly[, because cases last an average of seven years, a constantly
changing surcharge rate would **complicate case
management**]{.underline} (DSCA, personal communication, January 5--7,
2011).
