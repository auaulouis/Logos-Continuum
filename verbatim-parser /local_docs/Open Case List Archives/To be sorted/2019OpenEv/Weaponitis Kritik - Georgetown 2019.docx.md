#### The affirmative's focus on arms reductions is a flawed approach to understanding violence and war -- it distracts us from more systemic analysis

The second major thesis is that [the real threat of nuclear war is not
to be found in the instruments of destruction, but in the periodically
reckless behavior of nuclear superpowers in fueling the flames of
violence and intervening in conflicts around the world, especially in
the Third World.]{.underline} For Schwartz and Derber the most signifi-
cant chronology of the nuclear age is not that of the deployment and
counter-deploy- ment of weapon systems, but the series of crises and
confrontations that came close - in some cases perilously close - to
crossing the \'firebreak\' into nuclear war. Thus [the most effective
steps that can be taken to reduce the risk of nuclear war involve pri-
marily political, versus technological, issues]{.underline}. Most
important here would be **[development of a politics making it difficult
or impossible for the superpowers to intervene in external conflicts,
intervention which is not only morally unjustifiable, but which
inherently runs the risk of escalation (by design or acci- dent) into
nuclear confrontation.]{.underline}** It is here that certain kinds of
arms control could make a real difference, especially measures that
reduced the forward deployment of tac- tical and intermediate-range
nuclear wea- pon systems, including the provocative and dangerous
projection of nuclear naval forces. The authors find it ironic that
these kinds of arms control measures have gener- ally received the least
attention. In considering the arguments put forward in support of these
theses I will indicate where these are likely to encounter the most
debate. It should be noted at the outset that a central objective of the
many bold conten- tions in The Nuclear Seduction is to provoke precisely
this kind of debate. Whether or not one agrees with their conclusions,
readers will benefit from the acuity of their arguments and the wealth
of documenta- tion. 2. Remembering the Meaning of the Nuclear Revolution
Part I, \'Why the Arms Race Doesn\'t Matter\', presents a series of
interrelated arguments to support the claim that the increment **[in
weapons and technology has little relationship to either the likelihood
or outcome of nuclear war.]{.underline}** (Schwartz and Derber are not
arguing the arms race doesn\'t matter in social, economic, or moral
terms. It does, and they are well aware of the social costs in these
dimensions.) First, and perhaps most important, we are reminded of the
awesome destructive power of thermonuclear weapons. [The nuclear
revolution put an end to the weapons paradigm, where the quantitative
increment in weaponry could represent significant mili- tary advantage,
and which governed war- making for millenni]{.underline}a. Hydrogen
warheads numbering in the tens can inflict vast des- truction on
societies. [Since the 1950s, cer- tainly by the early 1960s, both
superpowers have possessed nuclear arsenals guarantee- ing a situation
of \'existential deterrence\', by which is meant that no foreseeable
alter- ation in strategy, technology, or increase in weapons can alter
the fundamental reality of mutual vulnerability to nuclear
destruction.]{.underline}

#### The focus on war as a singular event ignores the larger process of structural violence -- adopting a broader understanding of violence is a prerequisite to real solutions 

Dr. Laksiri **Fernando 3**, Director of the Centre for Democracy and
Development ("Transforming negative peace to positive peace," Daily
News, April 2, <http://archives.dailynews.lk/2002/04/02/fea01.html> //EN

However, the ceasefire is not enough[**. All ceasefires are fragile by
nature whatever the monitory mechanisms that are in place. War is only
the symptom**. Ethnic conflict is the ailment]{.underline}. **[Ceasefire
or negative peace is like treating the symptoms without addressing the
ailment.]{.underline}** Unless and until solutions are sought to resolve
the ethnic conflict in a reasonable manner, and reasonable to all ethnic
communities to mean the Tamils, the Sinhalese and the Muslims, the
ailment will not be cured.

The United Nations observed the year 2000 as the \"International Year
for the Culture of Peace.\" In its declaration announcing the year, the
following definition was given for us to contemplate.

\"**[Peace]{.underline}** is not only the absence of conflict, but
[requires a positive, dynamic and participatory process where dialogue
is encouraged and conflicts are resolved in a spirit of mutual
understanding and cooperation.\"]{.underline}

Clear distinction

Following from the above definition there is a clear distinction between
negative peace and positive peace. What we have achieved so far is
negative peace, the absence of war for the time being. The ceasefire
itself is fragile. There is still the readiness and capacity on both
sides to wage war in case of a major disagreement. There is no firm
commitment on both sides to resolve disputes and disagreements
permanently on a peaceful and democratic manner**[. The fire of the gun
has temporarily ceased, but the guns are still aimed at each
other.]{.underline}** This is the fragility of the present peace.

If there is firm commitment to resolve the disputes through peaceful and
democratic manner, then the necessary steps in a positive peace process
should commence. That means decommissioning, demobilization and
disarmament at least on an incremental manner. What we have achieved so
far is the disarmament of other parties and de-mining on a limited
scale. A positive peace process also implies primarily the resurrection
of democratic institutions and holding of elections by allowing people
to enter the democratic main stream in the affected areas. The steps
towards positive peace also mean the re-establishment of the justice
system with firm safeguards particularly for human rights.

Positive peace in its broadest sense means many more things than even
the above measures. No one should be asking all these overnight. But
there should be a vision and a direction towards achieving positive
peace in its fullest possible meaning in the future. Otherwise, there
will be no future for our society. There is endemic violence in our
society - violence at home, work place, university and elections.
Societal violence undoubtedly breeds into ethnic violence and war.
Curtailing violence at micro level obviously is necessary to curtail
violence at macro level and vise versa.

[Positive peace in its]{.underline} ultimate [objective means not only
the absence of direct violence, but also the structural violence in its
all forms]{.underline}. It means a full measure of justice, equality and
social harmony in all respects. The negative peace is like \"negative
healthiness,\" the mere absence of sickness. But healthiness should be a
positive one. Not only the absence of sickness, but also the physical
fitness and good muscle tone. Peace should be like that, a positive one.

Johan Galtung is the person who made the [distinction between what we
normally call violence (physical violence) and structural
violence.]{.underline} [Structural violence]{.underline} might not harm
the victims directly. But the **[people are harmed, victimized and
violated through institutional means and structures]{.underline}**.
Discrimination, inequality and social marginalization are some forms of
structural violence on the ethnic front. Poverty, malnutrition, and
economic marginalization are several forms of structural violence on the
social front. If peace is the absence of violence, it should mean the
absence of violence including structural violence as well. Peace means
not only the absence of war and violence but also the absence of causes
of war and violence.

#### The affirmative's focus on arm reduction, in order to mitigate nuclear war, turns case

//EN

There are two central theses of The Nuclear Seduction. The first is that
the nuclear arms race, while producing an end- less succession of
technologically sophisticated and frightening weaponry, is itself not
the major factor determining the likelihood of nuclear war. Hence [peace
movements on the left, arms controllers in the center, and nuclear hawks
on the right, have all been victims of \'the nuclear
seduction\']{.underline} - **[the belief that the characteristics and
specific numbers of weapons matter most when it comes to the issue of
nuclear war]{.underline}.** In the authors\' view far too much of the
nuclear debate has focused on hardware, on which weapons should be
deployed, or opposed. [**This obsession** with weapons, or
\'weaponitis\', **has obscured a central truth:**]{.underline}

.. . short of near-total nuclear disarmament, we believe that [no change
in the arms race can in fact make a profound difference. MX, Star Wars,
INF, a freeze, or even a 90 percent reduction in nuclear arsenals cannot
reliably change the horror of a nuclear war. They cannot much affect the
risk that the nuclear states will plunge us onto that horror. They
cannot make the world much safer or more dangerous than it already
is]{.underline} (p.1)

#### Focus on weapons reductions covers the political and personal motivations that make war possible

**Schwartz and Derber 93 \--** William A. Schwartz, a professor of
property law at Yeshiva University\'s Cardozo School of Law, and Charles
Derber, Professor of Sociology at Boston College, THE NUCLEAR SEDUCTION:
WHY THE ARMS RACE DOESN'T MATTER- AND WHAT DOES, University of
California Press, 1993. p. 1-2.

**[A nuclear sword]{.underline}**, we all know, **[hangs over the
earth.]{.underline}** But where does the danger of nuclear war come
from? What makes it worse? How can we reduce it?

**[For many years, a striking consensus has reigned: the nuclear arms
race between the superpowers is the main source of
danger.]{.underline}** The arms race is "the central concern of the
closing years of the century,\" the cause célebre of our time. A U.S.
senator says that \"the very survival of our planet, the survival of the
human race, is at stake,\" a common view.

**[The right, the center, and the left disagree]{.underline}**, of
course, **[about how the United States should run the arms race. The
right urges us to build weapons]{.underline}** like the MX missile, the
Stealth bomber, and \"Star Wars\"; **[the center, to sign arms control
treaties]{.underline}** like NF and START with the Soviet Union; **[and
the left, to stop and then reverse the arms race through a test
ban]{.underline}**, a \"freeze,\" and huge reductions in nuclear
arsenals. But **[all focus on the hardware, the weapons
themselves.]{.underline}** Most of the nuclear debate concerns which
weapons should be deployed and which destroyed.

But short of near total nuclear disarmament, we believe that **[no
change in the arms race can in fact make a profound
difference.]{.underline}** MX, Star Wars, IN,F, a freeze, or **[even a
90 percent reduction in nuclear arsenals cannot reliably change the
horror of a nuclear war.]{.underline}** They cannot much affect the risk
that the nuclear states will plunge us into that hor- ror. **[They
cannot make the world much safer or more dangerous than it already
is.]{.underline}**

The nuclear danger is real---even more ominous, as we will show, than
most people appreciate. But **[the fixation on weapons has obscured the
real menace: the political conflict and violence raging]{.underline}**
around the world **[that could one day burn out of control and set off a
nuclear cataclysm. As the world debates largely irrelevant missiles and
arms control treaties, the superpowers are fanning the flames of
conflict and war from Afghanistan to Nicaragua, Lebanon to
Cambodia.]{.underline}** Forty **[years of history reveal that such
conflicts can suddenly]{.underline}** veer out of control and even
**[erupt into open superpower confrontation. Yet in a time of
unprecedented public concern about nuclear war, few---even in the peace
movement---protest the nuclear hazards of their governments' foreign
intrigues and interventions.]{.underline}**

**[Those of us concerned with the nuclear threat have long been like the
apocryphal drunk who searches for his lost keys hour after hour under a
lamppost-because it's light there. The giant weapons systems are
seductive, the obvious place to look for answers to the nuclear peril.
The light there is good. But there is little to be found]{.underline}**.
lf we want the keys to a safer world, we must turn the light to the real
conflicts and battlefields where the superpowers and their clients
confront each other every day, often hidden from public view, and where
they periodically collide in terrifying crises that threaten to provoke
worldwide catastrophe.

Normative discourse focuses on [weapons]{.underline} as the cause of
insecurity \-\-- this "weapons paradigm" drastically exaggerates the
role weapons play in causing violence

**Schwartz and Derber 93 \-- William A. Schwartz, a professor of
property law at Yeshiva University\'s Cardozo School of Law, and Charles
Derber, Professor of Sociology at Boston College, THE NUCLEAR SEDUCTION:
WHY THE ARMS RACE DOESN'T MATTER- AND WHAT DOES, University of
California Press, 1993. P. 2.**

**[Public issues generally develop a]{.underline}** \"culture,\" a
**[consensus about the key questions]{.underline}**, the level of
analysis, **[and the language of debate. Since these assumptions are
shared, they rarely come up for discussion. The common
perspective]{.underline}** that guides discourse **[on nuclear
war]{.underline}** and peace **[is]{.underline}** what we call **[the
"weapons paradigm." It magnifies the importance of the weapons
themselves far beyond their real significance. It views weapons as the
basic source of security or insecurity, power or weakness, peace or war.
It pegs the arms race as the problem and some change in that race as the
solution.]{.underline}**

**[If nuclear weapons were like conventional ones, then
their]{.underline}** number and technical **[characteristics would of
course matter. But nuclear weapons]{.underline}** are different. They
**[are so powerful that]{.underline}** both
**[superpowers]{.underline}** long ago **[acquired the means to utterly
destroy]{.underline}** each other along with much of the rest of **[the
planet.]{.underline}** For decades the arms race and arms control have
changed only the number of times that we can bounce the radiating rubble
of the world.

#### Their defense of particular weapon systems distracts from an overall critique of militarism---always another weapon for another war.

**Schwartz and Derber 1990**

William A., Boston Nuclear Study Group, and Charles, BNSG and professor

http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft1n39n7wg/

**[The real threat of the anti-nuclear]{.underline}** war **[movement
has always been that it might politicize and encourage a mass revolt
against American militarism]{.underline}** in the Third World. This
could well occur if the U.S. population realized that the victims
include not only Salvadorans, Nicaraguans, Lebanese, Libyans, Grenadans,
Angolans, and so on, but potentially themselves and their families as
well. **[As long as concerned citizens busy themselves with
learning]{.underline}** MX **[missile throw weights and]{.underline}**
Pershing II **[flight times, demonstrating at nuclear weapons
bases]{.underline}**, and pressuring Congress about Star Wars, **[this
threat is coopted. These functions of weaponitis have not gone
completely unnoticed within the anti-nuclear weapons
movement]{.underline}**. Activist Tom Atlee observes that weapons
systems and arms control proposals---technically complex and easily
multiplied year after year---are ideal for keeping the opposition busily
ineffective. He asks, \"Could it be that our friends in **[the Military
Industrial Complex Establishment]{.underline}** (let\'s call them MICE,
shall we?) **[long ago figured out how to keep]{.underline}** us (in
**[the peace movement) hopping around on their playing
field]{.underline}**, dutifully following their game plan---without us
realizing we were being manipulated?\" **[The method is simple. \"The
MICE entice us into debates about weapons systems]{.underline}**.... The
catch is that **[even when we \'win\' one of these debates, the MICE
always come up with new weapons systems]{.underline}** ... for us **[to
argue about]{.underline}**. And **[since it takes the American public
months or years just to figure out what each debate is about, the MICE
have plenty of time to start a new development before the old one runs
out of steam]{.underline}**. So we never catch up to the MICE.... It is
their game and they rig it in their favor.\"

### 2NC Anti-War protest 

#### The affirmatives anti-war stance is classic placebo activism, in their firm stance against state policy they legitimize it by being the ying to militarisms yang\-\--when people protested against Iraq, Bush reacted by saying "you see what we are fighting for! For people to have the right to protest against government policy...soon that will be possible in Iraq!" 

**Zizek 2007**

Slavoj, Resistance is Surrender: What to Do about Capitalism?,
http://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n22/slavoj-zizek/resistance-is-surrender

[[The]{.mark} big [demonstrations]{.mark}]{.underline} in London and
Washington [[against the US attack on]{.mark} [Iraq]{.mark}]{.underline}
a few years ago [[offer]{.mark} [an exemplary case]{.mark} of this
strange symbiotic]{.underline} relationship between power and
resistance. [[Their paradoxical outcome was]{.mark} that [both sides
were satisfied]{.mark}. The [protesters]{.mark}]{.underline} saved their
beautiful souls: they [[made it clear that they don't agree with the
government's policy on]{.mark} Iraq. [Those in power]{.mark}
calmly]{.underline} accepted it, even [[profited]{.mark}]{.underline}
from it: [not only did [the protests]{.mark} in no way prevent the
already-made decision to attack Iraq; they]{.underline} also served to
[[legitimise it]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Thus]{.underline} George
[[Bush's]{.mark} [reaction]{.mark} [to]{.mark} mass demonstrations
[protesting]{.mark} his visit to London, in effect: '[You see, this is
what we are fighting for]{.mark}, [so that what people are doing here --
protesting against their government policy -- will be possible]{.mark}
also [in Iraq]{.mark}]{.underline}[!]{.mark}'

#### The problem the affirmative wants to solve is one of spectacle; nonviolence put some people on top and others on the bottom of a binary politic that still labels some as courageous and others as cowards, it just judges that with inverted values, this ultimately results in violence; peace being a struggle for justice is just as narratable as the spectacle of war; our task is not to swap obsessions-vote negative to explore the nexus of war and peace 

**Mariani 8** (Giorgio Mariani is Professor of American Literature at
the "Sapienza" University of Rome. He is Vice-President of the
International American Studies Association and the co-editor, with Bruno
Cartosio and Alessandro Portelli, of A \` coma, an Italian journal of
American studies, "Ad bellum purificandum, or, Giving Peace a (Fighting)
Chance in American Studies," Project Muse)

Although, as Sollors argues, "There may be no American Lysistrata, and
American literature may not be concerned with peace as was the book of
Psalms . . . there is a tradition of American imaginings of 'peace' that
could be profitably studied and taught" (34). I agree, and here I should
perhaps reconsider a point made earlier on. [Perpetual
peace]{.underline} (like happiness, harmony, or requited love)
[may]{.underline} indeed [lack]{.underline} [aesthetic
appeal]{.underline} and---[to the]{.underline} [extent that
all]{.underline} [storytelling hinges on]{.underline} some kind of
[conflict]{.underline}---[be virtually impossible to
narrate.]{.underline} However[, [if peace is reimagined as the
struggle]{.mark}]{.underline} for peace and
[[justice]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[it becomes]{.mark} both [as narratable
and "spectacular" as war]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} It is certainly
no accident that what we found appealing in the lives of figures such as
Addams, Gandhi, and King is first and foremost their readiness to be
women or men of action and that they themselves often couched their
longing for peace in the language of strife and heroism. Yet
[we]{.underline} [must]{.underline} also come to [realize]{.underline}
that "[[imaginings of peace]{.underline}" [may be]{.underline}]{.mark}
often [[found]{.underline}]{.mark} precisely [[in]{.mark} those [texts
that we would consider]{.mark}]{.underline} more [[appropriate to teach
in a "]{.mark}War and]{.underline} [American [Literature"
course]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The]{.underline}]{.mark} most urgent
[[task is not]{.underline}]{.mark} [simply [to replace the obsession
with America's obsession with war with a focus on an alternative
gun-less and peace-loving national]{.underline}
[tradition]{.underline}]{.mark}[, **[but rather to explore the dialectic
of war and peace]{.mark}**]{.underline} which quite often animates even
those texts---like Emerson's---that may at first strike us as only
promoting "the charm of war." In Burkean terms, I hope to see more
studies of American history, literature, and culture in which war "would
not be used primarily as a constitutive anecdote but rather as an
admonitory anecdote" (Grammar 330). As Burke writes towards the end of
his Grammar, one must be aware that "the world as we know it, the world
in history, cannot be described in its particularities by an idiom of
peace . . . hence the representative anecdote must contain militaristic
ingredients. [[It]{.mark} [may not be an anecdote of peace---but it may
be an anecdote giving us the purification of
war]{.mark}]{.underline}["]{.mark} (Grammar 337).38 The kind of renewed
interest in US antiwar discourse I am calling for should by no means be
construed as being simply yet another call to condemn America for not
living up to its own ideals. I agree with Amy Kaplan when she notes that
"[[condemning the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [for failing to measure up to its own
highest]{.underline} [standards]{.underline} [[may]{.underline}
[have]{.underline}]{.mark} some **[[strategic value
in]{.underline}]{.mark}** public **[[debates]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[[but]{.underline} [this]{.underline}]{.mark} approach
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} both [[insular and]{.underline}
[exceptionalist]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[as it implicitly makes the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[the
bearer of universal values]{.underline}]{.mark}," and I am all for
holding "the US to standards beyond its ideal self-image. . . .
[Standards of human rights, of international law, of ethics that stem
from cosmopolitan, transnational, and local sources]{.underline} and
[are not prescribed by and **limited to the ideals of a single
nation**"]{.underline} (145). My contention is that[, [by paying closer
attention to the dialectic of war and peace]{.mark},]{.underline}
American [[studies]{.mark} [m]{.mark}]{.underline}[ay]{.mark} both
[[rediscover]{.mark} [an important]{.mark}]{.underline} [homegrown
[tradition of militant pacifism]{.underline} [and avoid **the
parochialism of the jeremiad**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[A genuine concern
for peace is by definition meant to **curb rather than promote
nationalis**]{.mark}**m**.]{.underline} Unsurprisingly, all the great
pacifist manifestos have always been the product of cultural
cross-fertilization. For example, as John Gruesser has argued in
reference to Thoreau's "Resistance to Civil Government," "drawing on
Greek mythology, Confucius, the New Testament, and Shakespeare and
inspiring Leo Tolstoy, Mahatma Gandhi, suffragettes in England and the
United States, anti-apartheid activists, Martin Luther King, Jr., as
well as antiwar and antinuclear demonstrators around the world,
Thoreau's essay is international in both its pedigree and influence"
(173).39 I would therefore conclude by noticing that, given the recent
push towards the internationalization of American studies, it is
somewhat surprising that peace has not achieved the buzzword status
wished for by Sollors. Yet, I believe it is high time that it
should---especially today when, as Djelal Kadir has put it, "the global
repercussiveness of America makes it imperative for us Americanists to
be international Americanists" (149). At a time when [the]{.underline}
"[peace]{.underline}" [promoted]{.underline} [by]{.underline} the
[Bush]{.underline} administration [is a shameless Pax
Americana]{.underline}, it is no wonder that some of us are tempted, to
quote Kadir once again, to replace "the essentialist idealization of
America as devotional object" with "the equally essentialist reification
of a dark side of America as compensation for our chagrin at
demystification and disenchantment" (151). [It is]{.underline} therefore
all the more **[urgent]{.underline}** for a truly international American
studies [to rediscover a tradition of]{.underline} [militant
pacifism]{.underline} [that has opposed]{.underline} various versions of
[Pax Americana]{.underline}, from the days of the proto-Gringos and the
Trail of Tears to the Vietnam War and the attack on Iraq. As we do this,
we should not---as Michael Bellesiles apparently did---manipulate the
historical or textual record to suit our wishes, yet we should also
never ignore those instances in which Americans have raised their voices
against the gun-fighting spirit of the US. To invoke once again
Emerson's example, let us consider his "Cherokee Letter," dated 23 April
1838. Seldom discussed in Emerson criticism, this document is
unquestionably marked by both paternalism and a belief in the originally
"savage" nature of American Indian societies. Yet, if read against
contemporary texts like James Fenimore Cooper's Leatherstocking novels,
or Washington Irving's American Indian stories in The Sketch Book
(1819-20), Emerson's letter provides a telling example of what we are
used to thinking of as a quintessentially American voice taking his
nation to task not simply for not measuring up to its own ideals, but
precisely for violating standards of human rights, international law,
and ethics that are not limited to the US: Such a dereliction of all
faith and virtue, such a denial of justice, and such deafness to screams
for mercy were never heard of in times of peace and in the dealing of a
nation with its own allies, since the earth was made. . . . \[A\] crime
is projected that confounds our understanding by its magnitude,---a
crime that really deprives us as well as the Cherokees of a country; for
how could we call the conspiracy that should crush these poor Indians
our government, or the land that was cursed by their parting and dying
imprecations our country, any more? You, sir, will bring down that
renowned chair in which you sit into infamy if your seal is set to this
instrument of perfidy; and the name of this nation, hitherto the sweet
omen of religion and liberty, will stink to the world. (102--103) Judged
by today's standards, Emerson's words are unmistakably those of an
anti-American. By polemically contextualizing in world history the
cruelty of the Indian Removal, Emerson imagines an international public
opinion condemning the criminal behavior of the US government. To the
nationalist rhetoric of "my country right or wrong," Emerson juxtaposes
the notion that I can only call that country mine that behaves in a just
and humane way. Yet, important as they are, such [[critiques of
nationalism and militarism are]{.mark} more [significant when read
against the background of the ad bellum purificandum
tradition]{.mark}]{.underline} I have tried to sketch and which [we are
in dire need of rediscovering today]{.underline}, at a time [when
"the]{.underline} pacific [neoliberal rhetoric of globalization has been
replaced by the Hobbesian imaginary of endless war]{.underline}" (Deer
1), and---as James Hillman has argued in his recent and important A
Terrible Love of War (2004)---we are once again left to wonder why war
(both as fact and symbol) remains to many a fascinating and attractive
business. In Hillman's view the only way to fight for peace under
current conditions is by "going to war" with our minds. Even though he
never mentions Emerson in his book, when in the very first paragraph he
urges us to plunge our imagination into "the martial state of the soul,"
he is unknowingly quoting from Emerson's "Heroism." Similarly, the
epigraph of Hillman's book---"The Lord is a great warrior; His name is
The Lord," from Exodus---is the Biblical counterpart to Emerson's
quotation from Mohammed in "Heroism"---a reminder that any religion of
peace is always, perhaps inevitably, a religion of war. While I think
that some of the points Hillman makes in A Terrible Love of War are
rather perplexing, I do find his critique of all forms of naı¨ve
pacifism both convincing and timely.40 Some of the best pages of his
book are indeed the ones where he shows that no neat boundaries can be
drawn between Mars and Venus, peace and war, the field of love and the
battleground of hate. In sum, [[there is absolutely no need to think
that peace should achieve buzzword status in American studies at the
expense of war.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[The important
lesson]{.mark}]{.underline} that American thinkers such as Emerson and
Kenneth Burke have taught us is analogous to the conclusion Hillman
arrives at in his book: "Similis similibus curantur [is [the old motto:
cure by means of simila]{.mark}rs]{.underline} (rather than by means of
opposites)" (202). Or, as Burke put it roughly 70 years ago,
"[[Militaristic patterns are fundamental to our
'virtue]{.mark},']{.underline} even the word itself coming from a word
which the Latins applied to their warriors" (Attitudes 256). [[To the
peace that is under the shadow of Patriot missiles]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[we must oppose the warlike courage]{.mark} **[of the virtuous
peacefighter]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [so as to avoid,]{.underline} years
later, having [to repeat Tim O'Brien's bitter words on his Vietnam
experience: "I survived, but it's not a happy ending. I was a coward. I
went to the war"]{.underline} (63).

efforts to restrict the proliferation of small arms]{.underline}. The
article critiques conventional accounts that view such initiatives as
[illustrating the potential of global civil society to interject human
security concerns into the domain of arms regulation through the
exercise of bottom-up power]{.underline}. In order to do this, the
article first outlines the concept of securitization, particularly
Floyd\'s discussion of positive and negative forms of securitization and
Abrahamson\'s concept of the security continuum. This is used to frame
an analysis of contemporary HAC initiatives that locates them in the
much longer history of pariah weapons regulation and the way i[t relates
both to the framing of legitimized weapons and changes in the broader
regulation of the conventional defence trade in different
eras]{.underline}. In contrast to conventional accounts of the HAC
agenda, it is argued that initiatives such as those on landmines and
cluster munitions were successful precisely because they were consonant
with the same discourse used to legitimize both post-Cold War liberal
interventionism and the new generation modern high-tech weapons.
Moreover[, the extra-securitization of landmines, cluster munitions and
small arms has been accompanied by the (relative) desecuritization of
the trade in major conventional weapons and associated dual-use
technologies, a process that has a number of quite negative effects in
terms of arms trade regulation]{.underline}. The article concludes by
reflecting on the implications of the preceding analysis both for
thinking about processes of securitization and for arms trade
non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

### 2NC Drones 

#### Focus on drone tech crowds out real violence

US drone strikes make news every day, fostering worldwide outrage and
public scrutiny. The drone has become an icon of US lethality and
dominance, and it has understandably become a principal focus of our
antiwar effort.

But recent controversial revelations about presidential-approved "kill
lists," used to identify targets for drone assassinations, suggest a
broader scope for our opposition. US assassination and targeted killing,
with presidential approval, has been going on covertly for at least half
a century, and continues to this day, both with and without drones.
[Drone strikes may be merely the most visible portion of a wider, global
program of US targeted killing]{.underline}, "a covert side to the
Global War on Terrorism that is not visible and not currently
knowable."\[1\] Perhaps [a limited focus on remote-controlled murder by
drone technology blinds us to a broader US enterprise of targeted
assassination around the globe]{.underline}. Shouldn't we, then, [turn
more of our attention to this wider canvas of US killing,]{.underline}
repositioning our drone protest within a larger context[, rather than
limiting ourselves by our focused opposition to drone
technology?]{.underline}

#### A Focus on drones redirects attention to a more important focus on killings

**Noble 13** (Doug, antiwar activist, "Is It the Drones or the Killings

Oppose?," <http://www.counterpunch.org/2012/08/29/is-it-the-drones-or-the-killings-we-oppose/>)
//EN

There are, however, equally **[good reasons not to focus our opposition
on drones.]{.underline}** The wizardry of drone technology has great
popular appeal in the US. According to Pew Research's latest polling,
62% of the US public enthusiastically approve of drone use for
remote-controlled killing in the war on terror. The New York State Fair
now has a popular exhibit providing children the simulated thrill of
piloting a drone mission. [The burgeoning drone manufacturing
industry]{.underline} appears unstoppable, with nearly 50 companies
developing some 150 different systems, ranging from miniature models to
those with wingspans comparable to airliners. **[Law enforcement and
security agencies will have \$6 billion]{.underline}** in U.S. sales by
2016, for domestic surveillance. Altogether, the **[drone industry's
lobbying group]{.underline}**, **[Association for Unmanned Vehicle
Systems International]{.underline}**, claims 507 corporate members in 55
countries. There is [virtually no Congressional opposition]{.underline}
to the drone fever that has gripped the military, which is spending
\$4.2 billion on drones this year alone; one large bipartisan
congressional committee is solely committed to promoting drone
technology.

Furthermore, as the technology develops, drones will have many positive
uses beyond war and surveillance, diluting potential opposition to the
technology itself. So  [a continued focus on drones carries the danger
of distracting our attention from the horrific, illegal and immoral,
targeted killing of civilians, including women and children, which is
the original motivation for our years of opposition and
protest.]{.underline}

Instead, then, **[we should perhaps return our attention to the killing
itself.]{.underline}** [This would move us beyond the public fascination
with technology and would expose the criminality of targeted
assassination of civilians as not merely "collateral" but instead as an
intentional counterterrorist strategy aimed at preemptive elimination of
suspected enemies.]{.underline} [It could also offer an unprecedented
opportunity to expose the long sordid history of US counterinsurgency
policy that set the stage for Obama's current use of kill lists against
suspected militants in al Qaeda, the Taliban and other groups. It could
also open up a broader investigation of the covert killing now allegedly
being conducted by CIA and Special Forces, or their indigenous proxies,
throughout many countries in the world.]{.underline}

### 2NC Negative/Positive Peace

The affirmative represents "war" as a [singular, bounded
event]{.underline}. This ontological distinction between "war" and
"peace" ensures the continuation of [everyday militarism and
violence]{.underline}, turning the case.

Chris J. **Cuomo**, Professor of Philosophy at the University of
Cincinnati, **1996** ("War Is Not Just an Event: Reflections on the
Significance of Everyday Violence," *Hypatia*, Volume 11, Number 4,
Fall, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via JSTOR, p. 30-31)

Philosophical attention to war has typically appeared in the form of
justifications for entering into war, and over appropriate activities
within war. **[The spatial metaphors used to refer to war as a separate,
bounded sphere indicate assumptions that war is a realm of human
activity vastly removed from normal life, or a sort of happening that is
appropriately conceived apart from everyday events in peaceful times.
Not surprisingly, most discussions of the political and ethical
dimensions of war discuss war solely as an event---an occurrence, or
collection of occurrences, having clear beginnings and endings that are
typically marked by formal, institutional declarations. As happenings,
wars and military activities can be seen as motivated by identifiable,
if complex, intentions, and directly enacted by individual and
collective decision-makers and agents of states. But many of the
questions about war]{.underline}** that are of interest to
feminists\-\--including how large-scale, state-sponsored violence
affects women and members of other oppressed groups; how military
violence shapes gendered, raced, and nationalistic political realities
and moral imaginations; what such violence consists of and why it
persists; how it is related to other oppressive and violent institutions
and hegemonies---**[cannot be adequately pursued by focusing on events.
These issues are not merely a matter of good or bad intentions and
identifiable decisions]{.underline}**. In \"Gender and \'Postmodern\'
War,\" Robin Schott introduces some of the ways in which war is
currently best seen not as an event but as a presence (Schott 1995).
Schott argues that **[postmodern understandings of persons, states, and
politics, as well as the high-tech nature of much contemporary warfare
and the preponderance of civil and nationalist wars, render an
event-based conception of war inadequate]{.underline}**, especially
insofar as gender is taken into account. In this essay, I will expand
upon her argument by showing that **[accounts of war that only focus on
events are impoverished in a number of ways, and]{.underline}**
therefore feminist **[consideration of the political, ethical, and
ontological dimensions of war and the possibilities for resistance
demand a much more complicated approach]{.underline}**. I take Schott\'s
characterization of war as presence as a point of departure, though I am
not committed to the idea that the constancy of militarism, the fact of
its omnipresence in human experience, and the paucity of an event-based
account of war are exclusive to contemporary postmodern or postcolonial
circumstances.1 **[Theory that does not investigate or even notice the
omnipresence of militarism cannot represent or address the depth and
specificity of the everyday effects of militarism on women, on people
living in occupied territories, on members of military institutions, and
on the environment]{.underline}**. These effects are relevant to
feminists in a number of ways because **[military practices and
institutions help construct gendered and national identity,
and]{.underline}** because they **[justify the destruction of natural
nonhuman entities and communities during peacetime. Lack of attention to
these aspects of the business of making or preventing military violence
in an extremely technologized world results in theory that cannot
accommodate the connections among the constant presence of militarism,
declared wars, and other closely related social phenomena, such as
nationalistic glorifications of motherhood, media violence, and current
ideological gravitations to military solutions for social
problems]{.underline}**.

This representation of "war" as an isolated event leads to politics of
[crisis-control]{.underline} that can never hope to address the
[underlying structures of violence]{.underline}. Every singular "war"
the affirmative hopes to prevent will just reappear [over and over
again]{.underline}---every time we do crisis-control, it trades off with
[deeper structural changes]{.underline} that can create a positive
peace.

Cincinnati, **1996** ("War Is Not Just an Event: Reflections on the
Significance of Everyday Violence," *Hypatia*, Volume 11, Number 4,

**[Ethical approaches that do not attend to the ways in which warfare
and military practices are woven into the very fabric of life in
twenty-first century technological states lead to crisis-based politics
and analyses. For any feminism that aims to resist oppression and create
alternative social and political options, crisis-based ethics and
politics are problematic because they distract attention from the need
for sustained resistance to the enmeshed, omnipresent systems of
domination and oppression that so often function as givens in most
people\'s lives. Neglecting the omnipresence of militarism allows the
false belief that the absence of declared armed conflicts is peace, the
polar opposite of war. It is particularly easy for those whose lives are
shaped by the safety of privilege, and who do not regularly encounter
the realities of militarism, to maintain this false belief. The belief
that militarism is an ethical, political concern only regarding armed
conflict, creates forms of resistance to militarism that are merely
exercises in crisis control. Antiwar resistance is then mobilized when
the \"real\" violence finally occurs, or when the stability of privilege
is directly threatened, and at that point it is difficult not to respond
in ways that make resisters drop all other political priorities.
Crisis-driven attention to declarations of war might actually keep
resisters complacent about and complicitous in the general presence of
global militarism. Seeing war as necessarily embedded in constant
military presence draws attention to the fact that horrific,
state-sponsored violence is happening nearly all over, all of the time,
and that it is perpetrated by military institutions and other
militaristic agents of the state]{.underline}**. **[Moving away from
crisis-driven politics and ontologies concerning war and military
violence also enables consideration of relationships among seemingly
disparate phenomena, and therefore can shape more nuanced theoretical
and practical forms of resistance]{.underline}**. For example,
investigating the ways in which war is part of a presence allows
consideration of the relationships among the events of war and the
following: how militarism is a foundational trope in the social and
political imagination; how the pervasive presence and symbolism of
soldiers/warriors/patriots shape meanings of gender; the ways in which
threats of state-sponsored violence are a sometimes invisible/sometimes
bold agent of racism, nationalism, and corporate interests; the fact
that vast numbers of communities, cities, and nations are currently in
the midst of excruciatingly violent circumstances. **[It also provides a
lens for considering the relationships among the various kinds of
violence that get labeled \"war.\"]{.underline}** Given current American
obsessions with nationalism, guns, and militias, and growing hunger for
the death penalty, prisons, and a more powerful police state, one cannot
underestimate the need for philosophical and political attention to
connections among phenomena like the \"war on drugs,\" the \"war on
crime,\" and other state-funded militaristic campaigns.

## Impacts 

### 2NC Impact 

**Outweighs and turn their case \-\-- the focus on weapons at the
expense of state violence more broadly ensures that the state will
ignore their appeal while larger and deadlier weapons get built\
Martin 86**, Brian, associate professor in Science, Technology and
Society at the University of Wollongong, Australia, Peace Studies, No.
3, June/July 1986, pp. 36-39,
http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/86ps.html

Nuclear disarmament is a key theme of the Australian peace movement.
There are, for example, the various People for Nuclear Disarmament
groups, the Nuclear Disarmament Party, and the major Nuclear Disarmament
Conference held in Melbourne in August 1985. I argue that it is
dangerously narrow to focus so much on nuclear weapons, and also to
focus so much on disarmament.

[The basic problem with focussing on nuclear weapons is that they are
only one product of the war system]{.underline}. [The history of modem
warfare is one of recurrent technical innovation to increase the killing
power of weaponry. This process has been routinised in the past century
through the heavy sponsorship of science and technology by the
state]{.underline}. In effect, much of the knowledge and skills produced
and used by science and technology is tied to the military aims of
separate states.\[1\] [It so happens that nuclear weapons are currently
the most prominent of technological threats to human life. But the
driving force behind the development of weapons of mass destruction is
the state-technology system, not the weapons themselves.]{.underline}

As a potential solution to the problem of mass killing in warfare, the
locus on nuclear weapons has several limitations:

The killing power of conventional weapons has been increasing at a great
rate for decades. A large-scale conventional war between major
industrialised powers could kill many tens or even hundreds of millions
of people.

[Even if all nuclear weapons were dismantled tomorrow, the capacity to
produce new nuclear weapons would remain]{.underline}. With
technological advances in uranium isotope separation, in a few years
time it may be possible for small states and non-state groups to produce
nuclear weapons without great difficulty or expense.

Chemical and especially biological weapons have the potential to kill
large numbers of people. Future biological weapons could easily pose as
great a threat as present nuclear weapons.

Quite a few people realise that getting rid of nuclear weapons is not
enough, but nevertheless think that concentrating on nuclear weapons is
essential. One view is that cutting back on nuclear weapons should be
seen as only the first stage of efforts against war. The problem with
this is that most people, including members of peace groups, get caught
up with the immediate demands. The peace movement in the late 1950s and
early 1960s made the cessation of nuclear testing in the atmosphere a
major demand, with the result that the Partial Test Ban Treaty in 1963
took a lot of the wind out of the movement.

Another stance is that the threat posed by nuclear weapons is so
enormous and unprecedented that focussing on nuclear weapons is
necessary to buy time for any other social action: if there is a nuclear
war we will not be around to worry about poverty or sexism. In response
I would argue that [there is no automatic reason why \'buying time\' is
best achieved through a narrow concern about nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. [The effectiveness of social movements does not
derive simply from the size of the threat to human life that they are
protesting about, but rather from a whole range of factors, including
the possibility of reforms, the bandwagon effect and the organisation of
the movement.]{.underline}

Another argument is that a wider alliance can be built by focussing on
nuclear weapons and not alienating people by bringing up other demands.
The problem with that case is reliance on the lowest common denominator
makes it difficult to achieve anything more than pious declarations. The
heads of all the major weapons states tell us that they are in favour of
\'peace\', but that doesn\'t achieve anything.

[The major problem with the concentration on nuclear weapons is that it
encourages a technical fix approach]{.underline} such as the nuclear
freeze or other agreements made by governments. [The evidence is
overwhelming that arms negotiations hold little potential for changing
the war system, irrespective of popular pressure applied to
governments]{.underline}.\[2\]

Quite a number of historical examples show the limitations for social
movements of making demands which are too narrow. For example, the
progressive movement in the United States around the turn of the century
was a powerful reform movement. One of its major concerns was the abuses
perpetrated by large corporations: monopoly, exploitation, etc. The
focus was on large corporations, and the solution sought was
\'trust-busting\', in other words, using government intervention to
break up the monopolies. As in the case of nuclear disarmament
negotiations, there was more sound than action from politicians who took
up the progressive cause. But the basic limitation of the approach was
seeing the problem in the trusts rather than deeper in the capitalist
system. It hardly needs mentioning that although some monopolies were
broken up at the time, the size and power of US-based transnational
corporations is greater than ever today.

A similar difficulty faced the first wave of the feminist movement when
around the turn of the twentieth century it made achieving the vote for
women the major target. Barring women from voting was useful but - as
later events showed - not essential to continued male domination. After
the feminist movement achieved its immediate aim of the vote, it went
into decline for decades. This is the great danger of focussing too much
on \'achievable\' reforms.

\'Disarmament\' is the other side of the central attention placed on
nuclear disarmament. [Disarmament is normally conceived as a reversal of
the armament process and as something that is undertaken by governments.
The major limitation here, once again, is that concentrating on
disarmament does not address the driving forces behind the war system.
If the system of states, with each state founded on claims to a monopoly
on \'legitimate\' violence, is at the basis of the war system, then it
is futile to expect to turn back the armament process by appealing to
the rationality or political concerns of state elites]{.underline}.\[3\]
And yet that is exactly what the Australian peace movement has attempted
to do.

The main strategy of the Australian peace movement - inasmuch as a main
strategy can be perceived - is to apply pressure to the Australian
government to push for cutting free of the nuclear weapons connection.
The major rallies have been largely aimed at getting as many people on
the streets as possible, to impress the public and the government with
the breadth of concern.

Efforts to support the Democrats or the Nuclear Disarmament Party are
designed to apply electoral pressure on the government to sever its
links to the US nuclear system. The trouble with this is that the peace
movement has no alternative to military defence which it can proceed to
implement itself. By focussing on nuclear disarmament, the movement ties
itself to a \'see and plea\' approach of the sort which has failed time
and time again.

Will getting millions of people into the streets force the government to
take action? There were a million in the streets of New York in 1982.
Furthermore, opinion polls show that a large majority of US people
favour a nuclear freeze. Have the US policy-makers responded? Not in
terms of the substance of their policies.

### Turns Case 

#### Removing weapons doesn't address the root cause of war- even disarm maintains the war system

**Martin '90**

(Brian-, *Uprooting War*,
<http://uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/90uw/uw00.html>; Jacob)

[If all the military weapons in the world suddenly disappeared, this
would not eliminate the problem of war. If current social structures,
such as states and other systems of political and economic inequality,
remained, then it would not be long before armaments built up again to
the previous level. Nor would the problem of war be solved if
disarmament were decreed and carried out by a dominant
institution]{.underline}, such as a world government. [It would be easy
for resisting groups to hide]{.underline} weapons, including [nuclear
weapons, or]{.underline} to [make new ones with presently available
knowledge and resources. Disarmament]{.underline} as a goal [is not
enough for confronting]{.underline} the problem of [war. It is also
necessary to transform the structures that lead to war]{.underline}.

[War cannot simply be eliminated while leaving the rest of society as it
is, namely by freezing the status quo]{.underline}. Yet that is what is
assumed in efforts to stop war by appealing to elites. [The structural
conditions for war need to be removed and superseded by alternative
structures which do not lead to war.]{.underline}

In what direction do dominant social structures need to be changed? In
very general terms, [the direction needs to be towards greater
political, social and economic equality]{.underline}, towards greater
justice and freedom, and towards greater control by people over the
decisions which influence their lives. Methods for moving in these
directions are discussed in later chapters.

The principle of structural change is a far-reaching one. The focus of
peace movements in the 1980s, as it was in the late 1950s and early
1960s, has been nuclear war. But [[even accepting the unlikely
possibility that state elites would ever dismantle their nuclear
weapons, eliminating nuclear weapons would not eliminate war, nor would
it prevent the creation of weapons more deadly than nuclear weapons. The
goal needs to be more than disarmament, and certainly much more than
nuclear disarmament.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### 2NC Structural Violence Impact 

#### Their focus on "negative peace" ignores structural violence---this outweighs the case.

**[Structural violence refers to aspects of society that limit people's
ability to reach their potential. Economic
stratification]{.underline}**, which occurs when one segment of society
has difficulty finding adequate shelter or food while other segments of
society do not, **[is an important factor]{.underline}** in structural
violence. When there are great differences in the educational facilities
available to students in different locales, based on funding formulas
and other socio-economic structures, structural violence has been
committed. **[Because it is interwoven with the society's economic
system, structural violence is seen as a normal part of living in
society, an inadvertent consequence of "the way things
are."]{.underline}** Thus, features of an economic or political system
that limit human potential for some while enhancing life for others are
considered structural violence.\[30\] **[In contrast to direct violence,
structural violence kills slowly, unintentionally, and
indirectly]{.underline}**.\[31\] **[It shortens people's lives by
chronic exposure to difficult living conditions, rather than by a
specific, direct act. Globalization adds to structural violence because
it fuels tremendous differences between people in terms of their wealth
and resources, making some suffer at the expense of
others]{.underline}**. For example, when economic sanctions are placed
on a country, the effect on the leadership of that country is slight
relative to that experienced by the general populace. **[If we define
peace in terms of what it is---"the presence of qualities, values and
approaches in human relationships that build greater
harmony"]{.underline}**\[32\]**[---rather than what it is not---the lack
of war or conflict---then the scope of peace broadens substantially. At
least two things are gained by doing this. First, if we are truly
concerned about peace and the prevention of violence, we must address
its root causes]{.underline}**. Some causes, such as anti-social
personality disorder, greed, and lust for power, are classically
"psychological" and reside within the individual. Others are broader,
systemic conditions that lie outside the scope of the individual but
nevertheless affect his or her actions.\[33\] **[In order to lessen war,
violence, and conflict effectively, we must recognize and utilize
multiple levels of analysis, and not limit our efforts simply to
individuals, groups, or societies. By improving oppressive living
conditions, we may reduce the likelihood of direct violence and improve
people's quality of life]{.underline}**.\[34\] **[A second benefit from
using a broader, more positive definition of peace is moral consistency.
It seems inconsistent to claim to seek peace, while at the same time
endorsing practices that harm children and others particularly affected
by structural violence]{.underline}**.\[35\] **[A morality that opposes
direct violence while supporting structural violence would be inhumane
at best]{.underline}**. From an LDS perspective, charitable concern and
action on behalf of others is inextricably linked to peace.\[36\] From
the perspective of psychology, an interesting question regarding
structural violence is how people who aspire to live good, moral lives,
can do so while ignoring social ills and the problems of structural
violence.\[37\] They appear to do this by limiting their scope of
justice so that it applies only to certain people, drawing some people
within and leaving others outside their circle of justice.\[38\] We care
for members of our own groups, disregarding the welfare of others.
Although societies often have laws and religious prohibitions against
direct violence, structural violence is less likely to result in
punishment. Indeed, even "Good Samaritan" laws designed to encourage
citizens to intervene in emergencies remain a controversial form of
legislation. **[Because the targets of structural violence are those
people with less power in society, children, women, and minority group
members are disproportionately represented]{.underline}**. Structural
violence toward children manifests itself in many ways. Social policies
punish children for their parents' actions; more subtly, children being
raised under conditions of economic distress have lower levels of
cognitive development due to their parents' limited time and resources
to provide cognitive and linguistic stimulation to their children.\[39\]
Structural violence also disproportionately affects mothers worldwide
through a systematic denial of access to health care and other
resources, and even by denying women legal status and rights of
citizenship.\[40\] Similar problems affect minority groups throughout
the world.

## Alternative 

### 2NC Alternative 

#### Challenging the war system holistically is key- weapons focus cuts off movements

**Martin 90** (Brian-, *Uprooting War*,
[http://uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/90uw/uw02.html](http://uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/90uw/uw00.html);
Jacob)

[Focussing on the roots of war, such as political and economic
inequality, suggests that war should be seen as only one of a range of
social problems, and that the elimination of war must go hand in hand
with elimination of other problems]{.underline}. In terms of strategies,
this means that [war should not be given undue attention compared to
other social problem]{.underline}s. [Campaigns to oppose
sexism]{.underline}, heterosexism, economic [exploitation,
racism]{.underline}, poverty, political [repression]{.underline},
alienation [and environmental degradation are also a contribution to the
overall antiwar effort in as much as they are oriented to challenge and
replace oppressive social structures]{.underline}.

An implication of this principle is that [campaigns of different social
movements should be linked at the level of strategy]{.underline}, and
should be mutually stimulating and provide mutual learning. This already
happens to some extent, for example when feminists emphasise the
fostering of aggressiveness in men as a factor in war, or when antiwar
activists support environmentalists opposed to nuclear power.

On the other hand, [antiwar movements]{.underline}, like other social
movements, [often adopt strategies or demands which have little
relevance to other social problems. One example is the demand for a
nuclear freeze]{.underline}, promoted heavily in the United States in
the 1980s. [This demand, that the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and Soviet governments halt new developments in or
additions to their nuclear arsenals, has little immediate relevance to
other social problems]{.underline}. [This is no coincidence. The nuclear
freeze campaign, which is based on influencing state elites by public
pressure, has worked through existing structures rather than attempting
to transform them]{.underline}.

[To claim that]{.underline} the problem of war, or [nuclear
war]{.underline} in particular[, is so pressing that it should be given
priority over other issues is bad politics. It cuts the antiwar movement
off from other social movements vital to opposing war-linked structures.
And it often leads to strategies such as the nuclear freeze which do not
address the roots of war. The aim should not be to set up hierarchies of
oppression, but to link social issues and movements in theory and
action.]{.underline}

[An orientation towards structural change is often connected with
awareness of the connections between social issues]{.underline}. For
example, the British journal Peace News, which has the subtitle \'for
nonviolent revolution\' and is oriented to structural change, features
articles on Third World problems, feminism, workplace democracy and many
other issues.

The judge should endorse our non-violent discursive move as an
[antidote]{.underline} to the affirmative's representations. [Silence is
violence]{.underline}---only the critical approach manifested in our
alternative offers a way out.

William C. **Gay**, Professor of Philosophy at University of North
Carolina at Charlotte, **1998** ("The Practice of Linguistic
Non-Violence," *Peace Review*, Volume 10, Issue 4, December, Available
Online to Subscribing Institutions via Academic Search Elite)

From a pacifist perspective or, even more generally, from a nonviolent
perspective, **[much discourse that calls for an end to violence and war
or that calls for the establishment of peace and social justice actually
places a primacy on ends over means. When the end is primary,
nonviolence may be practiced only so long as it is effective. For the
pacifist and the practitioner of nonviolence, the primary commitment is
to the means. The commitment to nonviolence requires that the
achievement of political goals is secondary. Political goals must be
foregone or at least postponed when they cannot be achieved
nonviolently]{.underline}**. Various activities promote the pursuit of
the respect, cooperation and understanding needed for positive peace and
social justice and for the genuinely pacific discourse that is an
integral part of them. Linguistically, these activities go beyond the
mere removal from discourse of terms that convey biases based on race,
gender, class, and sexual orientation. Open dialogue, especially
face-to-face conversation, is one of the most effective ways of
experiencing that the other is not so alien or alienating. Beyond having
political leaders of various nations meet, we need cultural and
educational exchanges, as well as trade agreements among businesses and
foreign travel by citizens. We can come to regard cultural diversity in
the expression of race, gender, class, and sexual orientation as making
up the harmonies and melodies that together create the song of humanity.
Just as creative and appreciated cooks use a wide variety of herbs and
spices to keep their dishes from being bland, so too can we move from an
image of a culture with diverse components as in a melting pot to one of
a stew that is well seasoned with a variety of herbs and spices. A
pacific discourse that expresses such an affirmation of diversity needs
to be an understood language of inclusion. **[While linguistic violence
often relies on authoritarian, monological, aggressive and calculative
methods, a positively nonviolent discourse is democratic, dialogleal,
receptive, and mediative. A positively nonviolent discourse is not
passive in the sense of avoiding engagement; it is pacific in the sense
of seeking to actively build, from domestic to international levels,
lasting peace and justice. A positively nonviolent discourse provides a
way of perceiving and communicating that frees us to the diversity and
open-endedness of life rather than the sameness and senselessness of
violence. A positively nonviolent discourse can provide the
communicative means to overcome linguistic violence that does not
contradict or compromise its goal at any point during its
pursuit]{.underline}**. **[The first step is breaking our silence
concerning the many forms of violence. We need to recognize that often
silence is violence; frequently, unless we break the silence, we are
being complicitous to the violence of the situation. However, in
breaking the silence, our aim should be to avoid counter-violence, in
its physical forms and in its verbal forms. Efforts to advance peace and
justice should occupy the space between silence and violence. Linguistic
violence can be overcome, but the care and vigilance of the positive
practice of physical and linguistic nonviolence is needed if the gains
are to be substantive, rather than merely formal, and if the goals of
nonviolence are to be equally operative in the means whereby we overcome
linguistic violence and social injustice]{.underline}**.

Hidden in plain sight: [a sprawling bureaucracy designed to justify and
deliver military violence]{.underline}---clothed in the new war
lexicon---to the world. How might one critique this massive network of
violence that has become so enmeshed in our contemporary
geo-socio-political reality? Is there any **[hope for reversing the
expansion of executive violence in the current political
climate]{.underline}**, in which the President enjoys minimal resistance
to his most egregious uses of violence? How does exceptional violence
become routine? Answers to these broad and difficult questions, derived
as they are from the disorientingly vast and hyper-accelerated
retrenchment of our current political situation, are best won through
the broad strokes of what Slavoj Žižek calls **["systemic"
critique.]{.underline}** For Žižek, **[looking squarely at interpersonal
or subjective violences]{.underline}** (e.g., torture, drone strikes),
[**drawn as we may be by their gruesome and immediate appeal, distorts
the critic's broader field of vision**. For a fuller picture, one must
pull one's critical focus back several steps to reveal the deep,
objective structures that undergird the spectacular manifestations of
everyday, subjective violence]{.underline} (Žižek 2008, 1-2).
Immediately, however, one confronts the limit question of Žižek's
mandate: how does one productively draw the boundaries of a system
without too severely dampening the force of objective critique? For
practical purposes

Criticism must precede problem-solving---the alternative is a
prerequisite to the plan.

**[Approaches]{.underline}** to peacemaking and peacekeeping that are
**[derived from traditional statecentric management diplomacy and
conflict-resolution approaches provide narrow frameworks capable only of
addressing a single dimension of conflicts that in their very nature are
multidimensional]{.underline}**. While **[peacemaking and
peacekeeping]{.underline}** are restrictive approaches to ending
conflict, however, conflict-resolution approaches, while essentially
being monodimensional, have recognized and provided impetus for a
broadening of approaches in the context of the human-needs and
human-security debates. Both approaches, to varying degrees,
**[rationalize conflict via \"manageable,\" acultural frameworks so that
conflicts can be reduced to their dominant dynamics]{.underline}**,
according to each approach. First-generation approaches are guilty of
reductionism and consequently undervalue significant aspects of
conflict, and while second-generation approaches allow for a
consideration of subjective issues, their frameworks again tend to
restrict this. First- and second-generation approaches operate by
prioritizing the issues that need to be addressed; first-generation
approaches did this within the Westphalian context, whereas
second-generation approaches expanded this within a human-needs context,
which underlined the inconsistency of the international system\'s
attempts to reconcile state security with human security. Both
approaches have been subject to hybridization in order to produce a more
multidimensional approach to ending conflict\--yet this has meant that
two approaches with contradictory epistemologies, ontologies, and
methodologies have been brought together. This has seen an uncomfortable
merger between state- and human-security-oriented approaches. The
problem with both generations is that **[as approaches to ending
conflict serve \"the task of historical and cultural reproduction in
times of crisis\"]{.underline}**\[29\] **[in favor of dominant actors
and their discourses,]{.underline}** this means that **[they reproduce
the frameworks that underpin the sociopolitical and international
systems that its proponents are constituting and are constituted
by]{.underline}**. This implies that **[before any intervention to make
peace or settle a conflict takes place, there needs to be a critical
understanding of what is being reproduced, why, and whether it is
normatively desirable to do so]{.underline}**.

### AT: Weaponitis 

#### Arms reductions are meaningful \-\-- changes in weapon doctrine prevent us from using those weapons -- Cold War proves

**McLauchlan 91** \-- Gregory McLauchlan, Associate professor of
sociology at the University of Oregon, Ph.D. from UC -- Berkeley,
"Review: Does the Nuclear Arms Race Matter?" Journal of Peace Research,
Vol. 28, No. 3 (Aug., 1991), Published by: Sage Publications, Ltd. p.
328.

**[The authors argue that the difference between any nuclear war and
conventional war is the danger the former will escalate out of
control.]{.underline}** Unfortunately, **[not all political elites and
military planners have accepted this distinction. The core of many of
these questions]{.underline}** **[comes down to the issue of
perception.]{.underline}** The arms race matters if people think it
matters. Nuclear weapons are more likely to be used if leaders think
this can be kept within limits. While in reality changes in the
strategic balance are not militarily meaningful, leaders might think
they are.

Are leaders subject to such misperceptions? Do they believe their own
rhetoric that weapons matter? **[Schwartz and Derber]{.underline}**
think for the most part they do not. Citing the research of Steven Kull
(1983) and others on attitudes of US strategic planners, and historical
studies of international superpower crises, they **[conclude that
leaders have generally been well aware of the risks and consequences of
nuclear war. When leaders have made nuclear threats]{.underline}**
(overt or implied), **[these have been based on political calculations
and risks, not technological assessments.]{.underline}** Moreover, they
offer evidence that in crises leaders have generally exercised a certain
degree of caution, as if suddenly realizing their peacetime rhetoric
regarding the strategic balance, counterforce strategies, 'limited
nuclear options\' etc.. mattered for nothing. Such \`nuclear
schizophrenia\` seems to characterize a great deal of superpower
behavior, especially by US leaders.

**[But perceptions are shaped not only by weapons, but also by
strategies and doctrine. How do we account for the proliferation of new
variations of nuclear strategy in the 1970s and 1980s]{.underline}**,
including a renewed emphasis on both fighting limited nuclear war and
counterforce strategies, **[in a period when the nuclear stockpiles of
the super- powers had reached a total of some 50.000 weapons? Schwartz
and Derber are too willing to treat nuclear strategy and doctrine as
epiphenomenal, and verge on the suggestion that developments in
strategy]{.underline}** and doctrine **[are]{.underline}** in essence
**[part of a cleverly calculated superpower competition of appearances
and bluff.]{.underline}** The danger here is that an **[undeserved
rationality may be imputed to the nuclear past]{.underline}** (and
present).

#### Restrictions on weapons are effective -- reduce use

**McLauchlan 91** \-- Gregory McLauchlan, Associate professor of
sociology at the University of Oregon, Ph.D. from UC -- Berkeley,
"Review: Does the Nuclear Arms Race Matter?" Journal of Peace Research,
Vol. 28, No. 3 (Aug., 1991), Published by: Sage Publications, Ltd. p.

**[Nuclear strategy and doctrine]{.underline}** - however illusory some
of these might be --- **[have mattered more in the history of the arms
race than the]{.underline}** discussion in **[The Nuclear Seduction
implies]{.underline}**. What should peace movements do in the face of
provocative or irrational nuclear strategies? The authors argue they
should expose the falseness and danger of the strategy, but that
opposing weapon systems only gives credence to claims that weapons
matter. The former is certainly necessary, but it is also clear that
**[the proliferation of nuclear strategies has followed closely on the
heels of technological advances in nuclear weaponry. If we take away the
weapons]{.underline}**, peace movements and arms controllers have
argued, **[we take away the basis for some of the most dangerous nuclear
doctrines. Weapon systems can be opposed on grounds broader than those
characterized as weaponitis]{.underline}**, as many have argued.

###  AT: Positive Peace 

#### Negative peace precedes positive peace---absence of war is a prerequisite to social justice.

Jerry **Folk**, Professor of Religious and Peace Studies at Bethany
College, **1978** (\"Peace Education -- Peace Studies Programs: Towards
an Integrated Approach,\" *Peace & Change*, Volume 5, Number 1, Spring,
Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via JSTOR, p. 58)

Those proponents of the positive peace approach who reject out of hand
the work of researchers and educators coming to the field from the
perspective of negative peace too easily forget that **[the prevention
of a nuclear confrontation of global dimensions is the prerequisite for
all other peace research, education, and action. Unless such a
confrontation can be avoided there will be no world left in which to
build positive peace]{.underline}**.^12^ Moreover, **[the blanket
condemnation of]{.underline}** all such **[negative peace]{.underline}**
oriented research, education or action **[as a reactionary attempt to
support and reinforce the status quo is doctrinaire]{.underline}**.
**[Conflict theory and resolution, disarmament studies, studies of the
international system and of international organizations, and integration
studies are in themselves neutral. They do not intrinsically support
either the status quo or revolutionary efforts to change or overthrow
it. Rather they offer a body of knowledge which can be used for either
purpose or for some purpose in between. It is much more logical for
those who understand peace as positive peace to integrate this knowledge
into their own framework and to utilize it in achieving their own
purposes. A balanced peace studies program should therefore offer the
student exposure to the questions and concerns which occupy those who
view the field essentially from the point of view of negative
peace]{.underline}**.^13^

#### Their argument puts the cart before the horse---in order to pursue social justice, we must first ensure the absence of conflict.

Joshua S. **Goldstein**, Professor of International Relations at
American University, **2001** ("Reflections: The Mutuality of Gender and
War,\" *War and Gender*, Published by Cambridge University Press, ISBN
0521001803, p. 411-412)

First, **[peace activists face a dilemma in thinking about causes of war
and working for peace. Many peace scholars and activists support the
approach, \"if you want peace, work for justice.\"]{.underline}** Then,
if one believes that sexism contributes to war, one can work for gender
justice specifically (perhaps among others) in order to pursue peace.
**[This approach]{.underline}** brings strategic allies to the peace
movement (women, labor, minorities), but **[rests on the assumption that
injustices cause war. The evidence]{.underline}** in this book
**[suggests that causality runs at least as strongly the other way. War
is not a product of capitalism, imperialism, gender, innate aggression,
or any other single cause, although all of these influence wars\'
outbreaks and outcomes. Rather, war has in part fueled and sustained
these and other injustices.]{.underline}** ^9^ **[So, \"if you want
peace, work for peace.\" Indeed, if you want justice]{.underline}**
(gender and others), **[work for peace. Causality does not run just
upward through the levels of analysis, from types of individuals,
societies, and governments up to war. It runs downward
too]{.underline}**. Enloe suggests that changes in attitudes towards war
and the military may be the most important way to \"reverse women\'s
oppression.\" The dilemma is that peace work focused on justice brings
to the peace movement energy, allies, and moral grounding, yet, in light
of this book\'s evidence, **[the emphasis on injustice as the main cause
of war seems to be empirically inadequate.]{.underline}** ^10^

#### There is no tradeoff between positive and negative peace---focusing on our war impact does not preclude consideration of structural impacts.

Jerry **Folk,** Professor of Religious and Peace Studies at Bethany
College, **1978** ("Peace Education -- Peace Studies Programs: Towards
an Integrated Approach,\" *Peace & Change*, Volume 5, Number 1, Spring,
Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via JSTOR, p. 59)

**[The conflicting positions held by various researchers, educators, and
activists in the peace studies field can be seen as complementary rather
than contradictory. Tensions, disagreements, and arguments of
considerable intensity are unavoidable and indeed desirable in this as
in other fields of endeavor. Such dialectical tensions ensure a depth
and breadth of perception which one position alone could not produce.
Truth is often paradoxical, and therefore a dialectical approach to it
is most appropriate. Antagonisms insure that the dialectic is kept
alive. They introduce a third dimension into one\'s understanding of
truth and preserve it from petrification and sterility. Therefore,
premature closures, mutual excommunications, and fixations on a
particular but incomplete position or approach should be
avoided]{.underline}**.

#### Their argument is lefty nonsense that results in appeasement and violence---reject their "Peace Studies" agenda.

Peace, peace, peace. In vogue as never before. Yes, **["Peace Studies"
is very hot]{.underline}**, **[even though]{.underline}**, unlike
"Renaissance Studies" or "Canadian Studies," **[there is no actual
subject to analyze. Peace is not a "thing" or a place or a related
series of events. Just as dark is the absence of light, peace --- warm
or cold --- is essentially the absence of war. The rest is opinion and
commentary]{.underline}**. **[Yet Peace Studies has become a huge
academic industry]{.underline}** over the last 40 years. **[The name is
benign]{.underline}** --- what could be more worthwhile in principle
than studies that claim to further what all of us desire? --- **[but its
allegedly disinterested agenda is anything but]{.underline}**. Peace
Studies programs --- the "idealistic" school of conflict resolution as
opposed to the realist schools of military studies, geopolitics and the
like --- began as a response to the threat of nuclear armageddon during
the Cold War. The 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis accelerated their growth.
Then the further upheaval of the Vietnam War prompted lavish donations
from foundations like the Institute for World Order, which gave the
movement academic security and political respectability. But **[Peace
Studies hasn't produced practical prescriptions for managing or
resolving global conflicts, because ideology always trumps objectivity
and pragmatism]{.underline}**. The movement exploits the terminology of
human rights, borrowing lofty catchwords like "empowerment,"
"reconciliation," "ripeness," "rebalancing of power relationships" and
"historic justice." Peaceniks extol the values of dialogue and empathy.
Their promotional materials exude sentimental clichés: "\[We can find\]
ways of working toward a just and harmonious world community." Once past
the rhetoric, though, it is clear that **[peace programs are code for
advocacy of left wing ideology. The "scholarship" exists to put a
respectable face on Western self-loathing]{.underline}**. Apart from
Western "imperialism," which they excoriate nonstop, **[peace "scholars"
do not acknowledge the reality of ideologies that cannot be reasoned
with, or the irrational hatred fuelling our enemies' violent aggression
against us. Neither do they admit the idea of just war or
self-defence]{.underline}** --- at least not for powerful nations (read
America and Israel). Most troubling, **[they tacitly or openly support
terrorism as a permissible strategy for the "disempowered" to redress
real or perceived grievances against the powerful]{.underline}** (read
America and Israel). **[The gurus of the Peace Studies movement are
far-left shills for the world's worst dictators]{.underline}**. In 2007,
for example, the same Canadian Institute for Conflict Resolution that
sponsored this week's conference gave its imprimatur to another, "Peace
as a Profession in the 21st Century." The keynote speaker was Norwegian
professor Johann G altun and g, billed in the conference literature as
"the father of modern peace research." What the publicity omitted was
the fact that Galtung despises the "structural fascism" of "rich,
Western, Christian" democracies admires tyrannies. He believes the
annihilation of Washington, D.C., would be a fair punishment for
America's arrogance. He adores Fidel Castro. In 1974 he mocked the
West's reverence for "persecuted elite personages" like Solzhenitsyn and
Sakharov. He compared the U.S. to Nazi Germany for bombing Kosovo.
Galtung's highest accolades are reserved for Chairman Mao. His gushings
about Mao's "endlessly liberating" China are revealing, but too
sickening to publish in a family newspaper. And this is the moral
quisling Canadian Peace Studies academics choose to honour. But they are
not alone. Brandeis University's Peace Studies chairman justifies
suicide bombings; the director of Purdue University's program is
coeditor of Marxism Today; the Sydney University's Centre for Peace and
Conflict Studies awarded a prize to Hanan Ashrawi, a spokesman for the
terrorist PLO. In the 1980s and again in 1990, human rights activist
Caroline Cox and philosopher Roger Scruton analyzed Peace Studies
curricula. They not only pronounced them bereft of information about the
U.S.S.R., even at the height of the Cold war, but found them to be
intellectually incoherent, riddled with bias and unworthy of academic
status. Katherine Kersten, senior fellow at the Center of the American
Experiment, says Peace Studies programs are "dominated by people of a
certain ideological bent, and \[are\] thus hard to take seriously."
Peace Studies' graduates --- patriotism-sapped converts to
anti-Westernism --- now swarm the globe, staffing left wing NGOs, giving
credibility to the Islamofascism-promoting Cairo Conferences and
applauding the anti-Semitic Durban hatefests. **[Our realists can keep
the literal barbarians from our gates]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[real
peace studies are to be found in military colleges, which seek through
studies of past wars strategies for avoiding present wars where
possible, and where impossible, for waging and ending honourable wars
expeditiously]{.underline}**. **[What is needed are self-respecting
intellectual soldiers to protect us from the "idealistic" barbarians
within our gates: to protect our naive children from these latter-day
Chamberlains and to dash from their lips the poisoned nectar of the
peace racket's dishonourable, self-defeating prescriptions for peace in
our time]{.underline}**.

#### Fear motivates people to pursue constructive means to sustain peace and prevent large-scale catastrophe

**Lifton 01** \-- Robert Jay Lifton, Distinguished Professor of
Psychiatry and Psychology at John Jay College, Illusions of the second
nuclear age, World Policy Journal. New York: Spring
2001. Vol. 18, Iss. 1;  pg. 25-31.

The trouble is that in other ways the [dangers associated with nuclear
weapons are greater than ever]{.underline}: the continuing weapons\--
centered policies in the United States and elsewhere; the difficulties
in controlling nuclear weapons that exist under unstable conditions
(especially in Russia and other areas of the former Soviet Union);2 and
the eagerness and potential capacity of certain nations and \"private\"
groups to acquire and possibly use the weapons. In that sense, the
nuclear quietism is perilous. Or, to put the matter another way, [we no
longer manifest an appropriate degree of fear in relation to actual
nuclear danger]{.underline}. While fear in itself is hardly to be
recommended as a guiding human emotion, [its absence in the face of
danger can lead to catastrophe.]{.underline} We human animals have
built-in fear reactions in response to threat. These reactions help us
to protect ourselves-to step back from the path of a speeding
automobile, or in the case of our ancestors, from the path of a wild
animal. [Fear can be transmuted into constructive planning and
policies]{.underline}: whether for [minimizing vulnerability
to]{.underline} [attacks by wild animals]{.underline}, or for more
[complex contemporary threats]{.underline}. Through fear, [ordinary
people can be motivated to pursue constructive means for sustaining
peace]{.underline}, or at least for [limiting the scope of
violence]{.underline}. Similarly[, in exchanges between world leaders on
behalf of preventing large-scale conflict]{.underline}, a tinge of
[fear]{.underline}-sometimes more than a tinge- [can enable each to feel
the potential bloodshed and suffering that would result from
failure.]{.underline} But with nuclear weapons, our psychological
circuits are impaired. We know that the weapons are around-and we hear
talk about nuclear dangers somewhere \"out there\" -but our minds no
longer connect with the dangers or with the weapons themselves. That
blunting of feeling extends into other areas. One of the many sins for
which advocates of large nuclear stockpiles must answer is the
prevalence of psychic numbing to enormous potential suffering, the
blunting of our ethical standards as human beings. [In the absence of
the sort of threatening nuclear rhetoric the United States and Russia
indulged in during the 1980s, we can all too readily numb ourselves to
everything nuclear, and thereby live as though the weapons pose no
danger, or as though they don\'t exist.]{.underline}
