# Drones Neg Final Masterfile

# CASE 

### Solvency:

#### Even Trump's new drone policy in compliance with the MTCR

(**Stohl 18**, Rachel, the managing at the Stimson Center and directs
the Center's Conventional Defense Program., Stohl was the consultant to
the U.N. ATT process from 2010-2013 and was previously the consultant to
the U.N. Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on the Arms Trade Treaty in
2008 and the U.N. Register for Conventional Arms in 2009., Trump
Administration's New Weapons Export Policies Stress Benefit to U.S.
Economy, Just Security.,
https://www.justsecurity.org/55496/trump-administrations-weapons-export-policies-stress-benefit-u-s-economy/)

The changes under the drone export policy are more tangible than the CAT
policy. There are three notable changes as described in the fact sheet.
The first allows drones to be sold via the State Department's Direct
Commercial Sales (DCS) program, meaning industry can negotiate contracts
with recipients without the involvement of the U.S. government. Second
is the removal of special scrutiny for laser designators, meaning
strike-enabled drones can be made available more widely and more easily.
Third, the policy indicates that drone exports will be subject to
possible enhanced end-use monitoring, instead of obligatory enhanced
end-use monitoring (EUM). EUM is done to ensure that transferred weapons
are where they are supposed to be, in the hands of those that are
supposed to have them, and used in accordance with the terms of
transfer. This means that drone exports will be treated the same as most
other defense articles and will no longer require special export
conditions or end-use checks. [The policy does not eliminate the
"presumption of denial" (a standard which has made it more difficult to
export drones because the sale has to justify its need instead of more
favorable disposition towards making the sale) for Category I drone
exports (those with a range of 300 km and payload of 500 kg) as required
by the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), but the State
Department indicated that they would be looking to update the MTCR to
focus on elements of drones that raise the greatest concern, which is
not necessarily range and payload.]{.underline}

### Plan Flaw

#### Unpiloted is no longer used to describe drones

Merlin 13, Peter, aerospace historian who has been researching the
history of Area 51 since 1984 and has written numerous articles on the
subject. He has also appeared on such television programs as Modern
Marvels, Mystery Hunters, Man-Moment-Machine, Inside Area 51, UFO: Down
To Earth, Return to Area 51, Atomic Journeys, UFO Hunters, MysteryQuest,
and others, Collusion Course, NASA,
[file:///C:/Users/jack\_/Downloads/Crash%20Course.pdf](file:///C:\Users\jack_\Downloads\Crash%20Course.pdf),

[Terminology used to describe these craft is constantly
evolvin]{.underline}g. [The term "]{.underline}unmanned" was replaced
with "[unpiloted]{.underline}" or "uninhabited," but both [were
ultimately considered inadequate]{.underline}. In the popular press, the
word "drone" is frequently used to describe any type of aircraft that
does not accommodate an onboard crew. [Unfortunately, this gives the
impression that the aircraft is simply a mindless robot. Nothing could
be further from the truth; there are always numerous people involved,
serving as operators, monitors, and ground crew]{.underline}

**Unmanned Aerial Vehicle is a term of art that applies to the catergory
1 drones so regulating "unpiloted aerial vehicles" does nothing**

**(Rivera 13,** Joshua, Bachelor of Science Syracuse University:

Such A Dirty
Word?](https://www.fastcompany.com/3022485/how-did-drone-become-such-a-dirty-word),

[What the average person on the street calls "drones" have different
nomenclatures inside the five-sided building.]{.underline} And if you
use the wrong term--say, calling something a UAV (unmanned aerial
vehicle) versus RPA (remotely piloted aircraft) in a story--you'll hear
about it, either from irate officials or irate readers.

[It's not just a matter of technical nomenclature, either.]{.underline}
The etymology of the word "drone" in this context--meaning "pilotless
aircraft"--goes back to the 1930s. The British Royal Navy had developed
a radio-controlled aircraft for the purpose of anti-aircraft gunnery
practice, a training exercise far too dangerous to have a live pilot
participate in. They called the aircraft the Queen Bee. When Adm.
William Standley, the chief of U.S. Naval Operations, saw a
demonstration of the Queen Bee, he then commissioned a similar program,
calling his aircraft a drone as an homage to the Queen Bee. The name
stuck--but it wasn't until recently that the term meant anything more
than an automated aircraft to be shot at.

[For the more versatile, expensive machines that are controlled remotely
like the oft-photographed Predator, the proper designation is either UAV
or UAS: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle or Unmanned Aerial System.]{.underline}

### MTCR GUIDELINES (MUST READ)

#### Category 1 Items must meet a minimum payload/ range threshold 

(**MTCR**, Missile Technology Control Regime, MTCR Guidelines and the
Equipment, Software and Technology Annex,

[Greatest restraint is applied to]{.underline} what are known as
[Category I items]{.underline}. [These items include complete rocket
systems (including ballistic missiles, space launch vehicles and
sounding rockets) and unmanned air vehicle systems (including cruise
missiles systems, target and reconnaissance drones) with capabilities
exceeding a 300km/500kg range/payload threshold]{.underline}; production
facilities for such systems; [and major sub-systems
including]{.underline} rocket stages, re-entry vehicles, rocket
engines[, guidance systems]{.underline} and warhead mechanisms.

### XT- MTCR GUIDELINES (not really sure how or why anyone would contest this)

[Category I items include complete rocket and unmanned aerial vehicle
systems (including ballistic missiles, space launch vehicles, sounding
rockets, cruise missiles, target drones, and reconnaissance drones),
capable of delivering a payload of at least 500 kg to a range of at
least 300 km]{.underline}, [their major complete subsystems (such as
rocket stages, engines, guidance sets, and re-entry vehicles), and
related software and technology]{.underline}, as well as specially
designed production facilities for these items. Pursuant to the MTCR
Guidelines, exports of Category I items are subject to an unconditional
strong presumption of denial regardless of the purpose of the export and
are licensed for export only on rare occasions. Additionally, exports of
production facilities for Category I items are prohibited absolutely.

### Circumvention 

#### No solvency: UAV services are used to undermine MTCR authority and would still result in drones in the SCS 

(**Lichtenbaum 15**, Peter, Partner at Covington law ranked in Band 1
for Export Controls & Sanctions in *Chambers USA* (2015), UAV EXPORT
CONTROLS AND REGULATORY CHALLENGES, Stimson,
<https://www.stimson.org/sites/default/files/file-attachments/ECRC%20Working%20Group%20Report.pdf>)

For both commercial and military UAV exports, encourage [the export of
"UAV services]{.underline}" that [would mitigate the impact of MTCR
restrictions by allowing recipients to receive the benefits of Category
I UAVs without the transfer of U.S. "jurisdiction or
control]{.underline}" and, for Category II UAVs, mitigate the impact of
strict controls on the export of UAVs posing particular concerns.

### XT-Circumvention

#### Modifying export rules causes companies to switch to UAV services which still decks solvency 

**(Gormly and Spier 03,** Dennis M. senior research fellow at the
Matthew B. Ridgway Center for International Security Studies and has
testified before Congress on national security issues. The author of
three other book the Office of the Secretary of Defense to start the
Office of Non- Proliferation Policy. For 10 years he helped design,
negotiate, and implement the Missile Technology Control Regime. In
recognition of his work on the international negotiations that led to
the MTCR, the Secretary of Defense awarded him the Meritorious Civilian
Service Medal. Speier is widely credited with being \"the father of the
MTCR.\"  He later helped initiate the Defense Department's Office of
Counter-Proliferation Policy., Controlling Unmanned Air Vehicles: New
Challenges, The non-proliferation Review,
<https://www.nonproliferation.org/wp-content/uploads/npr/102gorm.pdf>)

A safer option supplementing [the policy of working within the Category
1 rules might be]{.underline} to develop the UAV industry in manner
similar to that of the space launch industry. This would involve
[providing "services" but not the transfer of hardware beyond the
jurisdiction or control of the state considering a sale.]{.underline} In
all but the most advanced nations, many elements of UAV operations such
satellite imagery for the selection of operating areas and satellite
communications for retrieval of data are already provided on a service
rather than an ownership basis. UAV services would extend this principle
by having the supplier nation maintain and operate UAVs while the
recipient nation directed the operations and received data gather by the
UAV.

[This would be a cultural change for the young UAV industry, but it
might make military sense]{.underline}. As Thomas Cassidy, president and
CEO of General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, said with respect to the
Preadator system (which is growing over the Category 1 threshold), "The
last thing \[a forward commander\] need is to maintain and operate
airplanes. What he needs is intelligence support---somebody looking and
then piping video directly to him on a little TV set that we've already
made for the special forces people.

[Another aerospace veteran, speaking off the record, anticipates that
UAV services could be a lucrative business model.]{.underline} Such
services would resemble the early and profitable IBM decision to market
computer services in preference to hardware sales. UAVs might be painted
in the colors of the nation purchasing the services. But the exporting
government could retain jurisdiction and control of its UAVs by
licensing its own nationals to maintain and operate the vehicles in and
over territories approved in an export license.

### XT- No Solvency to SCS advantage

#### ScanEagles are category 2 drones so the aff can't resolve their presence in the SCS

#### No war in the South China Sea

[An all-out war in the South China Sea is unlikely at this stage even
though military giants the United States and China appear to be
positioning themselves aggressively in the disputed waters of the
maritime region]{.underline}, analysts said.\
\
The Philippines entered the fray last week when Manila assured Beijing
that it would not take part in maritime exercises in the sea being
purportedly planned by the U.S., in deference to Chinese leader Xi
Jinping who is scheduled to visit the country next month. Washington,
however, has officially denied that such plans were in the offing, as
first reported by American news channel CNN two weeks ago.\
\
[Both the U.S. and China are merely posturing, according to Jay
Batongbacal, director of the Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of
the Sea at the University of the Philippines.\]{.underline}
\
"[I do not think we are moving toward war," Batongbacal told BenarNews.
"Despite the rhetoric, it is not in either country's interest to engage
in a full-blown war with each other."\
\
While the U.S. had not "restrained" itself from armed conflict with
other states such as Afghanistan, Iraq or Panama, Washington may choose
to tread carefully vis-à-vis China, which can possibly match it in
"nuclear capability" and "war fighting capability]{.underline}," he
said.\
\
[And directly challenging Beijing over the South China Sea remains
unpopular among members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN),]{.underline} which recently moved toward a collective response
of appeasement.\
\
"[A serious armed conflict is also not in the interest of any one of the
countries in the region despite their issues with China,]{.underline}"
Batongbacal said.\
\
"ASEAN as a whole does not want to become a battleground for the super
powers, and likely prefers a more moderate, mediatory role between the
two competing powers."

#### No SCS war---conflict won't escalate past provocations

**Li**, Director of the Department of International Strategy at the
Institute of World Economics and Politics, Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, 6/19/**'15**

(Xue, "The US and China Won\'t See Military Conflict Over the South
China Sea", The Diplomat)

In a recent piece on the South China Sea disputes, I argued that "the
ASEAN claimants are largely staying behind the scenes while external
powers take center stage." Based on recent developments on the South
China Sea issue, it seems the U.S. will not only be a 'director' but an
actor. We saw this clearly on May 20, when [the U.S. military sent
surveillance aircraft over three islands controlled by
Beijing]{.underline}.

However, **[[this does not]{.mark} necessary [mean the
S]{.mark}]{.underline}**outh **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea [**[will spark a U.S.-China military
conflict]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

As a global hegemon, the United States' main interest lies in
maintaining the current international order as well as peace and
stability. Regarding the South China Sea, U.S. interests include
ensuring peace and stability, freedom of commercial navigation, and
military activities in exclusive economic zones. Maintaining the current
balance of power is considered to be a key condition for securing these
interests---and a rising China determined to strengthen its hold on
South China Sea territory is viewed as a threat to the current balance
of power. In response, the U.S. launched its "rebalance to Asia"
strategy. In practice, the U.S. has on the one hand strengthened its
military presence in Asia-Pacific, while on the other hand supporting
ASEAN countries, particularly ASEAN claimants to South China Sea
territories.

This position has included high-profile rhetoric by U.S. officials. In
2010, then-U.S. Secretary of State Hilary Clinton spoke at the ASEAN
Regional Forum in Hanoi about the South China Sea, remarks that aligned
the U.S. with Southeast Asia's approach to the disputes. At the 2012
Shangri-La Dialogue, then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta explained
how the United States will rebalance its force posture as part of
playing a "deeper and more enduring partnership role" in the
Asia-Pacific region. In 2014, then-Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel
called out China's "destabilizing, unilateral activities asserting its
claims in the South China Sea." His remarks also came at the Shangri-La
dialogue, while China's HY-981 oil rig was deployed in the waters around
the Paracel Islands. In 2015, U.S. officials have openly pressured China
to scale back its construction work in the Spratly islands and have sent
aircraft to patrol over islands in the Spratly that are controlled by
China. These measures have brought global attention to the South China
Sea.

However, [if we look at the]{.underline} practical [significance of the
remarks, [there are]{.mark} several [limiting
factors]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The interests]{.mark} at
stake]{.underline} in the South China Sea [[are **not core national
interests for the U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates. Meanwhile, [[the U.S.-Philippine
alliance is not as important]{.mark} as the U.S.-Japan
alliance]{.underline}, and [U.S. ties with other ASEAN countries are
even weaker]{.underline}. [[Given]{.mark} **U.S.-China mutual [economic
dependence]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} [China's]{.mark} comprehensive
national [strength, **the U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[is unlikely to]{.mark} go so far
as [hav]{.mark}ing a [military confrontation with
China]{.mark}]{.underline}** over the South China Sea. Barack [Obama,
the 'peace president']{.underline} who withdrew the U.S. military from
Iraq and Afghanistan, [is even less likely to fight with
China]{.underline} for the South China Sea.

As for the U.S. interests in the region, [Washington is]{.underline}
surely [aware that China has not affected the freedom of]{.underline}
commercial [navigation in these waters so far]{.underline}. And as I
noted in my earlier piece, Beijing is developing its stance and could
eventually recognize the legality of military activities in another
country's EEZ (see, for example, the China-Russia joint military
exercise in the Mediterranean).

Yet when it comes to China's large-scale land reclamation in the Spratly
Islands (and on Woody Island in the Paracel Islands), Washington worries
that Beijing will conduct a series of activities to strengthen its
claims on the South China Sea, such as establishing an air defense
identification zone (ADIZ) or advocating that others respect a
200-nautical mile (370 km) EEZ from its islands. Meanwhile, the 2014 oil
rig incident taught Washington that ASEAN claimants and even ASEAN as a
whole could hardly play any effective role in dealing with China's land
reclamation. Hence, the U.S. has no better choice than to become
directly involved in this issue.

At the beginning, the United States tried to stop China through private
diplomatic mediation, yet it soon realized that this approach was not
effective in persuading China. So Washington started to tackle the issue
in a more aggressive way, such as encouraging India, Japan, ASEAN, the
G7, and the European Union to pressure Beijing internationally.
Domestically, U.S. officials from different departments and different
levels have opposed China's 'changing the status quo' in this area.

Since 2015, Washington has increased its pressure on China. It sent the
USS Fort Worth, a littoral combat ship, to sail in waters near the
Spratly area controlled by Vietnam in early May. U.S. official are also
considering sending naval and air patrols within 12 nautical miles of
the Spratly Islands controlled by China.

Washington has recognized that it could hardly stop China's construction
in Spratly Islands. Therefore, it has opted to portray Beijing as a
challenger to the status quo, at the same time moving to prevent China
from establishing a South China Sea ADIZ and an EEZ of 200 nautical
miles around its artificial islands. This was the logic behind the U.S.
sending a P-8A surveillance plane with reporters on board to approach
three artificial island built by China. China issued eight warnings to
the plane; the U.S. responded by saying the plane was flying through
international airspace.

Afterwards, U.S. Defense Department spokesman, Army Col. Steve Warren,
said there could be a potential "freedom of navigation" exercise within
12 nautical miles of the artificial islands. If this approach were
adopted, it would back China into a corner; hence it's a unlikely the
Obama administration will make that move.

As the U.S. involvement in the South China Sea becomes more aggressive
and high-profile, the dynamic relationship between China and the United
States comes to affect other layers of the dispute (for example,
relations between China and ASEAN claimants or China and ASEAN in
general). To some extent, [the]{.underline} South China Sea [dispute has
developed into a balance of power tug-of-war between the U.S. and China,
**yet [both sides will not take]{.mark} [the risk]{.mark} of military
confrontation**]{.underline}. As Foreign Minister Wang Yi put it in a
recent meeting with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, "as for the
differences, [our attitude is it is okay to have differences as long as
we could avoid]{.underline} misunderstanding, and even more importantly,
avoid [miscalculation]{.underline}."

For its part, China is determined to build artificial islands and
several airstrips in the Spratlys, which I argue would help promote the
resolution of SCS disputes. But it's worth noting that if China
establishes an ADIZ and advocates a 200 nautical miles EEZ (as the U.S.
fears), it would push ASEAN claimants and even non-claimants to stand by
the United States. Obviously, the potential consequences contradict with
China's "One Belt, One Road" strategy.

In February 2014, in response to reports by Japan's Asahi Shimbun that a
South China Sea ADIZ was imminent, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs
hinted that China would not necessarily impose an ADIZ. "The Chinese
side has yet to feel any air security threat from the ASEAN countries
and is optimistic about its relations with the neighboring countries and
the general situation in the South China Sea region," a spokesperson
said.

Since the "Belt and Road" is Beijing's primary strategic agenda for the
coming years, it is crucial for China to strengthen its economic
relationship with ASEAN on the one hand while reducing ASEAN claimants'
security concerns on the other hand. As a result, it should accelerate
the adjustment of its South China Sea policy; clarify China's stand on
the issue, and propose China's blueprint for resolving the disputes.

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} South China Sea [[dispute]{.mark} has
[developed a seasonal pattern]{.mark}]{.underline}, where [[the first
half]{.mark} [of the year is]{.mark} focused on [conflict]{.mark}s, and
[the second]{.mark} half tends to emphasize
**[cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Considering its timing at the
peak of 'conflict season,' the Shangri-La Dialogue serves as a hot spot.
Since 2012, the Shangri-La Dialogue has become a platform for the U.S.
and China to tussle on the South China Sea, with the U.S. being
proactive and China reactive. (Incidentally, this partly explains why
China is upgrading Xiangshan Forum as an alternative dialogue platform).
This year was no exception, as the U.S. worked hard to draw the world's
attention to the Shangri-La Dialogue this year.

But audiences should be aware that [aggressive statements]{.underline}
at the Shangri-La Dialogue [are not totally representative of U.S.-China
relations]{.underline}. After all, [these statements are made by
military rather than political elites]{.underline}. Cooperation will be
the key when the U.S. and China have their Strategic and Economic
Dialogue in late June, with the ASEAN Regional Forum and other meetings
following later this summer.

### XT -- No War/No Escalation

#### Reputation costs prevent war in the South China Sea [despite escalating tensions]{.underline} -- no fighting since 1988

**Huang**, Assistant Professor of Political Science, May 13 **2015**

(Chin-Hao, "Security Dimensions of China's Relations with Southeast
Asia," Testimony before the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review
Commission,
http://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Huang_Written%20Testimony_5.13.2015%20Hearing.pdf)

In the last few months, [with many of the claimant states fortifying
their claims in the South China Sea]{.underline}, [it is curious that
[the **conflict remains of**]{.mark}]{.underline} relatively **[[low
frequency and intensity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. What does restraint mean
in practice, especially with regard to the absence of the use of force
by claimant states in the South China Sea?

Any proposal to militarize the dispute with the use of force contains
great risk because an attempt to change any one aspect could open a
Pandora's Box of issues and bring the rival claimant states to the brink
of war. [The use of [force]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[carries
**enormous social repercussions and costs**]{.mark}
[that]{.mark}]{.underline} once triggered [[would amount to major
status-loss]{.underline}, **[tarnished image and reputation regionally
and globally]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [This aversion to be an outlier and
pariah state in the international community alters the claimant states'
consideration on the use of force]{.underline} in settling the
territorial disputes in the South China Sea. [In
particular]{.underline}, [[for China]{.underline}, [the desire to attain
the status of a major power]{.underline}]{.mark} also **[[restrains its
policy options on the maritime disputes]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
identity of major powers has had different status markers. [In
contemporary international politics]{.underline}, [major powers are
often seen as those leading and upholding international institutions
that contribute to stable interstate relations and global
governance]{.underline}, as opposed to major powers of the past that
rely purely on military conquests. This incentivizes China to uphold or
at least not disrupt the status quo and to give pause or even abandon
militarist tendencies.

[[**Even** in such a high-tension]{.underline}]{.mark}, [anarchic
security [environment]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [restraint by each of the
claimant states may thus help explain why there have been **no
battle-related deaths**]{.underline}]{.mark} between two armed forces
[in the South China Sea since]{.underline} the Fiery Cross confrontation
in [1988]{.underline}. Instead, [the claimant states have engaged with
one another in]{.underline} other forms [low-level
contestation]{.underline}. [In each year]{.underline} from 1994 to 2013
(see Graph 1 below), [the number of]{.underline} incidents, including
but not limited to [surveillance]{.underline}, [arrests]{.underline},
[seizures]{.underline}, [and expelling remained under
double-digits]{.underline}. [1999 saw]{.underline} a total of [seven
incidents and clashes]{.underline} -- [the highest number]{.underline}
during that timeframe -- that occurred between claimant states in the
South China Sea. Cumulatively, the Philippines accounted for 14
incidents involving the deployment of its naval vessels and surveillance
planes, nearly twice as many times as China's instigation in such
incidents. [[For a region with what **appears to be intensifying
regional rivalries**]{.underline}, [it is remarkably surprising to see
the low levels of incidents and minor clashes]{.underline}, [**let
alone** direct military confrontation]{.underline}.]{.mark}

#### Claimant states prefer [stability]{.underline} and [diplomacy]{.underline} -- prefer our [data]{.underline} to their conventional narrative

**Huang**, Assistant Professor of Political Science, May 13 **2015**

(Chin-Hao, "Security Dimensions of China's Relations with Southeast
Asia," Testimony before the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review
Commission,
http://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Huang_Written%20Testimony_5.13.2015%20Hearing.pdf)

[The conventional wisdom points to China's recent maritime actions as
aggressive]{.underline}, [revisionist]{.underline}, [and disruptive to
regional stability]{.underline}. To many, Beijing's aspirations in the
South China Sea mirror-image what other rising powers have done in the
past: establish blue water extensions of its territorial borders to
build an oceanic empire. [That the claimant states in the South China
Sea are taking steps to extend their sovereign jurisdiction unilaterally
to guarantee their access to natural resources indicate rising
tensions]{.underline}, [competition]{.underline}, [and
confrontation]{.underline} that will only intensify in the years ahead.

If China's actions are clear departures from its baseline policies, then
the narrative about the dangers that an increasingly aggressive and
confident China portends for the region is probably accurate. For
example, the sudden discovery of substantial deposits of natural
resources such as oil and gas in the contested seabed could be a trigger
point for rapid escalation. Or, perhaps China may unilaterally decide to
hasten the "salami-slicing" strategy and use force because, put simply,
it can. China could even be emboldened to stake out its own sphere of
influence to counter or even undermine U.S. role in Southeast Asia, with
military build-up and deterrence at the forefront in the contested seas.

But, [if the conventional wisdom that territoriality]{.underline},
[resources]{.underline}, [and power projection are all so central to
China's strategic priorities]{.underline} in its latest maritime
adventures, [[it is]{.mark} equally [important to probe deeper and
further on this puzzle]{.mark}]{.underline}[: [why hasn't a regional
war]{.underline}---**[even]{.underline}** if **[a limited
one]{.underline}**---[break out]{.underline}]{.mark} [between China and
the other claimant states in the South China Sea[?]{.mark}]{.underline}
In other words, to what degree is the South China Sea---and the region
more broadly---really "ripe for rivalry?"

[I offer a slightly different view from the standard]{.underline},
[alarmist narrative]{.underline}. [While lowlevel confrontations have
occurred]{.underline}, there is no clear pattern (yet) that the clashes
are escalating in lockstep to a militarized conflict and outright
balancing in Southeast Asia. In fact, a closer reading of regional
trends, and a comparison of [[**observable data** lead to the]{.mark}
preliminary [conclusion that **even in**]{.mark}]{.underline} one of
**[[the most uncertain security environments]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[China and the other claimant [states appear to be seeking ways to
**manage relations with each other that emphasize restraint and
reciprocity**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[rather than a military
escalation]{.underline}**]{.mark} in the South China Sea.

This testimony provides an attempt to more carefully assess the
developments in the South China Sea. To do so, I compare across time to
see how different China's current actions are from past behavior and
analyzes them across the region. This provides one way to assess what
China and the other key claimant states are actually doing, in addition
to what they are saying, and the degree to which the region has
heightened threat perceptions about China's behavior in the South China
Sea. In particular, I look at three common issues and claims about
increasing aggression in the South China Sea, namely: (1) militarization
of the conflict; (2) oil and natural resources; and (3) the likelihood
of China establishing an air defense identification zone in the South
China Sea.

Why is this important for U.S. security interests in the Southeast Asia?
Put simply, [if the South China Sea presents a more limited existential
security threat to any of the Southeast Asian claimant states than we
commonly presume]{.underline}, [then the strategic way
forward]{.underline} with regards to the U.S. rebalancing strategy to
the region [would need to]{.underline} move beyond security deterrence
and militarization and begin to [emphasize]{.underline} more on
[political and diplomatic leadership]{.underline} and forging stronger
economic partnerships with Southeast Asia. Equally important, as
regional governments' interests begin to converge in Southeast Asia and
align ever more closely In their positions over the territorial disputes
in the South China Sea, Washington should support this regional effort
and allow for ASEAN to come up with a unified and more powerful,
collective bargaining voice vis-à-vis China.

I. **[[Restrained Militarization]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[[Direct military confrontation in the South China Sea has been
surprisingly low]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The last time an actual military
battle occurred in the South China Sea was **[nearly thirty years
ago]{.mark}** in 1988]{.underline} at the Fiery Cross Reef. Claiming
that it was carrying out a scientific mission on behalf of the UN
Educational, Scientific, and Cultural 3 Organization (UNESCO), the
Chinese government dispatched Chinese naval vessels to the Fiery Cross
Reef in the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea to build observations
stations. Vietnam, which had previously claimed the Fiery Cross Reef,
lodged formal complaints and sent armed forces to disrupt the Chinese
construction of the observation towers on the reef. [[An]{.mark} [armed
confrontation **lasting 28 minutes** ensued]{.mark}]{.underline}, [with
**75 Vietnamese personnel killed**]{.underline} or missing and three
Vietnamese naval ships sunk or set ablaze. Since the armed
confrontation, the Vietnamese Defense Ministry has gradually fortified
and expanded its presence in 29 islets and reefs in the Spratly Islands,
making Vietnam the claimant state with the most number of islets and
reefs under its control in the South China Sea.

#### No escalation -- countries are relying on civilian deployments in the South China Sea

**Huang**, Assistant Professor of Political Science, May 13 **2015**

(Chin-Hao, "Security Dimensions of China's Relations with Southeast
Asia," Testimony before the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review
Commission,
http://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Huang_Written%20Testimony_5.13.2015%20Hearing.pdf)

More important, [China's more recent approach to enforcing its claims in
the South China Sea has relied on the Coast Guard and other civilian
agencies]{.underline}, [rather than resorting to the]{.underline}
People's Liberation Army [Navy]{.underline} (PLAN) forces. The Bureau of
Fisheries Administration has increased the number of fleets in the South
China Sea and Coast Guard patrols in the high seas have increased as
well. But, to date, [[Beijing remains wary of deploying naval assets to
defend its territorial claims]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[unlike in the
late 1980s and early 1990s]{.underline}** where it used armed forces as
a first resort to resolve its competing claims in the South China Sea.

[Internally]{.underline}, [a number of recent changes occurred to shape
the decision-making processes]{.underline} with regards to the South
China Sea. [The establishment of a Central]{.underline} Leading [Small
Group]{.underline} on the Protection of Maritime Interests in 2012 [drew
senior officials from the]{.underline} State Oceanic Administration
(SOA), [Ministry of Foreign Affairs]{.underline} (MFA), Ministry of
Public Security (MPS), Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), and the PLA Navy.
Most notably, [a majority of the officials in the working group
represent civilian agencies and interests and serve as a counterweight
to armed and naval forces in the decision-making process]{.underline}.
At the National People's Congress in March 2012, Chinese officials also
formalized plans to restructure China's main maritime law enforcement
agencies. In particular, four of the major maritime law enforcement
forces (e.g., SOA maritime surveillance forces; MPS coast guard forces;
MOA fishery enforcement forces, and custom administration's maritime
antismuggling police) will be merged as part of SOA with operations
supervised by MPS. [[Relying on these civilian agencies appears to be
**a deliberate choice** and suggests that **China has sought to limit
the potential for escalation**]{.mark} through how it chooses to enforce
its claims to maritime rights]{.underline}. On the other hand, an
explicit shift to using naval assets -- and replacing them with civilian
and other law enforcement agencies -- against fishing vessels and naval
forces from other claimant states in the South China Sea would point to
greater Chinese assertiveness.

[Interestingly]{.underline}, [the Philippines and Vietnam]{.underline},
two of the key claimant states in the South China Sea, [have also been
placing greater efforts to build up their coast guards]{.underline} (see
Table 1 below) [and exercise a greater degree of restraint from
deploying their naval forces]{.underline}, [all the while [military
expenditures on hard naval and military assets remain relatively
constant]{.mark} in the last ten years]{.underline} from 2005-2014, as
measured through defense spending as percentage of key Southeast Asian
government's spending (see Graph 2 below). The Philippines' Coast Guard,
for example, will expand to 10,000 personnel by 2016 and its operational
budget of nearly \$100 million for 2014. Additionally, the Philippine
Coast Guard will continue to make new acquisitions of patrol and coastal
combatant equipment from Japan, Australia, and the United States in the
coming years. Likewise, Vietnam's National Assembly recently allocated
nearly \$750 million from its 2013 State and Central budget for its
fisheries surveillance and coast guard forces. Joint training of
regional coast guards with countries like Japan has also taken place or
is in the planning phases.

#### Consensus among Chinese leaders to avoid escalation

**Huang**, Assistant Professor of Political Science, May 13 **2015**

Asia," Testimony before the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review
Commission,

More important, [in China]{.underline}, [a number of influential
military strategists have]{.underline} also [concurred with the need for
more robust civilian forces and agencies to help patrol the maritime
borders in the South China Sea]{.underline}. In "Notes on Maritime
Security Strategy in the New Period in the New Century," for example, a
notable article published in [China's most prestigious military
journal]{.underline}, 中国军事科学 \[China Military Science\]
[argues]{.underline}, "[to safeguard the EEZ]{.underline}, [it is not
usual to employ military forces]{.underline}[. [If military forces are
employed, they will often expand the scope of the
incident]{.underline}]{.mark}, causing the situation to become more and
more complicated ... To resolve such problems, many countries have coast
guards." Moreover, [[the piece is quite emphatic in stating that
negotiation has been and will remain China's approach to maritime
territorial disputes]{.underline}]{.mark}, asserting that "Since the
founding of the new China, under the direction of Mao ... Deng ... Jiang
... and Hu ... the Chinese government has used the foreign policy
instruments of 'negotiations, declarations of differences, and adopting
measures to build trust' ... which has yielded obvious successes ...
resolving to a large extent the problems of maritime rivalry and
preventing hidden dangers." [[The article]{.underline}]{.mark},
[published in such a high profile journal on a topic of great
sensitivity]{.underline}, [[reflects the **emerging consensus in China's
senior military leadership circle**]{.underline}.]{.mark}

#### No SCS war

[Unlike its]{.underline} recent [behavior in the East China Sea,
[Beijing's approach toward the **S**]{.mark}]{.underline}outh
**[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea disputes
[[has]{.underline}]{.mark} traditionally [[been one of **conflict
deescalation**. Beijing's clear preference has been to manage]{.mark}
such [tensions **bilaterally**. Following]{.mark} a period where an
increase in Chinese maritime patrols led to]{.underline} a rise in the
number of [[clashes with Vietnamese]{.underline}]{.mark} (and
Philippine) [[vessels]{.underline}]{.mark}, for instance, [[Beijing and
Hanoi reached agreement]{.underline}]{.mark} in October 2011
[on]{.underline} principles for **[[settling]{.mark} maritime
[disputes]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Likewise [in June 2013, China and
Vietnam agreed to establish [new hotlines]{.mark} to [assist with
managing incidents]{.mark} at sea and dealing with fishing
disputes]{.underline}.32 [[Beijing has]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[shown]{.underline}]{.mark} some **[[willingness to take the
multilateral route]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Most famously, [China signed
a non-binding "Declaration on Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea"
with ASEAN in]{.underline} November [2002]{.underline}. While protracted
progress continues, [the [official position of]{.mark} both [China and
ASEAN remains]{.mark} to establish **[a]{.mark} legally [binding]{.mark}
[code of conduct]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the South China Sea [intended
to [incorporate mechanisms for **avoiding incidents at sea, crisis
management**]{.mark}**, confidence building measures, and joint
development**]{.underline}.33 Beijing has certainly not shown similar
flexibility in relation to any of its other publicly-declared "core
interests." At China's insistence, for example, discussion of Taiwan is
strictly off limits in Asia's multilateral forums.

#### Won't escalate

**Thayer 13** (Carlyle A. Thayer is Emeritus Professor at the University
of New South Wales, Australian Defence Force Academy, Canberra. The
ideas in this paper were first presented at the Annual Conference of the
Association for Asian Studies held at San Diego, 22 March 2013., "Why
China and the US won't go to war over the South China Sea",
<http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2013/05/13/why-china-and-the-us-wont-go-to-war-over-the-south-china-sea/>)

China's increasing assertiveness in [the]{.underline}
**[S]{.underline}**outh **[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea is
challenging US primacy in the Asia Pacific.

[Even before Washington announced its official policy of rebalancing its
force posture to the Asia Pacific]{.underline}, [the United States had
undertaken steps to strengthen its military posture by deploying more
nuclear attack submarines to the region and negotiating]{.underline}
arrangements with Australia to rotate Marines through Darwin. Since
then, the United States has deployed Combat Littoral Ships to Singapore
and is negotiating new arrangements for greater military access to the
Philippines.

But **[these developments do not presage armed conflict between China
and the United States]{.underline}**. [The]{.underline}
**[P]{.underline}**eople's **[L]{.underline}**iberation
**[A]{.underline}**rmy Navy [has been circumspect in its involvement in
**S**]{.underline}outh **[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea
[territorial disputes,]{.underline} [and the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has been careful to
avoid being entrapped by regional allies in their territorial disputes
with China. Armed conflict between China and the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [in the **S**]{.underline}outh
**[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea **[appears
unlikely.]{.underline}**

Another, more probable, scenario is that [both countries will find a
modus vivendi enabling them to collaborate to maintain security in the
**S**]{.underline}outh **[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea.
The [Obama]{.underline} administration [has repeatedly emphasised that
its policy of rebalancing to Asia **is not directed at containing
China**]{.underline}. For example, Admiral Samuel J. Locklear III,
Commander of the US Pacific Command, recently stated, 'there has also
been criticism that the Rebalance is a strategy of containment. This is
not the case ... it is a strategy of collaboration and cooperation'.

However, a review of past US--China military-to-military interaction
indicates that an agreement to jointly manage security in the South
China Sea is unlikely because of continuing strategic mistrust between
the two countries. This is also because the currents of regionalism are
growing stronger.

As such, a third scenario is more likely than the previous two: that
[China and the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [will maintain a relationship of cooperation
and friction.]{.underline} In this scenario, [both countries work
separately to secure their interests through multilateral
institutions]{.underline} [such as]{.underline} the East Asia Summit,
the [ASEAN]{.underline} Defence Ministers' Meeting Plus and the Enlarged
ASEAN Maritime Forum[. But they also continue to engage each other on
points of mutual interest]{.underline}. [The Pentagon has consistently
sought to keep channels of communication open with China through three
established bilateral mechanisms]{.underline}: **[D]{.underline}**efense
**[C]{.underline}**onsultative **[T]{.underline}**alks,
[the]{.underline} Military Maritime Consultative Agreement
([MMCA]{.underline}), [and the]{.underline} **[D]{.underline}**efense
**[P]{.underline}**olicy **[C]{.underline}**oordination
**[T]{.underline}**alks.

On the one hand, these multilateral mechanisms reveal very little about
US--China military relations. [Military-to-military contacts between the
two countries have gone through repeated cycles of cooperation and
suspension]{.underline}, meaning that it has not been possible to
isolate purely military-to-military contacts from their political and
strategic settings.

On the other hand, [the channels have accomplished]{.underline} the
following: [continuing exchange visits by high-level defence
officials]{.underline}; [regular Defense Consultation
Talks]{.underline}; [continuing working-level discussions under the
MMCA;]{.underline} agreement on the '7-point consensus'; **[and no
serious naval incidents]{.underline}** since the 2009 USNS Impeccable
affair. [They have also helped to ensure continuing exchange visits by
senior military officers]{.underline}; the [initiation of a Strategic
Security Dialogue]{.underline} as part of the ministerial-level
Strategic & Economic Dialogue process; [agreement to hold meetings
between coast guards;]{.underline} [and agreement on a new working group
to draft principles to establish a framework for military-to-military
cooperation.]{.underline}

So the bottom line is that, [despite ongoing frictions in their
relationship]{.underline}, [the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and China will continue engaging with each
other]{.underline}. Both sides understand that military-to-military
contacts are a critical component of bilateral engagement. Without such
interaction there is a risk that mistrust between the two militaries
could spill over and have a major negative impact on bilateral relations
in general. But strategic mistrust will probably persist in the absence
of greater transparency in military-to-military relations. In sum,
[Sino-American relations in the South China Sea are **more likely to be
characterised by cooperation and friction than a modus vivendi of
collaboration**]{.underline}

### Turn: drones in the SCS good

#### Drones sold to the SCS as a check to China

**Stone 6/03/19** (Stone, Mike. "U.S. to Sell 34 Surveillance Drones to
Allies in South China Sea\..." Reuters, Thomson Reuters, 3 June 2019,
www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-defense-drones/u-s-to-sell-34-surveillance-drones-to-allies-in-south-china-sea-region-idUSKCN1T42ST.)

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - [The [Trump]{.mark} administration has
[moved]{.mark} [ahead]{.mark} [with]{.mark} [a]{.mark} surveillance
[drone sale to four U.S. allies in the]{.mark} [S]{.mark}outh
[C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea region as acting Defense Secretary Patrick
Shanahan said [Washington]{.mark} [will no longer "tiptoe" around
Chinese behavior]{.mark} in Asia]{.underline}.

[The [drones would afford]{.mark} greater [intelligence gathering
capabilities]{.mark} potentially [curbing Chinese activity in the
region.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Shanahan did not directly name China when making accusations of "actors"
destabilizing the region in a speech at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue
in Singapore on Saturday but went on to say the United States would not
ignore Chinese behavior.

[The [Pentagon]{.mark} announced on Friday it [would sell 34]{.mark}
ScanEagle [drones]{.mark}, made by Boeing Co. [to]{.mark} the
governments of [Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam]{.mark}
for a total of \$47 million.]{.underline}

[[China claims]{.mark} almost all of the strategic [S]{.mark}outh
[C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea [and]{.mark} frequently [lambastes]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} its allies
over naval operations near Chinese-occupied islands. [Brunei, Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam]{.mark} have competing
claims.]{.underline}

[The Pentagon said Friday's sales included spare and repair parts,
support equipment, tools, training and technical services and work on
the equipment was expected to be completed by March 2022]{.underline}.

[As many as 12 unarmed drones and equipment would go]{.underline} to
Malaysia [for about \$19 million. Indonesia, the world's largest
Muslim-majority country would buy eight drones, the Philippines eight,
and Vietnam six.]{.underline}

In 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration rolled out a
long-awaited overhaul of U.S. arms export policy aimed at expanding
sales to allies, saying it would bolster the American defense industry
and create jobs at home.

That initiative eased rules for exporting some types of lethal as well
as non-lethal U.S.-made drones to potentially dozens more allies and
partners.

There is no armed version of the ScanEagle, but Insitu, the division of
Boeing that makes the drone, also makes the RQ-21A Blackjack which is an
optionally armed drone used by U.S. Navy and Marine Corps.

#### Vietnam and China are at a standoff for the SCS

**RFA 7/17/19** (Staff, Radio Free Asia. "South China Sea Standoff
Likely Signals China\'s \'Push of Maritime Claims\' Amid Vietnam
Backdown." Radio Free Asia, Radio Free Asia, 17 July 2019,
www.rfa.org/english/news/vietnam/standoff-07172019162945.html.)

[[An ongoing standoff between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} disputed waters of the [S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina
[S]{.mark}ea likely indicates that Beijing is "prepared to push its
maritime claims" after Hanoi cancelled oil exploration activities in the
area in recent years, according to experts.]{.underline} On July 15, the
Haiyang Dizhi 8, a ship operated by the China Geological Survey,
completed a 12-day survey of waters near the disputed Spratly Islands,
according to a recent report from Washington-based think tank the Center
for Advanced Defense Studies (C4ADS). [[Nine Vietnamese vessels followed
the China Coast Guard]{.mark} escorted Haiyang as it conducted its
survey of the area, according to C4ADS, [which included an oil block
that Vietnam had licensed]{.mark} to Spanish firm Repsol. The survey
followed an incident [on July 2]{.mark} in which [the China Coast Guard
ship]{.mark} Haijing 35111 sailed in what the Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS) described as [a "threatening manner"
towards Vietnamese vessels]{.mark} servicing the Japanese-owned
Hakuryu-5 oil rig, located in Vietnam's Block 06.1, some 370 kilometers
(230 miles) southeast of Vietnam.]{.underline} According to CSIS, the
Hajing maneuvered between the vessels at high speed, passing within 100
meters (330 feet) of each ship and less than half a nautical mile from
the rig. [[Both incidents took place in]{.mark} disputed waters of [the
S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea that fall within Vietnam's
exclusive economic zone, the two think tanks said. [China has
aggressively asserted its claims to]{.mark} the Spratlys and the rest of
[the South China Sea]{.mark}---which Vietnam refers to as the East
Sea---based on its so-called "nine-dash" demarcation line that
encompasses some 90 percent of the waters, [including territory claimed
by Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and
Singapore.]{.mark}]{.underline} If confirmed, [the incidents would
signal [the highest tension in the area since the 2014 China-Vietnam oil
rig crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}, when Chinese state-owned China National
Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) moved an oil platform to waters near
the disputed Paracel Islands and Vietnam attempted to prevent it from
establishing a fixed position. [[The standoff prompted]{.mark}
unprecedented [anti-China protests in Vietnam]{.mark}. While neither
side has confirmed the incidents of recent weeks, Vietnam's foreign
ministry on Tuesday issued a statement which said that "without
Vietnam's permission, all actions undertaken by foreign parties in
Vietnamese waters have no legal effect, and constitute encroachments in
Vietnamese waters, and violations of international law."]{.underline} At
a regular press conference on Wednesday, China's foreign ministry
spokesman Geng Shuang acknowledged that there had been an incident with
Vietnam, without providing details, and called on Hanoi to "earnestly
respect China's sovereignty, rights, and jurisdiction over the relevant
waters, and not take any actions that could complicate the situation."
The statements came after Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc
visited the headquarters of the Vietnam Coast Guard in Hanoi on July 11,
as the Haiyang was conducting its survey, and urged sailors to "stay
vigilant and ready to fight," according to an announcement on the Coast
Guard's website. On the same day, the chairwoman of Vietnam's National
Assembly, Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan, met with her Chinese counterpart, Li
Zhanshu, in Beijing, according to a report by China's Xinhua news
agency, which said the two officials agreed to "jointly safeguard peace
and stability at sea." Carlyle A. Thayer, Emeritus Professor at the
University of New South Wales, told RFA's Vietnamese Service that if it
is confirmed the Haiyang was conducting a survey off of the Spratlys
westernmost reef, known as Vanguard Bank, "this would be a very
sensitive area for Vietnam." The waters around Vanguard Bank fall within
Vietnam's 200-nautical-mile Exclusive Economic Zone, Thayer said, and
contain reserves estimated at around 45 million barrels of oil and 172
billion cubic feet of gas that are thought to be commercially viable for
up to 10 years after production begins. Vietnam controls the area
through three service support structures, each with a helipad mounted on
a steel base, he said, but the structures are "isolated" and "difficult
to protect." Hanoi cancelled oil exploration activities in the area in
2017 and 2018 after Beijing charged that it had violated agreements
reached by high-level leaders, and Thayer suggested that China is now
looking to exploit what Vietnam has left behind. "Now, in 2019, the
'shoe' is on China's foot," he said. "[[If developments in July are
confirmed, it would indicate that China is prepared to push its maritime
claims in the face of a Vietnamese backdown]{.underline}]{.mark}," he
said. Thayer also warned that if reports of a standoff between Chinese
and Vietnamese vessels are confirmed by the Vietnamese government and
media, "they will likely provoke widespread anti-China protests" in
Vietnam similar in scale to ones that rocked the country last year, when
the National Assembly considered a draft law on Economic Zones amid
rumors that Chinese interests would be granted 99-year leases. Gregory
B. Poling, a fellow with the Southeast Asia Program at CSIS, noted that
the area where the Haiyang was surveying is likely the same territory
where CNOOC announced nine oil and gas lots, and offered bids in 2012.
Beijing claims sovereignty over all of the Spratlys and says it has the
right to a 200-nautical-mile Exclusive Economic Zone surrounding them,
and while the lots are inefficient for extracting gas and oil, "China
does not care about \[resources\] there," Poling said. "If they can get
a foreign company to bid on one of the 2012 lots ... it will be a
diplomatic victory for China. They can say that foreign companies
acknowledge their claim to sovereignty."

#### Vietnam needs US drones for future SCS conflicts

**Thai NO DATE** (Thai, Tran Viet. "A Perspective on Vietnam."
Proliferated Drones, drones.cnas.org/reports/a-perspective-on-vietnam/.)

[It is also interesting to note that the [trend of using UAVs]{.mark}
[in maritime activities will]{.mark} surely [increase given the]{.mark}
complexity of [issues surrounding the S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina
[S]{.mark}ea. [This could]{.mark} in turn [have a strategic impact on
Vietnam's national security]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Recently, a U.S.
Defense Department report stated that [China is going to produce 41,800
military UAVs by 2023,]{.mark} many of which are intended [for striking
targets]{.mark}. This shocked many people in Hanoi, since with the land
reclamation projects in the South China Sea's Spratly Islands, China
could deploy large numbers of armed UAVs there and create a huge threat
to Vietnamese national security. This may push [Vietnam to develop
longer-range and armed UAVs more rapidly.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Currently, Vietnam can only use UAVs within its own territory, and no
UAV mission has been conducted outside its borders. There are three
reasons for this. First, all of Vietnam's UAVs are technically short-
and medium-range. Second, Vietnam has not yet signed any bilateral or
international agreement on the use of UAVs for military purposes,
especially for longer-range regional or global missions beyond its
borders. Third, Vietnam is pursuing a "three-no" defense policy: (i) Not
allowing any foreign country to create a military base in Vietnam; (ii)
Not sending Vietnamese combat troops abroad; and (iii) Not allowing any
party to use Vietnam's territory to attack a third party. The deployment
of military UAVs abroad is not appropriate at this moment, but all
options are open to future debate. There are extensive debates in
Vietnam about how to use UAVs for national defense purposes, and the
general sense is that UAVs can be legitimately used for protecting
independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. Vietnam so far has
no interests in sending UAVs abroad or using UAVs to strike targets
abroad. In legal, political, and technical terms, Vietnam is neither
willing nor ready to send UAVs to participate in crossborder operations,
into neighboring countries' territory, in longer-range regional or
global missions, or in expeditionary operations

[The United Kingdom has been using US Reaper drones since October
2007]{.underline}. [Since May 2008 the systems have been armed, equipped
with Hellfire missiles]{.underline} and, until 2012, 500lbs bombs. Even
before the UK acquired its own Reaper drones, UK pilots were controlling
American systems, as the RAF's 1115 Flight unit was embedded with the US
Air Force Reconnaissance Squadron in Nevada beginning in early 2004. RAF
pilots regularly flew missions for the US, including missile strike
sorties in Iraq and Afghanistan.\[1\]

Although [the UK received its own Reaper UAVs in 2007,]{.underline}
these systems, though controlled by RAF Pilots, were flown from a US Air
Force base and via the US military's satellite network. It took more
than five years to build a control structure in the UK; only after 2013
were some UK Reaper flights piloted from RAF Waddington, a base in
Lincolnshire, England. Meanwhile, the RAF's 39 Squadron, which controls
five of the UK's ten Reaper drones, remains in Nevada. It also appears
that the US is involved with Reaper operations in Waddington, but
information on this remains scarce. On the whole, UK's drone missions
depend largely if not completely on US infrastructure. This means that
the US is most likely able to monitor where and in what missions UK
Reapers are being flown.

### Drone prolif inevitable 

#### Drone Prolif inevitable, the brightlines set forth by the MTCR are arbitrary and countries just build drones that are just barely under the threshold and them sell them unencumbered

Moreover[, to claim technical compliance with MTCR guidelines, the armed
drones China exports (the CH-3, Wing-Loong, and CH-4B) tend to have
publicly announced payloads that fall just under 500 kg.]{.underline}
(Countries voluntarily declare whether their platforms pass the Category
I threshold, but there is no way to verify whether their statements
about payload size are accurate.) Similarly, later this year, the
Israeli firm IAI will
[deliver](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/india-all-set-to-get-missile-armed-drones-from-israel/articleshow/57980098.cms)
10 armed Heron TP drones to India as part of a contract signed in 2015.
IAI says that the exported variant of the Heron TP has a payload of [450
kg](http://www.defensenews.com/articles/iai-to-debut-mtcr-compliant-heron-tp), in
contrast to the more capable Israeli-operated variant, which is a
Category I system. Why does this matter? [There is nothing inherently
consequential about the difference between 450 kg and 500 kg when it
comes to the capabilities of a current-generation drone. In fact, what
enables a country to operate a drone effectively is not a 50 kg
difference in payload, but whether it has the organizational capacity to
integrate large amounts of intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance data in real time. Nevertheless, continued gaming of the
system undermines the MTCR as a whole by demonstrating that it cannot
succeed over time in significantly restricting the number of states with
militarily relevant drones.]{.underline}

[If drone proliferation is inevitable, the logic of using arbitrary and
overly restrictive MTCR guidelines to govern their export is
unpersuasive. Rather than making drone proliferation less likely, the
MTCR as presently constructed simply shifts who supplies armed drones,
and incentivizes countries to develop their own.]{.underline}

[Long-Range, High-Technology This group of UAVs includes
systems]{.underline} like the MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper, [which are
classified as Category I systems in the MTCR.]{.underline} [It also
includes systems like the RQ-7 Shadow, which are technically similar to
the Predator but classified as Category II in the MTCR.]{.underline}5
The technology required to make armed UAVs of these two categories is
not significantly different. They have proven themselves in combat
numerous times. Although the technology for keeping the Predator,
Reaper, and Shadow in the air is not particularly advanced, the mission
equipment that allows them to have an impact on ground combat is more
advanced and not widely available, including gyro-stabilized high-power
telescopes, laser designators, synthetic aperture radars, and precision
munitions. Some of these technologies are available in civilian
versions: Hollywood action films often use gyro-stabilized cameras
mounted on aircraft. But providing stability to a high-powered telescope
requires system performance higher than commercial applications. It is
also expensive.

announced that the U.S. State Department has approved the Foreign
Military Sale, and handed the certification to Congress for final
approval]{.underline}. Japan had earlier requested an initial batch of
eight Blk IB missiles in November 2018.

Worth an estimated \$1.15 billion, the SM-3 Block IB sale includes 56
interceptors, Mk 21 storage/launch canisters, and a range of technical
support and logistics services. While Raytheon is the prime contractor
for the all-up interceptor rounds, BAE Systems is the industry lead for
the canisters.

The SM-3 is the primary short/medium-range anti-ballistic missile (ABM)
system of the United States and is deployed aboard the U.S. Navy's Aegis
vessels. It has been adapted for land-based use under the Aegis Ashore
program. Japan is the only export operator of the system, having
equipped several vessels with the Aegis system and the RIM-161B Block IA
interceptor. Patriot PAC-3 systems provided a ground-based layer to
intercept missiles that "leaked" through the Aegis belt, while Japan
also operates earlier RIM-66 SM-2 surface-to-air missiles.

With an increased perceived threat, particularly that from North Korea,
Japan has become concerned that the current ABM assets could become
overwhelmed in a large-scale missile attack, and is looking to the Block
IB to add additional defensive capability. [The version employs a
two-color infrared seeker and an improved throttleable guidance system
to increase its kill probability]{.underline}. The SM-3 is a hit-to-kill
weapon that uses kinetic energy alone to destroy its target. The system
has been deployed by the U.S. Navy at sea since 2014, and by the Missile

More recently, however, fears of mass nuclear annihilation have led to
strict controls over the international exchange of the commodities and
technologies necessary for a renegade state to launch an attack. [To
coordinate these controls, the leading industrial states implemented the
multilateral Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). Often, the
technologies used to build sophisticated weaponry are \"dual-use\"
similar or even identical to the technologies required for civilian
space programs. The dual-use nature of these technologies has led
created tension between the right of states to use and explore outer
space and the need to control weapons proliferation. The MTCR,
particularly as applied by the United States, heavily favors
non-proliferation goals at the expense of newly emerging civilian space
programs]{.underline}

The danger to satellites and space stations from millions of pieces of

become a commercial opportunity and one of the best-funded companies in
the sector is based in Asia. ["Cleaning up space is critical," said Nobu

Estimates for the amount of space junk vary but the European Space

most are located in low earth orbit --- no further than 2,000km from the
ground. That number is set to increase as one of the hottest sectors of
the space industry --- the race by private companies such as SpaceX and
Amazon to develop lower cost rockets to deploy so-called nanosatellites
into orbit --- heats up. "Debris removal is a small but growing market,"

Space-Debris Removal an Inevitability", Volume 3, Issue 4

The box office hit Gravity, starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney,
provided the general public great insight into a very serious problem
that is developing in outer space---namely, the accumulation of
hazardous space debris in Earth orbit. The film portrays the devastating
effect of the rapidly moving space debris on spacecraft, made even more
horrifying when these spacecraft are occupied by astronauts. Some may
wonder if the movie exaggerated the severity of the space-debris
situation. In truth, **[the [space-debris]{.mark} situation in Earth
orbit [has passed the "tipping point]{.mark}]{.underline}**," thus
**[[requiring active]{.mark} debris [removal]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
order **[[to ensure]{.underline}]{.mark}** Earth **[[orbits remain
useable]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Space debris is defined as "manmade objects in space that are no longer
in use."\[1\] This debris has been accumulating since man first started
operating in space in the late 1950s. "These objects \[i.e., space
debris\] include non-operational spacecraft, derelict launch vehicle
stages, mission-related debris, and fragmentation debris."\[2\]
Mission-related debris, which is created during the launch/deployment
process, includes "items such as sensor and engine covers, straps,
springs, and yo-yo despin weights."\[3\] Fragmentation debris is
comprised of fragments from defunct rocket bodies and spacecraft which
are the product of explosions or collisions.\[4\] Fragmentation debris
comprises the majority of the space-debris population. "According to
NASA \[National Aeronautics and Space Administration\], 42 percent of
total extant debris is fragmentation debris (resulting primarily from
the break-up of satellites), 22 percent is non-functional spacecraft, 19
percent is mission related debris, and 17 percent is rocket
bodies."\[5\]

Space debris comes in varying sizes, ranging from diameters of less than
1 centimetre (cm) to full-size defunct spacecraft.\[6\] Space debris
less than 1 cm in diameter is usually mitigated using shielding and
orientation.\[7\] As a result of tremendous impact speeds, up to 15
kilometres per second (km/s) in low earth orbit (LEO), space debris 1 cm
in diameter can potentially damage or even destroy a satellite, and
debris 10 cm or larger will most likely have a catastrophic effect on
spacecraft.\[8\] Furthermore:

debris as small as 10 cm in diameter carries the kinetic energy of a
35,000-kg \[kilogram\] truck travelling at up to 190 km \[kilometres\]
per hour. While objects have lower velocities in Geostationary Earth
Orbit (GEO), debris at this altitude is still moving as fast as a
bullet---about 1,800 km per hour. No satellite can be reliably protected
against this kind of destructive force.\[9\]

Debris 10 cm in diameter or larger is currently tracked by space
surveillance; however, debris between 1 cm and 10 cm is not tracked and,
thus, represents an undetectable threat to spacecraft. There are
currently 21,000 pieces of tracked space debris 10 cm in diameter or
greater. Additionally, there are an estimated 600,000 pieces of debris
between 1 and 10 cm and 100,000,000 pieces between 0.1 cm and 1 cm in
Earth orbit.\[10\] This debris can persist from a few days to
indefinitely, depending on gravitational and non-gravitational factors
such as solar activity, altitude and corresponding atmospheric
drag.\[11\] At low altitudes, debris is eventually pulled into the
Earth's atmosphere where most of it is burned up upon re-entry. Debris
10 cm in diameter at an altitude of 200 km or less will only persist for
a matter of days, whereas the same debris at an altitude between 200 km
and 600 km can last for years. Debris can persist for hundreds of years
at altitudes above 600 km and indefinitely at altitudes above 36,000 km
(GEO).\[12\]

[In addition to debris persistence, there is the Kessler syndrome,
whereby space [debris collides with other]{.mark} space [debris]{.mark}
or objects]{.underline} (e.g., functional satellites), creating more
space debris, thus increasing the likelihood of further
collisions.\[13\] **[[This leads to a self-propagating]{.mark}
space-debris [situation]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The result of debris
persistence combined with the Kessler syndrome is that LEO has become
dangerously "polluted" with space debris.

[The growing space-debris population has increased the likelihood of
collisions with spacecraft.]{.underline} For example, the International
Space Station (ISS) has had to make avoidance manoeuvres, to avoid
catastrophic collisions with space debris, on average once per
year.\[14\] On one occasion, a crew of six was ordered to evacuate the
ISS and take refuge in two Russian Soyuz spacecraft until the threat
passed; the debris was detected too late to perform an avoidance
manoeuvre. "The two Americans, three Russians and one Japanese astronaut
spent a nerve-racking half an hour before mission control gave them the
all clear."\[15\] [Recent studies have indicated]{.underline} that [the
space-debris population in LEO has now reached a level whereby the
population of [debris]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[will continue to increase
even if no further debris is added]{.mark}.]{.underline}**\[16\]

This has led most space experts, including the Inter-agency Space Debris
Coordination Committee (IADC),\[17\] to determine that **[[the only
option is to intervene and prevent]{.mark} this [cascading]{.mark}
effect [by removing]{.mark} space [debris]{.mark} from
LEO.]{.underline}**\[18\] Within LEO, certain areas are particularly
polluted with space debris; studies have determined that the LEO regions
with the highest space-debris mass and collision probability are the
600-km, 800-km and 1000-km regions. These regions are mostly comprised
of large defunct spacecraft and rocket bodies with a high probability of
collision, which could further increase the debris population.\[19\]
These represent a logical target for active debris removal.\[20\] NASA
simulations estimate that the removal of two large objects (such as a
defunct spacecraft or rocket body) per year, starting in 2020, would
slow the debris population growth by 50 per cent. If five objects are
removed per year, the debris population can be maintained at, or
slightly above, current levels for the next 200 years.\[21\] Of course,
if the objective is to ameliorate the situation, more than five objects
per year would have to be removed. Given the uncertainty and possibility
of future collision events, it would be wise to err on the side of
caution and remove more than five objects per year.\[22\]

These particularly "polluted" regions of LEO are of great concern to the
Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF).
Many of Canada's military space-based capabilities are provided by LEO
satellites. For example, Canada's first dedicated military satellite,
Sapphire, resides in LEO. Sapphire provides space situational awareness
(SA) to the CAF and United States (US) military, as a contributing
sensor to the US's space surveillance network (SSN). Sapphire tracks
space debris and operational satellites in Earth orbit. This space SA
data supports the RCAF's North American Aerospace Defence Command
(NORAD) responsibility to provide aerospace warning for North
America.\[23\]

Canada's RADARSAT 2 satellite, which provides remote sensing
capabilities in support of the CAF, also resides in LEO. RADARSAT 2
provides, inter alia, Arctic and maritime ship detection as well as
environmental sensing in support of Canadian security operations. The
RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), the follow-on to RADARSAT 2, will
also reside in LEO. Due to launch in 2018, RCM will provide maritime
domain awareness, a ground-moving-target-indicator (GMTI) capability and
an automated identification system (AIS)\[24\] capability for ship
identification.

The CAF also uses commercial satellite imagery in support of military
operations via the Joint Space Support Team (JSST). The JSST provides SA
data to commanders through their Unclassified Remote Sensing Situational
Awareness (URSA) system. Commercial imagery satellites also reside in
LEO.\[25\]

Finally, Canadian search-and-rescue-satellite (SARSAT) payloads also
reside in LEO. SARSATs can detect emergency beacons at sea, in remote
forests and in the Arctic region. Canadian SARSAT capabilities have been
used in thousands of search and rescue operations since 1982 and have
been "instrumental in the rescue of over 24,000 lives worldwide."\[26\]
The loss of these military space capabilities as a result of an
over-polluted LEO region would be detrimental to the CAF as well as
Canadian safety and security.

[Now that the debris population has reached a critical level in
LEO]{.underline} (and most experts agree that active debris removal is
required), **[space-faring nations and the international community must
determine how to remove this debris from outer space]{.underline}**, who
will pay for it and how this will be regulated. **[[There are a number
of]{.mark} active debris [removal techniques]{.mark}]{.underline}**
under exploration, ranging from space-based robotics systems to
ground-based "contact-less" systems.\[27\] Space-based robotics systems
require a chaser or servicing vehicle that can be used to: 1) manoeuvre
orbitally; 2) rendezvous with space debris; 3) capture the space debris;
and 4) transfer the captured space debris to a graveyard orbit or to a
lower orbit for re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere.\[28\]

Such a chaser vehicle could be designed using conventional spacecraft
and propulsion technologies; however, some studies are examining
alternatives, such as using modified upper stages of launch vehicles as
chaser vehicles. The upper stages of launch vehicles are normally
discarded as debris during the launch process, therefore, comprising a
significant portion of large debris objects in Earth orbit. Modifying
the upper stages of launch vehicles to become a chaser vehicle has the
added benefit of preventing further debris build-up, while helping to
remove extant space debris. This would allow the removal of one large
piece of space debris after each launch and at a reduced cost when
compared to conventional vehicles.\[29\]

These modified upper stages of launch vehicles could be equipped with
electro-dynamic tether (EDT) propulsion systems rather than conventional
propulsion technologies. An EDT is a long conducting wire that is
attached to a spacecraft; the wire "can operate on electromagnetic
principles as generators, by converting their kinetic energy to
electrical energy, or as motors, converting electrical energy to kinetic
energy."\[30\] In other words, this is a propellant-less propulsion
system that uses the Lorentz force which results from the interaction
between the Earth's magnetic field and the conductive tether. "The main
advantage of the EDT for space debris removal is that it does not
require propellant. This reduces cost and improves reliability of
in-space propulsion and operations."\[31\]

In addition to determining an appropriate chaser vehicle and propulsion
system, **[there are various capturing-technique options.]{.underline}**
[These capturing techniques can be [categorized as pulling, pushing and
contact-less]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[32\] Pulling techniques use items
such as throw nets and harpoons. Pushing techniques utilize robotic arms
with clamping mechanisms. Contact-less techniques use technologies such
as ion beams, dust, lasers, foam or air bursts to exert a force on space
debris.

"One of the most promising techniques for actively controlling debris
during re-entry or re-orbiting is to attach a tether to it and pull
it."\[33\] Using a tether allows for capturing options that can handle
target space debris of any shape, attitude or spin rate. This removes
the very difficult requirement to dock with a rapidly moving/spinning
target. In 2012, the European Space Agency (ESA) studied the use of
throw nets to capture space debris.\[34\] "The idea is simple, a net
ejector mechanism ejects a net from a canister. The net is pulled open
by the inertia of a number of corner masses that have a high mass
relative to that of the net as well as a radial velocity."\[35\] The
masses at each corner of the net\[36\] would be ejected outward at an
angle (e.g., 30 degrees) to the centre of the net, thus forcing the net
to open. Their simulations demonstrated that the net would passively
wrap around the debris, fully securing the target. "However, while the
simulations show that a fully passive net closure is likely to be
sufficient, it is also possible to implement a simple closing mechanism
consisting of winches in two of the corner masses and a thread between
them."\[37\] Once the target debris is secured with the net, the chaser
vehicle would pull the debris to a graveyard orbit or back towards the
Earth for re-entry. ESA has determined that throw nets are "a very
promising capture mechanism that could work ... \[for\] a large range of
target sizes, shapes, attitudes and spin rates."\[38\]

Another tethered option is using a harpoon to capture space debris.
Harpoons have many of the same advantages as a throw net; however, there
are a few potential concerns. These concerns include the ability of the
harpoon to penetrate satellite material, the anchor strength once
penetration is achieved, and the potential creation of more debris
through fragmentation. Initial testing has demonstrated promising
results, and none of these initial concerns were identified as
"show-stoppers."\[39\]

One drawback of pulling techniques is that the thruster plume is
directed towards the tether and net, thus requiring the use of a
heat-resistant material, such as Zylon, on the portion of the tether
that is exposed to the thruster plume. "Thermal failure of the Zylon
tether is predicted \[upon re-entry\] at 74 km altitude."\[40\] Zylon is
tough enough to withstand the thruster plume but weak enough to burn up
upon re-entry into the atmosphere, therefore posing no risk to humans.

Pushing technologies include the use of robotic arms or tentacles with
some form of grappling device at the end to grab the space debris.\[41\]
Pushing techniques are inherently difficult during the rendezvous and
capture phases of the mission, since they require great precision,
especially when dealing with a rapidly moving, tumbling object.
Inaccurate sensors could lead to fragmentation of the debris or to a
collision between the chaser vehicle and the debris. Once the debris is
fully secured, the chaser vehicle and attached debris would propel
(i.e., push) forward up to a graveyard orbit or towards the Earth for
re-entry.

An issue that is common to both pushing and pulling techniques is the
risk of the explosion of debris energy stores.\[42\] Some nations, such
as France, have recently developed regulations to ensure the passivation
of all future spacecraft at end of life.\[43\] Passivation is the
depletion of all on-board sources of stored energy in a spacecraft.
Energy is stored in batteries, pressurized tanks and propellant tanks.
Unfortunately, extant space debris was not subject to regulations
requiring passivation; therefore, there is a risk of explosion when
attempting to capture this debris. Fortunately, "propellant tanks are
located inside the central cylinder and are therefore well protected
from e.g., \[sic\] clamping mechanisms."\[44\] Harpoons, on the other
hand, which penetrate into the body of the debris, must be carefully
targeted so as not to strike a tank. There is also the risk that a throw
net or grappling mechanism could break off a thruster, causing
propellant leakage. Fortunately, the propellant valve is located
upstream of the nozzle and flange, meaning that the valve would remain
uncompromised even if the thruster, nozzle and flange broke away. Since
the valve controls the flow of propellant, the propellant would remain
in the tanks. From a passivation perspective, the throw net represents
the lowest risk for an explosion.

A shared advantage of pulling and pushing techniques is the ability to
control the re-entry. This is particularly important when dealing with
large objects that are likely to survive re-entry into the Earth's
atmosphere, thus endangering human lives and property on the surface of
the Earth. Overall, studies involving pulling and pushing techniques
show promise.\[45\]

In addition to pulling and pushing techniques, there are numerous
contact-less techniques (ion beams, dust, lasers, foam or air bursts)
for space-debris removal, "even though the term is not entirely
accurate."\[46\] One study undertaken by the ESA and the Universidad
Politécnica de Madrid is the ion-beam shepherd (IBS) concept. The
concept involves directing the plasma from an ion-beam thruster towards
a piece of space debris, thus exerting a force.\[47\]

During a typical mission profile the IBS would rendezvous with the
target debris and, while co-orbiting at constant distance have one of
its ion beams constantly pointed at its surface to produce a small
continuous drag force while the other ion beam would point at the
opposite direction to keep the relative distance constant. This way the
IBS can be used to remotely manoeuvre space debris without physical
contact (docking), and can be repeated for multiple targets.\[48\]

It is highly advantageous that this technique can be used for multiple
targets. Studies show that this technique is a very promising option
with no show-stoppers. A similar concept using chemical thrusters
instead of ion-beam thrusters is also under consideration.

Another concept under investigation is the use of expanding foam.
Similar to the IBS concept, the chaser vehicle would have to rendezvous
in close proximity to the space debris prior to spraying it. The foam
would subsequently expand and remain stuck to the debris so as not to
create further debris. "The underlying principle of the method is to
increase the area-to-mass ratio of debris in sufficiently low earth
orbiting debris in order to increase their natural atmospheric drag and
thus substantially decrease their natural orbital lifetime leading to
their natural re-entry."\[49\] An alternative delivery method is to
embed the foam into future spacecraft as a preventative measure. Of
course, this foam technique would only work in lower altitude orbits
where there is sufficient atmospheric drag to allow for re-entry within
a reasonable amount of time. Studies indicate that a one-ton (907-kg)
piece of space debris could be de-orbited from a 900-km altitude within
25 years, demonstrating great promise.\[50\]

The use of air-burst vortex rings offers another possibility.\[51\] "The
concept uses an air burst mechanism to place air molecules in the path
of space debris, inducing a drag force which lowers orbital trajectory
until intersection with the atmosphere."\[52\] One possible
implementation would use a ground-based system to fire an air vortex
into space. "LEO debris encountering this air burst would undergo a drag
force from the increased ambient density, perturbing its orbit to the
point of intersection with the atmosphere. Drag forces would then
continue negative acceleration of the material until deorbit is
achieved."\[53\] This ground-based implementation would require a lot of
energy; however, it would be logistically simple.

Alternatively, a rocket could be used to carry an air-burst payload into
orbit. This would be logistically complex relative to the ground-based
option; however, it would reduce "energy costs associated with the
initial burst and propagation."\[54\] The use of air bursts is
considered very safe in terms of the risk of accidentally creating more
debris. Even if a failure occurred, "the systems themselves cannot
produce more debris as they never reach orbit."\[55\]

The United States Naval Research Laboratory is studying the use of dust
to remove space debris. A rocket would be used to carry a dust payload
into the path of the target debris.

The debris population is engulfed by the dust cloud, experiencing
enhanced drag and results in the loss of debris altitude. The debris
population descends to an altitude ... \[at\] which Earth's natural drag
is sufficient to force reentry within a desired time. The dust cloud
also descends under gravity and re-enters the atmosphere.\[56\]

Tungsten dust is a prime candidate due to its high density, abundance
and relatively low cost.

[[A ground-based laser also has potential]{.mark} as an active
debris-removal element. [Lasers could]{.mark} be used to [remove]{.mark}
both [large and small pieces]{.mark} of debris.]{.underline} "LODR
\[laser orbital debris removal\] uses the impulse generated by laser
ablation of the debris surface by a focused, pulsed ground-based laser
to change the debris orbit and cause it to re-enter the atmosphere. We
use a telescope to focus the laser down to a 30 cm diameter circle on a
target 1000 km away."\[57\] [The technique does not create more debris
because "only a few nanometres of surface are vaporized]{.underline} and
the object is not melted or fragmented by the gentle ablation
pulse."\[58\] **[The [lasers and telescopes required]{.mark} for such a
mission [now exist, making this]{.mark} a [feasible]{.mark}
option.]{.underline}**

[Space [debris]{.mark} in Earth orbit [is a problem
necessitating]{.mark} intervention in the form of [active debris
removal]{.mark}. [Potential]{.mark} active debris [removal
techniques]{.mark}---including pulling, pushing and contact-less---[are
being explored]{.mark}.]{.underline} While further analysis is required,
**[initial [studies]{.mark} at various institutions [around the globe
indicate very promising results]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The technical
feasibility of active debris removal, however, is only part of the
challenge that lies ahead. Perhaps of equal or greater difficulty are
the regulatory, economic, political and legal challenges related to
active debris removal. These areas require further examination as part
of a broader effort to understand global space-governance requirements.

Although space debris is a growing concern and will have to be addressed

single contributors to the lifecycle risk of a satellite, but manageable
in that the risk is still sufficiently low that **[[it doesn\'t require

SPACE.com.  Pulliam noted that [[a recent study by The Aerospace

[for]{.underline} typical low-Earth orbit [satellite constellations, the

[cost](http://www.space.com/11657-space-junk-orbital-debris-cleanup-darpa.html##)
of the constellation]{.mark}]{.underline}, depending on the type of

be any problem at all or a collision will take out a satellite requiring
a spare to be built and launched,\" Pulliam said. Still, a new
significant debris event could statistically happen tomorrow which would
greatly accelerate the growing risk and require a more immediate
response, he cautioned.

#### Can\'t solve debris - International law

**Listner 11**

Michael J. Listner, Policy Analyst, "The Legal and Political Issues of
Space Debris Removal" OnOrbitWatch, December 1, 2011,
<http://www.onorbitwatch.com/feature/legal-and-political-issues-space-debris-removal>

Space debris is a prominent topic in the world of outer space security
and sustainability. After 57 years of launching space objects into orbit
starting with Sputnik-1, the proliferation of derelict satellites,
fragments from collisions and explosions and other remnants of man\'s
activity in space have created a serious concern that needs to be
addressed in the short term. The methods to address space debris include
mitigation to prevent further contamination and removal of debris
currently threatening space activities in Earth orbit. Legal and
[[political considerations underlie]{.mark} the issue of orbital [space
debris, and in some cases]{.mark} those issues [are]{.mark} equally if
not [more onerous than]{.mark} the [technical
challenges]{.mark}]{.underline} surrounding its removal. The most
prominent issue surrounding cleanup of orbital space debris rests with
the fact that [[under international space law, space objects such as
nonfunctioning satellites still belong to the
country]{.underline}]{.mark} or countries that launched them. Even
though a satellite may not be functioning, this does not mean that it
has been abandoned, and without consent from the owner, [[it cannot
be]{.mark} disposed of or otherwise [interfered
with]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is further complicated by
[the]{.underline} fact that international space [[law deems
fragments]{.underline}]{.mark} and components from space objects [[as
individual space objects]{.mark} in and of themselves]{.underline},
which would require identification to determine the owner and either
individual or blanket consent to remove it from orbit.Ancillary to
ownership are issues dealing with licensing and compliance with
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). Methodologies to
de-orbit intact derelict satellites may include the use of mechanisms
that will rendezvous, attach and physically move the derelict from a
stable orbit to either a graveyard orbit where it will not interfere
with other space objects or into a less stable orbit that would ensure
the destruction of the derelict within a short period of time. This
methodology of space debris [removal requires an intimate
knowledge]{.underline} of the spacecraft [so that an effort to de-orbit
it would not result in fragmentation and the creation of additional
space debris.]{.underline}

### Hyper Sonic Missiles 

#### Not even "the father of the MTCR" thinks that it is capable of resolving the threat of Hypersonic Missiles

(**Speier 18**, Richard, Adjunct Staff with the RAND Corp. He received a
Bachelor of Arts degree in Physics from Harvard College and a Ph.D. in
Political Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
During 4 years of graduate study he focused on economic and strategic
analysis, including work at the RAND Corporation and the Institute for
Defense Analysis.

He then entered the Office of Management and Budget, where he helped
reshape nuclear and space programs, and later the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, where he analyzed nuclear technologies that
contribute to proliferation.  He spent a year at the National War
College co-authoring a prize-winning study, \"The Bomb in Southwest
Asia\".

In 1982 he joined the Office of the Secretary of Defense to start the
Office of Non- Proliferation Policy. For 10 years he helped design,
negotiate, and implement the Missile Technology Control Regime. In
recognition of his work on the international negotiations that led to
the MTCR, the Secretary of Defense awarded him the Meritorious Civilian
Service Medal. **Speier is widely credited with being \"the father of
the MTCR**.\"  He later helped initiate the Defense Department's Office
of Counter-Proliferation Policy., Hypersonic Missiles: A New
Proliferation Challenge, Rand Cooperation,
https://www.rand.org/blog/2018/03/hypersonic-missiles-a-new-proliferation-challenge.html)

At the international level, a broad agreement to limit trade in
lower-level hypersonic technologies should exist so that this trade is
undertaken only with the greatest circumspection. [The Missile
Technology Control Regime (MTCR), a 35-state international policy aimed
at restricting missile proliferation, currently covers some hypersonic
technologies]{.underline}. For example, Japan and Europe have expressed
a desire to develop hypersonic airliners. Due to challenges associated
with past efforts to develop cost-effective, hypersonic airliners, as
exemplified by the fate of the Concorde airliner, the RAND Corporation
[report](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2137.html)
expresses skepticism regarding the feasibility of this goal.
Nevertheless, for situations involving hypersonic aircraft to be used as
airliners or for launching space satellites, the MTCR provides a
case-by-case review process to try to prevent technologies from
proliferating to state weapons programs.

[However, there are some loopholes in the policy\'s coverage of
hypersonic missiles. For instance, China is not a member of the MTCR.
Additionally, because hypersonic missiles require little or no payload
(such as explosives) to constitute a threat, they do not conform to the
payload requirements in the regime\'s definition of a missile that is
subject to its tightest restrictions.]{.underline} [Therefore, if a
minimal,]{.underline} three-state [embargo]{.underline}---one that
includes China and imposes stiffer restrictions than the MTCR---[is to
be rapidly established, such a policy must be formulated outside of the
existing regime.]{.underline}

[Hypersonic gliders can be best intercepted during their launch from the

terminal phase. [The F-35 Lightning II aircraft has a sensor system

a report from the U.S. Air Force and Missile Defense Agency on
incorporating ballistic missile defense capability to F-35 to shoot down
missiles in boost phase[. As the hypersonic glider is launched from a
traditional ICBM till the boost-phase, the F-35 can be one of the
options to defend against the Avangard glider]{.underline}

Amid the return to great power conflict[, it is understandable that the
United States fears the rapidly increasing capabilities of its rising
peer competitors]{.underline}. [But it is worthwhile to
consider]{.underline} whether the U.S. investment in
[hypersonics]{.underline} needs to be rebalanced more toward developing
[defensive](https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2019/03/21/is-the-pentagon-moving-quickly-enough-on-hypersonic-defense/)
capabilities. [It is also helpful to consider those fears in historical
perspective and in light of constant shifts in the technological and
military balance.]{.underline} The United States needs offensive and
defensive hypersonic capabilities for deterrence. Yet [ironically, China
and Russia's acquisition of these capabilities can help to stabilize
tensions because it helps them fear the United States less, and vice
versa. So keep calm and innovate on.]{.underline}

#### Arms sales are up -- boosts the DIB

weapons to previously restricted buyers," *Business Insider*, 1/8/18,

//Haus

[The Trump administration is nearing completion of a]{.underline} new
\"Buy American\" [plan that calls]{.underline} for U.S. military
attaches and diplomats to help drum up billions of dollars more in
business overseas for the American weapons industry, [going beyond the
assistance they currently provide]{.underline}, U.S. officials said.

President Donald [Trump]{.underline} as early as February [is
expected]{.underline} to announce a \"whole of government\" effort [to
ease export rules on purchases by foreign countries of U.S.-made
military equipment]{.underline}, from fighter jets and drones to
warships and artillery, according to people familiar with the plan.

Trump is seeking to fulfill a 2016 election campaign promise to create
jobs in the United States by selling more goods and services abroad to
bring down the U.S. trade deficit from a six-year high of \$50 billion.

The administration is also under pressure from U.S. defense contractors
facing growing competition from foreign rivals such as China and Russia.
But any loosening of the restrictions on weapons sales would be in
defiance of human rights and arms control advocates who said there was
too great a risk of fueling violence in regions such as the Middle East
and South Asia or arms being diverted to be used in terrorist attacks.

Besides greater use of a network of military and commercial attaches
already stationed at U.S. embassies in foreign capitals, senior
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said [another thrust of
the plan will be to set in motion a realignment of]{.underline} the
International Trafficking in Arms Regulations (ITAR). It is a central
policy [governing arms exports]{.underline} since 1976 and has not been
fully revamped in more than three decades.

This expanded government effort on behalf of American arms makers,
together with looser restrictions on weapons exports and more favorable
treatment of sales to non-NATO allies and partners, could bring
additional billions of dollars in deals and more jobs, a senior U.S.
official said, without providing specifics.

The strategy of [having the Pentagon]{.underline} and the U.S. State
Department [take a more active role in securing foreign arms deals
could]{.underline} especially [benefit]{.underline} major [defense
contractors]{.underline} such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing Co.

\"We want to see those guys, the commercial and military attaches,
unfettered to be salesmen for this stuff, to be promoters,\" said the
senior administration official, who is close to the internal
deliberations and spoke on condition of anonymity.

A State Department official, asked to confirm details of the coming new
policy, said [the]{.underline} revamped [approach]{.underline} \"gives
our partners a greater capacity to help share the burden of
international security, [benefits the defense industrial
base]{.underline} and will provide more good jobs for American
workers.\"

The White House and Pentagon declined official comment.

Defense industry officials and lobbyists have privately welcomed what
they expect will be a more sales-friendly approach.

It is unclear how deeply the diplomats and military officers overseas
will delve into dealmaking and what guidelines will be established, said
officials in the administration.

[Trump]{.underline}, a Republican, [has the]{.underline} legal
[authority to direct]{.underline} government embassy \"security
[assistance officers]{.underline},\" both military personnel and
civilians, to do more [to]{.underline} help [drive arms
sales.]{.underline}

Administration officials see this group, which already has duties such
as managing military aid overseas and providing information to foreign
governments for buying U.S. arms, as underutilized by previous
presidents.

One national security analyst said that easing export restrictions to
allow defense contractors to reap greater profits internationally would
increase the danger of top-of-the-line U.S. weapons going to governments
with poor human rights records or being used by militants.

\"This administration has demonstrated from the very beginning that
human rights have taken a back seat to economic concerns,\" said Rachel
Stohl, director of the conventional defense program at the Stimson
Center in Washington. \"And the short-sightedness of a new arms export
policy could have serious long-term implications.\"

The administration officials said human rights considerations would
remain part of the formula for arms sales decisions. But they said such
reviews would now afford greater weight than before to whether a deal
would be good for the U.S. economy and strengthen America\'s defense
industrial base, in which case red tape would be cut accordingly.

Rules to make it easier to sell U.S.-made military drones overseas and
compete against fast-growing Chinese and Israeli rivals are also
expected to be in the Trump plan, officials said.

Trump\'s Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, also sought to make it
easier to sell to America\'s most trusted allies but in a more cautious
approach that his administration billed as a way to boost American
business while keeping strict controls against more dangerous arms
proliferation. Foreign weapons sales soared during his tenure, with the
United States retaining its position as the world\'s top arms supplier.

Shares of the five biggest U.S. defense contractors, including Lockheed,
Boeing, Raytheon Co, General Dynamics Corp and Northrop Grumman have
more than tripled over the last five years and currently trade at or
near all-time highs.

[Foreign military sales]{.underline} in fiscal 2017, comprising much of
Trump\'s first year in office and the final months of Obama\'s term,
[climbed to \$42 billion, compared to \$31 billion]{.underline} in the
prior year, according to the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency.

The [Trump]{.underline} administration [has]{.underline} already [moved
forward on]{.underline} several controversial [sales]{.underline}. Those
include a push for \$7 billion in precision-guided munitions to Saudi
Arabia despite concerns they have contributed to civilian deaths in the
Saudi campaign in Yemen\'s civil war and the unblocking of \$3 billion
in arms to Bahrain, which was also held up by human rights concerns
under Obama.

Similar concerns have been raised over the administration\'s
preparations to make it easier for American gun makers to sell small
arms, including assault rifles and ammunition, to foreign buyers.

A draft of the new policy proposals recently finished by inter-agency
teams coordinated by Trump\'s National Security Council must now be
approved by a select group of senior cabinet members before being sent
to his desk, the government sources said.

Once Trump announces an extensive framework of the plan, there will be a
60-day public comment period. After that, [the administration is
expected to unveil further details]{.underline}. Some of the changes are
expected to take the form of what is formally known as a presidential
\"National Security Decision Directive,\" two of the sources said.

#### Export controls on drones cause long term DIB losses

**Debul 18** (Daniel Cebul, editorial fellow and general assignments
writer for Defense News, "Strict export regulations may be costing US
industry billions in foreign sales," *Defense News*, June 18, 2018,
https://www.defensenews.com/newsletters/unmanned-systems/2018/06/18/strict-export-regulations-may-be-costing-us-industry-billions-in-foreign-sales/)///JP

WASHINGTON ― A new RAND report assessing the proliferation of unmanned
aerial vehicles suggests existing [export controls for drones may hurt
the U.S. more than it helps.]{.underline}

[Limiting U.S. drone exports has left a hole in the global market for
the technology, especially in historically U.S.-dominated Middle East
markets, which has been readily filled by U.S. competitors ---
specifically China and Russia.]{.underline} The Trump administration
recently unveiled a new set of export policies regarding military
technology in an attempt to facilitate the transfer of military
technology, but the changes do not change the status of drones under the
Missile Technology Control Regime, or MTCR.

How does the MTCR work?

The MTCR is a voluntary export control consortium of 35 nations designed
to prevent signatories from proliferating longer-range cruise and
ballistic missile technology. The arms control regime was extended to
UAVs because early iterations of drones were considered a subset of
cruise missile technology due to their active guidance system.

The regime divides missiles into two categories. Category I items are
capable of delivering a 500 kg payload more than 300 km. The sale of
category I systems is restricted by a "strong presumption of denial,"
meaning they are only exported in rare circumstances. The MQ-9 Reaper,
RQ-4 Global Hawk and MQ-4 Triton are well-known unmanned systems that
fall under this category.

[Over the past several years, U.S. partners such as Jordan, Saudi Arabia
and UAE were denied requests to purchase American drones, **and have
since turned to China** to purchase comparable systems.]{.underline}

Trump administration officials have been attempting to alter the regime
by adding new language that would drop any vehicle that flies under 650
kilometers per hour to category II systems. This would make all but the
most advanced U.S. systems available for international sale. For
example, the MQ-9 Reaper clocks in with a cruise speed of 230 mph or 370
kph, according to an Air Force facts sheet.

Drone proliferation

RAND found that [10 nations operate category I drones, and more than 15
operate near-category I systems that register just below the MTCR's
payload and distance restrictions]{.underline}. The report says
increased proliferation rates are due to a handful of countries,
specifically China, Israel and the United Arab Emirates, who are not
party to the MCTR.

[More countries are expected to procure drones, which pose a "growing
threat to U.S. and allied military operations,"]{.underline} the report
says. While category I systems can deploy missiles and other guided
munitions, their main threat lies in "their ability to conduct
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) operations against
U.S. forces prior to hostilities," according to RAND. "Adversaries that
would otherwise have difficulty detecting U.S. force deployments,
monitoring U.S. operations, and maintaining targeting data on U.S. units
can employ UAVs to maintain situational awareness of U.S. capabilities"

The report identifies Russia, China and Iran as unfriendly nations that
will seek to utilize drones to complicate U.S. military operations.

For example, China and Saudi Arabia recently agreed to set up a UAV
manufacturing plant in Saudi Arabia for up to 300 new UAVs, and Italy
will receive 20 Hammerhead UAVs from the UAE. The coproduction of
regional drone factories "could further exacerbate the proliferation of
large UAVs to the degree that these systems are exported to other
nations," according to RAND, and that hurts U.S. industry.

A U.S.-sized hole

[Voluntarily restricting U.S. drone exports have allowed competitors to
establish themselves in a market Rand expects to "grow from about \$6
billion in 2015 to about \$12 billion in 2025."]{.underline}

[RAND expect export controls to have a **negative impact on the U.S.
industrial base,** something those in industry already
know.]{.underline}

"[What you are enabling the competition to do is not just to sell some
hardware]{.underline}," Linden Blue, General Atomic's chief executive,
told reporters during an Aug. 16, 2017 roundtable at the company's
headquarters in Poway, California. "[You're enabling it to build a
customer base for at least 20 years, I would say. You're enabling them
to build a logistics system. It will take them many years to get to
where we are right now, but you're helping them start out. They should
be very thankful."]{.underline}

//Haus

[US defense]{.underline} strategy [requires]{.underline} an
[improvement]{.underline} in its security assistance program to
adequately empower allies [and partners to]{.underline} provide for
their own security and to [support the US defense-industrial
base]{.underline}. A struggling global economy and shrinking defense
budgets, however, may hamper such efforts. Allies and partners struggle
in their attempt at spending adequate amounts on defense, and US budget
reductions may reduce America's defense spending, thus curtailing
foreign military aid and revenues available to US defense contractors.
[Without adequate levels of revenue, the already brittle defense-
industrial base may be incapable of developing technologies and offering
the American military the best capabilities in the future.]{.underline}

Ultimately, major reductions in defense spending will lead suppliers, as
well as research and development projects, to fall by the wayside. An
"American Way of War" that has utilized technology to offset
quantitative advantages of our opponents may not be sustainable.2
Accordingly, [with a limited defense budget, the United States needs to
find new ways to simultaneously provide for national security, while
maintaining its industrial base.]{.underline} Improved security
assistance will be a key pillar of this effort. Without significant
reforms that increase US responsiveness and competitiveness in the
global defense market, efforts to innovate will be impacted.
Fortunately, [the United States can improve the existing security
assistance apparatus by reforming export controls]{.underline}, updating
legislation, expanding financing programs, and developing a dedicated
security assistance workforce.

The Value of Security Assistance

Security assistance is a form of security cooperation that contains
programs through which the United States provides defense articles and
services to international organizations and foreign governments in
support of US policies and objectives. Although usually administered by
the Department of Defense (DOD), specifically the Defense Security
Cooperation Agency (DSCA), these programs are legally under the control
of the Department of State. Major security assistance categories include
Foreign Military Sales (FMS), Direct Commercial Sales (DCS), and
International Military Education and Training. Through the FMS process,
the US government procures defense articles, services, and training on
behalf of the foreign customer country, under the auspices of the DSCA.
Sizable sales also occur through the DCS process between a foreign
country and a US contractor.

The strategic rationale for increased security [assistance]{.underline}
is two-fold: it empowers regional partners and allies, and it [sustains
the defense-industrial base through increased US exports]{.underline}.
US efforts during the Second World War and the US security architecture
throughout the Cold War utilized security assistance funding to bolster
the defenses of regional allies against the spread of fascism and
communism. Although the Cold War has ended, [US support of strategic
"strong points" continues as an economical means to check power
imbalances among countries and counter state instability.]{.underline}

Although security assistance consists of much more than arms sales, [the
transfer of major weapons systems does permit the United States to
access and influence various nations.]{.underline} For example, [a
nation will]{.underline} not simply buy a squadron of F-16 fighters. It
will [send its pilots to the United States for training, bring in US
contractors to conduct maintenance and logistics activities, and engage
in a strategic dialogue with the United States on the employment of
assets]{.underline}. Common technology and materiel builds similar
Concepts of Operations (CONOPS), [promoting interoperability with
nations that may later become coalition partners]{.underline}. Thus
[arms]{.underline} contracts are not only an end to themselves but also
[serve as a means to develop a relationship with a particular
nation]{.underline}. Indeed, foreign [countries]{.underline} often
relish the chance to [procure American technology and equipment
beyond]{.underline} the [obvious material benefits, leveraging the
experience and geopolitical strength of the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is a potential asset for their own national
security.]{.underline}

Additionally[, security assistance activities build relationships
between the United States and partner militaries in a way other
activities often do not.]{.underline} As last year's events in Egypt
demonstrated, the professional relationship between militaries can open
avenues of communication necessary for the United States to fully
comprehend a situation, exercise its foreign policy, and promote peace
and stability in what otherwise may be a chaotic situation.

The persistence of counterterror and counterinsurgency campaigns over
the past decade reinforces the value of access to theaters that security
assistance enables.

These campaigns also highlight the extended duration of these types of
conflicts and the associated political and financial costs. In the
future, [America will need to maximize the ability of]{.underline}
national [governments to handle crises]{.underline} and conflicts
[without direct US involvement. Building a partner's capacity to
undertake operations]{.underline} is a cost-effective matter that
[addresses their own security challenges while reducing the prospect of
US military action]{.underline}, and heightens the likelihood of saving
blood and treasure for all concerned. This approach has succeeded in the
Philippines, Saudi Arabia, and a host of other countries.

[The challenging fiscal environment]{.underline} the United States is
facing [will accentuate these trends]{.underline}, pushing the United
States to encourage other states to spend more on defense. The fiscal
challenges of allies and partner states will, however, also
simultaneously reduce available defense revenues. For example, NATO
Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen worryingly pointed out in 2011
how "over the past two years defense spending by NATO's European member
nations has shrunk by some 45 billion dollars---that is the equivalent
of Germany's entire annual defense budget."3 The United States' fiscal
situation will likely reduce the level of US funding available to other
nations. Proposals to simply increase the amount spent on security
assistance will not resonate well either within the Pentagon or on
Capitol Hill. Consequently, the existing US security assistance
apparatus will need to become more capable and efficient.

[Another motivating factor for improving security assistance is the
continued success of the US defense-industrial base. Without a strong
industrial base, bolstered by]{.underline} international [transfers,
prices of US acquisitions could increase]{.underline} at a time [when
other nation's]{.underline} defense [budgets are falling. Decreased US
defense spending will aggravate market deviations already prevalent in
the]{.underline} relatively closed and single-buyer, or monopolistic,
[arms industry]{.underline}. Throughout various defense sectors,
[few]{.underline} major prime [contractors are capable of producing key
products, hampering competition]{.underline}. [The situation
is]{.underline} even more [perilous among]{.underline} subcomponent
[manufacturers]{.underline}. For example, in the precision guided
munitions sector, Eagle Picher produces almost all thermal battery
units; Honeywell produces Inertial Measurement Units (IMU); and Rockwell
Collins produces Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers. All three
are primarily the sole-source suppliers of Raytheon, Lockheed Martin,
and Boeing.4 Another example can be seen in the world of mine warfare
where the Navy's Mk71 Naval Quickstrike Mines program has faltered as
the only company manufacturing a component of the Target Detection
Device went out of business. [Further]{.underline} defense
[cuts]{.underline}, absent compensating offsets, [could significantly
affect the industry]{.underline}. [Critics might argue defense
cuts]{.underline} will [stabilize the market]{.underline} and rectify
market errors. In doing so, however, [they assume the]{.underline}
defense [industry is a]{.underline} truly [competitive market, which
is]{.underline} certainly [not the case.]{.underline} Rather, [a key
element of sustaining the defense-industrial base will be export sales
as a means for sustaining production]{.underline} lines [and generating
revenues]{.underline} (profits) [necessary for long-term research and
development.]{.underline}

Recognizing these trends, a number of national defense companies around
the globe, particularly in Europe, such as BAE Systems and Fincantierri,
have shifted the majority of their operations abroad, including to the
United States, establishing parallel "home markets." With a number of
major actors in the defense market generally spending less on defense,
international competition will be fierce.

US defense companies have made adjustments. For example, in Boeing's
defense unit foreign sales currently make up 18 percent of its sales,
compared with 7 percent six years ago, and the company has a goal of
boosting this market share to 25 percent within the next five years.5
According to the DSCA, despite fierce competition, US companies are
expected to have sold a record \$46.1 billion in military hardware to
foreign governments in 2011.6 By value, the United States already is the
largest arms exporter in the world, and defense goods and services are
one of the strongest US exports.

Additional [exports will be needed to pick up]{.underline} any [slack
generated by US defense reductions]{.underline}. Also, more exports are
required in an effort to sustain the US strategic advantage in such
areas as aerospace systems. To sustain this US advantage, internal
government and industry procedures require comprehensive reform.

Limits of the Security Assistance Apparatus

The aforementioned demands on security assistance capabilities often
encounter a system that is inadequate to support the task. The current
process is primarily founded on a collection of programs authorized by
the US Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Arms Export Control Act of
1976. In the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review, Secretary Gates said the
existing system is "constrained by a complex patchwork of authorities,
persistent shortfalls in resources, unwieldy processes, and a limited
ability to sustain such undertakings beyond a short period." In the 2011
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Guidance, Admiral Mullen stated
the current process is outdated, cumbersome, top-heavy, and adversely
affects US military posture.7

Not every aspect of the security assistance system needs reform, but
certain outdated elements and sclerotic bureaucratic processes have left
the United States lagging behind other nations. Secretary of Defense
Gates wrote that other countries have been "more quickly funding
projects, selling weapons, and building relationships."8

Over the last decade, the United States attempted to improve its
security assistance capabilities in response to overseas contingency
operations. Section 1206 of the National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2006, as amended and regularly extended, provides
the Secretary of Defense, through requests by Combatant Commanders, with
authority to train and equip foreign military forces for two specified
purposes: counterterrorism and stability operations, and foreign
maritime security forces for counterterrorism operations. Funds need to
receive the concurrence of the Secretary of State. For fiscal year 2010,
the United States dedicated \$340.6 million to support bilateral
programs in 18 countries and one multilateral program for seven
recipients (including three receiving bilateral aid).9 Congress, thus
far, has refrained from codifying

Section 1206 in permanent law, as requested by DOD. More importantly,
though, the successes in counterterrorism and stability operations aid
dispensation through Section 1206 funding have not translated into
improvements in US Foreign Military Sales or Direct Commercial Sales
effectiveness or efficiency, especially with regard to major systems
which could boost the sales. For these reasons, further security
assistance reforms are required.

The Global Perspective

The United States is not the only global provider of defense materiel
and services. Numerous other nations have sophisticated arms industries
that compete with the United States. Some, such as Sweden, have
specialized industries in aerospace or small arms, while others, such as
Russia, compete across a wide spectrum of capabilities. The majority of
these competitors are not military opponents of the United States. Of
the 15 largest arms exporters in the world, nine are allies (Canada,
France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Korea, Netherlands, Spain, and the
United Kingdom) and a further two are close US partners (Sweden and
Switzerland).10 In the future, the United States should pursue
defense-industrial collaboration among allied countries through
mechanisms such as co-development to achieve necessary economies of
scale in research and production. In spite of any future collaboration,
international competition between the United States and its allies will
continue and, in all likelihood, intensify.

Overshadowing this competitive arena is the global economic downturn.
With a few key exceptions among major actors such as China, India, and
Brazil, defense budgets are shrinking. Concomitantly, international
defense-industrial competition remains at an all-time high. The demand
for defense products is generally decreasing while capacity remains
constant. In the current decade, [the United States will need to
compete]{.underline} more intensely for each arms contract [if we are to
enjoy the]{.underline} national security [benefits]{.underline} security
assistance provides.

Defense procurement decisions are not just about capabilities or even
geopolitics; they are also, at their core, business and fiscal
decisions. Restrictions placed on the use of US hardware and total cost
competition can at times reduce the US sales advantage. This is
particularly true in the case of large acquisition projects, such as
aircraft; most countries are unable, or unwilling, to pay exor- bitant
prices upfront. As with any other business venture, sellers offer
financing programs to fund these large-scale projects. The US financing
system, once robust during the Cold War era when there was a strong
political incentive to ensure nations had equipment to ght communism,
atrophied in the 1990s when there was no longer a pressing need to
deliver materiel and technology to counter strategic threats. Now that
the global economy is struggling, access to financing is crucial in
nations faced with fiscal concerns. In certain cases, the initiative
taken by various countries to provide competitive financing makes their
offerings more palatable to national parliaments. This is often the case
even when the militaries want to build a relationship with the United
States. [If the United States does not have the means to make
competitive offers, then it stands at a disadvantage versus
competitors.]{.underline}

the York, Pa., facility where BAE Systems manufactures the Bradley
Fighting Vehicle and the suppliers that support the program. Built to
protect and transport troops, the armored vehicle is the workhorse of
the U.S. Army and the embodiment of American defense industrial base
know-how and engineering: The vehicle's advanced aluminum armor and
weapons systems are produced by 7,000 skilled workers in 586 businesses
across 44 states.

Now, in an attempt to modernize the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, the Army
is shifting funding away from Bradley Industrial Base, which in turn
will force a closure of the base's production and supply chain as early
as 2014 and lasting at least three years. With production halted, the
businesses that make up the Bradley Industrial Base will be unable to
employ the highly skilled workers who produce the specialized parts that
keep these vehicles running. [Thousands of workers will **lose their
jobs** and some will move on to other fields, while their **skills** ---
unique to building combat vehicles --- will become **lost or obsolete**.
As a result, our armed forces may end up going into harm's way **without
equipment manufactured** in America and ready for today's
battlefield.]{.underline}

[Since World War II, our military --- and all Americans --- have relied
on a **highly skilled, dedicated and engaged civilian defense labor
force of engineers, designers, welders, electricians, machinists and
pipe fitters**]{.underline}. Like a well-prepared combat team, [this
labor force --- nearly 625,000 people --- is continuously training in
order to maintain their **technological superiority**. As new
technologies are developed to address the **ever-changing threats** from
our enemy, this labor force acquires new skills to **keep pace and meet
the military's needs**]{.underline}. Now [these workers, the products
they make, the incomes their families and communities depend on and
America's ability to defend itself are all **at risk.**]{.underline}

As a nation, we must make it a priority to ensure the strength of the
Army's combat vehicle program and the skilled defense industrial base
jobs that support this crucial capability. The Army can help the Bradley
Industrial Base in the near term simply by spending the \$288 million
provided last year to allow industry to perform its requirements, which
ensure that older vehicles are upgraded with the latest technology our
troops need. In the longer term, [the Army should work with industry to
ensure that our troops can meet the missions they might face, while
providing industry with the stability to sustain the skilled jobs needed
to respond to future threats.]{.underline}

[Dwindling budgets]{.underline} and the desire for short-term financial
gains [are threatening America's "arsenal of democracy" and with it our
economy]{.underline}. The skilled men and women of the defense
manufacturing industry do work that allows us to fly the red, white and
blue, and they must not be pink-slipped. [Equipping our military is too
important to outsource --- our economy, our national security and our
fellow Americans count on it.]{.underline}

#### American growth and leadership solve war -- the alternative is power vacuum conflicts 

**Haass 13** Richard N. Haass, President of the Council on Foreign
Relations, previously served as Director of Policy Planning for the US
State Department The World Without America
https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/repairing-the-roots-of-american-power-by-richard-n\--haass

NEW YORK -- Let me posit a radical idea: The most critical threat facing
the United States now and for the foreseeable future is not a rising
China, a reckless North Korea, a nuclear Iran, modern terrorism, or
climate change. Although all of these constitute potential or actual
threats, [the biggest challenges facing the US are its]{.underline}
burgeoning debt, crumbling infrastructure, second-rate primary and
secondary schools, outdated immigration system, and [slow **economic
growth** -- in short, the domestic foundations of American
power.]{.underline}

Readers in other countries may be tempted to react to this judgment with
a dose of schadenfreude, finding more than a little satisfaction in
America's difficulties. Such a response should not be surprising. The US
and those representing it have been guilty of hubris (the US may often
be the indispensable nation, but it would be better if others pointed
this out), and examples of inconsistency between America's practices and
its principles understandably provoke charges of hypocrisy. When America
does not adhere to the principles that it preaches to others, it breeds
resentment.

But, like most temptations, [the urge to gloat at America's
imperfections and struggles ought to be resisted. People around the
globe should be careful what they wish for. America's failure to deal
with its internal challenges would **come at a steep
price**]{.underline}. Indeed**[, the rest of the world's stake in
American success is nearly as large as that of the US
itself.]{.underline}**

Part of the reason is economic. The US economy still accounts for about
one-quarter of global output. [If US growth accelerates, America's
capacity to consume other countries' goods and services will increase,
thereby **boosting growth around the world**]{.underline}. At a time
when Europe is drifting and Asia is slowing, [only the US]{.underline}
(or, more broadly, North America) [has the potential to drive **global
economic recovery**]{.underline}.

[The US remains a unique source of innovation]{.underline}. Most of the
world's citizens communicate with mobile devices based on technology
developed in Silicon Valley; likewise, the Internet was made in America.
More recently, [new technologies developed in the US greatly increase
the ability to extract **oil and natural gas** from underground
formations. This technology is now making its way around the globe,
allowing other societies to increase their **energy production and
decrease both their reliance on costly imports and their carbon
emissions**.]{.underline}

[The US is also an invaluable source of ideas]{.underline}. Its
world-class universities educate a significant percentage of future
world leaders. More fundamentally, the US has long been a leading
example of what market economies and democratic politics can accomplish.
People and governments around the world are far more likely to become
more open if the American model is perceived to be succeeding.

Finally, [the world faces many serious challenges, ranging from the need
to halt the **spread of weapons of mass destruction, fight climate
change, and maintain a functioning world economic order that promotes
trade and investment to regulating practices in cyberspace, improving
global health, and preventing armed conflicts**. These problems will not
simply go away or sort themselves out.]{.underline}

While Adam Smith's "invisible hand" may ensure the success of free
markets, it is powerless in the world of geopolitics. [Order requires
the visible hand of **leadership** to formulate and realize global
**responses to global challenges**.]{.underline}

Don't get me wrong: None of this is meant to suggest that the US can
deal effectively with the world's problems on its own. Unilateralism
rarely works. It is not just that the US lacks the means; the very
nature of contemporary global problems suggests that only collective
responses stand a good chance of succeeding.

But [multilateralism is much easier to advocate than to design and
implement. Right now **there is only one candidate for this role: the
US**. No other country has the necessary combination of capability and
outlook]{.underline}.

This brings me back to the argument that **[the US must put its house in
order]{.underline}** -- economically, physically, socially, and
politically -- [if it is to have the resources needed to promote order
in the world. Everyone should hope that it does: The alternative to a
world led by the US is not a world led by China, Europe, Russia, Japan,
India, or any other country, but rather **a world that is not led at
all. Such a world would almost certainly be characterized by chronic
crisis and conflict**]{.underline}. That would be bad not just for
Americans, but for the vast majority of the planet's inhabitants.

## 2NC DIB UQ

### 2NC UQ- Arms Sales Increasing/Up/Trump

#### Arms sales increasing -- sustains the DIB and solves a laundry list of impacts

**Thompson 18** (Loren Thompson, Chief Operating Officer of Lexington
Institute, Apr 20, 2018, \"Trump Drone Decree Signals Arms Exports Are
Now A Key Feature Of U.S. Economic Policy,\" Forbes,
https://www.forbes.com/sites/lorenthompson/2018/04/20/trump-drone-decree-signals-arms-exports-are-now-a-key-feature-of-u-s-economic-policy/#b2f560f32a56//KDES).

Donald [[Trump is turning out to be the best thing to happen to the
defense industry]{.mark} since Ronald Reagan left town. On Thursday of
this week, [the White House released a presidential memorandum loosening
the restrictions on overseas sales of unmanned aerial vehicles,
colloquially known as \"drones.\" Defense companies have been arguing
for years that regulations concerning the export of drones were too
burdensome, and enabled competitors to capture foreign
markets.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Clearly, the White House has heard these complaints.

But [[the implications]{.underline}]{.mark} of the April 19 memorandum
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} far more [[momentous]{.underline},]{.mark}
because [it commits the federal government to actively facilitating arms
sales to overseas allies and partners. [The government]{.mark} has
always been a participant in decisions to export weapons, but now it
looks [poised to become a promoter]{.mark}]{.underline}. The memorandum
cites several reasons why this is desirable: [it creates jobs, it
reduces the trade deficit, it spurs innovation, it maintains our
military\'s warfighting edge, and it reduces the need for other
countries to seek U.S. \"boots on the ground.\"]{.underline}

The Obama administration would have agreed in principle with many of
these objectives. In practice, though, [its baroque process for
reviewing proposed arms transfers often impeded the ability of U.S.
defense companies to compete in places like the Persian Gulf, and in the
case of unmanned aerial vehicles, it enabled China to seize a large
share of the global market.]{.underline}

Trump\'s memorandum won\'t open the floodgates to arms sales \--
Congress will still play a critical role in approving major transactions
\-- but [as [the new policy is]{.mark} implemented weapons sales to
other countries are nearly certain to increase, and that is [good news
for the defense industry]{.mark}. Some companies such as Boeing, General
Atomics, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Textron are positioned to reap
significant sales gains]{.underline} (I have financial ties of one sort
or another to most of these companies).

But there is more to this story than the loosening of curbs on arms
exports. Military production is getting wrapped into a broader White
House industrial policy aimed at revitalizing the entire U.S.
manufacturing base. The administration is about to release the results
of a year-long investigation into the health of the defense industrial
base, and it has included in its expansive definition of that sector
many basic industries that contribute production inputs to military
items.

To a far greater degree than any previous administration,
[the]{.underline} Trump [White House sees the defense industry as an
integral part of the overall industrial economy and a tool through which
it can bolster the health of struggling sectors such as steel and
aluminum.]{.underline} The traditional view of military contractors in
both Republican and Democratic administrations has been that they are a
unique and separate part of the economy \-- one requiring special
handling \-- but President Trump apparently favors a different approach.

In Trump\'s conception, Washington can get a lot more mileage out of its
defense dollars if it consciously includes economic and trade
considerations in its spending practices. The Pentagon is the world\'s
biggest purchaser of advanced technology and accounts for a significant
share of all domestic manufacturing jobs, so to Trump it is just common
sense that defense and economic policies should be viewed as different
facets of a unified agenda.

The Trump approach may seem novel in an American context, but it is
actually the way that most countries \-- including Russia and China \--
deal with their defense industries. Few nations have the luxury of
segregating their military producers from the rest of the economy, and
making purchases without regard to the potential economic and trade
fallout. So the Trump strategy actually aligns Washington with the way
most of our allies and adversaries think about military production and
arms exports.

Thursday\'s memorandum makes it clear that the U.S. will not be selling
weapons indiscriminately to all comers. Proposed transactions will still
be reviewed to ascertain that they are compatible with U.S. security
objectives. But the amount of time required will be greatly compressed
from what it was, and [[the volume of arms exports will likely grow
significantly]{.mark}. So if you thought things couldn\'t get any better
for the U.S. defense industry, guess again. They just did.]{.underline}

### 2NC UQ- CAT (Conventional Arms Transfers) Boost

#### CAT boosts the DIB -- considers economic security in arms deals

[Perhaps [the most significant change in President Trump's memorandum is
that it added "economic security" as a criterion to the arms transfer
decision-making process]{.mark}]{.underline}.4 Nearly twenty-five years
ago, President Clinton added a vague statement that the arms transfer
policy should "consider the impact on the US arms industry when deciding
whether to approve an export."5 Critics worried that Clinton's policy
would draw pork-barrel political considerations into US foreign
relations and that the effort to sustain the US defense industry would
work against prioritizing strategic and human rights concerns.[6 The
industrial goal subsequently faded until President Trump resurrected it
in his Spring 2019 new version of the CAT policy. Economic security
interests, as defined in the memorandum, include "bolster\[ing\] our
economy; spur\[ring\] research and development; enhanc\[ing\] the
ability of the defense industrial base to create jobs; \[and\]
increas\[ing\] our competitiveness in key markets.]{.underline} . . ."7

### 2NC UQ- Pentagon 

#### Pentagon is acting now -- recent reports prove

**Adams 18** (John Adams, president of Guardian Six Consulting, served
more than 30 years in command and staff assignments as an Army aviator,
military intelligence officer and foreign area officer in Europe, Asia,
the Middle East and Africa.. "The US needs to rebuild the defense
industrial base," The Hill, 10/29/18,
<https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/413635-the-us-needs-to-rebuild-the-defense-industrial-base>)
//Haus

This month [the Pentagon]{.underline} finally [released a]{.underline}
long-awaited [report on the health of the nation's defense industrial
base. The]{.underline} findings were startling. Once the nation's
strength -- in fact a war winner -- [our defense]{.underline} industrial
[base]{.underline} now [faces]{.underline} an "unprecedented set of
[challenges]{.underline}."

[The report is a clear sign we need to act urgently.]{.underline} Just
when we should be retooling for renewed great power competition, the
very foundation from which we project strength is crumbling.

While the report identified five major challenges to our defense
industrial base, all in need of dedicated attention, one challenge in
particular -- the aggressive industrial policies of competitor nations,
particularly China -- should cause heightened alarm. Many of the hurdles
we face to rebuilding our industrial base and supply chains are
self-imposed -- sequestration and ongoing budget uncertainty are prime
examples -- but the challenge posed by our growing dependence on
competitors, or nations that could become adversaries, for critical
materials will take a multi-faceted approach to reverse.

From specialized metals and alloys to printed circuit boards, our
dependence on imports for materials and components with such essential
applications across multiple Department of Defense programs and defense
sectors can't be allowed to deepen. For all of the value and efficiency
of a laissez faire market-first approach to resource acquisition and
industrial production, our non-market state-owned enterprise competitors
game the system to our loss. While [we rely on the market]{.underline}
and competition [and innovation to sharpen our manufacturing sector and
ensure access to key materials]{.underline}, American [companies must
compete]{.underline} in global markets [against]{.underline} Chinese
[state-owned competitors]{.underline} that have the full weight of
government support at their backs -- competitors that are happy to trade
profit for market share. The threat of China's strategy isn't new, but
the results of China's now decades-long planning and execution is.

One case study in the Pentagon's report on the materials sector pulls no
punches: "China represents a significant and growing risk to the supply
of materials deemed strategic and critical to U.S. national security."
Our shocking import dependence on minerals and metals is merely a
microcosm of the problem.

Despite our own vast reserves of minerals and metals, the U.S. is now 50
percent or more reliant on imports of 50 nonfuel mineral commodities and
fully 100 percent reliant on imports for 21 of those minerals. As
recently as 1978, the U.S. was 100 percent import reliant on just seven
minerals.

A troubling number of these minerals are dominated by domestic Chinese
production or by Chinese companies operating around the globe. Take our
100 percent import reliance on rare earth minerals. China has
monopolized the production of these 17 minerals, which are in a dizzying
array of military hardware. From F-22 and F-35 aircraft to guidance and
targeting systems, these minerals are essential to most of our advanced
weapons systems. That we have allowed to China to dominate their
production and processing defies comprehension.

The obvious question is, what can be done? [We]{.underline} must first
[begin with taking a comprehensive approach to U.S.
competitiveness]{.underline}. [Challenging unfair trade practices should
be part of that approach but reducing our self-imposed
barriers]{.underline} to competitiveness [must be]{.underline} part of
the equation [as well]{.underline}. Our redundant, broken mine
permitting process is a case in point.

It often takes a decade or more to gain the permits needed to open a new
mine in the U.S. In a competitive global market, those kinds of delays
and self-imposed barriers to investment are simply unacceptable. Despite
having environmental protections comparable to our own, mine permitting
in Australia and Canada takes just two to three years. It's no wonder,
despite our vast mineral resources, that mining companies increasingly
look elsewhere to invest in new production. We can -- and must -- do
better.

Under consideration for inclusion in this year's National Defense
Authorization Act was an amendment that would have brought desperately
needed mine permitting reform. It was dropped in the 11th hour but as
the Pentagon's new report makes clear, [access to raw materials is
an]{.underline} important defense [issue]{.underline} that [we
can't]{.underline} afford to [ignore]{.underline}.

[Rebuilding our defense industrial base is finally being given the
attention it deserves]{.underline}. How effectively we act remains to be
seen. However, the systemic challenges highlighted in the just-released
report can no longer go unaddressed. [A concerted effort from the
executive branch, Congress and the Department of Defense is needed
to]{.underline} undo years of damage caused by decades of complacency.
We must urgently [address]{.underline} our astonishing and growing
import dependence on the raw materials that are [the building blocks for
our]{.underline} most important [defense systems]{.underline}.

#### The report created urgency to act

**Duesterberg 18** (Thomas J. Duesterberg, senior fellow at Hudson
Institute. "Trump Administration Gets Serious About Defense Industrial
Base," Forbes, 16 October 2018,

//Haus

Throughout the 20th century, the U.S. manufacturing sector was the
defining pillar of the "Arsenal of Democracy." The size, technological
superiority and continuous innovation in this sector allowed not only
the preservation of democracy in the great conflagrations of the past
century, but also the creation of the global Pax Americana that
underlies one of the longest periods of peace and unprecedented
prosperity in world history. [The slow decline of]{.underline} that
[industrial superiority]{.underline}, however, [is beginning to
undermine U.S. economic vitality, as]{.underline} President [Trump keeps
reminding us, and our ability to support]{.underline} the [national
security dominance]{.underline} which has been the backbone of global
stability for over a century.

A long-awaited report from [the Administration released]{.underline}
earlier this month is the most comprehensive overview of this growing
problem and begins to outline [a systematic response to the
challenge]{.underline} it represents. The much-anticipated reckoning is
among the more significant government reports in generations. It also
provides important guidance for the emerging trade and industrial
renewal policies of the Trump Administration.

The document states at the outset that "...the [erosion of]{.underline}
American [manufacturing]{.underline} over the last two decades [has had
a negative impact on]{.underline} these [\[defense\]
capabilities]{.underline}...and threatens to undermine the ability of
U.S. manufacturing firms to meet security requirements." The report goes
into considerable detail about the loss of U.S. technological leadership
and production infrastructure in such critical sectors as robotics,
electronics, semiconductors, advanced communications, quantum computing,
shipbuilding, some elements of aerospace technology, advanced metal
forming, nuclear power, and access to critical raw materials. Another
growing concern across many industries is the shortage of skilled
production workers and STEM (science, technology, engineering and
mathematics) experts.

[While many of these issues have been chronicled before, the study marks
the first systematic effort to link the growing global competitive
environment to the national security needs of the world's leading
superpower.]{.underline} The report minces no words that the rise of
China, with its mercantilist and often illegal actions (in terms of
agreed international trade rules), is one of the most important factors
behind the looming loss of technical leadership so vital to national
security. The text states quite unambiguously:

China's capture of foreign technologies and intellectual property,
particularly the systematic theft of U.S. weapons systems and the
illicit and forced transfer of dual-use technology, has eroded the
military balance between the U.S. and China.... China's aggressive
industrial policies have already eliminated some capabilities with
critical defense functions.... China's actions seriously threaten other
capabilities....\"

[The]{.underline} Administration's [report]{.underline} helps [gives
substance and specificity to its trade policy]{.underline}. It
identifies key sectors and key technologies important to defense
capabilities, and the actions by the Chinese which threaten them.
[The]{.underline} catalogue of industries and technologies also provides
guidance to the recently strengthened CFIUS (Committee on Foreign
Investment in the United States) [law]{.underline} which [allows U.S.
authorities to review and block]{.underline}, if necessary, [foreign
acquisitions of key parts of the defense industrial base.]{.underline}
The report's emphasis on skills training in both the scientific and
production jobs in industries like nuclear power, shipbuilding and large
metal forging also is helpful to the work of the President's new
National Council for the American Worker. The group is charged with
leading an interdepartmental, government-wide effort to find ways to
overcome gaps in essential skills. Finally, the report outlines a series
of additional Federal actions to address the problems outlined in the
report. These include improving procurement strategies, strengthening
and broadening the domestic supply chain for domestic production, and
using Department of Defense programs to support specific
defense-critical industrial production and technology development.

In an opinion piece accompanying the release of the report, Assistant to
the President for Trade and Manufacturing Policy Peter Navarro rightly
argued that [the President's tax reform and deregulatory agenda is also
important in helping renew American manufacturing.]{.underline} There is
always some danger that the clarion call to rebuild specific industries,
especially in a time of heightened global competition from a rising
superpower, will be carried too far and the hand of government will
weigh too heavily on the traditional dynamism of the American private
sector. [Finding]{.underline} the right [balance among]{.underline} all
the [government tools---including]{.underline} trade, education,
regulation [and industrial]{.underline} support [programs---is never
easy, but the new report gives urgency to addressing the problems and
clarity about the industries that are essential to national
security.]{.underline} The complacency of recent decades needs to be
replaced by a new determination to find the right balance of more
activist policies in support of a 21st-century Arsenal of Democracy

in foreign arms sales,"
<https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/10/politics/trump-administration-foreign-arms-sales-2018/index.html>

[[US foreign military sales totaled \$55.66 billion in 2018, a 33%
increase]{.mark} compared to the nearly \$42 billion in weapons sold in
2017]{.underline}, the Defense Cooperation Agency announced Wednesday.

[[It is the highest annual total for military sales to foreign
governments since 2012]{.mark} when the US conducted upwards of \$69
billion in arms deals]{.underline} with allies and partners around the
world.

[The upward trend is due]{.underline}, in part, [to the Trump
administration\'s push to relax restrictions on foreign military
sales]{.underline}. Though critics suggest human rights concerns are
being relegated in the rush to increase sales.

Since taking office, President Donald [[Trump has demonstrated an
insatiable appetite for selling American weaponry
abroad]{.underline}]{.mark} \-- at times using face-to-face meetings
with foreign leaders to make a personal sales pitch.

[Trump signed a nearly \$110 billion defense deal with Saudi Arabia\'s
King]{.underline} Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud in May [last
year]{.underline} in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on what was his first
stop abroad as President.

In the same month, [the US government reauthorized the export of Paveway
munitions to Saudi Arabia]{.underline}, ending Obama\'s December 2016
ban.

[[He has also encouraged US officials to take on a more active role in

\"[These policy changes advance US national security and foreign policy

[The Trump administration informed congressional committees that it will
go ahead with 22 military sales]{.underline} to the Saudis, United Arab
Emirates and Jordan, infuriating lawmakers by circumventing a
long-standing precedent for congressional review of major weapons sales.

[Members of Congress had been blocking sales of offensive military
equipment to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for
months]{.underline}, angry about the huge civilian toll from their air
campaign in Yemen, as well as human rights abuses such as the murder of
Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate in Turkey.

Lawmakers and congressional aides warned earlier this week that
[Trump]{.underline}, frustrated with Congress holding up weapons deals
including the sale of bombs to Saudi Arabia, [was considering using a
loophole in arms control law to go ahead by declaring a national
emergency.]{.underline}

"President Trump is only using this loophole because he knows Congress
would disapprove \... There is no new 'emergency' reason to sell bombs
to the Saudis to drop in Yemen, and doing so only perpetuates the
humanitarian crisis there," said Senator Chris Murphy.

Murphy, a Democrat, made public on Twitter on Wednesday that Trump was
considering the loophole in the Arms Control Export Act to clear the
sales.

Several of Trump's fellow Republicans, as well as Democrats, said they
would object to such a plan, fearing that blowing through the "holds"
process would eliminate Congress' ability to check not just Trump but
future presidents from selling weapons where they liked.

Representative Mike McCaul, the top Republican on the House of
Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, said the administration's
action was "unfortunate" and likely to damage future White House
interactions with Congress.

"I would have strongly preferred for the administration to utilize the
long-established and codified arms sale review process," McCaul said in
a statement.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement that U.S.
partners in the Middle East needed the contracts to be completed to help
deter Iran, and that the decision to circumvent Congress was meant to be
a "one-time event."

[It is not the first time Congress and Trump have clashed]{.underline}
over policy in the region, or the division of powers between the White
House and Capitol Hill. The House and Senate voted to end U.S. military
support for the campaign in Yemen earlier this year, but Trump vetoed
the resolution.

BOON TO DEFENSE INDUSTRY In [[documents sent to
Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}, Pompeo [[listed a wide range of products
and services that would be provided to the
countries.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[They include]{.underline} Raytheon [precision-guided
munitions]{.underline} (PGMs), support for Boeing Co F-15
[aircraft]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} Javelin anti-tank
[missiles]{.underline}, which are made by Raytheon and Lockheed Martin
Corp.

Other companies that will benefit include General Electric, now cleared
to sell engines for use in F-16 fighter jets operated by the UAE and the
U.S. unit of French firm Thales, which was cleared to sell a fuzing
system for Paveway IV precision guided bombs to Britain and the UAE.

It will also likely be welcome news for Britain's BAE Systems Plc and
Europe's Airbus, clearing the way for installation of Paveway
laser-guided bombs on European-built Eurofighter and Tornado fighter
jets sold to Saudi Arabia, as well F-15 fighters built by Boeing.

"I am disappointed, but not surprised, that the Trump Administration has
failed once again to prioritize our long-term national security
interests or stand up for human rights, and instead is granting favors
to authoritarian countries like Saudi Arabia," Senator Bob Menendez said
in a statement.

Menendez, ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
vowed to fight the action, and said he was in talks with both Democrats
and some of Trump's fellow Republicans on ways to preserve congressional
review of arms sales.

The [[Foreign Relations]{.underline}]{.mark} Committee
[[chairman]{.underline}]{.mark}, Republican Senator Jim
[[Risch]{.underline}, [said he]{.underline}]{.mark} had
[[received]{.underline}]{.mark} formal [[notification of the
administration's intent to move forward.]{.underline}]{.mark}

In a statement, Risch said, "I am reviewing and analyzing the legal
justification for this action and the associated implications."

In his memorandum justifying the emergency declaration, Pompeo listed
years of actions by Iran. "Iranian malign activity poses a fundamental
threat to the stability of the Middle East and to American security at
home and abroad," he wrote, and cited "a number of troubling and
escalatory indications and warnings" from Tehran.

Trump's administration also announced that it was sending 1,500
additional troops to the Middle East, which it described as an effort to
bolster defenses against Iran against what it sees as a threat of
potential attack.

Members of Congress from both parties have worried that Trump is pushing
toward war with Iran. Clarke Cooper, assistant secretary of state for
political-military affairs, said the administration was responding to
important needs from partners.

"This is about deterrence and it's not about war," he told Reuters in a
telephone interview.

### 2NC UQ- DIB is up

#### DIB robust and strong, supplied by a stable base of contracts

**Goure 05** Daniel Gouré, Ph.D., 4-1-2005, \"The Military Helicopter
Industrial Base,\" Lexington Institute,
https://www.lexingtoninstitute.org/the-military-helicopter-industrial-base///ALiang

The health of the defense industrial base (DIB) continues to be a
concern for the Department of Defense and U.S. lawmakers. The end of the
Cold War saw a major contraction in the size of the defense industrial
base and the number of major defense companies. As defense budgets
declined, programs were truncated, extended or even terminated. Defense
companies merged and some even left the sector entirely. [Recent
increases in defense spending due in large part to the events of 9/11
and the war in Iraq have been insufficient to return the DIB to its
former relatively robust state. Projections for future defense budgets
and anticipated procurement plans have provoked concerns regarding some
sectors of the DIB and certain producers of defense goods]{.underline}.

One sector where observers have expressed some concerns is military
helicopters or rotorcraft. [Currently, there are four "major" prime
contractors for helicopters in the United States: Sikorsky, Bell, Boeing
and now Lockheed.These companies make up over 75 percent of the world
production capability for military and commercial
rotorcraft.]{.underline}

Each of the U.S. manufacturers is producing and supporting a number of
military and/or commercial helicopters. Sikorsky is responsible for the
military's UH/MH-60 and CH-53 helicopters. Bell produces the UH-1Y and
AH-1Z for the Marine Corps and is co-developing the V-22 tilt-rotor
aircraft with Boeing. Boeing's major products are the AH-64 Apache and
the CH-47 Chinook. Each [of these programs has recently been selected on
a sole-source basis for not only major upgrades but also for the
production of a substantial number (hundreds) of new
helicopter]{.underline}s. Lockheed Martin won the Presidential
helicopter (VXX) competition with the US101 for 23 helicopters. Pending
military helicopter contracts -- the armed reconnaissance helicopter
(ARH), light utility helicopter (LUH) and personnel recovery vehicle
(PRV) -- will expand current demand. Finally, most of these companies
have plans for new commercial vehicles, some based on their successful
military designs.

This is not a sector that is in danger. There is very strong demand for
helicopters within each of the military Services. The four prime
contractors are all in good financial condition. [They have a stable
base of orders from existing contracts, including new production,
remanufacture and upgrades. Moreover, the potential market is likely to
increase significantly over the next decade giving each an opportunity
to grow their business. Therefore, the Department of Defense can be
confident that with a competitive acquisition process this sector will
serve DoD's needs well.]{.underline}

### 2NC UQ AT: Aging Crisis 

#### Aging crisis affect other countries more than US

**Haas 07,** Mark L. Haas, A Geriatric Peace? The Future of U.S. Power
in a World of Aging Populations, International Security, Vol. 32, No. 1
(Summer, 2007), pp. 112-147, The MIT Press//ALiang

Population aging in the great powers will be a potent force for the
prolongation of U.S. power dominance in the twenty-first century for
three principal reasons. First, the massive costs and probable slowdowns
in economic growth created by aging populations will inhibit the other
major powers from increas- ing military expenditures anywhere close to
matching U.S. defense spending; these factors are even likely to push
many of these states to reduce their mili- tary expenditures from
current levels. Second, with aging populations and shrinking workforces,
[the other great powers will have to spend increasing percentages of
their defense budgets on personnel costs and military pen at the expense
of purchasing the most technologically sophisticated
weaponry]{.underline}. [The more money that states spend on military
personnel and pensions as op- posed to weapons, the lower the likelihood
will be of these countries challenging U.S. military
dominance]{.underline}.\'\" The third factor reinforces both of the
previous points. [Although the U.S. population is aging, it is doing so
to a lesser extent and less quickly than those of the other great powers
(even India\'s population, though it will remain younger than that of
the United States for the first half of the twenty-first century, is
aging significantly faster than the U.S. population). As a result, the
pressures pushing for the crowding out of military spending in favor of
elderly care and the increasing substitution of labor for capital within
defense budgets will be considerably smaller for the United States than
for potential great power competitors, to the great benefit of its
relative power position in coming decades. In 2005 the United States
spent more than \$478 billion on defense.]{.underline} [This figure was
nearly \$290 billion more than the next largest military spender
(China)]{.underline}, and roughly equal to the combined military
spending of China, France, India, Japan, Russia, and the United
Kingdom.45 Global aging significantly decreases the likelihood of
potential competitors closing this huge spending gap

The principal contention of this section is that there is likely to be a
[strong negative relationship between the magnitude of a state\'s aging
crisis (the independent variable) and the level of its military
expenditures (the dependent variable).]{.underline} With aging
populations, governments will be under such pressure to pay for massive
new expenditures for the elderly (and most likely in the con- text of
slowing economic growth) that all other discretionary spending will
likely be affected. High levels of aging crisis, at a minimum, are
likely to be a powerful force [inhibiting states from significantly
increasing defense spending and, at a maximum, will tend to result in
reductions in existing levels of military expenditures.46 I define
\"aging crisis\" by the following eight criteria that are designed to
measure both the magnitude of the costs for elderly care confronting
states and their ability to pay them.]{.underline} Is a state\'s
fertility rate below replacement levels? Will at least one-quarter of a
country\'s population be above the retire- ment age in 2050? Will a
state\'s working-age population (ages 15 to retirement) decrease between
now and 2050? Are a state\'s senior citizens highly reliant on their
government to provide reasonable levels of welfare and health care? Does
a state presently possess high levels of debt (more than 50 percent of
GDP)? Are a country\'s overall tax rates already relatively high (more
than 30 percent of GDP)? Finally, does a state currently possess a
relatively low per ca- pita GDP (less than \$12,000)? In what follows, I
provide an analysis of the aging situations in all the great powers and
the likely effects of this variable on these states\' military
expenditures (see Table 8 for a synopsis of findings).

#### Social Aging in US is minimal compared to other arms exporters, stable population growth forecasts future economic growth 

**Haas 07,** Mark L. Haas, A Geriatric Peace? The Future of U.S. Power
in a World of Aging Populations, International Security, Vol. 32, No. 1
(Summer, 2007), pp. 112-147, The MIT Press//ALiang

Like the other great powers, the [United States is an aging
society]{.underline}. Consequently[, it will face many of the same
economic and fiscal burdens. According to one estimate, U.S. public
obligations to the elderly for pensions and health care are expected to
rise by 11 percent of GDP by 2040]{.underline}, to an overall level of
roughly 20 percent of GDP.85 David Walker, comptroller general of the
General Accountability Office, stated in 2005 [that the United States
faces \"a demo- graphic tsunami\" that \"will never recede.\"86 The
Congressional Budget Office projects that by 2015, spending on the
elderly will total almost \$1.8 trillion, which is nearly half of the
anticipated federal budget.87 Health-care costs, in particular, are the
United States\' biggest problem with regard to social aging. The United
States spends more than twice as much per capita in this area than any
other industrial great power (though it ranks forty-fifth in the world
in life expectancy).88]{.underline} According to conservative estimates,
absent reforms, the costs of Medicare alone will be at least \$2.6
trillion in 2050, in real terms, which is roughly the size of the
current U.S. federal budget.89 [Despite these expected cost increases,
the United States is in significantly better shape to address the
challenges created by its aging population than are the other powers
(with the possible exception of Britain). In a study funded by the
Center for Strategic and International Studies]{.underline} that ranks
developed states by both the magnitude of the aging crisis confronting
them and governments\' ability to pay for it[, the United States and the
United Kingdom are the only great powers considered to be of \"low
vulnerability\" in these areas]{.underline}. The authors of the study
deem the United States\' aging crisis to be roughly one-third as severe
as that confronting Germany and Japan, and one-fourth as severe as the
one France will face.90 Even authors who concentrate [on the substantial
costs of the United States\' aging problems note that these problems are
\"mild\" compared with those in other powers, which have it \"far
worse\" than the United States.91 The United States is currently the
youngest of all the Group of Eight nations. Because it has the highest
fertility and immigration rates of all these countries, it will
maintain, even strengthen, this position in coming decades.]{.underline}
In 2050 [the United States\' median age will be the lowest of any of the
great powers except India, in most cases by a substantial extent (see
Table 4]{.underline}). (China\'s median age will surpass the United
States\' by 2020, and India is rapidly gaining on the United States in
this area.) Perhaps most important, [while the working-age populations
in all the other great powers (once again except for India) are
predicted by 2050 to either decline (China, France, Germany, Japan, and
Russia- in the case of the last three, precipitously) or increase
modestly (Britain), this demographic group is expected to increase by 31
percent in the United States]{.underline} (see Table 5).92 [The United
States\' relatively youthful demographics will help greatly with the
fiscal challenges created by social aging]{.underline}. [The United
States\' growing labor force over the next fifty years will contribute
to an expanding economy, thereby providing the government with
additional revenue without having to increase taxes, borrow more money,
or cut other spending]{.underline}. In addition, the United States has a
relatively well funded pension system (especially in relation to China,
France, Germany, India, and Russia);93 its public welfare commitments to
the elderly are relatively modest compared with those of other
industrialized powers;94 its citizens work many more hours per year and
significantly later in life than the average individual in the other
powers;95 andits tax burden is low compared with those of other
powers.96 Again, these facts do not mean that the United States will
escape the fiscal burdens created by social aging or that this
phenomenon will not create negative ramifications for U.S. security.
Rather, as burdensome as the public costs of aging will be for the
United States, the public benefits owed to U.S. seniors as a percentage
of GDP (i.e., pensions and health care) will likely remain substantially
lower than in most of the other great powers (see the third column in
Table 7). Moreover, the United States will be better positioned to pay
for these costs than almost all the other major actors in the system.
[As a result, global aging will be a powerful force for the continuation
of the relative power dominance of the United States.]{.underline}

Based on the criteria elaborated in the previous paragraph, [six of the
eight great powers in coming decades will confront massive challenges
created by their aging populations: China, France, Germany, India,
Japan, and Russia.]{.underline} Five of these six states satisfy at
least [five of the eight criteria for identifying a high level of
crisis.]{.underline} France and Germany meet seven, Russia and China
six. India satisfies only four of these criteria, but scores so poorly
in three of them (seniors\' dependence on government, [expected
increases in elderly obligations, and current per capita GDP) that it
merits inclusion into the high-crisis category]{.underline}. I begin my
analysis [with the aging problems in China, which is the state most
frequently mentioned as a likely balancer of the United States. Of all
the great powers, China will face particularly severe fiscal challenges
due to de- mographic trends]{.underline}. These challenges will begin to
hit [with substantial force in only ten to fifteen years, when China\'s
large postwar baby boom generation begins to reach retirement age.
Rising longevity in China and the \"one child policy,\" which has helped
lower China\'s fertility to a current rate of 1.7, have made China a
rapid aging society.]{.underline} By 2050 China\'s median age is
predicted to be nearly 45, which will be one of the oldest in the world
(the oldest country in the world today, Japan, has a median age of just
under 43).47 The ratio of working-age adults to elderly will shrink from
just under 10 in 2000 to 2.5 by 2050.48 China today has roughly 100
million citizens over the age of 65. In only twenty years, this number
will double. Roughly thirty years from now, it is expected to triple.\'

[Russia also currently faces substantial demographic challenges that, in
one prominent scholar\'s estimation, \"may be fairly characterized as
severe, dra- matic, and even critical.\"68 In addition to a declining
workforce, an exploding retirement population, an underfunded pension
system, and low levels of financial independence among seniors,69 Russia
confronts a demographic chal- lenge unlike any of the other great
powers: significant, long-term retrogression in the nation\'s overall
health. The deterioration of the health of Russian citi- zens has
resulted in a substantial decline in life expectancy since the 1960s and
will no doubt retard economic expansion.]{.underline} In the context of
slowing eco- nomic growth and fewer, less healthy working-age adults,
[Russia\'s govern- ment will have difficulty preserving reasonable
levels of welfare for its aging population without significant cuts in
other spending, including for economic development and
defense.]{.underline} As Nicholas Eberstadt puts it, \"[The specter of a
swelling population of elderly pensioners dependent for support on an
un- healthy and diminishing population of low-income workers suggests
some particularly unattractive trade-offs between welfare and
growth]{.underline}. Should Russian resources be allocated to capital
accumulation or to consumption for the unproductive elderly? Given
Russia\'s population structure, the question cannot be finessed.\"[70
The aging crises in Japan, Germany, France, and Russia are already
influ- encing defense spending in these states]{.underline}. In December
[2004 Japan cut military spending by 3.7 percent from the average of the
previous five budgets. The cuts were engineered by finance ministry
officials \"who demanded more social spending for Japan\'s rapidly aging
population.\"]{.underline}71 This trend continued the following
December, when the defense budget was reduced by another 0.9 percent to
help pay for the \"growing burdens \[resulting\] from an aging popu-
lation.\"72 In fact, [the Japanese government has stated that over the
next dec- ade, general expenditures will have to be cut by 25 to 30
percent \"to cope with inevitable increases in social security-related
spending given the nation\'s rap- idly aging
population]{.underline}.\"73 In February 2006 the EU Commission warned
Germany that it had to cut substantially discretionary spending across
the board \"to cope with the costs of an aging population.\" Germany\'s
finance minister, Peer Steinbrueck, speak- ing on behalf of the
government, agreed with this analysis and promised to put the
commission\'s recommendations into practice.74 This thinking contin- ues
a policy that Germany has followed over the last decade of \"letting
defense spending languish . . . while investing in social welfare
programs in- stead.\" Even in the post-September 11 world, \"cutting
social programs or raising taxes to buy weapons is considered \[in
Germany\] politically impossible.\"75

Another [[motivating factor for improving security assistance is the
continued success of the US defense-industrial
base]{.underline}]{.mark}. Without a strong industrial base, bolstered
by international transfers[, prices of [US acquisitions could increase
at a time when other nation's defense budgets are falling]{.mark}.
Decreased US defense spending will aggravate market deviations already
prevalent in the relatively closed and single-buyer, or monopolistic,
arms industry]{.underline}. Throughout various defense sectors, [few
major prime contractors are capable of producing key products, hampering
competition.]{.underline} The situation is even more perilous among
subcomponent manufacturers. For example, in the precision guided
munitions sector, Eagle Picher produces almost all thermal battery
units; Honeywell produces Inertial Measurement Units (IMU); and Rockwell
Collins produces Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers. All three
are primarily the sole-source suppliers of Raytheon, Lockheed Martin,
and Boeing.4 Another example can be seen in the world of mine warfare
where the Navy's Mk71 Naval Quickstrike Mines program has faltered as
the only company manufacturing a component of the Target Detection
Device went out of business. [Further defense cuts, absent compensating
offsets, could significantly affect the industry]{.underline}. Critics
might argue defense cuts will stabilize the market and rectify market
errors. In doing so, however, they assume the defense industry is a
truly competitive market, which is certainly not the case. Rather, a
[[key element of sustaining the defense-industrial base will be export
sales as a means for sustaining production lines and generating revenues
(profits) necessary for long-term research and
development]{.underline}]{.mark}. Recognizing these trends, a number of
[national defense companies around the globe, particularly in
Europe,]{.underline} such as BAE Systems and Fincantierri, Matthew L.
Merighi and Timothy A. Walton 100 Parameters [have shifted the majority
of their operations abroad, including to the United States, establishing
parallel "home markets." [With a number of major actors in the defense
market generally spending less on defense, international competition
will be fierce. US defense companies have made
adjustments]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, in [Boeing's defense unit
foreign sales currently make up 18 percent of its sales, compared with 7
percent six years ago, and the company has a goal of boosting this
market share to 25 percent within the next five years.5 According to the
DSCA, despite fierce competition, US companies are expected to have sold
a record \$46.1 billion in military hardware to foreign
governments]{.underline} in 2011.6 By value, the United States already
is the largest arms exporter in the world, and defense goods and
services are one of the strongest US exports. Additional exports will be
needed to pick up any slack generated by US defense reductions. Also,
[[more exports are required in an effort to sustain the US strategic
advantage in such areas as aerospace systems.]{.mark}]{.underline} To
sustain this US advantage, internal government and industry procedures
require comprehensive reform.

Arms Sales in the Middle East: Trends and Analytical Perspectives for
U.S. Policy, <https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/R44984.pdf>) (CB)

[[Arms sales are an important contributor to the U.S. aerospace and
defense industry,]{.mark} a sector that directly employs over 1 million
workers, with another 3 million working in support]{.underline}.7
According to one industry observer, [[international sales have made up
20 percent of U.S. firms' total sales in recent
years]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [[industry executives reportedly expect
that figure to grow.]{.underline}8 [Middle Eastern states play a
critical role in sustaining this industry. In early 2014, it was
reported that, as the U.S. Navy looked to shift from the F-18 to the new
Lockheed Martinproduced F-35,]{.underline} [Boeing's F-18 assembly line
in St. Louis, MO,]{.underline}]{.mark} [could close within two and a
half years. Similar projections were made for the F-15 production line,
which would come to an end in 2019 after fulfilling a large order from
Saudi Arabia]{.underline}. However, two large deals with other Middle
Eastern partners (Kuwait and Qatar9) appeared to save those lines from
closure and extend their operations into at least 2020. Similar dynamics
have played out in South Carolina (where a potential deal with Bahrain
for a number of F-16s could boost a Lockheed-Martin plant in the
state),10 Ohio (where Saudi orders have sustained General Dynamics tank
production in Lima),11 Massachusetts (home to Raytheon, whose production
of the Patriot air and missile defense system was rejuvenated by a 2008
UAE deal),12 and elsewhere. House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee
Chairwoman Kay Granger, in response to a Trump Administration decision
to delay some military aid to Egypt, said that when sales are curtailed,
"the companies and the workers that put that equipment together in the
United States are hurt."13 Opponents of specific arms sales sometimes
characterize these potential economic benefits as short-term or
incommensurate with the potential downsides. During a June 2017 debate
over sales of air munitions to Saudi Arabia, Senator Rand Paul
criticized those who would justify the deal as "a jobs program," saying
that "we are going to give money to people who behead you and crucify
you to create jobs. That should never be the way we make a decision
about arms sales in our country."14

#### Arms reduction kills jobs -- spirals into collapsing other weapon industries

**Eaglen 09** Mackenzie Eaglen, 5-22-2009, \"Maintaining the Superiority
of America\'s Defense Industrial Base,\" Heritage Foundation,
https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/maintaining-the-superiority-americas-defense-industrial-base//ALiang

The FY 2009 defense authorization and appropriations bills provided
funding for Lot 7 through Lot 9, with Lot 9 beginning the second year of
production in 2010. Congress also provided an additional \$523 million
to the Air Force either for long-lead items for an additional 20
aircraft in Lot 10 or to begin permanently closing the production line.
Only \$140 million of this was to be made available until President
Obama chose whether to continue or terminate the program. Given that
President Obama\'s FY 2010 budget request ends production at 186
aircraft, the long-lead production that generally takes place in the
first year will not occur in 2010, and the entire line will be closed by
December
2011.[\[13\]](https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/maintaining-the-superiority-americas-defense-industrial-base#_ftn13)
[Not releasing the funds for the long-lead production items approved
last year has serious implications for America\'s defense industrial
base. There are more than 25,000 direct American jobs with 1,000
suppliers in 44 states that help build these advanced fighter jets, and
more than 70,000 other jobs are tied indirectly to the
program]{.underline}. The highly technical jobs that make up the program
form the basis for America\'s specialized aerospace industry. Many of
the [smaller companies involved in the initial long-lead production
phase rely on the program for the bulk of their business and will be the
first to be negatively affected if Congress does not reverse President
Obama\'s proposal and fund Lot 10]{.underline}. Indeed, work for [third-
and fourth-tier F-22 suppliers is \"already drying
up.\"]{.underline}[[\[14\]](https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/maintaining-the-superiority-americas-defense-industrial-base#_ftn14)
Shutting down the F-22 production line while also potentially closing
other lines in the next few years\--including the F-18, F-16, and C-17,
as well as full-rate production of the F-35, which is not expected to
commence until 2012\--could further affect America\'s aerospace
workforce as the market for highly skilled aerospace jobs continues to
diminish]{.underline}. The gap between F-22 and F-35 production is of
particular concern. Because these programs share approximately 75
percent of suppliers who have specialized in fifth-generation platforms,
a two- or three-year gap in production would threaten the supply base
and truncate the next generation of aerospace designers, engineers, and
manufacturers.[\[15\]](https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/maintaining-the-superiority-americas-defense-industrial-base#_ftn15)
Indeed, the supplier base may be most affected by the Pentagon\'s
decisions to end programs with no follow-on production, yet suppliers
are often lost in the shadow of the larger defense firms that are
critical to the health of the defense industrial base. The 2009 Annual
Industrial Capabilities Report to Congresscautions that: \[T\]he
lower-tier supplier industrial base continues to consolidate. [Suppliers
not associated with future production programs (for example, suppliers
not participating in the F-35 or UH-60M) will be impacted the
most]{.underline}. These suppliers will be forced to either exit the
business or find new DoD or non-DoD programs for their
survival.[\[16\]](https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/maintaining-the-superiority-americas-defense-industrial-base#_ftn16)
The deterioration of the supplier base, even if it is determined that,
as Secretary Gates has said, \"U.S. predominance in conventional
warfare\...is sustainable for the medium term given current
trends,\"[\[17\]](https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/maintaining-the-superiority-americas-defense-industrial-base#_ftn17)
is sure to have a lasting impact on the nation\'s ability to maintain
its predominant position in the decades ahead as U.S. military power
inevitably diminishes. During his April 6 press conference, Secretary
Gates addressed the transition between F-22 and F-35 production and how
it will affect the workforce. Noting that F-22 jobs will decline to
19,000 in FY 2010 and 13,000 in FY 2011, he emphasized that the F-35
program already directly employs 38,000 people. This number will
increase to 64,000 in FY 2010 and 82,000 in FY 2011. What Secretary
Gates failed to mention, however, is that these production lines are in
different states. The implicit assumption that the production workforce
in Marietta, Georgia, will be willing or able to move to Fort Worth,
Texas, in order to work there is flawed. [There is no Pentagon guarantee
that these jobs can even be shifted on a one-to-one basis.]{.underline}
Even if there was a guarantee that no net job losses would occur, there
is no reason to believe that workers in Georgia would uproot their
families and that they could sell their homes in order to move even if
they wanted to do so. For the past three decades, the United States has
maintained two or three active production lines of fighter aircraft at
all times. Given the potential closure of the F-18 and F-15 lines,
combined with the three-year gap before full-rate production of the
F-35, [prematurely closing the F-22 line could jeopardize America\'s
ability to hedge against potential miscalculations of the future threat
environment]{.underline}. Over the past decade, Congress has put its
money where its mouth is by repeatedly emphasizing the importance of
competition in defense production. If additional annual funding for an
alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter is important to Congress,
there is no doubt that Congress should care deeply about maintaining
more than a single fighter production line. [Competition encourages
contractor innovation and produces better products for the warfighter
while saving taxpayer money in the long term.]{.underline} If Congress
allows President Obama to prevail with the decision to cap F-22s at 186,
in reality, this translates to only roughly 100 \"combat-coded\" F-22s
available for operations at any one
time.[\[18\]](https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/maintaining-the-superiority-americas-defense-industrial-base#_ftn18)
Yet more than 30 air campaign studies over the past 15 years have
confirmed a minimum requirement for 260 Raptors. Even when considering
the Air Force\'s current F-22 and F-35 procurement plans, a likely gap
of up to 800 fighters is projected to occur around
2024.[\[19\]](https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/maintaining-the-superiority-americas-defense-industrial-base#_ftn19)
Although the F-22A is the world\'s sole fifth-generation fighter,
numerous studies have concluded that the quality of the platform can be
stretched only so far in making up for a lack of quantity, specifically
in a Chinese anti-access scenario in the Taiwan
Strait.[\[20\]](https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/maintaining-the-superiority-americas-defense-industrial-base#_ftn20)
[A shortfall of aircraft would also prevent the Air Force from filling
out the service\'s 10 Air Expeditionary Forces (AEFs), undermining the
stability of the AEFs by ensuring the need to rotate F-22s on an
as-needed
basis.]{.underline}[[\[21\]](https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/maintaining-the-superiority-americas-defense-industrial-base#_ftn21)
The considerable investment the U.S. has made in the F-22 program over
the past two decades has brought the program to a point where it is now
at its most affordable level]{.underline}. After a development cost of
\$40 billion, the flyaway cost of one plane has been reduced by 35
percent, to about \$191 million per
aircraft.[\[22\]](https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/maintaining-the-superiority-americas-defense-industrial-base#_ftn22)
There is also an additional and significant cost burden to America\'s
taxpayers to fund new production at a future date if Congress ever chose
to reopen the line. As a substitute for the F-22, [Secretary Gates and
others in the defense and think tank community have advocated purchasing
more F-35s.]{.underline} Any such equation is insufficient, however,
because [the aircraft are complementary with only some overlapping
capabilities. These two fighters are designed and built to complete many
unique missions]{.underline}. The F-22, a larger and more maneuverable
aircraft, was meant to fulfill air dominance missions, thereby clearing
the skies for the multi-role strike mission of the F-35. Indeed, this
complementary mission set specifically assumed that the F-22 would be
available in sufficient quantity to provide air cover for the F-35.
Without enough F-22s to eliminate any air-to-air and surface-to-air
threats, the F-35 will become increasingly and unnecessarily vulnerable.
The F-22 also clears the skies for intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance platforms otherwise threatened by advanced surface-to-air
missiles placed along border regions during combat to provide critical
information to commanders on the
ground.[\[23\]](https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/maintaining-the-superiority-americas-defense-industrial-base#_ftn23)

#### Arms sales key

But this year's event is being held in the shadow of [Trump's most
controversial policies]{.underline}: his erratic approach to foreign
affairs and his economic protectionism, including steep tariffs he has
imposed on steel and aluminum. Those measures [and the resulting
uncertainty are prompting]{.underline} some [European countries to go
their own way on major industry projects,]{.underline} including the
development of a next-generation fighter jet, potentially [leaving U.S.
firms behind.]{.underline} "I think it is forcing Europe together in
ways that have unanticipated consequences for the U.S. defense
industry," said Byron Callan, an analyst with Capital Alpha Partners.
The aerospace and [defense industry is a huge driver of]{.underline}
U.S. jobs and [economic growth]{.underline}. In 2017 alone, it generated
\$865 billion, [supporting 2.4 million high-paying American
jobs.]{.underline} The industry produced a positive trade balance of
\$86 billion in 2017, the largest of any U.S. industry, which reduced
the country's trade deficit by 10 percent. It is also an important
component of U.S. foreign policy. [Arms sales are key to strengthening
security partnerships and improving military cooperation with allies.
"Partners who procure American weaponry are more capable of fighting
alongside us and ultimately more capable of protecting themselves with
fewer American boots on the ground,"]{.underline} Peter Navarro, [the

[[The U.S. defense-industrial sector is primed for rapid and significant
growth, but conventional export policies and lengthy determination
processes may be undermining the future health of the companies that
support America's safety, security and economic vitality.]{.mark} To do
so is to ultimately enable our enemies and their industries to grow, and
with that growth to develop products that will, if not checked, defeat
U.S. military capability.]{.underline}

[From aviation platforms to ammo, most allied and friendly nations
around the world are unable to fully support their military forces with
their own indigenous industries. Why? Because they are unable to
financially sustain the breadth of industries needed]{.underline} to
ensure military readiness, and because their industries were unable to
compete effectively internationally to offset the limited domestic
investment by their government.

[[America's manufacturing and defense industrial base -- vital to
ensuring our national security -- is under significant threat at a time
when]{.mark}]{.underline} the military [[capabilities
of]{.underline}]{.mark} China, Russia, and our other strategic
[[competitors are growing.]{.underline}]{.mark} This is an enormously
important issue that has received far less attention in the news media
than it deserves.

Fortunately, President [[Trump has]{.underline}]{.mark} long
[[recognized that to be strong and secure our nation must be able to
rely on U.S. companies to manufacture products needed for our national
defense]{.mark}.]{.underline} He understands that we must never become
dependent on foreign nations to design, produce and maintain the
aircraft, ground combat vehicles, ships, munitions, components of our
nuclear arsenal, and space [[capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[are critically important to our nation's defense]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Additionally, manufacturing remains a key source of jobs and our
economic strength. While President Obama was content to see
manufacturing jobs exit the U.S. for other nations, President Trump's
wise America First policies are strengthening American manufacturing and
creating well-paid jobs for hardworking Americans.

President [Trump signed an executive order in July 2017 directing the
secretary of defense to assess what must be done to strengthen our
manufacturing and defense industrial base.]{.underline} The report
giving this assessment was recently released and reveals hundreds of
gaps and vulnerabilities that demand immediate attention. Under this
administration, they will get that attention.

This landmark report outlines ways to harness the capabilities of
industry and government to work together to defend our country
effectively and efficiently, ensuring that taxpayer dollars are spent
frugally and wisely.

President [[Trump understands that that best way to deter our enemies
and prevent war is for America to have the strongest
military]{.underline}]{.mark} in the world -- [[a
goal]{.underline}]{.mark} he has [[achieved with]{.underline}]{.mark}
increased investment in our nation's [[defense]{.underline}]{.mark}. And
he knows that if we are forced into a conflict, we must give the brave
men and women in our armed forces what they need to prevail
overwhelmingly.

As Congress takes up the annual defense budget, it is worth
acknowledging the comfort and quality of life to which we are accustomed
owes its legacy in no small part to the collaborative force of [the
[greatest public-private partnership in American history: the
defense-industrial base]{.underline}.]{.mark}

Those who would downplay this partnership may not fully grasp the extent
to which the U.S. has benefited immeasurably beyond its immediate
national security needs. From safe and reliable commercial aviation, to
cancer research and treatment, to the internet itself, the [[innovation
that has supported our military]{.underline}]{.mark} over the decades
have [[simultaneously enhanced the lives of all
Americans]{.underline}.]{.mark}

The advantages accrued by the nation's investment in technology have not
always been readily apparent, and the relationship has not always been
easy or straightforward. The U.S. military often has to create an
industrial capability where once there was none.

Fortunately, the DNA of the [[commercial technology sector is directly
intertwined into our]{.underline}]{.mark} robust and diverse
[[defense-industrial base]{.mark}.]{.underline} Influencing current
innovation ranging from satellite telecommunication to hybrid vehicles,
Silicon Valley itself and countless university labs owe their founding
to defense investment grants and contracts.

Beyond the qualitative measures of these standout technologies, the
[defense-industrial base supports]{.underline} one of the [largest
high-skill and high-wage workforces in the nation.]{.underline} Indeed,
the [U.S. defense]{.underline} and aerospace industry [employs 2.4
million workers]{.underline} with an average salary 44 percent above the
national average.

Despite antiquated procurement practices imposed by Congress and
successive administrations, today's industrial base is flexible and
resilient and able to meet every U.S. military requirement without fail.
By every measure, that is success.

But as the late Sen. John McCain cautioned at the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce in 2015, global research and development is more than twice
that of the United States, and Chinese R&D levels are projected to
surpass the United States by 2022.

As recently noted in the context of U.S. space dominance being under
challenge by foreign competitors, we must unharness American ingenuity
and allow industry to develop and deploy innovation at increasing speed
and efficiency.

No different than other industrial sectors, defense companies
reorganized and internally reformed over the past few decades. Today,
America's top defense suppliers zealously manage their own compliance
and contract performance, rather than relying on government procurement
officers to oversee product development milestones and service delivery.

As legislative and executive branch policymakers resolve budget
differences over the coming months, it is worth recognizing the broad
and diffused impact of such deliberations over the years. [From the
convenience of weather data and digital photography to omnipresent
mobile communications[, the innovation of our defense-industrial base
has delivered for all Americans.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### DIB k2 US jobs, economy, and security

**Navarro, 3-19-19** (Peter Navarro, an assistant to the president and
the director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy. "Why
America needs a stronger defense industry", New York Times) //GB

In terms of economic security, the [Trump defense budget is helping to
create good manufacturing jobs at good wages, including in communities
like Lima that have fallen behind economically.]{.underline} The
revitalized Lima plant will directly employ a little more than 1,000
employees. [And plants like the one in Lima are drivers for thousands of
more jobs in the supply chain across the country]{.underline}.

Consider, for example, the ripple effects of the Lima plant. In Ohio
alone, 198 of its suppliers are spread out across the state's 16
congressional districts. These mostly small and medium-size businesses
churn out components ranging from bearings, castings and industrial
packaging to electronic assemblies, pressure gauges and steel. [The
impact is not limited to Ohio]{.underline}. Honeywell
[manufactures]{.underline} the Abrams engine [in Alabama]{.underline},
Allison manufactures its transmissions in I[ndiana]{.underline}, the
tank's main gun is made at the Watervliet Arsenal in [New
York]{.underline}, special armor comes from the Idaho National
Laboratory, [and]{.underline} the gun tube preforms come
from Ellwood [in Pennsylvania.]{.underline}

[In terms of national security, state of the art tanks like the latest
versions of the Abrams are critical tools in increasing the
effectiveness of American ground forces, enabling the decisive defeat of
the threats outlined in our National Security]{.underline} Strategy and
National Defense Strategy. A less obvious, but no less important,
benefit comes from sharing these upgraded combat vehicle capacities with
our allies and strategic partners through conventional arms sales.

In the Middle East, Kuwait's tank fleet consists of 218 Abrams tanks,
and its military is planning to double that number. Saudi Arabia has 374
recently upgraded Abrams tanks, while Egypt has the largest fleet, at
1,130. Australia commands a fleet of 59 Abrams tanks and may order 100
more. Taiwan may soon buy 108 Abrams tanks as well. [Those arms sales
not only help create good jobs at good wages in America]{.underline} ---
a principle not well understood by the Obama administration --- [they
also enhance America's capacity to bolster and stabilize our regional
alliances]{.underline}, even as they may reduce the need to deploy more
American soldiers overseas.

Association, organization that advocates for policies and investments

The [[defense industrial base is a national strategic asset that has
provided the United States with a marked advantage in defense technology
for more than six decades]{.mark}.]{.underline} But that asset --- the
intellectual capital and production capacity of aerospace and defense
manufacturing --- is at risk of atrophying to a point where it will not
be able to provide the weapons systems this country needs in the future.
[In aggregate, there are simply not enough viable modernization programs
and platforms --- in shipbuilding, manned aircraft, combat vehicles, and
more --- in or near production to meet the warfighter needs based on our
global national security strategy.]{.underline} Furthermore, in an era
of flattening and declining defense budgets, industry leaders receive
little useful guidance from the Pentagon that would allow them to best
target investments in people, facilities, and technology based on our
military's future needs. Continuing along this path portends several
risks:

[A growing number of corporations may shed their defense business
because their management will conclude that the growing risk and
declining returns associated with defense programs are fundamentally
incompatib]{.underline}le with their fiduciary responsibilities.

The [defense workforce will continue to erode as a generation of
technicians, engineers, and scientists retires and the dearth of new
programs makes it difficult to attract a new generation of
engineering]{.underline} and scientific talent. [Thousands of
high-skilled, middle-class jobs will be lost to an industry that is one
of the few manufacturing sectors left where the U.S. is globally
competitive.]{.underline}

Consequently[, [if a shift in the global security dynamic requires the
production of new weapons, industry would have a difficult time
reconstituting much of its skilled work force and production
capacity]{.underline}]{.mark}, with a potentially steep cost in time and
resources.

### 2NC DIB Internal Link- Hegemony/innovation 

#### DIB is key to hegemony -- allows rapid modernization to respond to threats

(CB)

[America's military must always be capable of going to war this very day
with capabilities on which warfighters can rely]{.underline}, with which
they have trained, and for which they have the necessary sustainment. At
the same time, the [[military needs to prepare for future
conflicts,]{.mark} to modernize, in anticipation of or in response to
changes in threats and technology]{.underline}, seeking capabilities
that will be needed in the event of future fights. Finally, [[the
military must ensure that there is sufficient resilience and
adaptability in the defense industrial base to respond to unanticipated
circumstances and emerging needs]{.mark}, particularly in
wartime.]{.underline}

[[Modernization is one of the four pillars on which U.S. military power
rests]{.underline}]{.mark}, along with force structure, readiness, and
sustainability. The goals of modernization are to close a capability
gap, provide a qualitatively improved capability, and/or reduce costs.
Modernization entails the replacement of an existing military
technology, generally a platform, weapon, or system, with one that is
significantly more capable, even transformational. Modernization is
about more than just hardware. To achieve a significant increase in
military effectiveness, the new item must be married to an appropriate
organization, concept of operations, set of tactics, command and control
system, and supporting infrastructure.

**Interagency Task Force September 2018** ( task force found to
investigate DIB, Assessing and Strengthening the Manufacturing and
Defense Industrial Base and Supply Chain Resiliency of the United
States)

[[The roots of America's defense industrial base are planted in the
broader manufacturing ecosystem]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Not only is [the
manufacturing sector the backbone of U.S. military technical advantage,
but also a major contributor to the U.S economy]{.mark}]{.underline},
accounting for 9% of employment, 12% of GDP, 60% of exports, 55% of
patents, and 70% of U.S. R&D.24 [The National Security Strategy
highlights the importance of a vibrant manufacturing sector to
comprehensive national power, while warning of the dangers inherent in
the weakening of America's manufacturing base: [A healthy defense
industrial base is a critical element of U.S. power and the National
Security Innovation Base]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The ability of the
military to surge in response to an emergency depends on our Nation's
ability to produce needed parts and systems, healthy and secure supply
chains, and a skilled U.S. workforce]{.underline}. [The erosion of
American manufacturing over the last two decades, however, has had a
negative impact on these capabilities and threatens to undermine the
ability of U.S. manufacturers to meet national security
requirements.]{.underline} Today, we rely on single domestic sources for
some products and foreign supply chains for others, and we face the
possibility of not being able to produce specialized components for the
military at home[. As America's manufacturing base has weakened, so too
have critical workforce skills ranging from industrial welding, to
high-technology skills for cybersecurity and aerospace. [Support for a
vibrant domestic manufacturing sector, a solid defense industrial base,
and resilient supply chains is a national
priority]{.mark}]{.underline}.25Between 2000 and 2010, over two-thirds
of U.S. manufacturing saw production declines in terms of
inflation-adjusted output.26 [While multi-factor productivity in
manufacturing grew on an average of 2% per year from 1992-2004,
productivity has declined an average of 0.3% per year from 2004 through
2016]{.underline}, implying diminishing economies of scale from inputs
including labor, capital equipment, energy, materials, and purchased
services.[27 Between 2000 and 2010 alone, the U.S. lost over 66,000
manufacturing facilities.28 While the U.S. has seen an uptick in
manufacturing, adding around 380,000 jobs since January 2017, 29 much
work remains to be done to remedy years of decline in the
sector.]{.underline} From 2000-2018, many defense-relevant sectors have
seen increased import penetration with rates more than doubling for the
industrial controls and machine tools subsectors.[30 Since 2010,
critical manufacturing and defense industrial base areas have seen
fluctuations in obligations spending, creating variability in vendor
counts and in many cases leading to lower domestic competition and
further deteriorating DoD's supply chain]{.underline} (Figure 11). [The
negative effects of sequestration and the budget caps shocked the market
and accelerated the downward trend in vendor counts, resulting in an
estimated 20% decline in the number of prime
vendors]{.underline}.[31Although America's traditional manufacturing
base still accounts for an outsized benefit to the economy, decreases in
key production capabilities, declines in manufacturing employment, and
slow output growth for many manufacturing sectors have created key
vulnerabilities and weaknesses that potentially threaten the nation's
defense-related manufacturing capabilities]{.underline}. [Since 1990,
small and medium sized businesses -- which make up a majority of U.S.
manufacturing and employ a large portion of workers in the sector --
reported declines in revenue growth]{.underline}, despite the largest
manufacturing firms posting more than 2% annual growth.32 [[The next
generation of weapons will require advanced software, artificial
intelligence, and machine learning, but traditional manufacturing
processes continues to build the systems, platforms, and munitions that
deliver kinetic effects. Both aspects of the industrial base are needed
for long term economic growth and national security.]{.mark} The decline
in the U.S. manufacturing industry, relative to prior periods of great
power, creates a variety of risks for America's manufacturing and
defense industrial base and, by extension, for DoD's ability to support
national defense. Risks range from greater reliance on single sources,
sole sources, and foreign providers to workforce gaps, product
insecurity, and loss of innovation.]{.underline}

**[[The administration's goal in streamlining the process for American
defense contractors to grow their sales internationally and bringing in
unmanned aerial systems is a race for global influence that goes well
beyond the marketplace]{.underline}]{.mark}**, government and industry
association panelists agreed on Wednesday. "Who's going to make the
rules for the next 50 years" for international behavior, Dak Hardwick,
assistant vice president for international affairs at the Aerospace
Industries Association, said. [Hardwick and others specially cited the
growing Chinese interest in overseas military sales and Russia's success
of selling air missile defense systems to Turkey and possibly India.
Neither has the strict rules governing the sales or how these systems
would be used after purchase the U.S. does.]{.underline} [Speaking at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies event in
Washington](https://www.csis.org/events/us-arms-transfer-policy), Tina
Kaidanow, acting assistant secretary of state for political-military
affairs, added the April presidential memo revising the arms transfer
policy and covering unmanned serial systems sales, "is only the first
step \[to\] support and grow our defense industrial base." She added
that every sale, still will be reviewed for compliance with United
States law concerning human rights and how each sale could affect arms
proliferation. [The government expects to meet industry requests to set
milestones and timelines so they can plan and budget for potential sales
domestically and to allies and partners,]{.underline} Laura Cressey,
deputy director for regional security and arms transfers at the State
Department said. She added [new financing options for foreign partners
would be available as an incentive to buy American]{.underline}. "We
have a bit of a balancing act here," she said. For example, the
balancing act includes mitigating the risk to the American warfighter
five years down the road by selling this specific system with its unique
technology to "Y" country. Case-by-case also means that approval is not
guaranteed based upon past performance by a contractor or behavior by a
nation, she and several panelists said. In some parts of the State
Department, it also means trying to "do more with less" to meet
accelerated timelines as staffing has been left vacant or cut, she
added. To Jeff Abramson, a senior fellow at the Arms Control
Association, this raised "a great deal of concern" because "priorities
are not being weighted" in reaching those decisions. He added arms sales
should not be considered "a trade commodity; these are weapons," not to
be rushed the system. Arms sales "are fundamentally a political act,"
Melissa Dalton, director of CSIS' cooperative defense project, added,
and the change in policy needs to fit in with the President Donald
Trump's national security strategy. In the memo, she said it uses that
standard as a guide but does not spell out how for the various federal
agencies involved in arms transfers. **["[What has changed" most in the
international marketplace "is the United States is not alone" in
offering quality military equipment,]{.mark}]{.underline}** Keith
Webster, president of the defense and aerospace export council at the
United States Chamber of Commerce, said. [He said the United States is
not only competing with the Russians and the Chinese, but also with its
allies such as the French, Koreans and Israelis]{.underline}. Thirty
years ago, "we had a very strong corner on the market," and only serious
competition from the Kremlin. Now the "consequence of denial" in a
potential arms transfer over American concerns about how the system will
be used or a nation's change in behavior, as was the case with Pakistan
when it pursued its nuclear weapons program, have much greater
consequences domestically. Likewise, [it becomes more complicated when a
potential partner, such as India, buys sophisticated aircraft from
France]{.underline}, as New Delhi did, and may do with an air defense
system from Russia. **[[Another goal in foreign arms sale is
interoperability]{.underline}]{.mark}** with American forces, Cressey
and Kaidanow said. When systems from other nations, even allies, are in
play, that becomes a further reach. As the policy unfolds, the panelists
from industry and [arms control associations stressed the importance of
keeping businesses and the public involved in as transparent a process
as possible.]{.underline} Alex Gray, a special White House assistant for
the defense industrial base, used the Farnborough air show this year in
the United Kingdom as an example of [the administration reaching out to
all levels of industry and allies and partners to talk over these
changes and what they can mean for them.]{.underline} "This is just the
beginning of our engagement," Cressey said, referring to follow-up
roundtables with industry, think tanks and associations. Hardwick, in
answer to a question, reminded all **[[it was important for State, who
gives the formal approval, and the Pentagon and Commerce, both also
involved in the sales program, to "remember the role of the end-user" in
all this. After all, it is an ally or partner looking to provide for its
security needs when examining different systems from a number of
countries.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

\"U.S. Arms Transfer Policy: Shaping the Way Ahead,\" No Publication,
https://www.csis.org/analysis/us-arms-transfer-policy-shaping-way-ahead//ALiang

And I think it's very timely. Obviously, change is afoot in the world of
U.S. arms transfers. You're seeing dramatic growth in the level -- [[the
dollar value of U.S. arms exports, and also changes in the world
market.]{.underline}]{.mark} So the focus of where exports are going is
shifting as demand around the world changes. [We're also seeing that our
arms exports and security cooperation more generally are a major focus
of the strategy, both in the National Security Strategy and in the
National Defense Strategy]{.underline}. And no doubt related to that
[there's a huge leadership focus on it]{.underline}. It's something that
we see the president of the United States personally engaging in and
addressing on a regular basis. It's something that has been a focus for
the secretary of defense. [And so it has a leadership focus that is
pretty unparalleled in the last year and a half.]{.underline} So there's
been a major new policy announced at the start of the year updating the
previous Conventional Arms Transfer Policy. And then we are just now on
the tail end of the implementation review for how to make that policy
practical in the way that the arms transfer process actually operates.
And I hope we'll hear about that in the remarks coming up. So, without
any further ado, I'm going to turn it over to Ambassador Kaidanow. And
after she's done, we'll bring the panel up and have the discussion. So
the floor is yours. AMBASSADOR TINA KAIDANOW: Great. Thanks. (Applause.)
Thank you very much, Andrew, for the very kind introduction. And thanks
to all of you this morning. It's a very good crowd for an August, my
God. And I love being introduced by sort of an emergency announcement. I
promise I won't cause the emergency -- (laughter) -- at least I hope not
-- but, no, I'm just kidding. And it's -- it really is a pleasure and
it's a privilege to be here today to talk about some of the issues that
we are talking about because arguably, as Andrew pointed out, this is
really front and center, both in terms of the president's agenda but
also, frankly, in terms of our work in the State Department and more
broadly throughout the U.S. government. So it is timely, and it is
something that I think is worthy of longer discussion. I will apologize
to you because after these remarks I am called off to a meeting at the
White House, but my colleague Laura Cressey, who is standing right here
in front of me -- or sitting -- she will be part of the panel, so we --
the State Department will be represented together with some other folks
that you've got, very illustrious folks that you've got, both from the
government as well as from industry. So, with no further ado, let me
just say I think, again, as Andrew mentioned and I know that most of you
are aware, in April of this past year the president issued a national
security policy memorandum announcing a revised conventional arms
transfer -- or, as we like to call it affectionately, a CAT -- policy.
The CAT Policy provides a framework under which the U.S. government and
all of its agencies will review and evaluate proposed arms transfers.
The new policy reflects the priorities of the president's National
Security Strategy, which are, namely, to preserve peace through strength
by reforming regulations to facilitate the exports of U.S. military
equipment; to strengthen partners and allies; to facilitate U.S.
economic security and innovation -- we'll talk a little bit more about
that; and to uphold respect for human rights and U.S. nonproliferation
objectives. In short, the new CAT Policy was designed to expand
opportunities for American industry, create American jobs, and maintain
U.S. national security, ensuring that we continue to review each arms
transfer thoroughly in order to ensure that it is in the national
interest of the United States. The release of the new policy was only
the first step in a series of what we believe will be very practical
results-focused initiatives to transform the way that [[the U.S.
government works to support and grow our defense industrial
base]{.mark}.]{.underline} Through that memorandum, the president also
directed the secretary of state, in coordination with the secretaries of
defense, commerce, and energy, to submit an implementation plan within
60 days. So, during the 60 days following the release of the policy, my
colleagues from across the executive branch and I met with stakeholders
from industry, from civil society, as well as congressional staffers to
collect all of their input and hopefully closely align our
implementation plan with real-world challenges. In fact, as part of this
engagement, in April I met with a group of scholars from the NGO and
think-tank community right here at CSIS to discuss the new CAT Policy.
We're very grateful for everybody who contributed feedback to that very
important process. And subsequently, as directed by the president's
national security policy memorandum, we did indeed submit a national
implementation plan on July 13 th. The plan represents an integrated
strategy, one that aligns our conventional arms transfers with our
national security and economic interests, and it's built on three
specific lines of effort. First, the plan calls for [prioritizing
strategic and economic competition through a paradigm shift from the
current reactive posture to a more proactive posture that actively
develops partnerships and capabilities reflective of U.S. strategic and
economic objectives]{.underline}. We will use this policy tool to ensure
that U.S. products can win in the competitive global marketplace.
Second, the plan envisions organizing our efforts for success, ensuring
that the executive branch is positioned, staffed, and resourced to best
support efficient execution of the Conventional Arms Transfer Policy,
and that its processes are also similarly constructed. Third, the [plan
calls for creating conducive environments through engagement with
Congress, industry, international partners, and other stakeholders to
foster the efficient operation of U.S. defense trade.]{.underline} What
all this really ultimately means and what the initiative makes clear is
that under [this administration there will be no more active advocate
for U.S. sales than the U.S. government itself. Thus, a [top priority of
my bureau -- the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs at the State
Department -- is maintaining the United States as the security partner
of choice for our many friends and allies overseas]{.mark}.]{.underline}
As just one example of this effort, not even a month ago really I
attended the Farnborough Airshow in the U.K., where I met with defense
industry representatives from U.S. companies of all sizes to discuss the
CAT Policy implementation plan and to seek feedback in real time. And
let me say, again, those companies were both small and medium, as well
as large. So we tried to hit on the array of companies that were
represented there, all of which were present. I also met with
counterparts from strategic partners and allies -- some from Europe,
other parts of the world -- to brief them on the president's new policy,
and to [[advocate strongly for ongoing and prospective defense
sales]{.mark}.]{.underline} For years, [U.S. embassies and consulates
have been committed to supporting U.S. companies' efforts to grow their
global exports]{.underline}. Our diplomats have long worked to ensure
that [[U.S. products and services have the best possible chance to
compete abroad]{.underline}]{.mark}. Through [participation in key forms
like Farnborough, the administration's defense-trade-focused initiatives
build upon this tradition of economic diplomacy and direct the U.S.
government to support America's defense industry by strengthening our
advocacy for defense sales that are obviously so critical to our
national interest]{.underline}.

#### DIB is key to national security -- solves WMD rogue states and terrorism 

**Navarro 18** (Peter Navarro is an assistant to the president and
director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy., 12-9-2018,
\"Why Economic Security Is National Security,\" Real Clear Politics,
https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2018/12/09/why_economic_security_is_national_security_138875.html//KDES).

[Today, we live in more complex times. Nation-states do not only
challenge us as strategic competitors. Rogue nations develop weapons of
mass destruction even as stateless actors engage in jihad and terrorism.
We are also in an intense economic competition with nations with whom we
trade freely -- yet our own free and fair trade often goes
unreciprocated.]{.underline}

[Into this breach comes President Donald J. Trump with a new organizing
principle for strategic policy: [Economic security is national
security.]{.mark}]{.underline}

To be economically secure, [American families must have good jobs at
good wages and the freedom to pursue the abundant economic and
entrepreneurial opportunities that were available to our forebears. Yet
such [economic security readily translates into national security
because it is only through an enduring American prosperity where we will
find the growth, resources, and technological innovations necessary to
field the most advanced military in the world.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Under the banner of "economic security is national security," the Trump
administration's corporate tax cuts now spur investment and catalyze
innovation. A wave of deregulation is making American businesses more
globally competitive. Steel and aluminum tariffs and strengthened "Buy
American" rules help bolster two key pillars of our defense industrial
base. Renegotiated trade deals with South Korea and the long-needed
NAFTA update -- the United States, Mexico, Canada agreement \-- will
soon help level the playing field for America's factory workers.

One of the purest expressions of "economic security is national
security" is the president's new conventional arms transfer policy. When
the U.S. government serves as an advocate for private industry to
increase defense sales, these sales strengthen our strategic partners
and help stabilize regional alliances. That's pure national security.

But the Trump administration's new defense sales policies also create
great jobs at great wages. That's pure economic security.

Consider the sale of F-16 fight jets to Bahrain. It not only created
more jobs at a new facility in Greenville, S.C., its benefits are
rippling across more than 450 manufacturers and suppliers dispersed
across 42 states.

No one understands better than the president that it is within these
sub-tiers of our supply chain where some of our best manufacturing jobs
are \-- and where some of America's greatest vulnerabilities may exist.
On July 21, 2017, he directed the secretary of defense to lead a
historic whole-of-government assessment of America's defense industrial
base.

["[A healthy defense industrial base is a critical element of U.S.
power]{.mark},"]{.underline} the president proclaimed in the 2017
National Security Strategy. [[The "ability of the military to surge in
response to an emergency depends on our Nation's ability to produce
needed parts and systems."]{.underline}]{.mark}

On October 5, Deputy Secretary of Defense Pat Shanahan presented to the
White House the results of DoD's defense industrial base assessment.
This report identified almost 300 gaps and vulnerabilities that this
administration is already taking swift actions to address.

For example, we face numerous so-called "single points of failure" where
we have only one source of production \-- shafts for our ships, gun
turrets for our tanks, space-based infrared detectors for missile
defense, fabric for the lowly but increasingly high-tech tent. Our
defense industrial base is also far too dependent on foreign suppliers
for printed circuit boards, machine tools, and many other items critical
to national security.

[One key lesson from the Defense Department assessment is "never again."
Never again should we allow budget sequestration to suck the oxygen --
and capacity to innovate \-- out of America's defense industrial
base.]{.underline}

One key warning is that America's "manufacturing global competitiveness"
has been "diminished" not just by the "collateral damage of
globalization \[but\] also due to specific targeting" by strategic
competitors like China.

In his Section 301 investigation and supplementary report, the United
States trade representative has meticulously documented the full range
of acts, policies, and practices China has employed in its attempts to
acquire America's technological crown jewels \-- from "forced technology
transfer" and "systematic investment" aimed at "cutting edge
technologies" to "cyber-enabled theft."

As Vice President Mike Pence has warned regarding these national
security implications, the Chinese Communist Party, using "stolen
technology," is "turning plowshares into swords on a massive scale."

Viewed from this bridge, the Section 301 tariffs the Trump
administration has imposed to defend our technological crown jewels can
contribute to our arsenal of democracy alongside the Abrams tank, the
Arleigh Burke class destroyer, and the Tomahawk missile.

As President Trump has eloquently stated: ["[Economic vitality, growth,
and prosperity at home \[are\] absolutely necessary for American power
and influence abroad. Any nation that trades away its prosperity for
security will end up losing both]{.mark}]{.underline}[."]{.mark}

That's why under the banner of "economic security is national security,"
the nation's tax, regulatory, energy, and trade policies now fit
seamlessly with this administration's increased defense spending,
liberalized arms sales, and broader defense policies. Because of such
strong strategic leadership from President Trump, America is a far safer
and more prosperous nation.

industrial]{.mark} and manufacturing workforce.]{.underline} Over six
decades, various [[U.S. defense strategies have emphasized the benefits
of a technologically superior military]{.mark} to help deter and win

life on the battlefield]{.underline}. [The ability to maintain
America\'s military technological edge reflects the superior efficiency
of America\'s defense industry.]{.underline} America\'s
capital-intensive Air Force and Navy operate the world\'s best fighter
aircraft, long-range bombers, aircraft carriers, destroyers, cruisers,
and submarines. Similarly, [the Army is building a host of
next-generation platforms, including tanks and attack helicopters, that
will allow it to complete its missions.]{.underline} This is also the
case in platform systems and areas such as low-observable and

munitions.[\[2\]](https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/maintaining-the-superiority-americas-defense-industrial-base#_ftn2)
[technology alone has not assured American military superiority, [the
defense industry has nevertheless been a potent enabler of American
military might]{.mark}. The base of this power can be found in a series
of core capabilities that the U.S. has been able to maintain and
continue to modernize over recent decades. These include, among others,
air dominance, strategic lift, the ability to project power throughout

### 2NC DIB Internal Link- Innovation 

#### Key to innovation

**Dombrowski and Gholz 06** By Peter J. Dombrowski, Eugene Gholz - 2006
Buying Military Transformation: Technological Innovation and the Defense
Industry //ALiang

[[National Systems of Innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}? The growth of
globalization-Americanization in the defense industry has yet to be
given adequate consideration in that stream of literature which draws on
the concept of National Systems of Innovation (NSI) (Nelson 1993;
Lundvall 1992[). [The defense industry has often been cited as the key
instance of NSIs]{.underline}]{.mark}. Chenais (1993) in France and
Walker (1993[) in Britain, for example, have identified the defense
sector as a key---if not the primary---channel through which national
research and development resources impact upon national industrial and
economic performance]{.underline} (see also Gummett and Stein 1994). 19
The NSI literature brings together in a new paradigm a number of
observations that have long been familiar in the defense field. It is
useful in that [it focuses attention on the relations between
publicly-provided or underwritten capacities and the defense sector in a
comparative perspective]{.underline}. However, the globalization
tendencies noted above suggest that the NSI approach is severely limited
in that---at least to date---it lack an adequate historical dimension.
[The changes associated with Globalization-Americanization in defense
suggest that the defense sector is in general ceasing to be such a
straightforward exemplar of a National System of
Innovation]{.underline}. Put another way, they show that the NSI must be
seen as historically as well as geographically specific. The other side
of the coin of Globalization-[[Americanization in defense is that the
relationship between the defense sector and national science and
technology investment is changing.]{.mark} In short, defense is ceasing
to be a major window through which national innovatory capacities are
projected into the national economy in those states that increasingly
pattern their militaries on American technology]{.underline}. I suggest
that this is [the predictable consequence of the privatization of the
defense industry that accompanies "Actually Existing Globalization." In
Europe---where since 1997 governments and industry have been discussing
ways to form a cross-border defense giant as the next convulsive phase
of restructuring---the benefits spilling over from the defense sector to
other industries, firms, and employees within the nations are shrinking.
Subcontracting linkages are becoming closer, and the number of firms
involved is declining, but this does not follow a national (much less a
regional) pattern]{.underline}. In sum, the net benefits of national
inputs of skills, public resources, etc. to defense are being channelled
more exclusively into the private (corporate) networks outlined above.
The Dilemmas of National R&D Support to an Increasingly Globalized
Industry [T[he "globalization" of defense-related R&D and production in
Europe poses new problems for the formal agencies of national
innovation,]{.mark} most prominently the defense research
establishments]{.underline}. These problems have been particularly acute
and visible in the United Kingdom, where the Defense Evaluation and
Research Agency (DERA) has been in a state of near crisis for some
years. The root cause of the dilemma is simple: [the agency used to
provide public-funded inputs at no or minimal cost to the users on the
rationale of promoting the national defense industrial base. Its mission
was revised in the mid-1990s to become "providing the MOD (Ministry of
Defense) with expert information to assist in procurement on the global
level."]{.underline} On the one hand, it is unable to access 20 1 For
example, see Braczyk, Cooke, and Heidenreich (1998). Two of the authors
are European bureaucrats, while the third is an academic who has worked
closely with the Commission, and with regional agencies. [lavish public
funds to pursue the kind of "blue skies" research in which it engaged in
the past (resulting in some important technological gains, such as
vertical take-off and landing aircraft and infra-red technology, which
were then transferred to British companies and remain vital to their
profitability and competitive footholds)]{.underline}. The decline of
public funding for DERA has been a cause célèbre in the British defense
industry, which although now privatized, still wants to be able to draw
upon R&D inputs provided by the public sector. In 1995 the effects of
the rundown were such that it was claimed that necessary defense
aerospace R&D was making unsustainable demands on companies, which were
spending 130 percent of their profits on R&D (OST 1995; Lovering 1995).
Defense R&D fell four times as rapidly as civilian R&D did. [[The new
Labour government has begun to address this problem, with the Strategic
Defense Review of 1998 promising more public spending on demonstrator
programs guided by the companies. Meanwhile, the proportion of R&D in
the British defense industry accounted for by "overseas" resources
continues to rise]{.mark}.]{.underline} For DERA to fulfil its mission
of providing expert advise to the MOD, it needs to adopt an impartial
posture. But, as its spokespersons have pointed out, they are
increasingly dependent on the companies themselves for the requisite
technical expertise. Public defense research, in short, is increasingly
bound up with the construction of "specialist knowledge" in which
private interests are increasingly dominant actors. Globalization,
together with neo-liberal public policies, have created an almost
insuperable dilemma for the official repositories of the public
interest. From National to Regional Systems of Innovation? It is worth
noting here that the restructuring of defense shows tendencies that run
precisely counter to those that many economic geographers claim to have
identified as the emergent paradigm of economic geography---namely the
economic empowerment of "regions" (Storper 1995; Scott 1998). A new
sub-theme in this literature---at least in Europe---is the historical
and normative claim that competitiveness is related less to the
existence of national than of regional systems of innovation (the term
"region" is not defined with any clarity). This idea is popular in
Europe in those political, administrative and academic circles most
closely associated with the regional policy activities of the European
union.1 21 However, the regionalized versions of the NSI literature is
much less substantial than its National elder brother. Indeed it relies
on assertion, generalization from abstract propositions, and extremely
loose empirical work. It shares many of these weaknesses with the wider
new literature on "Regional Resurgence," which is coming under
increasingly critical scrutiny (see Lovering 1999b). There is virtually
no empirical content to the claims of the RSI writers. Insofar as there
is any evidence of the regional flows of R&D within the United Kingdom,
for example, it suggests that there exist several "islands of
innovation" in UK aerospace that are as closely embedded in networks
stretching overseas as in networks indigenous to the United Kingdom
(Hickie 1991). Similarly, such evidence as is available on R&D
connections within the United Kingdom shows a national rather than a
regional pattern (Goddard et al. 1994). In short, the notion of the RSI,
at least in Britain, is best described as not very accurate. The
"globalization" of the defense sector would seem to be living proof that
if they exist at all, regional systems of innovation have little
influence on the leading edge of modern high-technology industry. The
impact of "globalization" on the geography of the European defense
industry would seem to be clear in general terms: the consolidation of
high-level activities within a shrinking number of existing established
locations (such as Warton, Lancaster---military aircraft; Munich,
Bavaria---military aircraft; Hengelo, Netherlands---naval electronics;
Cherbourg, France--- naval ships), alongside a radical decline of
employment in lower-tier companies and in labor-intensive production and
assembly activities. A sign of the future in this context is British
Aerospace's recent agreement with PZL Mielec of Poland to make parts of
Hawk airframe, parts that at present are made at Hull and at Hamble.
While some high-level professional jobs remain in Western Europe, and
others decline, the companies are also engaged in proliferating small
"buy-local" initiatives that help to sustain their local image and
legitimacy as key employers and important actors in the new regional
structures of economic governance, especially in the labor market (e.g.,
BAe Warton). The real action, however, is elsewhere, as a result of
increasing de facto corporate and labor market integration linking sites
and elite labor forces in British and other European towns to their
collaborators and intended customers in St Louis or Seattle. BAe has
long had most of its software provided by wire from India. The search
for wider markets and lower labor costs is leading to the rapid
establishment of new outposts in Capetown, Beijing, and elsewhere. In
short, the phrase "globalizationlocalization" in the defense sector
entails very different effects under each of its terms. 22 Conclusion:
Defense Globalization versus States and Their Regions We are faced with
a curious paradox. The defense sector is "de-nationalizing"---and even
more radically "de-localizing"---just at the time when governments are
emphasizing the need to promote national competitiveness, and are
stressing the role of policies and networks at the regional scale to
achieve this. Spokespersons for government departments and industry and
many academics are claiming that a new "regionalization" of economic
activity, including innovation, is the key process in the world economy,
and the appropriate focus of policy. The thrust of this chapter is
that---at least in the defense sector---this influential academic and
policy discourse is, in a nutshell, wrong (see also Lovering 1998a). In
order to understand the defense sector, and its relationship to
innovation, we need to add both a new "political" dimension to the
globalization approach, and a new historical dimension to the National
Systems of Innovation perspective. The combined effect would be see the
transformation of defense in a new light. From the point of view of the
impact of current changes on national (and regional) economic
development and employment, and equally from the point of view of a
Peace Studies focus on the public control of the technologies of
violence, the result will not be very cheering.

[[America\'s military strength remains vital to preserving the nation\'s
interests and sustaining international stability]{.underline}]{.mark}.
While [[much of this strength is derived from]{.mark} the
professionalism and skills of America\'s armed forces, [the
technologically superior military platforms]{.mark}]{.underline} that
the U.S. has developed and fielded since World War II are also [vital to
ensuring a superior fighting force]{.underline}. In both peace and war[,
[America\'s defense manufacturing industrial base has allowed the United
States to design and build an advanced array of weapons
systems]{.underline}]{.mark} [and platforms to meet the full spectrum of
potential missions]{.underline} the military may be called upon to
fulfill. [[Securing America\'s military dominance for the decades ahead
will require: An industrial base that can retain a highly skilled
workforce with critical skill]{.mark} sets and Sustained investment in
platforms that offer future commanders and civilian leaders a vital set
of core military capabilities and equipment to respond to any
threat.]{.underline} America\'s military may also benefit from a more
open international defense market. A 2005 Heritage Foundation study
examined the [effect of globalization on the defense market and
concluded that access to foreign suppliers would play a significant and
positive role in helping the Pentagon to access a broader industrial
base and meet immediate defense needs more
efficiently.]{.underline}[[\[1\]]{.underline}](https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/maintaining-the-superiority-americas-defense-industrial-base#_ftn1)
These findings still hold true today. While remaining focused on the
[critical technologies, industries, and skills that are not readily
available in the global market, Congress should also support increased
foreign military sales to help complement America\'s domestic defense
industrial base.]{.underline} Following the sweeping procurement changes
proposed by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates in President Barack
Obama\'s fiscal year (FY) 2010 defense budget, the decisions awaiting
congressional review will directly affect America\'s defense industrial
base for years to come. These funding decisions about what the military
will and will not buy are a primary factor in determining whether
America will retain its military primacy a decade from now. The critical
workforce ingredients in sustaining an industrial base capable of
[[building next-generation systems are specialized design]{.underline},
[engineering, and manufacturing
skills]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} The consolidation of the
defense industry during the 1990s has placed an increased burden on a
small collection of defense companies, and the consolidation of major
defense contractors has led to a general reduction in the number of
available workers. Already at a turning point, [the potential closure of
major defense manufacturing lines in the next five years with no
additional scheduled production could shrink this national asset even
further.]{.underline} While the manufacturing workforce alone should not
dictate congressional defense acquisition decisions, the potential
defense \"brain drain\" must be considered when Congress determines
whether or not to permanently shut down major production
lines\--particularly shipbuilding and aerospace. More often than not,
once these highly skilled workers exit the federal workforce, they are
difficult to recruit back and more expensive to retrain with significant
project gaps. Given the inherently unpredictable nature of the
international security system, Congress must take a long-term
perspective for defense planning. More specifically, [[Congress should
closely examine the national security implications of the pending
closure of several major production lines]{.mark}, including the F-22
Raptor, C-17 Globemaster III, F/A-18E/F, F-15E Strike Eagle, High
Mobility Artillery Rocket System, Airborne Laser, and various
rotary-wing programs when crafting the annual defense bills for FY
2010.]{.underline}

THE GOOD AND BAD OF TODAY'S AMERICAN ECONOMY AND THE UNDERPINNINGS TO
THE NATION'S DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR

[[The defense]{.underline}]{.mark} and broader aerospace and [national
security [industrial base is often thought of as the "arsenal of
democracy]{.mark}"]{.underline} going back to the term first coined by
FDR during World War II. And in this role, [it has certainly played its
part in defending America, from the]{.underline} astounding 324,000
[aircraft and]{.underline} 88,000 [tanks manufactured by]{.underline}
the [U.S. firms]{.underline} during World War II (amazing numbers to
think about given today's D.C. debates over whether to buy 172 F-22s or
500 EFVs or not) to the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles
and Reaper drones that our servicemen and women use today in
Afghanistan.

Historically, **[[the vitality of the base has been wrapped up within
the state of American military excellence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This
may not have been true in Revolutionary War times, when the colonists
helped create a form of guerrilla warfare and depended far more on
classic insurgent methods than on military might of the classic sort.
But it has been largely true ever since, culminating in the
[[**victories of** the world **wars**]{.mark} as well as the nonviolent
triumph over the Warsaw Pact in the Cold War that [was **due largely to
the nation's strong**]{.mark}]{.underline} economy and high technology
prowess in **[[defense]{.underline}]{.mark}** as well as nondefense
[[realms]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Today those traditional strengths are at risk, and this is all the more
concerning given the complex future we face. In a period during which
China is rising, extremism and terrorism are thriving, American
manufacturing is declining, and technology is evolving at a fast pace,
the planning frameworks for American defense policy are much harder to
establish.

At the level of grand strategy, [the United States retains many
impressive strengths. It is still the world's top economic
power]{.underline}, with more than 20 percent of global GDP even
according to purchasing power parity calculations, and 25 percent
according to classic exchange-rate calculations.1 Those who compare this
data to the 50 percent share of global output that the United States
accounted for after World War II as evidence of U.S. decline forget that
the postwar period was highly unusual because so many other powers had
been so (temporarily) weakened by war. In fact, [it was largely U.S.
grand strategy that led to the rapid recovery of western European
democracies as well as Japan]{.underline}, to say nothing of the rise of
new economic powerhouses like South Korea and Taiwan, in the ensuing
decades. We helped them recover and grow on purpose. Thus, the decline
in U.S. GDP as a percentage of the global total should arguably be seen
more as a success of American strategy than a weakness or failing. The
international institutions that Washington led the way in creating, the
foreign aid it provided, and the alliance system it forged made possible
economic trends that have generally worked to the U.S. advantage.2

As a further benefit of the success of this strategy, most key nations
around the world viewed the United States as either friendly or benign.
That remains true, even in eras where American popularity declines. As
of today, the United States leads a global alliance system of more than
60 partner states that collectively account for almost 80 percent of
global GDP and more than 80 percent of total global military spending
between them.3

It should be noted therefore that the [[defense industrial
bases]{.mark}]{.underline} of these other states
[[may]{.underline}]{.mark} [also [be thought of as part of our overall
global security structure]{.underline}]{.mark}. That system includes the
NATO alliance, the system of bilateral alliances in East Asia and the
Western Pacific, the Rio Pact in Latin America at least at a formal
level, and (less formally but quite significantly) American security
partnerships with Taiwan, Israel, the Gulf Cooperation Council, and Iraq
and Afghanistan. Arguably even Pakistan and India are best seen as part
of this system rather than outside of it; at worst they are neutrals.
Among the world's major nations, only China and Russia are essentially
outside this somewhat informal but still quite significant network. And
America's actual open nemeses as well as potential adversaries---Iran,
North Korea, perhaps Venezuela, Syria and Burma and one or two other
such countries---collectively account for 1 to 2 percent of global
economic output or military power.

Since World War II, [[the United States' military strategy has
emphasized exploiting technological superiority to deter war]{.mark},
win conflicts, and shape the behavior of other nations, allies as well
as adversaries, during peacetime]{.underline}. Against this criterion,
**[[the defense industry has to be given high marks for its
contributions to national defense]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Of course,
[the United States had the resources]{.underline} to pursue a strategy
that sought, as much as possible, [to substitute technology and
equipment for the blood of its warriors.]{.underline} Since the 1940s,
the United States has outspent all other nations with the exception of
the Soviet Union from 1970 until the early 1980s. Since the Cold War
ended, the US military has been able to outspend all actual or
prospective rivals by even wider margins, although this fact must be
balanced against its greater commitments.

Significant portions of the US military have been engaged in combat
operations more or less continuously since 1991.

Granting these caveats[, the United States has nonetheless outdone other
nations in the development of superior systems in most important arenas
of military competition.]{.underline} Today, [US nuclear submarines,
surface combatants, tactical combat aircraft, bombers, main battle
tanks, reconnaissance satellites and navigation satellites are the
leaders in their respective classes.]{.underline} In underlying areas
such as low-observables technologies, submarine quieting, acoustic
detection, digital signal processing for a range of applications, active
electronically scanned arrays, near-real-time sensor-to- shooter
targeting connectivity, and all-weather guided munitions, [**[the
defense industry has given the US military substantial leads, many of
which have been sustained over periods of
decades.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### Defense industry innovation solves WMD threats 

**Weber 15** (Andy Weber, July/August 2015, \"Innovation in Countering
Weapons of Mass Destruction,\" No Publication,
https://www.armscontrol.org/ACT/2015_0708/Features/Innovation-in-Countering-Weapons-of-Mass-Destruction//KDES).

[In April, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter traveled to Silicon Valley to
meet with technology industry leaders and signal his intent to lead the
Department of Defense in the direction of greater innovation. Although
his visit focused heavily on cybersecurity, it is critical to apply his
vision to the task of preventing and preparing for crises involving
weapons of mass destruction (WMD).]{.underline} As these threats can
evolve quickly, testing the United States' ability to adapt, a broad
understanding of how to apply technological solutions is crucial.
[Investments by the U.S. government and its international partners often
focus too narrowly on invention of entirely new tools and systems. In
many cases, governments do not need to invent new, "game-changing"
technologies in order for technology to change the game. Effectively
countering WMD threats requires not just invention, but true innovation
as Carter described it, including applying existing technologies in new
ways, changing processes to gain efficiencies, and finding creative
applications for tools that are already available.]{.underline} There
are many cases in which rapid and creative use of existing and often
low-tech capabilities is the fastest option for altering the trajectory
of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons threats. The challenge of
destroying the declared stockpile of Syrian chemical weapons proved that
one of the best ways to address modern WMD threats can be simply to help
an organization to rapidly use existing technologies in new ways. [This
article will explore such an approach to countering WMD threats and
describe how focusing more attention on innovation, especially by taking
advantage of existing technologies in novel ways to rapidly prevent
proliferation or use of nonconventional weapons and dual-use
technologies, would be cost effective and improve the ability of the
United States and other countries to respond with speed as threats
evolve.]{.underline} Furthermore, this approach is crucial to
democratizing the process of countering proliferation threats by
ensuring that lower-income countries can contribute to efforts to
counter WMD threats and by expanding opportunities for the private
sector and individual citizens to help mitigate nuclear, biological, and
chemical weapons dangers. The Element of Time It often seems that WMD
threats are relics of past eras---ancient methods kept alive as the
character of warfare modernizes. The world recently marked the 100th
anniversary of modern battlefield use of chemical weapons. Use of
biological means to defeat or subjugate adversaries goes back hundreds
of years, possibly to ancient times. Nuclear threats are frequently
described as a threat of the Cold War era more than a current challenge.
In fact, [the threats from these nonconventional weapons pose some of
the greatest contemporary security challenges, in part because they are
often characterized by rapid evolution and a tendency to increase in
urgency with little warning time.]{.underline} The United States and its
partners have many important baseline tools to counter WMD threats.
Treaty negotiations, export control systems, arms control efforts, and
long-term research and development initiatives form an important
foundation for preventing proliferation and use of nonconventional
weapons. Yet, [the ability to act quickly as new threats emerge---often
in weeks or months, not years---is critical but underappreciated.
Innovation is often the best path to success.]{.underline} Success With
Syrian Chemicals A unit of the Field Deployable Hydrolysis System is

docked at Portsmouth, Virginia, on January 2, 2014. (DOD photo by C.
Todd Lopez)[The Defense Department's contribution to the destruction of
Syria's chemical weapons stands as a textbook example of the role rapid
innovation can play in mitigating WMD threats. The stockpile of chemical
weapons materials that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad declared to the
international community in his quest for regime survival included
mustard agent, ingredients to formulate sarin and VX agents, and smaller
quantities of other substances used in the country's chemical weapons
program]{.underline}. The Assad regime stored most of the chemicals in
bulk liquid form in hundreds of barrels and tanks rather than filled
weapons that were ready for use. The chemicals were dispersed at sites
around the country as it descended into a protracted and brutal civil
war. In late 2012, [Pentagon scientists and engineers were asked to
envision how any country, given the opportunity, would go about
destroying chemicals like those then held by the Assad
regime]{.underline}. Many chemical weapons ingredients can be destroyed
in incinerators, but others are better or more quickly destroyed using
an initial hydrolysis process to alter the chemicals into substances
that incinerators can more easily handle without damage. The most
dangerous 600 metric tons of Syria's 1,300 metric tons of chemical
weapons materials fell into the latter category. Most facilities that
conduct chemical weapons destruction operations are large, expensive,
and built for a specific location. Removing Syria's chemicals to one of
these facilities most likely would have been impossible in the face of
international legal questions and political and logistical constraints.
Yet, no country in the world had an easily transportable technology that
could rapidly destroy large quantities of bulk liquid chemical weapons
materials. With no desire by the United States or others to construct a
fixed facility in the middle of Syria's civil war, [the Defense
Department's top WMD destruction experts were formally tasked in January
2013 with developing a hydrolysis system that could be transported to
any location in the world where destruction operations could be
conducted safely.]{.underline} Within six months, the first unit stood
in a containment tent in the summer sun at Aberdeen Proving Ground in
Maryland. Looking at the Field Deployable Hydrolysis System (FDHS), as
its creators named it, one sees a maze of pipes, pumps, tanks, and hoses
fixed within two standard shipping containers. When fully assembled on
land, several additional shipping containers were arrayed around the
FDHS to heat water, analyze the chemicals that are pumped through the
system, and perform other standard support functions. Through the summer
of 2013, it was not known where or when the systems, which could be
assembled for use within 10 days, might be used. The Defense Department
requested that seven units be developed in order to maximize its
options. For example, the department was able to consider sending a few
of the seven units to locations in or near the Middle East to be quickly
assembled in case the Assad regime's loss of territory led to small
batches of dangerous chemicals becoming available for the international
community to destroy. [In order to have equipment available within six
months, department experts drew on the technical knowledge they already
had, modified commercially purchased items, and used some equipment
already in the Pentagon's inventory. With extensive chemical weapons
demilitarization experience informing their work, the department's
engineers, chemists, and managers adapted proven chemical neutralization
capabilities to rapidly develop a novel solution.]{.underline} The FDHS
solution was elegant and straightforward. Perhaps more importantly, it
was developed quickly enough to influence an increasingly urgent
challenge. It made it possible for the United States to convince the
world that physical removal of chemical materials for destruction
outside Syria was feasible and desirable. **[Innovation quickly created
new options for successfully countering one of the world's most pressing
WMD threats.]{.underline}**

### 2NC DIB Impacts- Conflict response

#### Global conflicts are coming now -- only a strong DIB allows us to respond 

**Hendrix 17** (Jerry Hendrix, naval expert at the Center for a New
American Security. 7-26-2017, \"Trump Acts To Revitalize America's
Defense Industrial Base,\" Breaking Defense,
https://breakingdefense.com/2017/07/trump-acts-to-revitalize-americas-defense-industrial-base//KDES).

[President Donald Trump has identified a fact few of his recent
predecessors have understood: the Defense Industrial Base of the United
States (DIB) is a critical component of our national
security.]{.underline} The DIB is more important than any individual
weapons program -- be it an aircraft carrier, long range bomber, or
high-tech tank. But for too long, [the DIB has been ignored, mismanaged
or even attacked.]{.underline}

[With his signing of an executive order to review and revitalize
America's industrial base, the president has taken the first step to
rebuilding the nation's defense infrastructure. This will also encourage
the restoration of redundancies in our industrial capability that are
crucial both in peace time and in times of war.]{.underline} Like Ronald
Reagan, President Trump also understands that DIB jobs are high-paying
and give skilled workers in regions that have suffered from economic
neglect a chance to get back to work in our factories and shipyards.

That he chose to sign the executive order on the USS Gerald Ford
aircraft carrier Friday carries real symbolism. [Only America has the
capacity to build a super carrier. The Russians want such ships but
cannot construct them and even the Chinese, with all of their
recently-acquired shipbuilding prowess, are years away from replicating
the Ford-class carriers that will soon enter America's fleet. But this
technological and manufacturing edge can no longer be taken for granted
as the nation's DIB becomes increasingly fragile.]{.underline}

With his focus on the DIB, Trump now follows in the footsteps of both
Roosevelt's, Theodore and Franklin. Each President Roosevelt served as
the assistant secretary of the Navy, managing the rapid expansion of the
US Navy prior to the Spanish-American War (Theodore) and World War I
(Franklin). These experiences dramatically informed their understanding
of the DIB during their presidencies. For Theodore Roosevelt, it was the
"up-building" of the Great White Fleet that heralded the United States'
emergence as a world power at the dawn of the twentieth century. His
cousin, Franklin, was required to shift the entire American economy to
war footing, altering Detroit assembly lines from automobiles to bombers
while building warships on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. That
incredible output turned the tide of the war and defeated the Axis.

As the Cold War moved into full-swing, five star
general-turned-president Dwight Eisenhower's launched the Solarium
project. The wise men of Solarium reviewed the entire breadth and depth
of the American economy, identifying the areas to be strengthen if the
United States was to win its competition with the Soviet Union. Not
surprisingly, much of the focus of the project was on America's DIB. The
Trump White House's National trade Council its Industrial policy shop
has come to the same conclusion today that the Solarium scholars did in
the 1950s.

Like the Roosevelts, Eisenhower and Reagan before him, President [Trump
has inherited a world in crisis. A resurgent and aggressive Russia, a
rising and assertive China, an Iran intent on establishing a Middle East
hegemony and a nuclear-crazed rogue-state North Korea all are
undermining the free market and rules-based international order that
America has encouraged and protected for decades. In light of these
challenges, a vibrant United States DIB is an imperative today just as
it has been in past eras.]{.underline}

[Trump's executive order is necessary to address a generation of neglect
of the DIB]{.underline} that followed the West's victory in the Cold
War. Dramatic contractions in defense spending, especially the Obama
Administration's sequestration program that it exacted from Congress in
exchange for reopening the government, waves of industrial mergers and
defense contractor consolidations and naïve strategic assumptions
regarding the "end of history" have left the America's DIB fragile and
lacking in redundant capability. Trump's executive order requires the
government undertake a thorough inventory of the breadth and depth of
the nation's DIB so the administration can identify where it is thin and
requires strengthening.

Unfortunately, many policy makers's understanding of the DIB begins and
ends with seeing ships, planes and tanks rolling off the factory
assembly line. While impressive, the port, tarmac or tank parking lot
give a very limited view of the DIB. What is not seen are the thousands
of individual part and component manufacturers who supply the nation's
big defense factories. A missile assembly line in St. Louis may employ
500 people, but there are likely to be over a 1,000 workers, spread
across the country, manufacturing the various parts that combine to
produce just one of the missiles that ultimately rolls of the line.

Often, there are many suppliers of ubiquitous nuts, bolts and screws
that go into a weapon, which is how it should be. In other cases,
however, there is merely one supplier in the entire country of a key
widget or component upon which an important weapon's platform depends.
It is well-known, for example in defense circles that critical items
such as five-axis tooling machines or circuit boards, are in very short
supply. Consequently, the DIB, like the nation's overall economy, has
come to depend on foreign manufacturers, including some that are
China-based, for important defense components. Few questions are being
asked in Washington how the nation might gain access to these foreign
components in a time of war.

The narrowing of the country's DIB is not just limited to subcontractors
and suppliers. It has affected America's great companies as well, many
of which no longer exist. In the past, the United States boasted 10
major military aircraft manufacturers. Today we have four. During World
War II, we had over 50 shipyard dry docks capable of producing warships
over 400 feet in length, some of them on the Ohio and Mississippi
rivers. Today we have 12. Even among the dozen, several are under
economic strain. America is down to one tank factory and it only
produces a handful of tanks per year and exists only at the insistence
of Congress, which has fought to keep it open.

The DIB is not just the sum of components, platforms, contractors and
factories. It is also composed of the hundreds of thousands of welders,
electricians, pipefitters, metal workers, heating and air conditioning
specialists, tool makers, composite material molders, engineers,
scientists, logistics specialists, test pilots and managers who actually
invent and build our weapons systems[. All of these jobs, and many more,
skilled blue collar and while collar positions alike, are
critical]{.underline} to the our country. [They are solid, stable
occupations that enhance our nation's defense while also providing
comfortable middle and upper income livings for the men and women
engaged in them. Yet these jobs have disappeared at an alarming rate as
the DIB has shrunk]{.underline}. Once the critical skills they embody
are lost, it is very difficult to reconstitute them within the
workforce. Thus, America's current and future skilled defense industry
work force should also benefit from the President's executive order.

We recognize that in today's economy, with its global supply chains and
"just-in-time deliveries", redundancy signifies inefficiency and waste.
We are free marketeers and agree that the DIB should operate as
efficiently as possible, but we reject the idea that all redundancies
should be wrung out of the base or that we should be content to rely on
foreign competitors for our national security.

It was not too long ago, at the height of the Cold War, that our
national leadership was concerned about where important elements of our
national defense could be produced if Soviet or Chinese nuclear strikes
destroyed our major centers of manufacturing. Given the range of threats
today, from asymmetric strikes and terrorism from Iran, North Korea or
non-state actors to a peer competitor conflict with Russia or China, it
is time again to care about a level of redundancy in the physical plants
of our DIB.

Similarly, [we do not have the luxury of simply assuming continued
access to key foreign components in a time of crisis or war a time of
war. For example long-range missiles are built with components that
contain rare earth minerals that currently are only mined in China. In a
crisis or conflict with China, such materials would no doubt be cutoff.
Many key rare earth minerals are found and could be mined in the
American West on a relatively cost-efficient basis but they are not for
lack of encouragement from the federal government and industry, which
has become complacent in its reliance on China.]{.underline}

[We expect that President Trump's executive order with lead to a true
revitalization of America's defense industrial base -- both its physical
plant and its skilled workforce. We believe that it will likely lead to
the requisite level of redundancy returning to the defense sector. As a
result, America will gain strength, which will go a long way to ensuring
the peace during this time of crisis and uncertainty in the
world]{.underline}. We applaud the President and his team for taking
this important step as he joins an elite club of past presidents who had
a similar vision.

### 2NC DIB Terminal impact -- competitiveness

#### U.S. competitiveness preserves American influence and generates cooperation on a host of issues. 

**Colby and Lettow 14** -- Elbridge Colby is the Robert M. Gates fellow
at the Center for a New American Security. Paul Lettow was senior
director for strategic planning on the U.S. National Security Council
staff from 2007 to 2009 (Have We Hit Peak America?
<http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/07/03/have-we-hit-peak-america/>, Foreign
Policy)

[American leadership in the world is imperiled. And at a fundamental
level. The American people sense it. A number of recent polls show that
more Americans than ever before -- nearly 60 percent, in some cases --
believe U.S. power is waning.]{.underline}

In other words, [a greater number of Americans are worried about
diminishing U.S. influence today than in the face of feared Soviet
technological superiority in the late 1950s, the Vietnam quagmire of the
late 1960s, the 1973 oil embargo, the apparent resurgence of Soviet
power around the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan, and the economic concerns
that plagued the late 1980s---the five waves of so-called declinist
anxiety that political scientist Samuel Huntington famously
identified.]{.underline}

Many [analysts have attributed Americans' current anxiety to the
aftershock of waging two long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan]{.underline}.
But the [polls]{.underline} actually [reflect something deeper and more
potent---a legitimate, increasingly tactile uncertainty in the minds of
the American people created by changes in the world and in America's
competitive position, which they feel far more immediately than do the
participants in Washington policy debates]{.underline}. Average
Americans do not experience the world through the lens of great-power
rivalry or U.S. leadership abroad, but rather through that of an
increasingly competitive globalized labor market, stagnating income
growth among the middle class, and deep and unresolved worries about
their children's future. A recent cnn poll, for instance, found that
Americans think by a 2-to-1 margin that their children's lives will be
worse than their own. They are questioning the promise of growth and
expanding opportunity---the very substance of the American dream.

[This anxiety is real and justified, and it lies behind much of the
public's support for withdrawing from the world, for retrenchment. Yet
American leadership and engagement remain essential. The United States
cannot hide from the world. Rather, it must compete. And if it competes
well, it can restore not only its economic health, but also its strength
for the long haul. That resilience will preserve Americans' ability to
determine their fate and the nation's ability to lead in the way its
interests require.]{.underline}

Unfortunately, [absent from current discussions about U.S. foreign
policy has been a hardheaded assessment of what it will actually take to
rejuvenate and compete.]{.underline} Policymakers and experts have not
yet taken a clear-eyed look at the data and objectively analyzed the
fundamental shifts under way globally and what they mean for America's
competitive position. Nor have they debated the steps necessary to
sustain U.S. power over the long term.

THE WORLD'S ECONOMIC CENTER OF GRAVITY

[The larger a country's GDP, the greater its pull on the world's
economic center of gravity.]{.underline} So when the Industrial
Revolution spurred massive growth in the United States, [the center
moved west, eventually out over the Atlantic Ocean. Today, it is moving
back toward Asia.]{.underline}

Many foreign-policy experts seem to believe that retaining American
primacy is largely a matter of will---of how America chooses to exert
its power abroad. Even President Obama, more often accused of being a
prophet of decline than a booster of America's future, recently asserted
that the United States "has rarely been stronger relative to the rest of
the world." The question, he continued, is "not whether America will
lead, but how we will lead."

But will is unavailing without strength. [If the United States wants the
international system to continue to reflect its interests and values---a
system, for example, in which the global commons are protected, trade is
broad-based and extensive, and armed conflicts among great nations are
curtailed---it needs to sustain not just resolve, but relative power.
That, in turn, will require acknowledging the uncomfortable truth that
global power and wealth are shifting at an unprecedented pace, with
profound implications.]{.underline} Moreover, [many of the challenges
America faces are exacerbated by vulnerabilities that are largely
self-created, chief among them fiscal policy. Much more quickly and
comprehensively than is understood, those vulnerabilities are reducing
America's freedom of action and its ability to influence
others.]{.underline}

[Preserving America's international position will require it to restore
its economic vitality and make policy choices now that pay dividends for
decades to come. America has to prioritize and to act. Fortunately, the
United States still enjoys greater freedom to determine its future than
any other major power, in part because many of its problems are within
its ability to address. But this process of renewal must begin with
analyzing America's competitive position and understanding the gravity
of the situation Americans face.]{.underline}

FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 200 YEARS, [MOST GROWTH IS OCCURRING IN THE
DEVELOPING WORLD]{.underline}, and the speed with which that shift---a
function of globalization---has occurred is hard to fathom. Whereas in
1990 just 14 percent of cross-border flows of goods, services, and
finances originated in emerging economies, today nearly 40 percent do.
As recently as 2000, the gdp of China was one-tenth that of the United
States; just 14 years later, the two economies are equal (at least in
terms of purchasing power parity).

This shift reorders what was, in some sense, a historical anomaly: the
transatlantic dominance of the past 150 years. As illustrated by the map
below, it wasn't until the Industrial Revolution took hold in the 19th
century that the world's "economic center of gravity" decisively moved
toward Europe and the United States, which have since been the primary
engines of growth. Today, however, the economic center of gravity is
headed back toward Asia, and it is doing so with unique historical
speed.

This trend will persist even though emerging economies are hitting
roadblocks to growth, such as pervasive corruption in India and
demographic challenges and serious distortions in the banking system in
China. For instance, according to the asset-management firm BlackRock
and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (oecd),
consumption in emerging markets has already eclipsed that in the United
States, and spending by the middle classes in Asia-Pacific nations is on
track to exceed middle-class spending in North America by a factor of
nearly six by 2030.

U.S. wealth is not shrinking in absolute terms---and it continues to
benefit from economic globalization---but the United States and its
allies are losing might compared with potential rivals. Although Europe
and Japan have been responsible for much of the developed world's lost
relative economic power, the U.S. economy has also slowed from its
traditional rates of expansion over the past several decades. Worsening
productivity growth has played a particularly large role in the U.S.
slowdown, dropping to around 0.5 percent annually, which the Financial
Times has referred to as a "productivity crisis." A range of factors are
responsible, including a decline in the skill level of the American
workforce and a drop in resources allocated to research and development.

U.S. REVENUE VS. SPENDING

By 2043, federal spending on entitlements and net interest payments will
exceed federal revenues, meaning funds for any discretionary programs
will be borrowed.

Overall, [**the U.S. economy has become less competitive**. The McKinsey
Global Institute, for instance, has measured the relative attractiveness
of the United States across a range of metrics, such as national
spending on research and development and foreign direct investment as a
percentage of gdp. It found that U.S. business attractiveness relative
to that of competitors fell across 14 of 20 key metrics from 2000 to
2010---and improved in none]{.underline}. And according to the Harvard
Business Review, [U.S. exports' global market share dropped across the
board from 1999 to 2009 and suffered particularly sharp falls in
cutting-edge fields such as aerospace.]{.underline}

This [shift in economic growth toward the developing world is going to
have strategic consequences.]{.underline} Military power ultimately
derives from wealth. It is often noted that the United States spends
more on defense than the next 10 countries combined. But growth in
military spending correlates with gdp growth, so as other economies
grow, those countries will likely spend more on defense, reducing the
relative military power of the United States. Already, trends in global
defense spending show a rapid and marked shift from the United States
and its allies toward emerging economies, especially China. In 2011, the
United States and its partners accounted for approximately 80 percent of
the military spending by the 15 countries with the largest defense
budgets. But, according to a McKinsey study, that share could fall
significantly over the next eight years---perhaps to as low as 55
percent.

The resulting deterioration in American military superiority has already
begun, as the countries benefiting most rapidly from globalization are
using their newfound wealth to build military capacity, especially in
high-tech weaponry. As Robert Work and Shawn Brimley of the Center for a
New American Security wrote this year: "\[T\]he dominance enjoyed by the
United States in the late 1990s/early 2000s in the areas of high-end
sensors, guided weaponry, battle networking, space and cyberspace
systems, and stealth technology has started to erode. Moreover, this
erosion is now occurring at an accelerated rate." (Work has since been
confirmed as deputy secretary of defense.)

[China]{.underline}, in particular, [is acquiring higher-end
capabilities and working to establish "no-go zones" in its near abroad
in the hopes of denying U.S. forces the ability to operate in the
Western Pacific. China's declared defense budget grew 12 percent this
year---and has grown at least ninefold since 2000]{.underline}---and
most experts think its real defense spending is considerably larger. The
International Institute for Strategic Studies has judged that Beijing
will spend as much on defense as Washington does by the late 2020s or
early 2030s. Meanwhile, [regional powers like Iran---and even nonstate
actors like Hezbollah---are becoming more militarily formidable as it
becomes easier to obtain precision-guided munitions and thus threaten
U.S. power-projection capabilities.]{.underline}

Simultaneously, [the United States is slashing its defense spending
while allocating its remaining funds less strategically]{.underline}.
Not only has the Defense Department estimated that it has already cut
almost \$600 billion from its budget plans for the next decade, but if
current trends continue, by 2021 nearly half of the Pentagon's budget
will go to personnel-related costs, rather than procurement, training,
research and development, or operations.

The U.S. National Intelligence Council recently projected the future
distribution of global power using two distinct methodologies that
incorporated a range of "hard" and "soft" factors. By both estimates,
the U.S. share of global power will fall dramatically, from around 25
percent in 2010 to around 15 percent in 2050. The National Intelligence
Council predicted that over the same period, the relative power of the
European Union and Japan will fall significantly as well.

The United States is worsening this problem by refusing to confront its
federal debt and deficits. Unsustainable fiscal policy will limit U.S.
competitiveness and freedom of action in the world with a severity and
alacrity not remotely appreciated in today's U.S. foreign-policy
debates. The total federal debt currently held by the public, which
includes foreign creditors, is approximately \$13 trillion. That is
almost three-quarters of U.S. gdp, the highest it has ever been except
for a brief period during and after World War ii. Moreover, the drivers
of the debt are entitlement programs that will impose enormous costs
indefinitely.

GDP OF G-7 AND E-7 COUNTRIES.

Today, well over 60 percent of federal revenue is consumed by spending
on Social Security, the major health-care programs (including Medicare,
Medicaid, and subsidies under the Affordable Care Act), and interest
payments on the federal debt. By 2043, spending on entitlements and net
interest payments will consume all federal revenue, according to the
Congressional Budget Office. Every dollar the U.S. government spends on
anything else---defense, intelligence, foreign affairs, the federal
justice system, infrastructure, science and technology, education, the
space program---will be borrowed. And by that time, the total federal
debt held by the public will far exceed U.S. gdp.

Recent attempts to address the problem have only resulted in fiasco. The
"sequester" imposed automatic, arbitrary, across-the-board cuts to
discretionary spending---precisely the spending that is not causing the
fiscal problem---with the heaviest burden falling on defense. Most
spending for entitlements was untouched. One could hardly imagine an
outcome more likely to reduce American power, and quickly.

The unwillingness to choose a sustainable fiscal path is forcing the
United States to forgo the investments necessary to sustain the domestic
sources of its power, and it is already eroding its strength abroad.
Among allies, adversaries, and swing states alike, U.S. fiscal policy is
increasingly calling into question America's ability to lead globally.

FOR ALL THESE CHALLENGES TO ITS INFLUENCE, [THE UNITED STATES RETAINS
ENORMOUS POTENTIAL STRENGTH. Far more so than other great powers, it has
the advantages and resources---political, economic, geographical,
geologic, and cultural---to maintain the greatest freedom of action over
the long haul. But **it needs to focus on its competitiveness**,
beginning with a few key priorities.]{.underline}

Because America's fiscal policy affects everything else and because the
current trajectory is unsustainable, entitlement reform is inevitable.
The only question is when it will begin. A number of the fixes that
could have the most significant impact are straightforward and could be
phased in over time with minimal disruption. For example, increasing the
retirement age---which could be done over a decade or longer---would
substantially improve America's fiscal condition.

Investing effectively in infrastructure---long a U.S. comparative
advantage, now increasingly a relative weakness---would boost
productivity and growth over the long term. So would reforming corporate
tax laws to encourage companies to bring profits home. (The current
system creates perverse incentives for companies to maximize tax
advantages by keeping profits out of the United States.)

The nation can also focus on enhancing productivity in parts of its
economy that would benefit greatly from even modest improvements. As
writer Reihan Salam and others have shown, sectors such as health care
and education---which together comprise a quarter of the country's
economy---are inefficient compared with other oecd nations. Government
services are laggard. Introducing best business practices and up-to-date
information technology to those areas would not only improve Americans'
lives, but would also tap underexploited sources of national wealth.

With respect to defense policy, the United States must be ruthlessly
strategic in its spending and preparations, prioritizing the principal
source of its military advantage: technological superiority. This means
focusing increasingly scarce defense dollars on next-generation weapons,
such as stealthy bombers and quiet submarines, and on the assets that
make them smarter than their enemy counterparts---command, control,
communication, and computer systems, as well as intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities. And it means fielding
these capabilities with a better-trained, leaner military that
de-emphasizes less lucrative investments, such as personnel strength and
systems that cannot survive or prosper in the tougher emerging
military-technological environment.

[THE KEY TO PREVENTING RELATIVE DECLINE---and perhaps sparking a
renaissance in American power---lies not simply in remedying problems
with fiscal responsibility, economic productivity, and military
spending, but in leveraging the country's comparative advantages, which
are significant]{.underline}. [The United States has an open political
system that, historically, has proved able to self-correct and adapt. It
has a culture that favors economic growth, accepts and integrates people
from all over the world, and enables mobility, creativity, and personal
renewal and reinvention. As a result, the nation remains an abiding
destination for foreign investment---a reliable source of growth and
safety in uncertain economic and geopolitical times.]{.underline}

In particular, America's energy boom and its ability to attract talent
from around the world could yield an outsized return on investment.

### 2NC DIB Terminal impact -- growth

#### Econ decline causes global wars 

**Liu 18** Qian Liu, China-based economist. "From economic crisis to
World War III." Project Syndicate. 11/8/2018.
<https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/economic-crisis-military-conflict-or-structural-reform-by-qian-liu-2018-11>

The next economic crisis is closer than you think. But what you should
really worry about is what comes after: [in the **current social,
political, and technological landscape**, a **prolonged economic
crisis**, combined with rising income inequality, could]{.underline}
well **[escalate into a major global military conflict]{.underline}**.

[The]{.underline} 20[08]{.underline}-09 global financial [crisis almost
bankrupted governments and caused systemic collapse]{.underline}.
[Policymakers managed to pull the global economy back]{.underline} from
the brink, [using massive monetary stimulus, including]{.underline}
**[q]{.underline}**uantitative **[e]{.underline}**asing
[and]{.underline} near-[zero]{.underline} ([or even
negative]{.underline}) interest [rates]{.underline}.

But monetary stimulus is like an adrenaline shot to jump-start an
arrested heart; it can revive the patient, but it does nothing to cure
the disease. Treating a sick economy requires structural reforms, which
can cover everything from financial and labour markets to tax systems,
fertility patterns, and education policies.

Policymakers have utterly failed to pursue such reforms, despite
promising to do so. Instead, they have remained preoccupied with
politics. From Italy to Germany, forming and sustaining governments now
seems to take more time than actual governing. Greece, for example, has
relied on money from international creditors to keep its head (barely)
above water, rather than genuinely reforming its pension system or
improving its business environment.

The lack of structural reform has meant that the unprecedented excess
liquidity that central banks injected into their economies was not
allocated to its most efficient uses. Instead, it raised global asset
prices to levels even higher than those prevailing before 2008.

In the United States, housing prices are now 8% higher than they were at
the peak of the property bubble in 2006, according to the property
website Zillow. The price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio, which measures
whether stock-market prices are within a reasonable range, is now higher
than it was both in 2008 and at the start of the Great Depression in
1929.

As monetary tightening reveals the vulnerabilities in the real economy,
the collapse of asset-price bubbles will trigger another economic crisis
-- one that could be even more severe than the last, because we have
built up a tolerance to our strongest macroeconomic medications. A
decade of regular adrenaline shots, in the form of ultra-low interest
rates and unconventional monetary policies, has severely depleted their
power to stabilise and stimulate the economy.

If history is any guide, [the consequences of this mistake could extend
far beyond the economy]{.underline}. [According to
Harvard's]{.underline} [Benjamin Friedman, **prolonged periods of
economic distress** have been characterised]{.underline} also [by public
**antipathy toward minority groups or foreign countries** -- attitudes
that can help to **fuel unrest**]{.underline},
**[terrorism]{.underline}**, [or even]{.underline}
**[war]{.underline}**.

For example, [during the Great Depression]{.underline}, US President
Herbert [Hoover signed]{.underline} the 1930
**[Smoot-Hawley]{.underline}** Tariff Act, intended to protect American
workers and farmers from foreign competition. In the subsequent five
years, global trade shrank by two-thirds. [Within a decade, **World War
II** had begun]{.underline}.

To be sure, WWII, like World War I, was caused by a multitude of
factors; there is no standard path to war. But there is reason to
believe that high levels of inequality can play a significant role in
stoking conflict.

[According to research by]{.underline} the economist Thomas
[**Piketty**, a spike in income inequality is often followed by a
**great crisis**]{.underline}. Income inequality then declines for a
while, before rising again, until a new peak -- and a new disaster.
Though causality has yet to be proven, given the limited number of data
points, this correlation should not be taken lightly, especially with
wealth and income inequality at historically high levels.

This is all the more worrying in view of the numerous other factors
stoking social unrest and diplomatic tension, including technological
disruption, a record-breaking migration crisis, anxiety over
globalisation, political polarisation, and rising nationalism. All are
symptoms of failed policies that could turn out to be trigger points for
a future crisis.

Voters have good reason to be frustrated, but the [emotionally appealing
**populists**]{.underline} to whom they are increasingly giving their
support are offering ill-advised solutions that [will **only make
matters worse**]{.underline}. For example, [despite the world's
unprecedented interconnectedness, **multilateralism is increasingly
being eschewed**]{.underline}, as countries -- most notably, Donald J.
[Trump's US -- pursue unilateral, isolationist policies]{.underline}.
Meanwhile, [**proxy wars** are **raging in Syria and
Yemen**]{.underline}.

Against this background, [we must take seriously the possibility that
the **next economic crisis could lead to a large-scale military
confrontation**]{.underline}. By the logic of the political scientist
Samuel Huntington, considering such a scenario could help us avoid it
because it would force us to take action. In this case, the key will be
for policymakers to pursue the structural reforms that they have long
promised while replacing finger-pointing and antagonism with a sensible
and respectful global dialogue. The alternative may well be global
conflagration.

#### Economic collapse causes war 

**Tønnesson, 15** - Professor, Peace Research Institute Oslo; Leader of
East Asia Peace program, Uppsala University (Stein, Deterrence,
interdependence and Sino--US peace, International Area Studies Review,
Vol. 18, No. 3, p. 297-311)

Several [recent works]{.underline} on China and Sino--US relations [have
made]{.underline} substantial [contributions to the current
understanding of how and under what circumstances]{.underline} a
combination of [nuclear deterrence and economic interdependence may
reduce the risk of war between major powers]{.underline}. At least four
conclusions can be drawn from the review above: first, those who say
that [interdependence may **both inhibit and drive
conflict**]{.underline} are right. [Interdependence raises the cost of
conflict]{.underline} for all sides [but]{.underline} [asymmetrical or
unbalanced dependencies and negative trade expectations]{.underline} may
[generate tensions leading to trade wars among inter-dependent states
that]{.underline} in turn [increase the risk of military
conflict]{.underline} (Copeland, 2015: 1, 14, 437; Roach, 2014). The
risk may increase if one of the interdependent countries is governed by
an inward-looking socio-economic coalition (Solingen, 2015); second, the
risk of war between China and the US should not just be analysed
bilaterally but include their allies and partners. Third party countries
could drag China or the US into confrontation; third, in this context it
is of some comfort that the three main economic powers in Northeast Asia
(China, Japan and South Korea) are all deeply integrated economically
through production networks within a global system of trade and finance
(Ravenhill, 2014; Yoshimatsu, 2014: 576); and fourth, [decisions for
war]{.underline} and peace [are taken by very few people, who act on the
basis of their future expectations]{.underline}. International relations
theory must be supplemented by foreign policy analysis in order to
assess the value attributed by national decision-makers to economic
development and their assessments of risks and opportunities. [If
leaders]{.underline} on either side of the Atlantic [begin to seriously
**fear or anticipate their own nation's decline**]{.underline} then
[they may blame]{.underline} this on [external dependence, appeal to
anti-foreign sentiments, contemplate the use of force to
gain]{.underline} respect or [credibility, adopt protectionist policies,
and]{.underline} ultimately **[refuse to be deterred by]{.underline}**
either [**nuclear arms** or prospects of socioeconomic calamities. Such
a dangerous shift could happen abruptly]{.underline}, i.e. under the
instigation of actions by a third party -- or against a third party.

Yet as long as there is both nuclear deterrence and interdependence, the
tensions [in East Asia]{.underline} are unlikely to escalate to war. As
Chan (2013) says, all states in the region are aware that they cannot
count on support from either China or the US if they make provocative
moves. [The greatest risk is]{.underline} not that a territorial dispute
leads to war under present circumstances [but that **changes in the
world economy** alter those circumstances in ways that render
inter-state peace more precarious]{.underline}. If China and the US fail
to rebalance their financial and trading relations (Roach, 2014) then a
trade war could result, interrupting transnational production networks,
provoking social distress, and exacerbating nationalist emotions. [This
could have unforeseen consequences in the field of security, with
nuclear deterrence remaining the only factor to **protect the world from
Armageddon**, and **unreliably so**]{.underline}. [Deterrence could
**lose its credibility**]{.underline}: one of the two [great powers
might gamble that the other yield in a cyber-war or
conventional]{.underline} limited [war]{.underline}, or third party
countries might engage in conflict with each other, with a view to
obliging Washington or Beijing to intervene.

### 2NC DIB Terminal impact -- hegemony 

#### US hegemony prevents great power war 

**Ward 14** (Alex Ward, Atlantic Council's Brent Scowcroft Center on
International Security on U.S. defense policy and strategy, The
Diplomat, 8-22-2014, \"Only US Can Prevent Great Power War,\" Diplomat,
https://thediplomat.com/2014/08/only-us-can-prevent-great-power-war//KDES).

[As the World War I centennial is celebrated, repressed thoughts of
great power war once again begin to surface. With today's highly
"interconnected global economy" underwritten by a liberal order leading
to the "rise of the rest," it appears unlikely that any state would want
to disrupt the current system]{.underline}. And yet, the constant stream
of somber news reignites fears of a calamitous global catastrophe. In
times of international flux, where the worst seems possible, it is
important to turn to those who can best interpret these eras. In the
case of great power or "hegemonic" wars, there is hardly a greater
authority than Robert Gilpin. In his seminal work on the subject, War
and Change in World Politics, [Gilpin argues that three preconditions
must be met for a hegemonic war to occur. First, Gilpin believes that
the soon-to-be warring parties must feel there is a "'closing in' of
space and opportunities." Second, there must be a general "perception
that a fundamental historical change is taking place." Finally, events
around the world start to "escape human control."]{.underline} Notably,
all three of these conditions currently exist in the world. **[Closing
In]{.underline}** Europe, where great power conflict took place for
centuries, was heavily congested and contested. As powers like Britain,
France, Germany and others rose, they fought for influence and geography
at the expense of the others' territory. Due to the close quarters, any
desire for expansion on one country's part would cause concern in the
others. Today, some say, the world is different. The two powers that
would compete in a war --- the United States and China --- are separated
by a vast ocean, supposedly making it hard for each to antagonize the
other. [This, however, is not true. The map may show an expansive world,
but new technologies --- leading to hyperconnectivity and shorter travel
times, especially for military equipment --- have made the world
"claustrophobic." To wit, when China announced an "Air Defense
Identification Zone" the United States quickly deployed two B-52 bombers
to challenge its claim.]{.underline} And that was using old equipment.
Both China and the United States are developing hypersonic missiles and
vehicles. [Humanity has already conquered physical space with commercial
flight and fast ships. Now, it continues to shrink space even further
for potentially decisive advantage. It is also hard to claim that China
and the United States are far apart when they regularly bump up against
each other as they have in the South China Sea.
**Perception**]{.underline} Since the dawn of "Pax Americana" after
World War II, belief in the United States as the undisputed global
hegemon remained fairly stable. Until now. According to a recent Pew
poll, [Americans' views of the United States as a global power have
reached a 40-year low. Indeed, only 17 percent believe that America
plays a "more important and powerful role than ten years ago." Rightly
or wrongly, this perception exists. Even though most people still find
the United States preferable to China, regional powers can use the
widespread belief that America is declining to make their cases for
running the system. In fact they are already doing so to a degree. For
example, China's Global Times reports that 47 percent of people believe
China has achieved "major power" status. Should both perceptions keep
trending in the same direction --- the United States is declining while
China rises --- then the feeling of an historic shift is almost
inevitable.]{.underline} Human Control As current events prove, [even
the great powers cannot stop horrendous things from happening in the
world.]{.underline} From Latin America and Africa to Eastern Europe, the
Middle East, and East Asia, chaos and turmoil run rampant. While this is
a particularly bad period for international affairs, it is naïve to
think this may be an isolated epoch. In fact, there is reason to think
the world might grow more unstable in the years ahead. Over the next 11
years, the world can expect another one billion people, reaching a total
of around 8 billion by 2030. As technology becomes more powerful, it
will do two things. First, it will empower the individual, or a group of
individuals, to do great good or great harm. Second, it will allow
individuals to be more aware of how the middle class lives. People
around the world will demand similar things, causing stress on
governments and brewing civil unrest and instability. Thus, as people
are further empowered and further angered, the probability that these
non-state actors --- indeed, normal, everyday people --- disrupt
international affairs or geopolitics is high. Governments will continue
to have less and less control of the citizenry, allowing the regular
citizen to do with her newfound power what she wills. In essence, we
will see, in a big way, the diffusion of power. Although the world
currently satisfies Gilpin's three preconditions, there need not be
pessimism. For one, current relations between the United States and
China are nowhere near the point where a potential great war between
them is possible, and there is no other rivalry nearing that of
Washington and Beijing. Second, [some of the trends that can cause harm,
like rapid technological progress, can also be used to help stabilize
the global order. To be sure, technology could be used to curb the
desolation brought on by expectedly low water, food, and energy
levels.]{.underline} Finally, and most importantly, Gilpin's guidance is
certainly not comprehensive. There are more variables for which to
account (i.e. the effect of nuclear weapons) that dictate whether or not
a great power war may take place. That said, Gilpin's framework serves
as a good rubric by which to measure the current global climate. By all
measures, this is certainly a dangerous time. But Gilpin's preconditions
shouldn't be misconstrued as predictive or fatalistic. Indeed, [the
United States, as the hegemon, has the capability (and responsibility)
to preserve the international order and lead the world out of this mess.
By keeping good relations with partners and allies, deterring
adversaries, reversing the perception of its decline, and leveraging
technological capabilities for global good, there is a decent chance
that the U.S. can make the great-power-war-incubation period fade away.
Should the United States not seize this moment, and ensure that China is
a responsible partner in the current global system alongside it, then
the chance of a great power war cannot be dismissed, however
remote.]{.underline}

### 2NC DIB Terminal impact -- tech leadership 

#### Tech leadership is key to military dominance -- competitors are trying to take over now 

**Knox 17** Tyler Knox, student writer @ Penn Wharton Public Policy
Initiative. THE U.S. MILITARY: A CRISIS OF INNOVATION April 24, 2017
https://publicpolicy.wharton.upenn.edu/live/news/1833-the-us-military-a-crisis-of-innovation/for-students/blog/news.php

Overview

In the years following the Gulf War, [America's "competitors" have not
rested quietly. Discomfited by the ease with which the United States
destroyed Iraqi forces, Chinese and Russian strategists sought to
modernize their defense capabilities, investing in modern aircraft,
anti-satellite weapons, and other innovations meant to obviate the
threat of American technology]{.underline} \[3\]. Additionally, while
the U.S. has been involved in counter-terrorism initiatives in Iraq and
Afghanistan, the focus of defense leaders has shifted away from
long-term, disruptive innovation to technologies like surveillance
drones that are applicable to militant insurgencies but are less useful
against conventional opponents. [Shrinking the gap between US and
insurgent capabilities is the proliferation of twenty-first century
technologies]{.underline}: smartphones, social networking, cloud
computing, and drones can be wielded by militant groups and terrorists
alike \[4\]. [Faced with the advancing capabilities of "competitor
states" and stagnant R&D at home, American war planners are now asking a
single question: Is the United States facing a crisis of
innovation?]{.underline}

[Former Defense Secretaries]{.underline} Chuck [Hagel and]{.underline}
Ashton [Carter both recognized the need to reinvigorate American
military innovation]{.underline} under the Obama administration. In
January 2014, Hagel announced the initiation of a "Third Offset
Strategy," consisting of a series of private-public partnerships and
defense R&D to shore up American military superiority \[5\]. Secretary
Carter continued Hagel's efforts by pushing for greater collaboration
between the Defense Department and Silicon Valley \[6\]. However, Carter
is no longer the Secretary of State, and the future of the Third Offset
Strategy remains in doubt under the Trump presidency. Will Defense
Secretary Jim Mattis continue Hagel and Carter's Third Offset Strategy?
Regardless, [the crisis of innovation continues, with American military
preeminence on the line.]{.underline}

Implications

While the United States' focus has been diverted to developing
counter-insurgency technology, [China and Russia have been investing in
innovations aimed at neutralizing American military advantages.
China]{.underline}, in particular, [has prioritized this approach,
formulating]{.underline} a unique strategy of [anti-access/anti-area
denial, which aims to make it too dangerous for the U.S. navy to operate
within the first disputed island chain in the South China
Sea]{.underline}. For example, the aircraft carrier, a verifiable
keystone and symbol of American military might, is now threatened by
Chinese innovation in anti-ship missile technology. Navy strategists
believe that China has successfully developed two missiles capable of
destroying American carriers: the Dongfeng-21D and the YJ-12. The
Dongfeng-21D is capable of closing on its target at 10 times the speed
of sound, rendering it practically impossible to intercept. Likewise,
the YJ-12 strikes its target at more than twice the speed of sound after
skimming along the surface of the water to avoid interception. [The
successful development of anti-ship missiles is not unique to China;
Russia, Iran, and North Korea are all working on weapons capable of
destroying naval carriers. The rising military innovation of America's
competitors is casting doubt on the future]{.underline} of carrier-based
warfare, [raising the risk that the US aircraft carriers would be
rendered useless in the event of a conflict in the South China Sea,
specifically]{.underline} \[7\].

[It is this implication of competitor defense innovation that is
particularly concerning to America's allies. Will the United States be
willing to intervene to protect them from "Chinese
bullying,"]{.underline} for example, considering the risks of deploying
naval carriers in the region? [Could a future U.S. president decide that
the economic and political risks of losing a carrier are too
great]{.underline}, leaving America's Asian allies practically
defenseless to Chinese aggression? [Doubt that the United States can be
depended upon for global security undermines America's global hegemony,
raising the possibility that Asian countries would rather throw in their
lot with China than risk alienating the rising power]{.underline} \[8\].
[This dynamic is also at play in Europe]{.underline}, as fears that the
United States may be unwilling to support its European partners have
lead to mounting pressure for the region to develop its own nuclear
weapons program. A "Eurodeterrent" plan would place France's nuclear
arsenal under a common European command, funding program, or defense
doctrine to protect European Union member states \[9\]. While such an
escalation in European military power is highly unlikely, [the talks

its global superiority]{.underline}.

[The United States continues to dominate the]{.underline} international
[arms trade, dwarfing its nearest competitor, Russia, by \$184.9
billion.]{.underline}

In 2017, [Russian weapons manufacturers sold about \$37.7 billion worth
of arms, compared to \$222.6 billion in sales by American
producers]{.underline}, according to an annual report by the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) released Monday. [The
amount of weapons sales from U.S. companies is just shy of six times
higher than those of Russia.]{.underline}

#### The plan causes a switch to Russian and Chinese arms

[There are two parts to Defense Secretary]{.underline} James [Mattis\'s
trip to the Far East this week to woo countries **away from Russia and
China: charm and arms**]{.underline}.

As President Donald Trump talks (and tweets) about [an \"America First\"
foreign policy]{.underline} that will have us \"winning\" again, it
[falls to officials]{.underline} like Mattis [to convince countries to
lean **toward the United States and away from**]{.underline} their close
neighbor **[China and]{.underline}** ever-present arms maker
**[Russia]{.underline}**.

So, for starters, Mattis has been smiling---a lot. On the just-concluded
Indonesian swing of this trip, he kept grinning during a demonstration
by Indonesian troops that included both snake blood and men rappelling
from helicopters with German shepherds strapped to their chests. And he
smiled later as he left Indonesia on the cusp of an agreement to sell 48
F-16 fighter jets the world\'s biggest Muslim nation.

Mattis landed in Vietnam on Wednesday with a similar challenge, this
time showing up a day after Russia's defense minister made his best
pitch for Russian weapons in Hanoi. The timing makes Mattis something of
a de facto secretary of state.

"What we're looking for here is that small nations get the same respect,
the same regard, as large nations," Mattis said. He was describing the
trip to reporters earlier on the flight from Washington aboard his E4-B
aircraft, which is outfitted to run a nuclear war and is affectionately
known as the "doomsday plane." "Every nation matters, and there cannot
be any bullying or shredding of trust toward others.\"

Washington is concerned that **[China]{.underline}**, in the midst of a
land grab for every rock in the South China Sea, **[will come to
dominate the smaller countries]{.underline}** that rim that body of
water, **[and]{.underline}** that **[Russia will become their arms

Phase Three: The "Chinese Marshall Plan"? Arms Transfer in the New
Century On 22 July 1998, an enlarged session of the Central Military
Commission was held in Beijing. At the session, Jiang Zemin, the head of
the CCP in the post-Deng era, announced that the military sector would
be prohibited from commercial activities. Jiang also urged the PLA to
refocus on its professional tasks and military modernization (Mulvenon
2001). After that session, [a series of reforms was introduced to the
defense sector to clear organizational obstacles to technological
innovation and to bolster defense research]{.underline} (Cheung 2009;
Mulvenon and Tyroler-Cooper 2009). [Although researchers have different
opinions about the extent of the military's resistance to the reforms,
they generally agree that this wave of reform set the stage for the
later development of China's defense industry]{.underline} (Scobell
2000; Mulvenon 2001; Cheung 2009). Also, the government increased the
share of the defense sector in the public budget after 1998. From 1994
to 1998, military expenditure accounted for 1.7 percent of China's gross
national product (GNP). That proportion rose to 2.1 percent for the
period between 2001 and 2005 (Figure 3). [This increase generated
immediate consequences. In 1998, China was still the world's 7th largest
military spender; five years later, China was second only to the U.S.,
though its military spending was only one-tenth of the latter's.
However, this massive gap is also narrowing. In 2015, China's military
spending was approximately one third that of the United States (SIPRI).
With its strengthened economic and military capacities, what is the main
goal of China's grand strategy in the twenty-first century? How does the
new leadership plan to fulfill this goal? In a 2013 trip to the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, Xi Jinping,
the present head of the CCP, announced China's "21st-Century Maritime
Silk Road" initiative, a development framework to boost trade, shipping,
tourism, and maritime infrastructure in South Asia and
Africa.]{.underline} Based on the blueprint, the Maritime Silk Road
starts at the South China Sea, travels through the Strait of Malacca
into the Bay of Bengal, crosses the Indian Ocean and reaches the African
continent in Nairobi. From Kenya, the proposed Maritime Silk Road then
turns north, traverses the Suez Canal, and finally arrives at its
European destination, Venice. This initiative is one half of China's
"One Belt, One Road" development strategy. The other part, the "Silk
Road Economic Belt" initiative, starts in Northwest China, travels
across Central Asian countries to reach the Middle East, then turns to
Eastern Europe, and finally meets the Maritime Silk Road in Italy.13
This "belt" aims to link China economically and culturally to Europe
through Central and Western Asia and to strengthen China's influence in
these regions. Why is China promoting the "One Belt, One Road"
initiative? As some scholars have pointed out, despite China's drastic
economic development over the last three decades, its capital
accumulation regime has recently experienced several structural problems
in terms of its sustainability. China's export-dependent economy has
internalized the global crisis of over-accumulation and falling profits
(Hung 2008). [Without a robust domestic market, Chinese investors have
to look abroad for more trade and investment opportunities.]{.underline}
According to the Ministry of Commerce, China's outbound foreign direct
investment has maintained steady growth for a decade. However, the need
for foreign markets is only one reason. Indeed, [the "One Belt, One
Road" initiative also offers a roadmap for further extension of China's
influence, which, as The Diplomat commentator William Yale argues, is
"intended to serve diplomatic, economic, and strategic purposes" (2015).
This is the reason why several analysts have already called this
strategy the "Chinese Marshall Plan]{.underline}" (Stokes 2015; Pitlo
III 2015). [This "plan" has been well supported by the arms transfer
regime of the new century. After 2000, the quantity and value of Chinese
arms transfers climbed, though with fluctuation]{.underline} (Figure 1.1
and 1.2). Growth became more stable after 2006. According to SIPRI,
[China replaced the United Kingdom as the world's fifth largest arms
supplier between 2008 and 2012, accounting for 5 percent of world arms
transfers. According to WMEAT, China was the sixth largest supplier
between 2008 and 2011. 14 While the growth rate and ranking may
exaggerate the actual size of China's arms exports, what is more
relevant is the distribution.]{.underline} According to WMEAT, between
2001 and 2011, 38 percent of arms exports from China were delivered to
South Asia, 19 percent to the Middle East, 12 percent each to North
Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa, and 6 percent each to East Asia and South
America. Specifically, between 2007 and 2011, the five largest Asian
recipient countries of China's weapons were Pakistan, Myanmar, Saudi
Arabia, Syria, and Sri Lanka. In Africa, they were Algeria, Egypt,
Nigeria, Sudan, and Chad. SIPRI statistics show a similar geographic
pattern. According to SIPRI, between 2001 and 2014, three fourths of
Chinese arms exports were delivered to other Asian countries, with
Africa receiving another fifth. The remaining arms exports were
delivered to Latin America. Indeed, while Asia was the largest outlet
for Chinese weapons, Africa had most of China's clients. [A closer
examination of the recipients exposes the deeper connection between
China's arms exports and its strategic interests in trade, energy, and
raw materials, as well as geopolitics in Asia and Africa. As mentioned
above, one goal of the "One Belt, One Road" initiative is to extend
foreign markets for Chinese products. The major recipient countries and
regions of Chinese weapons appear also to be important trade partners
for China.]{.underline} For example, in 2012, South Asia took a 13
percent share of China's exports; this number grew to 17 percent in the
first two months of 2015 (MOFCOM). In 2009, China became Africa's
largest trade partner, and China's exports to Africa grew by 16.7
percent over the following two years. According to SIPRI, Egypt is the
largest African recipient of Chinese arms and one of the largest African
importers of Chinese goods in general. In 2011, Egypt accounted for 12
percent of Chinese exports to Africa, second only to the Republic of
South Africa (Rahal 2014). In Southeast Asia, Myanmar is the largest
importer of Chinese weapons. In 2011, China also became Myanmar's
largest trade partner and its largest source of foreign investment
(MOFCOM). Indonesia (second largest arms importer in Southeast Asia),
Bangladesh (second in South Asia), and Pakistan (first in South Asia)
are also important foreign markets for China's civilian goods and
investment (SIPRI). [Several major recipient countries of Chinese
weapons are also the main suppliers of energy and raw materials for
China. Observers in Western societies have always been interested in
Chinese national oil companies (NOCs) in Africa, which have been
expanding since the mid1990s. Today, crude oil is China's top imported
product from Africa (MOFCOM).]{.underline} In 2009, for example, [70
percent of African exports to China were crude oil (Lin 2013). Sudan is
China's largest oil supplier and the third largest importer of Chinese
weapons in Africa]{.underline} (SIPRI; Downs 2010). In 2006, Chinese
NOCs' oil production in Sudan accounted for over 80 percent of its total
in Africa (Downs 2007). Indeed, [China's entrenched interests in Sudan
have caught much criticism from Western observers. Some have criticized
Beijing for selling arms to Sudan in spite of its ongoing civil war, and
news was released that Khartoum had used Chinese fighter planes and
military trucks for ethnic cleansing in the Sudanese rebel]{.underline}
South (Taylor 2006). [Indonesia and Tanzania are two other cases in
which China's interests in natural resources are intertwined with weapon
sales. Indonesia is the second largest recipient of Chinese weapons in
Southeast Asia (SIPRI) and a major exporter of minerals to
China.]{.underline} In 2014, 33 percent of China's imports from
Indonesia were minerals (MOFCOM). According to SIPRI, Tanzania is
China's second largest arms importer in Africa and one of China's major
trade partners on the continent. Since 2004, ores have dominated the
Chinese import profile from Tanzania (Jansson, Burke, and Hon 2009).
China combines arms sales with participation in UN peacekeeping missions
and diplomatic initiatives to strengthen its geopolitical position.
Until 2009, more than half of China's peacekeeping forces were deployed
in Africa (Zhao 2009). One example of this synergy, mentioned above, is
the Sino-Sudan connection. Several times in the 2000s, Beijing helped
Khartoum obstruct United Nations Security Council (UNSC) intervention
(Taylor 2006; Tull 2008). Sudan was confirmed as China's "all-weather
friend" in 2007 (Large 2008). Pakistan, the biggest importer of China's
weapons in the world, has kept close ties with China since the 1970s.
During the 1989 Tiananmen protests, Pakistan was one of the only two
countries (the other being Cuba) that supported the CCP's actions. In
2015, the two parties brought Sino-Pakistani relations to a new height.
During President Xi's visit to Pakistan in April, China proposed an
infrastructure project that would connect a major land route in the
Xinjiang Autonomous Region to the Chinesedeveloped Pakistani port at
Gwadar. According to Washington Post commentator Ishaan Tharoor, this
project served as a key cog in China's vision of a new land and maritime
"Silk Road" (2015). Also during Xi's visit, an announcement was made
elevating the Sino-Pakistan relationship to an "all-weather strategic
partnership," the highest level in China's diplomatic relations. In
short, with strengthened support from political institutions and the
burgeoning economy, the military sector was prohibited from commercial
ventures and was reoriented towards its professional tasks in the
late-1990s and early-2000s. Unlike in the previous phase, GDP growth was
quickly transformed into growth in military spending after 2000. A grand
strategy aimed at extending China's global outreach mainly based in Asia
and Africa gradually took shape and was finally formulated as the "One
Belt, One Road" initiative, in the twenty-first century. During this
phase, arms exports bolster this grand strategy. Specifically, [arms
exports are connected to China's interests in trade, energy, and raw
materials, as well as geopolitics.]{.underline} This new pattern of arms
transfer has both similarities and differences from that of the Mao era.
Both regimes are globallyfocused, unlike the nationally-oriented regime
in the second phase. [Each has served one of China's grand strategies
and strengthened its connections to the outside world, though to a
degree more limited than in the Mao era. Also, both regimes are led and
fueled by political institutions, which are willing and able to mobilize
national resources to plan and support outbound arms transfers. However,
arms transfer in the third phase differs from that in the Mao era in
important respects. In the Mao era, China's support, in various ways
including military aids to "communist brothers" and other Third World
countries was framed and declared as a moral obligation. It had the goal
of securing China's position in a world shadowed by the Cold War. On the
contrary, in the current regime, the narrative of "benevolent
brotherhood" has been replaced by one of mutual benefits and
articulation of China's interests. In the third phase, rather than a
financial burden on the state, the arms transfer regime has become an
organic component of China's globally-focused grand
strategy.]{.underline}

#### Authoritarianism causes global wars -- multiple flashpoints escalate 

**Joshi 18** Shashank Joshi Senior Policy Fellow for International
Affairs, Renewing the Centre Authoritarian Challenges to the Liberal
Order Posted on: 21st June 2018
https://institute.global/insight/renewing-centre/authoritarian-challenges-liberal-order

What does this mean for democracies? [Autocracies present a series
of]{.underline} individual [challenges]{.underline} to their local
rivals: [Russia to the Baltic states, China to Taiwan and North Korea to
South Korea]{.underline}, for instance. But [the problem they pose to
world order is larger than the sum of these issues. It is]{.underline},
rather, [an ideological]{.underline} and systemic [challenge that will
reshape the norms of international relations. Will these norms reflect
liberal principles such as openness]{.underline}, rule following and
individual rights [or competing authoritarian ones such as secrecy,
arbitrariness and state power]{.underline}?

[This competition over norms will influence]{.underline} not only
Western liberal democracies but also [the wider multipolar order that is
emerging. In regions with weak political institutions]{.underline} or
nascent democracies---parts of [Africa, South and Southeast
Asia]{.underline}, and [East and Southeast Europe---the regional order
is especially malleable. If authoritarian states can shape these
regions]{.underline} in their own image, [this]{.underline} bolsters
their global standing and [puts liberal democracy further on the back
foot]{.underline}. This argument does not require an acceptance that
democracies always act in liberal ways or adhere to a single and
consistent set of norms. Authoritarian states also differ widely in
levels of openness and repression, the balance between civilian and
military authority, and civil versus political freedoms.11 Yet despite
this variety, there remain systematic differences between democratic and
authoritarian states in attitude, inclination and values---and [this has
important]{.underline} foreign policy [implications]{.underline}.

TYPES OF AUTHORITARIAN CHALLENGE

The authoritarian challenge to liberal democracy can be broken down into
six categories.

[The Military Challenge]{.underline}

[Authoritarian states represent the most serious military threat to the
democracies of Europe and Asia. Russia has dissolved]{.underline}
existing [norms regarding the use of force]{.underline}, conducting in
Europe the first annexation of territory and the first use of chemical
weapons since the Second World War.12 [Russia's use of hybrid
warfare]{.underline}, which prioritises secrecy, deception and political
warfare, [presents a]{.underline} particular [danger to rule-bound open
societies]{.underline}.13 [China]{.underline}, though more cautious,
[has]{.underline} also [demonstrated increasingly assertive behaviour in
the South China Sea]{.underline}, including the militarisation of
reclaimed islands, the rejection of arbitration efforts [and an
escalation of the country's border dispute with India]{.underline}.14

The military challenge posed by authoritarian states is not a quirk of
the past few years. Russian and Chinese behaviour is rooted in their
resentment of the Western order, ambition for great power status and
fear of Western power.15 All three of [these drivers are shaped by these
countries' authoritarian political systems. The best available
scholarship continues to show that democracies enjoy more peaceful
relations with other democracies than with autocracies]{.underline},
suggesting that [authoritarian states are intrinsically more likely to
be threatening]{.underline}.16 [Among states that ratify treaties
governing the laws of war, democracies are]{.underline} also [more
likely to comply with these rules than autocracies are]{.underline}.17

The Coercion Challenge

Military threats are the most serious form of coercion, but more common
is the use of broader, often more subtle, political and economic
pressure to intimidate and cajole liberal democracies into changing
their behaviour. [Authoritarian countries use coercion to secure
specific interests, such as China's successful embargo and isolation of
Norway]{.underline} after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to a
dissident in 2010, [or]{.underline} to influence a country's strategic
orientation, such as [Russia's use of intimidation to scare neutral
countries]{.underline}, such as Sweden and Finland, away from the North
Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). All countries use coercion;
consider Western sanctions on Iran and Russia. But autocrats typically
do so to counter threats to their rule or to uphold spheres of influence
abroad, both of which require confronting and undercutting democracy in
other states.18

For instance, China's use of its market power to coerce academic
publishers into curbing access to scholarship and technology firms into
censoring their products points to a gradual and insidious encroachment
on free speech; so does the increasing frequency with which
international firms feel compelled to apologise to China for ideological
infractions, such as acknowledging Taiwan's nationhood or publishing
noncompliant maps.19 The growth of China's strategic investments and
Russia's deepening control over energy supplies represent particular
European vulnerabilities, both of which could be used for future
coercion for a variety of purposes.20

[Other examples of authoritarian coercion include Turkey's campaign to
put pressure on dissident groups abroad, Iran's efforts to target the
Iran-based families of critical foreign media outlets and Russia's
assassinations in Europe]{.underline}.21 Turkey has even threatened to
conduct operations against Western rating agencies that have done as
little as downgrade the country's credit score.22 Such actions will all
have similar long-term chilling effects, unless these campaigns are
blunted.

The Influence Challenge

In addition to overt coercion, [authoritarian states deploy more subtle
means to reshape the intellectual climate of democracies in their
favour]{.underline}. One tactic is to cultivate sympathetic intellectual
and political networks through open or clandestine means, including the
funding of educational or research institutes, and the intensive use of
political lobbying to influence political leaders.23 Another is to
suppress negative press while rewarding and encouraging more pliant
coverage, through selective access and other means. Yet another is the
development of alternative media channels to spread propaganda and sow
confusion.24

Liberal [democratic states are]{.underline} by definition [open. This
makes them]{.underline} especially [vulnerable to authoritarian
influence campaigns]{.underline}, which not only distort national
debates about how to respond to that very challenge but also undermine
the respect for information and faith in objective truth on which the
proper functioning of democracy depends. Influence operations exploit
and compound the problem of declining trust in news media, with levels
of trust well below 50 per cent in the United Kingdom (UK), below 40 per
cent in the United States (US) and at 30 per cent in France.25 Russia's
use of state-controlled print and broadcast media to spread
disinformation around its military and covert actions is the starkest
example.26 At times, Russia has leveraged its influence into direct
intervention, notably in its attempted coup in Montenegro in 2016,
demonstrating how these different types of challenges---physical and
ideological---can meld together.27

China has pursued a less provocative, if no less troubling, approach.28
Beijing's state-controlled media outlets are growing rapidly and
increasing their footprint in Western democracies.29 There is mounting
evidence of the growing propaganda and influence activity of China's
United Front Work Department, the large role of Beijing's
state-controlled Confucius Institutes on foreign university campuses,
and the increasing penetration of paid-for pro-Chinese content such as
editorial partnerships or advertorials in respectable print outlets in
Europe and the United States.30 Authoritarian states in the Middle East
have used similar strategies, through overt channels like Qatar's Al
Jazeera and more clandestine means.31Smaller regimes typically have
fewer resources and narrower ambition, but can still have region-wide
impact: allies of Hungarian President Viktor Orbán have invested in
media outlets of nearby countries, like Slovenia, supporting like-minded
candidates there.32

The Disruption Challenge

Military threats, coercion and influence tend to be aimed at changing
behaviour in specific ways, often through particular policies. But
authoritarian states also target liberal democracies in a broader, less
purposeful way. [Authoritarian powers seek to weaken democratic rivals
and alliances to undermine the ideological appeal of open
societies]{.underline}, in turn consolidating their own power.

This interference occurs on a spectrum ranging from broad propaganda to
cyberattacks to full-blown political subversion.33 Russia's assault on
the 2016 US presidential election and support for extremist political
movements in Europe are the most egregious examples of this challenge.34
This approach was in keeping with Russia's long-standing practice of
active measures---the deliberate effort to widen cracks in an
adversary's society.35 The purpose of these interventions is not only to
elevate individual candidates or parties, or to bargain over a
particular policy, but also to sap confidence in the health of democracy
as a whole.

[The Spread of Authoritarian Norms]{.underline}

The competition between authoritarian states and liberal democracies
[plays out not only through their direct interactions but also with
respect to wider international norms]{.underline}.

This challenge to norms has two dimensions. One is negative, with
authoritarian states arguing that the political and economic
difficulties of the West, and the relatively slower growth of
non-Western democracies like India, demonstrate the failure of the
entire political model. They associate liberal democracy with
stagnation, unpredictability and even chaos.

Alongside this attempt to discredit liberal democracy is a parallel
effort to displace liberal norms---ones that hinder authoritarian
states' freedom of action, or even threaten their own legitimacy---with
alternative ones. [As authoritarian states grow more powerful,
prosperous and confident, their principles are reflected in their
broader foreign policy]{.underline}. These principles include
majoritarianism, absolute sovereignty, boundless executive power,
historical revisionism and personal rule.36 Authoritarian states become
more comfortable with supporting repressive regimes, even in periods of
intense violence, less willing to make cooperation conditional on human
rights and rule-of-law concerns, and more likely to export the
authoritarian behaviours and ideas they practise at home.

These norms can take hold across large areas. [Authoritarian-led
regional blocs]{.underline}, such as the Shanghai Cooperation
Organisation (SCO) or the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), [create space
for illiberal cooperation]{.underline}, for instance allowing the
extradition of suspects on political grounds that would never be
accepted in groupings such as the European Union (EU).37 The
Russian-dominated Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and the
Chinese-led SCO have both created spurious election-monitoring bodies
"that endorse fraudulent elections with the aim of clouding the
assessments made by established monitoring organizations"---a
quintessential example of authoritarian norm setting.38

[Authoritarian norm setting can spread]{.underline} through both
political and economic projects. China's Belt and Road Initiative, a
flagship set of infrastructure and connectivity projects stretching from
Asia to Europe, has empowered strongmen leaders, tilted the
civil-military balance in Pakistan away from civilians, saddled
low-capacity countries with unsustainable debt, favoured Chinese over
local firms or transparent international tendering and paved the way for
an expansion of China's military footprint into new areas.39 The scheme
has provoked a backlash from the US, Europe, India and Japan, among
others, not only because it embodies unfair economic practices, but also
because it squeezes liberal norms---such as transparency and
multilateralism---in key regions like the Indian Ocean.

Internationally, at the United Nations (UN), Russia and China have
systematically targeted human-rights advocacy by attempting to cut
spending for human-rights posts on UN peacekeeping missions, attacking a
human-rights cell in the office of the secretary general, and blocking a
UN human-rights commissioner from addressing the UN Security Council on
Syria.40 More broadly, authoritarian states export their norms not only
by selling or transferring individual tools of surveillance, such as
cameras and software, but also through entire systems of repression.41

Finally, [authoritarian states offer the world an alternative political
model to liberal democracy]{.underline}, capitalising on what they
portray as the congenital shortcomings of open societies. At the 19th
Party Congress of the Chinese Community Party, President Xi Jinping
notably presented China as "a new option for nations who want to speed
up their development while preserving their independence".42 China's
model of authoritarian capitalism, contrasted to the low growth and
political instability of its Western competitors, makes it harder for
democracies to sell their norms to developing countries and can even
reinforce disillusionment in the West. Russia's model of personal rule,
ultranationalism and purported defence of traditional Western
civilisation appeals to would-be strongmen in Europe and beyond.43

The Cohesion Challenge

[Democratic backsliding]{.underline} in the democratic congregation, or
among its aspiring members, [presents a]{.underline} different sort of
[challenge]{.underline}. In recent years, Poland and Hungary have
exemplified this problem. Their [governments have undermined the rule of
law, weakened the free press, removed checks and balances, and vilified
minorities]{.underline}.44 Among countries queuing up to join the EU,
the trends are also worrying. In the Western Balkans, for instance,
media freedom and governance have both been eroding.45 This is partly
linked to the challenges described above, in the form of Russian
disruption, such as a Russian-backed coup attempt in Montenegro, and
influence operations, including the spread of Russian propaganda
channels.46

[This political regression has three major consequences for liberal
democracies]{.underline}. First, [it undercuts the EU's
claim]{.underline}---to its own citizens, to aspiring members and to the
wider world---[to]{.underline} embody liberal [democratic
values]{.underline}. Europe has less credibility in speaking to
backsliding states in Asia, Africa or South America when its own members
can violate core European values with impunity.

Second, democratic backsliders---particularly those of the
populist-nationalist variety---are more likely to advance a view of
international relations that prioritises competition and bargaining over
liberal solidarity. This cuts at the ideological heart of the European
project.

Third, [illiberal-minded leaders]{.underline} in Poland and Hungary, as
well as in Italy, Austria and even the United States, [are more likely
to demonstrate affinity for authoritarian powers like
Russia]{.underline}.47 [This frustrates a common]{.underline} European
and [Western response]{.underline}. Hungary, for instance, was the lone
abstention from a European rebuke of China's Belt and Road Initiative in
late 2017, and blocked a statement on China's conduct in the South China
Sea in 2016.48

Summarising the Challenge

What can we draw from this breakdown of the authoritarian challenge?

First, [this is not just a story of Russia and China]{.underline}. While
Russian revanchism and China's extraordinary economic ascendance make
them two of the most significant authoritarian powers, it would be a
mistake to consider the challenge in these narrow terms. [Authoritarian
middle powers can exert a larger influence]{.underline} on their region
than more distant great powers; [Turkey's impact on the Western Balkans,
the Levant and the Persian Gulf is in many respects larger than that of
China]{.underline}.49

Second, while it is useful to disaggregate these challenges, they can
also flow into one another. [Influence operations that spread propaganda
and false claims can disrupt national politics, undermine cohesion
between allies and function as a coercive threat]{.underline} of more to
come.

#### US beating Russia in arms sales now

**Bershidsky 3-12**-19 (Leonid Bershidsky is Bloomberg Opinion\'s Europe
columnist. He was the founding editor of the Russian business daily
Vedomosti and founded the opinion website Slon.ru. "Trump Is Winning,
Putin\'s Losing in Global Arms Sales," *Bloomberg*, 12 March 2019,
https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-03-12/u-s-is-no-1-in-arms-sales-as-russia-loses-market-share)
//Haus

[Global arms sales are on the increase]{.underline}, consistent with the
growing number of conflicts and deaths brought about by them. [The U.S.
and its allies have been the main beneficiaries. Russia]{.underline}, by
contrast, [is on the decline]{.underline}, a sign that Vladimir Putin's
geopolitical bets aren't turning into long-term influence. The world has
grown significantly less violent since 1950, but there has been an
marked uptick in the number of armed conflicts in recent years. The
emergence of Islamic State, hostilities in eastern Ukraine, and the
persecution of the Rohingya in Myanmar are just some examples. SIPRI has
its own, rather complicated, system for calculating transfer volumes
based on the military value of the equipment traded rather than on its
market price. But in dollar terms, too, Russia trails the U.S.

The number of fatalities has increased even more dramatically, according
to the Uppsala Conflict Data Program. Between 2011 and 2017, the average
annual death toll from conflict neared 97,000, three times more than in
the previous seven-year period. That helps to explain the 7.8 percent
increase in international arms transfers from 2014 to 2018 compared with
the previous five-year period seen in the latest data from the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute, the global authority on the
weapons trade. The Middle East has been absorbing weapons at an alarming
pace: The flow of armaments to the region rocketed by 87 percent in the
last five years. Russia took an active part in the bloodiest of the
conflicts, but it doesn't appear to have been able to convert this into
more sales. It was the only one of the world's top five exporters, which
together account for 75 percent of the business, to suffer a major loss
in market share. It remains the world's second-biggest arms exporter.
Yury Borisov, Russia's deputy prime minister in charge of the defense
industry, said last month that [Russia "steadily reaches" \$15 billion
in arms exports a year]{.underline} and hopes to retain that amount.
This suggests officials believe sales have hit a ceiling.

By contrast, [the U.S. closed \$55.6 billion of arms deals]{.underline}
in 2018, 33 percent more than in 2017, thanks to the Trump
administration's liberalization of weapons exports. According to the
SIPRI figures, [U.S. exports were 75 percent higher than
Russia's]{.underline} in 2014 through 2018 -- [a]{.underline} far
[wide]{.underline}r [gap]{.underline} than in the previous five-year
period.

[For the U.S., Middle Eastern countries have been especially
important]{.underline} -- particularly Saudi Arabia, the world's largest
arms importer, and its major irritant, Qatar. Some 52 percent of U.S.
weapons sales were to the Middle East in the last five years. Under
President Donald Trump, the relationship with Saudi Arabia became even
more lucrative for the defense industry.

[For Russia, the Middle East accounted only for 16 percent of its
weapons exports]{.underline} over the same period, with most going to
Egypt and Iraq. Its major trade partners were India, China and Algeria
-- but sales to India dropped significantly as its government sought to
diversify suppliers and bought more from the U.S., South Korea and, most
painfully for the Kremlin, Ukraine. [Russia has been losing key aircraft
tenders]{.underline} in India [to the U.S.]{.underline} This, along with
the economic collapse of another major client, Venezuela, and the
current potential for regime change in Algeria, all makes [a rebound in
Russian sales look unlikely.]{.underline}

[Arms sales are perhaps the best reflection of a major military power's
international influence]{.underline}. The market isn't all about price
and quality competition; it's about permanent and situational alliances.
[The growing gap between the U.S. and Russia in exports shows that
Putin's forays into areas such as the Middle East are failing to
translate into Russian influence in the region.]{.underline} Although
Putin's warm relations with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi and
his alliance with Iran, which has a lot of influence over Iraq, are
paying off to some extent, they can't quite compensate for ground lost
elsewhere.

[The U.S.'s allies,]{.underline} France, Germany and the U.K. among
them, [have been rapidly increasing their market share,
too]{.underline}. That's a rarely mentioned way in which the security
alliance with Washington is paying off for the Europeans. All the
ethical objections to selling arms to countries such as Saudi Arabia
notwithstanding, European Union member states need markets for their
defense industries, which employ about 500,000 people. Being under the
U.S. umbrella opens doors where Russia and China are less desirable
partners -- that is, in most of the world.

Many tears have been shed in the U.S. about the collapse of the
American-led global order. But [if you take arms sales as a proxy for
influence, the U.S.'s global dominance looks to be
resilient]{.underline}. In a more conflict-prone, competitive world,
America is doing rather well while its longstanding geopolitical rivals
stumble.

#### Russia will fill in- MTCR restricts allowing Russia to fill in to countries the US cannot

**Fink 03/25/19** (Fink, Katherine. "Boots Off the Ground: The Impact of
Individual-Level Factors on American Public Approval of Lethal Drone
Strikes." ScholarlyCommons, CUREJ- College Undergraduate Research
Electronic Journal, 25 Mar. 2019, repository.upenn.edu/curej/223/.)

Despite their capital-intensive nature, drone programs have begun to
spread internationally as more countries strive to develop their own
armed drone fleets. As to be expected from the world's foremost military
power, US UAV procurement and R&D accounted for more than 50% of the
total amount spent worldwide on military UAV procurement and R&D in 2014
(Davis et al., 2014). In 2013, the US was estimated to possess about
7,500 drones in operation, including a wide range of both smaller,
surveillance-based drones as well as larger, lethal drones used for
targeted killings. By comparison, China, which is considered the world's
second largest producer of drones, trailed behind the US by at least
several thousand drones (Boyle, 2014). However, a 2014 study by the RAND
Corporation projects US spending on drones to remain relatively constant
over time and to not increase significantly from 2018 to 2022; this
projection remains subject to change depending on policies set by
presidential administrations. Also, despite its current preeminence in
amount of drones, technological range, and strike capacity, the US is no
longer the world's leading exporter of drones. Instead, Israel has
become the dominant exporter of drones for both domestic and military
uses (Boyle, 2014). Thus, although the US has been the leading actor in
the field of drones so far, the proliferation of drone technology
throughout the international system portends America's waning
comparative advantage. [Looking beyond the US, the development and use
of drones has exploded in recent years]{.underline}. For example,
between 2004 and 2011, the number of states with active UAV programs
doubled, from 40 states to over 80 (Boyle, 2014). By the end of 2014,
twenty-seven countries possessed advanced drones, seven countries
possessed armed drones, and almost twenty-four other countries were
reported to have plans for developing lethal UAV capability (Fuhrmann
and Horowitz, 2017). [Also, there has been a gradual increase in
spending on UAV procurement and R&D by the rest of the world. A RAND
study in 2014 found that China, India, Russia, Taiwan, Turkey, and the
United Arab Emirates were reportedly developing Category I systems,
which encompass medium-altitude, long-endurance UAVs designed for
surveillance, target acquisition, reconnaissance, and
attack.]{.underline} Moreover, the same study determined that Israel,
Pakistan, and South Africa sought to develop Category II systems, which
possess a similar range to Category I yet carry a lighter payload (Davis
et al., 2014). [Beyond just building up their own drone arsenals to be
used for security, countries such as China and Russia have dedicated
themselves to catching up to the US in research and development for
drone technology. In particular, China wishes to become the world's
predominant exporter in the drone market]{.underline}. Over the past few
years, China has sought to establish itself as an alternative
manufacturer of armed drones, producing UAVs such as the CH-3 and Wing
Loong. Currently, Chinese drones lack the same navigational
capabilities, weaponry payload, and range as US drones, but the Chinese
UAV program continues to actively improve (Horowitz, Kreps, and
Fuhrmann, 2016). The Chinese development of a widespread, sophisticated
drone program raises potential concerns for the fate of the
international system. [US exports of drones are currently constrained by
American involvement in the Missile Technology Control Regime, which
limits the sale and export of heavy payload weapons, and the Wassenaar
Agreement, which requires participants to disclose information about
their deliveries. As a result, despite its leading role in technological
capacity and R&D, the US does not actually sell that many drones on the
international market, and when it does, most of these weapons are sold
to NATO allies (Boyle, 2014).]{.underline} In comparison, China
possesses no such restrictions on drone sales, enabling it to sell
weaponry to countries such as North Korea, Iran, and Syria, which are
countries to which the US has refused to export (Boyle, 2014). [Thus, by
potentially selling to erratic countries and non-state actors, China's
role as a rising exporter in drone sales could lead to an increase in
tension and violent conflicts worldwide. An example of this can already
be observed in 2015 when China supplied Iraq, Nigeria, and Pakistan with
armed drones, which were employed against domestic insurgents (Horowitz,
Kreps, and Fuhrmann, 2016). Unfortunately, the sale of lethal drones to
a broader range of countries represents only one of many concerns about
drone proliferation]{.underline}. In his 2014 article, "The Race for
Drones," Michael Boyle presents three primary consequences of drone
proliferation within the international system. As a premise for his
argument, Boyle suggests that states developing drones will likely not
use them in the same manner as the US, that is, as a means of targeted
killing of suspected terrorists. Rather, these countries will most
likely use drones in order to gain an advantage in their regional
rivalries (Boyle, 2014). Building upon this supposition, Boyle first
posits that drone proliferation will result in a redefinition of the
rules and norms governing surveillance and reconnaissance. Although this
could be beneficial in the short-term by improving the flow of
information between countries and reducing the risk of miscalculation,
Boyle argues that in the long-term, such an improved flow of information
could be lead to the development of more aggressive and riskier
countermeasures to stop drone surveillance. That is, in order to ensure
the secrecy of their activities, states being targeted by drones could
utilize more aggressive means of protection such as shooting down drones
in their airspace. Moreover, despite an initial increase in
transparency, drone proliferation could ultimately lead to greater
opaqueness as states implement radar systems to block surveillance,
which would lead to greater information asymmetry and uncertainty.
Second, since they are a low-cost and low-risk form of technology, Boyle
claims that governments will use drones to test the strategic commitment
of their rivals, which could undermine the deterrence inherent in many
tense regional relationships. An example of this phenomenon can be
observed in 2013 when China deployed drones over the contested Senkaku
Islands in the East China Sea as a means of testing Japan's commitment
to controlling the territory. When Japan threatened to shoot the drones
down, China stated that such an action would denote an act of war, which
ratcheted up the preexisting level of tension in their relationship.
Since drones do not possess the potential for loss of a human pilot,
many governments might regard the shoot down of a drone as a negligible
loss, yet such a response could lead to the rapid escalation of
conflict. Finally, Boyle also outlines the concern that drone
proliferation could lead to an increased risk of conflict spirals
stemming from accidents or hijacked drones. As drone usage becomes more
diffuse throughout society, it becomes more difficult to control where
drones fly and prevent them from colliding with civilian aircraft, which
could result in casualties. In response to these consequences, Boyle
suggests restricting the sale of sophisticated drones, banning certain
countries involved in regional rivalries from purchasing drones,
applying user-end agreements that regulate how drones are used once
purchased, and pursuing US-led efforts to establish norms for the use
and sale of drones abroad (Boyle, 2014). Other scholars advance concerns
about drone proliferation due to the dual-use nature of drone
technology, which could raise significant regulatory challenges. Drones
are considered a form of dual-use technology because they can be
utilized in both military and civilian settings. Unlike Boyle and other
scholars who assume that drone related problems could be managed if
there were broader state-level agreement surrounding the enactment of
regulations, Marcus Schulzke argues for the acceptance of drones as an
immovable feature of war, the negative effects of which should be
contained (Schulzke, 2018). He claims that drones are often difficult to
regulate because they are dual-use in a more expansive sense than other
technologies, the drone market is open to a more diverse array of
actors, which makes the restriction of usage more difficult, and greater
familiarity with drones in civilian life increases citizens' support for
armed drones (Schulzke, 2018). This final item raises an interesting
point---in today's society wherein average citizens interact with drones
much more frequently, this familiarity can translate to higher levels of
trust and confidence in the technology. Consequently, higher levels of
trust can lead to greater support for arming drones (Schulzke, 2018). In
light of these concerns, Schulzke advocates for an alternative solution
to the consequences of drone proliferation wherein restrictions should
seek to moderate the pace of development rather than attempting to stop
it entirely or impose an overly elaborate system of regulatory
mechanisms.

#### Arms sales cause Russian military modernization -- lack of revenue now shuts it off

**Worldview** **Stratfor**, 4-29-**2019**,(Worldview Stratfor,
\"Russia\'s Defense Industry Finds Itself in a Tailspin,\" Stratfor,
<https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/russias-defense-industry-finds-itself-tailspin>)
(CB)

[Russia\'s defense industry is face to face with a major foe, but it\'s
not a foreign military power]{.underline}. [The Kremlin has been
striving to modernize all branches of the Russian military, but [the
country\'s defense industry is
struggling](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/russia-procurement-plans-reflect-militarys-modernization-struggles-putin) thanks
to decreasing volumes of orders]{.underline}, [difficulties in
attracting high-skilled talent and limits to its technological
capabilities]{.underline}. According to recent figures, the performance
of Russia\'s aerospace sector is declining precipitously. In 2018, for
instance, Russian aircraft and spacecraft makers produced 13.5 percent
less than in 2017. And [there\'s been no letup in 2019 either: In the
first two months of the year, aerospace output plummeted 48 percent year
on year.]{.underline}

[The decline in Russia\'s defense output raises concerns about the
competitive strength of Russia\'s defense industry in
general]{.underline}, [whose health is critical if the country is to
project itself as a military power in the longer term]{.underline}.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov attributed the reduction in
output to a slowdown of orders for military systems, but [projections
suggest the slowdown is not just a short-term fluctuation; in fact,
it\'s expected to become even worse in the future.]{.underline} [The
downturn in oil prices has taken a bite out of Russia\'s bottom line,
squeezing spending for the military]{.underline} --- all at a time when
the country\'s arms manufacturers have lost their competitive edge in
the global arms market. Together, [these factors ensure that Russia\'s
defense industry will struggle to get out of its funk.]{.underline}

Suffering From a Dearth of Funds

This dire picture stands in stark contrast to Russia\'s frequent
presentation of sensational new platforms. In reality, however, [just a
few of the big-ticket weapon systems --- such as the T-14 main battle
tank or the Su-57 fighter aircraft --- find buyers, as the rest remain
mere prototypes. Russia has prioritized some hardware, such as the
Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, due to their strategic
relevance to the country\'s overall military posture, but Moscow has
failed to fully develop other programs or only introduced them on a
limited scale.]{.underline}

[Under pressure from a limited government budget, [the Kremlin even
started reducing its military
spending](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/what-defense-cuts-mean-russias-military) in
2017 --- a strong indicator that, despite the modernization push,
Russia\'s financial challenges are taking a toll on the country
ambitions]{.underline}. Economically, the plunge in oil prices at the
end of 2014 hurt Russia\'s bottom line, depriving the country of
essential revenue and forcing it to dip into its reserves to bridge the
gap. Today, more than four years on, Russian oil revenues are rising,
yet the country is continuing to deal with the consequences of the lean
years. Beyond that, low revenues from taxes, which have forced Russia to
raise taxes and the retirement age, and [Western
sanctions](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/sanctions-will-widen-russia-west-rift-2019) over
Moscow\'s activities in Ukraine and elsewhere, have shrunk the financial
pool available to military planners.

Low oil prices, declining revenues from taxes and Western sanctions have
taken a chunk out of the financial pool available to Russia\'s military
and the broader defense industry.

But [the Kremlin\'s problems don\'t end there. In the past, Russia has
benefited from its position as a major global arms exporter to fuel
further military development]{.underline}. During the 1990s, for
example, such sales were critical to the country as it faced severe
economic hardship. [While Russia remains the world\'s second-largest
arms exporter]{.underline} (only the United States sells more), [the
actual value of those exports has been decreasing significantly. Between
2014 and 2018, their total value dropped by as much as 17
percent]{.underline}. Again, budgetary limits are somewhat to blame: In
the past, Russia frequently used arms exports as a political tool,
offering weapons at a heavy discount, if not entirely free. But [with
Russia no longer able to offer customers a good deal on its fighter jets
and other defense products, the country is losing business.]{.underline}

And Russia\'s arms industry faces an even greater problem in the years
to come: reduced competitiveness. Russia has long dominated some of the
market by offering affordable military equipment without attaching any
conditions regarding human rights, but the rise of China\'s military
industry, as well as several smaller producers around the world, has
made it much more difficult to compete for contracts.

[Ultimately, the loss of export opportunities not only complicates
Russia\'s efforts to finance its defense industry]{.underline}, [it also
reduces the scale at which the defense industry produces, which, in
turn, decreases scale-dependent savings that accompany higher levels of
production]{.underline}. In effect, [this means that the more Russia
fails to find foreign customers for specific weapon systems, the more it
will become burdened with a higher relative cost per unit as it seeks to
meet its own needs]{.underline}. The conundrum, in turn, will further
limit Russia\'s ability to competitively price weapons systems for
export, thereby perpetuating the effect.

This is why, for example, [India\'s
withdrawal](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/how-losing-indias-business-could-ruin-russias-defense-industry) from
the joint development and production of the Su-57 fighter aircraft last
year has cast doubt on Russia\'s ability to sustain the program in a
meaningful way or at an acceptable cost. As a result, Russia has sought
--- albeit unsuccessfully so far --- to export the Su-57 more widely in
an effort to find a partnership that would make the aircraft viable.

#### Military modernization allows Russia to assert itself as a global power -- causes European tensions

**Klein 16** (Dr. Margarete Klein is a Bosch Public Policy Fellow with
the Transatlantic Academy and a senior associate in the Eastern Europe
and Eurasia Division of the Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP) in
Berlin, March 2016, "RUSSIA'S MILITARY: ON THE RISE?" Transatlantic
Academy. www.gmfus.org/file/7583/download//KDES).

[Russia's plans for military modernization are shaped by its political
and military leadership's geopolitical ambitions,]{.underline} threat
perceptions, and visions of warfare. [The leadership adheres to the
traditional self-perception of Russia as a great power.]{.underline}
Although not striving for global hegemony, [it aspires to a position as
"one of the influential and competitive poles" in a multipolar world ---
understood as being a significant actor who co-determines the world
order and whose interests have to be taken into consideration at least
on all those issues and regions that Moscow defines as strategically
important]{.underline}.6 [Military might is seen as one of three pillars
to Moscow's great power claim.]{.underline} In the diplomatic sphere
Russia points to having a permanent seat in the UN Security Council and
being part of key international formats like BRICS, the Six Party Talks
on North Korea's nuclear program, and P5+1 Iran negotiations. The second
pillar of Russia's great power claim is its possession of vast energy
reserves. [The third pillar is military might. In this context, nuclear
weapons play an important role as one of the last remnants of former
superpower status where Russia is still on equal footing with the United
States. Furthermore, **upholding the great power claim requires Moscow's
armed forces to uphold and develop its capabilities for power projection
in strategically important areas.**]{.underline} While the Asia-Pacific,
the Middle East, and the Arctic have become more important to Russia in
recent years,7 the Euroatlantic region is still Moscow's key point of
reference. Here, [Russia's great power claim boils down to revising the
security architecture that was built after the end of the Cold War.
Russia perceives it as being essentially unjust given NATO's central
role and strives for a new setting that offers Moscow --- de facto or de
jure --- a veto position]{.underline}.8 [Since Russia has less economic
and soft power than NATO and the EU, **there is an increasing temptation
to resort to military means to exert pressure** on the Euroatlantic
countries. However, Russia lags behind NATO's most advanced militaries
in regard to conventional defense technology. Since trying to reach
conventional parity would be a costly endeavor with unclear
perspectives, Russia focuses on asymmetric compensation strategies like
enhancing the capabilities for strategic surprise, anti-access/
area-denial operations (A2AD),]{.underline}9 or hybrid warfare.
Furthermore, [it substantially modernizes its nuclear arsenal and
increasingly sharpens its nuclear rhetoric vis-à-vis the West. Russia's
great power identity shows its most assertive form in regard to the
post-Soviet space, where Moscow strives for a sphere of
influence]{.underline}.10 In this region, [Moscow claims to exclusively
define the rules of the political game and restrict the engagement of
outside actors as well as the right of sovereign countries to pursue an
independent foreign and domestic policy, in particular to choose their
alliances.]{.underline} This quest for hegemony is not a new phenomenon.
In the 1990s, the post-Soviet space was labelled as Russia's "near
abroad," and in 2008, then-President Dmitry Medvedev spoke of a "zone of
privileged interests."11 However, [since Putin began his third term in
2012, Russia has underpinned its hegemonic demands with increasing
political, economic, and military muscle. In order to uphold its claim
for hegemony, the Russian armed forces need to have capabilities both
for fulfilling the role of the main regional security provider --- for
example in countering transnational threats like international
terrorism, and weapons or drug smuggling --- as well as to enforce its
interests by rapid military intervention.]{.underline}

#### Russo-European tensions cause nuclear war

**Drury 17** - Colin, journalist for VICE, citing Ian Shield, associate
lecturer in international relations at Anglia Ruskin University. "What
Would Happen if Russia and Europe Went to War?,"
<https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4xe5a3/what-would-happen-if-russia-and-europe-went-to-war>

But [peace is not inevitable. If you think Europe can\'t descend into a
bar fight]{.underline} like drunks at closing time again, know [you\'re
not the first to believe it. Some people dreamed something
similar]{.underline} during the Concert of Europe---a system put in
place to uphold the balance of power in the mid-19th century---and again
in the four decades of calm that followed the 1870--71 Franco-Prussian
conflict. [The second period ended with WWI. So they misjudged
that]{.underline}. Could we also have misjudged the proximity of mass
conflict in the 21st century? Some say so. Security experts are
increasingly investigating scenarios where a stronger Russia on one side
and Europe\'s NATO allies on the other go from diplomatic tensions to
full on slapping each other. This, they stress, is unlikely. But if
global events have taught us anything, it\'s that unlikely doesn\'t mean
impossible. In fact, the above could happen in three simple steps. One:
Donald Trump makes good on his hints and pulls the US out of NATO. Two:
An emboldened Vladimir Putin decides to help himself to the Baltic
states---Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia---he has long believed should be
part of Russia. Three: Given these states have been NATO members since
2004, the rest of the alliance---the UK, Germany, France, and
others---go to their aid. The result? \"Hiroshimas and Nagasakis
everywhere,\" reckoned the Russian lawmaker Vladimir Zhirinovsky when
discussing the possibility last year. So that\'s not ideal. But [could
Russia and Europe really go to war?]{.underline} And if they did, how
would that work out? Be warned: As Keir Giles, associate fellow with the
UK foreign-policy think tank Chatham House, that is a nonprofit,
nongovernmental organization based in London tells me, \"There\'s not
much good news.\" 1. Tensions Rise **[Tensions between Russia and Europe
are always high]{.underline}**. Even so, the present unease is ominous.
On one hand, **[Russia has been holding major nuclear drills for 40
million citizens,]{.underline}** sending submarines into the territorial
waters of other nations and running mock bombing missions on the edge of
British airspace. Forcibly annexing part of another country, This
behavior isn\'t generally viewed as good neighborliness, either. Yet
NATO isn\'t entirely averse to mucking things up. The alliance has
almost 10,000 troops in countries that border Russia, while a two-week
war game featuring thousands of personnel and 50 aircrafts is being held
in Scotland right now. The enemy state in such rehearsals is often given
a somewhat unambiguous name: the Reds. 2. The Flash Point It\'s not
wildly anti-Russian to say the current administration favors the
countries that border the Baltic Sea---Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.
Putin believes these former Soviet states should never have become
independent: Each has a large Russian population and strategically
excellent sea ports. He\'s certainly not keen on them being NATO members
and sees the alliance---not without rationale---as encircling Russia.
\"If you compress a spring,\" he warned in 2014, \"eventually it will
snap back.\" With America gone, that snap back could happen instantly.
\"They would move on the Baltic states more or less immediately,\" says
Giles, who is also director of the Conflict Studies Research Center in
Oxfordshire. \"Putin believes Russian security requires the Baltic
states under its domain. But you need to look further. It\'s hard to put
a definitive border on how far ambitious Russians think the frontier
should expand. But certainly you\'re looking at Poland and Finland
too.\" 3. Internet Down! Shots Fired! In 2015, a study by research
institute the RAND Corporation concluded **[it would take just 60 hours
for Russia to overrun Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia]{.underline}**.
Giles, however, believes the signs would be there sometime in advance.
\"[There would be a noticeable rise in Russian diplomacy and media
focusing on issues that could give rationale for an armed
intervention]{.underline},\" he says. On some pretense, such as a
peacekeeping mission, [thousands of troops would gather on the
border]{.underline}. In the days before any invasion or attack, [the
target\'s internet would be shut down]{.underline} or disrupted by
specialist telecommunications soldiers. Power supplies would fail, and
ATMs would stop functioning. Cellphones and TV signals would be jammed.
Perhaps most ominously, personalized texts would be sent direct to
opposition officials, soldiers, and citizens, creating confusion and
panic. In some cases, these texts would appear to come from someone
already in the recipient\'s phone book. \"In the right circumstances,
this could be enough,\" says Giles. \"[Russia doesn\'t need to roll
tanks across a border. They can stage an attack without a military
presence. Misinformation and civil disorder could lead to regime change
with a client government of Moscow taking charge]{.underline}. That
would meet Russia\'s security and economic objectives.\" And if no such
regime change happened? Think hybrid warfare: all the above combined
with the sudden movement of troops into the country. \"We don\'t know
how exactly an occupation would look, but Russia does practice this
scenario,\" says Giles. \"What we do know is it would be over pretty
swiftly.\" 4. NATO: Fight or Fall Once diplomacy fails, the hard fact is
that a US-less NATO almost certainly doesn\'t have the firepower to win
a war with Russia. We\'ll ignore nuclear weapons for now and keep things
conventional. Russia has more men (the reserves alone are 2.5 million
strong) and hardware. As a single country, its chain of command is
better streamlined. Soldiers are battle-hardened from Ukraine and Syria.
After a decade of \$40 billion-a-year military upgrades, its
weaponry---such as the Pantsir-S1, a tank that can literally destroy
cruise missiles---is superior too. It\'s also possible some NATO members
would withdraw---in particular Turkey, given the warm relationship
between President Putin and President Recep Erdoğan. That\'s 600,000
men---the second-biggest contingent after the US---gone. The result
would be the last of NATO facing an existential decision: Fight and
probably lose, or, in this scenario, cut the Baltic states loose. Or, as
Ian Shield, associate lecturer in international relations at Anglia
Ruskin University, puts it: \"The choice would be between reneging on
the treaty---which would certainly lead to the disintegration of NATO
and probably, by extension, the whole European order---or participating
in a cataclysmic war extending up to nuclear weapons.\" Rock and a hard
place, basically. 5. War on the Ground Let\'s carry on gaming, though,
and say NATO engages Russia. How does that go? Not well for either side,
says Shields: \"On any battlefield, there would be
annihilation---although these wouldn\'t be battlefields like we have
previously known. Missiles and artillery have far greater range and
precision, meaning enemy posts, infrastructure, armories, and even
entire towns could be destroyed from within home territory. [What you
have is fewer individual battles but far greater destruction. If neither
side backed down, **entire swathes of Europe**---it\'s impossible to
know where---**would be reduced to rubble**]{.underline}. The death
tolls would be unimaginable.\" Britain wouldn\'t be safe; the English
Channel has become a hopelessly outdated moat. \"Russian aircrafts
wouldn\'t need to even enter British airspace,\" says Shields. \"They
could land precision strikes from well outside.\" Both sides would
wrestle for control of the seas around Scandinavia. [**Cyber attacks**,
meanwhile, could shut down transport infrastructure, hospitals, media,
and utilities]{.underline}. [Russia\'s main advantage]{.underline} amid
the carnage would be two-fold. First, [because it has more
weaponry]{.underline} and men, it can, essentially, keep blasting away
longer. [Second, its sheer landmass means it could better absorb the
devastation:]{.underline} NATO could wipe out every single structure
hundreds of miles into its adversary\'s territory, and Moscow wouldn\'t
even be scratched. 6. Going Nuclear As any history student knows, it
doesn\'t matter if you have 7,000 nuclear weapons (Russia) or 200
(Britain and France); their cataclysmic qualities level things up. [The
thought goes that the pressing of the red button means MAD: mutually
assured destruction]{.underline}. If one side starts throwing warheads
about, the other responds in kind. [Both adversaries are wiped out.
Right? Wrong.]{.underline} \"What [Russia has in its arsenal that the
West doesn\'t is tactical nuclear weapons]{.underline},\" explains
Giles. \"[These are not big city-leveling nukes, but ones that can
destroy battlefields]{.underline} or neighborhoods. The West had these
weapons but got rid of them. [So its **only response to a tactical
nuclear strike would be a full nuclear attack**.]{.underline} Which is
self-defeating because it would also ensure their own destruction. The
West is missing several rungs on the escalation ladder that Russia has
built into its strategy.\" Nonetheless, [once things go nuclear, it all
becomes unpredictable: **cities wiped out, millions dead**]{.underline}.
At this point, even the most advanced strategists tend to stop plotting
possible paths.

## 1NC Fill In DA -- China

**China is increasing it's market share as a result of US drone
restrictions**

**Grambrell & Shih 18** (Jon Grambrell, Gulf and Iran news director for
The Associated Press. Gerry Shih, former China correspondent for The
Associated Press. "US Navy still has technological edge, but Chinese
drones proliferating across Middle East," *NavyTimes*, October 3, 2018,
<https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2018/10/03/us-navy-still-has-technological-edge-but-chinese-drones-proliferating-across-middle-east/)///JP>

[Across the Middle East, **countries locked out of purchasing U.S.-made
drones** due to rules over excessive civilian casualties are being wooed
by Chinese arms dealers, who are world\'s main distributor of armed
drones.]{.underline}

[\"The Chinese product now doesn\'t lack technology, **it only lacks
market share**,\"]{.underline} said Song Zhongping, a Chinese military
analyst and former lecturer at the People\'s Liberation Army Rocket
Force University of Engineering. [\"And **the United States restricting
its arms exports is precisely what gives China a great
opportunity**.\"]{.underline}

The [sales are helping expand Chinese influence across a region vital to
American security interests.]{.underline}

[\"It\'s a hedging strategy and the Chinese will look to benefit from
that,\"]{.underline} said Douglas Barrie, an airpower specialist at the
International Institute for Strategic Studies. \"I think [the Chinese
are far less liable to be swayed by concerns over civilian
casualties]{.underline},\" he said.

At the start of the year, a satellite passing over southern Saudi Arabia
photographed U.S.-made surveillance drones at an airfield, alongside
Chinese-manufactured armed ones.

According to the Center for the Study of the Drone at New York\'s Bard
College, that was the first documented example of the two drone systems
being used in the war in Yemen. The country has emerged as a \"sort of a
testing ground for these strike-capable drones,\" said Dan Gettinger,
the co-director of the Center for the Study of the Drone. \"There\'s a
rapid turnaround from delivery to deployment.\"

U.S. drones were first used in Yemen to kill suspected al-Qaida
militants in 2002.

One of the biggest Chinese exports is the Cai-Hong, or Rainbow, series
made by the state-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp., or
CASC, the largest contractor for the Chinese space program.

[CASC\'s CH-4 and CH-5 models are on a par with San Diego-based General
Atomics\' Predator and Reaper drones, and much cheaper]{.underline}.
Independent analysts say [the Chinese models lag behind their American
counterparts but the technology is good enough to justify the price tag,
which might be half or less.]{.underline}

A CASC executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not
authorized to talk to journalists, said cutting-edge U.S. models like
Boeing Co.\'s Stingray, introduced this year for the U.S. Navy, still
hold a technological advantage.

And [while price is an advantage, so too is **a more relaxed attitude
toward how drones are used**]{.underline}, said Ulrike Franke, an expert
on drones and policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign
Relations.

Since 2014, [China has sold more than 30 CH-4′s to countries including
Saudi Arabia and Iraq in deals worth over \$700 million, according to
CASC. Ten countries are currently in negotiations to purchase the CH-4,
according to the firm.]{.underline}

Last year, [China sold to the UAE the Wing Loong II, an armed unmanned
aerial vehicle roughly equivalent to the American MQ-9
Reaper.]{.underline}

\"In recent years, [all types of drones have proven their value and
importance through a high degree of use in warfare, and the military has
noticed,\"]{.underline} said the top CASC executive. \"**[Many countries
are now speeding up the development for these weapons systems, including
China.\"]{.underline}**

During President Xi Jinping's five years in power, China has stepped up
spending on stealth fighters and aircraft carriers for its own military,
while boosting sales of advanced equipment such as attack submarines to
close allies like Pakistan.

[China still lags behind the U.S., Russia, France, and Germany in total
arms sales but **it\'s catching up.** Chinese arms exports rose by 38
percent between 2008-12 and 2013-17]{.underline}, according to the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which tracks the
global arms trade.

**Chinese drones sales are not compliant with the MTCR -- this destroys
any effectiveness of the MTCR**

**Spector 18** (Leonard S. Spector is executive director of the
Washington office of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation
Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at

Proliferation Challenges," *Arms Control Association*, April, 2018,
https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2018-04/features/missile-technology-control-regime-shifting-proliferation-challenges)///JP

[From the standpoint of the MTCR, the greatest current challenges are
similarly focused on Iran and North Korea]{.underline}, namely
restricting their global procurement activities in support of their
ballistic missile programs [and, in particular, support for those
programs provided by entities in China.]{.underline}

[MTCR states are pursuing what might be called the "classic" technology
denial strategy to constrain the leakage of technology to the two states
of concern.]{.underline} This strategy includes intensified scrutiny of
export licenses, heightened attention by customs officials at border
crossings and ports, promotion of industry internal compliance programs,
and the like. Such a strategy also includes engagement with transit
states to counter their use by Iranian and North Korean procurement
networks to disguise the ultimate destination of smuggled
missile-relevant goods. Also supporting MTCR goals, the United States
under the Proliferation Security Initiative has built a network of
states ready to assist in interdicting suspect cargoes while in
transit.[24](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2018-04/features/missile-technology-control-regime-shifting-proliferation-challenges#endnote24)

[Despite these substantial efforts, the missile capabilities of Iran and
North Korea have grown steadily, in part through clandestine bilateral
collaboration that is largely beyond the reach of the just-noted control
mechanisms.]{.underline}

China's Role

[**Transfers of missile technology from China to states of concern is
adding to these challenges**. Such transfers have posed a decades-long
quandary requiring particular attention]{.underline}. As former
Assistant Secretary of State for Nonproliferation Robert Einhorn and
Gary Samore, former senior director for nonproliferation on the U.S.
National Security Council staff, wrote in 2002,

[China pledged to halt missile exports in 1992, 1994, 1998, and 2000. In
the mid- and late 1990s, Beijing also passed laws on and strengthened
bureaucratic oversight of its export controls]{.underline}. In spite of
these steps, [Chinese firms continued to transfer missile-related
industrial technology to Iran, Libya, North Korea, Pakistan, and
Syria.]{.underline} [In August 2002]{.underline}, however, because of
increased recognition of the threat that WMD posed to its own security,
and after further talks with the United States, [Beijing published a
missile export control list that corresponded closely to the MTCR
guidelines.[25](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2018-04/features/missile-technology-control-regime-shifting-proliferation-challenges#endnote25)]{.underline}

**[Exports of Chinese missile-related goods to countries of concern
continued]{.underline}**, however, and [in May 2003 the United States
sanctioned China North Industries Corp. for transferring missile
technology to Iran. Additionally, in September 2004, Washington imposed
sanctions on the Chinese company Xinshidai, also reported as exporting
missile-relevant equipment to
Iran.[26](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2018-04/features/missile-technology-control-regime-shifting-proliferation-challenges#endnote26)]{.underline}
Since this period, Washington has repeatedly imposed sanctions against
other Chinese firms for assisting the Iranian and North Korean missile
programs.[27](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2018-04/features/missile-technology-control-regime-shifting-proliferation-challenges#endnote27)
Still, [U.S. sanctioning of Chinese firms supporting the North Korean
nuclear and missile program has continued, with the most recent
sanctions imposed in August and September
2017.[28](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2018-04/features/missile-technology-control-regime-shifting-proliferation-challenges#endnote28)]{.underline}

[U.S. officials hesitate to accuse Beijing of pursuing a deliberate
national policy of supporting missile programs in states of
concern]{.underline}. Rather, [they state that China is committed to
implementing strategic trade controls but lacks the ability to
effectively enforce these rules]{.underline}, given the vast scale of
commercial activity conducted by Chinese
entities.[29](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2018-04/features/missile-technology-control-regime-shifting-proliferation-challenges#endnote29)
Nonetheless, [the history of leakage of sensitive technology from China
to North Korea and Iran over so many years leaves many questions
unanswered regarding Beijing's flawed implementation of its export
control system.]{.underline}

#### China is expanding drone sales now -- the result is prolif of WMD capable drones

**Smith 18** (R. Jeffrey Smith, Managing editor of national security at
Public Integrity, "The world may soon be awash in advanced, lethal
drones," June 18, 2018,
https://publicintegrity.org/national-security/the-world-may-soon-be-awash-in-advanced-lethal-drones/)///JP

[U.S. military forces face a growing threat from sophisticated and often
deadly drones, due to the broad proliferation of related weapons and
surveillance technologies that until recently have largely been in the
hands of friendly countries]{.underline}, according to a new report
prepared for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

The global spread of these technologies was supposed to be controlled by
a system of export controls created by the West to block the spread of
advanced missiles, but that system has failed to obstruct the
development of drones that have potent surveillance and destructive
power by potential American adversaries, the report says.

[Countries like China, Russia, Iran, and even the United Arab Emirates
are not only producing lethal drones but in some cases exporting both
the drones and their underlying technologies.]{.underline}

[While the most capable military drones have been used by only around
ten countries until now, that number is about to expand,]{.underline}
analysts at the RAND Corporation state in their 70-page report to Marine
Gen. Joseph Dunford, Jr., the Joint Chiefs chairman.

[China is building a factory in Saudi Arabia meant to produce CH-4
drones that can loiter for at least 14 hours while carrying antiarmor
missiles and heat sensors, and is offering to erect drone factories
elsewhere, such as Pakistan and Myanmar,]{.underline} the report notes.
[China may also use the factory to make better CH-5 drones capable of
carrying precision-guided missiles for as long as 39 hours.]{.underline}

In an illustration of how routine such deployments have become, Chinese
CH-4s are already stationed at the Saudi's Jirzan Regional airport, near
U.S. Predator drones owned by UAE that are operating from the same
airbase, according to satellite photos analyzed by experts at Bard
College. The Emirates, meanwhile, are selling drones of their own to
Russia while also offering coproduction opportunities to other
countries. Germany and possibly Italy are moving towards the production
and export of similar advanced drones.

"The proliferation of large UAVs \[unmanned aerial vehicles\] is
accelerating," said the June 14 report, "Assessment of the Proliferation
of Certain Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems," which was ordered by
Congress.

[The size of these drones gives them the capability to carry weapons of
mass destruction, such as nuclear, chemical, or biological
weapons.]{.underline} But RAND's Cyber and Intelligence Policy Center,
which did the study for the Pentagon, says those uses are less likely
than simply conducting advanced surveillance of U.S. forces before the
outbreak of war.

Large drones are especially useful in monitoring the movement of troops
and equipment near coastlines or borders, and at sea, or keeping track
of "personnel and equipment readiness" on the eve of conflict, the
report said. Drones of this type -- like the Predator, Reaper and Global
Hawk used by the United States for years in the Middle East and Africa
--- "can carry larger sensors, providing better data and longer standoff
distance, and can carry more munitions," the report said.

[Until recently, only Israel and the United States exported such
advanced drones, and only to countries that respected the missile
technology control regime.]{.underline} In total, Washington has
approved the sale of 103 such drones, but only three countries -- Italy,
Spain and the United Kingdom -- have gotten armed versions.

[China picked up the slack, however, when U.S. and Israeli sales to
Jordan, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia were blocked under the export control
rules, the report notes. China has sold two of its advanced drones to at
least nine nations, **including these disappointed U.S.
suitors.**]{.underline}

#### Beating China and Russia now

**Soergel, 12-27-16** (Andrew Soergel, Senior Reporter at U.S. News
Wolld Report, specializing in international relations with the United
States. "America\'s Arms Exports Dominate Despite Global Competition",
US News) //GB

[America\'s market share in the developing world is larger than
any]{.underline} other country, but it is being increasingly threatened
by Russian exports. Between 2012 and 2015, the U.S. accounted for just
33 percent of all arms transfer agreements with the developing world,
according to the Congressional Research Service report. Russia was
involved in nearly 19 percent of such agreements and has made concerted
efforts to improve its arms trade standing with developing nations.

\"[Russia has increased its sales efforts]{.underline} in Latin America,
with a principal focus on Venezuela,\" Theohary wrote. \"Russia has
adopted more flexible payment arrangements, including loans, for its
prospective customers in the developing world generally, including a
willingness in specific cases to forgive outstanding debts owed to it by
a prospective client in order to secure new arms purchases.\"

[China has also made inroads as a weapons exporter to the developing
world]{.underline}, particularly to Pakistan and some African nations.

But [the report suggests the U.S. is likely to \"hold its position as
the principal supplier to key developing world nations, especially with
those able to afford major new weapons.\" It notes that the \"especially
large and diverse base of arms equipment clients]{.underline}\" the U.S.
has maintained since the Cold War \"[provides a steady stream of orders
from year to year.\"]{.underline}

Similarly, [a separate SIPRI study]{.underline} published earlier this
month, which examines all sales, transfers and gifts of major weapons in
2016 and thus profiles a larger share of the international weapons
market than the Congressional Research Service report[, also paints a
picture of American arms industry dominance]{.underline}.

[That report showed total weapons sales of the world\'s 100 largest
military equipment companies]{.underline} clocked in at nearly \$371
billion during 2015. [American companies like Lockheed Martin, Boeing
and Raytheon accounted for nearly \$210 billion, or nearly 57
percent]{.underline}, of that total. Forty-three of the 100 largest
military companies profiled by the institute are U.S.-based.

#### US outpacing Russia now

**SIPRI**, 3-11-**2019**, (Stockholm International Peace Research

(CB)

[US arms exports grew by 29 per cent between 2009--13 and 2014--18, and
the US share of total global exports rose from 30 per cent to 36 per
cent]{.underline}. The gap between the top two arms-exporting states
also increased: [US exports of major arms were 75 per cent higher than
Russia's in 2014--18, while they were only 12 per cent higher in
2009--13]{.underline}. [More than half (52 per cent) of US arms exports
went to the Middle East in 2014--18.]{.underline}

'[The USA has further solidified its position as the world's leading
arms supplier]{.underline},' [says]{.underline} Dr Aude Fleurant,
[Director of the SIPRI Arms and Military Expenditure
Programme]{.underline}. '[The USA exported arms to at least 98 countries
in the past five years]{.underline}; these deliveries often included
advanced weapons such as combat aircraft, short-range cruise and
ballistic missiles, and large numbers of guided bombs.'

[Arms exports by Russia decreased by 17 per cent between 2009--13 and
2014--18, in particular due to the reduction in arms imports by India
and Venezuela]{.underline}. Between 2009--13 and 2014--18 France
increased its arms exports by 43 per cent and Germany by 13 per cent.
[The combined arms exports of European Union member states accounted for
27 per cent of global arms exports in 2014--18.]{.underline}

A small number of countries outside Europe and North America are large
arms exporters. China was the fifth largest arms exporter in 2014--18.
Whereas Chinese arms exports rose by 195 per cent between 2004--2008 and
2009--13, they increased by only 2.7 per cent between 2009--13 and
2014--18. Israeli, South Korean and Turkish arms exports increased
substantially---60 per cent, 94 per cent and 170 per cent,
respectively---between 2009--13 and 2014--18.

#### US is beating Russia

**Bowler**, 5-10-**2018** (Tim Bowler, Business Reporter at BBC, \"Which
country dominates the global arms trade?,\" BBC News,
<https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43873518>) (CB)

Brutal [civil wars in Syria and Yemen]{.underline}, [coupled with the
return of]{.underline} great power [rivalries between the US, Russia and
China]{.underline}, [have brought the world\'s arms trade into sharp
focus.]{.underline}

And unsurprisingly it is a thriving global industry, with the total
international trade in arms now worth about \$100bn (£74bn) per year,
Pieter Wezeman, senior researcher at the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute (Sipri), tells the BBC.

In its latest figures, the defence industry think tank says that [major
weapons sales in the five years to 2017 were 10% higher than in
2008-12.](https://www.sipri.org/publications/2018/sipri-fact-sheets/trends-international-arms-transfers-2017)

And [it is the United States that is extending its lead as the globe\'s
number one arms exporter]{.underline}, adds Sipri.

It estimates that [the US now accounts for 34% of all global arms sales,
up from 30% five years ago, and are now at their highest level since the
late 1990s.]{.underline}

\"The US has been open to supplying arms to a large variety of
recipients, and there are a large number of countries ready to acquire
weapons from the US,\" says Mr Wezeman.

[The US\'s arms exports are 58% higher than those of
Russia]{.underline}, the world\'s second-largest exporter[. And while US
arms exports grew by 25% in 2013-17 compared with 2008-12, Russia\'s
exports fell by 7.1% over the same period.]{.underline}

It is Middle East states that have been among the US\'s biggest
customers - Saudi Arabia tops the list - with the region as a whole
accounting for almost half of US arms exports during 2013-17.

#### Russia's global arms export share is decreasing-- the gap between U.S. and Russian arms sales is widening

**Brokeš** 4/29/**19** (Filip Brokeš is an analyst and a journalist
specializing in international relations. "Russia's declining arms
exports," *Central European Financial Observer*, 4/29/19,
<https://financialobserver.eu/cse-and-cis/russias-declining-arms-exports/>)
//Haus

According to the world-renowned Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute (SIPRI) [Russian exports of major arms decreased by 17 per
cent between 2009-13 and 2014-18.]{.underline}

In SIPRI's latest report titled "Trends in International Arms Transfers,
2018" [Russia is still the world's second largest arms exporter, but the
gap between Russia and the United States has been widening]{.underline}
in recent years. While the US arms exports grew by 29 per cent between
the two periods, increasing share of total global arms exports from 30
per cent to 36 per cent, [Russian share of the global arms exports
market decreased from 27 per cent to 21 per cent]{.underline}, according
to the report. [The fall in Russia's global arms export share is, in
part, the result of]{.underline} general [reductions in]{.underline}
arms [imports by Russia's long term major arms import partners --- India
and Venezuela.]{.underline}

"Although India remained the chief recipient of Russian arms in 2014-18,
Russian arms exports to India fell by 42 per cent between 2014-18 and
2009-13. Arms exports to Venezuela, which was the fifth largest
recipient of Russian arms in 2009-13, decreased by 96 per cent between
the two periods," the report says. The decreasing demand for arms by
India has hit Russia particularly hard. According to the report, India's
import of arms decreased by 23 per cent between 2009-13 and 2014-18.

"The decline in India's import is also partly due to delays in
deliveries of arms produced under license from foreign suppliers, such
as combat aircraft ordered from Russian in 2001 and submarines ordered
from France in 2008," according to the India's daily Business Today. In
the period between 2009-13, Russia accounted for 76 per cent of total
Indian arms imports, compared with 58 per cent in 2014-18.

Besides India and Venezuela, between 2014-18, Russia delivered major
arms to 46 countries. [More than half of Russia's overall arms exports
went to only three countries]{.underline}: [China, India and
Algeria]{.underline}. "At the regional level, Asia and Oceania accounted
for 60 per cent of Russian arms exports in 2014--18, Africa for 17 per
cent, the Middle East for 16 per cent, Europe for 5.8 per cent and the
Americas for 1.4 per cent," the report says.

#### The US is defense industry is fine now, but Russia can catch up 

**Wolfgang 18** (Ben Wolfgang covers the Pentagon, military and foreign
affairs for The Washington Times, 12-8-2018, \"Russia overtakes U.K., is
now No. 2 in global arms industry,\" Washington Times,
https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/dec/10/russia-overtakes-uk-is-now-no-2-in-global-arms-ind//KDES).

[While the U.S. remains the world's clear leader, Russia is making major
strides in arms sales and last year passed the U.K. to become the
world's second-largest weapons producer, according to a comprehensive
new study examining top international arms companies.]{.underline}

[The detailed report from the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute (SIPRI) found a huge jump in the production and sales of
Russian arms companies in 2017, accounting for nearly 10 percent of the
entire global market.]{.underline} The SIPRI study looked at the world's
top 100 arms-production companies and ranked nations based on those
companies' growth and sales figures.

[Analysts said the jump is the direct result of increased spending by
Moscow on military modernization, creating a fertile sales climate for
Russian arms companies]{.underline}.

["Russian companies have experienced significant growth in their arms
sales since 2011," said Siemon Wezeman, a senior researcher with SIPRI.
"This is in line with Russia's increased spending on arms procurement to
modernize its armed forces."]{.underline}

[Ten Russian companies are listed in SIPRI's list of the top 100 global
arms manufacturers]{.underline}. The combined arms sales of those 10
companies rose 8.5 percent from 2016 to 2017, hitting \$37.7 billion
last year.

The top 100 arms companies worldwide had combined sales of \$398.2
billion, the report found.

The growth in Russian sales catapulted the country past the U.K., which
had been the world's No. 2 arms producer since 2002. The U.K. remains
the largest weapons producer in Europe and had seven companies listed in
the top 10 worth \$35.7 billion in sales.

[But the U.S., not surprisingly, remains by far the world's leader. The
U.S. has 42 companies in the top 100 globally, the SIPRI study said,
accounting for 57 percent of total arms sales worldwide, or about \$226
billion.]{.underline}

[Lockheed Martin remained the world's largest producer, with 2017 sales
of about \$45 billion. Lockheed and other top U.S. companies are
routinely awarded lucrative Pentagon contracts.]{.underline}

["U.S. companies directly benefit from the U.S. Department of Defense's
ongoing demand for weapons,' said]{.underline} Aude Fleurant, director
of SIPRI's Arms and Military Expenditure Programme.

"The gap between Lockheed Martin and Boeing --- the two largest arms
producers in the world --- increased from \$11 billion in 2016 to \$18
billion in 2017," Ms. Fleurant continued.

Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs, said on
Aug. 8 at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

"I can assure you that my colleagues and I at the State Department, but
also again more broadly in the USG, will continue exploring ways to cut
red tape and give U.S. industry every advantage in an increasingly
competitive global marketplace, while continuing to ensure the
responsible export of arms." "[Which are]{.underline}, namely, [to
preserve peace]{.underline} through strength by reforming regulations to
facilitate the exports of U.S. military equipment; [to strengthen
partners and allies]{.underline}; [to facilitate U.S. economic security
and innovation]{.underline}." Under the new policy, [the United States
hopes to make its export bureaucracy more proactive]{.underline} and cut
red tape in the process. "These steps are among the first in what we
hope will be a series of efforts to streamline the arms transfer
process," Kaidanow said.

[The United States is making these policy changes with great power
competition with China and Russia in mind.]{.underline} "[We're trying
to improve our ability to compete with our adversaries by providing our
partners with viable alternatives to foreign products in order to
maintain influence in key regions]{.underline} throughout the world,"
Laura Cressey, Deputy Director for Regional Security and Arms Transfers
at U.S. Department of State, said.

#### Russia and China would fill in 

**Schwartz 18'** (Benjamin Schwartz is the Executive Director of the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Defense and Aerospace Export Council and
formerly served in the Office of the Secretary of Defense.
"Strengthening the economy at home and U.S. military partnerships
abroad". Article from The Hill.
https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/393565-strengthening-the-economy-at-home-and-us-military)

The U.S. Congress exercises an essential oversight function by requiring
the U.S. Department of State to notify America's elected representatives
of all significant military equipment intended for export, but it is now
time for Congress to be informed of all denials of major defense export
requests as well.

The current notification requirement allows Congress to monitor, and at
times intervene, on pending arms sales to ensure such arms exports
serves American interests. These interests include preventing an arms
race, averting the proliferation and risks associated with weapons of
mass destruction (WMD), avoiding human rights abuses, and encouraging
military balances among countries that promote peace and freedom around
the world.

This arrangement has served the United States well during a period when
American industry exercised extensive control over global defense and
aerospace markets, preventing or substantially delaying the
proliferation of a wide range of defense technologies through export
restrictions.

[Today, however, global market conditions are considerably different.
America's defense and aerospace industry is faced with significant
competition, and its dominance in a variety of critical defense
technologies is under threat. As a result, restrictions on U.S. arms
exports can now accelerate non-U.S. manufacturing, indirectly promoting
advanced defense capabilities to be transferred abroad.]{.underline}

In certain ways, [counter-proliferation policies now encourage
proliferation. As a Pentagon official in the Office of the Secretary of
Defense,]{.underline} [I witnessed multiple cases of the U.S. government
denying foreign partners' requests for American defense products, only
to have those countries acquire the same or similar capabilities from
another source. In a number of instances, the U.S. government would
reverse its denial in time, but by then it was too late. The sale and
opportunity to partner with the foreign government had been lost, and
instead, a market had been opened to stimulate foreign defense
manufacturing.]{.underline}

[Increasingly, when American industry is forced to abandon these
markets, the **gap is filled by Russian and Chinese companies, and their
presence inhibits future American defense industrial partnerships
because of counter-intelligence concerns**. One export denial creates a
cascade of future denials. Alarmingly, policies aimed at preventing the
spread of WMD delivery systems are now encouraging foreign countries to
turn to Chinese capabilities that do not come with the monitoring
requirements that mitigate the risk of WMD use or loss of
control.]{.underline}

As the U.S. Congress evaluates American interests associated with arms
exports moving forward, it ought to also consider measures that will
help avert promoting rival defense manufacturers through export
restrictions. There are times when it is in America's interest to deny
defense exports to a country --- even when that country will respond by
purchasing the same or a similar capability from another foreign
supplier. Diplomatic, strategic, and ethical considerations are
reasonable grounds to justify export denials. But there ought to be a
transparent, reviewable record to ensure that the economic and strategic
implications of export denials are taken into account. A historical
record would also be a valuable decision-making resource, enabling
policymakers to use past cases and trend analysis to inform future
decisions.

Every export denial of major defense equipment should be accompanied by
a written assessment of the economic consequences. The assessment should
gauge the likelihood of an end user receiving the same or similar
capability from an alternative source, as well as the estimated effect
on American jobs. Because exports decrease the per-unit cost of
acquisitions by the U.S. military through economies of scale, these
impact statements ought to assess costs to the U.S. military department
that manages the defense item under review. Maintaining a healthy U.S.
defense industrial base and sustaining American leadership in emerging
technologies will require serious and sustained consideration of these
factors and more.

[The U.S. government is capable of producing these assessments, and the
end product will be better if American industry has an opportunity to
share its own data. Companies have a vested interest in understanding
competitors and market trends to a degree that government officials do
not. In export review decisions, American industry should have an
opportunity to make a case before regulators through mechanisms that
ensure industry input will be a factor, even if not the decisive factor,
in export review decisions.]{.underline}

Institutionalizing such consideration of the economic and strategic
implications of arms export restrictions is a prudent and practical step
that can strengthen America's economy at home and our military
relationships abroad.

#### Russia and China will fill-in for US arms sales

**Inanc, 10-28-18** (Yusuf Selman Inanc, journalist at the Daily Sabah
Middle East, a Turkish daily journal covering politics across the Middle
East "Arms sales to Saudi Arabia more than money, rather a sign of
political might", Daily Sabah Middle East) //GB

[One main concern in the West about halting arms sales is the fact that
Russia and China are ready to sell weapons without commenting on any
action targeting human rights. The U.S. is concerned that Russia\'s arms
delivery to any country accounts for more than half of Saudi Arabia\'s
arms imports, according to research group IHS Markit.]{.underline} The
same group has documented that arms sales by the U.S. amounted to \$7.3
billion last year, while it was less than \$2 billion a decade ago.
Therefore, the U.S. believes the sale of arms is an important factor in
keeping Riyadh on its side.

Similar to this concern, [regarding Russia and China, Saudi Arabia
cannot be lost by the West as Riyadh explicitly opposes Iran and its
actions in the Middle East]{.underline}. Both the U.S. and its main ally
in the region, Israel, consider Iran as a threat; thus, Saudi Arabia is
essential for the struggle against Tehran.

#### Russia and China fill in -- kills US influence

\"U.S. Arms Transfer Policy: Shaping the Way Ahead,\" No Publication,
https://www.csis.org/analysis/us-arms-transfer-policy-shaping-way-ahead//ALiang

And first of all, I'd like to put in context the Defense and Aerospace
Export Council, which was recently launched a few months ago, in April,
at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, is a unique opportunity capitalizing on
the administration's interest in moving forward with CAT policy changes
to put forward a brand-new council at the Chamber that's focused on
influencing the government -- both U.S. government and foreign
governments -- and working with our industrial sector to advance
opportunities for industries globally. And it's an honor for me to be
part of that initiative. And my executive director, Ben Schwartz, is
here in the front row as well. As Andrew kindly pointed out, I have a
little bit of experience -- roughly 33 years of experience in [this very
issue of arms transfer and cooperative research and development work
with friends and allies globally. And what has changed in that 33 years
is that the United States and its industries, although having incredibly
capable military equipment, is not the only game in town. We are seeing
the emergence of the Chinese and their military-industrial complex. And
we're also seeing Russia continue to advance some of its capabilities in
the global market, as well as others -- friends and allies -- who have
created military-industrial complexes]{.underline}. So when I started in
this business 33 years ago, we had a very strong corner on the market
for advanced military capability. That is no longer the case today. So
there is a paradigm shift. Specific to the CAT changes, we at this
council at the Chamber are welcoming of the economic impact
considerations as an element of the arms transfer review process. In my
33 years, it's the first time that the policy has been expanded to
include this consideration -- the economic impact. It is not an
overarching consideration, but it is allowed now to be a credible
component of consideration in transfers. We also encourage consideration
of foreign availability as an element of the arms transfer review
process. [As we are witnessing China -- as an example, not alone -- but
China filling voids the U.S. left with a denial to a friend or ally. The
consequence of a denial filled by China or others is as follows: The
U.S. loses market share that is not easily recaptured, and in some cases
will never be recaptured. The U.S. loses control of the capability. The
U.S. loses the opportunity to train, influence, and maintain a military
relationship with foreign forces, who now are introducing into their
inventory a Chinese -- Korean, Israeli, et cetera --
capability]{.underline}. And finally, with the introduction of, let's
say, Chinese or Russian system into the military inventory of that
friend or ally, we now have a far more complicated future arms transfer
decision process that is now compounded by a prior U.S. denial . And in
some instances, we complicate the potential for expanded diplomatic
relations. Let me explain how -- what I mean here. India. Let's take
India as an example. I've worked very closely with India over the recent
years for Dr. Carter. Years ago we denied AESA radar for the MMRCA jet
competition, fighter competition several years ago, and the French
clinched the deal. Now I like the French. Don't get me wrong. But I like
American industry better. Now, several years later -- and I worked this
initiative with Dr. Carter; we're Johnny-come-lately to the effort --
for additional aircraft capability in India. And now we're all in. We've
revised our policies. AESA's possible, coproduction, production of
aircraft and making it in India is possible. But we are behind now
because the French bid us out. Another example [with India, we never
answered India's request for ballistic missile defense capability. That
ask of the U.S. went unanswered for a number of years. And now, India
has been forced to consider and has -- may potentially go buy,
potentially, the Russian S-400 system.]{.underline} Similar to what
Turkey's buying- - or said they were going to buy. Now we are rushing to
put together a proposal for BMD for India to counter that situation. And
why is that a problem for us? We have legislation on the Hill in 2017,
CAATSA, which penalizes friends and allies who lean towards Russian
equipment specifically. Fortunately there's been a congressional carve
out for India, but it created a lot of anxiety. So NDAA 2019, the
National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2019, is headed to
the president. And we at the chamber, and on this council, Defense
Aerospace Export Council, are encouraged with the language is Section
1752 that reinforces economic consideration in this review process, and
also requires, as well, the consideration of foreign availability -- a
recommendation that we published in 30 proposals to the administration
on June 8th. So we're excited about the language in NDAA 2019.

### 2NC Fill In DA-Russia-Drones Links

#### China will fill in for drones

**Middle East Eye, 3-29-17** (Middle East Eye, London-based online news
outlet covering events in the Middle East. According to its official
website, MEE is an \"independently funded online news organization that
was founded in 2014. "China\'s Saudi drone factory compensates for US
ban", Middle East Eye) //GB

[Saudi Arabia has become the world\'s second-largest arms
importer]{.underline}, yet [the United States]{.underline}, its closest
ally and main exporter of arms, refuses to sell its Predator and Reaper
drones, which go only to a small number of European nations.  The Saudis
also felt incensed when last December then-US President Barack Obama
blocked an arms shipment to Saudi Arabia after concerns were raised in
Congress over civilian casualties in the Saudi-led war in Yemen. The
Saudis also felt incensed when last December then-US President Barack
Obama blocked an arms shipment to Saudi Arabia after concerns were
raised in Congress over civilian casualties in the Saudi-led war in
Yemen.

This is despite the US waging a controversial drone campaign to take out
what it sees as suspected al-Qaeda targets in Yemen for more than a
decade. [Saudi has since turned to China,]{.underline} which unlike the
US, is not signatory to the international Arms Trade Treaty (ATT)
[and]{.underline} so [has fewer restrictions on the sale of drone
technology.]{.underline}

[Chinese drones are cheaper to]{.underline}o. The [CH-4 costs \$4m while
a low-end Chinese drone can cost about \$1m.]{.underline} On the other
hand, American Reaper drones can cost in excess of \$17m. Added to this
a slump in world oil prices and [it\'s easier to see why the CH-4 has
become the killer drone]{.underline} of choice for countries [across the
Middle East]{.underline}. The CH-4 has a range of about 3,500km and can
carry the AR-1 precision-guided missile that can hit a distant target
with a margin of error of less than 1.5 metres.

At the launch last month of a report assessing the military and defence
capabilities of countries around the world, John Chipman, [director of
the International Institute of Strategic Studies, was cited]{.underline}
by AFP as saying that \"[an emerging threat for deployed Western forces
is that with China looking to sell more abroad]{.underline}, [they may
confront more advanced military systems, in more places, and operated by
a broader range of adversaries]{.underline}.\"

//Haus

The long term security goals Russia normally pursues

[The Russia--China arms trade relationship]{.underline}, however, [is
not a unique case. Russia\'s arms trade activities with other countries
in East Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East are also clearly oriented,
primarily, towards advancing its national security interests. It
furthers these interests by utilizing its military exports to achieve a
set of foreign and defense policy objectives.]{.underline}

First and foremost, [Russia uses its military exports to support its
image as a global power. Russia considers its position as the
second-largest arms exporter in the world to be critically
important.]{.underline} The extent of Russia\'s arms sales and its
relationships to customers helps measure (in its own eyes as well as in
others\') its international standing (Blank and Kim \[11\]). Putin
stated in a speech to the FSTVS (Federal Service for Military-Technical
Cooperation), \"That Russia is the world\'s second biggest arms and
military hardware exporter is thus all the greater an achievement. I
think it is an important indicator of our country\'s industrial,
technological, scientific, and political capabilities\" (Putin \[29\]).
Part of the concept behind Putin\'s modernization of the Russian
Military (particularly, its Air Force and air defense systems) is not
only increasing the absolute and relative effectiveness of the Russian
Armed Forces, but also maintaining and improving its position as the
main competitor to the West for the export of high-technology military
systems. Therefore, [Putin seeks to re-establish Russian geopolitical
influence by reinforcing its reputation as one of the world\'s largest
producers and exporters of modern weaponry and military
equipment.]{.underline}

[This is a particular concern for Russia in East Asia. The rise of Asian
powers and their role in the arms trade are fueling competition for
Russia and is aggravating insecurity throughout Asia. Russia now risks
losing its market share in India and elsewhere. If Russia fails to meet
its own needs by producing competitive weapons for itself]{.underline}
(let alone its customers abroad), [it must then import systems from the
West, leading to a decline in its status.]{.underline} A meeting of
experts at the Oriental Studies Institute of the Russian Academy of
Sciences noted that [Russia is losing out in the competition for Indian
contracts in high technology, a very disturbing indicator given India\'s
importance in Russian arms sales and foreign policy]{.underline} (Blank
and Kim \[11\]). There have been many more pubic indications of similar
concerns since then. Thus, [a key element of Russia\'s status and
influence in the region is its position as one of the dominant arms
providers.]{.underline} From the Russian perspective, [if that position
and reputation degrade due to the rise of East Asian economic power and
modernization, its overall influence in the region will be
endangered.]{.underline}

Second, [Russia sees its arms trade as a cornerstone of its ability to
maintain an independent foreign policy in Asia and the Middle East. For
Russia, an independent defense sector]{.underline} not only lowers unit
costs and assists indigenous technological innovation, but also [enables
an independent foreign policy.]{.underline} As aforementioned, the
export of arms is generally one of the best ways to achieve this
self-sufficiency. For Russia\'s leadership, [every new arms contract
made, and every military-technical cooperation relationship built, is a
strengthening of this independence, and every lost contract and
relationship is a slight weakening of its independence. Should Russia
lose too much ground in the military exports field, and by implication
in its ability to be a militarily competitive and independent actor, it
will come under increasing pressure to align itself with either the East
(China) or the West (Europe and the United States) and yield some if not
most of that independence]{.underline} (Blank and Kim \[11\]). [If it
loses that defense industry independence, it will not be able to exploit
all the rivalries that its ability to sell arms to East and South Asian
states now allows it]{.underline} (Blank and Kim \[11\]). Thus,
[Russia\'s capacity for]{.underline} autarchic and independent [action
will increase or diminish commensurate to the extent of those sales and
the defense industry\'s competitiveness. As such, the independence of
its defense industry is not only an economic factor for Russia, but is
also an essential element of its ability to practice an independent
foreign policy.]{.underline}

Third, [Russia utilizes its military exports to initiate and strengthen
its relations with other countries, particularly allies, in regions
where it wants influence, such as Asia and the Middle East. Each time a
transfer relationship is fostered, it implies political and military
links between the exporter and the recipient with the increased number
of import links held by a state reflective of its overall participation
within the global security system]{.underline} (Blank and Kim \[11\]).
To this end, [increased export links are reflective of the political
effects of globalization as much as, if not more than, the economic
effects]{.underline} (Blank and Kim \[11\]). For many states, but
particularly Russia, [military exports are a means of directly
influencing another state\'s ability to deter and defend itself and its
interests.]{.underline} This view is clearly held by the Russia
Government leadership, as shown when then Vice Premier Dmitri Rogozin
(\[36\]) stated,

The FSVTS at the moment is, it can be said, the country\'s second
foreign policy agency, a second MID (Ministry of Foreign affairs), a
second Smolensk square, because it strengthens what the diplomats do
today, not just in political terms, but rather authenticated in metal,
treaty relations, contracts, maintenance services, equipment repair, and
its maintenance in a suitable state.

[From Russia\'s perspective, when it seeks military export contracts, it
is not simply searching for a consumer with a need, but is quite
literally inserting weaponry and military technologies into a region to
gain or increase its influence there.]{.underline} Rogozin (\[36\])
indicated that this is Russia\'s stance when he said, \"They (the FSVTS)
trade arms only with friends and partners.\" [Arms sales are one of
Russia\'s critical tools for building relationships in regions where it
has interests.]{.underline}

[Russia perceives trends in arms sales and the defense industry to be
crucial to achieving a great power position in Asia, if not
globally.]{.underline} Since 2008, Asia is an ever greater Russian
priority. [If Russia fails to compete with its rivals in arms sales to
Asia, it will lose ground regionally and globally]{.underline} (Blank
and Kim \[11\]). Therefore, [Russia targets East Asia for it military
exports not only because there is tremendous current demand for arms in
region, but also because it is a geostrategic necessity. Due to the
enormous economic and geopolitical importance of East Asia, Russia needs
access and influence in the region to secure and advance its own
economic and geostrategic interests.]{.underline} As such, [sales
to]{.underline} major Asian [players like India and China are a key
component of its ability to conduct a sovereign independent foreign
policy both in Asia and globally]{.underline} (Blank and Kim \[11\]).
This is also the reason why it continues to seek military-technical
cooperation with other countries in the Western Pacific.

[Russia also uses its military exports to increase its influence in the
Middle East. It sees its military technical cooperation with Arab states
as a means of anchoring its presence in Middle Eastern politics, and
maintaining influence in a region that is central the entire global
economy and energy market.]{.underline} The best example of this is the
Russian export of arms to Bashar al-Assad\'s government in the Syrian
civil war. According to Jonathan Saul, \"Russia is determined to
maintain its strategic foothold in the Middle East, has provided arms
and political protection to the embattled Syrian government of President
Bashar Assad\" (Saul \[42\]). A Middle East security source stated,
\"Dozens of Antonov 124s (Russian transport planes) have been bringing
in armored vehicles, surveillance equipment, radars, electronic warfare
systems, spare parts for helicopters, and various weapons including
guided bombs for planes,\" (Saul \[42\]). [For Russia, the Syrian civil
war is not just some market of opportunity with which to make money, but
an immensely important strategic foothold that must be defended, and
whose continuing supply of essential weapons ensures extensive future
influence within Syria]{.underline} should Bashar al-Assad prevail.

In addition to the Syrian example, the loss of Iraq as a major importer
of Russian military hardware was perceived by Russia as a significant
blow to its influence in the region. A combination of the US invasion of
Iraq, and the perception within the Iraqi Army that Russia sold it
inferior weapons, led Iraq\'s government to shift to importing Western
technologies and equipment. However, Rosoboronexport communicated that
it would not hesitate to exploit any gaps in the US supply of weaponry
to Iraqi forces in the wake of Al-Qaida\'s seizure of Ramadi and
Fallujah (Isaykin \[41\]). Russia wants its influence in this central
Middle Eastern country restored.

This was operationalized when Russia exploited the American reduction of
arms exports to Egypt in 2013. Soon after the US withheld F-16s, M1
Abrams tank parts, and other military aid to the El-Sisi regime in
Egypt, Russia quickly moved in and began making arms deals with the
government. According to Jane\'s Defense Weekly, an initial agreement in
November 2013 was reached between Russia and Egypt covering the delivery
of arms and equipment worth \$3 billion (dependent upon Saudi Arabia
assisting Egypt with a loan), and includes MiG-29M/M2 fighters, air
defense systems, Mi-35 helicopters, coastal anti-ship missiles, light
weapons, and ammunition (Binnie \[ 3\]). One could argue that Russia is
primarily trying to find additional markets to sell its arms and that it
is simply taking advantage of the US withdrawal of military support to
generate increased revenue. However, the talks were conducted directly
between Egypt\'s Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmi, Russian Foreign Minister
Lavrov, and Defense Minister Shoigu (Binnie \[ 3\]), indicating this
arms contract is deeply tied to Russia\'s foreign policy and
geostrategic maneuvering in the Middle East.

Fourth, [Russia frequently uses its military exports to obtain
extraction rights in resource-rich areas.]{.underline}
Rosoboronexport\'s chief, Isaykin stated,

It is true that [negotiations on the development of some mineral
resources are conducted more often than not with Russian
investors.]{.underline} These may be any firms, any enterprises that are
interested in extracting oil, for instance. We simply need to understand
we are not alone in this big wide world. The various countries\' natural
resources are of interest to a great many states, China in particular.
The very fiercest competition is underway for the right to develop
mineral resources in African countries. (Isaykin \[41\])

The fact that the head of Russia\'s military export organization is
making this comment publicly speaks volumes. The primary point, of
course, is that he sees his organization as an integral part of
Russia\'s efforts to gain access to mineral-rich areas conforms the
linkage between these two aspects of Russian policy.

There are numerous examples of how Russia sells weapons in pursuit of
natural resources in the Middle East and Asia. In fact, it is one of the
reasons why Russia is supporting Assad in Syria. According to a Russian
defense industry official, \"Stuff is definitely coming into Syria, and
[Russia realizes they have to keep Assad in power if they want to keep a
hold of what they have there, especially with oil and gas reserves up
for grabs]{.underline}\" (Saul \[42\]). In reciprocation for the weapons
and military equipment Russia provided Syria, the Russian oil and gas
company, Soyuzneftegaz, signed a \$90 million deal with Syria\'s oil
ministry in December 2013 for oil exploration and production in a 2190
square kilometers (845 square miles) bloc of Mediterranean waters off
the Syrian coast between Tartus and Banias. Syrian oil officials say
they are confident their waters hold significant oil or gas reserves,
pointing to substantial discoveries in the eastern Mediterranean off
Israel and Cyprus and promising surveys carried out in the waters of
Lebanon (Saul \[42\]).

[Russia also uses its arms trade with Vietnam]{.underline} in a similar
way. It is a well known in South-East Asia that [Russia desires a modest
amount of access to the underwater natural resources of the South China
Sea.]{.underline} As such, it was no surprise to experts in the region
when joint Russo-Vietnamese resource extraction and energy development
agreements were established. Russia achieved this access partly through
the assistance it gave to Vietnam in building a nuclear power plant.
However, Russia also sold Vietnam a third tranche of the sale of 20 new
SU-30MK2 fighter aircraft (which can target ships, aerial and ground
targets), as well as six Project 636 Varshavyanka-class submarines,
which are upgraded Kilo-class submarines that can more effectively
conduct anti-submarine, anti-ship, general reconnaissance, and patrols
in relatively shallow waters like the South China Sea (Blank \[ 6\]).
Such arms sales, of course, help Vietnam solidify its claims over the
areas where Russia wants to extract resources, territories that also
happen to be claimed by China. [This]{.underline}, of course, [is an
excellent example of Russia using its military exports to directly
defend an economic interest especially an energy interest.]{.underline}

Another country in South-East Asia, where Russia is pursuing natural
resource extraction rights is Bangladesh. In a meeting with the
Bangladesh Prime Minister Sekh Hasina on 15 January 2013, President
Putin pledged to lend Bangladesh \$1 billion to buy weapons, \$500
million to construct the country\'s first nuclear plant, as well as
discussed the possibilities of expanding trade to the level of \$1
billion, which will include helping Bangladesh launch national
telecommunications satellites. Bangladesh utilized those funds to
purchase a number of Russian Mi-17 transport helicopters, armored
vehicles, and infantry weapons. In return, Gazprom was given the rights
to drill ten natural gas wells in Bangladesh territory (Blank \[ 7\]).
Russia hopes to generate 56 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas
annually from the Gazprom drill sites (Blank \[ 7\]). This would
strengthen Russia\'s position as an energy provider in a region where
energy development and extraction rights have become exponentially more
important in recent years. Therefore, again Russia is seeking to enter
into the lucrative South Asia/South-East Asia energy production market
partly through concerted, focused arms sales to help \"modernize\" their
partner\'s military.

One last example of Russia utilizing its arms to seek extraction rights
is in Algeria. Since 2011, Russia has sold Algeria 305 T-90S main battle
tanks, 150 BTR-80 APCs, 180 self-propelled artillery pieces, 100 MLRS
systems, 4 batteries of S-300 PMU-2 air defense missiles, 38 S1 Pantsir
air defense systems, and 30 ZSU-23--4 air defense artillery systems in
the last decade (Agence France-Presse \[ 1\]). Additionally, in the same
time period, Algeria has also purchased 28 Su-30s fighters. Most of
these sales have been conducted by Russia in order to gain greater
influence over Algeria\'s gas industry and its production and sale of
liquefied natural gas, which would give it more leverage upon Europe
(i.e. keeping Europe highly dependent on Russian energy exports) (Blank
and Kim \[11\]). Thus, it has been a setback for Russia when in
2007--2008 it had to take back 15 Mig-29 fighters that were part of a
larger \$8 billion deal from Algeria, who refused them on the grounds of
poor quality (they had been made from old parts) (Blank and Kim \[11\]).
This frustrated Russian initiatives at the time to enmesh Algeria in a
web of energy and arms deals. The point here is that there are numerous
examples of how Russia uses the export of arms as one of its primary
tools to obtain its economic interests in other domains.

Fifth, [Russia uses military exports as the basis for defense relations
with other countries]{.underline}. Military export agreements usually
include numerous after-sale services agreements between countries, which
include maintenance services and technical expertise, delivery of spare
parts, training and doctrinal expertise on the weaponry systems and
equipment, as well as future upgrade agreements or opportunities. As
such, [military technical cooperation is a physical element of a defense
relationship between Russia and another state.]{.underline} This concept
is held at the highest level of the Russian government, as President
Putin stated at an FSTVS meeting,

Quality service, after-sales maintenance and service, and training for
specialists are all important means for promoting our goods on foreign
markets. Today we will look at the situation with implementing the
Commission\'s decisions to set up modern training and resource base for
training foreign military specialists.

It also usually complements high-level military to military talks, and
military education officer exchange programs (officers from the
importing state going to Russian military academies for their
education).

Additionally, military technical cooperation often leads to the conduct
of military exercises. The utilization of the same weaponry, and the
doctrines that weaponry was designed for, serves as the premise for
conducting military exercises between Russia and the importing country
in order to test and improve tactical and operational capabilities, as
well as identify gaps and weaknesses (Pollack \[27\], pp. 132--135). As
such, military exports are a foundation of Russia\'s defense
relationships, since they are integral to Russia\'s ability to build and
strengthen them.

The best examples of Russia employing its military exports to advance
its defense relations are its sales to India and Vietnam. India has long
been one of the great examples of the connection between Russia\'s arms
trade and defense relationships. For a number of decades, Russia
provided almost all of the India\'s imported weapons, and is still the
largest provider of military arms to India. India and Russia have
several major joint military programs including: BrahMos cruise missile
program, the FGFA fifth-generation fighter jet program, Sukhoi Su-30MKI
program, and Ilyushin/HAL Tactical Transport Aircraft. Joint development
projects are usually an indicator of trust between the defense
establishments of two states, since technologies are being shared and
systems are being customized for one of the country\'s needs. Since this
joint development between Russia and India is occurring in the currently
strategically critical areas of anti-ship cruise missiles, combat
aircraft, and transport aircraft, the strength of the relationship is
indicated (India has complained that Russia is withholding technology
concerning the FGFA fighter (Shukla \[43\]), thus illustrating the
strained relations). Additionally, India has purchased/leased an
enormous amount military hardware from Russia in the last decade: 1657
T-90s tanks under contract or already sold or built, Akula-II nuclear
submarines (two to be leased with an option to buy when the lease
expires), Tu-22M3 bombers (four ordered), a US\$900 million upgrade of
MiG-29, 80 Mil Mi-17transport helicopters, and 6 Ilyushin Il-76 Candid
transport aircraft (ordered to fit Israeli Phalcon radar) (Hughes
\[18\]).

These exports helped Russia strengthen its defense relations with India.
For instance, Russia is currently one of only two countries in the world
(the other being Japan) that has a mechanism for annual
ministerial-level defense reviews with India. Additionally, Russia has
conducted a number of military exercises with India, such as the INDRA
Exercises, one of which was conducted in inner Siberia. Russian arms
sales to India are inherently connected to these exercises. This is
indicated by the fact that shortly after India signed a \$1 billion deal
with Israel for 8356 Israeli Spike anti-tank missiles, 321 launchers, 15
training simulators, and peripheral equipment in March 2011 (Dagoni
\[13\]), Russia canceled the April 2011 INDRA naval exercises and the
June INDRA joint-army exercises (Aroor \[ 2\]). While there are other
factors involved, of course, it is indicative that the catalyst for
Russia\'s abrupt cancelation of the exercises (the Indian Navy
contingent was turned away after it sailed to Vladivostok) appears to be
a sign of protest of India\'s importing of arms from Israel.

However, in the last few years the relationship has become somewhat
strained for several reasons related to the arms trade between the two
countries. As mentioned above, in the past, Russia\'s policy was to sell
India more technologically advanced weaponry and equipment than it sold
China. Thus, Russia often balanced its military sales to India and China
in favor of India. Beyond the aforementioned points about China, this
balancing may have been recently reversed, due to the strained relations
between Russia and India. These strained relations were caused, in part,
because India is currently looking to Israel, the UK, Sweden, France,
and the US for military equipment now instead of exclusively Russia. In
fact, two events that are often cited as being major causes of the
friction in the relationship regard the arms trade. One of the greatest
points of frustration that India has in its arm relationship with Russia
is its purchase of the Russian Admiral Gorshkov aircraft carrier in
2004, originally for \$947 million (Defense Industry Daily \[19\]).
Tremendous delays and additional costs (five years before the ship was
delivered and a price increase to \$2.3 billion) (Hindustan Times
\[15\]) appeared after India signed the contract, and the ship\'s failed
2012 sea trial revealed that it was unable to reach full speed due to
malfunctioning boilers (Radyuhin \[32\]). As a result, [India\'s trust
in Russia\'s ability and integrity to carry out arms trade agreements
has suffered]{.underline} ever since. For Russia, few of India\'s
actions have caused it greater frustration and anger than its 2012
decision to purchase 126 French Dassault Rafale fighters instead of
Russian fighters (Swaine et al. \[45\]). The Russians viewed the
purchase very much as a betrayal, due to the fact that they believed
that they were going to obtain the contract (Swaine et al. \[45\]).
Additionally, Russia\'s frustration with India also regards India\'s
current attempts to develop its own defense sector in order to become
more self-sufficient (Hughes \[18\]). Nonetheless, despite all of these
issues, the Indian Military\'s inventories continue to be predominantly
composed of Russian systems. Therefore, India remains dependent on
Russia for weaponry systems, parts, and technical expertise, and
consequently, the relationship between India and Russia is still very
strong.

In addition to India, Russia is also Vietnam\'s largest weapons
supplier, accounting for more than 80 percent of its arms imports
between 1990 and 2010 (Hiep \[16\]). Russia\'s ties to Vietnam are
flourishing as Hanoi, clearly aiming to deter China, is now a major
customer for Russian weapons, primarily buying submarines and planes.
Recent Russian arms sales to Vietnam include 20 Su-30MK fighters (with
12 more to be delivered between 2014 and 2015) and six Varshavyanka
Class Submarines, as well as two Gepard-3 frigates (with two more to be
delivered between 2014 and 2016), and two K-300P Bastion-P coastal
defense missile systems (Hiep \[16\]). Vietnam purchased these weaponry
systems and platforms for the express purpose of defending its
territorial claims in the South China Sea, and to effectively deter and
defend against Chinese naval coercion and fait accomplish.

These arms sales have strengthened Russia--Vietnam defense relations.
Russia and Vietnam became \"strategic partners\" in 2001, a relationship
that was upgraded to a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2012
(Blank \[ 8\]). Additionally, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev
approved Russia--Vietnam military cooperation pact that would formalize
the two governments\' defense cooperation. These sales represent a
Vietnamese example of defense modernization to defend against threats to
its offshore energy interests, defend its claims in the South China Sea,
and deter growing Chinese aggressiveness (Blank \[ 8\]). In November,
2013, President Vladimir Putin visited Vietnam and concluded the
military cooperation pact to formalize bilateral defense cooperation
(Hiep \[16\]). This is clearly part of Moscow\'s own \"pivot\" to Asia,
which actually preceded its US namesake and aims to invigorate Moscow\'s
economic, military, and political position as a major, independent Asian
power in its own right (Blank and Kim \[11\]). Russia views its
relationship with Vietnam as a key to extending its foothold in
South-East Asia (Blank \[ 8\]). In these respects, Vietnam is
modernizing aging defense inventories like other East Asian countries
against defend against new threats.

Part of Russia\'s incentive for developing these defense relations is to
balance and counter the rise of China by strengthening other countries
and powers in the vicinity. [Russia wants to maintain strategic
flexibility.]{.underline} It does not want to be forced to maintain good
relations with China to the detriment of its own interests. Nor does it
want to be in a future situation, in which it would be forced to fight
China in isolation. It is also noteworthy that Russia is steadily
upgrading its military, economic, and political support for Vietnam,
despite the burgeoning identity of anti-American interests and
cooperation with China. Thus, it needs non-Western allies that are
similarly wary of China\'s rising power. Military exports are one of the
tools that Russia is utilizing to secure defense relations with India
and Vietnam, tie their militaries to Russia, and strengthen the
capabilities of India and Vietnam\'s armed forces.

Sixth, in addition to strengthening overall defense relations with
allies and partners, Russia also exports arms to, in order to, secure
basing rights. In support of its regional interests and world power
image, Russia is pursuing access to ports and the creation of military
bases, particularly air and naval bases, in key regions. Immediately
preceding the Ukraine-Crimea crisis on 26 February 2014, Russian Defense
Minister Sergei Shoigu announced progress in talks with eight
governments to establish a network of airbases around the world to
extend the reach of Russia\'s long-range maritime and strategic aviation
assets, and thus increase the country\'s global military presence (Jones
\[22\]). \"We are working actively with the Seychelles, Singapore,
Algeria, Cyprus, Nicaragua, Venezuela, and even in some other countries.
We are in talks and close to a result,\" Shoigu was quoted as saying.
\"We need refueling bases near the equator,\" Shoigu continued, \"It is
imperative that our navy has the opportunities for replenishment\"
(Jones \[22\]).

As Shoigu\'s remarks show, [Russia seeks a global power projection
capability]{.underline}. Specifically, [Russia would like to develop the
ability to effectively project its naval forces beyond its regional
waters]{.underline} (the North Pacific, the Baltic, the Black Sea, the
Caspian, and the Barents Sea). Russian naval ports in any of the areas
mentioned by Defense Minister Shoigu would significantly increase the
Russian Navy\'s regular areas of operation and presence. Furthermore, it
is also pursuing the aforementioned locations because **[they would give
Russia\'s strategic bomber force the ability, hypothetically, to strike
across a large percentage of the globe.]{.underline}** From the
Seychelles and/or Singapore, [a]{.underline} combined
[force]{.underline} of Su-34s and Tu-22Ms, **[armed with cruise
missiles, would be able to strike throughout the Indian Ocean, west
Pacific, and East Africa. From Algeria and Cyprus, Russian bombers could
cover the entirety of North Africa, the Mediterranean, and would
reinforce Russia\'s physical ability to strike throughout western and
central Europe.]{.underline}** From Venezuela or Nicaragua, Russian
strategic strike aircraft could strike throughout all of Latin America.
However, this only regards the technical ability of the Russian aircraft
to do this, and is separate from an analysis of the Russian ability to
effectively provide logistical support to these bases, and of the
personnel quality problems that the Russian Air Force is currently
having. Many readers may question how politically realistic any of this
is, but one must remember that [until recently the concept of Russia
seizing territory in Europe was also seen as impossible given
geopolitical realities, and then it took Crimea, and what was believed
to be possible in the modern international realm changed.]{.underline}
President Vladimir Putin has overt intentions to rebuild Russia as a
great military power with the capability to balance and counter US
military might. **[Russia will advance its geopolitical and geostrategic
power and influence wherever it finds that it can do so, regardless of
what other countries think is realistic or possible.]{.underline}** The
deliberate, focused sale of military hardware is one of the means that
Russia utilizes to do so.

Russia already utilizes military-technical cooperation with a number of
countries to secure basing rights in key areas. The most prominent
example in East Asia is Russia\'s efforts to secure access to a
Vietnamese naval base in Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam. In 2012, Russia
announced its interest in regaining port access to the naval base, a
step intended to enhance its power projection capacity, help guard
Russian energy extraction interests in the South China Sea, and to
increase its ability to balance against China (Blank \[ 8\]). The
efforts to acquire the base are directly connected to Russia\'s sale of
the six Varshavyanka-class submarines to Vietnam. This is evident
because Russia is helping Vietnam build a submarine base (for the
submarines Russia sold Vietnam), repair the dockyard in Cam Ranh Bay,
and provide maintenance support for other naval platforms. The submarine
base will increase the capability of Vietnam\'s Navy to protect
Vietnamese interests in the South China Sea by improving the ability of
the Vietnamese submarines to operate in the area. It is obvious that
Russia is very interested in developing the capabilities of the base not
only to strengthen the Vietnamese Navy (and therefore help balance the
rise of Chinese power), but also because Russia intends to gain access
to those facilities. Recently, both sides began discussing a document
allowing for regular Russian port visits to Vietnam for maintenance and
R&R (Blank \[ 8\]). While it remains uncertain whether Russia will ever
have a formal base in Cam Ranh Bay, access to the facilities allow
Russia an increased ability to operate in the southwest Pacific. Again,
this is clearly part of Moscow\'s own \"pivot\" to Asia, and aims to
invigorate Moscow\'s economic, military, and political position as a
major, independent Asian power in its own right.

One of the critical reasons for Russia\'s military-technical support of
Syria is maintaining access to their base at Tartus. The base is a
refueling station for Russian Navy ships, and provides the Russian Navy
with the ability to operate effectively and maintain a regular presence
in the eastern Mediterranean. Furthermore, it gives Russia a greater
ability to project its naval forces into the immensely important Gulf of
Aden if necessary. The necessity of maintaining this ability has been
one of the reasons, along with maintaining influence in Syria and the
region, that Russia and the Soviet Union sold weapons and military
equipment to Syria for decades. As such, Russia sells weapons to Syria
to enable it to have basing rights in the region, as well as to support
and enhance the influence of having a military base in the region
provides.

Conclusion

The concept that Russian military-technical cooperation with other
countries is primarily driven by the need to maintain a strong,
independent defense sector is insufficient if not false. It does not
accurately explain the reasons for how and why Russia conducts its arms
trade or the linkages to other issues like energy and the quest for
bases. Russia plans and executes its military export policy explicitly
as part of its foreign and defense policies, and does so in a variety of
ways. Russia views its reputation as the world\'s second-largest arms
exporter as integral to its status as a world power. It sees it not only
as a means of achieving and maintaining influence in regions of
interests, but as a cornerstone of its defense relations and basing
agreements in Asia and the Middle East. Additionally, Russia regularly
uses the export of its military articles to obtain resource extraction
rights from countries in regions of interest. Even Russia\'s arms trade
with China, often cited as the example of Russian sales of arms mostly
for profit, is now driven predominantly by Russian national security
interests. Thus, one must understand that [Russia\'s arms trade is not
some activity separate from its geopolitics, but one of the central
elements of its entire foreign policy and geostrategic maneuvers in Asia
and the Middle East.]{.underline}

It is imperative for US policy-makers to understand this. **[Russia is
not like many of the twenty-first century Western military
powers]{.underline}**. Whereas, the European countries, South Korea, and
Israel see the export of high-tech weapons and equipment as being as
much about revenue generation, economies of scale, and defense industry
self-sufficiency, Russian military-technical cooperation is geared
chiefly to its national security policy. One reason why this is
essential is because, as suggested above, Russia is encountering
difficulties in Asia and is globalizing its customer base to sell
weapons to Latin America, Africa, and other countries beyond Asia and
the Middle East or CIS members at a discount. **[That policy reflects
its global ambitions and willingness to destabilize other regions in
pursuit of its interests]{.underline}** (RIA Novosti \[40\]). [When
Russia sells arms]{.underline} in the Middle East, in South Asia, East
Asia, or anywhere else, it is not merely trying to enter into the
regional arms market or take bids and contracts from Western defense
companies. [Its intention is to support and advantage its own national
security, which often means taking influence from the US and its allies
in the region.]{.underline} For Russia, [**the geopolitical realm of
state interaction and influence is a zero-sum game. When Russia moves to
secure its interests, it often does so with the intention of it being
detrimental to the West** countries. Russia sees the Western countries
not as partners, but as competition, in every sense of the word. When
Russia sells arms, it is not merely looking for money, but it is looking
for influence]{.underline} and \"allies.\"

#### Russian military modernization allows for broader power projection

[Russia's annexation of Crimea in March 2014 has reinforced Western
concerns about Russian foreign and security policy.]{.underline} Under
President Vladimir Putin's rule, **[Russia is once more pursuing
ambitions to regain great-power status and extending a strategic
challenge to the West]{.underline}** (cf. CSS Analysis No.136). [Moscow
is trying to push back against US influence in Europe and to enforce a
sphere of influence in its own neighborhood.]{.underline} After the war
in Georgia, the Crimean crisis has once more demonstrated that military
challenges have returned to the European theater. [The following
provisional review of Russia's exceptionally ambitious reform to
modernize its armed forces, launched in 2008, is timely and highly apt
against this backdrop. Efforts at reforming the armed forces have a long
tradition in Russia, but they have often faltered due to lack of
political prioritization and insufficient determination.]{.underline} In
the 1990s, the armed forces were successfully returned to Russia from
their European bases with considerable Western assistance. Force levels
were reduced from over 4.5 million to less than one million troops. The
organizational structure was simplified. However, genuine reforms --
such as a full restructuring and reorganization to meet new threats --
failed due to resistance from traditionalists in the military, lack of
political determination, and insufficient funding. Meanwhile, the
political debate in Russia was marked by the experience of Western
military operations such as "Desert Storm" in Iraq in 1991, the Kosovo
war in 1999, or the attack on Iraq in 2003, as well as by Russia's own
experiences in Chechnya. Russian military theorists noted a
technological trend towards highly technical, remote-controlled
"sixth-generation warfare". There could be no doubt that [without
modernizing and restructuring its armed forces, which were largely a
legacy of the Soviet era, Russia could no longer compete on equal terms
in military conflicts with the US and NATO]{.underline}; nor would it be
able to operate successfully in asymmetric conflicts. The 2008 war in
Georgia was the decisive political impetus for renewed reform efforts.
It revealed significant problems in command structures as well as in the
sol-diers' equipment and training. Initial problems with implementation
were resolved through a massive increase of the defense budget, which in
2012 was expanded by 16 per cent compared to the previous year. Special
programs worth USD730 billion were introduced for improving equipment
from 2011 to 2020. At the same time, the military threat perception
broadened. Two aspects in particular were crucial in this context: First
of all, the US, and thus NATO, have moved progressively closer to
Russia's borders, and have been identified as the main threat in the
Russian foreign policy whitebook of 2008 and in the current military
doctrine of 2010. Previously, the Western military alliance had no
longer been listed as a primary threat in post-Soviet Russia. Secondly,
the threshold between military and non-military threats has been
eliminated. Thus, challenges that could have been dealt with as
non-military issues attained military relevance for Russia. In response
to the "color revolutions" of 2003 and 2004 in Georgia and Ukraine, the
"destabilization" of neighboring countries was ranked as the
second-highest danger. Domestic challenges, on the other hand, were
accordingly downgraded. Conversely, the doctrine now indicates a
willingness to use military force for the protection of Russian citizens
abroad. The operations in Georgia and Crimea confirm that Russia is
indeed willing to do so, irrespective of international law. Furthermore,
in the case of Ukraine, it is apparent that the notions of "citizenship"
and "threat" are extremely malleable. Structural Changes The military
reform announced by then defense minister Anatoliy Serdyukov in October
2007 mainly concerns three areas: Organizational structure, personnel,
and weapons upgrades. The basis of the new organizational structure was
a restructuring of the armed forces into a mainly professional volunteer
army in a permanent state of readiness. Also, due to these changes, the
share of conscripts will be reduced from its current level of 50 per
cent to 20 per cent. At the end of the decade, according to these plans,
conscripts will no longer take part in combat operations. At the same
time -- unlike in European professional armed forces -- the personnel
strength of the military will be raised from the current de-facto level
of 700'000 to one million soldiers. The core of this reform is the
abolition of the division (up to 13'000 troops) as the primary
organizing formation, to be replaced completely by brigades (4'000
troops). The aim is to increase mobility and to facilitate smaller-scale
operations of autonomous units. Due to the variety of challenges in
various parts of the country, there has been considerable resistance to
this uniform approach, which is why trials of the various structures are
still ongoing. One innovation in the organization of warfare has been
the introduction of four military districts, with each of which having a
joint operational staff. These staffs, patterned on the US model of
regional commands, will be tasked with directing operations, since the
Georgian war revealed great difficulties in coordination. The Western,
Southern, Central, and Eastern Military Districts largely correspond to
the four strategic directions. However, the Central District is mainly
conceived as providing support for the Western and Eastern Districts,
while the Western District will also carry out missions in the Arctic.
With 250'000 troops, the army is the largest service and is largely
concentrated in the Eastern District, which hosts four armies, compared
to two each in the other districts. Altogether, the army has 38 combat
brigades and 41 combat support brigades. Another 26 to 40 brigades are
to be formed by 2020, including 14 new army aviation brigades, which
will contribute about 90 combat and transport helicopters each to
reinforce the infantry's hitherto weak tactical air support and air
mobility. About 16 per cent of the combat helicopters are of recent
production. Additionally, new reconnaissance and air defense brigades
are to be formed. While most of the armored vehicles are functional,
they are mainly of Soviet vintage and are only gradually being
modernized. With its 150'000 troops, the air force is administratively
subdivided into two functionally distinct staffs -- the strategic
LongRange Aviation Command and the Military Transport Aviation Command
-- and, at the tactical level, into four territorial air force and air
defense staffs. Stationed in six main bases, the Long-Range Aviation
Command constitutes the airborne component of the nuclear triad. It has
around 140 Soviet-era long- and medium range bombers at its disposal.
Development of a new stealth bomber with variable-sweep wings is
underway. Although the Military Transport Aviation Command leads a niche
existence, it is to be equipped with 260 heavy transport aircraft by
2020, thus increasing the strategic flexibility of the army. The
tactical air force has 580 fighter jets, 12 per cent of which are of
recent design. Every year, four to five per cent of the fleet are
replaced. A fifth-generation, stealth-capable fighter jet is currently
undergoing trials and is supposed to be commissioned by the end of the
decade. How ever, Russia has no significant unmanned aerial vehicle
assets. Of the various military services, Russia's navy faces the
greatest problems. Its 130'000 seamen are distributed among four fleets
(the Northern Fleet, the Pacific Fleet, the Black Sea Fleet, and the
Baltic Fleet) and a flotilla (Caspian Sea). Apart from the
nuclear-powered ballistic-missile and attack submarines, there has been
little investment in naval assets. After decades of development, two new
strategic submarines have been commissioned, with a third still
undergoing trials. However, due to problems with the Bulava
intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), they have not yet been
equipped with nuclear arms. Russia has only one aircraft carrier, which
has been beset with failures. It also has one heavy nuclear-powered
missile cruiser; its sister ships are to be modernized and
recommissioned over the course of this decade, which would considerably
enhance the navy's capabilities. Otherwise, modernization efforts are
focused on frigates and Mistral-class helicopter carriers ordered from
France. These efforts will increase the ability to project power.
Besides the army, the air force, and the navy, there are four other
independent branches of the armed forces. The first of these are the
Strategic Rocket Forces, which control the land-based nuclear ICBMs. The
second are the elite Airborne Troops, which serve as a rapid deployment
force. The approximately 45'000-strong force is structured into four air
assault divisions and four air assault brigades as well as an airborne
reconnaissance regiment. Third, up to ten brigades of special forces
units were raised in 2013. These three service branches are directly
subordinated to the president rather than the operational staffs. This
increases their aptitude for flexible deployments, as can currently be
seen on the Crimean Peninsula, where, according to reports, regiments of
the 76th Guards Air Assault Division and the 31st Guards Air Assault
Brigade have been deployed. Fourth, the Aerospace Defense Forces operate
early-warning radar systems and satellite systems for identification of
hostile missile launches. They are expected to be significantly expanded
in the future. Furthermore, a Cyber-Warfare Command is expected to be
created in 2014. Problems with Professionalization [Among the core
elements of the reform as it relates to personnel are
professionalization, more autonomous leadership, and a tighter
organizational culture. The Russian military has traditionally had a
surfeit of officers.]{.underline} Under Serdyukov, the 335'000-strong
officer corps was initially downsized, but then expanded once more after
resistance and difficulties. He also eliminated the rank of praporshchik
(warrant officer), but it was brought back in 2012 by the new Defense
Minister Sergey Shoigu due to organizational problems. These
developments reflect difficulties in the transition from a mainly
conscript army to the new armed forces, which rely mainly on volunteer
soldiers. By 2020, it is envisaged that professional soldiers and NCOs
will constitute the backbone (50 per cent) of the armed forces. Although
the integration of contract soldiers is making rapid progress -- the
plan was, at least nominally, nearly fulfilled in 2013 with 60'000 new
entrants and a total of 205'000 to 220'000 professionals -- many
problems remain: In 2013, 35'000 contract soldiers left the armed forces
again. This indicates that many signed up for a three-year career mainly
because of the better pay. Many commanders also deplore the bad health,
lack of motivation, and rampant alcoholism among contract soldiers.
Currently, many brigades are only at 60 to 80 per cent of their nominal
strength. Culturally, too, the military is not prepared for its role as
employer. Contract soldiers have more rights than conscripts -- officers
cannot subject them to the usual harsh treatment. While contract
soldiers are expected to take on increasingly demanding leadership
tasks, their pay and living conditions are considerably worse than those
of career officers. The concept of engaging soldiers on short-service
contracts has thus not been a success so far, placing a question mark on
the professionalization of the military. The demographics also indicate
a negative trend. By 2024, the working population will decline by at
least 10 million. The numbers of 18- to 27-year-olds in particular will
decline by 2023. While the birth rate in Russia is currently increasing,
that is mainly due to the Muslim non-Slavic regions. It is important to
note another problem in this context -- the dominance of ethnic Slavs in
the military. Many Muslim applicants have already been turned back.
Moreover, the military continues to compete with many other state
security organs, such as the Interior Ministry, which also has
paramilitary units, or the intelligence services. Two per cent of the
population work directly for a state security organ. Russia thus has a
security apparatus proportionally more than twice the size of that of
the US. Stepping Up Procurement [Thanks to state procurement programs,
the lion's share of military expenditures -- about 60 per cent in 2013
-- are spent not on personnel, but on procurement.]{.underline} By 2020,
it is envisaged, 70 per cent of the troops will be equipped with
"modern" weapons systems; currently, only 19 per cent are. "Modern" in
this context refers to weapons that are no more than ten years old. To
this end, the armaments program for 2010--2011 was increased to a volume
of USD630 billion. Another USD100 billion are earmarked for developing
the military-industrial complex. The Kremlin's massive armaments program
and its reform of the military-industrial complex also has significance
in terms of industrial and social policy. The military industry employs
two million workers; five per cent of the Russian population depend on
it for their livelihood. In this way, the Kremlin is "solving" an issue
in Soviet style: [Funding for the military is once more taking on a
central role in society. It is hoped that this will boost innovation and
global]{.underline} [competitiveness. Russia is already the
second-largest arms exporter after the US, which it aims to overtake.
While Russia does have strong development programs for tactical
missiles, submarines, and tactical aircraft (helicopters and fighter
jets) and is a leader in air defense systems, it has significant
shortcomings in other areas, including crucial deficits regarding
information technology, radar technology, and high-precision weapons
systems.]{.underline} In these areas, Russia depends on purchasing
components, espionage, and technology transfers from Western companies.
Under Defense Minister Shoigu, procurement was re-nationalized: Simple
purchases of weapons systems from the West were stopped. At the same
time, it was decided that no more Western machine tools would be used
for the arms industry due to concerns over cyberattacks on the
electronics. Instead, the technology transfer will be stepped up through
cooperation with Western arms companies, and collaboration with emerging
countries like India will be increased. This policy will push up costs
and will not lead to the military being equipped with the best armaments
products. For instances, there are significant delays in the delivery of
a modern communications and reconnaissance system. Thus, Russia will
continue to have deficits in waging "sixth-generation warfare". Another
problem is the monopolistic structure of the industry, which is further
aggravated by lack of transparency in procurement. [Critics assume that
at least 20 per cent of expenditures in procurement are used for other
than the intended purposes. Bringing prototypes to serial production is
frequently fraught with difficulties. Hightech components cannot be
produced at consistent quality levels]{.underline}. Recurrent failures
in complex weapons systems can be attributed to fluctuations in
production quality rather than to design flaws. Furthermore, there are
bottlenecks in production capacity, for example in aircraft production
and shipbuilding. The plans to enhance military transport aviation can
only be realized if capacity is expanded rapidly. Russia also depends on
cooperation with Ukraine: So far, many motors for helicopters and
aircraft as well as rockets have been produced in Ukraine. Russia lacks
the know-how for producing many of the parts required. The current
conflict is putting a strain on this cooperation and necessitates import
substitutes, which entail great cost and delays. The Effects of
Remilitarization [Under Vladimir Putin, the modernization of Russia's
armed forces has become a priority for the first time]{.underline} since
1991. For several years, considerable sums have been expended on this
reform. [However, challenges remain when it comes to technology and
organizational culture; and demographic problems are also still an
issue]{.underline}. Moreover, [the lagging economic output will
exacerbate conflicts of objective between social and defense
policy.]{.underline} Russia is very unlikely to achieve its aim of
building a millionstrong military that is capable of flexible deployment
by 2020. Within the framework of modernization, Russia is advancing the
establishment of small, flexible elite units for deployment on its
borders -- as in the current crisis in Ukraine. **[These capabilities
will allow it to exploit crisis in the region and to pursue
further-reaching strategic goals. As the reform progresses and equipment
is improved, the ability to win regional wars will also be
enhanced]{.underline}**. Only when it comes to the global projection of
conventional military power will Russia still be lacking sufficient
means. [Modernization will bring about considerable improvements of
Russian military capabilities. The country can use its newfound military
clout both for enforcing interests in its European neighborhood and to
position itself as an attractive partner for new alliances in Asia, as
indicated by closer cooperation and the augmentation of exercises
between Russia and China as well as India. Modernization is accompanied
by an expansion of the categories of challenges that may be legitimately
be resolved by military force. For politicians in the West, the question
is how to deal with this new assertive stance and Russia's improved
military capabilities.]{.underline}

Assessment," Secure World Foundation.

[There is strong evidence that **Russia has embarked on a set of
programs over the last decade to regain some of its Cold War-era
counterspace capability**.]{.underline} Since 2010, [Russia has been
testing technologies for close approach and rendezvous in both LEO and
GEO that could lead to a coorbital ASAT capability, and some of those
efforts have links to a Cold War-era LEO co-orbital ASAT
program.]{.underline} However, the technologies could also be used for
non-aggressive applications, and the on-orbit testing done to date does
not conclusively prove they are for an ASAT program. Russia is almost
certainly capable of some limited DA-ASAT operations, but likely not yet
on a sufficient scale or at sufficient altitude to pose a critical
threat to U.S. space assets. Core Russian direct-ascent ASAT
capabilities are not yet operational, and those currently in development
are not planned to have the capability to threaten targets beyond LEO.
[Russia appears highly motivated to continue development efforts even
where military utility is questionable]{.underline}, due at least in
part to bureaucratic pressures. [Russia places a high priority on
integrating electronic warfare (EW) into military operations and has
been investing heavily in modernizing this capability.]{.underline} Most
of the upgrades have focused on multifunction tactical systems whose
counterspace capability is limited to jamming of user terminals within
tactical ranges. Russia has a multitude of systems that can jam GPS
receivers within a local area, potentially interfering with the guidance
systems of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), guided missiles, and
precision guided munitions, but has no publicly known capability to
interfere with the GPS satellites themselves using radiofrequency
interference. The Russian Army fields several types of mobile EW
systems, some of which can jam specific satellite communications user
terminals within tactical ranges. Russia can likely jam communications
satellites uplinks over a wide area from fixed ground stations
facilities. Russia has operational experience in the use of counterspace
EW capabilities from recent military campaigns. [Russia has a strong
technological knowledge base in directed energy physics and is
developing a number of military applications for laser systems in a
variety of environments. Russia has revived, and continues to evolve, a
legacy program whose goal is develop an aircraft-borne laser system for
targeting the optical sensors of imagery reconnaissance satellites,
although there is no indication that an operational capability has been
yet achieved. Although not their intended purpose, Russian ground-based
satellite laser ranging (SLR) facilities could be used to dazzle the
sensors of optical imagery satellites.]{.underline} There is no
indication that Russia is developing, or intending to develop, high
power space-based laser weapons. [Russian military thinkers see modern
warfare as a struggle over information dominance and netcentric
operations that can often take place in domains without clear boundaries
and contiguous operating areas. To meet the challenge posed by the
space-aspect of modern warfare, Russia is pursuing lofty goals of
incorporating EW capabilities throughout its military to both protect
its own space-enabled capabilities and degrade or deny those
capabilities to its adversary. In space, **Russia is seeking to mitigate
the superiority of U.S. space assets** by fielding a number of ground,
air, and space-based offensive capabilities.]{.underline} Although
technical challenges remain, **[the Russian leadership has indicated
that Russia will continue to seek parity with the United States in
space]{.underline}**.

#### US space leadership is key to prevent a space war---that causes extinction

**Lamari 16** (Omar Lamrani, Senior Military Analyst, Stratfor,
5-17-2016, \"Avoiding a War in Space,\" Stratfor,
https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/avoiding-war-space//KDES).

[Space is becoming more congested, contested and
competitive.]{.underline} Since the Soviet Union put the first
satellite, Sputnik I, into space in 1957, no nation has deliberately
destroyed another\'s satellite in orbit. But there is a growing
possibility that battles may soon be waged in space.

[Although the militarization of space started long ago, a number of
technological developments and tests over the past decade show that the
race toward its weaponization is accelerating.]{.underline} Driven by
Washington\'s dominance of and strategic dependence on space, [U.S.
rivals are working to develop and deploy anti-satellite weapons (widely
known as ASATs). The technology, which began to be developed during the
Cold War, has become an area of intense competition for the world\'s
most capable militaries over the past decade.]{.underline}

[For the United States, being the leader in military space technologies
provides immense advantages]{.underline}. At the same time, its outsize
reliance on those technologies entails risks. The current unequal
dependence on space, the United States fears, could give adversaries
incentive to attack its infrastructure in orbit. Washington is therefore
pushing to bolster its capabilities and is preparing for the possibility
that a future conflict could escalate into space. As the militarized
space race continues, the United States will stay focused on
deterrence**[. A war in space would be devastating to
all]{.underline}**, and preventing it, rather than finding ways to fight
it, will likely remain the goal.

An Unequal Dependence

[Washington\'s dependence on space infrastructure reflects the United
States\' dominance in space. The tyranny of time and distance inherently
hinders the United States\' ability to deploy its military across the
globe. But the space domain effectively helps the country to overcome
the limitations, allowing for enhanced force projection]{.underline}. As
a result, the U.S. military relies heavily on its orbital assets for
navigation, intelligence collection, precision targeting, communication,
early warning and several other crucial activities.

The great advantages that space assets afford the United States have not
gone unnoticed by its potential rivals. Though China and Russia, for
instance, also rely on space, they are less dependent on their space
assets than the United States is. First, neither nation has as much in
orbit. In addition, because both put greater focus on their immediate
geographic regions, they can use more conventional tools to achieve
their objectives. For instance, Beijing, by virtue of geographic
proximity, could rely on its ground-based radars and sensors in a
conflict in the Taiwan Strait. The United States, on the other hand,
would have to lean on its satellites to support a response in the same
area.

Despite the United States\' superior ability to strike at enemy space
constellations --- groups of similar kinds of satellites --- competitors
may determine that the resulting loss of space access would be
worthwhile if they could severely degrade U.S. space access. And while
the United States is the most proficient nation in space-based warfare,
there are limits to its abilities. Satellites in orbit follow
predictable movements, have restricted maneuverability and are difficult
to defend from an attack.

[Humanity depends on space systems for communication, exploration,
navigation and a host of other functions integral to modern
life.]{.underline}

[There is little doubt that a full kinetic strike on U.S. satellites,
which would inflict physical damage, would invite a devastating
response]{.underline}. But [tactics designed to degrade the satellites\'
abilities, rather than to destroy their hardware, could be deemed less
escalatory and therefore perhaps worth the risk. These include jamming
signals, hacking operational software and dazzling]{.underline}
(temporarily blinding) [or permanently disabling sensors. Calculating
the risk of nonkinetic strikes, which would create little physical
damage and could even be reversed, a potential foe would take into
account the United States\' hesitance to escalate a conflict in space,
given its heavy dependence on orbital technology]{.underline}.

Reinforcing Deterrence

[If the United States wants to preserve its primacy in the face of
increasing threats to its strength in space, Washington will need to
invest in strategies to deter attacks on its orbital
assets]{.underline}. [The first step in strengthening space deterrence
is to ensure proper attribution: The United States cannot hold its
enemies accountable for attacks if it does not know who initiated
them.]{.underline} But the vastness of space, along with the difficulty
of obtaining physical evidence from attacked satellites, can make
responsibility hard to prove.

To that end, the United States is investing in a second-generation
surveillance system, known as Space Fence, to track satellites and
orbital debris. Slated to begin operating in 2018, Space Fence uses
ground-based radars that give it 10 times the detection capability of
its predecessor, the Air Force Space Surveillance System. In addition,
the United States has been working with a classified satellite defense
technology called the Self-Awareness Space Situational Awareness system,
which reportedly will be able to pinpoint the source of a laser fired at
a satellite.

Redundancy and shielding can also deter limited attacks against
satellites. The innate redundancy of large satellite constellations
could make attacking them too risky; such an assault would fail to
significantly impair U.S. space control while still inviting
retaliation. Meanwhile, more widespread use of resistant antenna
designs, filters, surge arresters and fiber-optic components, which are
less vulnerable to attack, is already being explored to further shield
satellites from jamming, dazzling and blinding.

Finally, the United States can work alongside its global partners and
allies to convey the idea that **[a full-blown battle that would destroy
orbiting satellites would be bad for all of humanity]{.underline}**.
Reinforcing this message and openly tying it to a powerful U.S. response
could further bolster deterrence.

Preventing a War in Space

[While the United States works to discourage hostilities in space, in no
small part to ensure its enduring advantage there, Washington is also
taking more steps to plan for the contingency of a war in
space.]{.underline} The Department of Defense has nominated the
secretary of the U.S. Air Force as the initiative\'s principal adviser,
tasked with coordinating space-related efforts across the military. Late
last year, the United States also established the Joint Interagency
Combined Space Operations Center at Colorado\'s Schriever Air Force
Base. The center facilitates information sharing across the national
security space enterprise and has already run a number of war game
scenarios to simulate conflict in orbit.

A war in space would be devastating to all, and preventing it, rather
than finding ways to fight it, will likely remain the goal.

Furthermore, the Pentagon has added \$5 billion to its space programs
budget in 2016, pushing the total to about \$27 billion. The budget
provides for spending on technologies and tactics that can help the
United States mitigate and recover from a space attack. One effort,
spearheaded by the Operationally Responsive Space Office, aims to
develop small satellites and associated launch systems that can be built
and deployed quickly and cheaply. (For the most part, the current U.S.
fleet consists of large, sophisticated and expensive satellites, some of
which cost billions of dollars and take years to construct.)

As part of this endeavor, the office has directed the development of a
standardized but modular satellite chassis that allows for multiple
payload variations. The result is increased flexibility, as well as
lower costs and quicker turnaround in production. Developing a less
expensive and more efficient way to launch replacements for destroyed or
disabled systems is the next step. With that in mind, the Operationally
Responsive Space Office is funding the development of the Spaceborne
Payload Assist Rocket-Kauai (SPARK) launch system, designed to send
miniaturized satellites into low-Earth and sun-synchronous orbits. In
its efforts to rapidly launch swarms of miniaturized satellites on the
cheap, the U.S. military is also looking to leverage the private sector.
Companies such as Virgin Galactic (with the LauncherOne) and the Rocket
Lab (with the Electron Vehicle) have expressed keen interest in the
initiative.

[The small satellite revolution promises the speedy replacement of
disabled satellites in the event of attack --- theoretically securing
the U.S. military\'s use of space constellations in support of
operations during a conflict.]{.underline} Small satellites are not a
magic bullet, however; key satellite functions will still depend on
bulkier and more complex systems, such as the large but critically
important nuclear-hardened command-and-control mission satellites. Many
of these systems involve hefty antennas and considerable power sources.

Given that access to orbit may not be guaranteed during a war in space,
the United States has also been exploring alternative ways to perform
some of the core functions that satellites now provide. At this stage,
high-flying unmanned aerial vehicles with satellite-like payloads offer
the most advanced alternative. But considering the vehicles\'
vulnerability to sophisticated air defenses, their lower altitude and
endurance relative to orbital satellites, and their limited global
reach, this remains a tentative solution at best.

Overall, [the United States is getting far more serious about the threat
of space warfare. Investment in new technologies is increasing, and the
organizational architecture to deal with such a contingency is being put
in place. In the race between shield and sword, however, there is no
guarantee that offensive ASAT capabilities will not have the advantage,
potentially denying critical access to space during a catastrophic
celestial war]{.underline}.

The High Cost of a War in Space

Increased competition in space is reviving fears of a war there, one
with devastating consequences. Humanity depends on space systems for
communication, exploration, navigation and a host of other functions
integral to modern life. Moreover, future breakthroughs may await in
space, including solar energy improvements, nuclear waste disposal and
extraterrestrial mining.

**[In severity, the consequences of space warfare could be comparable to
those of nuclear war.]{.underline}**

[A war in space would disable a number of key satellites, and the
resulting debris would place vital orbital regions at risk. The damage
to the world economy could also be disastrous. In severity, the
consequences of space warfare could be comparable to those of nuclear
war. What\'s more, disabling key constellations that give early launch
warnings could be seen as the opening salvo in a nuclear attack, driving
the threat of a wider conflagration.]{.underline}

**[Russia will target the European parliamentary elections in

--- [where it can hope to have the most influence on the composition of

pro-Russian or eurosceptical political forces]{.underline},\" writes the
report\'s author Mikk Marran, director general of the Estonian Foreign

[The report says Russian intelligence services will continue **the
extensive cyberespionage campaign against the West** that they have
pursued for years]{.underline}, with the military intelligence service,
called the GRU, and Russia\'s spy agency, the Federal Security Service
(FSB) directing most operations. [Cyber espionage groups]{.underline}
APT28 and Sandworm [are the most active of the Russian-backed groups,
usually exploiting simple online tools and tactics, like phishing
campaigns]{.underline} and \"most likely to blur the line between
clearly state-sponsored attacks and the activities of online activists
and profiteering cyber criminals,\" the report says. SNAKE APT, a group
tied to the FSB, operates more covertly, according to the report.
\"[Most cyber and information operations originating from Russia are led
by the special services]{.underline}, particularly the FSB and GRU,\"
who often enlist cybercriminals to do the work for them. According to
the report, [Russian intelligence and special services use human, cyber

information, including tapping into civilian communication services
inside and outside the country.]{.underline} \"All Russian
communications service providers are required to give the FSB access

force service providers operating in Russia to disclose their decryption

armed forces leaders believe a military conflict with NATO will be
sparked by a \"colored revolution\" in one of Russia\'s neighboring
countries**]{.underline}, in other words Western intelligence services
encouraging democratic uprisings. [If crisis breaks out, Russia is most
likely to attack the Baltic States first, but a conflict between Russia
and NATO would involve attacks on Western Europe]{.underline}, says the
report. Vladimir [Putin continues to focus attention on Belarus and
moving both the leadership and population closer to Russia and away from
any western influences, according to the report]{.underline}. \"If

### 2NC Fill In DA-Russia-terminal impact -- china rise bad

#### A Chinas rise of to an economic hegemon, while weak, would threaten American security and DIB, mounting to a great powers war that could spill over to a nuclear conflict world wide 

**Choi 18** Ji Young Choi, January-March 2018 associate professor in the
Department of Politics and Government and affiliated professor in the
International Studies Program and East Asian Studies Program at Ohio
Wesleyan University ("Historical and Theoretical Perspectives on the
Rise of China: Long Cycles, Power Transitions, and China\'s Ascent,"
Asian Perspective, Vol. 42, Issue 1, January-March 2018, pages 61-84,
Available through ProQuest) <https://muse.jhu.edu/article/713812>

I have explored in light of historical and theoretical perspectives
whether China is a candidate to become a global hegemonic power. The
next question I will address is whether the ascent of China will lead to
a hegemonic war or not. As mentioned previously, historical and
theoretical lessons reveal that a rising great power tends to challenge
a system leader when the former\'s economic and other major capabilities
come too close to those of the latter and the former is dissatisfied
with the latter\'s leadership and the international rules it created.
[This means that the rise of China could produce intense hegemonic
competition and even a global hegemonic war. The preventive motivation
by an old declining power can cause a major war with a newly emerging
power when it is combined with other variables (Levy 1987). While a
preventive war by a system leader is historically rare, a newly emerging
yet even relatively weak rising power at times challenges a much more
powerful system leader]{.underline}, as in the case of Japan\'s attack
on Pearl Harbor in 1941 (Schweller 1999). A historical lesson is that
\"incomplete catch-ups are inherently conflict-prone\" (Thompson 2006,
19[). This implies that even though it falls short of surpassing the
system leader, the rise of a new great power can produce significant
instability in the interstate system when it develops into a revisionist
power. Moreover, the United States and China are deeply involved in
major security issues in East Asia (including the North Korean nuclear
crisis, the Taiwan issue, and the South China Sea disputes), and we
cannot rule out the possibility that one of these regional conflicts
will develop into a much bigger global war in which the two superpowers
are entangled]{.underline}. According to Allison (2017), who studied
sixteen historical cases in which a rising power confronted an existing
power, a war between the United States and China is not unavoidable, but
escaping it will require enormous efforts by both sides. Some Chinese
scholars (Jia 2009; Wang and Zhu 2015), who emphasize the transformation
of China\'s domestic politics and the pragmatism of Beijing\'s
diplomacy, have a more or less optimistic view of the future of US-China
relations. Yet my reading of the situation is that since 2009 there has
been an increasing gap between this optimistic view and what has really
happened. It is premature to conclude that China is a revisionist state,
but in what follows I will suggest some important signs that show China
has revisionist aims at least in the Asia Pacific and could develop into
a revisionist power in the future. Beijing has concentrated on economic
modernization since the start of pro-market reforms in the late 1970s
and made efforts to keep a low profile in international security issues
for several decades. It followed Deng Xiaoping\'s doctrine: \"hide
one\'s capabilities, bide one\'s time, and seek the right opportunity.\"
Since 2003, China\'s motto has been \"Peaceful Rise\" or \"Peaceful
Development,\" and Chinese leadership has emphasized that the rise of
China would not threaten any other countries[. Recently, however,
Beijing has adopted increasingly assertive or even aggressive foreign
policies in international security affairs. In particular, China has
been adamant about territorial issues in the East and South China Seas
and is increasingly considered as a severe threat by other nations in
the Asia Pacific region. Since 2009, for example, Beijing has increased
naval activities on a large scale in the area of the Diaoyu/Senkaku
Islands in the East China Sea. In 2010, Beijing announced that just like
Tibet and Taiwan, the South China Sea is considered a core national
interest. We can identify drastic rhetorical changes as well. In 2010,
China\'s foreign minister publicly stated, \"China is a big country . .
. and other countries are small countries and that is just a
fact]{.underline}\" (Economist 2012). In October 2013, Chinese leader Xi
Jinping also used the words \"struggle and achieve results,\"
emphasizing the importance of China\'s territorial integrity (Waldron
2014, 166-167). Furthermore, China has constructed man-made islands in
the South China Sea to seek \"de facto control over the resource-rich
waters and islets\" claimed as well by its neighboring countries (Los
Angeles Times 2015[). As of now, China\'s strategy is to delay a direct
military conflict with the United States as long as possible and use its
economic and political prowess to pressure smaller neighbors to give up
their territorial claims (Doran 2012). These new developments and
rhetorical signals reflect significant changes in China\'s foreign
policies and signify that China\'s peaceful rise seems to be over. A
rising great power\'s consistent and determined policies to increase
military buildups can be read as one of the significant signs of the
rising power\'s dissatisfaction with the existing order and its
willingness to do battle if it is really necessary. In the words of
Rapkin and Thompson (2003, 318), \"arms buildups and arms races . . .
reflect substantial dissatisfaction on the part of the challenger and an
attempt to accelerate the pace of military catchup and the development
of a relative power advantage.\" Werner and Kugler (1996) also posit
that if an emerging challenger\'s military expenditures are increasing
faster than those of a system leader, parity can be very dangerous to
the international political order]{.underline}. China\'s GDP is
currently around 60 percent of that of the United States, so parity has
not been reached yet. [China\'s military budget, however, has grown
enormously for the past two decades (double-digit growth nearly every
year), which is creating concerns among neighboring nations and a system
leader, the United States. In addition to its air force, China\'s
strengthening navy or sea power has been one of the main goals in its
military modernization program]{.underline}. Beijing has invested large
financial resources in constructing new naval vessels, submarines, and
aircraft carriers (Economist 2012). Furthermore, in its new defense
white paper in 2015, Beijing made clear a vision to expand the global
role for its military, particularly its naval force, to protect its
overseas economic and strategic interests (Tiezzi 2015). Sea power has
special importance for an emerging great power. As Mahan (1987 1890)
explained cogently in one of his classic books on naval strategy, Great
Britain was able to emerge as a new hegemonic power because of the
superiority of its naval capacity and technology and its effective
control of main international sealanes. Naval power has a special
significance for China, a newly emerging power, as well as for both
economic and strategic reasons. First, its economy\'s rapid growth
requires external expansion to ensure raw materials and the foreign
markets to sell its products. Therefore, naval power becomes crucial in
protecting its overseas business interests and activities. Second,
securing major sea-lanes becomes increasingly important as they will be
crucial lifelines for the supply of energy, raw materials, and other
essential goods should China become involved in a hegemonic war or any
other major military conflict (Friedberg 2011). In light of this, it is
understandable why China is so stubborn over territorial issues in the
South China and East China Seas. In fact, history tells us that many
rising powers invested in sea power to expand their global influence,
and indeed all the global hegemons including Great Britain and the
United States were predominant naval powers. Another important aspect is
that Beijing is beginning to voice its dissatisfaction with the existing
international economic order and take actions that could potentially
change this order. The Chinese economy has overall benefited from the
post-World War II international liberal order, but the Bretton Woods
institutions like the IMF and the World Bank have been dominated by the
United States and its allies and China does not have much power or voice
in these institutions. Both institutions are based in Washington, DC,
and the United States has enjoyed the largest voting shares with its
veto power. [Along with other emerging economies, China has called for
significant reforms, especially in the governing system of the IMF, but
reform plans to give more power to China and other emerging economies
have been delayed by the opposition of the US Congress (Choi 2013). In
response to this, Beijing recently took the initiative to create new
international financial institutions including the AIIB. At this moment,
it is premature to say that these new institutions would be able to
replace the Bretton Woods institutions. Nonetheless, this new
development can be read as a starting point for significant changes in
global economic and financial governance that has been dominated by the
United States since the end of World War II]{.underline} (Subacchi
2015). China\'s historical legacies reinforce the view that China has a
willingness to become a global hegemon. From the Ming dynasty in the
late fourteenth century to the start of the first Opium War in 1839,
China enjoyed its undisputed hegemonic position in East Asia.
\"Sino-centrism\" that is related to this historical reality has long
governed the mentality of Chinese people. [According to this
hierarchical world view, China, as the most advanced civilization, is at
the center of East Asia and the world, and all China\'s neighbors are
vassal states (Kang 2010). This mentality was openly revealed by the
Chinese foreign minister\'s recent public statement that I quoted
previously: \"China is a big country . . . and other countries are small
countries and that is just a fact\"]{.underline} (Economist 2012). This
view is related to Chinese people\'s ancient superiority complex that
developed from the long history and rich cultural heritage of Chinese
civilization (Jacques 2012). In a sense, China has always been a
superpower regardless of its economic standing at least in most Chinese
people\'s mind-set. The strong national or civilizational pride of
Chinese people, however, was severely damaged by \"the Century of
Humiliation,\" a period between the first Opium War (1839) and the end
of the Chinese Civil War (1949). During this period, China was
encroached on by the West and invaded by Japan, experienced prolonged
civil conflicts, and finally became a semicolony of Great Britain while
its northern territory was occupied by Japan. China\'s economic
modernization is viewed as a national project to lay an economic
foundation to overcome this bitter experience of subjugation and shame
and recover its traditional position and old glory (Choi 2015). Viewed
from this perspective, economic modernization or the accumulation of
wealth is not an ultimate objective of China. Rather, its final goal is
to return to its traditional status by expanding its global political
and military as well as economic influence. [What it ultimately desires
is recognition (Anerkennung), respect (Respekt), and status (Stellung).
These are important concepts for constructivists who see ideational
motives as the main driving forces behind interstate conflicts (Lebow
2008). This reveals that constructivist elements can be combined with
long cycle and power transition theories in explaining the rise and fall
of great powers, although further systematic studies on it are needed.
Considering all this, China has always been a territorial power rather
than a trading state. China does not seem to be satisfied only with the
global expansion of international trade and the conquest of foreign
markets. It also wants to broaden its (particularly maritime)
territories and spheres of influence to recover its traditional
political status as the Middle Kingdom. As emphasized previously, the
type or nature and goals or ideologies of a rising power
matte]{.underline}r. Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan (territorial
powers) experienced rapid economic expansion and sought to expand their
territories and influence in the first half of the twentieth century.
For example, during this period Japan\'s goal was to create the Japanese
empire in East Asia under the motto of the East Asian Co-prosperity
Sphere. On the other hand, democratized Germany and Japan (trading
powers) that enjoyed a second economic expansion did not pursue the
expansion of their territories and spheres of influence in the
post-World War II era. Twentiethcentury history suggests that political
regimes predicated upon nondemocratic or nonliberal values and cultures
(for instance, Nazism in Germany and militarism in Japan before the
mid-twentieth century, and communism in the Soviet Union during the Cold
War) can pose significant challenges to democratic and liberal regimes.
The empirical studies of Lemke and Reed (1996) show that the democratic
peace thesis can be used as a subset of power transition theory.
According to their studies, states organized similarly to the dominant
powers politically and economically (liberal democracy) are generally
satisfied with the existing international rules and order and they tend
to be status quo states. Another historical lesson is that economic
interdependence alone cannot prevent a war for hegemony. Germany was one
of the main trade partners of Great Britain before World War I
(Friedberg 2011), and Japan was the number three importer of American
products before its attack on Pearl Harbor (Keylor 2011). A relatively
peaceful relationship or transition is possible when economic
interdependence is supported by a solid democratic alliance between a
rising great power and an existing or declining one. Some scholars such
as Ikenberry (2008) emphasize nuclear deterrence and the high costs of a
nuclear war. Power transition theorists agree that the high costs of a
nuclear war can constrain a war among great powers but do not view them
as \"a perfect deterrent\" to war (Kugler and Zagare 1990; Tammen et al.
2000). The idea of nuclear deterrence is based upon the assumption of
the rationality of actors (states): as long as the costs of a (nuclear)
war are higher than its benefits, an actor (state) will not initiate the
war. However, even some rationalists admit that certain actors (such as
exceedingly ambitious risk-taking states) do not behave rationally and
engage in unexpected military actions or pursue military overexpansion
beyond its capacity (Glaser 2010). The state\'s behaviors are driven by
its values, perceptions, and political ambitions as well as its rational
calculations of costs and benefits. Especially, national pride,
historical memories, and territorial disputes can make states behave
emotionally. [The possibility of a war between a democratic nation and a
nondemocratic regime increases because they do not share the same values
and beliefs and, therefore, the level of mistrust between them tends to
be very high. China and the United States have enhanced their
cooperation to address various global issues like global warming,
international terrorism, energy issues, and global economic stability.
But these issues are not strong enough to bring them together to
overcome their mistrust that stems from their different values, beliefs,
and perceptions (Friedberg 2011). What is more important is whether they
can set mutually agreeable international rules on traditional security
issues including territorial disputes.]{.underline}

## 2NC Fill In DA-Russia- AT: Russia can't catch up

#### Miscalc is possible even if they aren't caught up

**Trenin 18** Dmitri Trenin, JANUARY 2018, director of the Carnegie
Moscow Center, has been with the center since its inception. He also
chairs the research council and the Foreign and Security Policy Program
<https://carnegieendowment.org/files/Trenin_Hybrid_War_web.pdf>

The eventual outcome of the Hybrid War could be reminiscent of the
downfall of the Soviet Union, which was far less the result of the
U.S.-Soviet Cold War than of a misguided effort to reform the Soviet
Union itself. Russia might break down and break up again, or it might
decide on a foreign policy more geared toward its economic needs than to
a certain concept of world order. [As for the United States, it might
decide to limit its global commitments and redesign its international
role as the world's preeminent but no longer dominant state. Yet, in
doing so, it will need to accept that its change in status will come
with a certain price and that it will not be able to take advantage of
the benefits of the position it once enjoyed. Asymmetries in power lead
to asymmetric actions, which as Gerasimov suggested are intended to
"neutralize the enemy's superiority in warfare" or "identify and exploit
the enemy's vulnerabilities]{.underline}."7 By an order of
magnitude---or more---[Russia is outgunned, outmanned, and outspent by
the combined forces of the United States and its allies. To stay in the
fight, it must rely on its few comparative advantages and seek to use
them to maximum effect. These advantages include the geographical
proximity of some of the main theaters of operation]{.underline}, such
as Crimea and eastern Ukraine, [where Russia has escalation dominance;
the Russian political system, which allows for secretive, swift, and
decisive action; and Moscow's willingness to take much higher risks in
view of the disproportionally higher stakes involved for the Russian
leadership and a national culture that historically has tolerated higher
losses in defense or protection of the Motherland. Through swift
decisions and actions, made without prior warning, Russia is capable of
surprising its adversaries and keeping them off-balance. This situation
promises an uncertain, hard-to-predict, and risky environment, where
miscalculation can lead to incidents or collisions that, in turn, lead
to escalation]{.underline}. Granted, these incidents would be of a
different kind than the tank standoff at Berlin's Checkpoint Charlie in
late October 1961 or the Cuban Missile Crisis barely a year later.
Escalation resulting from miscalculation would not be automatic, but the
wider damage it could cause needs to be taken seriously

## 2NC Fill In DA-Russia- AT: Behavioral Change

#### Arms reductions cause fill in, not behavioral changes

**Rounds 4/16 --** Ray, Air Force Lt. Col. and Georgetown PhD candidate
in foreign relations. "The Case Against Arms Embargos, Even For Saudi
Arabia,"
<https://warontherocks.com/2019/04/the-case-against-arms-embargos-even-for-saudi-arabia/>

One area in which U.S. President Donald Trump does not need to worry
about making America great again is international arms sales. [The
United States accounts for 34 percent of all global arms sales(second
place Russia remains a distant 23 percent)]{.underline}, and has more
than 40 defense companies in the top 100 globally. However, with
civilian deaths caused by the Saudi-led war in Yemen estimated at
between 16,000 and 50,000 by the end of 2018, [calls for the United
States to suspend arms sales]{.underline} to its largest client ---
Saudi Arabia --- [have]{.underline} understandably [gained
traction]{.underline} in both Congress and the public. More generally,
several authors have penned articles in these virtual pages calling for
more selective U.S. arms export decisions or outright embargos, governed
less by economic motivations and more by concern about blowback, human
rights, dispersion, and reducing technology transfer. [I]{.underline}
respectfully [disagree with all of these recommendations. Whether it is
delayed approval]{.underline}, as [in]{.underline} the recent
[Kuwaiti]{.underline} F-18 purchase, [an outright embargo, like Egyptian
F-16s]{.underline} in 2013, [or denial of technology transfer, as
in]{.underline} the 2016 [Turkish Patriot missile request, using the
withholding of arms sales as a blunt force instrument of coercion is
unlikely to produce desired strategic benefits and often
backfires.]{.underline}

[Arms exports are best used for maintaining or strengthening
relationships while limiting adversary access to client states; a tool
of nuanced influence, not outright coercion]{.underline}. In fact,
[threatening to withhold arms sales to coerce a state into changing its
behavior often has the opposite effect, leading clients to diversify
their arms sourcing instead of shifting course]{.underline}. [Similarly,
calls to restrict technology transfer and worries about demands for
direct offsets mistake what is known as "design technology transfer" for
the much more difficult "capacity" level of transfer]{.underline}. Both
are explained in more detail below, but for now it is worth noting that
design transfer, the level at which most of these offsets occur, does
not lead to the creation of an independent defense industry, but instead
provides the [United States with a source of political
power](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/10242690903105398). [The
United States should not fear technology transfer, but with the
appropriate end-user controls, encourage it. Additionally, while a large
domestic market provides the United States the luxury of sacrificing
financial gains for political influence, sometimes economics do
matter;]{.underline} especially when it comes to preserving complex
production lines for future flexibility. Finally, the United States
should not look to use an arms embargo to coerce Saudi policy change,
not for economic reasons, but simply because it is unlikely to work.

Greasing the Skids, Not Twisting Arms

[Arms sales are [**useful tools for maintaining communication,
strengthening relationships**](https://doi.org/10.1162/ISEC_a_00250),
and keeping potential adversary states at bay]{.underline}. Conversely,
as a blunt instrument of coercion (i.e. if you do not do X, we will
suspend Y), they are likely losers. [Senior U.S. government officials
involved in the arms transfer process that I interviewed over the past
year during the course of my research have echoed similar
sentiments]{.underline}. This is also [[borne out by previous
research](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2645039) providing evidence that
using [arms transfers as situationally coercive tools is rarely
successful](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Keith_Krause/publication/271776300_Military_Statecraft_Power_and_Influence_in_Soviet_and_American_Arms_Transfer_Relationships/links/59e45e8faca2724cbfe8fb7e/Military-Statecraft-Power-and-Influence-in-Soviet-and-American-Arms-Transfer-Relationships.pdf).]{.underline}
Interestingly, [[coercion attempts using arms transfers are least likely
to be successful](https://doi.org/10.1177/0022002794038004004) when used
as a punishment or threat against an autocratic regime, such as Saudi
Arabia. Instead, punishments in the form of an embargo can often push a
client to diversify sourcing rather than to change
behavior.]{.underline}

Consider Indonesia and Egypt. [In 2015, Egypt agreed to purchase nearly
50 Russian MiG-29M/M2s and more than two-dozen French Rafales. This
represented a shocking turn of events after more than three decades of
purchasing only American-made fighter jets. It was also [driven
largely](https://egyptdefreview.wordpress.com/2017/07/02/egyptian-air-force-repeating-past-mistakes/) by
the [U.S.
embargo](https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20180607_RL33003_3e6eaeae1323407105ed93cb4d53cfa18247a7ff.html#ifn43) put
in place in 2013]{.underline}, after the Egyptian army's removal of
then-President Mohamed Morsi, who had won the presidency in a 2012
election. The embargo caused [significant tension between the two
states](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/04/lifts-arms-embargo-egypt-150401003510492.html) driven
by "an Egyptian sense that they were at a point of mortal peril" while
the United States was moralizing about democratic reforms. Remarkably,
the [United States lifted the
embargo](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/03/31/readout-president-s-call-president-al-sisi-egypt) in
2015 with virtually no change in Egyptian policies, [no official U.S.
"democracy
certification"](http://time.com/3766224/united-states-weapons-ban-lifted-egypt/),
and [Egyptian military support for the Saudi-led war in
Yemen](https://www.businessinsider.com/yemen-conflict-explained-2019-2#egypt-4).
The U.S. arms embargo as a tool of coercive change was an abject
failure.

[A similar story played out in Indonesia more than a decade prior.
A [long-time arms client of the United
States](https://worldpolicy.org/2009/11/13/report-u-s-arms-transfers-to-indonesia-1975-1997-world-policy-institute-research-project/#important) with
no [history of Russian

announced a deal with
Russia](https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/defense/2017-08-23/indonesia-barters-commodities-sukhoi-su-35-combat-jets) in
2003 to purchase Russian Su-27/30s. While Indonesia was always far more
politically neutral than Egypt, this remarkable turnaround in arms
sourcing diversification appears to be the result of a U.S. arms embargo
implemented in 1999 in response to [Indonesia's apparent human rights
violations](https://www.hrw.org/legacy/worldreport99/asia/indonesia.html) carrying
out heavy-handed military actions in East Timor.]{.underline} Furious at
U.S. meddling in something the government considered a domestic issue,
Indonesia looked instead to Russia with the specific intent
to ["overcome the effects of \[U.S.\] arms sales
restrictions."](http://en.people.cn/200306/24/eng20030624_118767.shtml) In
other words, Indonesia looked to diversify, not capitulate. Indonesia
continued sourcing Russian arms even after the United States lifted the
embargo in 2005. Perhaps most remarkably, even after the United States
agreed to give [Indonesia 24 F-16s in
2012](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-indonesia-arms-idUSL2E8JOGMO20120825),
the archipelago state still [agreed to purchase 11 Russian
Su-35s](https://thedefensepost.com/2018/02/15/russia-indonesia-su-35-contract-finalized/).
The U.S. attempt at coercion not only failed but continues to perpetuate
negative strategic effects today.

## 2NC China -- Links

#### China is filling in gaps left by the US -- they will sell to any buyer

**Zhen 18** (Liu Zhen, reporter on the China desk at the Post, "China
fills gap left by US in Middle East military drone market, British think
tank says," *South China Morning Post*, December 18, 2018,
https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/2178584/china-fills-gap-left-us-middle-east-military-drone-market)///JP

[[China plays a significant role in the supply of military drones to
Middle East countries]{.mark}, especially those that are barred from
importing them from the United States]{.underline}, a British think tank
has said.

The Royal United Services Institute said in a report that [[China has
**filled a void left by the US**,]{.mark} which has become more
selective about exporting armed drones and related technologies to the
region.]{.underline}

["China has often been described as a no-questions-asked exporter of
drones, has played and is likely to continue playing a key role as a
supplier of armed UAVs to the Middle East,"]{.underline} the report
said.

[The only two rules Beijing follows are dealing only with state actors
and prioritising usage for counterterrorism purposes,]{.underline} it
said.

China has sold advanced armed drones to several Middle Eastern
countries, including Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates, on the grounds they will be used to combat terrorism, the
report said.

[Beijing has stated on more than one occasion that it does not take
sides on conflicts in the region[. **All countries are therefore
potential clients.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[China is not a signatory to the Missile Technology Control
Regime]{.mark},]{.underline} an international treaty signed in 1987 that
seeks to control the sale of weapons such as missiles and armed unmanned
aerial vehicles. For example, it restricts the sale of missiles and
related technologies that are capable of carrying a 500kg (1,100lb)
payload for 300km (186 miles) or more.

China applied to join the treaty in 2004 but was rejected. It has since
pledged to voluntarily abide by its rules.

But [military experts have said that some armed drones fall into a grey
area under the agreement]{.underline}. For example, the CH-4B Rainbow, a
UAV manufactured by China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp, has a
range of just 150km if controlled from the ground but more than 1,000km
if fitted with a satellite guidance function.

It is not known if the company has ever sold Rainbow drones with the
enhanced capability to any of its clients.

[While US drones are generally regarded as technologically superior to
their Chinese counterparts, buyers in the Middle East often do not have
the option to buy the former and the latter are significantly
cheaper.]{.underline}

Iraq, for instance, bought at least four Rainbow drones from China in
2015 after failing to complete a deal on US-made MQ-1 Predator models.

According to reports by the Iraqi air force, as of the second half of
this year the drones had been used to carry out more than 260 strikes
against Islamic State.

Similarly, the UAE bought two different models of the Wing Loong drone
manufactured by China's Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group after it too
failed to finalise a deal on Predators.

[[The think tank's report said China has also offered to help countries,
including Saudi Arabia, to manufacture their own
drones.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[["Proliferation in armed UAVs in the Middle East is unlikely to stop
and could even accelerate, either through domestic production or
reliance on external suppliers, such as Beijing]{.mark},"]{.underline}
the report said.

#### There is a massive incentive to buy Chinese drones -- lower costs and the US won't sell

**Paulsson 18** (Henrik Paulsson, PhD in War Studies from the Swedish
Defence University, "Explaining the Proliferation of China's Drones,"
*The Diplomat*, November 10, 2018,
https://thediplomat.com/2018/11/explaining-the-proliferation-of-chinas-drones/)///JP

[[China's overt offshore military presence has grown in recent
years]{.mark}.]{.underline} These activities vary, ranging from
operating the first Chinese overseas military facility in Djibouti to
conducting patrols in the Indian Ocean. However, [China has long used
its extensive arms industry as a way to gain footholds -- even if just
through minor links. Their sales of drones are a clear example of
this.]{.underline}

[Most armed drones today are built by the United States, China, and
Israel. The United States mostly sells to NATO allies, increasing the
interoperability and common supply chains within the
alliance]{.underline}. U.S. sales to India are an attempt at supplanting
Russia's influence -- [part of the larger U.S. focus on Asia, including
countering China.]{.underline} Israeli provision of drones to India are
part of a larger defense cooperation between the two, while their
exports to Azerbaijan provides a presence just north of the largest
regional rival, Iran.

The Chinese Connection

[[Chinese armed drones have been operated or ordered by 17 countries.
While visually similar to the U.S. and Israeli drones, China's are
cheaper and less advanced -- all the while quite
operational]{.mark}.]{.underline} What is curious is to whom the Chinese
are selling to, and their relation to wider policies and strategic
choices[. [The buyers are widely dispersed; China has an interest in
building links with these countries because of geographic position,
economic conditions, or political situation.]{.mark}]{.underline} Most
already have Chinese investments, loans, and other weaponry.

[Many of the countries importing Chinese drones lie along the path of
China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).]{.underline} Pakistan and
Myanmar have long-standing ties with China, and both are now flying
Chinese armed drones, with Pakistan even producing a licensed version of
the Wing Loong II model. Further inland, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and
Uzbekistan have all received armed drones from China. All five of these
countries are critical for the BRI to function, and have seen increasing
Chinese investments and connections over recent years -- including
significant military investments in addition to the drones.

[[Chinese interests extend also into Africa.]{.underline}]{.mark} Egypt,
Algeria, and the Ethiopian involvement in Somalia all have roles to play
in the continued viability of maritime trade from China to Europe.
Zambia has large Chinese investments in their mining regions, while
Nigeria has oil and importantly lies on the Gulf of Guinea. These
[African and the above mentioned Asian states are positioned along vital
trade routes, giving China a distinct interest in building relationships
and providing tools to help secure trade.]{.underline} The combination
of both trade and investments provides ample excuse to provide drones in
addition to other weaponry -- all with increased ties to the Chinese
military and defense industry.

[I[n the Middle East China is more opportunistic in selling their armed
drones, supplying them to countries that cannot get drones]{.mark} [from
Israel or the United States]{.mark} for economic or political
reasons.]{.underline} While the Israeli constraint is obvious, [Iraq and
Jordan are both hindered by the high cost of U.S. drones -- instead
opting for Chinese versions for their fight against the Islamic
State]{.underline}. Politically, the Saudi- and Emirati-led campaign in
Yemen is more problematic, where they are accused of war crimes
utilizing Chinese drones. [[The lessening influence of the United States
in the Persian Gulf also provides inroads for China to replace
Washington]{.mark}, with their drones being a useful tool in this
endeavor.]{.underline}

[No matter the location, [all of the operators get pulled toward
China.]{.mark} The sale of drones causes an increasing dependence on
Chinese materiel -- such as spare parts and missiles -- to operate in
the first place. The drones also create a necessity to maintain defense
ties with China for training and operations.]{.underline} These are,
after all, quite advanced and complicated machines. [In their armed
drones, China has found a way to increase their influence and expand
their presence with any country that that the United States and Israel
will not -- or cannot -- sell to.]{.underline}

Lowering the Bar for Entry

Fully aware that the drones are pulling them toward China, why would
other states choose to receive them? Simply put, [most of the countries
discussed above either need or want the capability that operating drones
can bring.]{.underline} This stretches from the more basic, like
conducting long-range surveillance patrols, to the more infamous, in the
form of armed strike missions. [Many of these countries are also engaged
in murky conflicts and accused of abuses. China's willingness to supply
armed drones and countries' demand for them provides a win-win
situation: China gets a foothold, while the receiving end gets their
weaponry. Especially when the United States and Israel are unable to
supply their drones, why would a country in a conflict willingly abstain
from improving their capability?]{.underline}

[Most modern manned aircraft have significant costs involved in
procurement, maintenance, and use.]{.underline} Training a pilot can
cost millions of dollars --- [an investment that does not necessarily
disappear with unmanned aircraft]{.underline}. It does, however, lower
the risk of losing the aviator. [For countries with poor maintenance
standards and a history of unfortunate mishaps, this is a salient
point.]{.underline} Combined with the advanced age of their existing
airforces, the cost of operating traditional planes in the first place
can be insurmountable. [Chinese drones offer a similar, albeit lower,
capability to manned aircraft and at a cheaper price.]{.underline}

[[China's proliferation of armed drones benefits their strategic vision,
protecting their investments and interests, and provides a
foothold.]{.underline}]{.mark} Meanwhile [[countries are willing to
accept increased links with China in exchange for a new capability and
tool for combating threats]{.mark}. This willingness is only magnified
by economic and political isolation from other options. The capability
gap exists and will not disappear -- and China will be there to fill it
with their armed drones.]{.underline}

#### Chinese drones are the best option for US allies

**Pomerleau 1/15** (Mark Pomerleau, B.A. in Political Science, "Who is
China targeting with its armed drones sales?" *C4ISRNET*, January 15,
2019,
https://www.c4isrnet.com/unmanned/2019/01/15/who-is-china-targeting-with-its-armed-drones-sales/)///JP

[[China is cashing in on the demand for armed drones]{.mark}, according
to a new Department of Defense report.]{.underline}

China was the fifth largest arms supplier in the world between 2012 and
2016, the report, titled "Assessment on U.S. Defense Implications of
China's Expanding Global Access," said. The Chinese completed more than
\$20 million in sales with the country's second largest arms sales going
to the Middle East and North Africa "likely due to the demand for armed"
unmanned aerial vehicles.

The report, dated December 2018 but made available Jan. 14, is mandated
by law.

[The report notes that the drone and armed drone market is a niche
market but China is one of the world's few suppliers.]{.underline}

[[In large part to China's apparent willingness to export such
technology to other nations]{.mark}, the number of nations across the
globe with armed drones has grown significantly in recent
years.]{.underline}

The United States was the first nation to use this technology in combat
zones. However, [the United States has historically been limited in
sharing its technology with other nations and partners due to export
rules, much to the frustration of friendly nations]{.underline}, though
the Trump administration has sought to change that.

Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Paul Selva said
previously that [[U.S. export policies denying the sale of certain
systems, such as large unmanned systems, creates a self-limiting
factor.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[The United States has allies and partners who want to buy MQ-1
Predator and MQ-9 Reaper drones, so they go to the]{.mark} Russians,
[the Chinese,]{.mark} the Israelis, the French --- all whom are more
than willing to sell their technology to others,]{.underline} he said[.
[So the United States ends up with an ally that has systems that are not
interoperable with U.S. systems]{.mark}]{.underline}, noting "that's a
problem."

[As a result, China faces little competition to sell these systems given
most nations that produce armed drones are restricted from selling the
technology]{.underline} as signatories of the Missile Technology Control
Regime and/or the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for
Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies, the DoD report
notes.

DoD's report notes, however, that [Chinese arms are lower quality and
less reliable than those offered by top international arms
suppliers.]{.underline}

["Most of China's customers are developing countries that prefer less
expensive Chinese arms,"]{.underline} the report states. ["These arms
generally come with few end-use restrictions, which is attractive to
customers who may not have access to other arms sources for political or
economic reasons."]{.underline}

#### Trends show China will fill in

**Lu 3/12** (Zhenhua Lu covers US-China bilateral diplomacy and defense
for the Post. "China sells arms to more countries and is world's biggest

[[China is selling arms to more countries and is now the world's leading
exporter of armed drones]{.mark},]{.underline} according to a report
released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI)
on Monday.

But the latest data from the Swedish think tank shows Chinese arms
exports increased by a relatively low 2.7 per cent in the period from
2014 to 2018, compared to the previous five years.

Weapons exports from the United States, however, jumped 29 per cent in
the 2014-18 period from 2009-13.

Meanwhile, [China expanded its customer base to 53 countries in 2014-18,
up from 41 in the previous five years.]{.underline}

[The researchers also found that China is the world leader in sales of
armed drones, or unmanned combat aerial vehicles -- supplying 153 of
them to 13 countries in the past five years.]{.underline}

[By contrast, the US -- the world's biggest arms exporter -- only sold
five armed drones, to Britain, over the 10 years from 2009.]{.underline}

[The main buyers of the Chinese drones are Middle Eastern countries,
including Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates.]{.underline}

Nan Tian, a researcher with SIPRI's arms transfers and military
expenditure programme, said China's military technology advances -- with
more emphasis on developing its own weapons -- were a key reason for the
slower growth in arms exports, along with its defence budget.

"Previously[, [China]{.underline}]{.mark} [relied on foreign countries
such as Russia, Ukraine and France in developing its own armament
industry," Nan said. "Now, it [has increasingly turned to domestic
manufacturers such as AVIC and Norinco in arms
exports."]{.mark}]{.underline}

He added that armed [drones had been "one of the most visible
technological developments" made by Chinese arms producers.]{.underline}

Yemen.

This is despite the US waging a controversial drone campaign to take out
what it sees as suspected al-Qaeda targets in Yemen for more than a
decade. [[Saudi has]{.mark} since [turned to China]{.mark},]{.underline}
which unlike the US, is not signatory to the international Arms Trade
Treaty (ATT[) [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [so [has fewer restrictions on
the sale of drone technology]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline}

[[Chinese drones are cheaper]{.mark} to]{.underline}o. The [CH-4 costs
\$4m while a low-end Chinese drone can cost about \$1m.]{.underline} On
the other hand, American Reaper drones can cost in excess of \$17m.
Added to this a slump in world oil prices and [[it\'s easier to see why
the CH-4 has become the killer drone]{.underline}]{.mark} of choice for
countries [[across the Middle East]{.underline}]{.mark}. The CH-4 has a
range of about 3,500km and can carry the AR-1 precision-guided missile
that can hit a distant target with a margin of error of less than 1.5
metres.

At the launch last month of a report assessing the military and defence
capabilities of countries around the world, John Chipman, [director of
the International Institute of Strategic Studies, was cited]{.underline}
by AFP as saying that \"[[an emerging threat for deployed Western forces
is that with China looking to sell more abroad]{.underline}, [they may
confront more advanced military systems, in more places, and operated by
a broader range of adversaries]{.underline}.\"]{.mark}

[[U.S. forces are at increasing risk as China and other nations sell
more armed drones]{.mark} to anyone with the money to pay for them, [and
restrictive U.S. export policies may be making the situation
worse]{.mark},]{.underline} says a new report delivered to the Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs.

[[The RAND Corp. report
says](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR2300/RR2369/RAND_RR2369.pdf)
that drones produced by unfriendly nations will pose a "growing threat
to U.S. and allied military operations," in the near future, as China,
Russia, and Iran recognize the power of unmanned platforms, making it
certain that in future conflicts, "U.S. forces will have to cope with
adversaries equipped with different types and sizes of UAVs, both armed
and unarmed."]{.underline}

[In some ways, the future is now. In 2017, Iranian-made drones dropped
small munitions near U.S. forces in Syria, forcing American aircraft to
knock them out of the sky. Iranian drones have also buzzed American
warships in the Persian Gulf, and Iranian-made unmanned suicide boats
have targeted Saudi warships off the coast of Yemen.]{.underline}

[[American export restrictions on the sale of large long-range drones
have allowed China]{.mark} and Iran [to step in and fill the gap left
open by US policies]{.mark}.]{.underline} Beijing has really stepped up
its efforts to capture the market in ISR and strike drones, making plans
to build a drone production facility in Saudi Arabia, and actively
courting countries spurned by the American restrictions.

[Exports of American-made drones have primarily been restricted to the
handful of allies who have signed the [Missile Technology Control
Regime](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/mtcr), a consortium of 35
nations that sets limits based on range and payload.]{.underline}

At issue are Category I drones, which can carry a payload of 500
kilograms for more than 300 kilometers. Under the MTCR, these systems
are subject to a "strong presumption of denial" for transfer. But
changes being proposed by Washington seek to open new categories of
drones available for sale in part by focusing on speed instead of
range--- allowing drones that can fly less than 650 kilometers per hour
to be capable of being shipped to international partners. U.S. partners
such as Jordan, the UAE, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia --- all denied requests
to purchase drones from the United States --- have turned to China,
which is not an MTCR member.

Chinese CH-4 medium range drones are already stationed at the Saudi's
Jirzan Regional airport, not far from where UAE-operated Predator drones
operate from the same air base. Egypt has also purchased the system,
along with the Medium-Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) Wing Loong
drone.The UAE has also taken to selling drones to Russia and offering
them to other countries. Overall, China has sold advanced drones to at
least nine nations.

[[China has signed an agreement to establish a UAV manufacturing plant
in Saudi Arabia]{.mark} to produce up to 300 new drones --- [some of
them Category I.]{.mark} China and the UAE are not only marketing their
own drones, but also offering to build factories for
co-production.]{.underline}

**China filled arms vacuum in Saudi Arabia and is prepared to do it
again (same article read in the 1AC so we could use that as offense bc

[C[hina]{.underline}]{.mark} [has rapidly f[illed]{.mark} the
[vacuum]{.mark} left [by U.S. export rejections]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Page and Sonne, 2017). [China has exported near--category I UAVs (Wing
Loong II and CH-4) [to at least nine nations]{.mark}]{.underline}, as
listedinTable2.3. We argued earlier in this chapter that the Wing Loong
II might qualify as a category I system. In addition, in July 2017, [the
China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation
([CASC]{.mark})]{.underline} ["announced that it was [ready to
mass-produce and offered]{.mark} its CH-5 drone for
[export]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Khan, 2017). The capabilities of this UAV
place it above the category I threshold. Although no official sales have
been reported, [China is prepared to sell this category I UAV [in the
near future]{.mark}]{.underline}

Moreover, [[China]{.mark} has [also started]{.mark} to establish
[production lines with certain countries]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

UAVs it manufactures (Armstrong, 2017; Page and Sonne, 2017). This deal
alone will provide Saudi Arabia with up to 300 category I and
near--category I UAVs.]{.underline} Similarly, [[China has]{.mark}

## 2NC China -- WMD Drones

**Terrorists would use drones to deliver WMDs**

RAND Corporation. "Approaching a \'New Normal\': What the Drone Attack
in Venezuela Portends," *Rand Corporation*, August 13, 2018,
https://www.rand.org/blog/2018/08/approaching-a-new-normal-what-the-drone-attack-in-venezuela.html)///JP

[[The use of weaponized drones by lone individuals and small
groups---some acting as proxies of nation-states---is no longer just a
concern for the future, but very much for the
present]{.mark}.]{.underline} The proliferation of certain emerging
technologies has effectively diffused power and made it available at the
lowest levels. [The barriers to entry have never been lower for
individuals to gain access to commercial off-the-shelf technology that
can be used to lethally target individuals. Lone actors or small cells
of terrorists, criminals, or insurgents can effectively harness the
tactical flexibility of a small drone to wreak havoc, including
potentially using a drone to take down an airliner.]{.underline}

[State sponsorship of terrorist groups also increases the likelihood of
drone attacks, since states can provide the necessary equipment and
training,]{.underline} ensuring that terrorist attacks featuring
weaponized drones is a near fait accompli in the not-so-distant future.

It is already happening with Hezbollah and allegedly with the Houthi
rebels, who have used drones to ram Saudi air defenses in Yemen. Some
groups are mastering drone technology without the help of state
sponsors. In Syria, the Islamic State has successfully used drones to
conduct surveillance and reconnaissance in addition to carrying out
offensive actions like dropping a grenade on an adversary\'s military
base.

[[Since so many countries are now using armed drones in
combat]{.underline}]{.mark}---Nigeria, Pakistan, and Turkey have
recently done so---[[the chances for sophisticated drone technology
getting into the wrong hands increases
exponentially]{.mark}.]{.underline} If a terrorist group can steal or
purchase a drone from a rogue state or corrupt military or intelligence
officials, then they could rely on the myriad online videos posted that
essentially demonstrate how [these unmanned systems could be used to
conduct an attack.]{.underline}

That the drones were able to get so close to a world leader at a public
outdoor event in Caracas, Venezuela, speaks to how easy drones are to
use---and how difficult they are to defend against. Unmanned systems are
proliferating and commercial off-the-shelf technology is easy to
acquire. Hobby shop drones are small, lightweight, and relatively easy
to maneuver after a modicum of practice. [[Military-style drones are
heavier, but can also carry a greater payload with more
explosives]{.mark}.]{.underline} With the advent of machine learning and
artificial intelligence, [drones may soon become programmable and smart
enough to be used without human guidance and for increasingly nefarious
ends.]{.underline}

[One nightmare scenario universally feared by law enforcement and
security services is the use of a small drone to deliver chemical or
biological agents in an attack.]{.underline} It is already
well-established that [[al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups have long
sought to engineer a spectacular attack in the West using weapons of
mass destruction]{.mark}.]{.underline} The possibility that drones could
be used to disperse deadly agents or viruses over a sports stadium or
public gathering place is a harrowing prospect. Even if a drone attack
fails to result in large numbers of fatalities, the attempt could still
achieve an attacker\'s goal of perpetuating the psychological dimension
of terrorism.

## 2NC China -- Terrorists get drones

**Terrorists will threaten national security with warhead equipped drone
swarms**

**Bunker 15** (Robert J. Bunker, 2015 Futurist in Residence, Behavioral
Research and Instruction Unit, Federal Bureau of Investigation Academy,
Quantico, VA, and an Adjunct Research Professor, Strategic Studies
Institute, U.S. Army War College. He is also Adjunct Faculty, Division
of Politics and Economics, Claremont Graduate University, and a
Non-Resident Counterterrorism Fellow, TRENDS Research & Advisory, Abu
Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. "Terrorist and Insurgent Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles: Use, Potentials, and Military Implications," *United States
Army War College Press*, August, 2015,
https://www.hsdl.org/?view&did=786817)///JP

While this threat scenario may sound like some-thing from a science
fiction novel, [[the technologies that would allow swarms of autonomous
drones to operate on the future battlefield are already being
developed]{.mark}.]{.underline} One experiment in this regard is being
conducted by Hungarian civilian researchers with the COLLMOT Robotic
Research Project who have "created 10 drones that self-organize as they
move through the air."84 In one example, these drones overcome an
obstacle by maneuvering in line through a choke point. While the
researchers strive that this experimentation is for peaceful pursuits,
[the military benefits of increasingly larger groups of drones that can
self-organize in order to fulfill mission requirements is readily
apparent.]{.underline} Similar experimentation is ongoing with U.S.
Office of Naval Research experiments, which are presently up to 13
autonomous and remote controlled swarming robot boats. As for the
desired project counterterrorism end state, "The Navy officials envision
swarms of unmanned surface vehicles . . . being used to form a defensive
perimeter around larger ships and to surround enemy ships."85 Based on
this projected threat scenario, two variants, utilizing swarms of normal
and micro-sized drones, are foreseen.

[[The full-sized autonomous UAVs incorporated into this scenario variant
are meant to destroy major elements of U.S. power]{.mark} such as the
military aircraft situated at an air base, the armored vehicles
belonging to a brigade combat team, or a major capital ship such as an
aircraft carrier. A massive drone swarm---with each semi-intelligent
drone networked together and outfitted with an explosive warhead---would
be launched against such military targets]{.underline} in this scenario
variant. In the case of the targeting of an aircraft carrier, this
eventual threat may be considered equivalent in scale to the sinking of
captured German battleship Ostfriesland in July 1921 by U.S. Army Air
Service aircraft under the command of Brigadier General William "Billy"
Mitchell. This experiment helped to prove that aircraft carriers would
eventually eclipse battleships as the principle capital ship of navy
forces and suggests, in the present case of drone swarm potentials, that
some sort of stealthy drone carriers may at some point eclipse aircraft
carriers as major surface naval combatants.

The micro-drones that form the basis of this threat scenario variant are
meant to be utilized for anti-personnel rather than anti-materiel
purposes. [Such UAVs range in size from small flying insects to that of
palm-sized devices equivalent in size to small birds]{.underline}.86
Such [micro-UAVs can be outfitted with a host of traditional
weapons---small guns and explosives---as well as un-conventional
armaments such as incapacitators, poisons, and nerve
agents.]{.underline}87 In this scenario variant, [these devices would be
intended for urban terrain with the micro-swarms utilized against
opposing U.S. soldiers. Of concern is the Anti-Access/Area Denial
potentials of such projected micro-drone swarms; however, these UAVs are
presently far too sophisticated for insurgent groups to
develop,]{.underline} much less field.

It is assumed that over time the dozen or so autonomous drones that can
presently self-organize will continue to increase in size into larger
and larger groupings. At what point a large enough grouping of drones
technically becomes a "swarm" is undefined. From a biological
perspective, honeybee swarms range from a few thousand bees into the low
tens of thousands. As an arbitrary threshold, real drone swarms might
therefore be said to require at least a thousand or so individual UAVs.
The operational fielding of such swarms on the battlefield may be viable
within 2 decades.88 While the threat represented by a few hundred
weaponized drones is significant, [[thousands of autonomous
self-organizing UAVs operating on the battlefield would have immense
U.S. national security implications]{.mark}.]{.underline}

It should be noted, however, that the futures represented by Threat
Scenario 3 may or may not be beyond the capability of a terrorist or
insurgent group devoid of state or multinational sponsorship. As a
result, [this capability from a threats perspective may only be
available to advanced states such as China or Russia, technologically
sophisticated multinational corporation equivalent powers, or their
terrorist or insurgent proxies.]{.underline}

Derived from the UAV use threat scenarios, three levels of military
significance are foreseen with terrorist and insurgent activities
associated with these devices. [Because of the technologies that will
eventually be associated with UAVs---robotics and expert (and artificial
intelligence) systems networked together---their significance is
projected to increase over time from the tactical to the operational and
then to the strategic levels of concern.]{.underline} These levels of
military implication and the suggested policy responses related to them
follow.

[[The impact of even singular terrorist UAV use at this level is viewed
as an immediate- and near-term problem]{.mark}.]{.underline} It may
represent more of a domestic security issue than an overseas basing or
deployment threat---although such weaponized devices could just as
easily be utilized for terrorism purposes overseas against service
personnel and their families as they could be used against civilians in
the United States. The tactical level threat derived from the drone-up
shooting, IED crowd targeting, and aircraft takedown scenario variants
will be of concern to domestic law enforcement, homeland security, and
FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force elements.

#### China will flood the market with drones absent US sales -- terrorists will obtain combat drones

**Reimann 2/18** (Jakob Reimann, contributor to Foreign Policy in Focus,
"China is Flooding the Middle East With Cheap Drones," *Foreign Policy
in Focus*, February 18, 2019,
https://fpif.org/china-is-flooding-the-middle-east-with-cheap-drones/)///JP

The last great revolution on the world's battlefields began with the
advent of the drone era.

Particularly in the Middle East, [[the drone became the symbol of the
U.S. empire operating in a legal vacuum]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the
first decade and a half of the "War on Terror," the U.S. still had a
virtual monopoly on the risk-free execution from thousands of meters
above --- but once the genie is out of the bottle, every attempt to
squeeze it back in is notoriously doomed to failure.

And so, quickly [other countries in the region aspired after the
financially --- and politically --- cheap execution by
drone.]{.underline} The number of armies with their own drone fleet is
growing rapidly. [[[A multi-billion-dollar
market](https://www.defensenews.com/air/2017/05/03/global-drone-market-expected-to-surpass-22b-by-2022/)
with astronomical growth rates opened up --- demand that's essentially
served only by one actor: China.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The U.S. has squandered its lead

[[The appearance of the Rainbow CH-4]{.mark} --- the driving force of
Chinese combat drones --- [is [almost
identical](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a22101/chinas-ch-4b-drone-looks-awfully-familiar/)
to the notorious Reaper drone]{.mark} of the U.S. arms manufacturer
General Atomics.]{.underline} While the CH-4 [lags
behind](https://chinapower.csis.org/china-drones-unmanned-technology/)
the Reaper in most performance parameters, it can keep up with or even
outperform its competitor in some of them. Also, the CH-4's weaponry,
[the AKD-10
warhead](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/27/drone-wars-how-the-uaes-chinese-made-drone-is-changing-the-war-in-yemen/),
is almost identical to the Reaper's Hellfire missiles.

[[The striking similarity follows a strategy of Chinese
engineering]{.mark}]{.underline} well-known from cell phones or cars[:
[the look of a world-famous Western branded product is copied with an
inferior but sufficiently good quality compared to that of the
original]{.underline}]{.mark} [--- but at significantly less cost.
Chinese drones are 50 to 75 percent cheaper than the originals from the
U.S.]{.underline}

A late 2015 article published in the Asia Times suggests that this
copying of U.S. technology is likely rooted in Beijing's data theft.
According to records by world-famous NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden,
by 2010 alone "Chinese hackers had conducted [more than 30,000 cyber
attacks](http://www.atimes.com/chinas-armed-drones-appear-built-from-stolen-data-from-us-cyber-intrusions/)"
on Pentagon computer networks and other U.S. military agencies in order
to "exfiltrate \[data on\] sensitive military technology." Although
there is no final proof that data on drones were skimmed off too, Asia
Times quotes then NSA director Gen. Keith Alexander, who suggests that
it is highly likely that the Reaper blueprints were part of the Chinese
data hack, while military experts and analysts largely share this view.

[[With the latest model]{.underline}]{.mark} --- the CH-7, which is
still in the development phase --- [[China could possibly pull ahead the
U.S. for the first time]{.mark},]{.underline} military journal [Defense
One
explains](https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2018/11/chinas-beating-us-market-combat-drones-copying-us-technology/152625/).
[The CH-7 "will be the sole option for buyers wanting to field stealth
combat drones," it predicts. "The United States had a decade-plus head
start on \[drone\] technology,"]{.underline} says military expert Paul
Scharre, ["and has unfortunately squandered that lead."]{.underline}

China captures the market

For a long time, it was only the United States, the United Kingdom, and
Israel that had combat drones and used them to execute alleged
terrorists --- something that has changed dramatically in recent years.

Meanwhile, [[the number of countries with combat drones has swelled to
[at least
29](https://www.newamerica.org/in-depth/world-of-drones/3-who-has-what-countries-armed-drones/),]{.mark}
as research organization New America identifies.]{.underline} And 10
[countries](https://www.newamerica.org/in-depth/world-of-drones/2-who-has-what-countries-drones-used-combat/)
have demonstrably used them to kill suspected enemies; in addition to
the three mentioned, there is Iran, Azerbaijan, the UAE, as well as
Nigeria, Iraq, Pakistan, and Turkey (the last four countries
drone-killed people on their own soil).

Historically, Israel is the largest drone exporter, with a [market share
of over 60 percent](https://drones.rusi.org/countries/israel/) in the
last three decades. More recently, from 2008-2017, [China exported a
total of [88 drones to at least 12
countries](https://chinapower.csis.org/china-drones-unmanned-technology/),
ranking third among the world's drone exporters behind the United States
(351) and Israel (186).]{.underline}

However, [while the vast majority of U.S. and Israeli exports are made
up of unarmed reconnaissance drones, China's sales focus on armed
drones.]{.underline} During the mentioned period, China exported 68
combat drones, putting it ahead of the U.S. (62) and Israel (56).
Foreign Policy thus recently titled rightly: "[China Has Already Won the
Drone
Wars](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/05/10/china-trump-middle-east-drone-wars/)."

All of the armed forces of the Chinese military have [large fleets of
various
drones](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2161354/drones-have-become-part-chinas-military-strategy),
but Beijing has used them so far only for disaster relief, surveillance
of domestic critics, and military reconnaissance --- not to kill. (In
2013, Beijing considered executing by drone a [Myanmar drug
baron](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/21/world/asia/chinese-plan-to-use-drone-highlights-military-advances.html)
wanted in the murders of 13 Chinese sailors, but eventually caught and
tried him.)

Rather, Beijing appears to be establishing a norm permanently
prohibiting lethal drone strikes in East and South Asia. However, this
no-shoot dogma does not prevent the Chinese arms industry from exporting
their drones to states that are patently using them for killing
elsewhere.

How China services U.S. clients

While the Pentagon continues to this day to deliver armed Reaper drones
only to the UK, France, and Italy, purchasers of Chinese combat drones,
[according to Chinese
manufacturers](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/05/10/china-trump-middle-east-drone-wars/),
include Algeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iraq, Jordan, Myanmar, Nigeria,
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan, the UAE, and Zambia. So far, [[the
three largest buyers of Chinese
drones](https://chinapower.csis.org/china-drones-unmanned-technology/)
are Pakistan (with a share of 25 percent) as well as Egypt and
Myanmar]{.underline} (with 23 and 13 percent, respectively). [[Several
of Beijing's buyers are close strategic U.S. allies who have requested
the sale of armed drones from Washington to no avail and have thus
fallen back on Chinese products.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[The U.S. is by far the largest arms exporter and usually sells military
equipment to almost every country in the world.]{.underline} [According
to the SIPRI research
institute](http://justicenow.de/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SIPRI_Arms-Export-USA_2007-2017.xlsx),
the U.S. sold \$98 billion worth of weapons to as many as 112 countries
in 2007-2017. Hence, on the face of it, [[it seems rather
counterintuitive that it would hand over the lucrative battle drone
market to China.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[A recent report by the
DIA](https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/01/pentagon-mideast-turning-china-drone-needs.html),
the Pentagon's internal intelligence service, deals with this
contradiction. "China is a niche provider of armed \[drones\]" in the
Middle East, the report acknowledges, and correctly concludes that
"China faces little competition" as it is not a member of international
export control regimes.]{.underline} In fact, unlike the U.S. and the
European arms-exporting countries, [[China is not a contracting party to
the [Missile Technology Control
Regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Technology_Control_Regime#Members)
(MTRC), which]{.mark} strictly regulates the proliferation of combat
drones and [makes U.S. drone exports to the Middle East more
difficult]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In addition to attempts by the Trump administration to amend the MTRC,
Trump's State Department published a [new export
policy](https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2018/04/280619.htm) in April
2018: "We will remove barriers to the global \[drone\] market and avoid
ceding export opportunities to competitors where such self-imposed
restrictions are unwarranted."

Since the wording does not specify when restrictions are "unwarranted,"
the new policy can be understood as blank approval for future drone
exports. De facto, it was also made possible to buy combat drones
directly from the manufacturer, [without the government as a broker
agent](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/06/trump-push-to-boost-lethal-drone-exports-reaps-few-rewards-uas-mtcr/).
"To date, however, that hasn't led to any reported sales to the Middle
East," Forbes
[reported](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2018/12/17/china-fueling-drones-arms-race-middle-east/)
late last year.

So, [in contrast to relatively strict regulations on U.S. drone exports,
China's "[no questions
asked](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2018/12/17/china-fueling-drones-arms-race-middle-east/)"
policy allowed it to quickly gain a foothold in the lucrative Middle
East drone market and aggressively expand the course of the
proliferation of cheap drones.]{.underline}

State-of-the-art technology perceived as revolutionary always comes with
a certain adulation for its possessor. Thus, a recent report by
London-based military think tank RUSI concludes that ["[national
prestige and
status](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/drones-1687746893) is the
main reason that most states" in the Middle East increasingly acquire
[drones]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Middle East Eye reports. However, in
addition to their value as status symbols, in recent years they are
[[more and more being used strategically [on the battlefields of the
region](https://www.voanews.com/a/report-china-driving-use-of-armed-drones-in-middle-east/4704022.html)]{.mark},
which the RUSI report [attributes largely to increased Chinese
exports.]{.mark}]{.underline}

And so Chinese drones also recorded their first deaths: Besides fatal
deployment by the [Nigerian
army](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2018/10/03/chinese-armed-drones-now-flying-over-mideast-battlefields-heres-why-theyre-gaining-on-us-drones/)
against Boko Haram, since the end of 2015, the Iraqi military performed
more than [260 air
strikes](http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/chinas-drones-are-taking-isis-heres-why-america-should-worry-24581)
against Islamic State targets with Chinese drones. They gained
particular infamy on April 22 last year, when the UAE [executed the de
facto president of
Yemen](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/27/drone-wars-how-the-uaes-chinese-made-drone-is-changing-the-war-in-yemen/),
Saleh Ali al-Sammad, with a Chinese drone, escalating the nearly
four-year war in the country. The murdered Al-Sammad was seen as a
promoter of the UN-mediated peace process in Yemen, whereas his
successor, Mahdi al-Mashat, is an implacable, uncompromising hardliner
and provocateur.

Pandora's box is open

[Of particular concern is China's drone policy in Saudi
Arabia.]{.underline}

A \$ 65 billion economic program clinched between the two countries in
spring 2017 includes the construction of a [Chinese drone factory in
Saudi
Arabia](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2081869/chinese-drone-factory-saudi-arabia-first-middle-east)
--- the first of its kind in the region. Initially, the license
production of [300
drones](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/drones-1687746893) was
agreed, which represents a massive figure given the 88 drones that China
has exported in the last decade altogether.

However[, [the license drones are not exclusively intended for the Saudi
Royal Air Force --- Riyadh can explicitly [market them to other
countries](https://www.israeldefense.co.il/en/node/29253) in the
region]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} End-user certificates do not
exist for deals with Beijing. [In view of the fact that [Saudi Arabia,
along with supporting various jihadist groups in the region, is [a close
ally of Al Qaeda in
Yemen](http://justicenow.de/2018-03-18/des-westen-als-treuer-verbuendeter-der-al-qaida/)]{.mark},
it is within the realm of possibility to envision some of these drones
end up in terrorist's hands. [Fueled by Beijing's export policy, the
threat scenario of drone-armed jihadists has moved significantly
closer.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Research by the Jamestown Foundation shows that [[we have already
entered the era of "[unmanned
terrorism](https://jamestown.org/program/entering-era-unmanned-terrorism/)]{.mark}."
Groups commonly labelled as "terrorists" from Syria, Iraq, and
Afghanistan to Gaza, Lebanon, and Yemen are already using mini-drones to
drop bombs, grenades, and incendiary devices onto enemy positions or
civilian facilities. [Further flooding the region with cheap combat
drones from China will certainly heave these tactics to the next level
in the future]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Since 2001, [thousands of people, most of them civilians, have been
killed by drone in the so-called "War on Terror,]{.underline}" changing
the nature of war in its entirety and exposing civilians in all these
undeclared war zones to a permanent threat on their lives. Nobel Peace
Prize laureate Barack Obama proved he could always escape punishment and
international condemnation even after using drones to [turn weddings and
funerals into blood baths and mass
graves](https://roarmag.org/essays/obama-legacy-war-conflict-peace/).
And so, [the desires of local actors to acquire these practical killing
tools were aroused, too.]{.underline}

[[The Chinese leadership is exploiting these developments without
compromise and flooding the Middle East with cheap drones.]{.mark} The
consequences of this expansionary policy cannot be
foreseen.]{.underline}

#### China is selling armed drones -- those end up in the wrong hands

**Stephens 18** (Hampton Stephens, founder of World Politics Review,
"Armed Drones, Killer Robots, and the New Arms Race," *World Politics
Review*, December 7, 2018,

[If the Trump administration is worried about an unlevel playing field,
it is due to the increase in drone sales by countries with
less-selective criteria for their potential customers, such as
China]{.underline}. For the most part, China's arms industry does not
seriously threaten U.S. arms exports, at least not in terms of quantity.
That said, [[there are some areas where China is breaking new ground in
the global arms trade, both in terms of new customers and new
products.]{.underline}]{.mark} It has sold frigates to Algeria, trainer
jets to Bolivia and Venezuela, and anti-ship missiles to Indonesia. More
troubling, however, [[China has quite suddenly become a key exporter of
armed drones]{.mark}, also referred to as unmanned combat aerial
vehicles]{.underline}, or UCAVs[. It's troubling, not only because it
positions China to challenge the U.S. in a potentially lucrative segment
of the arms business that is likely to grow significantly over the
coming decades. [Armed drones are]{.mark} also [a growing proliferation
concern,]{.mark} given that they are extremely effective and
increasingly the weapon of choice on many battlefields.]{.underline}

[Since their emergence as a central part of America's war on terror,
drones have gone from a battlefield innovation to a tool accessible to
unsavory groups or characters on the streets.]{.underline} As Homeland
Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen recently said in a speech outlining
the five major areas of concern to her department, until recently a
drone "was the hot toy on wish lists. But today, [[it's a major national
security concern in our homeland]{.mark}.]{.underline}" Does the threat
from drones warrant its place on this list? Is it really a concern that
should keep Nielsen "up at night," as she said? The reality is that
drones do bring asymmetric advantages to groups with few resources, but
they are more likely to be a tool of disruption rather than destruction.
And how drones went from being an American counterterrorism tool to a
homeland security threat has a longer history than Nielsen suggested.

[[The proliferation of drones has raised alarm over the possibility of
completely autonomous systems]{.mark}, or "killer robots," being
deployed in the near future]{.underline}. That in turn has led to a
campaign by activists and NGOs to ban such systems. But any success on
banning "killer robots" will not be immediate and may require activists
to adjust their expectations. Divergent national interests and murky
ethical questions make regulating autonomous weapons a difficult
proposition. [[Countries are far from consensus on how and even whether
to regulate these fast-emerging technologies]{.mark}.]{.underline} But
while killer robots are a far cry from today's armed drones---and still
a long way off---the issue is shaping up to be one of the 21st century's
defining international debates.

#### China is pursuing swarm technology now

[While starting to incorporate greater degrees of autonomy into its
high-end UAVs, [the Chinese defense industry has pursued options for
manned-unmanned teaming and multi-UAV operations]{.mark}.]{.underline}
The TYW-1, the export version of the BZK-005, a high-altitude
long-endurance (HALE) UAV used primarily for reconnaissance by the PLA
Navy (PLAN) and PLA Air Force (PLAAF), can operate with a high degree of
automation, taking off and landing independently, requiring minimal
human intervention in tracking and attacking targets.149The ASN-216, in
use with the PLAN, is also capable of autonomous (自主) takeoff and
landing, flight, and filming.150In addition, the Caihong-5 ("Rainbow,"
CH-5), a HALE UAV, could have the capacity to team with other UAVs for
multi-drone missions.151Beihang University, closely linked to military
aerospace technologies, is pursuing research on the control,
collaboration, and management of multiple manned and unmanned
systems.152

[[The Chinese defense industry has achieved significant advances in
swarm intelligence and appears likely to continue to progress in this
technique.]{.mark} During the fall 2016 Zhuhai Airshow, [official media
prominently featured Chinese breakthroughs in swarm
intelligence.]{.mark} To date, the efforts of CETC appear to be most
prominent.]{.underline} In November 2016, CETC, in partnership with
Tsinghua University and Poisson Technology (泊松技术), [a private
company, revealed its progress in swarm intelligence with a formation of
67 small fixed-wing UAVs utilizing autonomous swarm control, with
communication and coordination among UAVs]{.underline}.153,154In the
spring of 2017, a formation of 1,000 UAVs at the Guangzhou Airshow by
another private company reportedly again broke records.155At the time,
[military experts quoted in Chinese media similarly highlighted that
this technique could be used to create a distributed system with payload
modules mounted on small drones]{.underline}.156However, [the actual
sophistication of this particular demonstration --and the potential
linkage to military efforts --is unclear.]{.underline} Once again, in
June 2017, CETC demonstrated its advances in swarm intelligence with the
test of 119 fixed-wing UAVs, beating its previous record of 67. [[This
swarm engaged in catapult-assisted takeoffs and demonstrated complex
formation]{.mark}s]{.underline}.157At the time, CETC commentary
highlighted that [[swarm intelligence is the future of intelligent
unmanned systems]{.mark}, and CETC UAV expert Zhao Yanjie]{.underline}
(赵彦杰) [characterized future intelligent swarms as a disruptive force
to "change the rules of the game" in warfare.]{.underline}158

[At present, multiple military and civilian research institutes appear
to be working on swarm intelligence and manned-unmanned
teaming.]{.underline} These include, but are not limited to, several
CETC research institutes; the China Aerospace Science and Industry
Corporation (CASIC), including its Third Institute's UAV Technology
Research Institute; the Harbin Institute of Technology's National Key
Laboratory of Robotic Systems and Engineering; Tsinghua University;
Beihang University, and Northwest Polytechnic University, based on their
published research and patents on the topic.159In September 2017, the
PLAAF Equipment Department 2016 announced an upcoming "challenge" for
intelligent UAV swarm systems, in which competitors will be judged on
the sophistication of the performance of their swarms.160[The PLA is
also funding research on data link technologies for swarm UAVs and the
use of deep learning to enhance the control, collaboration, and
management of multiple manned and unmanned systems.]{.underline}161

[Future PLA swarms could be used for reconnaissance, strike, jamming,
and other missions.]{.underline} For instance, [CGI sequence available
in media reports about the CETC demonstration showed a swarm formation
in action, first hunting and then dive-bombing and destroying an enemy
missile launcher]{.underline}.162This technique would possess advantages
in efficiency and survivability, due to the distribution of capabilities
across the system, as well as lower costs for offense relative to the
difficulty of defending against a swarm.[163[These intelligent unmanned
systems could serve as an asymmetric means through which to target
high-value U.S. weapons platforms, including fighter jets or aircraft
carriers]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} Of note, [China's Military
Museum includes in one exhibit a depiction of a UAV swarm combat
system]{.underline} (无人机蜂群作战系统) [with swarms used for
reconnaissance, jamming, and "swarm assault" (群打击) targeting an
aircraft carrier.]{.underline}164

[[Imagine swarms of undersea, surface, and aerial drones hunting
submarines]{.mark} hidden in the vastness of the ocean. Or imagine
hundreds of airborne drones darting through New York City, [seeking out
targets and dosing them with nerve agent.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[These imaginary scenarios are not yet reality, but [they are quickly
becoming so]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Drone swarm technology could have a significant impact on every area
of military competition]{.mark}, from enhancing supply chains to
[delivering nuclear bombs]{.mark}]{.underline}. This article examines
the implications for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear
(CBRN) weapons. Some applications are already possible, while others are
futuristic, but plausible. Our [broader
study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10736700.2018.1546902)
in the Nonproliferation Review on the applications of drone swarms to
CBRN weapons offers additional analysis.

[[Drone swarms offer significant improvements to]{.mark} both [nuclear
offense,]{.mark} the ability to successfully deliver a warhead to a
target, and defense, the ability to prevent successful delivery and
mitigate consequences.]{.underline} When it comes to chemical and
biological weapons, [[drone swarms]{.mark} can improve both defense and
offense, but [appear to strongly favor offense]{.mark} by addressing key
challenges to delivery. In the future, this could weaken the norms
against these weapons and encourage proliferation.]{.underline} U.S.
national security agencies should act to combat the threat and take
advantage of the opportunities this new technology offers for CBRN
weapons.

Military Advantages of Drone Swarms

Precisely defined, [drone swarms
are](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10736700.2018.1546902)
"multiple unmanned platforms and/or weapons deployed to accomplish a
shared objective, with the platforms and/or weapons autonomously
altering their behavior based on communication with one another."

The fact that components of the swarm can communicate with one another
makes the [swarm different from just a group of individual
drones](https://warontherocks.com/2015/03/unleash-the-swarm-the-future-of-warfare/).
Communication allows the swarm to adjust behavior in response to
real-time information. [Drones equipped with cameras and other
environmental sensors ("sensor drones") can identify potential targets,
environmental hazards, or defenses and [relay that
information](https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.cnas.org/documents/CNAS_TheComingSwarm_Scharre.pdf?mtime=20160906082059)
to the rest of the swarm.]{.underline} The swarm may then maneuver to
avoid a hazard or defense, or a weapon-equipped drone [(an "attack
drone") may strike the target or defense.]{.underline} Real-time
information collection makes drone swarms well-suited for searching over
broad areas for mobile or other hard-to-find units.

But [swarming also adds new vulnerabilities.]{.underline} Drone swarms
are particularly vulnerable to electronic warfare attacks. Because drone
swarms are dependent on drone-to-drone communication, disrupting that
signal also disrupts the swarm. As swarms become more sophisticated,
they will also be more vulnerable to cyberattack. [Adversaries may
attempt to [hijack the
swarm](https://warontherocks.com/2015/03/counter-swarm-a-guide-to-defeating-robotic-swarms/)
by, for example, feeding it false information, hacking, or generating
manipulative environmental signals.]{.underline} Although numerous
counter-drone systems are in development, [current defenses do not
appear
sufficient](https://warontherocks.com/2018/08/the-perfect-can-wait-good-solutions-to-the-drone-swarm-problem/)
and even promising systems will face scalability challenges, from
deployment allocation to training, in the system's use.

Analysts are divided on whether drone swarms offer significant cost
benefits. T.X. Hammes has posited in War on the Rocks that [the future
of warfare is "[small, smart, and cheap
platforms](https://warontherocks.com/2014/07/the-future-of-warfare-small-many-smart-vs-few-exquisite/)."
He highlights swarms of drones as one example, arguing the costs are
already low and likely to become lower.]{.underline} But [Shmuel Shmuel
disagrees](https://warontherocks.com/2018/09/the-coming-swarm-might-be-dead-on-arrival/),
arguing in a skeptical essay that this new technology will be more
expensive to operationalize than most think.

Ultimately, [the cost and its relevance depend in part on what role the
swarm will play and what alternatives are available.]{.underline} Even
[multimillion-dollar drone swarms can be cost-effective on balance if
they meaningfully increase the survivability of more expensive or
particularly crucial platforms]{.underline}, such as aircraft carriers
or nuclear deterrent forces. Simple, low-cost drones may also fill
capability gaps, such as the Marine Corps' interest in [small, tactical
drones](https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/your-marine-corps/2019/01/18/the-corps-is-going-all-in-on-small-tactical-drones-as-it-preps-for-future-war/)
and drone swarms to provide [infantry organic close-air-support and
reconnaissance](https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/your-marine-corps/2018/07/20/the-corps-wants-15-suicide-drones-swarming-from-the-hands-of-one-front-line-marine/).

Nuclear Deterrence

Drone swarm technology has significant implications for both the
offensive and defensive sides of the nuclear deterrence equation.

Swarms offer new means of defeating traditional nuclear delivery systems
--- a defensive advantage[.]{.underline} They could serve as novel
missile defenses, potentially even against hypersonic missiles. Imagine
100,000 cheap, simple drones forming a dome over a high-value target.
Any incoming missile, no matter how fast or maneuverable, would likely
hit a drone (whether lightweight drones are enough to damage a reentry
vehicle or throw it off course is an open question). [The same drones
could also serve effectively as [air
mines](https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/ASPJ/journals/Volume-31_Issue-1/V-Hauck_Geis.pdf),
colliding with or exploding in the vicinity of incoming bombers. Even
small drones can [significantly
damage](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/nation-now/2018/10/17/drones-crashing-into-airplanes-quadcopters-damage-video/1657112002/)
airplane wings. This could be especially effective against low-flying
bombers because there is less airspace to cover and defenders can use
short-range drones.]{.underline} Finally, [multi-domain swarms of
undersea, surface, and/or aerial drones could search the ocean for
adversary submarines.]{.underline} The drones might locate, follow,
relay information about, or attack the submarines. They also could draw
information from broader sensor networks.

However, [[drone swarms also offer new means to improve nuclear
delivery]{.underline}]{.mark} --- that is, nuclear offense. [States are
already pursuing [drone delivery
systems](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/russian-navy-will-soon-deploy-32-poseidon-nuclear-drones-across-4-submarines-41617)
for nuclear weapons,  and drone swarms can also improve existing nuclear
delivery systems without being armed with a nuclear weapon.]{.underline}
Just as they may be able to serve as air and missile defenses, [drone
swarms can be used to defeat, disable, or trick those same
defenses.]{.underline} While it's true that air and missile defenses are
highly mobile, creating [significant
challenges](http://www.airuniversity.af.mil/Portals/10/ASPJ/journals/Volume-30_Issue-2/F-Bucki.pdf)
for locating and destroying them, [drone swarms have the advantage of
being able to spread out broadly to search for them.]{.underline} Along
the same lines, Israel used [drones as
decoys](https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a421980.pdf) to trick
Syrian air defenses into believing they were Israeli aircraft. [Drone
swarms could do the same in larger, more distributed numbers to
encourage defenses to hit the drones instead of the delivery systems
carrying nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons.]{.underline} Drone
swarms would move more effectively as a unit, akin to how groups of
actual aircraft would behave.

[Swarms may also improve nuclear targeting. Drones can be used to
collect information to identify vulnerabilities or previously unknown
defenses.]{.underline} Traditional delivery systems such as cruise
missiles, while not technically drones, might incorporate drone swarm
technology to adjust their approach en route, for instance based on
other systems' success or failure in striking targets. This is
especially useful for counterforce strikes against an adversary's
military, which hinge on accurate and comprehensive target
identification and precise strikes on those targets. [Improved targeting
is less important for second strikes and countervalue strikes, which
target cities and civilians.]{.underline} Additionally, [more accurate
weapons mean fewer warheads and delivery systems would be needed.
Targeting improvements may also lower upkeep or other
costs.]{.underline}

In this way, [drone swarm technology could make nuclear delivery systems
either more or less survivable, depending on who uses the technology and
how.]{.underline} Delivery system survivability is critical to nuclear
stability. [A nuclear threat is less credible if the threatened state
believes it can reliably defeat the nuclear system. And on the other
hand, [if a state believes its nuclear delivery systems can be defeated,
it may develop and deploy more nuclear weapons and novel delivery
systems, as well as act more aggressively in crises and
conflicts]{.mark}.]{.underline} Such concerns underlie [Russia's
objections](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/nato-russia-missile-defense-compromise-is-possible/)
to U.S. ballistic missile defenses. This was also a key reason the
United States and others have pursued multiple means of delivering
nuclear weapons: to ensure nuclear weapons could always survive a first
strike.

Will drone swarms ultimately improve nuclear offense more than they
would improve nuclear defense? It's unclear. But theoretically,
[emerging technologies that improve the ability to defeat nuclear
weapons are more disruptive to overall nuclear competition than
improvements to delivery.]{.underline} Nuclear weapons already inflict
such significant damage that delivery improvements are unlikely to
fundamentally alter the character of nuclear warfare. If North Korea can
significantly deter the United States with a small, simple nuclear
arsenal, for instance, delivery systems improvements seem unlikely to
alter the fundamental dynamic. Therefore, while drone swarm technology
could aid attacking states, the improvements for defenders are likely to
matter more.

Chemical and Biological Weapons Proliferation

[[Drone swarm technology is likely to encourage chemical and biological
weapons proliferation]{.mark} and improve the capabilities of states
that already possess these weapons. [**Terrorist organizations are also
likely to be interested in the technology**,]{.mark} especially more
sophisticated actors like the Islamic State, which has already [shown
interest](https://ctc.usma.edu/app/uploads/2016/10/Drones-Report.pdf) in
drone-based chemical and biological weapons attacks.]{.underline} Drone
swarms may also aid counter-proliferation, prevention, and response to a
chemical or biological attack, but those applications appear less
significant than the offensive applications.

Indeed, [swarms have the potential to significantly improve chemical and
biological weapons delivery. Sensor drones could collect environmental
data to improve targeting, and attack drones could use this information
in the timing and positioning for release, target selection, and
approach]{.underline}. For example, attack drones may release the agent
earlier than planned based on shifts in wind conditions assessed by
sensor drones.

[Dispersed attacks also allow for more careful targeting. Instead of
spraying large masses of agent, drones could search for and target
individuals or specific vulnerabilities such as air ventilation
systems.]{.underline} This also means the drones would not need to carry
as much agent.

Moreover, [drone swarms enable the use of combined arms
tactics]{.underline}. Some attack drones within the swarm could be
equipped with chemical or biological payloads, while others could carry
conventional weapons. Chemical or biological attack drones might strike
first to force adversary troops into protective gear that inhibits
movement, then follow up with conventional strikes. Although [combined
arms tactics are possible with current delivery systems, [drone swarms
allow much closer integration between conventional and unconventional
weapons.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[These improvements in chemical and biological delivery could
conceivably weaken both the military and moral justifications for the
[relative](https://www.amazon.com/Living-Weapons-Biological-International-Security/dp/0801477522/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1550089449&sr=1-1)

As far as military utility goes, [chemical and especially biological
weapons](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1009.3035&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
are often unreliable modes of attack. Environmental and territorial
conditions such as precipitation, wind, humidity, and vegetation reduce
the efficacy of the agent, while protective gear may significantly or
wholly mitigate the harm they cause. But [drone-based environmental
sensors could make these weapons much more reliable, while combined arms
tactics could mitigate the impact of, or even gain advantage from,
adversary use of protective gear.]{.underline}

## 1NC Fill In CP- China

#### CP Text: The United States federal government should substantially increase its sale of drones

#### The counterplan solves MTCR credibility and prevents Chinese fill in

**Hudson 7/8** (Arthur Hudson, Senior Fellow at the Hudson Institute,
"The Treaty Behind China's Drone Edge," *Wall Street Journal*, July 8,
2019,
https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-treaty-behind-chinas-drone-edge-11562626340)///JP

The recent Iranian shootdown of an American RQ-4 Global Hawk
surveillance drone has underlined the escalating tension between U.S.
and Iran in the Persian Gulf. It also shows how ubiquitous and necessary
unmanned aerial vehicles have become for America's military missions.
Yet [the U.S. may cede the future of these large UAVs to competitors
such as China, Russia and, ironically, Iran, if we don't change how we
develop and deploy these systems.]{.underline}

The media has trained Americans to think of military drones primarily as
tools for finding and killing terrorists. In fact, they handle a much
broader range of missions, from gathering intelligence and watching hot
spots like the Strait of Hormuz to monitoring weather patterns and
disaster relief. These so-called autonomous systems are quiet and
relatively inconspicuous and can stay aloft for 20 to 30 hours at a
time. [Given their growing importance for keeping the armed forces and
intelligence services informed 24/7---and since similar systems will
soon become part of the U.S. commercial aircraft fleet---almost every
expert agrees they are the future of the aerospace
industry.]{.underline}

Yet [thanks to a single outdated provision of an obscure international
agreement formed in 1987---the Missile Technology Control Regime, or
MTCR---the U.S. may lose leadership to China and Iran of the large-drone
market, which is expected to grow to \$32 billion in 10
years.]{.underline} The problem is that [the treaty includes drones in
the category of missile technology capable of carrying a 500-kilogram
payload at least 300 kilometers. MTCR signatories like the U.S. are
forbidden to export drones with that capacity, even to trusted
allies.]{.underline}

That restriction dates to 1992, when unmanned aircraft were essentially
target drones. The fear was that they'd be used for kamikaze-style
terrorist attacks. That worry proved unfounded. [What it means today is
that U.S. allies like South Korea and Britain can't buy Global Hawks or
Predators except through special executive waiver, a time-consuming
bureaucratic process.]{.underline}

This means that [good actors are denied the vast progress UAV technology
has made in the U.S. since 1992, advances that have made large drones
faster, safer and more versatile.]{.underline}

[**China has stepped into the vacuum**. Beijing isn't an MTCR signatory
and so is free to sell large drones world-wide---including to Egypt and
the United Arab Emirates after the U.S. had to turn down their requests
for American drones, thanks to the MTCR. The Chinese drones are based on
technology stolen from American companies, naturally.]{.underline}

A January report from the Defense Intelligence Agency pointed out that
[China has become a niche supplier of armed drones to putative American
allies, and noted that because of the MTCR, "China faces little
competition for sale of such systems."]{.underline}

[Iran, also not an MTCR signatory, similarly sees an economic and
strategic opportunity in the large-drone market. It has been building
unmanned systems suitable for export---also based on stolen U.S.
technology]{.underline}---according to the Times of Israel.

[Export sales are essential to a robust made-in-America drone industry,
which will need to include commercial-aircraft as well as defense
systems.]{.underline} American companies and workers won't be the only
losers if the rules don't change. Human-rights critics often worry that
[the U.S. military's reliance on drones will lead to a Big Brother-like
surveillance state that uses this technology for inhuman and tyrannical
ends. Leaving the drone market to China and Iran makes that outcome more
likely.]{.underline}

The Trump administration can do two things to reverse this situation.
[First, the U.S. can make clear that Iran won't get away with this kind
of provocation by stepping up UAV overflights, both to track what's
happening in the Hormuz Strait and to show that the U.S., not Iran or
China, still leads the world in this technology]{.underline}.

[Second, it's time to cross drones out of the MTCR's restrictions on
missile technology, by executive order if necessary. Let aircraft be
aircraft, and missiles be missiles: The two should never be intermingled
in the same control regime.]{.underline}

The administration has proposed compromise changes, such as excluding
drones that travel at less than 600 miles an hour from the banned
category, but that doesn't go far enough. [Incrementalism has allowed
bureaucratic backsliding---especially at the State Department, which
still makes selling an unarmed drone to an ally impossible, even when
the same country can buy F-15 or F-16 fighters.]{.underline}

[Defenders of the status quo claim changing the MTCR rules might weaken
ballistic-missile nonproliferation.]{.underline} In fact, [it would
strengthen it by allowing the proliferation of aircraft that can help
detect missile launches over, for example, North Korea. It would also
help the U.S. and its allies keep watch on nations, especially North
Korea and Iran, whose ballistic-missile capabilities pose a real
threat]{.underline}---not a phantom threat like American-made drones.

[The administration can take decisive action today that makes clear that
in the field of aerospace, America is going to lead in the 21st century
as it did in the 20th---and will do so to serve the cause of freedom and
justice against tyranny and oppression.]{.underline}

#### Exempting drones from export controls is the only option to strengthen the MTCR -- the alternative is an increasing loss of credibility

**Horowitz 17** (Michael C. Horowitz, associate professor of political
science and the associate director of Perry World House at the
University of Pennsylvania. "Drones aren't missiles, so don't regulate
them like they are," *Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists*, June 26, 2017,
https://thebulletin.org/2017/06/drones-arent-missiles-so-dont-regulate-them-like-they-are/)///JP

[Current-generation drones, however, are much more akin to aircraft than
missiles, because they are recoverable airframes designed to conduct
increasingly sophisticated surveillance missions or launch weapons at a
target and then return to]{.underline} base. The MTCR was never intended
to regulate aircraft, a ubiquitous technology that cannot be controlled
with export regimes. [Regulating the export of drones and drone parts
using range and payload standards relevant for missiles represents a
mismatch between technology and reality]{.underline}, which could have
negative effects. [**Advanced and armed drones are proliferating
rapidly, many exported by China**. **Drone proliferation threatens to
undermine the MTCR as a whole,** signaling its general lack of
effectiveness]{.underline}, if the regime purports to control the
technology while clearly failing to do so. [Sustaining the original
intent of the regime---to halt or at least slow the spread of missiles
capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction---may therefore
require a [new path
forward](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/drone-proliferation).
Placing drones in the same exempt category as crewed aircraft would
reflect the technological reality and help preserve the integrity of the
regime.]{.underline}

How does the MTCR work? [The MTCR seeks to prevent the spread of
[Category
I](http://mtcr.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MTCR-TEM-Technical_Annex_2016-10-20.pdf)
missile systems, or missiles that can travel more than 300 kilometers
(km) and carry a payload of more than 500 kilograms (kg).]{.underline}
Under the regime's guidelines, members are [not permitted to
export](http://mtcr.info/frequently-asked-questions-faqs/) Category I
items except on rare occasions. (The phrase used by the regime is that
there is a "strong presumption of denial" against exporting such
systems.) Compliance is voluntary, though states commit to announcing
any Category I exports. Given that [many airplanes can also travel more
than 300 km and carry a payload of more than 500 kg, [crewed aircraft
are
exempt](http://mtcr.info/frequently-asked-questions-faqs/).]{.underline}

Though it is not a treaty, making it more informal than agreements such
as the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, many analysts believe that the
MTCR has played at least a modestly useful role in restricting
long-range missile proliferation. Long-range rocket engines and guidance
systems are
[difficult](http://allthingsnuclear.org/dwright/why-icbms-are-hard-to-build) to
design and build. Given the technological hurdles necessary to acquire
long-range missiles and the membership of nearly all advanced missile
producers in the MTCR, voluntary compliance has meaningfully moved the
needle. Even the People's Republic of China, though not a member, has
committed itself to following MTCR guidelines since 1991.

Drone evolution. If current-generation drones are more like crewed
aircraft than other systems, how did they end up wrapped up in the MTCR
in the first place? [Drones were once considered a subset of cruise
missiles because they had active guidance, and were generally used for
target practice. However, developments in drone technology over the last
few decades mean that the real-world uses of drones by national
militaries bear little if any resemblance to the technologies of the
late 1980s and early 1990s.]{.underline} The regime originally included
drones out of fear they could be used as cruise missiles armed with
weapons of mass destruction. Today's drones, though, are much more like
aircraft than cruise missiles. Like aircraft, drones such as China's
CH-4, Israel's Heron TP, or the United States's [MQ-9
Reaper](http://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104470/mq-9-reaper/)
can stay in the air for hours or days to conduct surveillance missions,
and they increasingly have the ability to launch precision-guided
missiles, such as the Hellfire in the case of the MQ-9 Reaper. The RQ-4
Global Hawk used by the United States even carries much of the same
surveillance equipment as the crewed U-2 aircraft. [While one could
still put a weapon of mass destruction on a drone and fly it into a
target, rather than use it as a recoverable airframe, the same is true
of aircraft.]{.underline}

Yet [the MTCR has not changed, meaning that members including the United
States subject themselves to [export control rules for
drones](https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/02/237541.htm)]{.underline}
with range (300km) and payload (500kg) restrictions meant to apply to
missiles. [These restrictions are arbitrary when applied to
current-generation drones, since they do not represent any meaningful
break-point in capability.]{.underline} Furthermore, [given that drone
technology continues to advance, **the conceptual mismatch between the
reality of military drones and their inclusion in the MTCR will only
become clearer in the years ahead**.]{.underline} The restrictions also
mean that, functionally, [it is harder for a country such as the United
States to export an unarmed MQ-9 Reaper drone to a NATO ally than it is
to sell them an F-35, precision guided munitions, or a
tank.]{.underline}

A path forward. Politically there is no easy way to proceed, because the
MTCR operates by consensus, but [an exemption for drones similar to the
one for crewed aircraft could represent a credible step forward. Such an
exemption would reflect today's technological realities and help the
regime]{.underline} move forward. The goal should be to strengthen its
ability to do what it was designed to do in the first place: prevent the
spread of long-range ballistic and cruise missiles with the ability to
deliver weapons of mass destruction.

A substantive criticism of this proposal might be that, even if
including drones in the MTCR is arbitrary based on the reality of
today's technology, an overly restrictive policy is good because it
helps prevent the spread of systems that could be used for targeted
killings or domestic repression. Unfortunately, [the current approach to
drones within the MTCR framework is not substantially limiting drone
proliferation]{.underline}, as a [new
report](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/drone-proliferation)
from the Center for a New American Security makes clear. (Full
disclosure: I am one of the authors of the report.) [Drone exports are
increasing anyway, and both states and non-state actors have a growing
ability to use commercial technology to build their own armed
drones.]{.underline} Put another way, [**[drone proliferation is
inevitable]{.underline}**](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/droning-on-explaining-the-proliferation-of-unmanned-aerial-vehicles/8982612535696D00F6D040DB56C741AF): About
[17 countries already have armed drone capabilities and more than a
dozen are pursuing them. Of those countries, six or seven have acquired
them in just the last two years, meaning **the rate of proliferation is
accelerating.**]{.underline}

The United States has only exported armed drones to one country, the
United Kingdom, though it also approved a sale that would arm previously
unarmed MQ-9 Reaper drones it [sold to
Italy](http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/air-space/strike/2015/11/05/italy-wins-us-state-dept-ok-arm-its-reapers/75242852/)
in 2011. [China, however, has reportedly exported armed drones to 10
countries]{.underline} (Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Myanmar,
Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan, and the United Arab
Emirates), [and another six countries have built armed drones
themselves]{.underline} (China,
[Iran](http://www.thedailybeast.com/drone-war-heats-up-in-the-skies-over-syria),
Israel, Russia, Turkey, and the United States). [Iran has allegedly
[exported
drones](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/12/world/middleeast/hassan-nasrallah-says-hezbollah-flew-iranian-designed-drone-into-israel.html) to
Hezbollah, a non-state militant group.]{.underline} Essentially,
[suppliers exist that can deliver [significant
capabilities](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/ISEC_a_00257),
and countries are beginning to have success at designing their own
advanced and armed drones.]{.underline}

Moreover, [to claim technical compliance with MTCR guidelines, the armed
drones China exports (the CH-3, Wing-Loong, and CH-4B) tend to have
publicly announced payloads that fall just under 500 kg]{.underline}.
(Countries voluntarily declare whether their platforms pass the Category
I threshold, but there is no way to verify whether their statements
about payload size are accurate.) Similarly, later this year, the
Israeli firm IAI will
[deliver](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/india-all-set-to-get-missile-armed-drones-from-israel/articleshow/57980098.cms)
10 armed Heron TP drones to India as part of a contract signed in 2015.
IAI says that the exported variant of the Heron TP has a payload of [450
kg](http://www.defensenews.com/articles/iai-to-debut-mtcr-compliant-heron-tp), in
contrast to the more capable Israeli-operated variant, which is a
Category I system. Why does this matter? [There is nothing inherently
consequential about the difference between 450 kg and 500 kg when it
comes to the capabilities of a current-generation drone]{.underline}. In
fact, [what enables a country to operate a drone effectively is not a 50
kg difference in payload, but whether it has the organizational capacity
to integrate large amounts of intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance data in real time]{.underline}. Nevertheless,
[**continued gaming of the system undermines the MTCR as a whole** by
demonstrating that it cannot succeed over time in significantly
restricting the number of states with militarily relevant
drones.]{.underline}

[If drone proliferation is inevitable, the logic of using arbitrary and
overly restrictive MTCR guidelines to govern their export is
unpersuasive]{.underline}. Rather than making drone proliferation less
likely, [the MTCR as presently constructed simply shifts who supplies
armed drones, and incentivizes countries to develop their
own.]{.underline}

A threat to the MTCR. Inaction also creates risks. The current approach
to grouping drones in the MTCR threatens to undermine the regime as a
whole.

First, [it links two disparate issues, drones on the one hand and cruise
or ballistic missiles on the other, so that exports by MTCR members of
the former could undermine the regime's rules against exporting the
latter.]{.underline} Countries seeking to sell surveillance drones to
allies, for example, could see their exports used by another member to
justify that member's ballistic missile sales.

Second, [the spread of drones despite the MTCR framework undermines its
perceived effectiveness.]{.underline}

Third, [the MTCR is under pressure from other avenues.
Intermediate-range cruise and ballistic missiles could represent an
important capability for US allies and partners seeking to build their
capacity to impose costs on potential aggressors, especially in the
Pacific. Addressing the legitimate issues that MTCR members may have
with regards to missile proliferation will become harder due to
distraction caused by the drone export debate.]{.underline}

Another option, and one that could be pursued in tandem with an
exemption, would be for current members, or a broader set of nations, to
pursue a [separate export
agreement](http://www.defensenews.com/articles/uncertainty-at-state-holding-up-new-agreement-on-armed-drones)
for drones.

Regardless of what path members choose, [the status quo appears
increasingly unsustainable as advanced and armed drones spread widely;
they could become as widespread as fighter aircraft or tanks within a
generation.]{.underline} Therefore, [while opening a discussion on MTCR
reforms might seem risky, failing to pursue reforms might be even
riskier, because if the regime as a whole is weakened, broader
proliferation of long-range ballistic and cruise missiles would become
more likely.]{.underline}

#### US control of the drone market prevents allies from buying from China and ensures safe prolif

**Seligman 18** (Lara Seligman, *Foreign Policy*'s Pentagon
correspondent. "Trump's Push to Boost Lethal Drone Exports Reaps Few
Rewards," *Foreign Policy Magazine*, December 6, 2018,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/06/trump-push-to-boost-lethal-drone-exports-reaps-few-rewards-uas-mtcr/)///JP

[In another attempt to boost sales, the Trump administration is also
pursuing changes to the Missile Technology Control Regime
(MTCR),]{.underline} a 35-member export control body created in 1987 to
prevent the spread of cruise and ballistic missiles that could carry
weapons of mass destruction. At the time the control regime was set up,
drones had a lot in common with one-way missiles---they were generally
either used as target practice to test missile accuracy or as very
short-range surveillance platforms, explains Michael Horowitz, an
associate professor of political science and the associate director of
Perry World House at the University of Pennsylvania, in the Bulletin of
the Atomic Scientists. So the body was set up to control them, too,
holding drones that can travel more than 300 km (about 180 miles) and
carry a payload of more than 500 kg (about 1,100 pounds) to the same
"strong presumption of denial" for export. The MTCR does not cover
crewed aircraft.

But today, Horowitz argues, [drones are much more akin to crewed
aircraft---a recoverable platform designed to fly out, perform a
particular mission, and return to base]{.underline}---than missiles, and
they should be regulated as such.

["Regulating the export of drones and drone parts using range and
payload standards relevant for missiles represents a mismatch between
technology and reality,]{.underline} which could have negative effects,"
Horowitz writes. "Placing drones in the same exempt category as crewed
aircraft would reflect the technological reality and help preserve the
integrity of the regime."

[Keith Webster, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Defense
and Aerospace Export Council, also disputed the argument that selling
more U.S. drones abroad will lead to the proliferation of WMD.
**Allowing China to control the market is where the true danger
lies**,]{.underline} he said.

["Actually, **the best way to manage the risk of \[drones\] being used
for WMD is for the United States to be the one that exports it to
partners**, because when we export things we partner with the country
that's receiving it to ensure they are using it in a safe
way]{.underline}," Webster argued. "[When the Chinese sell these things,
we have no visibility into how the user is going to use
it."]{.underline}

[Experts are increasingly concerned that traditional U.S. allies are now
turning to China for their drone needs]{.underline}. The [Obama
administration denied requests for armed or advanced unarmed drones from
Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, and Iraq. Subsequently, these
countries, along with Saudi Arabia, bought armed drones from
China.]{.underline}

"[You've got to balance the competing priorities, but in this instance
actually changing our policy to allow more commercial sales serves both
a commercial imperative and a nonproliferation imperative," Webster
said]{.underline}

**US control of the drone industry prevents rogue actors from obtaining
drones**

and investigative journalist. "Trump's new policies could seal US drone
industry's doom -- and make us less safe," *Silicon Angle*, January 14,

But [U.S. monopoly control over drone tech evaporated a long time ago.
[According to defense experts, some 90 nations now possess drone
technology]{.mark}.]{.underline} And a third of those --- including U.S.
rivals such as China, North Korea and Iran --- now also have full-blown
weaponized military drones. Worse, [ter[rorist organizations, rebel
groups and other nonstate enemies have drones now,
too,]{.underline}]{.mark} [raising fears about potential drone-based
terror attacks.]{.underline}

["[Terrorist organizations have an interest in using drones, and we've
seen that overseas already with some frequency]{.mark},"]{.underline}
FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers at a Senate Homeland
Security hearing in September. "And the expectation is it's coming here,
too. Imminently."

Military technologists and various third parties are working hard on
technology to capture and destroy enemy UAVs, he said, but "it's a
challenge." Big drones are findable via radar and GPS detection, but
[it's far more difficult to detect, defend against and destroy small
consumer drones that rogue actors]{.underline} such as the Islamic
State, Hamas and Hezbollah now [freely buy and customize to surveil and
attack their enemies. Such drones, whether solo or in swarms, are small,
fly too low to be detected by radar and rarely rely on detectable GPS
tech.]{.underline}

The Pentagon has launched a \$700 million program to address the menace
of drones from the Islamic State and other terrorist groups. It gathers
U.S. military resources plus those from big defense contractors and
Silicon Valley. But the program is embryonic and still a long way from
reality. As a stopgap, the Pentagon has been sending teams of tech
experts to Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan to train and otherwise help
American troops defend against enemy drones.

["These things are really small and hard to detect, and if they swarm in
groups, they can overload our ability to knock them all
down,"]{.underline} J.D. Johnson, Raytheon Co.'s head of army programs,
said earlier this year. For instance, according to U.S. intelligence
reports, IS has been using DJI's tiny Phantom drone to surveil its
enemies or drop explosives on them (right).

U.S. Central Command has been training Army troops on third-party
jamming technology such as national lab manager Battelle Memorial
Institute's DroneDefender (below). It's a "point-and-shoot rifle
chassis" that can disrupt a UAV's radio control signals or GPS system,
which stops target drones in midflight and forces them to land.

It's a good stopgap, but [[the U.S. is still a long way from having a
foolproof drone terrorism defense plan.]{.underline}]{.mark} "I don't
think (these technologies are) ready right now," former U.S. Army
Special Forces commander Michael Waltz told American journalists earlier
this year. "We don't have the technology --- the detection technology
and the countermeasure technology --- truly in place yet."

[[The threat of drone-based terror attacks is a direct result of
America's lost leadership in the secto]{.mark}r,]{.underline} because it
no longer calls the shots on drone technology. As a result, said
Sekora[, [it has little influence over who gets to buy and sell
it.]{.underline}]{.mark}

increasing anyway, and both states and non-state actors have a growing
ability to use commercial technology to build their own armed

[17 countries already have armed drone capabilities and more than a

The United States has only exported armed drones to one country, the

Intermediate-range cruise and ballistic missiles could represent an

# MTCR Counterplan 

### 1NC

#### The United States Federal Government should propose an MTCR Annex amendment that specifies that Category 1 air vehicles must be capable of speeds above 650 kilometers per hour. 

(**Mehta 18**, Aaron, Deputy Editor and Senior Pentagon Correspondent
for Defense News, covering policy, strategy and acquisition at the
highest levels of the Department of Defense and its international
partners., US to push new rules for drone agreement in November,
DefenseNews)

Last October, [American officials floated]{.underline} a whitepaper to
allies [proposing that any air vehicle that flies under 650 kilometers
per hour would drop to "category-2" and thus be subject to approval on a
case-by-case basis, as opposed to having to follow the more strict
"category-1" policies.]{.underline}

[Most medium-altitude, long-endurance systems like General Atomics' MQ-1
Predator and MQ-9 Reaper fly at slow speeds, with the Reaper clocking in
with a cruise speed of 230 mph, or 370 kph, according to an Air Force
fact sheet. Northrop Grumman's RQ-4 Global Hawk, a high-altitude drone
used for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, flies at a
cruise speed of about 357 mph, or 575 kph.]{.underline}

[American industry]{.underline} and others [have]{.underline} [[raised
the
concern](https://www.defensenews.com/industry/2018/04/23/do-new-trump-arms-export-rules-live-up-to-the-hype/)
that China or other competitors will fill the void for countries to whom
the U.S. won't sell, something Thompson echoed during her interview at
the Defense Writers Group.]{.underline}

["We've seen it with our competitors. If we're not in the region, and if
we're not there with our U.S. equipment, there are other countries that
will fill that gap,"]{.underline} Thompson said.

#### Exempting Drones from the MTCR is key to restoring MTCR credibility

**A threat to the MTCR.** Inaction also creates risks. [The current
approach to grouping drones in the MTCR threatens to undermine the
regime as a whole.]{.underline}

First[, it links two disparate issues, drones on the one hand and cruise
or ballistic missiles on the other, so that exports by MTCR members of
the former could undermine the regime's rules against exporting the
latter]{.underline}. Countries seeking to sell surveillance drones to
allies, for example, could see their exports used by another member to
justify that member's ballistic missile sales.

### Doesn't undermine entire MTCR

#### Carving out Drones does not undermine the MTCR writ large 

(**Dr. Ford 19,** Christopher, Assistant Secretary, Bureau of
International Security and Nonproliferation\
At the Hudson Institute, Arms Control and International Security:
Autonomy, Technology, and National Security: The Case for Reforming the
Missile Technology Control Regime, Department of State,
http://www.defense-aerospace.com/articles-view/verbatim/4/199889/us-states-case-for-extending-mtcr-controls-to-uavs.html)

[We have proposed to carve out a]{.underline} carefully-selected [subset
of Category I UAS for treatment as if they were Category II
systems]{.underline}. [This subset is based upon a maximum speed
value]{.underline} --- [which would]{.underline}, in effect, [update the
MTCR framework to allow more permissive treatment of run-of-the-mill,
basically non-WMD-related modern UAS that are useful, and indeed in
today\'s world all but essential, for a range of non-WMD military and an
exploding universe of peaceful civilian applications.\
\
This change, however, is carefully limited, and would avoid relaxing
MTCR rules on the sorts of WMD-related systems that it has always been
the great virtue of the MTCR to restrict.]{.underline} Things such as
ordinary, slow, fixed-wing UAS --- along with rotary wing systems and
lighter-than-air craft --- would be subject to somewhat more flexible
Category II rules. But [cruise missiles, advanced unmanned combat aerial
vehicles, and hypersonic aerial vehicles would still be covered as
Category I items,]{.underline} as they should be.

### Doesn't link to Fill in:

#### MTCR regulations are what prevents U.S. competitiveness on the international scale 

(**Dr. Ford 19,** Christopher, Assistant Secretary, Bureau of
International Security and Nonproliferation\
At the Hudson Institute, Arms Control and International Security:
Autonomy, Technology, and National Security: The Case for Reforming the
Missile Technology Control Regime, Department of State,
http://www.defense-aerospace.com/articles-view/verbatim/4/199889/us-states-case-for-extending-mtcr-controls-to-uavs.html)

But [other suppliers --- and in particular those outside the MTCR
framework, who are not bound by its strictures and who may feel no
special obligation to scrutinize proposed transfers from a rigorous
nonproliferation perspective as we do --- are not shut out in this way.
Indeed, for them the MTCR is a tool of competitive advantage against
MTCR Partners.]{.underline} Against all of us. [Such other suppliers are
increasingly stepping in where MTCR Partners find it difficult to tread
because even non-WMD-relevant UAS systems are covered by strict Category
I rules with their associated presumption of denial]{.underline}. Under
the right circumstances and with appropriate nonproliferation
assurances, of course, it is not impossible to overcome a presumption of
denial, but having to overcome such hurdles for the modest subset of
Category I UAS that are in reality not a WMD-related threat represents a
considerable impediment --- and, we think, an unnecessary one.\
\
[This situation harms not just the competitiveness of MTCR Partners, but
also the MTCR itself --- and the cause of nonproliferation. It puts
needless pressure upon the MTCR and could threaten its long-term
integrity]{.underline}, for institutions that do not know how to be
appropriately flexible in a changing world risk shattering. Nor does
continuing this rigidity stop the spread of UAS, because non-MTCR
supplies are stepping into this market.\
\
[Indeed, the system\'s current rigidity fails to provide real
nonproliferation benefits either, because the growing sources of foreign
supply for increasingly capable UAS mean that these systems are
spreading anyway. And because non-MTCR suppliers of such equipment
seldom feel the need to approach their transfer-related decision-making
with the nonproliferation-focused scrupulousness that we and other MTCR
Partners display,]{.underline} even for non-Category-I systems, allowing
such non-MCTR suppliers to occupy this competitive terrain essentially
uncontested means that nonproliferation equities will get less and less
respect over time --- unless, that is, we do something to fix this
problem.\
\
In reaction to all this, the United States has proposed a way out of the
trap caused by the MTCR\'s rigidity in the face of UAS-related
technological change.
