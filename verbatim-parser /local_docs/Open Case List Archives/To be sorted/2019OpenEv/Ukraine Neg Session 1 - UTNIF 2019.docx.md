### No Link -- Arm Sales

#### While Russia will backlash over arms sales, they will not start a war

**Bodner 17** (Matthew Bodner, 12-19-2017, \"US arming Ukraine? A look
at how Moscow might respond,\" Defense News,
https://www.defensenews.com/smr/european-balance-of-power/2017/08/02/us-arming-ukraine-a-look-at-how-moscow-might-respond/)

[The conflict in eastern Ukraine, where Moscow is accused of backing
separatists in the Donbas region bordering Russia, has been frozen for
the better part of two years.]{.underline} Neither side has managed to
achieve decisive victories, and a 2015 cease-fire protocol known as
Minsk II has failed to achieve any lasting results. The conflict in
Donetsk and Luhansk festers on. [Russian defense analyst Vasily Kashin
told Defense News that U.S. weapons --- particularly Javelins --- will
do little to change the course of the conflict. The primary weapons
being used in Donbas]{.underline}, he said, [are not tanks and anti-tank
missiles, but old artillery systems.]{.underline} Ultimately, all the
proposal would accomplish is signaling to Moscow that Washington is
upping the ante in Ukraine, Kashin asserted. "There must be an
understanding that there will be costs," Kashin said, "and these will
not be limited to the Ukrainian theater. There are a wide range of
weapons systems we \[Russia\] can sell to Iran without violating U.N.
sanctions, for example. And any improvement in Ukrainian military
capabilities will be met with much greater development of \[separatist\]
capabilities." Andrei Frolov, an analyst at the Moscow-based Center for
the Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, agrees that [the Kremlin
will respond with heavier weapon deliveries to the Donbas rebel forces.
"In my mind, the Javelin is more a defensive weapon than anything else.
I don't think this would be very dangerous, but it would be]{.underline}
quite [provocative]{.underline}," Frolov said. Moscow will wait for
Washington to finalize its proposal --- assuming it even reaches Trump's
desk --- before exploring formal responses. The two sides have more
immediate controversies plaguing their relations at the moment. The
Kremlin is now awaiting Washington's response to strict limitations
imposed on U.S. Embassy Moscow staffers Friday. "[If the proposal does
go through]{.underline}," said Russian foreign affairs analyst Vladimir
Frolov, "[we \[Russia\] will cry foul and raise propaganda hell, but we
will not move a single tank.]{.underline} Arming Kiev will not affect
Russia's negotiating position in the Minsk process, but it will likely
freeze this conflict for good."

#### US arms sales to Ukraine would not have an impact

**Sisk 17** (Richard Sisk, 12-29-2017, \"Mattis to Russia on US Arming
Ukraine: Get Over It,\" Military,
https://www.military.com/daily-news/2017/12/29/mattis-russia-us-arming-ukraine-get-over-it.html)

[Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Friday that the U.S. decision to
[supply \"defensive\" weapons to
Ukraine](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2017/12/23/us-officials-say-lethal-weapons-headed-ukraine.html),
possibly including
[Javelin](http://www.military.com/equipment/fgm-148-javelin) anti-tank
missiles, should be no cause of alarm for the Russians.]{.underline}
\"Hopefully, [it won\'t have an impact\" on the tense relations between
Ukraine and Moscow over Russia\'s support for separatists in eastern
Ukraine, Mattis said. \"They\'re defensive weapons,\"]{.underline}
Mattis said of the arms for Ukraine that reportedly include Javelins and
anti-aircraft weapons. In an informal year-end session with Pentagon
reporters, [Mattis also said there were no intentions to increase the
small U.S. troop presence in Ukraine, where U.S. troops have been
training Ukraine forces well away from the frontlines in eastern
Ukraine.]{.underline} \"As you know, we have some trainers there \--
training to NATO standards,\" Mattis said. \"There\'s not plan to change
that number at all \-- as long as no one wants to invade Ukraine. I
don\'t see any evolving U.S. military role in Ukraine right now.\" The
provision of [defensive weapons to Ukraine has long been backed by the
Defense Department,]{.underline} but the Obama administration withheld
approval and the Trump administration also initially was reluctant to
sanction a deal that could antagonize Russia.

### No US-Russia War

#### No US-Russia war -- low probability of success and low profit disincentivizes russia

**Harari 17** (Yuval Noah Harari, Israeli historian and a professor in
the Department of History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem., June
23, 2017, 6-23-2017, \"Why It's No Longer Possible for Any Country to
Win a War,\" Time,
https://time.com/4826856/russia-trump-north-korea-china-war/#ob-player)

[The only recent successful war waged by a major power has been the
Russian conquest of the
[Crimea](https://time.com/4672142/russia-books/item/beyond-crimea-the-new-russian-empire/).
However, it was made possible by an extraordinary set of
circumstances]{.underline}: The Ukrainian army showed no resistance;
other powers refrained from intervening; and the Crimean population
either supported the invaders or peacefully accepted the conquest as a
fait accompli. [These circumstances will be hard to
reproduce.]{.underline} If the precondition for a successful war is the
absence of any enemies willing to resist, it limits the available
opportunities. [Indeed, when Russia sought to reproduce its Crimean
success in other parts of the Ukraine, it encountered substantially
stiffer opposition]{.underline}, and the war in eastern
[Ukraine](https://time.com/4710602/kiev-kremlin-narrowing-options-ukraine/)
bogged down into an unproductive stalemate. Conquering decrepit
Soviet-era factories in Luhansk and Donetsk hardly pays for the war, and
it certainly does not offset the costs of international sanctions. The
conquest of
[Crimea](https://time.com/3749811/crimea-russia-annexation-anniversary/)
notwithstanding, it seems that in the twenty-first century the most
successful strategy is to keep your peace and let others do the fighting
for you. Why has it become so difficult for major powers to wage
successful wars? [One reason is the change in the nature of the economy.
In the past, if you defeated your enemy on the battlefield, you could
easily cash in by looting enemy cities, selling enemy civilians in the
slave markets and occupying valuable wheat fields and gold mines. Yet in
the twenty-first century, only puny profits could be made that
way.]{.underline} Today, the main economic assets consist of technical
and institutional knowledge --- and you cannot conquer knowledge through
war. An organization such as ISIS may flourish by looting cities and oil
wells in the Middle East --- in 2014,
[ISIS](http://www.businessinsider.com/isis-making-50-million-a-month-from-oil-sales-2015-10)
seized more than \$500 million from Iraqi banks and in 2015 made an
additional \$500 million from selling oil. But
[China](https://time.com/4827923/james-mattis-china-north-korea/) and
the U.S. are unlikely to start a war for a paltry billion. As for
spending trillions of dollars on a war against the U.S., how could China
repay these expenses and balance all the war damages and lost trade
opportunities? Would the victorious People's Liberation Army loot the
riches of Silicon Valley? True, corporations such as Apple, Facebook and
Google are worth hundreds of billions of dollars, but you cannot seize
these fortunes by force. There are no silicon mines in Silicon Valley.
[A successful war could theoretically still bring huge profits by
enabling the victor to rearrange the global trade system in its favor,
as the U.S. did after its victory over Hitler. However, present-day
military technology would make it extremely difficult to repeat this
feat.]{.underline} By definition, profits large enough to make a global
war worthwhile for the victor will also make it worthwhile for the loser
to resort to weapons of mass destruction. The atom bomb has turned
"victory" in a World War into collective suicide. It is no coincidence
that since Hiroshima superpowers never fought one another directly, and
engaged only in what (for them) were low-stake conflicts in which none
was tempted to use nuclear weapons to avert defeat. Indeed, even
attacking a second-rate nuclear power such as Iran or North Korea is an
extremely unattractive proposition. [Cyber
warfare](https://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-2016-hackers-runner-up/)
makes things even worse for would-be imperialists. As recently as the
days of [George W.
Bush](https://time.com/4738495/george-w-bush-foreign-aid/), the U.S.
could wreak havoc in far-off Fallujah while the Iraqis had no means of
retaliating against San Francisco. But if the U.S. now attacks a country
possessing even moderate cyber warfare capabilities, malware and logic
bombs could stop air traffic in Dallas, cause trains to collide in
Philadelphia and bring down the electric grid in Michigan. [In the great
age of conquerors, warfare was a low-damage, high-profit
affair.]{.underline} At the battle of Hastings in 1066, William the
Conqueror gained the whole of England in a single day for the cost of a
few thousand dead. [Nuclear weapons and cyber warfare, by contrast, are
high-damage, low-profit technologies]{.underline}. You could use such
tools to destroy entire countries, but not to build profitable empires.
Hence in a world filling up with saber-rattling and bad vibes, perhaps
[our best guarantee of peace is that major powers aren't familiar with
any recent example of a successful war.]{.underline} While Genghis Khan
or Julius Caesar would invade a foreign country at the drop of a hat,
[present-day strongmen talk loud but are very careful about actually
launching wars]{.underline}.

#### Russia would not initiate an attack on the US and US-Russia relations now will prevent a war

in response to an incoming]{.underline} missile [attack]{.underline}.
[He voiced confidence that Russia could resist Western pressure and
expressed hope that U.S. President Donald Trump eventually would move to
repair fractured ties with Russia.]{.underline} Speaking at an
international policy forum in Sochi, Putin noted that [Russia's military
doctrine](https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2017/09/13/if-russia-started-world-war-iii-heres-how-it-would-go-down/)
doesn't envisage a preventative nuclear strike. [He said Moscow only
would tap its nuclear arsenal if early warning systems spotted missiles
heading toward Russia. \"Only when we become convinced that there is an
incoming attack on the territory of Russia, and that happens within
seconds, only after that we would launch a retaliatory strike,\" he said
during a panel discussion at the forum.]{.underline} \"It would
naturally mean a global catastrophe, but I want to emphasize that we
can\'t be those who initiate it because we don\'t foresee a preventive
strike,\" Putin said. \"The aggressor should know that retaliation is
inevitable, and he will be destroyed.\" \"We would be victims of an
aggression and would get to heaven as martyrs,\" while those who
initiated the aggression would \"just die and not even have time to
repent,\" he added. The Russian leader also warned that new hypersonic
missiles his country developed give it a [military
edge](http://www.defensenews.com/digital-show-dailies/ausa/2018/10/16/updated-army-missile-defense-strategy-in-works-to-address-peer-threats/).
\"We have run ahead of the competition. No one has precision hypersonic
weapons,\" he said. \"Others are planning to start testing them within
the next 1½ to 2 years, and we already have them on duty.\" Russia
already has deployed the Kinzhal hypersonic missile. Putin said that
another new weapon, the Avangard, is set to enter service in the next
few months. Earlier this year, Putin said the Avangard has an
intercontinental range and can fly in the atmosphere at a speed 20 times
the speed of sound, making it capable of piercing any missile defense
system. His blunt talk Thursday comes as Russia-West relations remain
frosty over the Ukrainian crisis, the war in Syria and the allegations
of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential vote. [Putin said he
still hoped Trump would be able to improve the ties between their
countries. He thinks Trump wants \"some sort of stabilization and
improvement of U.S.-Russian ties\" and said Moscow is ready for that
\"at any moment.\" Putin said his]{.underline} [[meeting with Trump in

### Nuclear War No Impact -- No Nuclear Winter

#### Nuclear winter empirically disproven

**Walker 2018** (Robert Walker, first class honours degree in Maths from
York university ,PhD at Wolfson College Oxford, lol not the Trump space

Fallou\...,\" No Publication,

[There are many online pages and websites that seem very authoritative
that say that even a limited nuclear war, say between India and
Pakistan, would plunge the Earth into a 'Nuclear winter']{.underline}
with no crops able to grow, no plants, no animals, and people soon
starving to extinction. [This is politically motivated and based on out
of date or junk science.]{.underline} I am very much in favour of
nuclear disarmament so I'm strongly in favour of the political views
that motivate these people. I go so far as to argue that the UK should
disarm unilaterally, and should never use its nuclear weapons under any
circumstances. This is a similar view to the Scottish National Party and
Jeremy Corbyn though he has not persuaded his party to adopt this
stance, see my [Is Corbyn Right About The Bomb?- Op
Ed](http://www.science20.com/robert_inventor/is_corbyn_right_about_the_bomb_op_ed-180465).
But I think people need to know the truth and make decisions based on
truth. I think it is important to speak up when a view is widely
publicized that just about all scientists believe to be false, based on
poorly supported research that they think will lead politicians to
desired actions. Even if it has good political effects. In this case as
well, [it is]{.underline} also [scaring people unnecessarily who are
afraid that even a small nuclear war could plunge us all into a deep
freeze. No, it would not, and the research suggesting this is
fundamentally flawed and based on out of date ideas. The expert
scientists involved are sure that the older nuclear winter models were
incorrect, based on their failed predictions for the Kuwaiti oil fires
which they predicted would harm agriculture over much of Asia but it
only had local short term effects]{.underline}. There were many who were
skeptical all along, but that was what persuaded nearly all of the ones
who still thought it was possible that their models were wrong. There is
one notable remaining nuclear winter proponent, Robok, who along with
various co-authors publishes articles that are widely publicized because
of their dramatic conclusions. However these predictions are not only
not well received by other climate researchers, they are generally
regarded as incorrect due to fundamental flaws in the assumptions his
models are based on. The researchers who say this make assumptions that
they can\'t prove and that everyone else in the field has said long ago
don\'t work. [Carl Sagan gave up on the nuclear winter hypothesis after
the Kuwaiti oil field fires and just about everyone else]{.underline}
except Robok [agreed with him.]{.underline} SUMMARY The nuclear winter
predictions date back to some predictions in the 1970s based on their
limited crude models on slow computers (by modern standards) with hardly
any memory, just kilobytes. They tried to model what would happen to the
soot from fires in cities during a nuclear war. They concluded that it
would be lofted so high into the atmosphere that it would get above all
the normal weather and linger there for a decade, nearly blocking out
the sun completely world wide. Their predictions were so dramatic that a
\'nuclear winter\' is an understatement. Average world temperature -25
C. You are talking about the ocean freezing even right to the tropics,
for ten years. It\'s no wonder that they gave it that name. It had the
support by highly respected scientist. One of the authors of the
original paper was Carl Sagan. But the [models were based on flawed
assumptions. Even at the time they were questioned. Nowadays just about
all scientists involved, including ones that supported the hypothesis
originally, are agreed that it would have little effect. It might no
effect on temperature at all, except for a brief reduction of
temperature locally during the fire itself as it turns day to night
temporarily - since after all we have large areas burnt in wildfires
every year with no effect.]{.underline} The [scientists who did the
nuclear winter work realized they had made a mistake in the modeling
after the Kuwaiti oil fires. When the oil fields were left burning by
the retreating troops, they predicted dire consequences for agriculture
througout Asia. Instead it shaded out a small part of the gulf area with
a slight reduction of temperature (similar to night time) for the
duration of the fires]{.underline} (several months). This showed that
there was something wrong with their models. After looking into it in
more detail [they decided that the soot doesn\'t rise nearly as high as
they predicted in the atmosphere, and it tends to get washed out within
days by rain.]{.underline} The combined effect is that the darkening is
temporary and local instead of long term and global. So, nearly all
scientists agreed on this, but [Alan Robock published a paper in Physics
Today in which he claimed that an all out exchange between Pakistan and
India, of, say, 100 nuclear weapons would cool the Earth on average by a
few degrees. The science in this paper was good except that he started
it already pre-loaded with soot in the upper atmosphere]{.underline}.
Remember the very reason the early models got discredited is because
soot doesn't rise as high as expected in the Kuwaiti oil fires. Nor does
it with wildfires or the fires from the Dreden bombing - and Hiroshima
and Nagasaki didn't have fire storms at all. This paper doesn't even
discuss this question. [It simply pre-loads the atmosphere with soot in
the upper atmosphere, and from then on it follows the consequences. But
that is the very point at contention - whether the soot would end up so
high in the atmosphere. Everyone is agreed that there would be serious
consequences if this happened but the evidence is that it can't get
there after the fires started in a nuclear war.]{.underline}

#### No nuke winter

The only recent paper researching into the soot rising into the
atmosphere is in agreement that [significant cooling after a limited
nuclear exchange is unlikely]{.underline}: [Climate Impact of a Regional
Nuclear Weapons Exchange: An Improved Assessment Based On Detailed
Source
Calculations](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017JD027331):
[\"Due to the heat of the fire and of the BC particles that are
produced, some of the particles are lofted into the stratosphere.
However, our comprehensive urban fire simulations indicate that the bulk
of the carbon mass remains in the troposphere, where it is quickly
removed from the atmosphere]{.underline}. In most previous work, for
example, that of Stenke et al. (2013) and Mills et al. (2014), all of
the soot produced by the urban fires is directly injected near the top
of the troposphere, and therefore much of it rises into the
stratosphere, where it shades and cools the Earth. In contrast, if we
use a realistic vertical profile for the BC aerosols as input to the
climate model, the long‐term global impacts on climate are much less
severe than predicted by previous studies. This was true even with
conservative, worst case assumptions regarding BC production. \...\"
"[Our analysis demonstrates that the probability of significant global
cooling from a limited exchange scenario as envisioned in previous
studies is highly unlikely, a conclusion supported by examination of
natural analogs, such as large forest fires and volcanic
eruptions]{.underline}." [Climate Impact of a Regional Nuclear Weapons

The soot from a nuclear bomb is just soot from ordinary fires similar to
that from e.g. the Dresden firestorm or the other carpet bombings of
Japanese cities in the war before Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Some dust and
smoke does go up during the initial mushroom cloud but the fires which
were the basis of the nuclear winter hypothesis haven\'t started yet at
that point. They calculate in that paper that less than a hundredth of
the total material that gets into the upper atmosphere above 5 km comes
from this stage of the explosion. Lundquist and Robock are researching
into this stage of the process but haven't published their research yet.
[Nuclear winter is still a hot topic as a new arms race heats
up](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/8/18212021/nuclear-war-winter-climate-changes-russia-north-korea-tactical-nuke-inf-treaty)
Lundquist's summary of her reason for researching into this is "I think
it's important to let policy makers know that there could be very big
consequences to political choices," she says. "So even if it's not very
likely, it could be devastating." So they also admit the possibility
that it might not be very likely. NO NUCLEAR WINTER This was the big bug
bear during the cold war. Carl Sagan and others calculated that an all
out nuclear war, both the explosions themselves and the firestorms they
created, would put so much dust into the upper atmosphere that it would
cool the entire Earth for several years afterwards in a nuclear winter.
The idea of a [nuclear winter]{.underline} goes back to a 1983
[paper](http://www.bioinfo.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de/fileadmin/07030400/Science-1990-Turco-166-76_1_globalNuclear.pdf)
predicting an average world temperature of -25 C following a global
nuclear war. This is for an all out exchange of the nuclear weapons of
US and Russia during the cold war. This [is based on work with early
primitive 1D models and very low resolution 3D models and based on many
assumptions about how smoke from the fires would move in the
atmosphere]{.underline}. These models had a lot of influence on thinking
about the cold war and were widely respected and believed at the time,
by the likes of Carl Sagan etc. Carl Sagan is a co-author. Here is an
early interview with him warning about the potentially serious effects
and saying that scientists had come together and were in general
agreement about it. However later their [models were proved to be wrong
with the Kuwaiti oil fires which did not behave as they predicted. Even
at the time there was a fair bit of skepticism with some scientists
writing that they thought that the ones who proposed a nuclear winter
were politically motivated. Not that they were deceiptful of course,
just that perhaps they were more easily persuaded by not such strong
evidence due to their political persuasions about nuclear
war.]{.underline} For instance there is a very skeptical paper from
1986, published in Nature, just 3 years after the Sagan paper: Emanuel,
K. A. [\"Nuclear winter: Towards a scientific
exercise.\"](http://ftp/texmex.mit.edu/pub/emanuel/PAPERS/nuclear.pdf)
Nature 319.6051 (1986): 259-259. He says that following a model by
Golding the soot would rise at 20 cm / second which is enough so that
even in dry air, water would condense out and wash the soot out of the
atmosphere before it got high enough to become a continent wide pall in
the upper atmosphere (the moisture would condense out similarly to the
way cummulus clouds form above rising air on a sunny day). [Seitz was
another early skeptic, writing in the same year
(1986)](http://www.textfiles.com/survival/nkwrmelt.txt): "As the science
progressed and more authentic sophistication was achieved in newer and
more elegant models, the postulated effects headed downhill. By 1986,
these worst-case effects had melted down from a year of arctic darkness
to warmer temperatures than the cool months in [Palm
Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida)! A new
[paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm) of broken clouds and
cool spots had emerged. The once global hard
[frost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frost) had retreated back to the
northern [tundra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra). Mr. Sagan\'s
elaborate conjecture had fallen prey to
[Murphy\'s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_Law) lesser-known
Second Law: If everything MUST go wrong, don\'t bet on it." Those views
were not widely accepted at the time. But eventually just about
everyone, including Carl Sagan, came to change their views on nuclear
winter, within six years of him writing that. So what happened? Well -
their calculations turned out to be accurate for asteroid impacts. This
is a significant issue though not an extinction causing one, for large
asteroid impacts. They are also accurate for supervolcanoes which lift
large amounts of ash into the upper atmosphere, not enough to cause a
nuclear winter but enough for a supervolcano autumn. Their models are
still accepted for both those scenarios. But several things happened to
cast doubt on their calculations for nuclear weapons. First it's
important to realize, their models are not based on the idea of the
immediate effects of the nuclear weapons. The explosion itself doesn't
loft anything like enough material to be of concern. That makes it
different from an asteroid impact or volcanic eruption. Their model was
instead based on the idea that the nuclear weapons would cause large
scale fire storms in urban areas. They predicted that this soot, from
ordinary fires, but very large ones, would be lofted up into the upper
atmosphere. This is what they later came to realize was based on flawed
reasoning and over simple models. In particular, when the Iraqis
retreated after their invasion of Kuwait, then they set many oil wells
alight. These created dense black smoke that turned day to night over
large areas As reported for instance in the [Baltimore
times:](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-01-23/news/1991023131_1_kuwait-saddam-hussein-sagan)
Cornell University astronomer Carl Sagan says Saddam Hussein\'s orders
to torch Kuwaiti oil wells, if carried far enough, could unleash smoke
clouds that would disrupt agriculture across South Asia and darken skies
around the world. \"You need a very small lowering of the average
temperatures of the Northern Hemisphere to have serious consequences for
agriculture,\" Sagan said. Scientists in Maryland and Colorado say such
a disaster would require fires at hundreds of wells burning for months,
but they agreed the potential exists in Kuwait for a \"very
catastrophic\" environmental event. Saddam Hussein of course did set the
oil wells alight - and hundreds of them too. At the time then there were
worries they would burn for five years. And there were 610 fires (others
say 750) burnt uncontrolled from [February through to May
1991](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwaiti_oil_fires) at which point
the thousands of fire fighters had their equipment in place and began to
put them out. Here is how they did it: Longer video
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1vonQiadkM) To begin with there
were a lot of days when it was totally dark. And when you could see the
sky it didn't last for more than a few minutes and it was total darknes
again. It was exactly the sort of scenario they had predicted for a
nuclear winter, and they'd have expected at least major cooling effects
and immense disruption of agriculture over most of Asia. But it didn't
have the widespread effects the scientists had expected. As [Carl
Sagan](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/c/Carl_Sagan.htm)wrote
in his Demon Haunted World, page 257: \"it was pitch black at noon and
temperatures dropped 4--6 °C over the Persian Gulf, but not much smoke
reached stratospheric altitudes and Asia was spared." For more about
this background see the section in Wikidia's [Carl Sagan - Scientific
and critical thinking
advocacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan#Scientific_and_critical_thinking_advocacy)
This lead to them re-evaluating the models that lead to the nuclear
winter prediction, which were rather crude, making many assumptions and
approximations. They couldn't be right to have got the predictions about
the Kuwaiti oil fires so very wrong. [The conclusion nowadays is that
nuclear weapons most likely would not cause firestorms in cities, if
they did, the smoke would rarely reach higher than 4 km. Also much more
of Earth burns in wild fires every year without putting us into a
nuclear winter scenario. Also modern nuclear bombs are smaller than they
used to be. Both US and Russia have eliminated all bombs of more than
one megaton. Only China has them now, with about 50 of them. To get the
dust high enough for nuclear winter, above 70,000 feet you'd need bombs
with yields much more than a megaton. Modern bombs would only throw the
debris up to 60,000 to 70,000 feet which means the debris will rain to
Earth within hours or days close to the point of impact.]{.underline}
Our nuclear arsenals are also much smaller than they were at the time of
the nuclear winter calculations. So [in short, nuclear winter was based
on poor science, as it turned out (refuted by the Kuwaiti fires), and
probably even at the height of the cold war, we would not have been
plunged into a nuclear winter. As it is now, certainly not.]{.underline}
NUCLEAR WINTER, NUCLEAR AUTUMN, OR NO GLOBAL CLIMATE EFFECTS? So in
short, [nowadays most scientists who have researched into this say that
even at the height of the cold war, we would not have been plunged into
a nuclear winter]{.underline}.

[The global economy is a vast machine, operating beyond the control of
even the most powerful individuals, and it has a will of its own to
consume and pollute]{.underline}. It's hard to believe that this massive
metal beast will be peacefully undone by the people who survive by it,
and we all survive by it in some way, often against our wills; it bribes
and entraps us all in ways large and small. But a wrench could clog the
gears, and maybe only a wrench can stop it. [One wrench that could slow
climate disruption may be a large-scale conflict that halts the global
economy, destroys fossil fuel infrastructure, and throws particulates in
the air.]{.underline} At this point, with insane people like Trump,
Putin, Xi, May, and Macron leading the world's biggest nuclear powers,
large-scale conflagration between them would probably lead to a nuclear
exchange. Nobody wants nuclear war. Rather, nobody sane and prosocial
wants nuclear war. It is an absolute horror that would burn and maim
millions of living beings, despoil millions of hectares, and scar the
skin of the earth and dome of the sky for centuries, maybe millennia.
With proxy conflict brewing between the US and Russia in the Middle East
and the [Thucydides
trap](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/06/09/the-thucydides-trap/) ready to
ensnare us with an ascendant China, nuclear war looks like a more
realistic possibility than it has since the 1980s. [A devastating fact
of climate collapse is that there may be a silver lining to the mushroom
cloud. First, it should be noted that a nuclear exchange does not
inevitably result in apocalyptic loss of life. Nuclear
winter]{.underline}---the idea that firestorms would make the earth
uninhabitable---[is based on shaky science. There's no reliable model
that can determine how many megatons would decimate agriculture or make
humans extinct.]{.underline} [Nations have already detonated 2,476
nuclear devices. An exchange that shuts down the global economy but
stops short of human extinction may be the only blade realistically
likely to cut the carbon knot we're trapped within. It would decimate
existing infrastructures, providing an opportunity to build new energy
infrastructure and intervene in the current investments and subsidies
keeping fossil fuels alive.]{.underline} In the near term, emissions
would almost certainly rise as militaries are some of the world's
[largest
emitters](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/01/climate/us-biggest-carbon-polluter-in-history-will-it-walk-away-from-the-paris-climate-deal.html).
Given what we know of human history, though, c[onflict may be the only
way to build the mass social cohesion necessary for undertaking the kind
of huge, collective action needed for global sequestration and energy
transition.]{.underline} Like the 20th century's world wars, [a nuclear
exchange could serve as an economic leveler. It could provide
justification for nationalizing energy industries with the interest of
shuttering fossil fuel plants and transitioning to renewables
and]{.underline}, uh, [nuclear energy. It could shock us into
reimagining a less suicidal civilization, one that dethrones the
death-cult zealots who are currently in power. And it may toss
particulates into the atmosphere sufficient to block out some of the
solar heat helping to drive global warming.]{.underline} Or it may have
the opposite effects. Who knows? What we do know is that [humans can
survive and recover from war, probably even a nuclear one. Humans cannot
recover from runaway climate change]{.underline}. Nuclear war is not an
inevitable extinction event; six degrees of warming is. Given that
mostly violent, psychopathic individuals manage the governments and
industries of the world, it may only be possible for anti-social
collective action---that is, war---to halt, or at least slow, our
inexorable march toward oblivion. A courageous, benevolent ruler might
compel vast numbers of people to collective action. But we have too few
of those, and the legal, political, and military barriers preventing
them from rising are immense. Our current crop of villainous presidents,
prime ministers, and CEOs, whether lusting for chaos or pursuing their
own petty ends, may inadvertently conspire to break the machine now
preventing our future. When so bereft of heroes, [we may need to rely on
humanity's antagonists and their petty incompetence to accidentally save
the day.]{.underline} It is a stark reflection of how homicidal our
economy is---and our collective adherence to its whims---that [nuclear
war could be a rational course of action.]{.underline}

## Solvency

### No Solvency -- Nuclear War Inevitable

#### Nuclear war is inevitable

**Crisp 18** (John, "The Inevitable Nuclear War"
<https://www.timesrecordnews.com/story/opinion/2018/02/12/inevitable-nuclear-war/329201002/>)
NIJ

**[We don't do enough thinking about catastrophe]{.underline}**, so
let's pause to note that **[everything]{.underline}** on our national
political stage --- tax reform, immigration, health care, the Mueller
investigation --- and in our private lives, for that matter, **[occurs
against two apocalyptic backdrops: climate change and nuclear
war.]{.underline}** That's too much to think about in 700 words, so
let's allow climate change to simmer on the back burner for a while.
[Despite already catastrophic effects, we're doing very little about
it]{.underline}, anyway; on the contrary, we've elected national
leadership that doesn't take it seriously. So [let's consider instead
the possibility of nuclear war]{.underline}: The 1962 Cuban Missile
Crisis got our attention, and for a decade or two we lived with the
reality that nuclear destruction was as few as 30 minutes away. We built
fallout shelters, studied ways to protect ourselves from radiation and
held civil defense drills. Then we got used to the idea and settled into
a grim nuclear standoff with other nuclear nations; the notion of
nuclear annihilation became as abstract and distant --- and as easily
ignorable --- as climate change. We even made successful efforts at
limiting nuclear proliferation and at reducing standing nuclear
arsenals. But [with Iran, North Korea and a U.S. president more inclined
toward belligerence than diplomacy, things have changed: nuclear is
back. Current conditions are reminiscent of the world of 1913, just
prior to the start of the First World War: The Great War didn't have a
proximate cause, and historians still puzzle over why it happened at
all.]{.underline} How could such a cataclysmic world-wide event be
triggered by an isolated assassination in Sarajevo in 1914? [The answer
resides in the tensions and rivalries among the great international
powers of the day and in their response to them, which was to prepare
for war.]{.underline} For example, in 1900 Germany decided to build a
fleet to match Britain's Royal Navy, and by 1906 a full-fledged race for
battleship superiority was underway. Similarly, France extended the
terms of service of its conscripts in order to match the size of
Germany's growing army. In short, by 1913 armies and weapons had taken
on a life of their own that threatened the power of national leaders and
diplomats to control them. Because the European powers were so well
prepared for war, war had become almost inevitable. The assassination of
Archduke Ferdinand was merely the incidental trigger that ignited the
conflagration. Further, in 1913 war was a matter of horses and swords
and single-shot, bolt-action rifles. Certainly, soldiers got hurt and
many died, but Europe didn't have the collective imagination to envision
the devastation of a modern war fought with modern weapons. Few could
have predicted 40 million casualties in just four years. [We suffer from
both of these conditions today: We've never really absorbed the stark
lessons of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and we've failed to extrapolate the
devastation of the two comparatively modest nuclear weapons discharged
in 1945 to a significant exchange of today's much more powerful weapons.
**Because the aftermath of a real nuclear war is unthinkable, we've
largely refused to think about it.**]{.underline} Further, **[the
weapons themselves threaten our capacity to control them.]{.underline}**
Nuclear weapons are precarious, as indicated by the recent panic in
Honolulu when a defense drill got out of hand. [And while we might hope
that the use of nuclear weapons could be constrained by rationality,
somehow in our country we've allowed the so-called nuclear football to
fall into the hands of a man who is characterized by emotion,
insecurity, impulse and bluster. And then there's Kim
Jong-un.]{.underline} One other factor works against us, just as it did
in 1913: Next year's Pentagon budget will be \$716 billion, the largest
ever. **[Weapons demand to be used. We've never invented a weapon that
we've declined to use. All of this implies that a nuclear war is
inevitable, and the ensuing calamity will be
unimaginable.]{.underline}** The only silver lining is that the
devastation of climate change will fade into insignificance.

#### Risk of nuclear war is incredibly high regardless of the affirmative.

the Odds?" *The Nonproliferation Review* 20, no. 2, p. 371-373) NIJ

Uncertainty Analysis Classical statistical analysis often provides
confidence intervals around estimated parameters. [Bayesian analysis
constructs credible intervals]{.underline}, using somewhat different
procedures and the interpretation is also different. For four different
probability parameters, this viewpoint started with a prior
distribution, utilized the available evidence, and derived a posterior
distribution. [I show below the means, the medians, and the 95 percent
credible intervals of these posterior distributions. The incurred risk
of nuclear war from significant military provocation during crises had a
mean of 14.3 percent]{.underline}, a median of 8.7 percent, and a 95
percent credible interval of 0.018 to 53.7 percent. [The expected risk
of nuclear war from significant military provocation during crises had a
mean of 13.4 percent]{.underline}, a median of 8.5 percent, and a
95-percent credible interval of 0.018 to 47.5 percent. [The incurred
mishap risk of nuclear war during forty-four years of Cold War had a
mean of 34.9 percent]{.underline}, a median of 32.5 percent, and a 95
percent credible interval of 3.5 to 78.3 percent. [The expected mishap
risk of nuclear war during forty-four years of Cold War had a mean of
44.1 percent]{.underline}, a median of 42.8 percent, and a 95-percent
credible interval of 5.0 to 88.7 percent. [The expected risk of a
general conventional war resulting in nuclear war during sixty-six years
of the nuclear age had a mean of 19.4 percent]{.underline}, a median of
13.1 percent, and a 95 percent credible interval of 0.035 to 66.6
percent. The estimated deterrent effect of nuclear weapons in preventing
general conventional wars has a mean of 64.8 percent, a median of 76.1
percent, and a 95 percent credible interval of 0.50 to 99.94 percent.
The above 95 percent credible intervals provide a fairly wide range of
possible probabilities. These wide ranges tell us that it may be
possible for further evidence or sound reasoning to alter the
conclusions. These ranges are not, however, a license to choose whatever
beliefs one wishes on these matters. For example, if the temperature
tomorrow is predicted to be 70F, with a 95 percent credible interval of
60F to 80F, we are not free to assume that the temperature will be
either 608F or 80F, depending on which temperature we like better.
Similarly, [unless additional evidence can be found to demonstrate a
different set of probabilities, the mean probability]{.underline} (not
the median or a range) [is the best probability estimate for the
evidence and models in this viewpoint.]{.underline} Another way to
analyze uncertainty about the probability estimates is to test the
sensitivity of the model to changes in assumptions. Various assumptions,
described in this viewpoint, were utilized to obtain the probability
estimates. If the assumptions and calculations are correct, the results
are correct. Suppose one or more assumptions might be incorrect\*how
would the model results change? The incurred risk of nuclear war was
44.3 percent from two pathways (crises and mishaps). Estimates from
these two pathways depend on seven basic factors that were applied to
the model. I varied each factor to be half or double their baseline
values. I then classified the results of these alternatives as
''optimistic'' or ''pessimistic,'' depending on whether they reduced or
increased the estimated probability of nuclear war. When all seven
factors are set to the optimistic variations, the probability estimate
becomes 7.3 percent. When all seven factors are set to the pessimistic
variations, the probability estimate becomes 91.2 percent. [**The
expected risk of nuclear war was 60.9 percent from three pathways
(crises, mishaps, and general conventional war).**]{.underline}
Estimates from these three pathways depend on ten basic factors that
were entered into to the model. When all ten factors are set to
optimistic variations, the probability estimate becomes 16.4 percent.
When all ten factors are set to pessimistic variations, the probability
estimate becomes 94.7 percent. Again, these ranges are not a license to
believe whatever one wishes on these matters. They are simply a spur for
further research to obtain more evidence, data, or analyses that could
refine these numbers. The pathways to accidental nuclear war can be
analyzed more carefully through engineering and process analyses, such
as is often applied to safety analyses of nuclear power plants and other
complex systems. Analyses of the pathways through conventional war or
international crises require further research in the behavioral and
social sciences. Future refinements of these estimates could just as
easily be more pessimistic as more optimistic. In the absence of such
further knowledge and sound reasons for arguing otherwise, there is no
reason to suppose these estimates of risk are grossly incorrect.
Fighting the Cold War with nuclear armaments and nuclear threats was a
perilous wager. **[The probability of a failure resulting in nuclear war
exceeded the probability of making an incorrect call while flipping a
coin.]{.underline}** The world must find a way to unwind this desperate
gamble. It is vital that all practical measures be considered and
effective measures taken to reduce or eliminate the continuing
unacceptable risk of nuclear war.

### No Solvency -- Ukraine-Russia War Inevitable

#### No solvency---Ukraine is only a board piece in the broader struggle between the West and Russia over security concerns in Europe---the War is inevitable

Jeremy **Shapiro**, 2-12-**2015**, \"An alternative to arming Ukraine,\"
Brookings,
<https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2015/02/12/an-alternative-to-arming-ukraine/>
JEJP

Our central point is that [Ukraine is actually just one battleground in
a broader struggle between Russia and the West over the regional order
in Europe.]{.underline} The Western concept of the post-Cold War
security order in Europe was that stability and prosperity come from
non-negotiable acceptance of the rules of Western organizations like the
European Union (EU) and NATO. Such a concept could never integrate a
country like Russia, both because Russia's multiplicity of economic,
social, and security problems require more flexibility than that, and
because Russia's sense of its own greatness would never allow it. The
West's effort, since the end of the Cold War, to treat Russia as a
normal European country with no greater sovereign rights than, say,
Luxembourg or Latvia, infuriates the hyper-nationalist lurking within
most Russian leaders. The continued Western insistence on this view of
Russia, even [as Russia's power has risen in recent years, convinces its
leaders that the [West will not stop until Russia is reduced to a level
of subservience to the United States similar to that of other European
countries.](http://eng.kremlin.ru/news/23570#sel=16:23,17:34)]{.underline}
Russian leaders see U.S. involvement in Ukraine in precisely this light.
[[As Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev put it on
February 10](http://sputniknews.com/europe/20150210/1018051955.html) ,
"The U.S. has been trying to entangle Russia in an interstate military
conflict and to make use of the developments in Ukraine for regime
change and, ultimately, for splitting our country." This means that
there is little point in negotiating or even fighting over Ukraine
alone. Even if, by some miracle, [the ceasefire negotiated in
Minsk](http://www.kyivpost.com/opinion/op-ed/a-complex-of-measures-to-fulfill-the-minsk-agreements-380395.html)holds,
or the Russians were forced by provision of arms to accept Western
demands vis-à-vis Ukraine, conflict would break out again, in Ukraine or
elsewhere, as long as the core dispute over the regional order remained
unresolved]{.underline}. [Instead, in order to solve the problem, we
need to begin a negotiation on the question of the European security
order and Russia's role within it.]{.underline} Russia has been asking
for this negotiation since at least 1989, but the West has never really
taken that request seriously. We now need to enter into a negotiation to
revise the European security order on terms acceptable to Russia and the
West.

[The United States and Russia are locked in an angry geopolitical
confrontation that threatens to spiral into direct military
conflict---even if neither country wants it. America's current strategy
toward Russia, simply put, is not working; instead, it's tying our
hands. It's making Russia more aggressive externally and less democratic
internally. The dangers are escalating. Diplomatic tools that prevented
armed conflict during the Cold War have atrophied; arms control and
verification regimes that helped provide strategic stability and prevent
a costly arms race are in danger of collapsing. The United States has
imposed dozens of sanctions on Russia that have had no apparent impact
on its foreign policy behavior. Official meetings and negotiating fora
have largely dried up, while citizen-to-citizen contacts have diminished
to the point where neither public understands the other. Meanwhile,
Russia has formed a de facto entente with China, our main global
competitor. Moscow is becoming bolder in challenging the United States
and its allies while expanding its regional and global trade and
security arrangements.]{.underline} To revise our strategy toward Russia
we must first define America's own long-term strategic interests. Our
paramount interest is national security. [Russia remains the only
country that can destroy the United States with nuclear weapons. Moscow
is developing a new generation of hypersonic weapons designed to evade
U.S. defenses and hit their targets with little or no
warning.]{.underline} It has the means to disrupt the American way of
life, even destroy our advanced weaponry, through cyber attacks against
U.S. computer networks. And, as we saw in 2016, it can exploit social
media to undermine our democracy with disinformation campaigns that
hearken back to the "active measures" of the Soviet period. [The United
States, of course, has the capability to harm Russia, which locks the
two countries in an embrace of mutual destruction.]{.underline}

# Russian Appeasement DA

## 1NC Shell

#### Trump currently is not pursuing an appeasement policy towards Russia -- deciding to send arms to Ukraine [specifically]{.underline} signals a hardline approach.

**Carpenter 3/25** (Ted Galen, Senior fellow in security studies at the
Cato Institute "The Myth that Won't Die: Donald Trump as Russia's
Puppet"
<https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/myth-wont-die-donald-trump-russias-puppet>)
NIJ

Donald [Trump's political adversaries]{.underline}, along with an
assortment of Russia haters in the foreign-policy community and the news
media, [keep pushing the narrative that Trump is Vladimir Putin's
puppet. That allegation shows few signs of dissipating even though no
credible evidence supporting it has emerged.]{.underline} Unfortunately,
the situation is unlikely to change even though Special Counsel Robert
[Mueller's investigation concluded that the Russian government's
meddling in the 2016 presidential election did not entail collusion with
the Trump campaign.]{.underline} Yet, shrill allegations of treason have
been commonplace, reaching a crescendo following last year's Trump-Putin
summit in Helsinki, when the president made some highly favorable
comments about his Russian counterpart. The innuendos and outright
accusations persist. And despite the bland outcome of the Mueller
investigation, congressional Democrats, most notably House Intelligence
Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA), insist that they will continue to
investigate the "Russia collusion" angle. Russophobes seem to believe
that if they repeat an absurdity often enough, it somehow becomes true.
The myth that Trump has been Putin's puppet falls into that category.
Trump did commit the apparently unpardonable sin during the 2016
campaign of advocating better relations with Moscow, and he was guilty
of using effusive diplomatic language at Helsinki. But if one examines
his administration's actual policies toward Russia, the notion that he
is "doing Putin's bidding" or even pursuing an appeasement policy
evaporates. [Critics who contend otherwise need to cite specific Trump
administration policies that Putin welcomes. It would be a very
difficult task. It certainly would not be Russian enthusiasm about
Trump's decision to end U.S. adherence to the Intermediate Nuclear
Forces (INF) Treaty. The Kremlin reacted firmly to that action and
warned that Washington's withdrawal from the INF Treaty would compel
Russia to develop new missiles ; in response, Russia would resume
targeting U.S. bases in Europe and important assets of America's NATO
allies. That is a curious reaction from Putin if his aim was to prompt
his puppet to take that step. **It is also unlikely that Russia is happy
about the Trump administration's approval of two major arms sales to
Ukraine.**]{.underline} The latter sale in spring 2018 even included
Javelin anti-tank missiles. Since Moscow backs a secessionist war in
eastern Ukraine and is on very bad terms overall with the government in
Kiev, **[the U.S. decision to boost the military capabilities of
Russia's nemesis is a hostile act, not one of
appeasement.]{.underline}** [Indeed, it is a step that Barack Obama
pointedly refused to take. A similar escalation of Washington's support
for Kiev is evident with the Trump administration's program to to train
Ukrainian troops. Given the Kremlin's hostility to the expansion of
NATO's membership]{.underline} (a stance that existed even before Putin
became president), [Trump's alleged master cannot be pleased that his
agent endorsed the admission of Montenegro to the alliance and is
adopting the same view of Macedonia's impending bid. Such expansion
probably is even more galling since it continues Washington's
contemptuous attitude regarding Russian political, cultural and economic
interests in the Balkans---a policy that goes back well into the
nineteenth century. Moscow must be even more unhappy about the Trump
administration's failure to back off from Washington's stated goal to
bring Georgia and Ukraine into NATO---a move that Russians across the
political spectrum regard as an intolerable provocation. It would be
peculiar if Putin was pleased about the frequent rotating deployments of
U.S. warplanes and military personnel to NATO members on Russia's
border. Indeed, the rotations are now so frequent that they amount to an
ongoing U.S. presence in all but name. That development is combined with
an intensification of both the number and size of NATO exercises (war
games) in both Eastern Europe and the Black Sea adjacent to
Russia.]{.underline} Given the reports that U.S. officials are now in
serious negotiations with Warsaw to build a permanent military base
(which the Polish president offered to name "Fort Trump" in a
transparent appeal to the U.S. president's notorious vanity) in eastern
Poland near the border with Russia; Putin's "puppet" appears to be
out-of-control. That problem also is apparent with respect to Trump's
treatment of Moscow's would-be allies and client states. Russia has
deployed its own military forces to Syria to help Bashar al-Assad retain
his precarious hold on power. Yet Trump has continued to back opposition
forces, and he launched missile strikes against Assad's air force in
response to his regime's supposed use of chemical weapons. Other attacks
on Syrian government positions have apparently killed approximately two
hundred Russian nationals working as contractors and mercenaries. The
Kremlin has pursued a policy of trying to forge close economic and even
military ties with Venezuela's leftist government headed by Nicolas
Maduro. Conversely, the Trump administration has clearly embarked on a
regime-change campaign to oust Maduro. Trump himself has insisted that
all options (implicitly including a military intervention) remain on the
table regarding that goal. It's hard to square such an aggressive stance
toward Russian clients like Assad and Maduro with the actions of someone
dedicated to appeasing Moscow, much less someone operating as a Russian
agent. **[It is long past time to scorn the "Trump is Putin's puppet"
allegation for the preposterous myth that it is. In reality, the Trump
administration has pursued a]{.underline}** disturbingly **[hardline
policy toward Russia]{.underline}**, deepening an already worrisome new
cold war. It is uncertain whether Trump's stance is an effort to
fend-off accusations of treason or if it merely reflects a dangerous
herd mentality in Washington about relations with Moscow. In either
case, the outcome has fomented unnecessary, potentially very dangerous,
bilateral tensions. If Trump's domestic political adversaries have
integrity and a sense of responsibility, then they will acknowledge that
the Mueller investigation did not find proof that Trump colluded with
Russia, and they will immediately abandon that ugly, false narrative.

#### Cutting arms sales to the Ukraine returns to the Obama-era policy of Russia appeasement---this [increases]{.underline} Russian aggression.

**Rothman 15** (Noah, Associate Editor of Commentary "America's
Appeasement of the Russian Bear"
<https://www.commentarymagazine.com/foreign-policy/europe/russia/americas-appeasement-of-the-russian-bear/>)
NIJ

[When charged with describing a policy of cowed deference to an
aggressor, a near pathological aversion among political commentators to
the word "appeasement" has hamstrung the West's ability to recognize
that policy when it is in practice.]{.underline} Just because the
disastrous Munich Agreement is often dubiously invoked does not mean
that it is never appropriate to call appeasement "appeasement." For
example, there is no better word than that to describe America's docile
response to Russian belligerence in its neighborhood[. Since the
collapse of the Soviet Union and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact,
U.S. policy toward the region has been to reject the notion that Moscow
deserves any special influence over either its former vassal states or
the republics that once made up the USSR.]{.underline} And, before 2008,
America meant it. In March of 2004, a slew of former Warsaw Pact nations
including three former Soviet Republics in the Baltics joined the NATO
alliance. [In April 2008, NATO issued a statement welcoming the
"Euro-Atlantic aspirations" of Ukraine and Georgia, both of which had
already begun the process of ascension into the alliance.]{.underline}
In January 2008, over 72 percent of the Georgian public voted in favor
of joining NATO in a non-binding referendum. That same month, Ukraine's
administration was presented with a petition signed by two million
Ukrainians demanding a similar referendum vote. The polls indicated that
it was destined for approval and that both states would soon formally
pursue a NATO Membership Action Plan (MAP). Everything changed that
August. On August 7, pro-Russian separatists began attacking Georgian
troops and giving Moscow the excuse it needed to intervene in the
conflict. On August 10, Russian forces poured over the Georgian border,
sacking city after city and eventually approaching the capital of
Tbilisi. The brief conflict was over in five days, but its effects were
far-reaching and permanent. The Georgian army was routed. Mikhail
Saakashvili's government was sapped of much of its legitimacy. The
provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia were effectively severed from
Georgian control and are now rogue breakaway proto-states that serve
Moscow's interests. The American reaction to Russia's aggression was
swift but insufficient. C-17s rushed humanitarian supplies to Tbilisi,
sanctions were imposed on Moscow, and elements of the American fleet
were soon parked off the country's coast in the Black Sea. It came too
late; the Russian army had achieved a swift victory. More disturbingly,
a new precedent had been set. From this point forward, Russian interests
in the territories it defined as its "near abroad" were to be respected.
[Barack Obama embraced the shortsighted policy of providing Moscow with
undue deference concerning its former Soviet sphere.]{.underline} The
president entered office married to the misperception that Bush-era
interventionism and "cowboy diplomacy" had led Vladimir Putin to embrace
irredentism. The president sacrificed the support of pro-Western
governments in Czech Republic and Poland to give Russia the gift of a
region free of interceptor missiles. The president acquiesced to Russian
demands that its client in Damascus, and Moscow's Syria-based
Mediterranean port, be preserved despite Bashar al-Assad's flagrant use
of chemical weapons on civilians. [Even after Russia invaded and annexed
Ukrainian territory, Barack Obama acceded to the Russian
demand]{.underline} that arms and ballistic missile embargos on Iran be
lifted as part of a nuclear accord -- creating new and legal markets for
Russian armaments. [Make no mistake; renewed Russian aggression in
Europe is owed to the Obama administration's careless telegraphing of
its disinterest in enforcing the prohibition on Russian interference in
the affairs of the former Soviet Republics. Washington did not react
with vehemence when Euromaidan protests evolved into civil conflict in
Kiev, prompting Russian armed forces to build up on its border with
Ukraine. Washington did not signal more than modest discomfort with
Russia's decision to take in former Ukrainian President Viktor
Yanukovych following his ouster. Finally and most egregiously,
Washington did not respond with appropriate resolve when Russian forces
invaded the Crimean Peninsula, sealed it off from Ukraine, installed a
puppet regime, and created the condition that led to its annexation into
Russia proper.]{.underline} In Fact, the Obama administration was
allegedly complicit in this violation of the post-World War II order in
Europe. According to the reporting of Bloomberg's Eli Lake and Josh
Rogin, Washington advised the interim government in Kiev to stand down
as Russian forces carved off Crimea. "As U.S. officials told us
recently, the White House feared that if the Ukrainian military fought
in Crimea, it would give Putin justification to launch greater military
intervention in Ukraine," the report read. "Looking back today, [many
experts and officials point to the decision not to stand and fight in
Crimea as the beginning of a Ukraine policy based on the assumption that
avoiding conflict with Moscow would temper Putin's aggression. **But
that was a miscalculation."** **Despite the acknowledgment that a policy
of submissiveness toward Russia was a miscalculation, this has not
compelled American officials to abandon it.**]{.underline} The Obama
administration responded to the invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent
destabilization of its eastern provinces in much the same way the Bush
administration did to the invasion of Georgia. [Washington provided
Ukrainian troops with non-lethal military and humanitarian
aid]{.underline}, imposed sanctions on Moscow, and moved naval assets to
the region. [None of this has had the effect of tempering Putin's
aggression. Indeed, the Kremlin has only grown more erratic, more
insular, and more unstable.]{.underline} In September of last year, the
Russian military pulled off an under-reported coup. Using smoke grenades
and communications jamming technology, Russian operatives allegedly
violated Estonian territory and kidnapped a border guard. Under the
pretense that this Estonian soldier had crossed over into Russian
territory, he was captured and transported to Moscow to stand trial.
Russia reneged on a promise to release him earlier this year and,
instead, sentenced the soldier to 15 years of hard labor. "Estonia's
president, Toomas Henrik Ilves, has compared this to cases of Soviet
troops killing Baltic border guards prior to the Soviet invasion and
takeover of the Baltic states in 1940," COMMENTARY's Max Boot noted. The

been little else in the way of condemnation for this egregious violation
of the sovereignty of an NATO-member state. **[America's policy toward
Russia is one of appeasement]{.underline}** and, despite assurances to
the contrary, the respect of Russian rights in its Soviet-era zone of

emboldened Moscow as a result.]{.underline}**

"Putin is preparing to fight and win a limited nuclear war against the
West, Skobov says"

NIJ

**[Putin is preparing to fight and win a limited nuclear war, convinced
that "the effete West will refuse to escalate" in response lest that
lead to a nuclear Armageddon that will destroy both the Russian
Federation and the West]{.underline}**, according to Moscow commentator
Aleksandr Skobov. [The Cold War doctrine was based on the assumption
that neither super power would ever use nuclear weapons for offense but
only in defense and that both would be prepared to escalate if the other
acted first, an assumption that provided less certainty that war could
be avoided than many now believe]{.underline}, Skobov says. On the one
hand, [each side had developed plans for using tactical and then
strategic weapons if the other side used them. And on the other, the
commentator continues, both had to continue to invest in ever more
apocalyptic weapons as the last line of defense of what each viewed as
its civilizational model.]{.underline} According to Skobov, "both sides
were certain of the superiority of their own social system and in the
eventual collapse of the social system of their opponent in a global
defeat in the historical competition." In essence, "both sides
considered a global military clash with their historical opponents as
practically inevitable." Moreover, [both sides concluded that they might
be pushed to the use of nuclear weapons if the use of conventional ones
was not allowing them to win out.]{.underline} NATO doctrine held that
in the event of a Soviet tank thrust into Europe, the western alliance
would have to use tactical nuclear weapons. "In the USSR," Skobov
continues, "the doctrine of 'a responsive nuclear strike' was adopted
officially, but in fact, the General Staff considered a sufficient basis
for a \[Soviet\] nuclear strike only the possibility that the first
strike might be inflicted by \[the USSR's\] opponents." And because
neither side could be certain what might happen, each was prepared to
escalate in response, something that both sides recognized and that was
ultimately the reason that neither side used those weapons against the
other lest its civilizational model be destroyed along with the world.
"Until Gorbachev's perestroika," Skobov says, "all attempts not only to
begin the process of disarmament or even to freeze the number of weapons
at a certain level turned out to be hopeless" as a result. "All
'pre-perestroika' Soviet-American treaties were only agreements about
reducing the tempo of the building of arms." The world was thus drifting
toward a nuclear war, a horrific outcome that was prevented only by the
decision of the Soviet leadership under Gorbachev to reject its global
political goals, its ideology, its faith in the supremacy of its social
system, and its efforts to impose that system on others by defeating its
opponent. By refusing to view the West as an inevitable enemy, the
Soviet leadership made possible arms control deals that reduced the
number of nuclear weapons of the two sides by 80 percent. "Russian
imperialists call this a geopolitical capitulation, but the alternative
to it was nuclear war," Skobov argues. But now what Gorbachev did is
being reversed. [Putin's "organized criminal group" even though it has
not articulated an ideology views itself as "'the elect of history,'
called upon to send into the trash heap all this 'Western project' with
its 'false democracy,' 'false' humanism, and 'false' human
rights."]{.underline} This is not "a return to Soviet ideology," Skobov
insists. "The Soviet empire claimed that namely it was the true legal
heir of the Renaissance-Enlightenment project and the heir of 1789 which
proclaimed 'freedom, equality, and brotherhood.'" The Putinists, in
contrast, "are convinced that there are no 'true' human rights and that
democracy doesn't exist in nature." [For Putin and his acolytes, "there
is only loot and crude force and the eternal universal laws of criminal
groups."]{.underline} It "doesn't seek to be the heir of 1789: it
rejects that inheritance just as Hitler did." And that points up
something else: ["the ideological gap separating the Putin empire and
the West is much deeper than the one which divided the West and the
Soviet empire." Putin's "organized criminal group" may not believe that
Western elites have any moral limitations, "but it cannot but understand
that NATO does not have a single reason in the event of a military
conflict to use nuclear weapons first." That is because today, NATO has
superiority over Russia "in other kinds of arms."]{.underline} Equally,
the Putin people "cannot but know" that neither side has an effective
defense against strategic nuclear missiles "and in the coming decades
won't" either. To ensure that the principles of mutually assured
destruction continue to work as a constraint, Skobov says, "no new
"super weapons" are needed. [Then, why is Putin talking about them? In
fact, he isn't talking about strategic weapons that could be used to
bring on Armageddon but rather precisely targeted ones that could serve
as the weapon of choice for "a limited nuclear strike, including a first
strike" rather than in response to the actions of the West.]{.underline}
Putin is "certainly not preparing for complete mutual destruction,"
Skobov says. **["He is preparing for a limited nuclear war which he
hopes to win."]{.underline}** His hopes rest on his conviction that the
West now will not respond to a Russian use of tactical nuclear weapons
by escalating but by doing everything possible to de-escalate. As in the
first Cold War, the commentator continues, **["the world's slide toward
a nuclear catastrophe can be stopped only by Russia turning away from
its confrontation with the West"]{.underline}** based on Moscow's belief
that its system is superior and the West's is rotting from within
because it is not. But tragically, ["today there are no forces within
the country capable of turning Russia" in a different direction. And the
world is rapidly running out of time.]{.underline} "Therefore," Skobov
says, "the first order of business is the formation of a broad
international anti-Putin coalition, which recognizes the threat coming
from the Kremlin and is ready to respond to Putin's strike."

## Uniqueness

### Uniqueness -- Trump Hardlining Russia

#### Trump has been the toughest on Russia since the Cold War.

**Horsley 18** (Scott, NPR\'s Chief Economics Correspondent "Is Trump
The Toughest Ever On Russia?"
<https://www.npr.org/2018/07/20/630659379/is-trump-the-toughest-ever-on-russia>)
NIJ

President Trump is in the process of inviting Russian President Vladimir
Putin to come to Washington, D.C., this fall to continue the talks they
started in Helsinki earlier this week. It\'s another sign of Trump\'s
efforts to build closer ties with Moscow, even though he insists his
administration has taken a hard line toward Russia. [\"There\'s never
been a president as tough on Russia as I have been,\" Trump told
reporters]{.underline} on Wednesday. That might sound like hyperbole,
but in this case, [there\'s actually some basis for the president\'s
boast.]{.underline} [\"When you actually look at the substance of what
this administration has done, not the rhetoric but the substance, this
administration has been much tougher on Russia than any in the post-Cold
War era,\"]{.underline} said Daniel Vajdich, senior fellow at the
Atlantic Council. Take military spending: [Trump sought to add \$1.4
billion for fiscal year 2018 to the European Deterrence Initiative --- a
military effort to deter Russian aggression that was initially known as
the European Reassurance Initiative. That\'s a 41 percent increase from
the last year of the Obama administration. **The president also agreed
to send lethal weapons to Ukraine --- a step that Obama resisted.** And
Trump gave U.S. forces in Syria more leeway to engage with Russian
troops.]{.underline} \"Those loosened rules of engagement have resulted
in direct military clashes with Russian militants and mercenaries on the
ground, actually resulting in one incident in hundreds of casualties on
the Russian side,\" Vajdich said. The administration has also imposed
sanctions on dozens of Russian oligarchs and government officials. And
Trump has aggressively promoted U.S. energy exports, although so far
that hasn\'t created much competition for Russia\'s oil and gas.
\"Russian gas sales to Europe last year were at record levels,\" said Ed
Chow, who studies energy and national security at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies. \"Russians will always have a cost
advantage. And if they want to protect market share, all they have to do
is lower the price.\" Whatever tough policies the White House may have
adopted toward Moscow also have to be weighed against Trump\'s rhetoric,
which is consistently friendly to Putin. He suggested inviting Russia to
rejoin the G-7, a group Moscow was suspended from following the illegal
annexation of Crimea. Trump also congratulated Putin on his suspect
re-election victory, despite explicit instructions from his advisers.
[\"There\'s a real disconnect between the president\'s words and the
underlying policy,\"]{.underline} said Richard Fontaine, president of
the Center for a New American Security. While Trump has no qualms about
criticizing leaders of allied countries like Germany\'s Angela Merkel,
Canada\'s Justin Trudeau or the U.K.\'s Theresa May, he almost always
treats Putin with kid gloves. \"The president very rarely speaks about
Putin\'s transgressions and when asked about them expresses the hope
that everyone can get along,\" said Fontaine, a former national security
adviser to Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Just last week, Trump told
reporters in the U.K., \"If we could develop a relationship which is
good for Russia, good for us, good for everybody, that would be great.\"
He went on to remind May how he agreed to expel 60 Russians ---
diplomats and suspected intelligence agents --- last year in retaliation
for the suspected poisoning of an ex-spy in Britain. \"And Germany did
three,\" he added grimly. The Washington Post reported Trump was
irritated that the U.S. seemed to be taking stronger actions against
Moscow than the Europeans were. The president was also reportedly
reluctant to send those lethal weapons to Ukraine, arguing again that
Europe should take the lead. [However grudging Trump\'s moves against
Moscow might have been, though, his defenders say the actions speak for
themselves.]{.underline} \"It is hard for me to believe that he was
dragged kicking and screaming through each and every one of these
decisions,\" Vajdich said.

Escalation Scenarios," 3/28/18,
<https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/03/28/three-escalation-scenarios-pub-75882>,
AS)

[The]{.underline} first [scenario **starts with a Russian land grab in
the Baltics.**]{.underline} To be very clear, this is an extreme
scenario; an overwhelming majority of Western experts, including NATO
staff, consider it to be a "remote" possibility.1 Nevertheless, [there
are good reasons to consider this]{.underline} extreme [set of
circumstances. First, it is a high-risk scenario, based on low
probability but **with high potential consequences**. Second, many
allies are worried about it.]{.underline} [And third, this scenario
might look less unlikely after the Russian use of force in Georgia and
Ukraine. Stage One:]{.underline} The year 2018 sees the return of
large-scale protests to major Russian cities. Suddenly, Vladimir Putin's
hold on power no longer seems a given. Only two weeks after the first
protests, [the Russian General Staff announces a large military exercise
in Russia's Western Military District, close to the border of
Latvia.]{.underline} Implications: [This combination of events would put
NATO on notice]{.underline} about the internal developments in Russia
and the announced military exercise, [and]{.underline} these events
would [raise serious concerns that Russia's leadership might be planning
to create an international crisis to divert attention from a domestic
crisis.]{.underline} At the same time, however, strong voices within
NATO would almost certainly caution against overreacting to these
events. They could argue that if NATO were to react militarily---by, for
example, deciding to send temporary reinforcements, even perhaps only
one additional battalion---to alleviate the concerns of Baltic nations,
doing so would risk giving the Kremlin reason to up the ante. Indeed,
deploying EFP forces in the region to the border area or even just
raising their state of alert might be perceived by Russia as an
aggressive move. Given these trade-offs, [it is quite likely that NATO
would react in a rather reserved way, which would give Russia an
important advantage in terms of mobilizing its forces. Stage Two: Sudden
protests by the Russian minority community in Latvia's easternmost
Latgale region spiral out of control with several
fatalities.]{.underline} While NATO ambassadors are gathering for an
emergency meeting, [Putin warns NATO "not to interfere in the internal
affairs of Latvia" and assures his domestic audience that "**Russia will
not idly stand by as Russians are being slaughtered
abroad."**]{.underline} Implications: For the alliance, [the sudden
occurrence of serious protests in Latvia---whether or not instigated by
Moscow---in conjunction with a domestic crisis in Russia and an arms
buildup close to Latvia would immediately raise the severity of the
crisis. The possibility of Russia escalating]{.underline} the conflict
with NATO, which might have seemed rather low at Stage One, [would
suddenly become more realistic.]{.underline} (Indeed, similar Russian
statements about the security of Russians living abroad were made ahead
of Moscow's interventions in Georgia and Ukraine.2) For the alliance,
sudden protests in Latvia---in conjunction with a domestic crisis in
Russia and an arms buildup close to Latvia--- would immediately raise
the severity of the crisis. [That said, there would nonetheless still be
a real possibility that allies would hold divergent interpretations of
these events]{.underline}, and it is unclear whether the EFP would be
ordered to immediately leave its base near Riga, at least to patrol the
border with Russia.3 Even though NATO insists that the EFP has no role
to play in a domestic unrest scenario, some allies might question that
logic, given that events may be instigated by Russia as it looked to
invade. Debates at NATO Headquarters on these issues could get
acrimonious. Some allies would probably worry that such actions as well
as NATO preparations to send additional forces to the region could be
escalatory. The alliance could well look, and perhaps be, divided.
[Again, NATO might still wait to avoid giving Russia any pretext to
intervene. Stage Three: Russian forces cross the border into Latvia and
occupy the Latgale region. President Putin makes a press announcement
that "Russia's humanitarian intervention stops here and now." **NATO
defense ministers meet and issue an ultimatum, demanding full Russian
withdrawal.**]{.underline} Implications: At this point, debates within
NATO about the severity of the Russian threat would be overtaken by
events. **[NATO would be presented with a military fait
accompli.]{.underline}** While [this situation]{.underline} already
would be very challenging to handle, it [might be further complicated if
Russian forces met only minimal resistance from Latvian forces and
perhaps none at all from the EFP.]{.underline} (Given the distance
between their base in Riga and the Latgale region, there would be a
serious risk that they would not arrive quickly enough to resist Russian
forces.) In this case, [regional EFP commanders]{.underline}---who, in
the case of Latvia, come from six different contributing
nations---[might be confronted with a choice between engaging
immediately in a futile fight that they would be certain to lose or
holding back to await further instructions from NATO
Headquarters.]{.underline} Worse still, some commanders might even
receive orders from their own national commands, bypassing the NATO
chain of command and possibly complicating a collective response. [One
potential outcome would be paralysis. Conversely, there would also be a
real possibility that an EFP commander---having received divergent
orders from NATO, the host nation (Latvia), and national lines of
command]{.underline}---[might decide to engage in combat before NATO's
political leaders have decided to invoke Article V.]{.underline}
Regardless of exactly how the fight was playing out in the theater, [the
NAC would]{.underline}, at this stage, [have to determine **whether or
not to invoke Article V** and whether or not to go to war with
Russia]{.underline} in an environment where the scope of the Russian
campaign would still look rather limited (as no allied forces from
France, Germany, the United Kingdom, or the United States would be
involved yet). Even if Article V were triggered, certain allies might
still advocate for a diplomatic solution. A possible compromise might
see allies starting immediate preparations for military reinforcement in
parallel with heightened crisis diplomacy. [Stage Four: NATO is ready to
deploy the Spearhead Force from Ramstein, Germany, and starts
preparations for assembling the rest of the eNRF.]{.underline}
Simultaneously, [the United States starts flying in additional personnel
and equipment]{.underline} to Western Europe and Poland. [Putin claims
that "NATO is provoking an unnecessary war."]{.underline} In many
European capitals tens of thousands take to the streets, urging Russia
and NATO to "end the mutual violence." Implications: NATO, having
started its military preparations, would face another tough choice.
While the Spearhead would be ready in less than a week, assembling the
rest of the eNRF would take longer (in all likelihood, a couple of
weeks). A decision would have to be made whether to deploy the Spearhead
right away, and risk losing it almost immediately in the theater, or to
wait for assembling the full manpower of the eNRF. If NATO were to wait,
the louder the voices of opposition to any military response could grow.
Indeed, large-scale protests in Western Europe, perhaps fueled by
subversive Russian propaganda, would very likely further affect and
complicate NATO's political decisionmaking.4 [In this
situation]{.underline}, some allies might opt out of a military
response, while others---[the United Kingdom and the United
States]{.underline}, most likely---[could bypass NATO's slow
mobilization process and **move forward with their own deployment
plans.** This contingency]{.underline}---in which some allies hesitate
to engage and others push forward---[could effectively paralyze the
alliance]{.underline} as a collective decisionmaking entity. In any
case[, NATO might well have to deal]{.underline}, at some point, [with
further Russian efforts to escalate the conflict by targeting critical
NATO transportation nodes]{.underline} with precision-guided
conventional strikes so as to prevent or at least complicate NATO
preparations for retaliation.5 From a Russian perspective, waiting for
NATO to muster a force of perhaps 100,000 personnel---which is what
would be required to be credible enough to fight a regional war with
Russia with the aim of retaking and securing the Baltics or perhaps even
extending combat operations into Russian territory---would hardly be an
option.6 In any case, NATO might well have to deal, at some point, with
further Russian efforts to escalate the conflict by targeting critical
NATO transportation nodes. But [even if Russia were to shy away from
further escalation]{.underline} (it might, for example, decide against
striking Western Europe because of the risk that doing so would unify
the alliance), [NATO's next move---laying the groundwork for force
deployment to the Baltics---would almost necessarily involve
**escalating the conflict horizontally into Russian
territory.**]{.underline} Because NATO has decided against
pre-positioning heavy military equipment in the Baltics, allies would
have to fly in personnel and equipment with large transportation
aircraft, which would be easy targets for Russian air defense systems
around the Baltic Rim. [If NATO wanted to avoid losing much of its first
reinforcement wave]{.underline} before it actually reached the ground,
[it would have to target Russian anti-access and area denial
installations, effectively extending combat operations into Russian
territory. Stage Five: NATO receives intelligence reports that Russia is
readying some of its tactical nuclear weapons stored in western Russia.
Putin warns that "**the two sides are on the brink of a nuclear
armageddon.**"]{.underline} Implications: Assuming that NATO had decided
on a concrete deployment plan by this point, [NATO leaders would have to
decide whether to move forward]{.underline} given the possibility of
Russia escalating to actual nuclear use. [That decision]{.underline}
would almost certainly cause serious frictions within the alliance and
[could further delay a military response.]{.underline} If NATO leaders
weathered those quarrels and pressed on, NATO might then immediately be
confronted with a second serious dilemma, stemming from NATO's
long-standing internal disputes about its nuclear deterrent. [Over the
years, Russia might have arrived at the conclusion that NATO would not
use nuclear weapons]{.underline}---even in response to Russian nuclear
use---[in a limited regional scenario.]{.underline} As a result, [Moscow
might feel tempted to escalate to nuclear use in the hope of stopping
NATO in its tracks before it could deploy forces.]{.underline} In this
case, **[all of NATO's possible nuclear
countermeasures]{.underline}**---rhetorical nuclear threats; so-called
slow nuclear signals in the form of readying NATO's forward-deployed
nuclear forces (which would take a few weeks); or so-called fast
signals, such as U.S. B-52 deployments to Western Europe (which could be
executed within hours)---[**could be misperceived in Moscow as mere
bluffs.** The interplay between Russia doubting NATO's resolve and NATO
having difficulties making its nuclear threats credible would create a
**number of pathways for escalation through misperception.** One
possibility would be NATO proceeding with its deployment
preparations]{.underline} absent its own distinct response to Russia's
nuclear threats. [In this event, Russia might escalate to nuclear use
out of concern that a regional conventional war with NATO could result
in a Russian defeat, and perhaps the loss of Kaliningrad or even other
Russian territory. According to two Russian military experts, "Strategic
deterrence]{.underline} with conventional weapons of a potential
aggressor state (or coalition of states) from undertaking a large-scale
or regional war is unlikely. It [**is possible only by the threat of
preventive nuclear actions.**"]{.underline}7 [Stage Six: U.S. satellites
detect a small-yield nuclear explosion over a remote area in the North
Sea.]{.underline} Implications: At this point, NATO would face the dire
situation of Russia having escalated to actual nuclear use in the form
of a single demonstration strike over international waters. [The Russian
strike would]{.underline} most likely [not eradicate the dilemmas NATO
would be facing]{.underline} already at Stage Five, when Russia was only
threatening nuclear use, [but instead make those dilemmas more
pressing.]{.underline} In concrete terms, [NATO members would now have
to decide whether to move forward with the alliance's deployment plans,
stop in its tracks (obviously intimidated by Russian nuclear use),
or]{.underline} perhaps [**respond with nuclear use.**]{.underline} The
latter option---nuclear use by the allies---in particular would most
likely be highly contested within NATO. Given that the Russian
demonstration strike would not have been directed against NATO
territory, the risk of further nuclear escalation if NATO were to
reciprocate, rapidly mounting domestic pressures in Western Europe to
"avoid a nuclear holocaust," and NATO's (though comparably slow) ability
to muster a significant conventional force, [the alliance's members
might decide against nuclear use]{.underline}. At the same time, [that
might only help to **reinforce the Russian (mis)perception** that NATO
really tends to shy away from nuclear use in a crisis.]{.underline} NATO
would therefore be hard-pressed to show serious nuclear signals below
the level of actual use, such as U.S. B-52 deployments to Western
Europe. In turn, Russia, having just escalated to nuclear use, would
face a no less dire situation, given that Moscow might feel that it had
played its final card in an escalatory game aimed at preventing NATO
from deploying forces to the Baltics. [If NATO were to continue with its
mobilization and deployment plans, Russia would have little choice other
than to escalate the conflict further into NATO
territory]{.underline}---perhaps by aiming conventional strikes at
NATO's western transportation nodes or perhaps by conducting additional
nuclear strikes---or back down. Either way, Moscow would have to fear
that its escalation strategy would solidify NATO's assertiveness rather
than undermine its cohesion.

Vladimir [Putin's war against Ukraine has now entered its sixth year.
This is not a frozen conflict. More than 10,000 Ukrainians have been
killed, and that number grows each week.]{.underline} And on Nov. 25 of
last year, the Kremlin leader escalated his war of aggression, and even
expanded it into a new domain by attacking and seizing three Ukrainian
naval vessels and detaining 24 Ukrainian sailors in violation of
international law. They remain Putin's captives. Finally, more than 100
days since that attack, the free world has begun to respond. I welcome
President Donald Trump's recent decision, along with our Canadian and
European allies, to impose additional sanctions on Russian officials.
This is a powerful first step. But it must not be the only step. [**The
free world must respond with urgency and strength --- not just to a
single attack, but to Putin's broader campaign to undermine Ukrainian
sovereignty and the free institutions the country seeks to join.**
Additional U.S. sanctions must be on the table to impose direct costs on
Putin and his henchmen. We should also work closely with the NATO
alliance to enhance our military presence and capabilities in the Black
Sea region. Most of all, the United States should develop a long-term
plan for security assistance to Ukraine]{.underline} --- a plan that
truly reflects the stakes of this conflict not just for Ukraine, but for
the United States. Last year, [Ukraine received its first lethal aid
from the United States thanks to the Trump administration's approval of
a sale of Javelin anti-tank missiles --- a critical step the Obama
administration refused to take despite bipartisan support in Congress.
The Trump administration also notified Congress in February that, for
the first time since its creation in 2015, funds for the Department of
Defense's Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative will be used to provide
lethal aid, including sniper rifles and shoulder-fired grenade
launchers. I commend the administration for these two "firsts." Now it's
time to increase funding for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative,
as well as the State Department's security assistance programs. And a
larger share of this funding should go to support defensive lethal aid
that will make Ukraine a more difficult target for Putin's aggression.
After Putin's Black Sea attack, Ukraine's maritime capabilities must be
enhanced by accelerating acquisition of coastal defense radars, patrol
boats, coastal defense and anti-ship missiles and other systems. On the
ground, Ukraine needs more Javelins, other anti-tank weapons, electronic
warfare systems and advanced counterartillery radars. And in the air, we
should examine how to assist Ukraine in improving its air
defenses.]{.underline}

weapons to Kyiv, while President Donald Trump changed course. Some
experts warn that giving Ukraine lethal defensive weapons will only
enrage the Russians and escalate the war, while others, including
[Atlantic Council
experts](https://www.brookings.edu/research/preserving-ukraines-independence-resisting-russian-aggression-what-the-united-states-and-nato-must-do/),
have insisted that [arming Ukraine is the most effective way to change
the facts on the ground and force Russian President Vladimir Putin to
finally negotiate. In 2017, the US Congress approved a \$47 million
military-aid package that included 210 Javelin antitank missiles and
thirty-seven Javelin launchers, but the State Department refuses to say
how many weapons have been delivered.]{.underline} UkraineAlert asked
its experts the following: What difference will the arrival of the
Javelins make militarily and politically in the four-year conflict
between Russia and Ukraine? Is this a game-changer? Ian Brzezinski,
Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Center on
International Security: [This delivery of Javelins is an operationally
and geopolitically significant demonstration of US determination to
support Ukraine, an action long overdue following Russia's 2014
invasion]{.underline}. [Javelins]{.underline} alone will not enable Kyiv
to force Russia out of Crimea and Donbas, but they [substantively
increase Ukraine's ability to impose costs on Russian forces. The
Javelins will also likely reanimate among Russian commanders
uncomfortable memories of the role that US shoulder-mounted Stinger
air-defense missiles played in forcing the Soviet Union's
retreat]{.underline} from Afghanistan in the late 1980s. In these ways,
the **[Javelins will help to deter further Russian seizures of Ukrainian
territory]{.underline}**. However, they need to be complemented with
additional military support to Ukraine, a more robust NATO posture in
Central Europe, and more aggressive economic sanctions against Russia if
Putin is to be convinced to end his occupation of Crimea and eastern
Ukraine. Finally, it\'s important to remember that Ukraine is paying for
these missiles. It would be far better if Ukraine reformed its defense
industry so that it could produce and sell anti-tank weapons itself,
rather than having to buy them from Western countries. The Russian
threat to Ukraine is not only in the Donbas, but also from a potential
massive ground invasion from Russia with the purpose to occupy all of
Ukraine. Therefore, the Obama administration failed to supply this and
other lethal weapon systems when it was necessary. These systems needed
to be airlifted and Ukrainian troops immediately trained to use them in
the spring and summer of 2014. The supply of these weapons may be
signaling to Russia that the United States is very slow and will not
respond with adequate strength and in a timely manner in the case of a
major engagement. Additionally, Ukraine has a massive military
industrial complex that is capable of producing its own small weapons,
including antitank missiles. The United States will be well advised to
share some of its military technology, and provide technical assistance
to modernize and boost production in Ukraine. Peter Dickinson,
Nonresident Fellow at the Atlantic Council and publisher of Business
Ukraine and Lviv Today magazines: The arrival of the US javelins is very
welcome news for Ukraine---especially [given all the skepticism and
cynicism surrounding earlier delivery delays.]{.underline} It is a
largely symbolic move that will not change the military realities on the
ground, but [it will certainly resonate loudly in the
Kremlin]{.underline}. [Supplying weapons to Ukraine is a major
escalation in America\'s support for Kyiv and is in direct defiance of
repeated Russian warnings that any such move would lead to fresh rounds
of bloodshed.]{.underline} This apparent willingness to call the
Kremlin\'s bluff reflects the shift in initiative away from Moscow as
Russia\'s limited options in eastern Ukraine become more and more
obvious. [First, Javelins are a very effective antitank weapon and its
supplies along with other assistance will make Ukraine stronger and
increase the costs of further Russian advance in eastern Ukraine.
Second, but no less important, is the political meaning of the delivery
of Javelins. It is a strong signal indicating the resoluteness of US
support to Ukraine, and it really matters. The delivery of the Javelins
should also serve as an example for other Western allies, opening the
door for further supplies of lethal defensive weapons to
Ukraine.]{.underline}

#### **US arms sales to Ukraine would help decrease the chance of a US-Russia conflict**

United States Ambassador to Uzbekistan from 2000 to 2003 and United
States Ambassador to Ukraine from September 2003 to May 2006.
08-08-2017, \"Why the Case Against Arming Ukraine Doesn't Hold Water,\"
Atlantic Council,
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/arm-ukraine-now-2)

[Armchair strategists have come out of the woodwork to explain why it
would be a mistake for the United States to arm Ukraine.]{.underline}
They argue that Russia is stronger than Ukraine and can outmatch any
escalation, Moscow has a greater interest in Ukraine than Washington,
and Ukraine's government is corrupt and undeserving of such support.
[These arguments are based on hoary myths, outdated analyses, and an
incomplete understanding of Kremlin policy and American
interests.]{.underline} In "[Don't Arm
Ukraine](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/450140/arming-ukraine-bad-idea),"
Michael Brendan Dougherty claims that "Ukraine is a deeply divided
country," echoing the infamous CIA National Intelligence Estimate from
the 1990s that said Ukraine might split in two. But that prediction
proved false and, while differences between east and west Ukraine have
not disappeared, they have lessened considerably since 2014. Dougherty
wrongly asserts that "Russian-speaking Ukrainians see the United States
as complicit in overturning a democratic result in 2015." First, he
probably meant 2014, when President Viktor Yanukovych fled following
massive protests. Second, the vast majority of Ukrainians speak Russian
and the vast majority of Ukrainians welcomed Yanukovych's departure
after he either ordered or permitted the use of snipers against
demonstrators. It is true that the Kremlin is peddling the falsehood
that the United States was responsible for Yanukovych's ouster, but it
has gained little traction even in the parts of the country where
sympathy toward Moscow was once substantial. That sympathy is [much
reduced](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/russia-still-in-denial-over-the-loss-of-ukraine)
because of the Kremlin's ongoing war in Ukraine. Dougherty observes that
"successive governments in Kyiv have turned out to be ineffective and/or
hopelessly corrupt." While there is much truth in this statement, it is
incomplete and ultimately misleading. Under Poroshenko, [reform in
Ukraine has been
impressive](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/reform-in-ukraine-surpassing-expectations-and-public-perceptions).
The government has cleaned up the banking sector, introduced a
transparent system for government procurement, and moved toward a
single, market price for natural gas. This last measure cleaned up the
country's most corrupt sector, removed its dependence on Russia for
natural gas, and reduced its budget deficit by 80 percent. While
corruption remains a major problem, the IMF and EBRD give Ukraine good
marks overall for reform, especially since these efforts are taking
place in the midst of a war. Former NSC Senior Director Charles Kupchan
[joins](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2017/08/07/why-giving-ukraine-lethal-weapons-would-be-a-massive-mistake/?utm_term=.833756ab55b6)
Dougherty in claiming that the United States has no major interests in
Ukraine. But as Secretary of Defense James Mattis has [pointed
out](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/06/12/pentagon-chief-declares-north-korea-the-new-top-threat-to-u-s-security/?utm_term=.16fde4ca91ad),
Russia is "resurgent and more aggressive" and has placed the
"international order under assault." Moscow is the world's other nuclear
superpower with the second or third most powerful conventional military.
Russian President Vladimir Putin claims the right to intervene on behalf
of ethnic Russians and Russian speakers wherever they live and wants a
sphere of influence within the former Soviet Union, if not beyond. To
achieve these aims, he went to war with Georgia in 2008 and has been at
war with Ukraine since 2014. His ambitions go far beyond Ukraine. The
United States has a vital interest in keeping the peace in Europe, and a
vital interest in the strength and viability of NATO and the European
Union. The Kremlin seeks to weaken both institutions and the ties
binding the United States to Europe. [The most cost efficient way to
counter the Kremlin's revisionist policies is to increase the cost of
its aggression in Ukraine.]{.underline} Thanks to Congress, we are
raising the economic costs on Moscow through sanctions. But that is not
sufficient. [Another error in Dougherty's article is the suggestion that
the Russian public, like the Putin government, is "willing to lose
troops in battle." Kupchan shares this view, claiming that the master
public manipulator Putin "would hardly fold his hand if Russian
casualties were to increase." In fact, numerous polls by the Levada
Center, the premier Russian polling institution, show that Russians do
not want their soldiers fighting in Ukraine.]{.underline} For that
reason, Putin hides his casualties from the public. Providing defensive
arms to Ukraine---[specifically Javelin missiles that destroy
tanks---would make it harder for the Kremlin to conduct additional
offensives because it would mean more Russian casualties. Leonid
Bershidsky
[argues](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-08-01/sending-defensive-arms-to-ukraine-would-be-deadly)
that it is futile to send anti-tank weapons to Ukraine because Moscow
has 20,000 tanks and can always provide more. In addition, he asserts,
there have been few changes in territory around the contact line over
the past two years and, therefore, anti-tank weapons would be used in a
Ukrainian effort to take back the territories currently occupied by
Moscow. This is simply wrong. Ukrainians have fought the Kremlin to a
standstill, but there are casualties every day, and since the Minsk II
ceasefire, Moscow has taken hundreds of additional square kilometers of
Ukrainian territory. Providing anti-tank missiles will help deter Moscow
from taking more.]{.underline} Kupchan also claims that sending arms
would "cause a rift between the United States and its main European
allies." While Germany and France oppose the move, Chancellor Angela
Merkel has said and German officials have told me privately that if the
United States provided arms, they would still cooperate with Washington
on seeking peace in Ukraine. The United States made a commitment to
guarantee Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity when it gave
up its nuclear weapons in 1994. [Providing defensive weapons to Ukraine
will]{.underline} honor that commitment and raise the cost of the war
for Moscow. Over time, that may [help persuade the Kremlin to withdraw
from the Donbas. Even if it does not, it will force Moscow to waste
additional resources in Ukraine and make them think twice about
challenging us in the Baltics, where our NATO commitments would compel
us to respond more forcefully. **Providing defensive weapons to Ukraine
actually decreases the odds of a dangerous US-Russian
confrontation**.]{.underline}

There is a new normal in America: our government may shut down, but our
wars continue. [Congress may not be able to pass a budget, but the U.S.
military can still launch commando raids in Libya and Somalia, the
Afghan War can still be prosecuted, Italy can be garrisoned by American
troops]{.underline} (putting the "empire" back in Rome), Africa can be
used as an imperial playground (as in the late nineteenth century
"scramble for Africa," but with the U.S. and China doing the scrambling
this time around), and [the military-industrial complex can still
dominate the world's **arms trade**. In the halls of Congress and the
Pentagon, it's business as usual, if your definition of "business" is
the power and profits you get from constantly preparing for and
prosecuting wars around the world. "War is a racket,"]{.underline}
General Smedley Butler famously declared in 1935, and even now it's hard
to disagree with a man who had two Congressional Medals of Honor to his
credit and was intimately familiar with American imperialism. War Is
Politics, Right? Once upon a time, as a serving officer in the U.S. Air
Force, I was taught that Carl von Clausewitz had defined war as a
continuation of politics by other means. This definition is, in fact, a
simplification of his classic and complex book, On War, written after
his experiences fighting Napoleon in the early nineteenth century. [The
idea of war as a continuation of politics is]{.underline} both
moderately interesting and [dangerously misleading: interesting because
it connects war to political processes and suggests that they should be
fought for political goals; misleading because it suggests that war is
essentially rational and so controllable.]{.underline} The fault here is
not Clausewitz's, but the American military's for misreading and
oversimplifying him. Perhaps another "Carl" might lend a hand when it
comes to helping Americans understand what war is really all about. I'm
referring to Karl Marx, who admired Clausewitz, notably for his idea
that combat is to war what a cash payment is to commerce. [However
seldom combat]{.underline} (or such payments) [may happen, they are the
culmination and so the ultimate arbiters of the process. War, in other
words, is settled by killing, a bloody transaction that echoes the
exploitative exchanges of capitalism.]{.underline} Marx found this idea
to be both suggestive and pregnant with meaning. So should we all.
Following Marx, [Americans ought to think about war]{.underline} not
just as an extreme exercise of politics, but also [as a continuation of
exploitative commerce by other means.]{.underline} Combat as commerce:
there's more in that than simple alliteration. [In the history of war,
such commercial transactions took many forms, whether as territory
conquered, spoils carted away, raw materials appropriated, or market
share gained**.**]{.underline} Consider American wars. [The War of
1812]{.underline} is sometimes portrayed as a minor dust-up with
Britain, involving the temporary occupation and burning of our capital,
but it really [was about crushing Indians on the frontier and grabbing
their land. The Mexican-American War was another land grab, this time
for the benefit of slaveholders. The Spanish-American War was a land
grab for]{.underline} those seeking [an American empire overseas, while
World War I was for making the world "safe for democracy"]{.underline}
--- [and]{.underline} for [American business interests
globally.]{.underline} Even World War II, a war necessary to stop Hitler
and Imperial Japan, witnessed the emergence of the U.S. as the arsenal
of democracy, the world's dominant power, and the new imperial stand-in
for a bankrupt British Empire. [Korea? Vietnam? Lots of profit for the
military-industrial complex and plenty of power for the Pentagon
establishment. Iraq, the Middle East, current adventures in Africa? Oil,
markets, natural resources, global dominance. In societal calamities
like war,]{.underline} there will always be winners and losers. But [the
clearest winners are often companies like Boeing and Dow Chemical, which
provided B-52 bombers and Agent Orange, respectively, to the U.S.
military in Vietnam. Such "arms merchants**"**]{.underline} --- an
older, more honest term than today's "defense contractor" --- [don't
have to pursue the hard sell, not when war and preparations for it have
become so permanently, inseparably intertwined with the American
economy, foreign policy, and our nation's identity as a rugged land of
"warriors" and "heroes"]{.underline} (more on that in a moment). War as
Disaster Capitalism Consider one more definition of war: not as politics
or even as commerce, but as societal catastrophe. Thinking this way, [we
can apply Naomi Klein's concepts of the "shock doctrine" and "disaster
capitalism**"**]{.underline} to it. [When such disasters occur, there
are **always** those who seek to turn a **profit**. Most Americans are,
however, discouraged from thinking about war this way]{.underline}
thanks to the power of what we call "patriotism" or, at an extreme,
"superpatriotism" when it applies to us, and the significantly more
negative "nationalism" or "ultra-nationalism" when it appears in other
countries. During wars, we're told to "support our troops," to wave the
flag, to put country first, to respect the patriotic ideal of selfless
service and redemptive sacrifice (even if all but 1% of us are never
expected to serve or sacrifice). We're discouraged from reflecting on
the uncomfortable fact that, as "our" troops sacrifice and suffer,
others in society are profiting big time. Such thoughts are considered
unseemly and unpatriotic. [Pay no attention to the war profiteers, who
pass as perfectly respectable companies. After all, any price is worth
paying]{.underline} (or profits worth offering up) [to contain the enemy
--- not so long ago, the red menace, but in the twenty-first century,
the murderous terrorist. Forever war is forever profitable. Think of the
Lockheed Martins of the world. In their commerce with the Pentagon, as
well as the militaries of other nations, they ultimately seek cash
payment for their weapons and a world in which such weaponry will be
eternally needed**.**]{.underline} In the pursuit of security or
victory, political leaders willingly pay their price. Call it a
Clausewitzian/Marxian feedback loop or the dialectic of Carl and Karl.
[It also represents the eternal marriage of combat and
commerce.]{.underline} If it doesn't catch all of what war is about, it
should at least remind us of the degree to which war as disaster
capitalism is driven by profit and power. For a synthesis, we need only
turn from Carl or Karl to Cal --- President Calvin Coolidge, that is.
"The business of America is business," he declared in the Roaring
Twenties. Almost a century later, [the business of America is war, even
if today's presidents are too polite to mention that the business is
booming.]{.underline} America's War Heroes as Commodities Many young
people today are, in fact, looking for a release from consumerism. In
seeking new identities, quite a few turn to the military. And it
provides. Recruits are hailed as warriors and warfighters, as heroes,
and not just within the military either, but by society at large. Yet in
joining the military and being celebrated for that act, our troops
paradoxically become yet another commodity, another consumable of the
state. Indeed, they become consumed by war and its violence. Their
compensation? To be packaged and marketed as the heroes of our
militarized moment. Steven Gardiner, a cultural anthropologist and U.S.
Army veteran, has written eloquently about what he calls the "heroic
masochism" of militarized settings and their allure for America's youth.
Put succinctly, in seeking to escape a consumerism that has lost its
meaning and find a release from dead-end jobs, many volunteers are
transformed into celebrants of violence, seekers and givers of pain, a
harsh reality Americans ignore as long as that violence is acted out
overseas against our enemies and local populations. Such "heroic"
identities, tied so closely to violence in war, often prove poorly
suited to peacetime settings. Frustration and demoralization devolve
into domestic violence and suicide. In an American society with ever
fewer meaningful peacetime jobs, exhibiting greater and greater
polarization of wealth and opportunity, the decisions of some veterans
to turn to or return to mind-numbing drugs of various sorts and
soul-stirring violence is tragically predictable. That it stems from
their exploitative commodification as so many heroic inflictors of
violence in our name is a reality most Americans are content to forget.
You May Not Be Interested in War, but War Is Interested in You As
Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky pithily observed, "You may not be
interested in war, but war is interested in you." [If war is combat and
commerce, calamity and commodity, it cannot be left to our political
leaders alone]{.underline} --- and certainly not to our generals. [When
it comes to war, however far from it we may seem to be, we're all in our
own ways customers and consumers.]{.underline} Some pay a high price.
Many pay a little. A few gain a lot. Keep an eye on those few and you'll
end up with a keener appreciation of what war is actually all about. No
wonder our leaders tell us not to worry our little heads about our wars
--- just support those troops, go shopping, and keep waving that flag.
If [patriotism is]{.underline} famously the last refuge of the
scoundrel, it's also [the first recourse of those seeking to mobilize
customers for the latest bloodletting exercise in combat as
commerce]{.underline}. Just remember: [in the grand bargain that is war,
it's their product and their profit.]{.underline} And that's no bargain
for America, or for that matter for the world.

[The tripling of US arms sales]{.underline} [abroad to a record \$66.3
billion is an accurate barometer of the accelerating drive to war in the
Persian Gulf and on a world scale. This one violently surging sector of
American exports reflects a diseased capitalist economy and society,
whose financial-corporate elite resorts to **militarism** as a means of
offsetting the overall economic decline of the United States. The annual
survey of global arms sales released this week by the Congressional
Research Service]{.underline} (CRS), the policy research arm of the US
Congress, [places the United States number one in the provision of
advanced weaponry to the world by an overwhelming margin.]{.underline}
"In 2011, the US led in arms transfer agreements worldwide, making
agreements valued at \$66.3 billion (77.7 percent of all such
agreements), an extraordinary increase from \$21.4 billion in 2010. The
US worldwide agreements total in 2011 is the largest for a single year
in the history of the US arms export program," according to the report
prepared for Congress. In an earlier period, Washington justified such
weapons deals as part of its Cold War strategy of countering the
influence of the Soviet Union and propping up regimes aligned with the
West against Moscow and its allies. This was under conditions where
Soviet arms sales to the so-called Third World rivaled and even
surpassed those of the United States. [Today]{.underline}, however, as
the CRS report makes clear, [the US accounts for more than three
quarters of global arms deals]{.underline}, with the share of its
closest competitor, Russia, amounting to just 5.6 percent. [The massive
rise in US arms sales is driven by the accelerating turn toward
aggressive war as a means of achieving the strategic global objectives
of US imperialism, combined with the insatiable drive for profit and
power by America's bloated military-industrial complex.]{.underline} The
lion's share of the rise in arms exports is directed to [Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates]{.underline} (UAE), which [together account
for \$38.2 billion of the \$66.3 billion total. The other major sales
were \$2 billion worth of antimissile batteries to
Taiwan]{.underline}---a provocative move aimed against China---[and
\$6.9 billion in arms to India]{.underline}, ratcheting up tensions with
its regional antagonist, Pakistan. The Saudi monarchy's purchase of 84
advanced F-15 fighter planes together with dozens of military
helicopters and other weapons yielded super profits for Boeing and
United Technologies. The regime in the UAE obtained a \$3.5 billion
sophisticated missile defense system, providing rich returns for
Lockheed Martin. The CRS report includes the observation: "[Whereas the
principal motivation for arms sales by key foreign suppliers in earlier
years might have been to support a foreign policy objective, today that
motivation may be based as much, if not more, on economic considerations
as those of foreign or national security policy."]{.underline} [In
reality, these foreign policy objectives and economic interests feed
each other. The military-industrial complex]{.underline} that the former
general Dwight D. Eisenhower warned against at the end of his presidency
a half-century ago [has grown to gargantuan proportions, dominating the
US government and both major parties and playing a grossly
disproportionate role in the American economy. It provides a powerful
impetus to both militarism abroad and the assault on democratic rights
at home. The purchases by the monarchical regimes in the Arab world
stem]{.underline}, on the one hand, from their reaction to the popular
upheavals that were dubbed the "Arab Spring" and, on the other, [from
the buildup by the US and its allies for another war]{.underline}, this
time against Iran. The House of Saud, which runs Saudi Arabia as a
family fiefdom, saw in the events in Tunisia, Egypt and particularly
Bahrain, where its troops were used to suppress mass protests, a mortal
threat to its absolutist rule. An essential part of its response is the
dramatic expansion of its military apparatus. [The buildup to war
against Iran, just as the one that preceded the war of aggression
against Iraq a decade ago, has been publicly justified as a response to
the supposed threat posed by "weapons of mass destruction."]{.underline}
The US and its allies have claimed that Iran's nuclear program is
directed at producing nuclear weapons, a charge repeatedly denied by the
government in Iran, which insists the program is for peaceful purposes.
[The hypocrisy of these charges against Iran, which have provided the
pretext for ~~crippling~~ sanctions, the deployment of a US air and sea
armada in the Persian Gulf, and threats by Israel and the US of an
unprovoked military assault, is evident in the figures provided by the
US arms sales report. The amount of weaponry Washington sold to the
Saudi and UAE regimes alone last year amounted to nearly six times
Iran's entire military budget.]{.underline} The US geo-strategic
objective in sponsoring these weapons sales is to create potently armed
regional proxies for a war for regime-change in Iran. This process is
already playing out in Syria, where Washington's major arms
customers---Saudi Arabia and the UAE---are openly sponsoring the
so-called rebels seeking the overthrow of Iran's principal Arab ally,
the government of Bashar al-Assad. [This sponsorship has extended to the
creation of a \$100 million fund to pay the salaries of the militias
challenging the Syrian government, as well as the provision of weapons,
which is being coordinated by the CIA in Turkey and undoubtedly on the
ground in Syria itself. The preparations for war against Iran are
directed at tightening US hegemony over the energy-rich regions of the
Persian Gulf and the Caspian Sea, which the landmass of Iran
spans]{.underline}. In that sense, the aggression being prepared against
Iran and its people under Obama is in pursuit of the same aims that
underlay the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq launched under Bush. [The arms
industry is massively subsidized by the American taxpayer.]{.underline}
While the political establishment and media insist "there is no money"
when it comes to jobs, decent wages, education and vital public
services, [endless billions are lavished on America's merchants of
death. American working people neither share in this industry's
state-subsidized profits nor have any say over its sale of powerful
weapons systems to reactionary regimes. Just as mass opposition emerged
to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, there is similar popular hostility
to arming the Saudi and UAE monarchs to the teeth, not to mention being
dragged into yet another war, this time against Iran. The disappearance
of any mass protest against war is a reflection]{.underline} not of
popular sentiment, but rather [of the reactionary politics of a
privileged middle class layer of pseudo-lefts that deliberately worked
to channel anti-war sentiment behind Obama and the Democratic Party. A
new mass movement against war can be built only through an
irreconcilable break with the Democratic Party and the US two-party
system. What is required is the independent political mobilization of
the working class on the basis of a socialist program, including the
conversion of the arms industry into publicly owned facilities dedicated
to production for human needs rather than mass slaughter.]{.underline}

#### Trumps base loves the military -- fourth of July rally proves

**Mason 7-5** (Jeff Mason, American political journalist who has
previously worked as the president of the White house correspondents
Association, 7-5-2019, \"Defying critics, Trump salutes military in
pomp-filled July 4\...,\" U.S.,

[With U.S. fighter jets flying overhead, President Donald Trump praised
the military]{.underline} and reveled in a show of pomp and patriotism
on Thursday in a celebration of Independence Day that critics accused
him of turning into a political event. Trump, a Republican who was
inspired to stage the flashy affair after seeing a similar display in
France, dismissed concerns ahead of the ceremony about the expense and
militaristic overtones of the event outside the 97-year-old Lincoln
Memorial, a symbol of national unity. ["Our nation is stronger today
than it ever was before. It is its strongest now," Trump said from a
platform in front of the famous memorial, echoing a theme he uses at
campaign rallies.]{.underline} Flanked by Bradley fighting vehicles,
Trump otherwise steered clear of divisive political rhetoric, in a
departure from the majority of his speeches. At times, [an enthusiastic
crowd could be heard chanting: "USA! USA! USA!"]{.underline} Trump, 73,
praised American military might despite having himself avoided the draft
during the Vietnam War with bone spurs in his feet. With well-planned
choreography, he told stories about each military branch before
separate, dramatic flyovers of their respective military aircraft. ["We
celebrate our history, our people, and the heroes who proudly defend our
flag: the brave men and women of the United States military," Trump
said. "For over 65 years, no enemy Air Force has managed to kill a
single American soldier. Because the skies belong to the United States
of America."]{.underline} Not all the choreography appeared to go off as
planned. A flyover by Air Force One, which Trump had teased earlier in
the day on Twitter, occurred unannounced and without fanfare. But a low
and spectacular flyover by six F-18s known as the "Blue Angels" at the
conclusion of Trump's speech thrilled the crowd. Some people shouted
"Four More Years!" in support of the president. Trump paid tribute to
the U.S. Border Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, two
agencies that have played leading roles in carrying out his tough
immigration policies. He cited as great Americans both Harriet Tubman
and Frederick Douglass, African-Americans who campaigned for the
abolition of slavery more than 100 years ago. That praise could draw
criticism as Trump's administration in May decided to keep Tubman's
image off the \$20 bill. He previously raised doubts about his knowledge
of Douglass by speaking of the former slave in the present tense as
"somebody who's done an amazing job." [Earlier in the day thousands of
supporters wearing Trump's signature "Make America Great Again"
hats]{.underline}, along with opponents questioning the cost of the
event, [poured into the U.S. capital]{.underline} despite scorching
temperatures and intermittent rain, while a diapered "Baby Trump"
balloon sat next to a banner calling Trump a traitor. Protesters burned
a U.S. flag in front of the White House. Ahead of the speech, Democrats
accused the president of staging an out-of-place campaign rally, aware
he has a history of veering off script with sharp partisan attacks even
at events that are not meant to be overtly political. [Trump supporters
and opponents carried American flags and wore red, white and blue
outfits. "I think what Trump's doing with the tanks, all the flyovers, I
think it's great," said Brandon Lawrence, his face painted with the
colors of the American flag.]{.underline}

"There is confusion about the Putin-Trump relationship," Major General
Volodymyr Havrylov, Ukraine's defense attaché to the U.S., told me last
month. "And an element of unpredictability. But we believe in checks and
balances in the United States." Former National-Security Adviser H.R.
McMaster and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis pushed for Trump to approve
the lethal weapons sale to Ukraine, according to Havyrlov and another
U.S. official familiar with the deal who requested anonymity to discuss
it freely. [Trump was convinced]{.underline}, at least in part, [by the
fact that President Barack Obama---to whom Trump frequently compares
himself---had balked at the sale. The official relayed a conversation
between Trump and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko last year in
which Trump asked why Obama had "done nothing when Russia invaded
Crimea."]{.underline} (Obama sanctioned Russia over the incursion in
2014.) [The Ukrainian government hired Haley Barbour, former Republican
National Committee chairman and founding partner of BGR Group, to lobby
in the United States just after Trump was elected, according to
foreign-lobbying registration documents filed with the Justice
Department]{.underline}. [Ed Rogers, the chairman of BGR, was hired for
the lobbying work, too. The firm has ties to this White House: The Trump
transition team held meetings with lobbyists at BGR Group's
offices]{.underline}, according to [The Washington
Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/10/06/trump-transition-team-and-gop-lobbyists-are-inching-toward-mutual-acceptance/?utm_term=.aa3703ed7386).
And Rogers is "as inner-circle Jeff Sessions as they come," a source
with knowledge of their relationship told me on condition of anonymity,
referring to Attorney General Jeff Sessions. (Both men are from
Alabama.) BGR also worked with Corey Lewandowski, Trump's former
campaign manager who still visits the White House regularly, as recently
as last summer, [The Daily
Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-corey-lewandowski-fcked-over-a-david-petraeus-linked-socialite-to-become-the-polish-arms-industrys-man-in-dc) reported.
